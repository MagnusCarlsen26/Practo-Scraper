Some medicines would cause swelling, some would cause a sensation of nausea or dryness in the mouth. My family Dr, whom I have been in touch with last 30 years got irritated. But, Dr Amit never lost patience. I He kept trying new medicines, and finally, her BP was controlled. \n\nGod bless you, Dr Amit.\n\n ",

A hospital can be a daunting place for anybody, especially for someone in their 70s'. But thanks to Dr Mittal, Dr. Das and their excellent team, my dad was treated with utmost care and efficiency.  He was prescient with his diagnosis, excellent in his treatment and generous with giving us his time during those stressful days of hospitalization. The open-heart surgery and valve replacement went smoothly at Apollo and the post-operative care under his guidance was top notch. \n\nEven though my parents live in another part of the country, Dr Mittal is always responsive, reachable, just a call away, sparing his valuable time to still glance at test reports or take an occasional video call to give us his medical advice without charging a penny. \n\nI have nothing but gratitude and respect for his expertise, his humility and the empathy with which he treats his patients. He has my father's blessings.",

We went to escorts and then to medantta for second opinion. Somehow, someone introduced us to Dr. Amit Mittal in Apollo only and he was like an angel to us. Except for him everyone has suggested bypass, but he understood us and our inhibitions and suggested angioplasty. He made us understand the procedure and we got relief after just meeting with Dr. Amit. Dr. Amit did the angioplasty the very next day and everything went well. It's been 2 years now. My mother is doing well and with god's grace and with Dr. Amit's experience, I am sure she will continue to be healthy.\nThanks a ton from our whole family.",

Within 5min i got another call from her daughter regarding same issues, as iam busy with some of my personal problem so i ask her that just now received a call from your mother and pls dont call again and again . To this she start threatening me that i cant talk like this so i cut the call saying i cant help you ( i have the call recording). After 10min i myself called her daughter saying that look doctor do have there families and there personal problem so try to understand for which she says that she will put a bad review about me on public forum and no patient will visit me. I again replied that i have my patient base and didnt need her recommendation. I also asked her that if her mother wants to talk to me she call me just to end the conversation(i have call recording of that)\n\nThis feedback is totally one sided story as a Doctors do have there families and problem but patients like these wants a doctor to be available everytime they call and if doctor dont respond at that time they will threaten the doctor. With this type of behaviour of yours you will never receive a good consultation as you yourself have mentioned in clinic to have changes many doctors.",

You start feeling better after meeting him.\n\nFortis, Shalimar Bagh, and Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh hospital is just a 5-minute drive from my home. But I still travel for 1 and a half hr just to meet him. \n\nMy mother's BP was touching 200/100. And she is so sensitive that a lot of BP medicines didn't suit her. Some medicines would cause swelling, some would cause a sensation of nausea or dryness in the mouth. My family Dr, whom I have been in touch with last 30 years got irritated. But, Dr Amit never lost patience. I He kept trying new medicines, and finally, her BP was controlled. \n\nGod bless you, Dr Amit.\n\n ",

A hospital can be a daunting place for anybody, especially for someone in their 70s'. But thanks to Dr Mittal, Dr. Das and their excellent team, my dad was treated with utmost care and efficiency.  He was prescient with his diagnosis, excellent in his treatment and generous with giving us his time during those stressful days of hospitalization. The open-heart surgery and valve replacement went smoothly at Apollo and the post-operative care under his guidance was top notch. \n\nEven though my parents live in another part of the country, Dr Mittal is always responsive, reachable, just a call away, sparing his valuable time to still glance at test reports or take an occasional video call to give us his medical advice without charging a penny. \n\nI have nothing but gratitude and respect for his expertise, his humility and the empathy with which he treats his patients. He has my father's blessings.",

We went to escorts and then to medantta for second opinion. Somehow, someone introduced us to Dr. Amit Mittal in Apollo only and he was like an angel to us. Except for him everyone has suggested bypass, but he understood us and our inhibitions and suggested angioplasty. He made us understand the procedure and we got relief after just meeting with Dr. Amit. Dr. Amit did the angioplasty the very next day and everything went well. It's been 2 years now. My mother is doing well and with god's grace and with Dr. Amit's experience, I am sure she will continue to be healthy.\nThanks a ton from our whole family.",

Respect for such doctors and their team including Sachin in Apollo Hospital. ",

Within 5min i got another call from her daughter regarding same issues, as iam busy with some of my personal problem so i ask her that just now received a call from your mother and pls dont call again and again . To this she start threatening me that i cant talk like this so i cut the call saying i cant help you ( i have the call recording). After 10min i myself called her daughter saying that look doctor do have there families and there personal problem so try to understand for which she says that she will put a bad review about me on public forum and no patient will visit me. I again replied that i have my patient base and didnt need her recommendation. I also asked her that if her mother wants to talk to me she call me just to end the conversation(i have call recording of that)\n\nThis feedback is totally one sided story as a Doctors do have there families and problem but patients like these wants a doctor to be available everytime they call and if doctor dont respond at that time they will threaten the doctor. With this type of behaviour of yours you will never receive a good consultation as you yourself have mentioned in clinic to have changes many doctors.",
