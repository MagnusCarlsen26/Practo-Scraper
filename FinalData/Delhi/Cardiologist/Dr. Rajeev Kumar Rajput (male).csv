"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Hypertension Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Wait time for the appointment was as mentioned. Doctor examined me clinically and even measured my BP on his own, which nowadays is rarely seen. He took a very careful clinical history and saw all the previous health records meticulously. The prescribed medications were explained and were easily available in the nearby pharmacy. I am optimistic that with the treatment, my BP would be in control with time.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Cardiac Ablation,",0,0,NO,"Very unprofessional. I booked an appointment with the doctor using apollo 247 app for my mother when she complained of chest pain. Dr. Rajeeve suggested a few tests to diagnose the problem. After submitting the test reports on the app, there is no response from the doctor. I raised this to the apollo support team and since 3 days they are asking me to wait for 24 hours and then they asked me to book another appointment by paying another 1500 rupees. If this is about money, you can raise the consultation fee but don't play such mimics with the families of the patients who are already dealing with the pandemic. And, if it is not about the money, you should be responsible enough to not make the patients dealing with such serious illness wait for treatment",2021-06-07 04:45:07,False,False,Prateek Aggarwal,,,
