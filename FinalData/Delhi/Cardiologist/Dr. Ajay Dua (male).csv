"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"I did an angiography test of my mother from Dr. Ajay in Dec.2019. After the test he suggested my mother for a bypass surgery from Max hospital.  

But we consulted a heart specialist ** ******** *** ** *** ********* *** *** ****** ***** ** ** ** **** ********** ** **** ****** ***** ******** *** ***** ** ** **** *** ****** ****** ********"" 

Now after 10 months when we were suggested to go for another angiography. We went to Dr. Ajay. as he used to do these test in Govt. hospital which is near to us. Dr. Ajay denied to do test as we didn't go for surgery as per his recommendation. then after requesting several times he started some other tests after taking payment of Rs. 3000/- and told us that if my mother's report comes negative in these test only then he will do angiography. And report came negative, even then he denied angiography.

This is how this doctor treats his patients. He refers the patients to a specific hospital and if patient goes any where else. he denies to serve the patient next time.

That also means your mother’s blockages has not reduced  with medicines that’s why Artemis doctor has suggested  repeat angiography in less than 1 year. That s why you were suggested bypass by Dr Ajay as medicine were unlikely to reduce blockages. If you wanted an angiography at Artemis than why didn’t you got it done from there.If patient wants a repeat angiography suggested by some other doctor than every doctor has right to use his or her acumen to do it or not to do it.

Your allegations are because doctor didn’t  obeyed your order of angiography as suggested to you by Artemis doctor",2019-10-12T18:54:13+0000,Dr. Ajay Dua
