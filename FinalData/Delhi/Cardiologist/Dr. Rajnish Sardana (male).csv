,,0,0,NO,"** *** *** ******* *** ******** *** **** ***** **** *********** ***** *** ** ***** Dr. Rajnish Sardana is rude, lacks empathy towards the patient or their family, will not explain or give any insights into patient’s health, improvement or recovery. His ideal patient would be those who would just sit and listen to his condescending remarks and will get all tests done from Manipal’s expensive facility. If you are not that person, then I am quite sure you will leave appalled, frustrated and completely unsatisfied. 

** ** ****** ********* *** * ****** *** doesn’t take time to listen or explain you things and god forbid if you ask for clarification on something more than once. He will make sure you feel that you know nothing and are brainless.

We went there for my mother, who is a cancer patient and had adverse effects on her heart. We got her ECG and echo test done from outside, which the doctor frowned upon. He wants tests to be done at manipal. We asked for ways that her heart can improve, a particular question being around physical exercise since he said no medicine can improve heart’s condition. Instead of taking time to explain us, he fired back snobbishly asking how can physical activity improve it. 

For a layman, all a patient can do is ask question, it’s the doctor’s duty to clarify our doubts and misinformation, if any. I have taken out time to write this review and I don’t last remember the last time or even if I have ever wrote a negative review for a doctor. I hope this review helps someone ** ******** * ****** ****** *** ****** * **** *** *** ******** ** **** **** *** ********* *** ** ******** *********",2020-08-25 09:41:00,False,False,Rijul,,,
,,0,0,NO,"I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. He is RUDE, *** ** **** *** ******* **** *** ******** My dad was supposed to go for a surgery for which we needed heart clearance test done. Sardana was so arrogant, *** * ***** ** ** ***** *** ***** ** ** ** ****** **** *** **** *** *** ************* What makes it okay for him to treat a person who just suffered from a stroke and going to have a surgery with such disregard and with no respect.

Also he gave us 5 mins of his time* ********** ****** *** to go take the test and after the test we literally had one small doubt about if we should come back and he will sign off on the report or the report is enough as a clearance if normal and he refused to answer us and said go take an appointment again for him to answer if we need to see him again or not.
