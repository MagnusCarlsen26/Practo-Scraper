"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pacemaker Implantation,Cardioversion,",0,0,YES,Dr. Rajnish Sardana is treating my father from past more than 10 years (Fortis/Metro/Apollo and now in Jaypee). He is genuine in his approach and patient's best possible care is his top priority. He is expert in pacemaker and related diseases management.,2018-09-20 16:27:23,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,"** *** *** ******* *** ******** *** **** ***** **** *********** ***** *** ** ***** Dr. Rajnish Sardana is rude, lacks empathy towards the patient or their family, will not explain or give any insights into patient’s health, improvement or recovery. His ideal patient would be those who would just sit and listen to his condescending remarks and will get all tests done from Manipal’s expensive facility. If you are not that person, then I am quite sure you will leave appalled, frustrated and completely unsatisfied. 

** ** ****** ********* *** * ****** *** doesn’t take time to listen or explain you things and god forbid if you ask for clarification on something more than once. He will make sure you feel that you know nothing and are brainless.

We went there for my mother, who is a cancer patient and had adverse effects on her heart. We got her ECG and echo test done from outside, which the doctor frowned upon. He wants tests to be done at manipal. We asked for ways that her heart can improve, a particular question being around physical exercise since he said no medicine can improve heart’s condition. Instead of taking time to explain us, he fired back snobbishly asking how can physical activity improve it. 

For a layman, all a patient can do is ask question, it’s the doctor’s duty to clarify our doubts and misinformation, if any. I have taken out time to write this review and I don’t last remember the last time or even if I have ever wrote a negative review for a doctor. I hope this review helps someone ** ******** * ****** ****** *** ****** * **** *** *** ******** ** **** **** *** ********* *** ** ******** *********",2020-08-25 09:41:00,False,False,Rijul,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Heart Conditions,",0,0,NO,"I went to see a Neurologist at Jaypee hospital and the Neurologist suggested me to see Dr
 Sardana who is a cardiologist at Jaypee Hospital. I had no plan to see cardiologist (as I got discharged from Metro Heart Institute same day morning after through assessment for 2 days) or know who Dr. Sardana is, but thought to follow the neurologist advice. 
Since moving in his chamber, it was clear that Dr. Shardana is not the mosy friendly doctor. No courtesy, empathy or human feeling towards a patient or patient party. Started questioning on why we cam to see him without reports even before asking whether we are historical carrying reports or not. We had all reports with us.
My dad has been a cardiac patient for 2 decades and been to a lot of doctors and hospitals, and shown him some of the recent prescriptions  for a quick background. He was resistant and conveyed the tone that we shouldn't have come to him and should have visited the cardiologist we consult regularly in Delhi. The language conveyed that he wants us to treat him as supreme and have full trust in him..only then he will treat my dad.
I had all reports from Metro Heart Institute and the Pacemaker (implanted 17 yrs ago) tested same say by an engineer from the OEM, but Dr. Sardana refused to accept it and said he doesnt trust them and I should go ahead and make payment for re assessment of pacemaker (the pacemaker in this case was not implanted by him).  
When I refused to take immediate decisions or reassessment of the pacemaker by him, but said will take time to think and get back, he said he will not treat my dad as I don't have confidence in him!! Cant a patient or patient party has their rights to take second opinion specially as it was not a life critical moment? I assume it has to be the responsibility of the Doctor to explain the whole thing in details instead of challenging patient party just because they wanted a second opinion or regularly visit another doctor. There was a whole lot of events and let me tell you, this is not something I can postin Practo!Jaypee is a fantastic hospital and takes great care of patients, but Doctors needs to be careful that the reputation and brand of popular healthcare providers like Jaypee depends on them.
