None,None,0,0,YES,"I visited to Doctor to take opinion regarding implantation of Pacemaker as other Doctor suggested for it but he had not explained the reason and other things. Dr Vineet carefully listen the issue and explained us for requirement of the pacemaker and further he implanted Pacemaker on 05th Nov 2019. Post implantation father discharged and he was fine, on 18th Nov he complained for fever Doctor immediately attended us and suggest for admission. During admission a lot of investigation done but no infection noticed. His overall support during entire investigation was excellent. First time I had seen that a doctor is taking so much step at their own and totally concern about his patient. His behavior is very polite and he is always contactable to his patient.
Thank you Dr Vineet for all your support during admission till discharge of my Father.

I recommend to everyone for any Cardio issue to Dr Vineet Bhatia.
