"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Non-Invasive Cardiology,",0,0,YES,"Visited Dr. Kapur for my father. He clearly understood the condition in one go and even told us the symptoms that he might be facing (which he actually was).
He diagnosed the disease correctly (Postural Hypo tension - which mind you a few big names didn't) and helped us understand the same. Finally the Echo results showed my father's heart was doing well and it was postural hypo tension.
Wait time varies on each visit but generally is less than an hour. The experience was great overall.
