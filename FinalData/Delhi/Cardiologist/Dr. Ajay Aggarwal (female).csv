,"2D - Echocardiography (2D-Echo),Echocardiography,",0,0,YES,"The experience was good in their clinic.
Doctor listened to all the queries with patience and then performed Echocardiography and 2D Echocardiography and just found out that there wasn't any problem it may be just because of Daily lifestyle or acidity ",2022-10-17 15:56:30,False,True,Ashutosh Roy,,,
"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Hypertension Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Visited Dr. Ajay seeing practo reviews. But all its true in this case. Dr. Ajay is lost in looking for patient queue and how many patients were there. We visited today and were the first one and the doctor completely engrossed in his own thoughts. Didn't pay any attention and prescribe *** ****** medicine. We told the first one prescribed didn't help in reduction of BP but he was little concerned about it.
Not at all a good clinic I would say

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Heart Conditions,",0,0,YES,"  He is a great  doctor  , he listens  patiently to each n every suffering of a patient.   He will suggest  only necessary  test and prescribed  medication.  His consultation  charges are also nominal  in comparison  to other cardiologists in north west  Delhi.  I'll definitely  recommend  this doctor for any cardiac problem.
