Since I  visited the clinic (on the strong recommendations of a senior govt.

Visited again on 24 may. 
Meanwhile I suffered severe  pain in one of my teeth. I consulted learned Dr on 25 may and subsequently visited clinic at mayur vihar on 26 may Dr did not attend me personally instead one junior did. Till date I have been suffering for the same after a long gap of more than  two 
weeks.out of five sittings Dr himself has taken three whereas two by juniors. I have been told that teeth severely infected same time anti bio.  course taken. 
I am 63 year plus and undergone many RCT but this time much longer time. The cause/reason best known to Dr.
