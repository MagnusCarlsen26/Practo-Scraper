None,"Crowns and Bridges Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I flew from Singapore to Delhi In Mar 2016, specifically for my dental treatment at SCODE (after hearing favourable experiences from friends) and was treated by both Dr Anurag Singh and Dr Meghna Singh.

As someone who is extremely fearful of dental treatments, I am particularly very selective regarding the choice of my dentist.

At every stage of the root canal treatment, they would also take extreme care to have X-rays taken to ensure that all are in order. 

With improvements in technology, there will always be better dental equipments offered in the industry but professional dental treatments that are personalised and delivered by passionate and dedicated dentists are rare.Throughout the period of my treatment, I was blessed to receive their undivided attention and care. 

As I had specifically flown in for this dental treatment, there were many instances where Dr Meghna had to dedicate the entire day for me.Given the magnitude of my treatments, it was extremely time and cost efficient for me as the same Quality treatment would have taken me so much longer and cost so much more in Singapore.

None,None,0,0,YES,"Highest Recommendation to Dr. Anurag and Dr. Meghna at SCODE, Safdarjung Enclave, Delhi

I‚Äôm writing this letter to sincerely thank Dr. Anurag for successfully performing a very complicated jaw surgery (Maxillofacial) on me after I suffered multiple fractures and dislocated my jaw losing almost all my teeth and jaw functionality. I had already gone through multiple jaw correction surgeries however my problem was never rested and therefore I started my research to find the best doctor to get this surgery done for one last time and I'm I am so glad that I did my research and chose his practice. 

In a time when medical care has increasingly been more about running a business than about patient care, you and Dr. Meghna are an outstanding example of why the field of healthcare need doctors like you. Your skills and experience is what sets you and your team apart from so many professionals today. I have recently moved to Australia but if I ever need any dental medicare I  would travel to India to get his expertise, he is simply the BEST!

I will happily refer anyone that needs oral surgery to Dr. Anurag. Thank you again, and I wish you and your team all the success in future.
