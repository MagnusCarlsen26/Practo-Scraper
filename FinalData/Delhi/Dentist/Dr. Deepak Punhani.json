I just go to Punhani nd get relaxed cz I know they deliver the best. be it Dr. Punhani or Dr. Tanmay or Dr. Dhriti. I have a blind faith on their team. Thank you so much as  whatever I got done from there , every visit for me was really smooth. Good luck to the entire team. i strongly recommend, go there without giving a second thought.And guys who say here that they did not try their best nd they feel these people could hv done this or that, i would say ,their team knows their job well. so better not to teach or pinpoint. If u dnt trust ur own doctor u can never be happy with the line of treatment. I have visited them six times for different treatments nd trust me I felt every penny charged was worth. so, thnx again ",

I stay in Gurgaon and got to know about Dr. Deepak Punhani of the renowned Punhani Tooth Care Dental Clinic in DG-2 block of Vikas Puri,New Delhi from one of my friends. I visited the clinic and my treatment started soon after that. **** ** ********** * *** ******* **** *** ****** ******* ** *** ** *** *** *** ************ *** *************** ******* He is soft spoken, very friendly and cleared all my doubts and fears in the very first visit. He has excellent team of doctors that includes Dr. Shweta Punhani and other dentists who are experts in their specific field of dentistry. The moment Dr. Deepak starts working on your tooth, you realize that you are in best of hands. His focus on ensuring the sterilization and disinfection, style of work and body language itself would reassure the patient further. Dr. Punhani is very passionate towards his craft. I have already got my dental implants procedure done by Dr. Deepak and his team and now I am looking forward to visit the clinic again for my next stage of treatment soon.

I just go to Punhani nd get relaxed cz I know they deliver the best. be it Dr. Punhani or Dr. Tanmay or Dr. Dhriti. I have a blind faith on their team. Thank you so much as  whatever I got done from there , every visit for me was really smooth. Good luck to the entire team. i strongly recommend, go there without giving a second thought.And guys who say here that they did not try their best nd they feel these people could hv done this or that, i would say ,their team knows their job well. so better not to teach or pinpoint. If u dnt trust ur own doctor u can never be happy with the line of treatment. I have visited them six times for different treatments nd trust me I felt every penny charged was worth. so, thnx again ",

He has excellent team of doctors that includes Dr. Shweta Punhani and other dentists who are experts in their specific field of dentistry. The moment Dr. Deepak starts working on your tooth, you realize that you are in best of hands. His focus on ensuring the sterilization and disinfection, style of work and body language itself would reassure the patient further. Dr. Punhani is very passionate towards his craft.
