"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Gap Closing,",0,0,YES,"I had gap issues in multiple teeth from childhood.  When i grew older like 16-17 , i always felt uncomfortable while smiling, specially in occasions. I started working on my own when i shifted from my hometown Allahabad to Delhi for college. I saved money which I get from my parents on monthly basis for hoping to get a new smile...i visited a dentist earlier but wasn't satisfied as they asked for large sum of money. Then I found Dr.. Pearl, as the name sounds beautiful as pearl, so is she. she gave me perfect smile today within my budget that was so satisfactory...Thanks to Dr, Pearl and her team❤️",2023-05-15 15:50:11,False,True,Aditya Kumar,,,
