"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,Dental Examinations,Scaling / Polishing,",0,0,YES,"I have been visiting Dr Sanchi Chabbra for dental treatment for the past nearly one year . I must say that Dr Sanchi is very professional with her work. She makes you very comfortable throughout the treatment and has a very genuine concern for her patient's dental health.

She is a very pleasant doctor and describes the entire procedure in depth with patience and is very accommodative with the appointments and scheduling. The best treatment for the patient is actually practiced in the clinic very ethically at the most reasonable cost feasible. Her clinic in Defence Colony has a very fine ambience and cleanliness.¬†

I must say that being a retired Army Colonel I am entitled to free Dental treatment at Army Dental clinics/ECHS empaneled clinics but still I prefer to undertake Dental treatment from Dr Sanchi because of her professionalism and dedication towards her patients.¬†

I strongly recommend her to anyone looking for good dental care in New Delhi/ NCR. She has excellent staff, like Ms. Kajal at the Reception and good clinical assistant too. Thank you Dr Sanchi Chabbra.¬†",2024-08-06 15:20:06,False,True,Colonel Vinod,,,

One is made comfortable through out the treatment.

What is actually needed and what is best for you is actually practiced in the clinic which has such a good ambience as well as a clean and a comfortable feel. 
I don't think me and my family can go anywhere else, even if we have to travel all the way from Gurgaon.
