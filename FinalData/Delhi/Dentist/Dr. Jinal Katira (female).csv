None,None,0,0,YES,"I visited Jinal twice during my trip to Delhi. She performed 3 fillings and complete dental cleaning.
She is quite experienced and is very talented.
Also didn't recommend anything which is not required.

She replied instantly everytime I called her and her behaviour is super nice.
You feel like talking to a friend and not a doctor.
I highly recommend her.
