I had treatment for 4 teeth's it took some time to finish my treatment completely but I am very happy with the final results. He is very professional and experienced with perfectionist nature in terms of treatment. I also have phobia with dental treatment as I have not visited dental clinic for the past 20 years or more but the way he dealed with me gave me confidence to proceed further with my treatment. And I am happy that without any pain I completed my treatment successfully. My teeth is not severe but I feel embarrassed when both side of my teeth is missing, that\u2019s why I had to smile cautiously or with limits in order to hide that side before treatment. But After treatment now I can click pictures confidently and smile from all angles \ud83d\ude0a I would highly recommend him and I am planning to take my known friends for their treatments. ",

He is very professional and experienced with perfectionist nature in terms of treatment. I also have phobia with dental treatment as I have not visited dental clinic for the past 20 years or more but the way he dealed with me gave me confidence to proceed further with my treatment. And I am happy that without any pain I completed my treatment successfully. My teeth is not severe but I feel embarrassed when both side of my teeth is missing, that\u2019s why I had to smile cautiously or with limits in order to hide that side before treatment. But After treatment now I can click pictures confidently and smile from all angles \ud83d\ude0a I would highly recommend him and I am planning to take my known friends for their treatments. ",
