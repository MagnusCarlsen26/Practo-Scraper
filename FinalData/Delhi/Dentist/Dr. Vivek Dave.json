Deep rooted wisdom tooth surgical extraction was one of the most complicated procedures (even according to statistical records of such cases) with a long post op care and recovery time. The surgery done by Dr. Adithya Kwatra and Dr. Dave was smooth with extreme sensitivity to keep me mentally prepared for any pain that was to be anticipated. Guidance through the procedure is very important for any patient who is under local anaesthesia and knows what's going on during the surgery. That guidance was key to a satisfactory procedure for me. Furthermore, the support throughout post op care was amazing. I could text Dr. Dave at any point in time and he would revert with his advice as promptly as he could. \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Dave for the affordable dental care as well. The procedure I got done was charged 1/3rd at his clinic as compared to others. He was very frank about the affordablity he provides even with his consultation fee, which is only Rs. 200! \n\nI'm very satisfied and happy to have found Dr. Dave as the go to dentist and me and my family would love to maintain a long term association with him.",

The doctor examined and suggested extraction of wisdom tooth upon examining the xray. The surgical procedure he performed was brilliant. The doctor makes sure to keep you very calm and relaxed while operating. The tooth was extracted successfully with minimal pain. I strongly recommend Dr. Dave for all dental related health issues.

Dr. Dave is truly the new age Doctor who is using technology in the best way to minimize the wait & maximize the service & experience of his patients... \nA big thank you to practo team who introduced me to Dr. Vivek Dave..

Deep rooted wisdom tooth surgical extraction was one of the most complicated procedures (even according to statistical records of such cases) with a long post op care and recovery time. The surgery done by Dr. Adithya Kwatra and Dr. Dave was smooth with extreme sensitivity to keep me mentally prepared for any pain that was to be anticipated. Guidance through the procedure is very important for any patient who is under local anaesthesia and knows what's going on during the surgery. That guidance was key to a satisfactory procedure for me. Furthermore, the support throughout post op care was amazing. I could text Dr. Dave at any point in time and he would revert with his advice as promptly as he could. \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Dave for the affordable dental care as well. The procedure I got done was charged 1/3rd at his clinic as compared to others. He was very frank about the affordablity he provides even with his consultation fee, which is only Rs. 200! \n\nI'm very satisfied and happy to have found Dr. Dave as the go to dentist and me and my family would love to maintain a long term association with him.",

The doctor makes sure to keep you very calm and relaxed while operating. The tooth was extracted successfully with minimal pain. I strongly recommend Dr. Dave for all dental related health issues.
