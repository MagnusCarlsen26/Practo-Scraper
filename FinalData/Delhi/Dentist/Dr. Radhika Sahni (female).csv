To give some context, I am at high risk of Jaw Osteonecrosis, which causes the jaw bone to collapse, so any dental work - even a simple cavity becomes a high risk procedure. Add to that, I needed molar tooth extraction, which was heavily infected. And needed  multiple cavity and root-canal treatments. So needless to say my anxiety was at it's peak. 

Dr Radhika took the time to understand my phycology and gave comfort and trust just like a family member. Then she made a detailed treatment plan for each tooth and explained how she was mitigating any risks. She din't rush the treatment or suggest any excessive treatment, and provided the least invasive procedures with very quick recovery time. While pain was the least of my concerns, but I can gladly say that after each treatment I had to literally ask her if it's done as I din't feel a thing :)
