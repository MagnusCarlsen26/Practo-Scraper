The staff is welcoming and nice, most importantly they help my kid relax and have a good experience at the dentist. The clinic is so kid friendly and that makes our visits be fun. I feel like they provided a lot useful information in every one of our visits. Dr. Henna never rushes us, but always explains what is going on with our kid and what‚Äôs her recommendations are. Highly recommend this practice, specially if you have little ones who are nervous about seeing the dentist.

Patient Handling is Beyond A+ Experience. When i went with my 5 year Old son for the first time I was more panicky assuming myself being on the same chair. But my notions went off in no time when I saw Dr. Sugandha talking to my son as if they were long age friends that helped making him so comfortable to get the best of cooperation on dental chair.
