"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"I am writing this testimonial to thank Dr. Rajat Sachdeva and I feel privileged to have benefitted from his services. For background, I had multiple amalgam fillings in my teeth that I had got done around 10 years back. It was until very late that I realized that these fillings contains mercury which can cause numerous side effects. 
I had been suffering from painful sores for the last few years, almost since the time I got these amalgam fillings. I never could understand the reason behind this and neither did my previous dentist. The sores were unrelenting and so painful that I wasn’t able to eat or even talk properly. No amount of antibiotics or painkillers would work and I had a constant burning sensation in my mouth. Fortunately, when one of my friends recommended Dr. Rajat Sachdeva’s clinic in Ashok Vihar, I immediately visited him. After a thorough examination and consultation, Dr. Rajat informed me that my mouth sores and ulcers were actually because of the amalgam fillings containing mercury. He suggested that we immediately remove these and replace them with non-metallic, biocompatible composite material. After my wilful consent, Dr. Rajat proceeded with the treatment and almost immediately, my sores disappeared and has not recurred ever since. 
SMART (Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Technique) was followed while strictly adhering to all the safety regulations. An amalgam separator was specially installed which was utilized to collect the mercury and the operating room was well-ventilated with a high-volume air filtration system. I was made to wear the protective gear including nasal masks, gowns and head cover. The entire team assisting the procedure including Dr. Rajat were well-protected too. A rubber was used to avoid any spillage and all the materials used were non-latex and sterile. The entire procedure was done with High speed evacuation and with utmost precision. Once the procedure was over, the operating team carefully eliminated and disposed mercury wastage while maintaining all the safety protocols. The level of professionalism seen was highly reassuring.
I am extremely thankful to Dr. Rajat for the pioneering individual he is and believing his knowledge and experience beyond the scope of controversy. He is a brilliant diagnostician and very professional. I hold high regard for him and would definitely recommend him to everyone.",2023-01-17 03:45:30,False,True,Satish Rai Chandra,,,

Although I got a temporary restoration for it, my smile has never been the same. Not only did this affect my smile but also my speech. I was recommended to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva’s clinic by a friend of mine.  After a long hiatus between my dental visits, I was apprehensive and very nervous but I can say that I had the best experience at Dr. Rajat’s clinic as he made me most comfortable and relaxed. He suggested me to go for an implant for my missing tooth, and based on my CBCT scans, it was the best option for me. So, I decided to choose a single dental implant. Since it was the front tooth and had significant effect on my smile, the dentist was extremely careful and meticulously planned the entire treatment. I was even shown the end-result and it looked very promising.  I was called in early on the day of surgery, and the entire procedure did not even take an hour. It was completely painless and minimally invasive. I was able to see the procedure as it was being done on the screen, and it was later given to me as my dental record. The attention to details and executing the treatment to perfection would definitely be the stand-outs of this clinic. The practice is very professional and compassionate at the same time. Throughout the process, everything was described in detail as to the road ahead, the timescale of all future visits, the costs which were spread over the whole dental treatment and the follow up visits and regular checking on all dental issues.  After the procedure, I was given a temporary restoration so that I wouldn’t be toothless. My final crown came a few weeks later and it fitted like a glove. The shape, size and color of the crown was just like my other tooth, and it perfectly blended in. My speech was also clearer, the lisp was gone and I finally had a clear diction. This was truly the best possible outcome that I expected to achieve with my implant.  Dr. Rajat’s clinic is truly a perfect place for getting your dental problems treated. They run an excellent, highly organized and exceptionally clean practice with top-notch facilities and technology. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.",2022-09-02 15:21:12,False,True,Suresh Kumar,,,

Dr. Rajat’s dental clinic in Ashok Vihar can be truly called a representation of painless dentistry. 
Owing to years of neglect and malfunction, I had ended up with a rather unpleasant smile. I had a few missing teeth and several of them were completely worn out. When I consulted Dr. Rajat with my issues, he was very supportive and motivated me to go for a full mouth smile makeover. Before we moved forward with my case, a CBCT scan was advised which revealed in-and-out of my teeth and jaws. Based on the interpretations of these scans, Dr. Rajat formulated the treatment plan; which consisted of many procedures which included rehabilitation of missing teeth, crowns and veneers for worn-out teeth and to fill the gaps between my upper front teeth. Most of teeth were decayed and had to be restored as well. 
As the treatment started, I was made quite comfortable and even the complex of the procedures like placement of implants were done effortlessly. In all my appointments, the chair time did not exceed for more than an hour and that just shows the expertise of your treating dentist. Emax and Zirconia crowns were fabricated using CAD CAM software and the value they added to my aesthetics was substantial. 
Several of my teeth were decayed, few of which needed root canal treatments. Lasers was used to eliminate the infection completely and quickly too. It was definitely reassuring to be able to watch the procedure done on your teeth, and Dr. Rajat made it possible by use of dental microscopes. I could actually see what exactly went in and came out of those tiny canals. The evolution of dentistry never ceased to amaze me. 
For the final touch, I underwent a teeth whitening procedure using Philips Zoom! equipment. It is a rather magical technique, for the results were eminent immediately. Overall, I can say that Dr. Rajat has worked wonders with my smile and I can only than him and his team for my newfound confidence. Not only that, my function has also improved considerably and I can now bite into my favorite foods without any fear of sensitivity or pain.

As a result, my teeth had completely lost its luster and became dull. I had tried a number of at home remedies for teeth whitening like lemon and vinegar but nothing worked much. When I finally decided to take a professional help, I started to search a good dentist near me. 
Dr. Sachdeva's Dental clinic had many positive reviews on Google and had carried out multiple successful whitening procedures. So I consulted him and he advised me zoom whitening. The most important thing that he warned me was that the procedure would be a success if only I followed post-operative instructions like no smoking for at least a month and no chromogemic beverages like tea or coffee for a week. It was good to understand the technique and its outcome before I finalize it. 
The procedure was rather simple and completely pain free. Once they apply the bleaching gel, it is activated using LED light-accelerated technology which almost instantly whitens your teeth. The process was repeated four times until I got the desired shade. The results are seen almost immediately and improves over the due course. I got about 5 shades brighter teeth on the very same day. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself. Dr. Rajat has done fantastic work with my teeth and I am really grateful for that. I was even provided with GC tooth mousse paste which helped rebuild the tooth structure lost to decay and would lessen the sensitivity. The entire experience at Dr. Rajat’s clinic was very positive and encouraging.

Dr Sachdeva's tireless efforts and hardwork coupled with commitment and dedication has culminated in his dental clinic at Ashok Vihar, being one of the best in the NCR in terms of services, timings, cleanliness, professionalism and quality. I happen to encounter an emergency a few days back when my father's tooth started giving him trouble and he was in unbearable pain. It was Holi and more so late in the night. I started to panic when all the clinics I knew close by were closed. It was then that I came to know about Dr Sachdeva's Dental clinic from one of my colleagues and I immediately rushed to his clinic.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see Dr. Rajat immediately attend my father. I took a sigh of relief when I finally saw my father relaxed and his pain was alleviated. It just took around 30-45 minutes of treatment and my father felt much much better.

Implants are just a logical step ahead after an extraction as a void in place of an extracted tooth can also cause other oral health issues. Whether or not a patient goes ahead with the suggested treatment is entirely upto them and we respect their decision. However, it is sad that u address my learned colleague as junior doctor. She is well qualified and skilled to perform the procedure that she did and would not be entrusted with our valued patients in case she wasn't.

Once he made me aware of it, I started noticing that I clench while I'm working on the computer and I wake up with a sore jaw (a sign I've been clenching through the night). He suggested Botox in the TMJ muscles but I was skeptical, I didn't want to change the look of my face. He listened to my concerns and told me about stretches and massages I could do at home. These helped but I was still having headaches so I decided to give Botox a try and I'm soooo glad that I did.
