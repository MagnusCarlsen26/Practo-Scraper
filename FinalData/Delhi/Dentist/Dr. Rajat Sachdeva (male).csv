"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"I am writing this testimonial to thank Dr. Rajat Sachdeva and I feel privileged to have benefitted from his services. For background, I had multiple amalgam fillings in my teeth that I had got done around 10 years back. It was until very late that I realized that these fillings contains mercury which can cause numerous side effects. 
I had been suffering from painful sores for the last few years, almost since the time I got these amalgam fillings. I never could understand the reason behind this and neither did my previous dentist. The sores were unrelenting and so painful that I wasn’t able to eat or even talk properly. No amount of antibiotics or painkillers would work and I had a constant burning sensation in my mouth. Fortunately, when one of my friends recommended Dr. Rajat Sachdeva’s clinic in Ashok Vihar, I immediately visited him. After a thorough examination and consultation, Dr. Rajat informed me that my mouth sores and ulcers were actually because of the amalgam fillings containing mercury. He suggested that we immediately remove these and replace them with non-metallic, biocompatible composite material. After my wilful consent, Dr. Rajat proceeded with the treatment and almost immediately, my sores disappeared and has not recurred ever since. 
SMART (Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Technique) was followed while strictly adhering to all the safety regulations. An amalgam separator was specially installed which was utilized to collect the mercury and the operating room was well-ventilated with a high-volume air filtration system. I was made to wear the protective gear including nasal masks, gowns and head cover. The entire team assisting the procedure including Dr. Rajat were well-protected too. A rubber was used to avoid any spillage and all the materials used were non-latex and sterile. The entire procedure was done with High speed evacuation and with utmost precision. Once the procedure was over, the operating team carefully eliminated and disposed mercury wastage while maintaining all the safety protocols. The level of professionalism seen was highly reassuring.
I am extremely thankful to Dr. Rajat for the pioneering individual he is and believing his knowledge and experience beyond the scope of controversy. He is a brilliant diagnostician and very professional. I hold high regard for him and would definitely recommend him to everyone.",2023-01-17 03:45:30,False,True,Satish Rai Chandra,,,

He suggested me to go for an implant for my missing tooth, and based on my CBCT scans, it was the best option for me. So, I decided to choose a single dental implant. Since it was the front tooth and had significant effect on my smile, the dentist was extremely careful and meticulously planned the entire treatment. I was even shown the end-result and it looked very promising.  I was called in early on the day of surgery, and the entire procedure did not even take an hour.

Owing to years of neglect and malfunction, I had ended up with a rather unpleasant smile. I had a few missing teeth and several of them were completely worn out. When I consulted Dr. Rajat with my issues, he was very supportive and motivated me to go for a full mouth smile makeover. Before we moved forward with my case, a CBCT scan was advised which revealed in-and-out of my teeth and jaws.

Most of teeth were decayed and had to be restored as well. 
As the treatment started, I was made quite comfortable and even the complex of the procedures like placement of implants were done effortlessly. In all my appointments, the chair time did not exceed for more than an hour and that just shows the expertise of your treating dentist. Emax and Zirconia crowns were fabricated using CAD CAM software and the value they added to my aesthetics was substantial.

It was definitely reassuring to be able to watch the procedure done on your teeth, and Dr. Rajat made it possible by use of dental microscopes. I could actually see what exactly went in and came out of those tiny canals. The evolution of dentistry never ceased to amaze me. 
For the final touch, I underwent a teeth whitening procedure using Philips Zoom! equipment. It is a rather magical technique, for the results were eminent immediately. Overall, I can say that Dr. Rajat has worked wonders with my smile and I can only than him and his team for my newfound confidence. Not only that, my function has also improved considerably and I can now bite into my favorite foods without any fear of sensitivity or pain.

Dr. Sachdeva's Dental clinic had many positive reviews on Google and had carried out multiple successful whitening procedures. So I consulted him and he advised me zoom whitening. The most important thing that he warned me was that the procedure would be a success if only I followed post-operative instructions like no smoking for at least a month and no chromogemic beverages like tea or coffee for a week. It was good to understand the technique and its outcome before I finalize it. 
The procedure was rather simple and completely pain free. Once they apply the bleaching gel, it is activated using LED light-accelerated technology which almost instantly whitens your teeth. The process was repeated four times until I got the desired shade. The results are seen almost immediately and improves over the due course. I got about 5 shades brighter teeth on the very same day. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself. Dr. Rajat has done fantastic work with my teeth and I am really grateful for that. I was even provided with GC tooth mousse paste which helped rebuild the tooth structure lost to decay and would lessen the sensitivity.

(I've got my braces on from here - Dr. Sachdevas Dental Aesthetic & Implant Center)
It's been a little more than 1 Year and a lot has been done on my teeth.

I'm still undergoing the process and it will be completed in next 2-3 months and thereafter I'll complete this review! 

First and most important thing ::
I've seen overall a tremendous improvement in my teeth alignment, positioning and their relocation, after getting braces !

Even though I was over age (31 Yrs), when I got my braces and chances were less for they will be as successful as they normally do (but I took a chance anyway) and Dr. Rajat Sachdeva and his team did a wonderful job by studying my case and their efforts made it happen.. 

My teeth structure which was once like deep snake bite, ladder like irregular structure has now transformed into a symmetric arch.

My braces are still ON and they will be removed after sometimes but I can definitely feel the difference, like improvement in facial features, Bite/chewing has become more natural and easy! To my surprise there is improvement in my speech also!

With that,
I had an RCT, and you know the childhood trauma of sitting on that dentist chair and those big injections! But Dr. Rajat Sachdeva is very friendly *** ****** ******* ******* that you'll not even know when the procedure has been done so easily by him! 
And even after 14 Months that RCT is going strong and I didn't face any problems in that after since.

I recommend people a regular checkup of their teeth, whenever/wherever possible! because I didn't even know that I had so many cavities which could all end up in RCTs but were timely filled and saved at this clinic!

Last but not least, 
A big thanks to the Orthodontist who has been working on my teeth since over a year!  
And a big thanks to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva under whom it has all become possible.

Will update soon when the whole procedure is done.
and now i can smile with my teeth out (Literally) :D !!

I called him prior visiting him and he, without any second thought called me to his office. My tooth was grossly decayed, an issue I had been ignoring for some time now. But one night, it suddenly flared up and the pain was unimaginable. It radiated to my ear and later, the entire side of my face was throbbing. As soon as I visited him, he started an IV line with analgesics. He was constantly by my side till the pain lessened and then an X-ray was taken, following which he decided to extract it. He performed the entire procedure with no difficulty and I was immediately relieved of the pain. I visited him the next day for follow-up and my wound had healed satisfactorily.

(I've got my braces on from here - Dr. Sachdevas Dental Aesthetic & Implant Center)
It's been a little more than 1 Year and a lot has been done on my teeth.

I'm still undergoing the process and it will be completed in next 2-3 months and thereafter I'll complete this review! 

First and most important thing ::
I've seen overall a tremendous improvement in my teeth alignment, positioning and their relocation, after getting braces !

Even though I was over age (31 Yrs), when I got my braces and chances were less for they will be as successful as they normally do (but I took a chance anyway) and Dr. Rajat Sachdeva and his team did a wonderful job by studying my case and their efforts made it happen.. 

My teeth structure which was once like deep snake bite, ladder like irregular structure has now transformed into a symmetric arch.

My braces are still ON and they will be removed after sometimes but I can definitely feel the difference, like improvement in facial features, Bite/chewing has become more natural and easy! To my surprise there is improvement in my speech also!

With that,
I had an RCT, and you know the childhood trauma of sitting on that dentist chair and those big injections! But Dr. Rajat Sachdeva is very friendly *** ****** ******* ******* that you'll not even know when the procedure has been done so easily by him! 
And even after 14 Months that RCT is going strong and I didn't face any problems in that after since.

I recommend people a regular checkup of their teeth, whenever/wherever possible! because I didn't even know that I had so many cavities which could all end up in RCTs but were timely filled and saved at this clinic!

Last but not least, 
A big thanks to the Orthodontist who has been working on my teeth since over a year!  
And a big thanks to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva under whom it has all become possible.

Will update soon when the whole procedure is done.
and now i can smile with my teeth out (Literally) :D !!

I called him prior visiting him and he, without any second thought called me to his office. My tooth was grossly decayed, an issue I had been ignoring for some time now. But one night, it suddenly flared up and the pain was unimaginable. It radiated to my ear and later, the entire side of my face was throbbing. As soon as I visited him, he started an IV line with analgesics. He was constantly by my side till the pain lessened and then an X-ray was taken, following which he decided to extract it. He performed the entire procedure with no difficulty and I was immediately relieved of the pain. I visited him the next day for follow-up and my wound had healed satisfactorily.

I started to panic when all the clinics I knew close by were closed. It was then that I came to know about Dr Sachdeva's Dental clinic from one of my colleagues and I immediately rushed to his clinic.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see Dr. Rajat immediately attend my father. I took a sigh of relief when I finally saw my father relaxed and his pain was alleviated. It just took around 30-45 minutes of treatment and my father felt much much better.

Implants are just a logical step ahead after an extraction as a void in place of an extracted tooth can also cause other oral health issues. Whether or not a patient goes ahead with the suggested treatment is entirely upto them and we respect their decision. However, it is sad that u address my learned colleague as junior doctor. She is well qualified and skilled to perform the procedure that she did and would not be entrusted with our valued patients in case she wasn't.
