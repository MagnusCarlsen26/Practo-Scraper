I also had a scaling done that left my teeth shiny. \n\nMy second appointment was a few days back. I got three tooth fillings done -- all absolutely painless and most importantly, I couldn't even tell where my real teeth ended and the fillings began!\n\nWhat I really loved was her easy-going nature and good humour which put me at ease and deleted my intense fear of dental work. She is also ready to answer all your questions patiently. The cherry on top: Her services come at a very reasonable cost!",

She then took an X-ray of my teeth and suggested an inlay, a unique kind of ceramic-based filling that she said would be the greatest choice for my particular set of teeth. My treatment was gentle and without pain. They provided me with excellent service, and I am grateful.",

Because of her amazing work, I would highly suggest her to everyone. and follow up reminders taken care of by the clinic staff and Dr herself.\n",

I had nothing to fear because everything went extremely smoothly. I was aware that I was in capable hands. The facility is quite welcoming, hygienic, and Dr. Deepa has a very steady hand. I have no discomfort or annoyance. She made every effortto restore my natural teeth by doing fillings rather than RCTs.
