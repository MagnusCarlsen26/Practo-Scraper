During Covid-19 I had to get my Mother\u2018s dental surgery done. She is senior citizen and during lockdown was difficult to get her admitted in the hospital for the treatment. She supported us exceptionally during difficult time. She made my mother comfortable through out the process. Most importantly followed complete safety guidelines as per the standards during Covid-19 without any compromise. I will strongly recommend to visit the clinic once without my hesitation and give a chance to serve. ",
