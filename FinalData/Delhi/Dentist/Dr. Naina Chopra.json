The receptionists extended a genuine welcome, and the dental assistants, with their patience and reassurance, transformed the visits into comforting journeys.

Then Dr. Chopra clinic is the right place for you to get it cured without any doubts..Reason is simple - the expertise & experience they have about their field is above perfection. The way they had patiently explained me the process of treatment and convinced me was helpful. I wish i could have come some years back so that i could have saved my mollar and easily avoided the tremendous pains I had suffered throughout..\nAnyways it's never too late and am really happy with the treatment received....thanks a tonnes to both the doctors and the team who had been on toes to make me really comfortable during the treatment..\nI never felt the pain during the entire process just because of 2 things, my faith in my \" loveable Hanuman \ud83d\ude4f and my both my wonderful and amazing Dr's Ashish ji and Naina mam\"\ud83d\udc4c\nNow I have been implanted a cap, did my RCT, got a tooth extracted and most importantly- Over came my fear of those instrument in my mouth \ud83d\ude04...\nI wish all my luck to the team for keeping up such good work.

The receptionists extended a genuine welcome, and the dental assistants, with their patience and reassurance, transformed the visits into comforting journeys.

Due to this I was always aware about the condition of my teeth & it helped me have enough confidence in the treatment. She is very friendly & tries to work according to the pain bearing capacity of the patient. My overall experience has been very good, I love how my teeth look now & I will surely recommend her to my friends & family.",
