"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"My Experience: Had fillings from here at first. I was so impressed with the result and the staffs that I continued with my tooth capping, extraction, etc. from here only.

Doctors and Staffs: Dr. Naina and Dr. Ashish are very kind and cooperative. They both helped me understand what the problems were and personally curated solutions, best for me, were offered to me to choose from. The assistants Rakhi and others too are very friendly, but very respectful at the same time, which finally enhanced the experience of the treatment.

Equipment and Clinic: The equipments are clean and sanitised after each patient’s treatment. They have created a good ambience of the clinic also where soft piano music from ‘River Flows In You’ by Yiruma to ‘Scientist’ by Coldplay are played in background, making the patient calm during the treatment.

Way Forward: Pretty sure my future dentist appointments are also going to be with them only as long as I’m in Delhi.
