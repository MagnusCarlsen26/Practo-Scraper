"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,NO,"I contacted the clinic for infection in third molar (wisdom tooth) as I wanted to get the tooth extracted. I was given an appointment and upon inquiring for charges I was told that Doctor will check first and then discuss the same. So I meet the doctor who works for Dr. Eisha Kathuria (name not mentioned on the prescription/letter head). Upon checking my 3 year old OPG(as this was my second extraction) I was told we are ready to remove the tooth. As this was my second, I was aware of the procedure so I asked the doctor why they are not going to treat the infection first as this is going to be invasive(surgical)? I was told that tooth can be removed now. I went for it as I could not bear the pain. Post the procedure, I was handed over a bill of 5200/-. When disputed as it was not communicated, Dr. Eisha was kind enough to give a discount of 1000/-.
This procedure was done in June or July 2016. Stitches were removed on time and I was told that recovery is good. For some reason post this procedure, I always felt discomfort in my lower jaw. I have woken up with a clenched jaw and all day everyday till date I feel discomfort. This was reported to the doctor. They did find tissue scarring but I have been telling them I don't feel blood circulation in the jaw. I have felt sudden blood rush in the jaw upon tapping my face which lead to nausea. I have to constantly maintain pout to relax my jaw. I was given some gel and other meds but the issue remains same. I have been exercising my jaw as prescribed but to no changes. I have never visited the doctor again as I will be taking a second opinion by my previous doctor once he's back in India and decide due course of action.

I personally feel that doctor's very important job is to treat as many patients as possible. He/She is considered next to God. 

Keeping charges on higher side you attract affluent people only. Even middle/upper middle class people may not afford to take your services.

My good wishes are there with you. Keep it up and try to serve the society at large.
