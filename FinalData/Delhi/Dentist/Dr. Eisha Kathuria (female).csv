Since you have already made your name/reputation in the locality, may like to reduce charges.

I personally feel that doctor's very important job is to treat as many patients as possible. He/She is considered next to God. 

Keeping charges on higher side you attract affluent people only. Even middle/upper middle class people may not afford to take your services.

My good wishes are there with you. Keep it up and try to serve the society at large.
