"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Dental Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I underwent dental treatment with Dr. Seema Kushwaha from September to November 2017. I had a cavity filled to begin with. She performed root canal on one of molars as well extraction of a wisdom tooth. I had a very good experience with my treatment. The root canal treatment was practically painless and so was the tooth extraction. The best part was that she is a highly proficient dental surgeon and procedures are quick. The patient feels comfortable. She is soft spoken and understands patients' concerns. She is also  honest in her assessment  and  diagnosis. My two teeth were giving me trouble for the  last two year. Now I am feeling comfortable. I will recommend to my fiends and relatives and will see her in future too, if need arises.
