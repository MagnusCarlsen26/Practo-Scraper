"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Orthodontic Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Anuja Agarwal is not only a dedicated doctor but also quite a friendly kind of a person. She has good communication skills along with an ability to form good rapport with her patients. Meeting her helps one to understand the proper meaning of professionalism. The best part about her is her ability to tackle even the most tricky case with utmost ease. Treatment with minimal trauma is another plus point about her. I would especially recommend her because of her professionalism, knowledge, ability to conduct pain-free treatment without lengthy appointments and good time management. Do visit her.",2019-09-15 18:42:48,False,True,Aarushi,,,
