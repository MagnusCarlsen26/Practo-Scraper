"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"
Sarika solanki is an excellent and very conscientious practitioner. When he is operating he is totally focussed on what he is doing. I went for a routine checkup yesterday which on this occasion included a scale and polish. During the procedure he discovered a filling had come adrift which she refilled during my ‚Äúcheckup‚Äù session.she is definitely the finest dental surgeon I have been involved with during my many years of treatment.
her whole practice is top rate, including his ancillary staff who are charming and efficient. Highly recommended. ",2019-11-18 04:18:17,False,True,Monica ,,,
