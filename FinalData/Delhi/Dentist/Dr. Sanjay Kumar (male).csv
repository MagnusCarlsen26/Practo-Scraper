None,None,0,0,YES,"I found Dr Kumar online after much research. I needed my dental crown replaced, and quickly since I'm only in the country for a short while. I was extremely satisfied with his service.

He was extremely thorough with my checkup, noting shortcomings in my initial root canal (from a different doctor) and making sure the root canal itself was fine. 
He recommended a very wide variety of options of crown replacements, and talked me through my options in language I could understand. 
He was very prompt in getting the crown replaced - new filling, fitting of the crown and the cleaning took only two sittings.
Throughout, he would explain each step of the process making sure I understood what was happening, and answered every random question I would come up with in the sessions with patience and precision.
He was very responsive to my body language and doubts, and went out of the way to make sure I was satisfied with his work.
Finally, he was very reasonable and up-front about the costs involved, and I had a clear idea of what each step would cost me from the get-go. 

My only hesitation was when I saw how unassuming his lab appeared, but don't let that fool you in the slightest. They've got (what my untrained eye finds to be) good equipment, and I now have a new crown, and a bar-coded card with a 10 year replacement warranty to keep me at ease.
