"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My mother was having dental pain from quite some months, but due to Covid fear we were avoiding visiting to hospitals or clinic. But when pain has become unbearable, we have started video consultation with Dr. Rudra and visited his clinic. With preliminary examination, RCT was suggested by him. The best part I have experience there is having team of expert consultants. Dr. Aditi was taking care of RCT for my mother, with rich experience and ease, she has done the entire process smoothly. Few things I would like call out about:
 - Dr Rudra and team treats and takes care of you like a family
 - Always reachable, rather himself follows up post treatment as well
 - Very transparent with cost of treatment, no hidden charges. In fact, I found the treatment very cost effective.
 - takes cares of Covid safety norms, clean and sanitised place.

I’m really thankful to Dr Rudra and Dr Aditi for such a wonderful experience during my mother’s RCT. Thanks!  ",2021-08-01 10:35:55,False,True,Rohit Bhoria ,,,
,,0,0,YES,"I really thank DR Rudra for helping in these situations as it was regarding my 80 yrs old father in law. He was having some problem with his teeth since last few days. At first he ignored it and took some pain killer s himself but after some time when they stopped working and conditions became worse he could not eat anything and then ask to go to hospital which we were trying to avoid.
I then jus called DR Rudra for advice and he over the call only listened everything very patiently and prescribed few medicines after checking the pics sent which helped my father in law very much and he was able to eat anything and felt better...
Thanks a lot....",2020-12-03 08:00:34,False,True,Kanika,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,","Periodontal Disease,",0,0,YES," I was told for surgery from one of the famous periodontist since I was skeptical and nervous for the surgery, I referred to Dr. Rudra mohan and he completely understood my concerns and its been 15 days with two visits , I have seen definite improvement, my gums bleeding has stopped, gum are no more sore and red. I am hopeful for more progress in the coming time. 
Dr. Rudra mohan is one of the best periodontist in Delhi, I have ever been to. He took care of his patients very well by regular follow ups, genuinely concerned about how his patients feeling Or making progress. He took all necessary covid precautions, vibes of the clinic is very pleasant and hygienic.
