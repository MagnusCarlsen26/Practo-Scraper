I was specifically looking for someone who was highly skilled and could minimize post-treatment pain. That's when I came across Dr. Manish Sharma, who, in my opinion, is a highly qualified and experienced professional.

Prior to Dr. Sharma, I had consulted with several dentists who recommended tooth extraction and sinus lift treatment. Others suggested full mouth rehabilitation. With all these conflicting recommendations, I was left confused and overwhelmed.

Fortunately, after two years of searching, I found Dr. Manish Sharma. He not only treated my severely decayed tooth without extraction but also suggested an alternative treatment plan that avoided sinus uplift surgery. This approach greatly appealed to me.

Throughout the treatment process, both during and after the procedures, I experienced no pain and swelling. I was incredibly pleased with the outcome and am grateful to have found Dr. Sharma.

In addition to his expertise, Dr. Sharma is also incredibly patient-centric. He took the time to explain the treatment plan thoroughly and address all my concerns. He also provided me with valuable advice on maintaining good oral hygiene.

My experience with Dr. Sharma was nothing short of divine. His expertise, patient-centric approach, and meticulous care made my dental treatment a seamless and comfortable experience. I am truly grateful for his guidance and the exceptional dental careÂ heÂ provided.
