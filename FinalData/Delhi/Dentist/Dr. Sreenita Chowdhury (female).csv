My son was suffering badly from teeth related issues. He was very scared and reluctant to go for any kind of tooth treatments. The only option left was to go for treatment along with anaesthesia, which was challenging, time taking and costly. We consulted online Dr Sreenita via Practo app. Dr Sreenita understood our problem very well and she assured for best treatment. She mingled with my son very well. She spent enough time convincing him that the procedure will be painless and smoother. Finally with loads of effort doctor won son’s confidence and treated him very well without anaesthesia. She addressed all painful areas, doctor brought my son’s life on track. We stay abroad and we had very limited time, she treated all major issues in very short span of time.
