A few years back, searching for a good doctor in the locality was a difficult task. 
Thanks to Practo, it has now become a smooth affair. When I was searching for a dentist on the app , I came across Dr. Pankaj Rao from Oraa Care Smile Dental Clinic whose reviews were positive. Getting impressed by those favourable reviews,  I decided to give her a visit for my gum bleeding problem. Even though I was skeptical about a dental visit during corona virus pandemic,  I visited her clinic and found it  well-managed. The staff ensured  that appointments are done in a manner that there is no rush in the reception area, the full body sanitisation, pulse and temperature  check were some of the key safety measures which were taken in the clinic. The  shoe caps were also provided to make sure that cleanliness is maintained inside the main clinic area. These measures impressed me largely on my first visit. After my first check up, I was advised a deep root cleaning and a deep root canal for one of my tooth. Until today,  I have had some four to five sittings with Dr. Pankaj and every single time she made my visit less scary. Because of her sophisticated subtle temperament with an excellent clinical expertise, I can visit her again if any tooth problem further persists.

She clearly explains the issue and treat patients accordingly. Last year, I got my mom in law treated by her when we used to live in Dwarka.

Recently, I again got my mother in law treated by Dr Rao. premolars and molars of my mom in law were in very bad condition due to pyorrhoea. Dr Rao treated my mom in law with great perfection, firstly Dr Rao got her RCT done which is actually painless and my mom did not take any pain killer after her RCT.After her RCT,  Dr Rao performed bridging of 4 teeth, that too again with perfection.

Dr Rao treats her patient's with so much patience, in my case my mom- in law was so comfortable and this gave us a strong reason to travel 40 kms from Vaishali Ghaziabad to Dwarka. Dr Rao is undoubtedly a one stop solution for any dental problem.

I wish Dr Rao in all her future endeavours!

Firstly I have visited for tooth filling for little bit decay in teeth then only doctor suggested me that my wisdom thooth has totally been decayed 
Then she suggested me for surgical extraction 

It almost take 4-8 weeks for overall healing so don't be panic...

Let me clear about before and after procedure you do t have to be penic doctor give anesthesia injection before process there fore we don't feel any sensation while the process and it almost take 40 - 45 mins for extraction .I haven't feel any discomfort or blood flowing too much and after a week we have to be in clinic for opening stitches it takes 4 - 5 mins and at last doctor suggested for Luke warm water split 2-3 times a day

So my overall experience here has been Great including staffs and doctor have such a warm gesture
and I haven't feel any type of discomfort in between the days....
And would suggest you to come to Oraa clinic once if you have any problem related to tooth.

"Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment, Tooth Extraction,",0,0,NO,Root canal treatment  for two teeth of mother was agreed at 15000 but ended up teeth extraction at 10000.,2021-09-14 16:03:10,False,False,Verified Patient,"First of all it was a rerct  case, your mother had got a very bad rct done at some clinic and then you came for rerct to us. The condition of teeth and success predicability had been informed to you as well your mother from the very first day. Because  of her dwelling previous problems the teeth pain didn't  subside in both teeth. 

If you are looking for predictable  results, plz visit  specialist  initially only, not after getting it treated for 4 months by some quack , spoiling it and then expect specialist to do miracles. We gave multiple attempts to save but due to previous bone problems  pain didnot subside and we advised extraction. 

Two teeth rerct and then surgical  extraction by oral and maxillofacial surgeon is justifiable.",2021-09-15T08:17:07+0000,Dr. Pankaj Rao
