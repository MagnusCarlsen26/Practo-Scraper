A few years back, searching for a good doctor in the locality was a difficult task. 
Thanks to Practo, it has now become a smooth affair. When I was searching for a dentist on the app , I came across Dr. Pankaj Rao from Oraa Care Smile Dental Clinic whose reviews were positive. Getting impressed by those favourable reviews,  I decided to give her a visit for my gum bleeding problem. Even though I was skeptical about a dental visit during corona virus pandemic,  I visited her clinic and found it  well-managed. The staff ensured  that appointments are done in a manner that there is no rush in the reception area, the full body sanitisation, pulse and temperature  check were some of the key safety measures which were taken in the clinic. The  shoe caps were also provided to make sure that cleanliness is maintained inside the main clinic area. These measures impressed me largely on my first visit. After my first check up, I was advised a deep root cleaning and a deep root canal for one of my tooth. Until today,  I have had some four to five sittings with Dr. Pankaj and every single time she made my visit less scary. Because of her sophisticated subtle temperament with an excellent clinical expertise, I can visit her again if any tooth problem further persists.

Unlike other doctors in the area, the cost of dental treatment is absolutely pocket-friendly. To conclude Oraa Care clinic will henceforth be my only choice for all my dental-related problems.",2020-10-02 16:04:49,False,True,Neha Singh Bist,,,

Yes ofcourse I said so, with stuff in my mouth she's asking me what I would like to be done with my tooth, without explaining anything, which a professional doctor does. 

After doing filling, then she's explaining (that too on my questioning) that you should have gone for RCT.

She should have explained the case first n should have guided me to the better treatment for me rather than putting words in my mouth n then blaming it all on me.

The visit to doctor itself is very pleasing; Dr Mrs Pankaj Rao makes the customer feel comfortable and resolves all the queries that might come to your mind.

So before I invest another 22k, I had visited Dr. Pankaj Rao for seeking a second opinion whether tooth implant is the only option left for me!! Or my tooth can be saved by RCT.
After thorough examining, Dr. Pankaj Rao assured me there is no need for tooth implant at this stage and my tooth can be easily saved, she explained the infection (i.e. cyst) was due to improper cleaning of roots and it’s not any major problem, so I decided to continue my further treatment by Dr. Pankaj Rao. I found her treatment at Oraa Care clinic was much advanced, modern, more hygenic then my previous treatment, even the charges (fees) were nominal.

She clearly explains the issue and treat patients accordingly. Last year, I got my mom in law treated by her when we used to live in Dwarka.

Recently, I again got my mother in law treated by Dr Rao. premolars and molars of my mom in law were in very bad condition due to pyorrhoea. Dr Rao treated my mom in law with great perfection, firstly Dr Rao got her RCT done which is actually painless and my mom did not take any pain killer after her RCT.After her RCT,  Dr Rao performed bridging of 4 teeth, that too again with perfection.

Dr Rao treats her patient's with so much patience, in my case my mom- in law was so comfortable and this gave us a strong reason to travel 40 kms from Vaishali Ghaziabad to Dwarka. Dr Rao is undoubtedly a one stop solution for any dental problem.

I wish Dr Rao in all her future endeavours!
