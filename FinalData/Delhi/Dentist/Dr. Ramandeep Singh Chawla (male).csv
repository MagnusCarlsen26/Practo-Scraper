"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I had 2 instances with the doctor. 

Unfortunately, 2 of my teeth were fractured hence need to replace both. The best part, the Doctor himself did the entire surgery. Second, he was quite patient while performing the surgery as well as answering all my queries. It's been a year now after my surgery and still he keeps checking whether I am doing fine.

My dad, who is 72+ years old, went for a permanent denture. Considering his age, he was quite reluctant and it wasn't easy for us to convince him. Surprisingly, after 1 meeting with the doctor, he just decided to go for the surgery which is a long one. Since I live abroad, the doctor was kind enough to arrange pick and drop for him. 

If you have any dental issue, look no further, please visit him and he will take care of the rest. Thank you doctor. Wishing you health and energy to help others. God bless!!
