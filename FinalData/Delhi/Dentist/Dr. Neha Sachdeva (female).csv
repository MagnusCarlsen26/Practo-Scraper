I don't know what and where was the communication gap. 
At the beginning of the treatment we explain all our patients the procedure, where specifically for scaling(professional cleaning of teeth); we convey it is charged per sitting ie ‚Çπ500 per sitting.

Number of sittings depends on the deposits in patient's mouth and a single sitting lasts approx 8-10 minutes.

Now why 8-10 minutes?? Depending upon the deposits( both amount and thickness) in patient's mouth, the piezoelectric scaler tip (instrument used to do scaling) gets heated up in 8-10 minutes. Hence we have to stop because the heated instrument can lead to sensitivity and further damage to your teeth.",2020-12-07T08:51:54+0000,Dr. Neha Sachdeva
