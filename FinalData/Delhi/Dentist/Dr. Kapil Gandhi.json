Since childhood, I have faced many issues; not being able to smile confidently, not being able to socialise very much, to name a few.\n\nDr. Gandhi has been with me every step of the way, expertly filling cavities, and making my teeth look aesthetically pleasing with the help of veneers and composite. His treatment gave me the much needed confidence that was so absent from my life.\n\nRecently I was suggested by him that it was finally time for a more permanent solution, crowns. So, we decided to go through with the treatment and it was the best decision I have ever made. He carried out the treatment with extreme precision and care, and now I have the best smile I could have ever asked for. I can laugh freely, I can smile freely, I can talk to anyone without subconsciously thinking that what would the other person think about my teeth. I will forever be grateful to him, and I truly believe that no other person could have done this good of a job.",

He explained the problem to me and ensured I first get out of the pain before we move to actual treatment-which was tooth extraction. On the day of the extraction, he worked with me very slowly, settling my anxieties and questions at first, then explaining each and every step, making the environment caring/less stressful and the job was done in few minutes. I am grateful to him. I must also mention the good staff he has who ensured cleanliness of the clinic, played music of my choice and kept a smile on their faces to relieve of my unnecessary tension.

I must mention here that in first meeting itself I felt so much satisfied with the way he dealt with my son with being very very polite and on the same time being a little disciplined so that he can forget his worries and feel safe in his hands. I have had 3 sittings till now with him for my son's dental cavities and caries and all have gone very very well. As I was asked by another doctor that my son will need to go through all the treatment in GA (General anesthesia), but then Dr. Gandhi **** ** ********* ** *** ******* said that no we need to have faith on child and decrease his anxiousness and slowly and steadily treat him in opd itself. Even the tooth, which another doc recommended to be extracted, Dr. Gandhi is trying to save that too with treatment. Also, every time he has answered my queries (being anxious for my child) so nicely and in elaborated manner, to make us feel completely satisfied parents. So all in all I am so much thankful to him for all his efforts with my child and way of his treatment.\n",

Being a diabetic I am overtly cautious when i lock in on medical decisions. Dr Gandhi had the maximum positive reviews for \"pediatric dentistry\" which comforted me with the fact that somebody who is gentle with kids would definitely be patient with me.\n\nAs this was my first dental consultation I did not know what to expect. But Dr. Gandhi and his team made the experience impeccably comfortable. I got my wisdom tooth extracted surgically. Dr Deepak from his team who operated on me was excellent, kept the procedure as minimally invasive as possible. No post operative bleeding, no nightmares like dry socket or infections (the horrific stories you find on youtube). His team religiously followed up with me, answered all my calls and were always available with patience. I am writting this on the 10th day since my procedure and should still be healing (being a diabetic) but I feel like I am all healed up. \n\nA big THANK YOU to Dental Masters.",

Since childhood, I have faced many issues; not being able to smile confidently, not being able to socialise very much, to name a few.\n\nDr. Gandhi has been with me every step of the way, expertly filling cavities, and making my teeth look aesthetically pleasing with the help of veneers and composite. His treatment gave me the much needed confidence that was so absent from my life.\n\nRecently I was suggested by him that it was finally time for a more permanent solution, crowns. So, we decided to go through with the treatment and it was the best decision I have ever made. He carried out the treatment with extreme precision and care, and now I have the best smile I could have ever asked for. I can laugh freely, I can smile freely, I can talk to anyone without subconsciously thinking that what would the other person think about my teeth. I will forever be grateful to him, and I truly believe that no other person could have done this good of a job.",

He explained the problem to me and ensured I first get out of the pain before we move to actual treatment-which was tooth extraction. On the day of the extraction, he worked with me very slowly, settling my anxieties and questions at first, then explaining each and every step, making the environment caring/less stressful and the job was done in few minutes. I am grateful to him. I must also mention the good staff he has who ensured cleanliness of the clinic, played music of my choice and kept a smile on their faces to relieve of my unnecessary tension. Thank you Dr Gandhi, I have a lot more work on my teeth to be done and I am sure going to go back to you. ",

I was really fearful about how my son is going to manage for his dental treatment as he was really anxious when I took him to other 2 doctors. But then through Practo I read and found about Dr. Kapil Gandhi's repute and I thought of consulting him for my son. I must mention here that in first meeting itself I felt so much satisfied with the way he dealt with my son with being very very polite and on the same time being a little disciplined so that he can forget his worries and feel safe in his hands. I have had 3 sittings till now with him for my son's dental cavities and caries and all have gone very very well. As I was asked by another doctor that my son will need to go through all the treatment in GA (General anesthesia), but then Dr. Gandhi **** ** ********* ** *** ******* said that no we need to have faith on child and decrease his anxiousness and slowly and steadily treat him in opd itself. Even the tooth, which another doc recommended to be extracted, Dr. Gandhi is trying to save that too with treatment. Also, every time he has answered my queries (being anxious for my child) so nicely and in elaborated manner, to make us feel completely satisfied parents. So all in all I am so much thankful to him for all his efforts with my child and way of his treatment.\n",

Being a diabetic I am overtly cautious when i lock in on medical decisions. Dr Gandhi had the maximum positive reviews for \"pediatric dentistry\" which comforted me with the fact that somebody who is gentle with kids would definitely be patient with me.\n\nAs this was my first dental consultation I did not know what to expect. But Dr. Gandhi and his team made the experience impeccably comfortable. I got my wisdom tooth extracted surgically. Dr Deepak from his team who operated on me was excellent, kept the procedure as minimally invasive as possible. No post operative bleeding, no nightmares like dry socket or infections (the horrific stories you find on youtube). His team religiously followed up with me, answered all my calls and were always available with patience. I am writting this on the 10th day since my procedure and should still be healing (being a diabetic) but I feel like I am all healed up. \n\nA big THANK YOU to Dental Masters.",

He was not eating properly and had constant pain, luckily we came to Dental Masters we did RCTs and other procedures as suggested. Everything was so transparent and with a perfect explanation. The most important thing was how my nephew became friends with everyone around. It was amazing to see how excited a 5 year old could be for his dental sessions. He just loved it here so much that now growing up he wants to become a Pediatric Dentist like Dr. Kapil sir. \ud83d\ude03 The staff here Saurav and Anjali are friendly and best part is they keep taking a follow up. They are not some overpriced fancy dental outlets but professional pocket friendly and concentrate on getting the job done with minimal pain and maximum treatment.",

My 5 year old son came in fearful and nervous, by the time he was to be worked on he was happy and confident that everything was going to be okay. Dr.Kapil Gandhi and his staff did an amazing job and were so kind and caring with my son during the whole process. He is exceedingly patient and creative in his approach with children. He takes time to explain what is going on and what needs to be done. I highly recommend this place, especially if you have little ones who are nervous about seeing the dentist. Thank you Dr. Kapil Gandhi for everything that you do for your patients!!",

We were pleasantly surprised to see her sitting through all the sittings for RCT. She didn't cry or make a huge fuss. All thanks to the doctor and his team. \nHe is patient in explaining about the procedure, and doesn't rushes through the appointment.\nWould highly recommend; the prices are quite reasonable too.\n",

Due to some unknown reasons (never saw chocolates and sweets prior to that), he has developed caries. However, can't thank God enough that we came across Dr. Gandhi through online research. He is true blend of theory and practice. He goes by the book. He could command Reyansh and make him sit on the dental chair by his own. But Reyansh didn't allow him to do the process completely and he recommended GA. He explained the whole process very patiently and recommended an anesthesiologists , who is also very experienced and very friendly. Dr Gandhi possess advance tools which make the whole process very easy and stress free. Last but not the least , Dr Gandhi also has very good team, who are very child friendly and handle kids nicely. My son, who is otherwise difficult to handle, has developed friendship not only with Dr. Gandhi but also his team. Thank u Sir.",

Dentists had been suggesting that he would have to go under general anaesthesia for all his treatments.i had almost given up when my regualar orthodontist whom i had been consulting for years suggested that i should take him to Dr. Kapil Gandhi, A Pediatric Dentist. The first visit at Dental Masters was amazing, Kushagra started off with crying and running away but soon Dr. Gandhi was able to calm him down and make him cooperate. Dr. Gandhi is very professional, kind and approachable. He is outstanding in handling kids especially those who are unwilling to cooperate. My son is almost done with all his treatments now n we are very happy n satisfied with all the services received. My sincere thanks to Dr. Gandhi for being so patient with kushagra and helping him overcome his fears ",

I was quite sceptical about the overall treatment initially as mine daughter is small but the way Dr. Kapil handled her was excellent . Though our treatment went across multiple sittings as it involved 2 root canals as well as around 3 fillings however we never felt uneasy in any of sittings . His support staff is also very good & helpful . They always made mine daughter comfortable .\nOverall we as parents would strongly recommend Dr. Kapil Gandhi's ( Dental masters ) clinic for treatment of kids. \nThankyou so much!!\n\n",
