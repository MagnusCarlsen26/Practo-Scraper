"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Straightening Teeth (Conventional Braces),",0,0,YES,I recently completed my orthodontic treatment with Dr Inderpreet Singh. The entire process was smooth and well-coordinated. Time was taken to precisely explain the details of the treatment. The transparency and attention made me feel as confident of my smile as I am of my teeth today.  The entire team remained friendly and open till the end of the process. Highly recommend!,2024-05-18 16:19:44,False,True,Sanvi Kaur,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I went to the doctor in a very painful situation.
Though there was a long que of waiting because of the covid and lock down.. still he managed to have my diagnosis done.
So in the first go he advised me to have mild anti-biotic medicines.
My second visit he started the treatment.
And in my 3rd visit it was all done.

He treated me very well and not a single touch of pain.
I was so scared to get it done but Dr Inderpreet didn't even made me feel any pain.

I am so relaxed now and would highly recommend him to my family and friends.

100% Satisfied Patient.

,"Dental Cleaning,",0,0,NO,Doctor was super polite when we booked an appointment for my 4 year old. He was super sweet when we visited . He suggested root canal and operated on my daughter. We went back after 3 days for treatment completion and he quickly became super horrible. Snapped and was rude. He left her in that condition.the hospital asked us to go away and never even bothered to  call us. Not sure if it's even ethical to leave a treatment mid way. Never take ur kid to a dentist - they will be friendly till they lay hands on money. I regret not taking mine to Paderiatic dentist. Eventually * **** ****** helped me out,2022-02-19 05:33:40,False,False,Jaya Amit Aggarwal,,,
