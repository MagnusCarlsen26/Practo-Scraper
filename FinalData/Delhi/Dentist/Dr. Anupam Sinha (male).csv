"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I don't normally write any review for any doctor on any public forum, however this experience of mine with Dr. Anupam Sinha calls for one. Though the doctor was very friendly, I had some issues with the way I was treated. 

I visited Dr. Natalia for the first time in this clinic because of some recurring pain in one of my pre-molars. On diagnosis, she advised me to get RCT done. The next time I came after taking her appointment on Practo, I was seen by Dr. Anupam. Though he was not the doctor that I had intended to be treated by (since I had talked to Dr Natalia), I did not object and went ahead with him. 

The first sitting went quite well, almost painless. However, the second sitting was a NIGHTMARE. I was already having slight pain and had informed Dr Anupam about it before the procedure itself. He straight away started with his thing and in spite of telling him MULTIPLE times during the procedure about the pain, that kept aggravating, he did very little to subside it. I could feel some resistance from his side in giving me proper local anaesthesia, for reasons that I am not aware of and are obviously, beyond my reasoning. Orion advertises ""painless RCT"" in their prescriptions, but this sitting was completely opposite. That night I had unbearable pain in that tooth and had to take THREE pain killers to sleep - Ketrorl, Enzoflam and Ultracet.

After getting a tooth-dressing done by him again the next day, I met him for the fourth and the last time after a gap of 5-6 days. To my surprise, this again was a NIGHTMARE, ****** *** ** ***** ************ ** *** ******* Needless to state, I felt quite some pain during the whole procedure, however, the icing on the cake was when the doctor BURNT my lower lip with a heated needle.

The second time when he burnt my lip, I had to shove his hand off and then tell him that he had burnt my lower lip, and it was NOT the pain in my tooth, but the BURN that I had been screaming out loud for.

On completion, he put some Vaseline on the lip and told me that the RCT is done. He had taken 5k from me *** **** ****** **** without the cap (which I was not even told by him that it has to be ultimately put).

Had a very bad experience with this doctor, will never recommend him to anyone. I had gone to Orion, thinking that it was in GK1 and had good ratings, *** ** *** ******* *** * ******* ****** **** ** ********* *******",2020-12-22 14:33:43,False,False,Luckshya,"Dear sir ,
You did in fact make an appointment with Dr Natalia and you were met by her and asked to start root canal treatment . You wanted time to think about it. Sunsequently after a few days when you did get in touch to start treatment dr Natalia had some personal work and asked you if you were ok getting treatment done with another dr before you came for the appointment .It was after your telephonic consent before coming for the appointment that Dr Anupam was assigned for your work.The charges for the root canal was explained to you before starting as Rs 5000 by dr Natalia .. Sometimes during endodontic treatment a flare up can occur especially as it did in you case and as you called up late in the night complaining of pain which wasn't subsiding with regular pain killers and so a more effective one was prescribed so that you could have a restful sleep and you were called for a check up early next morning. Subsequent to this episode the rct was compleated well over the next 2 visits.I hope you understand that due to the Corona virus doctors have to work with a variety of PPE to prevent cross infection . Dr anupam was using a hot instrument in your tooth and it touched your lip inadvertently while working in your mouth with all the PPE and mask. He did apologize for that . It was not intentional . 
Subsequent to the completion of the rct you informed us 3 days later that your tooth was now doing well and had healed and you were ready to make an appointment for the crown. You asked about our crown charges and were again  informed of the charges 7500 rs. After this you decided to write us a bad review. You never communicated your disappointments to us. Charge for the crown after paying for the root canal is normal . We  assure you that these rates are quite standard for the said procedures anywhere in South delhi.
We are sorry that you had an unpleasant experience with your dental procedure we would endeavour to improve our services further. ",2021-01-05T15:23:59+0000,Dr. Anupam Sinha

After pondering over it for a very long time i have decided to respond to your review. I did not deem it correct to do this over a public forum, but every time I go through it, it bothers me. You left a few facts out which I would like to bring to your notice again. 
1) You were getting treatment done somewhere else and transferred midway because you said your treatment was not going progressing well and was not getting finished even though it was more than  a year and a half 
2) You were quoted the treatment cost at the beginning of the treatment cost and all charges were explained and no extra money was charged to you over and above the said quoted amount. 
3 ) We finished your treatment in the time frame set for you as you were supposed to relocate to Canada/U.S  . 
4) The only problem we had was that you wanted me to reduce the size of your teeth and bring them closer together which was not a healthy option and you were informed about the same. You offered us more money to do that but I refused it was not the healthy option as per my education and experience.
 You were told by me that money is not the driving force and that it was unhealthy. You would always sit in the dental chair and argue with me asking the same thing over and over that why your teeth cannot be shaved parallel and the teeth bought close together. 
You were told that if you want that done you will need to go to some other dentist but you would come and sit outside my clinic crying and saying you do not want to go to anyone else as you want to get treatment done here.
5)  You started coming here to the clinic without making appointment and expecting to be seen . 
6) You started to whatsapp me on the phone and expected me to answer attend to your queries even late in the night when I could not you started getting upset with me . 
7) After your treatment was over you started coming to the clinic asking me to continue the treatment which was not needed.  
8) You choose to get a fixed retainer which needs to be cleaned regularly. If not brushed properly it leads to gum inflammation. In such instances the gum can get inflamed and grow over the retainer. 
9) Your treatment was completed to the best standards. 
I know that it’s not humanly possible to please all patients although we strive to do that. Sometimes we cannot do it because some patients do not understand that there is a difference between a doctor and other areas where customer is king and you do as the customer asks you to do. A doctor cannot always do what you want done as in the long run it may not be the healthy option. I would also like to state that you were never taken advantage of in anyway whether monetarily or otherwise. In fact we feel quite let down by your response.",2018-09-08T06:39:28+0000,Dr. Anupam Sinha

None,None,0,0,YES,I recently got deep cleaning of my teeth and gums from Doctor Anupam. I have a phobia of dentists but Dr Anupam has a very gentle hand. He keeps reassuring me during the procedure. He stopped when I asked him to and generally made me very comfortable in the dental chair. I have visited other dentists abroad including the USA and EU but have yet to experience such personalised attention anywhere. The clinic is well equipped and I would like to make a special mention of the anesthesia process that they give here. Dr Anupam uses a special anaesthesia delivery system that makes the process absolutely painless. one does not even feel the injection. The ambience of his clinic is very relaxing. I would recommend him highly for dental treatment. ,2017-05-19 08:33:50,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
