This had gradually worsened over time till I decided to see someone for it. I went to 2-3 doctors before I finally met Dr. Ruchir Mishra first at his South Ex clinic and then later at this new clinic. His understanding of such conditions is superb and he is extremely patient with his patients. He also believes in very conservative treatment methods to start with rather than advising expensive tests and procedures straight away. His stepwise approach in solving my problem and the continuous encouragement through the difficult 5-6 months went a very long way in finally giving me the much awaited relief. I then went onto take more treatment from his wife Dr. Sony who was also very good. Today, as I complete my treatment with Dr. Ruchir , I only have very good things to say about him for helping me recover from a very depressing phase on my life and I recommend him and his team to all those who look forward to evidence based methodical treatment at very reasonable prices. God bless Doc!",

But when the problem recurred, he removed it for me very painlessly and I felt comfortable during the procedure as well as after it. Thereafter I also got a missing molar replaced by him with a dental implant and a cap. Everything has gone very well for me and I am very satisfied with both his approach to his patients as well as his treatment planning and performance of the procedures.

Excellent Doctor !!! \n.So glad that I met him as he never failed to explain the details of each step of the treatment ,ensuring that I fully understand well and is confident of the treatment undertaken .\nThough i was  initially scared of the Periapical Surgery that I had to go through , his words of comfort ,his skills and knowledge to the finest detail and his clear explaination made me confident .. I knew that I was in safe hands ! Would definitely recommend to visit him as he is one of the finest doctors . Never had such experience here in my hometown in Imphal , Manipur nor in other parts of Delhi ! \n",

This had gradually worsened over time till I decided to see someone for it. I went to 2-3 doctors before I finally met Dr. Ruchir Mishra first at his South Ex clinic and then later at this new clinic. His understanding of such conditions is superb and he is extremely patient with his patients. He also believes in very conservative treatment methods to start with rather than advising expensive tests and procedures straight away. His stepwise approach in solving my problem and the continuous encouragement through the difficult 5-6 months went a very long way in finally giving me the much awaited relief. I then went onto take more treatment from his wife Dr. Sony who was also very good. Today, as I complete my treatment with Dr. Ruchir , I only have very good things to say about him for helping me recover from a very depressing phase on my life and I recommend him and his team to all those who look forward to evidence based methodical treatment at very reasonable prices.

He first did a gum treatment there which kept things fine for more than a year. But when the problem recurred, he removed it for me very painlessly and I felt comfortable during the procedure as well as after it. Thereafter I also got a missing molar replaced by him with a dental implant and a cap. Everything has gone very well for me and I am very satisfied with both his approach to his patients as well as his treatment planning and performance of the procedures. Would happily recommend him and his team including Dr. Sony and others.",

I had found out about Dr. Sony through the internet when searching for a nice Cosmetic Dentist in Delhi for my smile correction. While visiting her I also discussed my missing tooth problem with Dr. Ruchir who told me all the possibilities. After much thought I decided to go ahead with dental implants and Dr. Ruchir did a very smooth and painless job. His treatment planning is elaborate but such doctors who are very methodical always make patients feel reassured and give us a lot of peace of mind. I am very happy to recommend him.",

One doctor also suggested a lot of elaborate stuff to treat my joint and the treatment estimate was very expensive. Then I found out about Dr Ruchir and came to see him. He listened to me patiently and examined me properly. He suggested removing an upper wisdom tooth and some simple follow up things. He explained the reasons for his suggestions in detail. I was a little apprehensive since he was the first one to suggest removal for the upper one. But I must say all his plans turned out correct. Within 2 days of the removal, I started feeling relief and after a week he started me on some exercise and a splint. It has been almost 2 weeks now and I am almost 95% relieved of my pain and jaw movement problems now. Very thankful to Dr. Ruchir and his wife Dr Sony for their care as also their precise treatment plans *** ***** *******",

The removal was done absolutely pain free which came as a surprise, there was post procedural discomfort which I was warned about and  that was taken care with the help of medicines. He prescribed me excersices for my jaws and now I am perfectly normal. More than satisfied here at Smilekraft. Thank you keep up the good work.",
