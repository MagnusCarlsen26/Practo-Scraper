I started experiencing immense pain on the very next day. Called him multiple times and messaged him thereafter. He did not respond at all. He just suggested a pain killer and asked me to come again after 5 days. I insisted if i could see me in a day or two to get rid of the pain and to reassure is re- rct was required.

",2022-01-30 15:34:46,False,False,Abhinav Kalra,"I would like to clarify a few things here , Mr Kalra
1. You came to me with a complaint of swollen gums wrt a tooth- on examination I saw food lodgment as a cause for the swelling and the X-ray taken showed decay below the crown of an already root canal treated tooth. The treatment was discussed at length and the following was suggested- remove the old crown , remove the decay, fill the tooth and then take measurements for a new crown which would have good contact with the adjacent tooth and hence no food lodgment and hence no swelling in the gums. 
2. The next appointment was scheduled on the next working day of the clinic and the above mentioned treatment was carried out and an appointment fixed for crown cementation. I disagree with your observation that a temporary filling was done- the filling done was a composite filling which is a permanent one!
3. I usually do NOT take calls when I am treating a patient but I do msg them as and when I get free(as I did in your case).
4. You msgd me on Thursday and wanted me to see you on the same day but I replied that I would see you as scheduled  on Friday ( as Thursday the clinic is closed!)- and NOT in a day or two as you have wrongly written in your feedback! 
5. Lastly, the amount was charged as the filling was done and the crown was fabricated and at NO POINT did you tell me NOT to go ahead with the crown work. The decision to take 2nd/3rd opinion is entirely yours n  I wish you the best in the future 👍
