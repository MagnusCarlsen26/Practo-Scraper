Well to elaborate my lifetime experience I would start with a big hug and thanks to whole team of Dr Sourabh Nagpal and bow to acknowledge there hard work and understanding while treating me. I know doctor I was a hard patient to treat on but trust me back home my dentist in California used to just avoid treating me thereby making me further suffer and I was all through paranoid with dentists. Thanks for making the difference.
I mean it really worked so well here that I can't thank you so easily. At one time in my life I thought I would die of dental problems as I was on medicines heavily and never use to be able to cooperate with my dentist. 

Being a frequent traveller I can say I have been to more dentists than restaurants in my life. Out of list of 27 dentists(according to list with my secretary from 15 countries )All used to blame me as a bad patient.
I was reffered to your clinic by concierge of Hotel ITC Maurya (probably well known hotel in new delhi). The person at help desk was so sure about you that he said that's one of the best thing he can offer me in New Delhi.
My wife specially flew from The United States once she came to know that my treatment is going on with you people as it was unbelievable thing for her. She supported me in making it worth and Shaped it to suit me. 
In the end I would surely like to thanks your wife Dr Poonam Nagpal as most competent lady dentist I came across. Never in hurry but always makes thing according to patient on chair. I still remember I took good long hours just to take my first anaesthesia from her but that changed me totally and turned me cooperative. 
Honestly your dental office is at par with standards(what I was able to see) of clinic in States, just the difference is that dentists out there act very pricey and you people behave very humble which is important  and is probably your best quality. 
I promise to do best of arrangements for you if you plan to visit us in Beverly Hills anytime. ",2016-11-05 08:11:54,False,True,Lars,,,
None,"Dental Implant Fixing,Crowns and Bridges Fixing,Dental Fillings,Artificial Teeth,",0,0,YES,"Dr Nagpal's profile was shortlisted along with 3 more dentists as best available in Delhi by my sister residing in Delhi for my treatment as I specially dripped in from united states to get my treatment done as I very well know and understand that India is none less than anyone in cricket and in dentistry. For these obvious reasons I thought that I can couple my family trip with opportunity to get my Dental problems fixed. Indeed I ended up selecting Dr Sourabh for my treatment and in long run today i feel it was a beautiful decision. 
* Very good and updated clinic.
*Dentist was able to converse with my routine dentist in states and was infact able to convince him for his decision for treatment. Though my family dentist is far more older than Dr Nagpal, but he acknowledged that I am in safe hands as work once evaluated after completion was flawless.
* During my treatment appointment I came across patients of various nationalities, atleast 14-16 who were utterly satsified on previous occasions and were regular patients at Matrix clinic. This further gave me confidence,as for me Dr Sourabh was very young.
*My motive was to get good friendly treatment as overtime I felt that my dentist in Chicago was over charging unnecessarily and was still not giving sufficient time and attention too,probably bcoz of over occupancy. But I wasn't in any crisis situation while being on Dr Nagpal's dental office. Infact I was more comfortable than ever.
*Brands of implants and materials were used as per my satisfaction and I opted for best availables.
*Punctuality in completing and committing appointments was very impressive as even after some bottle necks doc was able to complete my treatment in time frame as was committed.
*Cost structuring was quite transparent as same was discussed in email too and was on website clearly displayed.
*All in total I was able to get best and according to my satisfaction. 
*My recommendation for Dr Sourabh Nagpal  is based on my personal experience, follow up of months and a complete check up by my specialist back home. So that's make me feel that my views can be of help to other patients of Dr Nagpal.

None,"Laminates,Smile Designing,",0,0,YES,Motive to write this review is that someone reading this review shall get a good idea of my first hand experience of getting treatment from Dr Sourabh Nagpal. I must say he is artist scientifically designing smiles. I atleast saw around 10-12 patients walking out with a all together new smile. Initially I was reluctant but when I met so many happy females of my age group I somehow got convinced but was scared till last appointment but more or less it was as if something was destined and Dr NAGPAL was well aware of what results can be attained. So it was his skill which made all this possible. You will hardly find anybody who got such a treatment done but it was nice that I got good smile that too without braces and best thing I liked was that doc gave me smile exactly resembling the pic that I showed him from a magazine. All in all I am delighted and excited and all credits and salutes to this marvelous dentist couple Dr Sourabh Nagpal and Dr Poonam Nagpal. To get such a thing before your wedding photography is a dream for every gal like me but doc made it true and easy for me. #SmileDesign at its best I would quote.,2016-02-16 07:24:50,False,True,User,,,

He is also not very transparent about the charges either. Now you will ask how much you will have to dish out for that and he will display a chart that says an X amount. And you will think that's how much I am spending for it. But wait, that's only the token amount. He will keep bringing additional charges for various stages of the root canal process. For instance after 3 visits, he will say something like"" now i will have to insert a fiber support to strengthen your teeth. That will cost an additional 6K or something"". If that was a part of the root canal process that should already have been included in the bill amount.

Anyways, now is the time for crowning. Either you opt for a metallic crown or a ceramic. I opted for the ceramic one with a 5 years warranty. But when it was time for me to get the crown fitted, he said ""the 5 year cover has recently become invalid so I have made the 10 year plan for you. This will cost you 3K extra"". I didn't make much of a fuss about it back then because it was already at the back of my mind to go for the years plan. But still I felt like he should have at least given me a prior update and taken my consent before going ahead with the new plan. What if I wasn't willing to dish away the additional charges? 

Now after almost 3 months I still feel although very minimal but still some kind of a sensitivity in my crowning area. I also opted for deep cleaning. Even here he chose to give a miss to those areas where it's not visible. And now as I got a reminder from Matrix Dental Clinic via Practo for a routine/follow up check I decided to review the place and inform that I don't know about others but ""I am finding another dentist for my future visits"". 

I am still giving it a 2 rather than 1 star because the receptionist was a

My treatment of Full Mouth Dental implant with Zirconia caps is surely a turning point in my life. It has definitely changed the way I look,speak, eat and smile. I was suffering from tooth problem since my childhood and by the age of 40 I was in bad shape. Though such a condition is common in Riyadh but I wanted better life and searched on net about different places in world to get good dental treatment. Places shortlisted included Dr Nagpal's place also in New Delhi India. After my enquiry one translator was arranged to interact with me from a good university who served great. I came to India twice for first stage and second stage at a gap of around 5 months. 
Treatment I opted was All on Four Dental Implants 

In my first visit all teeth were removed and replaced with implants and temporary teeth over it. Surgery went comfortably and gave me ease of eating though appearance was just ok.
In my second visit temporary teeth were replaced with permanent Zirconia teeth. Helped me in getting my dream Hollywood Smile.

All my treatment is ok and satisfactory. Dr Nagpal is not only good implanologist but also very understanding and caring. I wish all doctors treat there patients like Dr Sourabh Nagpal.
