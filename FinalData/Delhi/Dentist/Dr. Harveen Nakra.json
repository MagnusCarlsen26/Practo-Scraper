The moment you enter the clinic , it is pristine. All proper safety, hygiene and sterilisation protocols are followed. With a short wait the doctor greets you with a smile , and really understands the problem. She listens patiently and tweaks the treatment to your best need while being empathetic and comforting. Very polite, positive attitude and a friendly smile. Not only that , she is very skilled and pain was almost zero during the procedure. During multiple visits there were times when i got busy and could not make the appointment. Doctor was very understanding and promptly rescheduled my dates saying it was No Problem. ***** **** *** **** ******* ** ****** Because i had such a wonderful service I would highly recommend Dr Harveen to everyone. My parents would be visiting her soon for their treatment. I trust her completely. \n\n#notApaidReview\n#bestdentist@delhi",

(Dr. Harveen)\nThank you to all three docs - Dr. Tavleen, Dr. Deepak & Dr. Harveen (from Dental World, Punjabi Bagh) for making each experience of mine, a positive one.\nI'd been a regular patient of Dr. Tavleen & she always made me very comfortable & relaxed before doing any procedure. Last year one of my molars needed major surgery as some other dentist had left a prick of a needle while doing RCT & over time it had turned bad. Thus Dr. Deepak had to take over and it was a tedious two-hour-long surgery but again a fab job done by him. \nI was always all praises for Dr. Tavleen & Dr. Deepak till the time I got my RCT done by Dr. Harveen. \nI'm not an easy patient. Rather I'm the sort who can scare the doctors cause I'm over-jittery & nervous during any procedure. \nThanks to Dr. Harveen, we could accomplish two RCTs in less than a week's time. In fact, I fell asleep during my first RCT which was a rare occurrence even for the doctor. But Dr. Harveen was so smooth & deft with her work that I just didn't feel even a wee bit of uneasiness or discomfort and both times she finished the entire process in just one sitting. (Unbelievable, right!) \nDoc, you are the reason for the massive smile I am wearing right now. Thank you for being ever so patient, tolerant, and thoughtful. For checking on me, messaging me, post-procedure. The whole experience was tremendously positive and painless.",

The moment you enter the clinic , it is pristine. All proper safety, hygiene and sterilisation protocols are followed. With a short wait the doctor greets you with a smile , and really understands the problem. She listens patiently and tweaks the treatment to your best need while being empathetic and comforting. Very polite, positive attitude and a friendly smile. Not only that , she is very skilled and pain was almost zero during the procedure. During multiple visits there were times when i got busy and could not make the appointment. Doctor was very understanding and promptly rescheduled my dates saying it was No Problem. ***** **** *** **** ******* ** ****** Because i had such a wonderful service I would highly recommend Dr Harveen to everyone. My parents would be visiting her soon for their treatment. I trust her completely. \n\n#notApaidReview\n#bestdentist@delhi",

After mu RCT treatment, she is my go to doctor for any sort of dental issues.\nA smile begins here!!\n",

(Dr. Harveen)\nThank you to all three docs - Dr. Tavleen, Dr. Deepak & Dr. Harveen (from Dental World, Punjabi Bagh) for making each experience of mine, a positive one.\nI'd been a regular patient of Dr. Tavleen & she always made me very comfortable & relaxed before doing any procedure. Last year one of my molars needed major surgery as some other dentist had left a prick of a needle while doing RCT & over time it had turned bad. Thus Dr. Deepak had to take over and it was a tedious two-hour-long surgery but again a fab job done by him. \nI was always all praises for Dr. Tavleen & Dr. Deepak till the time I got my RCT done by Dr. Harveen. \nI'm not an easy patient. Rather I'm the sort who can scare the doctors cause I'm over-jittery & nervous during any procedure. \nThanks to Dr. Harveen, we could accomplish two RCTs in less than a week's time. In fact, I fell asleep during my first RCT which was a rare occurrence even for the doctor. But Dr. Harveen was so smooth & deft with her work that I just didn't feel even a wee bit of uneasiness or discomfort and both times she finished the entire process in just one sitting. (Unbelievable, right!) \nDoc, you are the reason for the massive smile I am wearing right now. Thank you for being ever so patient, tolerant, and thoughtful. For checking on me, messaging me, post-procedure. The whole experience was tremendously positive and painless.",

She use to answer every call and reply to every whatsapp message. I have never seen any doctor having such commitment. I highly recommend Dr Harveen ma'am and team to consult and get rid off pain and issue related to teeth and have a comfortable and painless experience. ",

Dr. Harveen is my daughter's friend's  mom and when I got to know that she is a dentist so i thought let me take advise from her also. I went there and my first impression was that i didn't wait for more than 5 min. Most important she suggested me just a pulp capping instead of painful and long procedure of Root Canal Treatment. Till date that tooth is perfectly fine. From that day my trust factor developed. \n\nThen she did my sister's veneering work 2 years back which all doctors said different treatment. Dr. Harveen's Treatment was so economical and best. Till now her tooth is shining\u2b50\u2728 with her beautiful smile. \n\nHer advice is so so genuine and valuable. Her utmost priority is customer satisfaction. So my whole family, relatives, friends go there for any of their dental treatment. They go there and borrow my blind trust and they come back with full satisfaction.I blindly trust on her Treatment and Advise\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThank you Dr. Harveen for saving my tooth and giving me my smile back\ud83d\ude01. May God bless you\ud83d\ude0a",

Everything is very well organised and neat and clean. Doctors here are very friendly and listen to your problems very patiently. I got my Dental Fillings  and teeth whitening done at Dental World clinic by Dr Harveen Nakra and those are up to the mark. You will be surprised to see their infrastructure. Their charges are also very reasonable according to the services they are providing. Everything is very nicely done. I will also like to thank Dr Deepak Nakra to be very patient with me as I was very much scared of the treatment and did many tantrums. I had an experience of lifetime with this clinic. I will advise everyone to visit this place for your dental treatment. I think these type of clinics are a boon for our area ( Punjabi Bagh and neighbouring areas). Thank you once again and all the best for everything.",

They ensured that my valuable time is not wasted in calling/visiting them multiple times. I got value-for-money and have referred others also, who have felt happy about the consult/treatment here.

After getting an X-ray done, we realised that the wisdom tooth had been lying down horizontally inside the gum. Honestly speaking, for one year, we consulted the top most dentists in Delhi-NCR and all of them had only one conclusion for my dental issue - which was the extraction of that underlying tooth. We consulted Dr Deepak and Dr Harveen Nakra for the same. These two doctors were the only ones who were completely against the extraction of the tooth and wanted to save it, realising the importance of the tooth (for future). The treatment went on for nearly 2 and a half years. Dr. Deepak and Dr. Harveen were actually the special ones whom we could (can) blindly trust on. My expression of gratitude is all what these two deserve.",

I just don\u2019t have to worry at all that I\u2019m taking my son Ranveer, who is 7 years old, to a Dentist. He is become so friendly with her. We started going to Doc Harveen when Ranveer got a small cavity. It\u2019s been more the 4 years that we go regularly for six monthly checkup\u2019s for maintaining good oral hygiene. Handling small kids is a tough job. They get scared and don\u2019t want to even sit. But Dr.Harveen made it so easy by talking and explaining the process to Ranveer in such a soft way .. that he agreed immoderately.  Dr.Harveen and her team are fully aware of latest technology and upgrades. She advices about good and comfortable care for oral hygiene... it\u2019s so so important. After her guidance we as a family follow her instructions and are benefited so much. \nI would advice all young kids mothers specially, if they need a dentist then it\u2019s Dr.Harveen. She has improved our Smiles. All the best Dr. Harveen and team. You are the Best. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
