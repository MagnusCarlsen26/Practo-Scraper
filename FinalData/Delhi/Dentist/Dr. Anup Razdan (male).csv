None,None,0,0,NO,"Went to this great doctor just cause of the name of Ganga ram hospital for braces on my teeth . He extracted 4 teeth, took 2 years , charged more than 50 000 rupees and left me with the look of a puckered old aged profile . I had an overbite , to correct it , he extracted teeth from both upper and lower jaws which left the overbite still intact in place . Plus he also gave me retroclined teeth as a side effect of his lesser knowledge of the field . Other dentists all from PGI CHANDIGARH AIIMS warned me my teeth roots have come out cause of defective treatment and carried risk of falling out of my jaws",2015-12-25 13:11:20,False,False,Mansa,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,NO,"Not satisfied with service by him
I took treatment for rct last year they charge high as compared to market rate rct filling remains for 1 year only now need to re filling 
Not happy with service ",2019-03-11 10:52:40,False,False,Ravindra Bhoite,"Single sitting Rct is more expensive than normal rct  and i  always inform the patient of charges before we start the treatment and he has every right to refuse if one finds charges on expensive side and i always recommend a PFM cap after the Rct However why you have not got a crown placed on your Root canaled tooth. . However the filling can come off due to many reasons and    you can. Come and get a fresh filling done  it is advised to get a crown on your tooth than go for just a filling 
Thanks for your feedback sir",2019-03-12T08:24:33+0000,Dr. Anup Razdan
