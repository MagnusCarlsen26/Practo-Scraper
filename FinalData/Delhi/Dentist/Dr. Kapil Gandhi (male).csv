I have a condition called amelogenesis imperfecta, due to which my teeth have little to no enamel, and they are yellow, oddly shaped and weak by nature. Since childhood, I have faced many issues; not being able to smile confidently, not being able to socialise very much, to name a few.

Dr. Gandhi has been with me every step of the way, expertly filling cavities, and making my teeth look aesthetically pleasing with the help of veneers and composite. His treatment gave me the much needed confidence that was so absent from my life.

Recently I was suggested by him that it was finally time for a more permanent solution, crowns. So, we decided to go through with the treatment and it was the best decision I have ever made. He carried out the treatment with extreme precision and care, and now I have the best smile I could have ever asked for. I can laugh freely, I can smile freely, I can talk to anyone without subconsciously thinking that what would the other person think about my teeth. I will forever be grateful to him, and I truly believe that no other person could have done this good of a job.",2024-08-03 17:27:50,False,True,Arnav Bhatia,,,
