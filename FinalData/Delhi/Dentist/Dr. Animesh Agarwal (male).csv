I usually don't get convinced easily but when I met Dr Aggarwal, I knew I had to get my braces from him and him only. Oh how he explained the process, the science behind the treatment, answers to my doubts and anything and everything. 
I started with my treatment in Jan 2016 and to date I never had a problem with timings, appointment reschedules or the treatment itself.

Regarding the treatment, in a nutshell I am super happy after I have gotten the braces off. My teeth are very well adjusted and I have no pain or discomfort whatsoever. I still wear my retainers.

Getting braces will hurt like hell, sleepless nights, sickening health because of not being able to eat most of the times, difficulties in talking and other unwanted associated problems that you get with this package. However, despite a long battle of 1.5 years it will always be worth your efforts to get healthy teeth and gums. I tend to think that it's okay to be uncomfortable for all this time than regretting it later in life that we should have gotten it done when we could. Getting your teeth adjusted is much better than getting them pulled out of your mouth. Originals are the best (I hope everyone would agree).

I do recommend (sorry STRONGLY recommend, can't emphasise this enough) Dr Aggarwal if you need a dental treatment. AND...If you want to understand the treatment well, would like to go to a well-equipped, hygienic clinic, looking for a dentist who would NOT simply treat you for anything to make some money, want your dentist to be polite and supportive, and of all importance...for ***** results possible, go to Delhi Dental Cosmetics.

My sincere thanks to Dr Animesh Agarwal as he gave my old tooth a new life by his efforts.

My issue was regarding problem in my root canal...I have got my Root Canal done from a doctor in a private hospital long back...Few days back in the RCT area i could feel the pain and could see the swelling in my gums...I visited that Doctor from where i have got treated and he told me to get tooth implantation..At such a young age of 25,I dont want to get the tooth implantated..I asked him if there‚Äôs any substitute, so he told me that we can give a try by doing re-RCT but we are not sure that whether tooth will b able to survive or not. So he suggested me not to get re-RCT done and just go with implantation of tooth.

I visited 3-4 doctors more to have their opinion on the same and I got mixed reviews where some of them told that my tooth will not be able to survive and i should go with implantation procedure while the others suggested me me go with re-RCT.

Meanwhile, someone suggested to me visit Dr Animesh‚Äôs clinic as well..I went to his clinic and met him.. First impression say much and working in a clean environment is essential for every medical staff...The clinic is very neat and clean everytime i have visited the clinic for my treatment.

He checked my tooth thoroughly and at first instance he told me your tooth will survive and there‚Äôs no need for implantation. He checked my tooth with OPG report and showed me the infected area and explained me everything in detail..I felt extremely satisfied with his advice at each step he gave and started treatment with him.

When i entered his clinic, I just wanted good treatment from a professional hand so that I don't have to repent and repay for my treatment in future and obviously minimal pain in all this. But Animesh Agarwal is in real sense is none less than an artist with lots of energy to talk and work and educated me more and more about my problem. Till date I never felt that a dentist can be of this type and nature also.
His empathetic nature makes it so easy for a patient to feel comfortable and at ease in his capable hands. He is confident, ************* *** ******** and I believe it was truly due to these factors that I felt virtually no pain during or after my root canal treatment & tooth extraction. I had to get a wisdom tooth extracted surgically since the tooth was lodged under the jaw bone.  I had stitches inside my mouth and I could not believe that I didn‚Äôt require taking any pain killer for not more than 2 days to deal with the pain (although he had recommended pain killers to ease the pain and discomfort).
I strongly recommand him for dental problems.
