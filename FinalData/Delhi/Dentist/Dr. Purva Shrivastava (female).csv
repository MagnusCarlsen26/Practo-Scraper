"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Visited Essence Dental for RCT last week. Found Dr Purva to be very knowledgeable, skilful and well versed in her work. She is professional yet empathetic in her treatment and took great pains to alleviate doubts regarding the dental issues and their treatment . Her ethical approach especially came as a breath of fresh air . The clinic was compact and clean with a clutter - free set up with a special mention of the very quotable quotes on the walls. Will heartily recommend to all for efficient treatment of dental problems with care and a smile.
