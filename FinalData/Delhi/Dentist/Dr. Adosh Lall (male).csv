I was trying to connect with Dr. Adosh Lall for a long time, but being failed due to some technical reason. 

Luckily, I received a call like a gift from Dr. Adosh to visit @ Apollo on 01/28/2020. I was suffering from multiple issues with my teeth. 

Before sharing  the feedback, one word to say, what a TREMENDOUS PERSONALITY DR ADOSH.  I just forgot everything by hearing his voice and polite way of talking.

Next day when I visited the hospital, he welcome with a grand happiness and elaborated each issues bit by bit without any hurry leaving huge smile on my face.  I was feeling like cureness has already begun without starting the treatment.

I salute his utmost level of treatment......his commitment and assurance regarding the action plan, i.e completely awesome. 

I had connected with him around 40 minutes,  he was continuously trying to encouraging me and  building the trust. He was too friendly.
He is a great human being  gifted by smile and always sharing the same to all.

Whenever  a patient  goes through  scaling  and polishing  , transiently  sensitivity and feeling of weakness increases for a  while but subsides gradually  and eventually  dissapears over a period of time.

 These tartar  deposits over teeth  prevent sensitivity from hot and cold , but lead to gingivitis ( gum disease) so cleaning  must  not be avoided.  
As regards  prescription  I feel any Dr must NOT  prescribe  medication  if not needed or  and wait to prescribe   as generally majority patients do not need any medication  after a basic procedure  like scaling and polishing . 

Lastly  incase your symptoms  do not improve within   a short  while after treatment please feel free  to visit us to rectify  the problem  that have been not addressed.  We will look forward to treating you and correcting any omissions.
