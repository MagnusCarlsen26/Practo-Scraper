But you should know that CGHS norms allow you for Metal Caps or Acrylic Facing Metal Caps. ECHS/ CGHS DONT ALLOW COSMETIC TREATMENTS LIKE CERAMIC CAPS OR ZIRCONIA CAPS. Obviously if one needs treatment which is not a listed treatment according to CGHS/ ECHS guidelines the patient need to pay the difference amount.

PLEASE GIVE FEEDBACKS WHICH ARE CORRECT IN NATURE AS FALSE FEEDBACKS TARNISHES DOCTOR PATIENT RELASIONSHIP WHICH IS VERY NEET AND RESPECTED BY PRACTICES LIKE DELHI DENTAL HUB.

"Doctor friendliness,",None,0,0,NO,"To make sure that patient is comfortable , explain him in such a way that he/she doesn't panic or get scared.

",2017-10-28 19:11:01,False,False,Verified Patient,"Sharing the facts about the condition and intensity of a particular problem shuld not make a patient panic or scared but instead makes an individual realize about the quantum of ailment. Definately severe diseases can also be treated and managed and every doctor has this tendency to fight with a disease till the end and we at Delhi Dental Hub  not being an exception to it.

Being upfront and revealing the truth to the patient is not wrong though the same can sometimes be perceived  with a pinch of salt by the individual. 

We never want to make any of our patients uncomfortable but still certain words when put straight might sound harsh but are true.

Nothing is impossible if treated and managed  before it is too late.
