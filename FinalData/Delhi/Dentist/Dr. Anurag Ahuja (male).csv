I recently visited Dr. Anurag Ahuja at city dental centre in noida ,sector 61 . I was having sensitivity in my tooth since 7-8 days. My tooth has become quite sensitive  to  hot & cold temp so, I consulted  him.
Firstly, I have to wait for almost an hour though my online appointment was confirmed. He was quite friendly. When I told him about my issue, he told me that one of my tooth is having faulty crown  because of which my nerves are exposed and have become sensitive. He suggested me to remove that crown and get a new crown for my tooth.He shared price list of different kinds of crown. Since, my crown was under warranty for 10yrs so I checked with my Dentist in Bangalore  who has done RCT for that  tooth. He told me to share x-ray of my tooth for crown replacement. I contacted city dental center to share xray of my tooth but they didn't  responded. Since I was going out of town ,so I didn't  want to remove my crown and postponed it till I come back. 
Today, I consulted another dentist  as my previous experience was not good *** ** ** ***** ******** ** **** ** **** *** ***** ** **********  **** *** ***** ** ** **** ** ****** *** **** ** ****** ******* ** **** **** ********** ******  ** *** ***** **** **** ** ****** *** ** *** ***** ********** ",2019-06-22 18:28:04,False,False,Priti singh,,,

Honestly speaking i got my RCT done and it was an okayish experience. I did not face any pain. But, there are certain things which i did not like at all. 
1- Treatments done here will cost you in a higher side. One tooth RCT costed me 10000rs. With capping without warranty. 
2- I am highly highly dissappointed with the wait time. They make you wait for hours and hours. They will give u appointment of 2:30pm and you will have to wait till 4pm to finally meet the dentist. 
3- The staff at reception is highly inefficient in managing clients. They do not give you any sensible reason of the process they follow in managing appointments. 

So if you have a whole day to spend here for getting a dental treatment done..yes go for it.

I have had 3 sittings so far and am really satisfied with Dr. Ahuja.

Also, 2 dentists before him had strongly advised me to go for braces to cure my sensitivity issue, which Dr. Anurag never felt the need for. He simply advised me to go for gums cleaning since my gums were swollen (which I could see in the pics as well), which would bring down the sensitivity.

He handled a very critical & complicated part of my Mothers Caps and root canal issues without even a bit of pain and supported and comforted my mother from time to time in my absence during the entire time to sort out the complicated part. Almost all the teeth capping were in a very crucial and complex stage so much so that any dentist would think twice prior taking the job into his hands. Dr.Anurag & his staff had been kind enough to handle this serious issue and sort it out bringing back the confidence in my mother once again. I sincerely thank Dr.Anurag and his staff million times for bringing back the smile not only to my mother but also to us as a family.

My previous dentist performed root canal and he still insisted on placing a cap inspite of the pain still being there and gave me stronger pain killers.Then I decided to have a second opinion and was recommended to Dr.Anurag by a colleague and I'm so glad of being treated by him. He diagnosed the problem and recommended a repeat root canal as the canals were not cleaned till the root which is why the pain still existed. I had pain in my upper tooth which my previous dentist diagnosed as ""sensitivity"". When Dr. Anurag checked it he mentioned that it was referred pain caused by my wisdom tooth. My root canal was done by doctor and it was completely painless.My advice to everyone is to not choose a dentist only because they charge you less. I went through a 2 month horrendous experience.While my problem was solved by Dr.Anurag in just 4 visits. I would recommend him for all your dental promblems",2018-07-08 07:57:14,False,True,Sonal,Thanks.,2018-07-09T09:18:15+0000,Dr. Anurag Ahuja
