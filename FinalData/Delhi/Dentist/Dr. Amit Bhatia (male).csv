"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Ceramic Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"Smile like a ceramic beauty is the mantra I started following when I went through ceramic braces.
Amazing doctors, friendly behaviour, always in constant touch with patients. Instant results in the treatment. Undoubtedly I made the best decision walking at Dr. Amit Bhatia's clinic and definitely going through a friendly brace treatment. 
Would love to recommend his treatment and his team.
