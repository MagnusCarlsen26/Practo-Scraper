"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"* **** * ******** *** **** ********* ************* ******** ******** I am Punit Dubey, a high school teacher from DELHI UTTAM NAGAR. Many thanks to Dr. Abhishek Shekhar, his Assistants and team for making me feel comfortable and respectfully treated in your clinic. I came with the goal of being able to chew food properly again after many years of losing molars. To get a smile back was to be a bonus and we achieved all of that. I had researched implants thoroughly and I liked best, Dr. Abhishek Shekhar's procedure of single-piece basal implants (permanent teeth in 3 days). Implant procedure in India at the clinic in India was an affordable option for me. I had full mouth reconstruction followed with NexxZr zirconia bridge (metal free bridge) in India. For those thinking about this, I say to you, come prepared to make decisions. The 3 biggest ones to me were, deciding : style (shape), length and colour of teeth. Take a good look in the mirror to know your teeth. That will help you with decisions to make. Dr. Abhishek Shekhar is a perfectionist in his work. 
His treatment is 
1.Affordable
2.Easy on pocket 
3.Perfect with durability
4.Care and concern is top notch
I felt I received the best treatment possible.

He gave different options for the choice of crown/bridge which is very appreciable. The bridge fitted perfectly on implants on the first attempt. I didn't have to consult him back after my treatment, so no side effects I have so far.  Even if I am Swede, I consider Dr. Abhishek as my Dentist furthermore.

Dr. Abhishek have been serious in taking care of me.  I highly recommend him to anyone who needs teeth care to consult with him.
