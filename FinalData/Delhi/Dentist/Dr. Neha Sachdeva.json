My pain threshold limit is a little low and she made sure to give me rest and made the treatment less painful and comfortable. I have previously had my wisdom tooth removed from her and that experience was also a smooth sail. No swelling or pain or discomfort even after the anesthesia wore off. I recommend her to all my family and friends. ",

My pain threshold limit is a little low and she made sure to give me rest and made the treatment less painful and comfortable. I have previously had my wisdom tooth removed from her and that experience was also a smooth sail. No swelling or pain or discomfort even after the anesthesia wore off. I recommend her to all my family and friends. ",

I was so happy with her work that I even got my mother and father treated for their dental issues from her. All three of us have been very satisfied and have become her loyal patients for life! \nPS: My parents underwent root canal procedures, cavities and dead tooth extraction.",

Depending upon the deposits( both amount and thickness) in patient's mouth, the piezoelectric scaler tip (instrument used to do scaling) gets heated up in 8-10 minutes. Hence we have to stop because the heated instrument can lead to sensitivity and further damage to your teeth.",
