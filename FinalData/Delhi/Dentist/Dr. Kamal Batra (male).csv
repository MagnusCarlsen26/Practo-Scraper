"Doctor friendliness,","Dental Crowns,",0,0,YES,"What I liked:
1. The Lady at reception who co-ordinated the appointment with us was friendly.
2. Docter was friendly.

What can be Improved:
1. We wanted replacement teeth for my wife. Docter explained us possible solutions - Dental crowns and Implants *** ** ***** **** ********* **** ***** ** ********* **** ***** ** ****** *** ** ***** 

2. Be transparent, when it comes to Money!
Okay so on Practo it says the consultation fee is Rs 300 and with that belief we went for a consultation but I was surprised at the end when the Lady at reception asked for Rs 500 instead!

Their justification - Due to Covid-19 situation they couldn't update consultation fee on Practo. ***** ******** *** ****** ********* ****** *** ******** *** ** ***** **** * ******* ** ****** **** ************ ** *** **** ** **** ** ******** Anyway, I still believed it.

Then, I actually waited few days to write this review,  just to see if they would later update their fee but sadly as if today it still says Rs 300 :(

UPDATE:
I just received call from Dr. Batra and he clarified both the points mentioned above.

For first point, he said that he prefers doing tests just before beginning the treatment. Its his preference and I feel that doing it this way is also fine.

For second point, he clarified that the consultation fee is Rs 500 now and he couldn't update it on Practo as the team responsible for it is on vacation.
