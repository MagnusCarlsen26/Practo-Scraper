She far exceeded all my expectations and put to rest any apprehensions and anxiety.\n\nTo give some context, I am at high risk of Jaw Osteonecrosis, which causes the jaw bone to collapse, so any dental work - even a simple cavity becomes a high risk procedure. Add to that, I needed molar tooth extraction, which was heavily infected. And needed  multiple cavity and root-canal treatments. So needless to say my anxiety was at it's peak. \n\nDr Radhika took the time to understand my phycology and gave comfort and trust just like a family member. Then she made a detailed treatment plan for each tooth and explained how she was mitigating any risks. She din't rush the treatment or suggest any excessive treatment, and provided the least invasive procedures with very quick recovery time. While pain was the least of my concerns, but I can gladly say that after each treatment I had to literally ask her if it's done as I din't feel a thing :)\n\n*** ** *** *** ******* *** * ****** ******* ******* *** **** *********** * ********** *** ******* ******* **** **** ** ******* **** *** ******** ",

I vouch for radhika sahni ...she is so young but terrific in her job. Close your eyes and only patronise her..trust me you will thank me post your experience..her entire staff is able and efficient..but then leadership stems from top down..radhika thank you..please do let doctor know how deeply indebted I am as she has relieved me of my agony..  radhika is my doctor dentist for life....from radhika Rai Gupta ",

I am not from Delhi and I found them on Practo and I will recommend them blindly to anyone who is looking for a dentist. Oh also, their clinic is so lovely. It immediately puts you at peace.

Dr. Radhika Sahni provides state-of-the-art treatment and her value proposition is peerless.

She far exceeded all my expectations and put to rest any apprehensions and anxiety.\n\nTo give some context, I am at high risk of Jaw Osteonecrosis, which causes the jaw bone to collapse, so any dental work - even a simple cavity becomes a high risk procedure. Add to that, I needed molar tooth extraction, which was heavily infected. And needed  multiple cavity and root-canal treatments. So needless to say my anxiety was at it's peak. \n\nDr Radhika took the time to understand my phycology and gave comfort and trust just like a family member. Then she made a detailed treatment plan for each tooth and explained how she was mitigating any risks. She din't rush the treatment or suggest any excessive treatment, and provided the least invasive procedures with very quick recovery time. While pain was the least of my concerns, but I can gladly say that after each treatment I had to literally ask her if it's done as I din't feel a thing :)\n\n*** ** *** *** ******* *** * ****** ******* ******* *** **** *********** * ********** *** ******* ******* **** **** ** ******* **** *** ******** ",

Hygiene in oral care is absolutely paramount and Dr sahnis clinic is a reflection of being super duper clean..you immediately sense a feeling of being in the best of hands and know for sure that you will come out sans infection and healthier...I was running from pillar to post to find a dentist and here she was right under my nose in my very own colony.   I vouch for radhika sahni ...she is so young but terrific in her job. Close your eyes and only patronise her..trust me you will thank me post your experience..her entire staff is able and efficient..but then leadership stems from top down..radhika thank you..please do let doctor know how deeply indebted I am as she has relieved me of my agony..  radhika is my doctor dentist for life....from radhika Rai Gupta ",

I am not from Delhi and I found them on Practo and I will recommend them blindly to anyone who is looking for a dentist. Oh also, their clinic is so lovely. It immediately puts you at peace.

Dr. Radhika Sahni provides state-of-the-art treatment and her value proposition is peerless.
