                "review_text": "I am writing this testimonial to thank Dr. Rajat Sachdeva and I feel privileged to have benefitted from his services. For background, I had multiple amalgam fillings in my teeth that I had got done around 10 years back. It was until very late that I realized that these fillings contains mercury which can cause numerous side effects. \nI had been suffering from painful sores for the last few years, almost since the time I got these amalgam fillings. I never could understand the reason behind this and neither did my previous dentist. The sores were unrelenting and so painful that I wasn\u2019t able to eat or even talk properly. No amount of antibiotics or painkillers would work and I had a constant burning sensation in my mouth. Fortunately, when one of my friends recommended Dr. Rajat Sachdeva\u2019s clinic in Ashok Vihar, I immediately visited him. After a thorough examination and consultation, Dr. Rajat informed me that my mouth sores and ulcers were actually because of the amalgam fillings containing mercury. He suggested that we immediately remove these and replace them with non-metallic, biocompatible composite material. After my wilful consent, Dr. Rajat proceeded with the treatment and almost immediately, my sores disappeared and has not recurred ever since. \nSMART (Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Technique) was followed while strictly adhering to all the safety regulations. An amalgam separator was specially installed which was utilized to collect the mercury and the operating room was well-ventilated with a high-volume air filtration system. I was made to wear the protective gear including nasal masks, gowns and head cover. The entire team assisting the procedure including Dr. Rajat were well-protected too. A rubber was used to avoid any spillage and all the materials used were non-latex and sterile. The entire procedure was done with High speed evacuation and with utmost precision. Once the procedure was over, the operating team carefully eliminated and disposed mercury wastage while maintaining all the safety protocols. The level of professionalism seen was highly reassuring.\nI am extremely thankful to Dr. Rajat for the pioneering individual he is and believing his knowledge and experience beyond the scope of controversy. He is a brilliant diagnostician and very professional. I hold high regard for him and would definitely recommend him to everyone.",

                "review_text": "I had unfortunately lost my front tooth due to an accident a couple of years back. Although I got a temporary restoration for it, my smile has never been the same. Not only did this affect my smile but also my speech. I was recommended to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva\u2019s clinic by a friend of mine.  After a long hiatus between my dental visits, I was apprehensive and very nervous but I can say that I had the best experience at Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic as he made me most comfortable and relaxed. He suggested me to go for an implant for my missing tooth, and based on my CBCT scans, it was the best option for me. So, I decided to choose a single dental implant. Since it was the front tooth and had significant effect on my smile, the dentist was extremely careful and meticulously planned the entire treatment. I was even shown the end-result and it looked very promising.  I was called in early on the day of surgery, and the entire procedure did not even take an hour. It was completely painless and minimally invasive. I was able to see the procedure as it was being done on the screen, and it was later given to me as my dental record. The attention to details and executing the treatment to perfection would definitely be the stand-outs of this clinic. The practice is very professional and compassionate at the same time. Throughout the process, everything was described in detail as to the road ahead, the timescale of all future visits, the costs which were spread over the whole dental treatment and the follow up visits and regular checking on all dental issues.  After the procedure, I was given a temporary restoration so that I wouldn\u2019t be toothless. My final crown came a few weeks later and it fitted like a glove. The shape, size and color of the crown was just like my other tooth, and it perfectly blended in. My speech was also clearer, the lisp was gone and I finally had a clear diction. This was truly the best possible outcome that I expected to achieve with my implant.  Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic is truly a perfect place for getting your dental problems treated. They run an excellent, highly organized and exceptionally clean practice with top-notch facilities and technology. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.",

Dr. Rajat\u2019s dental clinic in Ashok Vihar can be truly called a representation of painless dentistry. \nOwing to years of neglect and malfunction, I had ended up with a rather unpleasant smile. I had a few missing teeth and several of them were completely worn out. When I consulted Dr. Rajat with my issues, he was very supportive and motivated me to go for a full mouth smile makeover. Before we moved forward with my case, a CBCT scan was advised which revealed in-and-out of my teeth and jaws. Based on the interpretations of these scans, Dr. Rajat formulated the treatment plan; which consisted of many procedures which included rehabilitation of missing teeth, crowns and veneers for worn-out teeth and to fill the gaps between my upper front teeth. Most of teeth were decayed and had to be restored as well. \nAs the treatment started, I was made quite comfortable and even the complex of the procedures like placement of implants were done effortlessly. In all my appointments, the chair time did not exceed for more than an hour and that just shows the expertise of your treating dentist. Emax and Zirconia crowns were fabricated using CAD CAM software and the value they added to my aesthetics was substantial. \nSeveral of my teeth were decayed, few of which needed root canal treatments. Lasers was used to eliminate the infection completely and quickly too. It was definitely reassuring to be able to watch the procedure done on your teeth, and Dr. Rajat made it possible by use of dental microscopes. I could actually see what exactly went in and came out of those tiny canals. The evolution of dentistry never ceased to amaze me. \nFor the final touch, I underwent a teeth whitening procedure using Philips Zoom! equipment. It is a rather magical technique, for the results were eminent immediately. Overall, I can say that Dr. Rajat has worked wonders with my smile and I can only than him and his team for my newfound confidence. Not only that, my function has also improved considerably and I can now bite into my favorite foods without any fear of sensitivity or pain. Thank you for giving me a confident smile.",

I had tried a number of at home remedies for teeth whitening like lemon and vinegar but nothing worked much. When I finally decided to take a professional help, I started to search a good dentist near me. \nDr. Sachdeva's Dental clinic had many positive reviews on Google and had carried out multiple successful whitening procedures. So I consulted him and he advised me zoom whitening. The most important thing that he warned me was that the procedure would be a success if only I followed post-operative instructions like no smoking for at least a month and no chromogemic beverages like tea or coffee for a week. It was good to understand the technique and its outcome before I finalize it. \nThe procedure was rather simple and completely pain free. Once they apply the bleaching gel, it is activated using LED light-accelerated technology which almost instantly whitens your teeth. The process was repeated four times until I got the desired shade. The results are seen almost immediately and improves over the due course. I got about 5 shades brighter teeth on the very same day. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself. Dr. Rajat has done fantastic work with my teeth and I am really grateful for that. I was even provided with GC tooth mousse paste which helped rebuild the tooth structure lost to decay and would lessen the sensitivity. The entire experience at Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic was very positive and encouraging. His focus is primarily based on educating the patients about the oral health and the treatments are aimed to improve the overall quality of life.  I am completely satisfied with the service I have received and I would highly recommend Dr. Sachdeva's dentistry to everyone.",

When I finally decided to do something about it, I consulted Dr. Rajat Sachdeva. He is a renowned cosmetic dentist in Ashok Vihar, Delhi. He informed me that these yellowish stains on the teeth are normal and may result due to multiple factors like from age, food and beverages. When he suggested Philips Zoom whitening procedure, I readily agreed because it has a good reputation and it is one of the best tooth whitening kits in the market.\nI had to get a scaling procedure done at first where they cleaned the plaque and tartar on my teeth. This was done so that the whitening procedure would be effective. The procedure began by covering my lips and gums and only my teeth were exposed. This was done apparently to protect them from the UV light. Zoom whitening gel was applied onto my teeth and a zoom light was shone which helped activate the gel. The gel remained on my teeth for maybe 15-20 minutes. They repeated this procedure thrice after which a desensitizing fluoride gel was applied to reduce sensitivity. \nThe entire process of teeth whitening using Philips Zoom whitening procedure took about just an hour and the results were mind-blowing. My teeth looked significantly whiter and my smile was radiant. I would like to thank Dr. Rajat and his team for their incredible work with my teeth. I really appreciate it. I would highly recommend his clinic for such cosmetic procedures.",

According to me, teeth is one of the most important and prominent feature in one\u2019s face. And choosing a right dentist for your teeth is equally important. I am lucky to have chosen Dr. Rajat Sachdeva as my dentist because he has given me the most amazing smile in the least time.\nMy teeth have been otherwise fine, but was much discolored. From what I read online and confirmed by Dr. Rajat himself, it was due to intake of beverages like tea and coffee (among other reasons). I was going to get married soon and the day of wedding is undoubtedly the most important day of one\u2019s life. I simply wanted to look best in photographs.\nWhen I visited Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic, I was really impressed with the entire ambience. It was certainly well-organized, clean and soothing. Dr. Rajat himself is a very personable, informative and skilled dentist. He recommended me to go for Philip\u2019s Zoom whitening procedure to get whiter teeth. The entire procedure lasted for about an hour and was completely painless. Their clinic is fully equipped to carry out such high-tech procedures with maximum efficiency. The staff are well-trained too and were very supportive throughout the process. \nThe procedure basically starts with a routine cleaning of the teeth after which the actual whitening procedure commences. They apply a bleaching gel containing hydrogen peroxide which is then activated using LED light. This process is repeated for around four times, depending on the shade you want or amount of discoloration. You can listen to a relaxing music while the gel does its magic. Once the session ends, a paste was put to reduce post-whitening sensitivity. The results were fantastic, and my teeth were almost 8-shades brighter. I feel very confident now and definitely looking forward to flaunt my smile at my wedding.",

It has been a very comfortable and pleasant experience that has given me back my confidence. I had a tongue-tie since childhood and have been struggling because of it all my childhood. My basic functions like eating and talking were affected to an extent that I had become a complete introvert. \nWhen I consulted Dr. Rajat about my problem, he informed me that my frenum (or frenulum) below the tongue was short and abnormally attached to the floor of the mouth. He advised me to get frenectomy done using laser technique.\nThe procedure was absolutely painless and safe and was carried out in the clinic by Dr. Rajat himself. I was first made completely comfortable in my chair with a light, soothing music. The procedure was explained to me first before being carried out, further calming my nerves. As the procedure began, I was given a topical anesthetic spray on the frenum so that the needle prick would not hurt. Thereafter, local anesthesia was administered in that area. Within minutes, I was completely numb in and around the frenulum part. The entire procedure then was carried out using lasers, where they incised the tissue using a laser-activated surgical tip. There was minimal blood loss and no sutures were given after the procedure. I was given detailed post-operative instructions by the staff. Dr. Rajat made sure that the treatment was entirely safe and everyone present in the operating room including me, him and his assistants wore protective goggles. \nI was instructed not to have any hot or spicy foods and that I should maintain meticulous oral hygiene. They even prescribed me some painkillers and I was recalled after 2 weeks. Healing was satisfactory and free of any complications. Overall, my surgery was a success and the results are amazing. My speech has remarkably improved and is clear as day. I am really thankful to Dr. Rajat and his team for being so supportive and carrying out the procedure so efficiently. I am fully satisfied and will recommend his services to others too.",

To my surprise there is improvement in my speech also!\n\nWith that,\nI had an RCT, and you know the childhood trauma of sitting on that dentist chair and those big injections! But Dr. Rajat Sachdeva is very friendly *** ****** ******* ******* that you'll not even know when the procedure has been done so easily by him! \nAnd even after 14 Months that RCT is going strong and I didn't face any problems in that after since.\n\nI recommend people a regular checkup of their teeth, whenever/wherever possible! because I didn't even know that I had so many cavities which could all end up in RCTs but were timely filled and saved at this clinic!\n\nLast but not least, \nA big thanks to the Orthodontist who has been working on my teeth since over a year!  \nAnd a big thanks to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva under whom it has all become possible.\n\nWill update soon when the whole procedure is done.\nand now i can smile with my teeth out (Literally) :D !!\n\nThanks",

I had a severe toothache and had consulted him at around 1 am in the morning. He went beyond his call of duty and helped me deal with my pain. \nI called him prior visiting him and he, without any second thought called me to his office. My tooth was grossly decayed, an issue I had been ignoring for some time now. But one night, it suddenly flared up and the pain was unimaginable. It radiated to my ear and later, the entire side of my face was throbbing. As soon as I visited him, he started an IV line with analgesics. He was constantly by my side till the pain lessened and then an X-ray was taken, following which he decided to extract it. He performed the entire procedure with no difficulty and I was immediately relieved of the pain. I visited him the next day for follow-up and my wound had healed satisfactorily. \nI have really learnt my lesson to never ignore a decayed tooth and I encourage others to do the same. Thank you Dr. Rajat and his team for everything.",

For background, I had multiple amalgam fillings in my teeth that I had got done around 10 years back. It was until very late that I realized that these fillings contains mercury which can cause numerous side effects. \nI had been suffering from painful sores for the last few years, almost since the time I got these amalgam fillings. I never could understand the reason behind this and neither did my previous dentist. The sores were unrelenting and so painful that I wasn\u2019t able to eat or even talk properly. No amount of antibiotics or painkillers would work and I had a constant burning sensation in my mouth. Fortunately, when one of my friends recommended Dr. Rajat Sachdeva\u2019s clinic in Ashok Vihar, I immediately visited him. After a thorough examination and consultation, Dr. Rajat informed me that my mouth sores and ulcers were actually because of the amalgam fillings containing mercury. He suggested that we immediately remove these and replace them with non-metallic, biocompatible composite material. After my wilful consent, Dr. Rajat proceeded with the treatment and almost immediately, my sores disappeared and has not recurred ever since. \nSMART (Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Technique) was followed while strictly adhering to all the safety regulations. An amalgam separator was specially installed which was utilized to collect the mercury and the operating room was well-ventilated with a high-volume air filtration system. I was made to wear the protective gear including nasal masks, gowns and head cover. The entire team assisting the procedure including Dr. Rajat were well-protected too. A rubber was used to avoid any spillage and all the materials used were non-latex and sterile. The entire procedure was done with High speed evacuation and with utmost precision. Once the procedure was over, the operating team carefully eliminated and disposed mercury wastage while maintaining all the safety protocols. The level of professionalism seen was highly reassuring.\nI am extremely thankful to Dr. Rajat for the pioneering individual he is and believing his knowledge and experience beyond the scope of controversy. He is a brilliant diagnostician and very professional. I hold high regard for him and would definitely recommend him to everyone.",

                "review_text": "I had unfortunately lost my front tooth due to an accident a couple of years back. Although I got a temporary restoration for it, my smile has never been the same. Not only did this affect my smile but also my speech. I was recommended to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva\u2019s clinic by a friend of mine.  After a long hiatus between my dental visits, I was apprehensive and very nervous but I can say that I had the best experience at Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic as he made me most comfortable and relaxed. He suggested me to go for an implant for my missing tooth, and based on my CBCT scans, it was the best option for me. So, I decided to choose a single dental implant. Since it was the front tooth and had significant effect on my smile, the dentist was extremely careful and meticulously planned the entire treatment. I was even shown the end-result and it looked very promising.  I was called in early on the day of surgery, and the entire procedure did not even take an hour. It was completely painless and minimally invasive. I was able to see the procedure as it was being done on the screen, and it was later given to me as my dental record. The attention to details and executing the treatment to perfection would definitely be the stand-outs of this clinic. The practice is very professional and compassionate at the same time. Throughout the process, everything was described in detail as to the road ahead, the timescale of all future visits, the costs which were spread over the whole dental treatment and the follow up visits and regular checking on all dental issues.  After the procedure, I was given a temporary restoration so that I wouldn\u2019t be toothless. My final crown came a few weeks later and it fitted like a glove. The shape, size and color of the crown was just like my other tooth, and it perfectly blended in. My speech was also clearer, the lisp was gone and I finally had a clear diction. This was truly the best possible outcome that I expected to achieve with my implant.  Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic is truly a perfect place for getting your dental problems treated. They run an excellent, highly organized and exceptionally clean practice with top-notch facilities and technology. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.",

Dr. Rajat\u2019s dental clinic in Ashok Vihar can be truly called a representation of painless dentistry. \nOwing to years of neglect and malfunction, I had ended up with a rather unpleasant smile. I had a few missing teeth and several of them were completely worn out. When I consulted Dr. Rajat with my issues, he was very supportive and motivated me to go for a full mouth smile makeover. Before we moved forward with my case, a CBCT scan was advised which revealed in-and-out of my teeth and jaws. Based on the interpretations of these scans, Dr. Rajat formulated the treatment plan; which consisted of many procedures which included rehabilitation of missing teeth, crowns and veneers for worn-out teeth and to fill the gaps between my upper front teeth. Most of teeth were decayed and had to be restored as well. \nAs the treatment started, I was made quite comfortable and even the complex of the procedures like placement of implants were done effortlessly. In all my appointments, the chair time did not exceed for more than an hour and that just shows the expertise of your treating dentist. Emax and Zirconia crowns were fabricated using CAD CAM software and the value they added to my aesthetics was substantial. \nSeveral of my teeth were decayed, few of which needed root canal treatments. Lasers was used to eliminate the infection completely and quickly too. It was definitely reassuring to be able to watch the procedure done on your teeth, and Dr. Rajat made it possible by use of dental microscopes. I could actually see what exactly went in and came out of those tiny canals. The evolution of dentistry never ceased to amaze me. \nFor the final touch, I underwent a teeth whitening procedure using Philips Zoom! equipment. It is a rather magical technique, for the results were eminent immediately. Overall, I can say that Dr. Rajat has worked wonders with my smile and I can only than him and his team for my newfound confidence. Not only that, my function has also improved considerably and I can now bite into my favorite foods without any fear of sensitivity or pain. Thank you for giving me a confident smile.",

I had tried a number of at home remedies for teeth whitening like lemon and vinegar but nothing worked much. When I finally decided to take a professional help, I started to search a good dentist near me. \nDr. Sachdeva's Dental clinic had many positive reviews on Google and had carried out multiple successful whitening procedures. So I consulted him and he advised me zoom whitening. The most important thing that he warned me was that the procedure would be a success if only I followed post-operative instructions like no smoking for at least a month and no chromogemic beverages like tea or coffee for a week. It was good to understand the technique and its outcome before I finalize it. \nThe procedure was rather simple and completely pain free. Once they apply the bleaching gel, it is activated using LED light-accelerated technology which almost instantly whitens your teeth. The process was repeated four times until I got the desired shade. The results are seen almost immediately and improves over the due course. I got about 5 shades brighter teeth on the very same day. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself. Dr. Rajat has done fantastic work with my teeth and I am really grateful for that. I was even provided with GC tooth mousse paste which helped rebuild the tooth structure lost to decay and would lessen the sensitivity. The entire experience at Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic was very positive and encouraging. His focus is primarily based on educating the patients about the oral health and the treatments are aimed to improve the overall quality of life.  I am completely satisfied with the service I have received and I would highly recommend Dr. Sachdeva's dentistry to everyone.",

When I finally decided to do something about it, I consulted Dr. Rajat Sachdeva. He is a renowned cosmetic dentist in Ashok Vihar, Delhi. He informed me that these yellowish stains on the teeth are normal and may result due to multiple factors like from age, food and beverages. When he suggested Philips Zoom whitening procedure, I readily agreed because it has a good reputation and it is one of the best tooth whitening kits in the market.\nI had to get a scaling procedure done at first where they cleaned the plaque and tartar on my teeth. This was done so that the whitening procedure would be effective. The procedure began by covering my lips and gums and only my teeth were exposed. This was done apparently to protect them from the UV light. Zoom whitening gel was applied onto my teeth and a zoom light was shone which helped activate the gel. The gel remained on my teeth for maybe 15-20 minutes. They repeated this procedure thrice after which a desensitizing fluoride gel was applied to reduce sensitivity. \nThe entire process of teeth whitening using Philips Zoom whitening procedure took about just an hour and the results were mind-blowing. My teeth looked significantly whiter and my smile was radiant. I would like to thank Dr. Rajat and his team for their incredible work with my teeth. I really appreciate it. I would highly recommend his clinic for such cosmetic procedures.",

According to me, teeth is one of the most important and prominent feature in one\u2019s face. And choosing a right dentist for your teeth is equally important. I am lucky to have chosen Dr. Rajat Sachdeva as my dentist because he has given me the most amazing smile in the least time.\nMy teeth have been otherwise fine, but was much discolored. From what I read online and confirmed by Dr. Rajat himself, it was due to intake of beverages like tea and coffee (among other reasons). I was going to get married soon and the day of wedding is undoubtedly the most important day of one\u2019s life. I simply wanted to look best in photographs.\nWhen I visited Dr. Rajat\u2019s clinic, I was really impressed with the entire ambience. It was certainly well-organized, clean and soothing. Dr. Rajat himself is a very personable, informative and skilled dentist. He recommended me to go for Philip\u2019s Zoom whitening procedure to get whiter teeth. The entire procedure lasted for about an hour and was completely painless. Their clinic is fully equipped to carry out such high-tech procedures with maximum efficiency. The staff are well-trained too and were very supportive throughout the process. \nThe procedure basically starts with a routine cleaning of the teeth after which the actual whitening procedure commences. They apply a bleaching gel containing hydrogen peroxide which is then activated using LED light. This process is repeated for around four times, depending on the shade you want or amount of discoloration. You can listen to a relaxing music while the gel does its magic. Once the session ends, a paste was put to reduce post-whitening sensitivity. The results were fantastic, and my teeth were almost 8-shades brighter. I feel very confident now and definitely looking forward to flaunt my smile at my wedding.",

It has been a very comfortable and pleasant experience that has given me back my confidence. I had a tongue-tie since childhood and have been struggling because of it all my childhood. My basic functions like eating and talking were affected to an extent that I had become a complete introvert. \nWhen I consulted Dr. Rajat about my problem, he informed me that my frenum (or frenulum) below the tongue was short and abnormally attached to the floor of the mouth. He advised me to get frenectomy done using laser technique.\nThe procedure was absolutely painless and safe and was carried out in the clinic by Dr. Rajat himself. I was first made completely comfortable in my chair with a light, soothing music. The procedure was explained to me first before being carried out, further calming my nerves. As the procedure began, I was given a topical anesthetic spray on the frenum so that the needle prick would not hurt. Thereafter, local anesthesia was administered in that area. Within minutes, I was completely numb in and around the frenulum part. The entire procedure then was carried out using lasers, where they incised the tissue using a laser-activated surgical tip. There was minimal blood loss and no sutures were given after the procedure. I was given detailed post-operative instructions by the staff. Dr. Rajat made sure that the treatment was entirely safe and everyone present in the operating room including me, him and his assistants wore protective goggles. \nI was instructed not to have any hot or spicy foods and that I should maintain meticulous oral hygiene. They even prescribed me some painkillers and I was recalled after 2 weeks. Healing was satisfactory and free of any complications. Overall, my surgery was a success and the results are amazing. My speech has remarkably improved and is clear as day. I am really thankful to Dr. Rajat and his team for being so supportive and carrying out the procedure so efficiently. I am fully satisfied and will recommend his services to others too.",

To my surprise there is improvement in my speech also!\n\nWith that,\nI had an RCT, and you know the childhood trauma of sitting on that dentist chair and those big injections! But Dr. Rajat Sachdeva is very friendly *** ****** ******* ******* that you'll not even know when the procedure has been done so easily by him! \nAnd even after 14 Months that RCT is going strong and I didn't face any problems in that after since.\n\nI recommend people a regular checkup of their teeth, whenever/wherever possible! because I didn't even know that I had so many cavities which could all end up in RCTs but were timely filled and saved at this clinic!\n\nLast but not least, \nA big thanks to the Orthodontist who has been working on my teeth since over a year!  \nAnd a big thanks to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva under whom it has all become possible.\n\nWill update soon when the whole procedure is done.\nand now i can smile with my teeth out (Literally) :D !!\n\nThanks",

I had a severe toothache and had consulted him at around 1 am in the morning. He went beyond his call of duty and helped me deal with my pain. \nI called him prior visiting him and he, without any second thought called me to his office. My tooth was grossly decayed, an issue I had been ignoring for some time now. But one night, it suddenly flared up and the pain was unimaginable. It radiated to my ear and later, the entire side of my face was throbbing. As soon as I visited him, he started an IV line with analgesics. He was constantly by my side till the pain lessened and then an X-ray was taken, following which he decided to extract it. He performed the entire procedure with no difficulty and I was immediately relieved of the pain. I visited him the next day for follow-up and my wound had healed satisfactorily. \nI have really learnt my lesson to never ignore a decayed tooth and I encourage others to do the same. Thank you Dr. Rajat and his team for everything.",

Until my husband found Dr. Rajat Sachdeva\u2019s dental clinic in Ashok Vihar. We called in and he asked us to come in.\nWe immediately rushed to his clinic at around 1:30 in the morning, and Dr. Rajat was there waiting for us. He examined my tooth and gave me the necessary and immediate treatment to relieve the pain. He asked me to come the next day for the final restoration. My pain had almost gone after the treatment and I couldn\u2019t stop thanking Dr. Sachdeva. \nHe has become the dentist for my entire family and we haven\u2019t been disappointed once.",

I happen to encounter an emergency a few days back when my father's tooth started giving him trouble and he was in unbearable pain. It was Holi and more so late in the night. I started to panic when all the clinics I knew close by were closed. It was then that I came to know about Dr Sachdeva's Dental clinic from one of my colleagues and I immediately rushed to his clinic.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see Dr. Rajat immediately attend my father. I took a sigh of relief when I finally saw my father relaxed and his pain was alleviated. It just took around 30-45 minutes of treatment and my father felt much much better. \nIt would be injustice on my part if I do not spread a word about the hardwork that Dr Sachdeva and his team are putting in to provide for the best in the wide horizon of dental treatment.",

Everyone I interacted with was kind and friendly, especially Dr. Rajat is the least terrifying dentist I've met (and I don't like dentists).  \n\nWhat's really striking is how hard they've worked to make going to the dentist an enjoyable experience.  They've installed movable TVs in every room with Netflix, and they provide ear buds.  So instead of staring at the ceiling--hoping that you don't feel a sudden twinge of agonizing pain--you can distract yourself with easy entertainment.\n\nMost importantly, my teeth feel great!  They're a new business, so go check them out.",

I am the most difficult patient with lots of problem inside my mouth but the way he explained my treatment procedure now I am hoping that with a time I will get back healthy smile again.The advantage is his clinic is well equipped with new technology and my doctor is superman he has the power to see those problems which you can feel only and sometimes you may not be able to explain. His experienced hand will not let you experience much pain. He is blessed with superpower and he has solution for every problem. I would like to recommend Dr Rajat Sir to everyone including my friends and family. Thanks to every social site which helped me to reach him. ",

My teeth were stained and a few cavities had to be filled as well. I underwent two rounds of thorough scaling and polishing followed by cavity treatment with tooth colored material. It was fairly painless and carried out with utmost care.The prices were reasonable and worth the treatment and facilities provided. Would highly recommend this clinic to everyone.",

Whether or not a patient goes ahead with the suggested treatment is entirely upto them and we respect their decision. However, it is sad that u address my learned colleague as junior doctor. She is well qualified and skilled to perform the procedure that she did and would not be entrusted with our valued patients in case she wasn't. I am certain you do not doubt the co- captain of the plane u fly in. Oh wait- you can't see what happens inside the cockpit or in the kitchen of a restaurant u dine in. Sadly we doctors have all out in the open, transparent for patients to see and judge. I use this platform to proudly say that I have complete faith in my staff and and we are committed to provide best services. \nRegards",

This method repaired my damaged teeth and eliminated sensitivity. His prescription gave protection against further erosion and abrasion to my  teeth. Really he assured his service in a pain free manner! Recommended!!!",

You are never rushed as he only sees one patient at a time which eliminates me lying there with my mouth stuck open while other dentists go room to room. He takes his time to explain things to you and makes sure you fully understand what is going on as well as educating you in a positive way. I have never left there with less than an amazing experience.\n\nI just want to say THANK YOU for making going to the Dentist not so terrible anymore (I mean its still not fun LOL.)",

He doesn't run from room to room working on different patients at the same time. If you have an appointment with him you can count on having his full attention. I know this is going to be difficult to believe but, I was having crowns done today and nearly fell asleep in the chair! You are a priority and your comfort matters from the time you walk in the door. As long as Dr Rajat and staff are within driving range I'll be their forever patient.

I was popping advil like candy. After Dr. Rajat's thorough and astute assessment, he told me I may be clenching my teeth. Once he made me aware of it, I started noticing that I clench while I'm working on the computer and I wake up with a sore jaw (a sign I've been clenching through the night). He suggested Botox in the TMJ muscles but I was skeptical, I didn't want to change the look of my face. He listened to my concerns and told me about stretches and massages I could do at home. These helped but I was still having headaches so I decided to give Botox a try and I'm soooo glad that I did. My headaches are gone, I haven't taken advil in 2 weeks, and my fear of having that frozen face look is gone. I just wish I had done this sooner!",

What a caring, elegant & professional atmosphere. No need to look further...",
