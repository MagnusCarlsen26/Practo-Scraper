Dr. Giroti had to deal with a difficult task in my case. A complete restoration of the front teeth was necessary by implants. The base was already a bone implant, as in an accident the bone was also destroyed beside the teeth. 
The result of His work is amazing: looking absolutely natural and feels completely comfortable from the very first moment. 
Dr. Giroti is a gem, who's profession is his life and soul. His determination and accuracy is outstanding. He is not compromising, rather focusing on the perfect result. He is obviously blessed by the best skills and further more he is a kind, patient and understanding person, who is sensitive of his patient's emotions and struggles. Truly a very rare combination.
