She performed root canal on one of molars as well extraction of a wisdom tooth. I had a very good experience with my treatment. The root canal treatment was practically painless and so was the tooth extraction. The best part was that she is a highly proficient dental surgeon and procedures are quick. The patient feels comfortable. She is soft spoken and understands patients' concerns. She is also  honest in her assessment  and  diagnosis. My two teeth were giving me trouble for the  last two year. Now I am feeling comfortable. I will recommend to my fiends and relatives and will see her in future too, if need arises. ",

She did what she could under the circumstances and time frame I had to stay in India and we rescheduled. I returned to her in September 2019 and she carried out a minor surgery and I have immense relief, I am satisfied so far with the  result of the treatment I received.\n\nThank you Dr Seema.",

But when i consulted dr.seema, she first helped me to overcome my fear and patiently explained about the entire procedure. I was surprised thay she said i don't require any tooth removal and entire procedure will be painless. She was very friendly and supportive throughout my treatment. She gave me porcelain veneers which enhanced my smile and covered the small gaps as well which were present in my front teeth. I m thankful to her from my heart for giving me my smile back and too beautiful one. \nI highly recommend her for any kind of dental treatment. :)",

The patient feels comfortable. She is soft spoken and understands patients' concerns. She is also  honest in her assessment  and  diagnosis. My two teeth were giving me trouble for the  last two year. Now I am feeling comfortable. I will recommend to my fiends and relatives and will see her in future too, if need arises. ",

She did what she could under the circumstances and time frame I had to stay in India and we rescheduled. I returned to her in September 2019 and she carried out a minor surgery and I have immense relief, I am satisfied so far with the  result of the treatment I received.\n\nThank you Dr Seema.",

But when i consulted dr.seema, she first helped me to overcome my fear and patiently explained about the entire procedure. I was surprised thay she said i don't require any tooth removal and entire procedure will be painless. She was very friendly and supportive throughout my treatment. She gave me porcelain veneers which enhanced my smile and covered the small gaps as well which were present in my front teeth. I m thankful to her from my heart for giving me my smile back and too beautiful one. \nI highly recommend her for any kind of dental treatment. :)",

One of which was broken completely from gum level. I was so depressed and worried that it will require extraction. But she amazed me saying I don't require extraction. She did RCTs, fillings and crowns and I got my smile back and more beautiful. I am so happy. She is very nice and very patiently listen and does her work diligently.\nI will recommend to visit her for your dental problems.\nThank you Dr.Seema ",
