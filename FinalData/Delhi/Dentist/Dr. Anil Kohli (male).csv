"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,NO,"1. Not at all hygienic. People walk-in with dirty shoes. Before surgery, there was a showpiece for wrapping shoes with plastic which was just a showoff. It should be outside the clinic but it was near to the dental chair. That person refill that with new plastic caps for shoes and didn't even wash hands before handling over the tools to the doc.

2. Treatment was not well explained, neither the different options.

3. Prior to surgery, he convinced that he is going to put in the implant and the whole surgical procedure. But as soon as surgery is stared, you meet a stranger doctor who actually knows about implants and is going to place one. At that time you cannot do anything. You cannot run from that chair.

4. Procedure, treatment and outcome were 100% translucent. Being a doctor, he should explain everything in detail. Transparency was not there.
