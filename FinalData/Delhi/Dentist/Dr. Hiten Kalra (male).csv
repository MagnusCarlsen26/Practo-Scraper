"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Invisible/Clear Braces,",0,0,YES,"I was searching for a Doc on Practo, or someone to guide me with aligners as i was feeling a bit numbness in my upper teeth. I have already visited a local doctor for consultation, but wanted a second opinion to look for some one with best rating so checked the rating and found 2 doctors with best reviews in Delhi/NCR and visited Dr. kalra initially. (Luckily)

I got myself checked in November 2020 and he guided me with best possible options of how to fix my teeth with all possible options for braces and future plans including monetary saving options.
I had some personal concerns so i went with Invisalign braces which he ordered from overseas as i thought of undergoing the transparent ones as per my case.
Its been almost 6 months and i have atleast 1 more year to go, but i can see the results and how its progressing.

He is really a nice guy to interact with and he takes care of your health concerns proactively and answers all your queries/doubts. I never faced any issues while reaching out to him on phone directly or while rescheduling. Moreover i was mostly late but never faced any changes in his behavior towards me. (Sorry doc)
I can not say that he is the only best doctor out there or only option for your dental care because i don’t know about others as luckily i met him initially, but i would certainly say that he is an expert in his field and turned out to be the best doc for me and my dental care which should be same for others too.
