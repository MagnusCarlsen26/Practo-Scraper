"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,NO,"I had visited the dentist for my front teeth capping. The capping had to be done for two front teeths. First problem i faced was that after almost 17 days of the capping, my caps came out while i was chewing the food. This was not at all acceptable. I had informed doctor and he called the next day for corrections. Then he did add some cementing along with the caps which i am not sure why he did not add in previous fitting. So he did that fixing with cementing. But there was change i observed, teeths were more inwards compared to previous position. So the whole purpose of aesthetics is gone and only thing left was fixing the caps irrespective of the fact how does it look which matters when teeth are front faced. Next time when i visited again, he directly said no and told nothing can be done now. If i want any changes, there will be chances of original teeth to break. So, why the cementing has been done in such a way that it can lead to breakage i do not understand. ****** ****** ** **** ** ** ********** ** *** ****. *** **** ** *** *** ******** ********* **** ** *** ******** ******* ** *** ***** ******
