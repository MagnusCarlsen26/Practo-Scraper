I visited her, she took the x-ray and explained me the procedure and assured that it can definitely be done but might require two or three sittings as it was a difficult tooth to treat on. She completed the treatment in two sittings that too in a very comfortable manner. Thank you so much Dr Shivani.",

I had heard about RCT and was really scared about it, but she calmed me down telling that it would be very comfortable, and as she said the treatment was really comfortable. My pain was relieved and I was almost normal within two to three days. Thank you so much Dr Shivani. She also advised to get a routine checkup done to avoid such experience in future and I really do know now the importance of oral health because I do not want to experience that pain again.

So it was an extensive kind of treatment including few RCTs followed by capping and then extraction of two or three teeth. Things were pretty clear in my mind. I told her to start the treatment. I was a bit skeptical as the past root canal treatments were not that comfortable for me but she assured me that I would be very comfortable and yes it was the same. The treatment is still going on but believe me I am not at all scared of visiting that dental clinic. Thank you so much Dr Shivani.",

I had multiple cavities that need to be filled and one tooth needed root canal treatment. I could now understand the importance of healthy teeth when I was not able to eat comfortably.

I visited her, she took the x-ray and explained me the procedure and assured that it can definitely be done but might require two or three sittings as it was a difficult tooth to treat on. She completed the treatment in two sittings that too in a very comfortable manner. Thank you so much Dr Shivani.",

My pain was relieved and I was almost normal within two to three days. Thank you so much Dr Shivani.

I was a bit skeptical as the past root canal treatments were not that comfortable for me but she assured me that I would be very comfortable and yes it was the same.

I had multiple cavities that need to be filled and one tooth needed root canal treatment. I could now understand the importance of healthy teeth when I was not able to eat comfortably.

She started with scaling followed by composite filling for the gap in his upper front teeth. Watching her working with full dedication itself gives immense satisfaction. Have never seen someone doing such minute work. And yes, we were super happy with the results. She is the best.",

So She gave an appointment for the composite filling. I got the filling done. She told that if the filling gets chipped off again again, then other options will have to be done. Its almost an year. The filling is absolutely intact and natural. Kudos DrShivani.",
