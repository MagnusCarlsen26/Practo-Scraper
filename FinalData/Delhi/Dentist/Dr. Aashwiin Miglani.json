The periodontist on staff was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive to my needs, especially when it came to issues with gum coverage. The cleaning I received was also top-notch, leaving my teeth feeling fresh and healthy.\n\nBut what really stood out to me was the warmth and care shown by the doctors Aashwini Miglani and Smruti Miglani. They were both incredibly sweet and made me feel comfortable throughout my visit. I truly appreciated their attentiveness and compassion.\n\nAnd I have to mention the ambiance of Floss Dental Studio - it's truly the best I have seen in any dental clinic. The modern decor and soothing atmosphere immediately put me at ease, and I felt relaxed throughout my appointment.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Floss Dental Studio for anyone in need of dental care. The expertise of the staff, coupled with the caring and welcoming environment, make it a top-notch choice for anyone seeking dental services",

The results of the work he did were outstanding and surpassed my expectations.\n\nIn addition to his excellent clinical skills, Dr. Aashwiin had a great chairside manner and made me feel like a valued patient. The entire staff at the clinic was also friendly, welcoming, and professional, which made my experience even better.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend floss dental studio and dr Aashwiin  for anyone in need of dental implants, root canals, or crowns. He is an exceptional periodontist, and I am grateful to have had him as my dentist.",

All I can say is that the treatment was pain free\ud83d\ude0a, and performed to the highest level of proficiency. \nFloss Dental Studio is clean, well ventilated and has all the necessary precautions in place to ensure a safe and virus free environment. The pleasant addition to my experience was the classical music being played in the background which made this more like a relaxing visit to the spa rather than a dental appointment \ud83d\ude0c\nI would highly recommend Floss Dental Studio and Dr.Miglani and his wife, especially during this pandemic  when hygiene and sanitation is at the top of anyone's list when visiting a dentist.",

There is patience and perfection in his work and he will not give up unless he himself is satisfied.\n\nClinic is being sanitized and kept neat and clean. I would recommend him for any dental problems. You will thank me once you visit him.\n\nPadma Kannan",
