I did have problem in my wisdom teeth, and it has to be extracted.

I am posting this little bit late, as I wanna tell my complete experience from extraction to recovery. The extraction was done on 16 June 2022, and I felt OK as local anesthesia was given.

I had a better experience with the hospital (Kirpa Dental, West Patel Nagar), and the doctor (Dr. Sushan Sharma). Thank you doc, I feel better now‚Ä¶

I m a student nd I'm 26yrs old. One day I started feeling so much pain at right corner of my mouth ( initially I thought it would be some ulcer) nd then I consulted with Dr. Sushen, he did X ray nd I saw wisdom tooth was coming in opposite direction Then the doctor gave me medicine but I did not get relief from pain then
I went for wisdom tooth extraction but I had feared too. Dr. made me so calm and when the doctor started the procedure, no pain was felt for one and a half hours. Yes you will feel pressure during the procedure but there will be no pain at all. Throughout the process Dr. calming me too.  Today it's been 1 week and I am fine and no pain. One more thing, after surgery whenever I felt need he was just a call away. ",2023-06-01 14:41:28,False,True,Verified Patient,"Thank you for your kind and honest words üôè
