None,"Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES," I never thought of writing a review for Dr Shikha, but felt compulsion to do so when I realised quality of dental treatment I got from her.  She suggested me to go for root canal on my 5 teeth which were damaged by deep cavities. I opted for treatment but got only 3 root canal done on my choice and thought of getting other two done later. I got these treated too at a dentist close to my place, as I never felt anything great about my first 3 root canal treatment.
A year later I developed pain in that side of treatment and I was advised a CT scan by my second dentist. I got my CT done and all my root canals were evaluated. The CT guy told me “He has rarely seen such high quality root canal treatment on CBCT”, he was referring to root canals done by Dr Shikha and suggested my other two root canals has failed and there was pus formation and that the procedure was done incompletely.
Not left with a choice I went back to Dr Shikha, got root canal again on my two teeth and realized the instruments and equipment used by her were not seen at my second dentist, leave away the facility of root canal under microscope. Every five minutes in procedure a new fancy instrument was used, and she never hesitated to explain the utility of these gadgets.
Charges too were only marginally higher than my other dentist, but I don’t want to pay again for choosing someone who is not expert. All through my second visit Shikha mam never commented or said anything about my second dentist. She is a very humble, dedicated, and very advanced dental specialist and she will definitely add some “wow” in her signature treatment style.

None,None,0,0,YES,"My problem was I felt little pain on my molar tooth. Also I saw it was a bit loose.
At age of 24, Is it my milk tooth or my permanent tooth. I don't know.
I asked my friend and was advised to see a doctor.

I read a lot of articles and watched youtube videos before making this decision to actually visit the doctor. It filled my mind with too many questions.

Questions like:
1. I came to know even after doing brush regularly one can develop gum disease.
2. Gum disease is caused due to depositions on teeth actually on those places where toothbrush don't reach. Gum disease affects gums and eventually you loose that tooth forever.
You are left with a void that is a permanent.

Most important question:
How can you enjoy your favourite food without teeth?

I browsed for symptoms for gum disease that were like
1. bleeding gums
2. bad breath
3. loose teeth
4. puffy gums

Still not sure I had little pain in my molar teeth then and now plus it is a bit loose.
It is good if you act early.

So I visited this doctor. She handled me very politely. I had many questions in my mind and I got all of them answered.

She checked my tooth and told the gums are in good condition. My molar tooth is being hold fine by my gums. My case is of sensitivity. I have lost my enamel on the molar tooth and that was a shock for me. It is maybe because of crushing my teeth one against the other.

Also one must also not brush hard because you want your teeth to shine. It is because of the deposits that harden over time. If you brush hard you will lose enamel that is given just once by the mother nature.

She told me if you can do anything now is remove the deposits that is a machine cleaning process by the doctor. One must approach for this cleaning every 6 months or one year.

This ensures
1. keeps in check the deposits on teeth unreachable by tooth brush.
2. deposits on check means decreasing the chances of gum diseases and subsequently fear of loosing your precious tooth.

Visiting the doctor was fruitful because I came to know:
1. I don't have any kind of gum disease.
2. The tooth I am having right now are all permanent and I should not expect any tooth to  sprout out if I loose any of my tooth.
3. My case of sensitivity and valuable information so I could prevent my teeth from further damage caused due to my ignorance in first place.

We are sorry to hear that you are having discomfort after getting filling done from us. The level of filling was thoroughly checked before you left clinic, however sometimes even after leaving the clinic some patients (like in your case) may discover a high point in area where the filling was done. This is in most probability causing you difficulty in chewing from left side. There is no need for you to worry or fear going to any other dentist, any of them can fix this. We would request you to visit us again, we will be happy to attend you and take care of your problems.",2018-07-26T10:09:46+0000,Dr. Shikha Goel
