Since 2017, your clinic has been our go-to place for all our dental needs, and every visit has only reinforced our trust in your expertise and professionalism. Your humble and caring demeanor, coupled with the genuine concern you show for your patients, sets you apart in the field of dentistry.

I will never forget the time when I was hit by a ball on my face and was in immense discomfort. Despite visiting several doctors who couldn't diagnose my problem, you were able to pinpoint the issue and treat it with the utmost patience and skill. Your ability to listen attentively and your dedication to finding the right solution truly made a world of difference for me.

Beyond your exceptional clinical skills, it's your kindness and willingness to go above and beyond that truly make you stand out. 

Thank you once again for everything you do. I feel truly fortunate to have you as my dentist, and I look forward to many more years of receiving outstanding care from you and your team.

"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,","Dental Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I would have chosen ""can't say"" if there was such an option. For most of the cases I could easily recommend Doctor Sachin but I happened to have bad luck to be a patient of him who faced some painful experience just 1 month after leaving his clinic because of some negligence from his part.

I applied for the full Orthodontist treatment for Braces from Dr. Sachin. He was great in beginning but after that when whole world went into COVID I was not able to visit him at the time of the appointments but still kept on wearing retainers.

For the last step of the process Dr. Sachin told me that he will do the scaling to remove the sediments he put on the teeth to fix the wires and also adjust the gaps if there were some.

But when I went to him after COVID he didn't even mention both of them and told me that to fix the gaps there will be a need of some new process which will cost extra. He did a complete checkup and told me that everything is fine, and that he will not do anything more for my braces treatment and that anything more will be for only cosmetic reasons.

I was fine with that. And decided to give him 4 stars as I was fine with some small gaps. But fast forward a month I can see that I was quite hasty to even have that opinion.

Since he didn't do the final adjustments and didn't do a proper checkup a small gap not visible to me was left between the top right molars. It was such a small gap that even toothbrush didn't went there. It was created during the braces treatment and now I got a cavity in there. Even at the time of the writing I have it and have scheduled another dentist to fix it.

Not only that, Dr. Sachin did a complete checkup and charged me for it. But he didn't even check the lower right wisdom teeth. It had not come out properly and there is still some tissue over it. He told me everything is fine, but this week I got an infection there. And after visiting a similarly qualified Dentist I was shocked to know that there was a cavity there. Now there will be a need to not only cut the tissue and get the Wisdom tooth out but also to see how damaging this cavity is.

I came to know about the SR Dental implants because of our family doctor. Uncle treated me with so much expertise that I still remember his treatments, Dr Sachin is his Nephew and he claimed that he will be a professional and family friendly just like him, and he was, only in the beginning. Now only after a month of visiting to him from Haryana I am getting to know that there were two critical cavities in my mouth. I thought that proper brushing and regular check-ups were enough for my dental hygiene but now it seems that I was naive to put all my confidence in him.

In the end first I thought to rate his clinic 5 stars, then 4, and now 1 or even less than 1. He was unprofessional in his last checkup and I am really surprised on how can he miss not one but two cavities, he could have seen one just by blowing some air on the tissue over the wisdom tooth. But I guess there was no need of doing that from his point of view.

Honestly, I would not have any bad feelings toward him if I faced these complications a year or so after the last checkup as I could only take it as my fault for not showing up for a regular checkup. This issue could have been resolved peacefully if Doctor Sachin had a little more due diligence. I would not have felt so much pain for days and he would not have got a bad review.

My review may be a minority one. Maybe the only 1 star review. Many must have liked him and went home happy. But let my review remind you all that he is not perfect like everyone of us and can make some gross mistakes which can harm you in long run. And for me, I am scheduled for a surgery tomorrow, let's see what happens.

Edit: Had some communication with Doctor Sachin and can say that this was just an unfortunate case. My case will be in minority. In most of the cases you will get no problem at all, I guess it was my bad luck that he made a small negligence which also had a small probability with the doctor of his calibre and knowledge.",2022-12-21 10:18:04,False,True,Anubhav Sharma,,,
