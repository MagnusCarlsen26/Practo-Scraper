"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Bleeding Gums Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I was suffering from sore, inflammed, red, and bleeding gums. My gum linings and teeth surfaces were covered with hard calculus deposits and my mouth was a harbor for those troublesome bacteria, causing bad breath. My gums started to recede and became so tender that they used to bleed with any little exertion I did. I was in a precarious situation and had to take a step as early as possible. That's when I decided to visit Delhi Dental Studio and consult Dr. Surpreet Bhandari, having researched about her extensive expertise in periodontal treatments. In the first visit itself, I was convinced I had taken the right decision. She explained my problem thoroughly and informed me about the elaborate plan to cure my disease from its root. In 3 sittings, each a week apart, she progressively treated my condition, starting from scaling and advancing to deep gum cleaning combined with LASER powered contouring. At no point, it felt I was hastily dealt with, thanks to the proper pre-planned weekly appointments and that gave my gums enough time to heal. The equipments and machines were modern and the clinic was hygienic with sanitation in check. I am fully satisfied with my experience here and really wish I had found this gem of a clinic even earlier.",2024-04-02 15:14:29,False,True,Sanchit Kapoor,,,
