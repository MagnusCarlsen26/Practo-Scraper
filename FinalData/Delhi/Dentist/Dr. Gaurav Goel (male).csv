When asked over the longivity of the fillings, he said there is no minimum or maximum limit. Well that was ok, but the way he responded it seem as if he is totally unconcerned even if the fillings go out very next day.

My wife had a tooth decay and paining a little and asked him to check. He checked and told there is no option but to take teeth out surgically. When asked about another alternative, he said No. **** ***** ** ******* ******* ** **** **** **** ** ** *** **** ******
