There are several things which I want to appreciate and mentioning some of those here. First of all, I want to thank Dr. Subhima Bhalla for the ********* treatment of my son, which was totally painless with appropriate consultation. The best part was Doctor's friendlyness with the child and my son became ready for his sensitive tooth treatment due to this. Doctor is very humble, patient centric, good listener and very courteous. I would recommend to others if they are looking for right solution for their child's dental problem, you can have a visit to experience the same, many thanks Dr. Subhima",

There are several things which I want to appreciate and mentioning some of those here. First of all, I want to thank Dr. Subhima Bhalla for the ********* treatment of my son, which was totally painless with appropriate consultation. The best part was Doctor's friendlyness with the child and my son became ready for his sensitive tooth treatment due to this. Doctor is very humble, patient centric, good listener and very courteous. I would recommend to others if they are looking for right solution for their child's dental problem, you can have a visit to experience the same, many thanks Dr. Subhima",
