His kind and supportive approach made all the difference from the moment I walked into his clinic with a dental emergency. Dr. Sanjay, evaluated my dental issues with immense care and had a very positive attitude, clearly explaining the diagnosis and treatment plan step by step. His ability to make me feel comfortable and understood was unparalleled, and I\u2019ve never felt so good and relieved at a dentist\u2019s office before.\n\nDr. Kumar's approach reminded me that overcoming fear is the first step to achieving good health. I am now looking forward to my dental treatment with a newfound confidence, thanks to Dr. Sanjay Kumar & his team.\n\nHis dedication to patient care & counseling is truly inspiring, and I am grateful for his help in taking this important step towards better dental health.\n\nBest Regards\nRicha",

I connected with him on video call . Following which Dr Sanjay proactively communicated with my doctors and dentists in UK via zoom calls and constantly gave me feedback and treatment route.\nI was very impressed by his knowledge,  communication and ability to advise my doctors in UK too.\nI finally arrived in Delhi and Dr Sanjay helped me with Blood tests, Scans, explained in detail the full process and always had the time for a quick chat about the surgical process. He was absolutely Brilliant. I have now completed my surgery and aftercare process which too only 10 days . I will be back to Delhi in a couple of months and am looking forward to good dental health and brand new teeth.",

They've got (what my untrained eye finds to be) good equipment, and I now have a new crown, and a bar-coded card with a 10 year replacement warranty to keep me at ease.\r\n\r\n10/10 will be getting checkups from him whenever I'm in town.",

I also read many positive reviews online so I decided to schedule an appointment to fix the enamel erosion on my upper molar tooth. I visited Dr. Kumar's dental clinic in Greater Kailash-1 and was impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities and the cleanliness. After a quick examination, Dr. Kumar explained the problem to me and fixed the enamel erosion within no time. He has a friendly, solution-centric approach which makes patients feel comfortable. He also went out of his way to answer all my questions and clear any doubts that I had. The thing that impressed me most about Dr. Kumar is that he doesn't increase the number of sittings just to make extra money - something which most dentists do nowadays. Customer satisfaction is the only thing that matters to him. I would definitely recommend Dr. Kumar to anyone looking for a good dentist.",

He dint go overboard about doing this and that unlike commercial dentists  but guided how in the least non invasive way can the procedure be done without teasing the teeth . Highly recommended.",

His kind and supportive approach made all the difference from the moment I walked into his clinic with a dental emergency. Dr. Sanjay, evaluated my dental issues with immense care and had a very positive attitude, clearly explaining the diagnosis and treatment plan step by step. His ability to make me feel comfortable and understood was unparalleled, and I\u2019ve never felt so good and relieved at a dentist\u2019s office before.\n\nDr. Kumar's approach reminded me that overcoming fear is the first step to achieving good health. I am now looking forward to my dental treatment with a newfound confidence, thanks to Dr. Sanjay Kumar & his team.\n\nHis dedication to patient care & counseling is truly inspiring, and I am grateful for his help in taking this important step towards better dental health.\n\nBest Regards\nRicha",

I connected with him on video call . Following which Dr Sanjay proactively communicated with my doctors and dentists in UK via zoom calls and constantly gave me feedback and treatment route.\nI was very impressed by his knowledge,  communication and ability to advise my doctors in UK too.\nI finally arrived in Delhi and Dr Sanjay helped me with Blood tests, Scans, explained in detail the full process and always had the time for a quick chat about the surgical process. He was absolutely Brilliant. I have now completed my surgery and aftercare process which too only 10 days . I will be back to Delhi in a couple of months and am looking forward to good dental health and brand new teeth.",

They've got (what my untrained eye finds to be) good equipment, and I now have a new crown, and a bar-coded card with a 10 year replacement warranty to keep me at ease.\r\n\r\n10/10 will be getting checkups from him whenever I'm in town.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Kumar was recommended to me by my family members, who are his regular clients. I also read many positive reviews online so I decided to schedule an appointment to fix the enamel erosion on my upper molar tooth. I visited Dr. Kumar's dental clinic in Greater Kailash-1 and was impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities and the cleanliness. After a quick examination, Dr. Kumar explained the problem to me and fixed the enamel erosion within no time. He has a friendly, solution-centric approach which makes patients feel comfortable. He also went out of his way to answer all my questions and clear any doubts that I had. The thing that impressed me most about Dr. Kumar is that he doesn't increase the number of sittings just to make extra money - something which most dentists do nowadays. Customer satisfaction is the only thing that matters to him. I would definitely recommend Dr. Kumar to anyone looking for a good dentist.",

He dint go overboard about doing this and that unlike commercial dentists  but guided how in the least non invasive way can the procedure be done without teasing the teeth . Highly recommended.",
