"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My advice - do not think twice, just visit the clinic if you're looking for a dentist! 

A couple months late, but I think this review would be helpful for the ones worried about the aftermath of RCT. The services that Mrs. Archana and Mr. Abhishek provided me were impeccable. They make you feel like home with their gentle and kind nature, and explain to you each and every detail patiently. The staff is extremely friendly and the clinic is well maintained. After RCT, I'm able to chew like before, and the cap doesn't even feel like it's there at all! My tooth looks absolutely real and I'm extremely happy with the results of the RCT. 

Most importantly, since a lot of people are afraid of getting an RCT done, I can vouch that the procedure was pretty much painless for me. They're absolute experts and just know what they're doing! 

I hope this review clears all your worries and helps you make a decision for yourself.  ^_^",2022-09-12 17:32:31,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
