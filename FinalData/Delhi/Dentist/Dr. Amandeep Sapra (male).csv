And for my friend he did permanent filling and never told us to get the cap , after few months the filling came out and when we call him to complain he replied in a very not good manner that if the filling will keeps on coming out then I am not going to fill it for free ,and also told us that you should give the measurement for the cap that time only as he is not responsible for the patient once the patient is end up paying the whole money to him

Just checked your records
A filling never stays in a root canaled tooth for long and we include in the basic root canal treatment and is never charged extra 

We take extra effort to educate our patients 
That getting a cap is an integral part of the root canal Patient , but sadly majority of cases don‚Äôt follow up

And come back with a missed filling 

It doesn‚Äôt fall on the doctor
If the patient is not following 
Up . Inspire of all the education , instruction and follow up

Also we have done a complimentary service of the filling 
So please value that
