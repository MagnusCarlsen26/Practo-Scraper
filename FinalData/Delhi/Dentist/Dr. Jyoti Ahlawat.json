The digital radiograph has been emailed at the mail id mentioned by you in your patient registration form. We tried reaching you on the phone number that you provided via practo portal while booking appointment and at time of registration process with our staff, however despite numerous attempts at our end, the number stayed switched off /unavailable. We would also like to mention that despite multiple requests by our staff to wear shoe cover inside operatory area for disinfection & hygiene purposes, u chose to ignore that and walked in the surgical operatory with your slippers on a rainy day. We understand it can be challenging for a patient due to past dental experiences over a decade ago to understand the scientific difference between an IOPA X-ray where you are provided the x ray film and a digital format of imaging like RVG, however you insisted on a physical copy of X-ray while arguing and shouting at our front desk staff and at the attending doctor in front of other patients. This happens to be a significant event that we take very seriously since it compromises the dental environment for patients who are awaiting their treatment after you. We hope you give us a chance to improve your experience next time. Have a good day.",

The digital radiograph has been emailed at the mail id mentioned by you in your patient registration form. We tried reaching you on the phone number that you provided via practo portal while booking appointment and at time of registration process with our staff, however despite numerous attempts at our end, the number stayed switched off /unavailable. We would also like to mention that despite multiple requests by our staff to wear shoe cover inside operatory area for disinfection & hygiene purposes, u chose to ignore that and walked in the surgical operatory with your slippers on a rainy day. We understand it can be challenging for a patient due to past dental experiences over a decade ago to understand the scientific difference between an IOPA X-ray where you are provided the x ray film and a digital format of imaging like RVG, however you insisted on a physical copy of X-ray while arguing and shouting at our front desk staff and at the attending doctor in front of other patients. This happens to be a significant event that we take very seriously since it compromises the dental environment for patients who are awaiting their treatment after you. We hope you give us a chance to improve your experience next time. Have a good day.",

My treatment was done painlessly & gently. I am happy and satisfied with their services",

Everyone there make you feel so comfortable that all your fears just vanishes. The way Doctor gives you all the available options for your problem and then the detailed explanation of the chosen procedure is just incredible. In these tough times of COVID-19 they are also making sure that all the necessary measures are being taken not only for their own but also for their patient\u2019s safety too. One more thing which caught my attention was that they are also giving online consultation. Overall had a great experience and would definitely suggest that \u201cThe Tooth Dental and Orofacial Clinic \u201c is one of the best solution for all your Dental conditions.",

My friend Who stays in noida suggested me to visit Dr Ahlawat and when I searched at Practo I found her profile very impressive. I like the concept that every dental condition is being dealt by specific dentist expert in treating that condition.  Dr Jyoti suggested me Invisalign Ortho treatment for my teeth. It\u2019s little expensivebut nothing good comes free. I opted for EMI facility . I would say it\u2019s so comfortable",

Doctors explain the dental problems in detail with parents after taking pictures of teeth and  digital x rays. I love how organised and clear they're at each stage.
