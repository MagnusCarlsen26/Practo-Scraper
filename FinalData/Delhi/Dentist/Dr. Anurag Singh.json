Throughout my entire dental experience at SCODE, my fears and anxiety were overpowered by the professionalism and care by both Dr Anurag & Dr Megna Singh. They took extreme caution to allay my fears and would always inform and educate me before they start all procedures. At every stage of the root canal treatment, they would also take extreme care to have X-rays taken to ensure that all are in order. \r\n\r\nWith improvements in technology, there will always be better dental equipments offered in the industry but professional dental treatments that are personalised and delivered by passionate and dedicated dentists are rare.Throughout the period of my treatment, I was blessed to receive their undivided attention and care. \r\n\r\nAs I had specifically flown in for this dental treatment, there were many instances where Dr Meghna had to dedicate the entire day for me.Given the magnitude of my treatments, it was extremely time and cost efficient for me as the same Quality treatment would have taken me so much longer and cost so much more in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHence , I would strongly recommend both Dr Anurag & Dr Meghna Singh and their team at SCODE.\r\n\r\nKudos to the team at SCODE.",

I had already gone through multiple jaw correction surgeries however my problem was never rested and therefore I started my research to find the best doctor to get this surgery done for one last time and I'm I am so glad that I did my research and chose his practice. \r\n\r\nIn a time when medical care has increasingly been more about running a business than about patient care, you and Dr. Meghna are an outstanding example of why the field of healthcare need doctors like you. Your skills and experience is what sets you and your team apart from so many professionals today. I have recently moved to Australia but if I ever need any dental medicare I  would travel to India to get his expertise, he is simply the BEST!\r\n\r\nI will happily refer anyone that needs oral surgery to Dr. Anurag. Thank you again, and I wish you and your team all the success in future.\r\n\r\nHarpal Singh\r\nharpalsingh.in@outlook.com\r\nIndia: 9888 502 502 | AUS: 0452 405 720\r\n",

                "review_text": "I have been visiting Dr. Anurag since 2012, and I  always feel I am in safe hands during my treatment. I feel nothing will go wrong in my treatment once I am treated by  Dr. Anurag. I have so much faith in him, so much so that I visit him all the way from Dharamsala, though there are implant centers and dentists everywhere in my locality these days. But I make this nightlong bus journey to Delhi every time I have any dental problems. He helps me gain confidence in my work as a  teacher.  I owe him much gratitude. Thank you Dr. Anurag! May you live long to benefit thousands of suffering beings like me!",

Throughout my entire dental experience at SCODE, my fears and anxiety were overpowered by the professionalism and care by both Dr Anurag & Dr Megna Singh. They took extreme caution to allay my fears and would always inform and educate me before they start all procedures. At every stage of the root canal treatment, they would also take extreme care to have X-rays taken to ensure that all are in order. \r\n\r\nWith improvements in technology, there will always be better dental equipments offered in the industry but professional dental treatments that are personalised and delivered by passionate and dedicated dentists are rare.Throughout the period of my treatment, I was blessed to receive their undivided attention and care. \r\n\r\nAs I had specifically flown in for this dental treatment, there were many instances where Dr Meghna had to dedicate the entire day for me.Given the magnitude of my treatments, it was extremely time and cost efficient for me as the same Quality treatment would have taken me so much longer and cost so much more in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHence , I would strongly recommend both Dr Anurag & Dr Meghna Singh and their team at SCODE.\r\n\r\nKudos to the team at SCODE.",

I had already gone through multiple jaw correction surgeries however my problem was never rested and therefore I started my research to find the best doctor to get this surgery done for one last time and I'm I am so glad that I did my research and chose his practice. \r\n\r\nIn a time when medical care has increasingly been more about running a business than about patient care, you and Dr. Meghna are an outstanding example of why the field of healthcare need doctors like you. Your skills and experience is what sets you and your team apart from so many professionals today. I have recently moved to Australia but if I ever need any dental medicare I  would travel to India to get his expertise, he is simply the BEST!\r\n\r\nI will happily refer anyone that needs oral surgery to Dr. Anurag. Thank you again, and I wish you and your team all the success in future.\r\n\r\nHarpal Singh\r\nharpalsingh.in@outlook.com\r\nIndia: 9888 502 502 | AUS: 0452 405 720\r\n",

He spent a considerable time explaining to me, with the help of drawings and a 3 D skull model, how the jaw works and where and why there is a limitation in my jaw movement.  He also provided some insights on how to treat the ailment. I would recommend highly a consultation with Dr Anurag if you are suffering from a TMJ disorder.",
