I was in immense pain which suddenly started in my second last tooth and she was immediately able to identify the problem and started my treatment. Dr. Ruchir drained an abscess  and then she continued the remaining treatment. I had to go another 3 appointments to complete the treatment. Everything was quite painless and now I am totally fine. I only wish I had kept coming to her for my regular checkups and this unnecessary problem would never have happened then.

I was expecting that she will prescribe some medicine so I feel less pain until root canal is done.",2018-10-02 05:14:12,False,False,Verified Patient,"Dear Sir..Please note that your observations are completely unfair and not representative of the correct facts. 
Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, we have not suggested any root canal for you. Secondly, and more importantly, we do not give a prescription of medications to each and every patient we see. Prescriptions for medications are only given where we feel they are absolutely required and the medications are unavoidable. India in particular, and the world in general, has been fighting the menace of unnecessary and indiscriminate prescription of medications for a long time now. The side effects of such random medications like pain-killers and/ or antibiotics can create multiple short and long-term issues for patients at large. Hence, it is the moral duty of every ethical clinician to limit the use of medicine prescriptions to only where it is needed. We are proud that we uphold this principle and almost all our patients love us for that. The Consultation Fee (and that fee is clearly displayed on the Practo portal from where you booked your appointment) you pay is for our Consultation and Opinion regarding your problem and its management..no textbook of medicine or dentistry says that you must write medicines for every patient who comes to see you. And just for your information, it is far easier and more time-saving to quickly write a list of medicines and send the patient away, rather than actually explaining the problem to him and telling him why medicines are not needed for the time being and what is the best way to manage the situation.
Thirdly, because of the strict standards of sterilization we maintain and the protocols we rigidly follow, we are often able to limit the use of prescription medications to a large extent which actually works to the patient's advantage both in the short and long-term. So, that again actually increases our workload, but eventually makes us happier and our patients healthier.
Fourthly, your saying that we don't give prescriptions to anyone is again an incorrect generalization. We see a number of patients every day. And we have been doing so for quite a few years now. Do you really think any clinician can actually treat all problems without ever giving prescriptions?..Of course not. So, we do give prescriptions..but only when we feel patients really need it..
Finally, you say that you took time time to find our clinic. Well, we are sorry but cant really help with that. Maybe you found it difficult because it was your first visit. But, so many of our patients from different parts of Delhi and NCR region, as well as different parts of India and even abroad are able to reach us at our address.
Sir..In today's times it is not easy to stick to ideal principles of practice. We try and make our best efforts to do what is right for our patients without succumbing to short-cuts (like writing needless prescriptions) or worrying about other irrelevant considerations. We regret the fact that you found this approach incorrect. But we would like to reassure you that we have nothing but your best interests in mind. Your heath and well-being, and that of all our patients, is sacred to us. We are here to do a job and we are always hopeful that in doing the job to the best of our abilities, it also makes us popular with our patients (which to a very large extent it does).  But even if doing the right thing brings us some unpopularity, then so be it. We are here to do what is right for you and all our patients, and we shall not give that up for anything (not even our popularity). 
Hope you can see things in better light now. Wishing you good luck and good health. God Bless!",2018-10-13T07:17:54+0000,Dr. Sony Mishra

"Value for money,","Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,",0,0,NO,"Clinic was so unclean but still there prices are touching the sky .
Will never recommend to anyone. *** ***** ***** ** *** ***** **** *",2020-01-07 06:40:32,False,False,Verified Patient,"This is a completely unfair and unfounded feedback. You talk about our prices when you only visited us for a Consultation. Before your visit, you had already had a long and detailed conversation with us and we helped you as much as we could without charging you a penny for that. You even wanted a precise treatment plan on the phone which we said could only be possible after we examined a few things. You already knew about your Consultation Fees (which is the only payment you ever made to us). If you thought even our Consultation Fees was high, you could have chosen to not visit us. 
And the clinic cleanliness bit of course appears like an afterthought. No one in all these years of our practice has ever had anything adverse to say on that account. We only hope you are fair and honest in your assessment. God Bless and Stay Healthy!",2020-09-15T17:49:58+0000,Dr. Sony Mishra
