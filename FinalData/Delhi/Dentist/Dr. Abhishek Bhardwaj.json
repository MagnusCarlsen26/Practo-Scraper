The services that Mrs. Archana and Mr. Abhishek provided me were impeccable. They make you feel like home with their gentle and kind nature, and explain to you each and every detail patiently. The staff is extremely friendly and the clinic is well maintained. After RCT, I'm able to chew like before, and the cap doesn't even feel like it's there at all! My tooth looks absolutely real and I'm extremely happy with the results of the RCT. \n\nMost importantly, since a lot of people are afraid of getting an RCT done, I can vouch that the procedure was pretty much painless for me. They're absolute experts and just know what they're doing! \n\nI hope this review clears all your worries and helps you make a decision for yourself.  ^_^",

You complained of cavities, pain in your molar and had impacted wisdom teeth. All these necessitate dental x-rays.  In fact, after viewing the same, we advised you not to initiate root canal therapy immediately. But as it was your first dental visit ever, you might not have appreciated the same. \nAlso, the need and prices were explained to you. Only after your consent, did we go ahead with the same. You also insisted on taking your x-rays before making an online payment, which we still haven't received. \nWe hope future sessions at other centers might clear your confusion. Wish you the very best.",
