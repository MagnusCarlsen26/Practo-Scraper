,,0,0,NO,"Dr. Sachdeva did my teeth implant treatment.I wasn't happy with the treatment. They weren't organised, constantly delayed my appointments. The treatment that needed 5 sittings was delayed to a whole month.",2023-04-11 03:23:13,False,False,Verified Patient,"Sincere apologies Sìr/ Ma’am for the delay. The 5 appointments were distributed over the month as the lab suggests. Many a times the complexity of the procedure take number of visits to make sure the crowns or bridges of hybrid prosthesis are passive and a good fit, which is essential for the longevity of prosthesis. It’s not in our hand to reduce the time frame, if a dental laboratory is asking for numerous trials. Still we apologise for the inconvenience caused. Enjoy your teeth for a long time to come. God bless",2023-04-11T08:18:31+0000,Dr. Akash Sachdeva
