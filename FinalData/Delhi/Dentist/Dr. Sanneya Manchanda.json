Dr. Sanneya not only saved my teeth but has explained and taught me how to continue to maintain them m. I got 1 implant and a Bridge and scaling done from her absolutely painless n so comfortably that now going to a dentist doesn\u2019t seem scary at all. Very professional and articulate with her work  made my smile absolutely priceless. I strongly recommend her to everyone. ",

It\u2019s worth it to visit her for any tooth related problems , she is well experienced and makes sure we get cured at the earliest.

She took the time to explain the procedure to me in detail, and her friendly demeanor immediately put me at ease. During the treatment, she displayed the utmost professionalism, skill, and attention to detail, which made me feel confident that I was in good hands.\nHowever, what really sets her apart from other dentists is her commitment to following up with her patients during and after the treatment to ensure they are doing well. Not many doctors take the time to do that, and I really appreciate the personal touch she brings to your practice.\nOverall, I highly recommend her services to anyone looking for a skilled and compassionate dentist. I thank her for the excellent care she provided, and I look forward to visiting her clinic again in the future.",

I taught the root canal treatment is done and I would never have a pain on this tooth again. 2 months ago, I had an infection in the gum of the same tooth. Since, lockdown was going on, I couldn't visit any dentist. I took some medicines from the pharmacy. The infection was heald, but there was black marks on my gum. 2 weeks ago I visited Dr. Sanneya for consultation. She took an x-ray and unfortunately she informed me that the pervious root canal treatment was failed. So she recommended me to do retreatment ASAP. I started the retreatment of root canaling on my teeth with Dr. Sanneya and now as she said it is perfectly done and it will never cause any pain. \nDr. Sanneya acts very professionally meanwhile friendly.

I found her to be very professional and truly caring about your oral health.She goes  above and beyond the call of duty to make sure you understand what you should do with your teeth and mouth so you do not have future health risks.\nHaven't seen any doctor following up with their patients to bring them at ease and ensuring them that the treatment went of well.Hats off!!!!!\n",

Due to covid aftermath I was diagnosed with diabetes which I turn had affected my teeth. A complete jaw rehabilitation had to be done, I was told to get 5 implants but a couple of dentists which not only scared me but the expense was very high, and then she happened and everything changed. Dr. Sanneya not only saved my teeth but has explained and taught me how to continue to maintain them m. I got 1 implant and a Bridge and scaling done from her absolutely painless n so comfortably that now going to a dentist doesn\u2019t seem scary at all. Very professional and articulate with her work  made my smile absolutely priceless. I strongly recommend her to everyone. ",

The treatment is painless , it\u2019s just that day one you might experience some discomfort or pain after that everything is taken care of. It\u2019s worth it to visit her for any tooth related problems , she is well experienced and makes sure we get cured at the earliest.

She took the time to explain the procedure to me in detail, and her friendly demeanor immediately put me at ease. During the treatment, she displayed the utmost professionalism, skill, and attention to detail, which made me feel confident that I was in good hands.\nHowever, what really sets her apart from other dentists is her commitment to following up with her patients during and after the treatment to ensure they are doing well. Not many doctors take the time to do that, and I really appreciate the personal touch she brings to your practice.\nOverall, I highly recommend her services to anyone looking for a skilled and compassionate dentist. I thank her for the excellent care she provided, and I look forward to visiting her clinic again in the future.",

I taught the root canal treatment is done and I would never have a pain on this tooth again. 2 months ago, I had an infection in the gum of the same tooth. Since, lockdown was going on, I couldn't visit any dentist. I took some medicines from the pharmacy. The infection was heald, but there was black marks on my gum. 2 weeks ago I visited Dr. Sanneya for consultation. She took an x-ray and unfortunately she informed me that the pervious root canal treatment was failed. So she recommended me to do retreatment ASAP. I started the retreatment of root canaling on my teeth with Dr. Sanneya and now as she said it is perfectly done and it will never cause any pain. \nDr. Sanneya acts very professionally meanwhile friendly. Thanks ",

I found her to be very professional and truly caring about your oral health.She goes  above and beyond the call of duty to make sure you understand what you should do with your teeth and mouth so you do not have future health risks.\nHaven't seen any doctor following up with their patients to bring them at ease and ensuring them that the treatment went of well.Hats off!!!!!\n",

She is young and with full of energy to actually save your teeth rather than just doing some costly treatment. She takes you through every step while conducting the treatment and makes you feel safe and comfortable. I was scared of dentists and only went once to a dentist until I found Dr Sanneya and want her to be my permanent doctor no matter whichever place I stay in. Another good thing about Dr. Sanneya is that she'll take constant follow ups with you during the process of the treatment and personally makes sure you are fine is also available at anytime you need her. A humble yet very smart doctor with extensive knowledge on the field. Will suggest anyone and everyone who stays in South Delhi to definitely go to her if with any tooth problems. ",
