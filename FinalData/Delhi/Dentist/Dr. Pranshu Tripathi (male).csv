He is a true gentleman and professional. I live in Toronto and was not satisfied with the services and attention given by local doctors there. I saw JR Dental clinic reviews online and immediately connected to Dr. Pranshu, who is very friendly and knowledgable in his field. It felt like I am talking to my best friend. He not only gave me correct advice, but also helped me understand the problem well and designed a future roadmap/action plan by which I can have excellent dental health. I flew down to Dwarka, New Delhi especially to get treated by him. I would strongly recommend JR Dental clinic, Dr. Avantika and Dr. Pranshu.. for patient not only in india, however outside india and living in abroad.
