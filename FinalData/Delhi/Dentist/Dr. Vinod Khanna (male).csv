"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dear Dr. Vinod Khanna

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible care you have provided me in resolving my teeth problem that had plagued me for the past 20 years. Words cannot express how much your expertise and dedication have meant to me.

For two decades, I lived with several teeth issues. It caused me not only physical discomfort but also affected my confidence and self-esteem. I had consulted several dentists over the years, but none were able to provide a lasting solution.

Then I came to your practice, and everything changed. From the very first consultation, I felt a sense of hope and trust. You took the time to listen carefully to my concerns, thoroughly examine my teeth, and explain all the treatment options available in a clear and understandable way.

I was particularly impressed by the gentle touch, meticulous attention to detail, willingness to answer all my questions. You made me feel comfortable and confident throughout the entire treatment process.

And the results? They are nothing short of miraculous! Root Canal treatment my teeth are finally healthy, pain-free, and look absolutely amazing. I can smile with confidence again, and I can eat all the foods I used to avoid. It's truly a life-changing transformation.

Thank you, Dr. Vinod Khanna, for giving me back my smile and my confidence. You are a truly gifted dentist, and I am so grateful to have found you.

Sincerely,
