"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I have been to several dentists since childhood since I had to wear braces twice over, and it's safe to say that my surgical experience at Dave dental clinic was the best by far. Deep rooted wisdom tooth surgical extraction was one of the most complicated procedures (even according to statistical records of such cases) with a long post op care and recovery time. The surgery done by Dr. Adithya Kwatra and Dr. Dave was smooth with extreme sensitivity to keep me mentally prepared for any pain that was to be anticipated. Guidance through the procedure is very important for any patient who is under local anaesthesia and knows what's going on during the surgery. That guidance was key to a satisfactory procedure for me. Furthermore, the support throughout post op care was amazing. I could text Dr. Dave at any point in time and he would revert with his advice as promptly as he could. 

I would strongly recommend Dr. Dave for the affordable dental care as well. The procedure I got done was charged 1/3rd at his clinic as compared to others. He was very frank about the affordablity he provides even with his consultation fee, which is only Rs. 200!
