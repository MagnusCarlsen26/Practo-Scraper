"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I had an angulated wisdom tooth which had started to barge into my molar and it hurt my entire jaw. 

I visited Dr. Aman on a Saturday. He had an immediate extraction plan. Took an x-ray, showed it to me and asked what I wanted to do. He inquired if I'd like to save it while just filling the cavity or get it removed. I chose the later. So, we started and in about an hour I left with a smile.

The best bits were:
‚Ä¢Minimal pain (I thanked him for it)
‚Ä¢He asked me, during the procedure, if I knew that he had removed the tooth (which I didn't), so I smiled back. 
‚Ä¢I called him at 11:30 p.m. the same day about a concern and he very calmly explained to me what I needed to know.
‚Ä¢No waiting (First visit to him ever; called first).


In a week now, I'm stitches free and pain free.
The only thing you need to worry about is the cost, which depends on the procedure. Since I went under a surgical removal, it cost a bit but looking at the experience I had, it was worth every penny.

I even asked the doc if I could have a copy of my x-ray and he mailed it to me, and even called to confirm if I had received it!

Overall, a brilliant experience of an apparently painful wisdom tooth extraction (which it wasn't; discomfort, sure).
