Ever since, I have been going to Dr. Ojha for most of my dental treatment; which is attributable to the following reasons:- 

Firstly, Dr. Ojha is that he takes the trouble to explain the issue at hand to his patient in detail; and thereafter, suggests a line of dental treatment only after giving his reasons for the same. 

Secondly, at no stage did Dr. Ojha ever refuse to answer, or even give half-hearted answers, to any of my queries re the proposed dental treatment. 

Thirdly, Dr. Ojha does not hesitate to recommend all dental treatment which he may deem necessary; so that the issue is not only suitably dealt with, but also does not re-occur (even if that entails RCT and capping). 

Fourthly, Dr. Ojha is well-qualified; in as much as he is an alumnus of Manipal in Karnataka. 

Fifthly and lastly, Dr. Ojha’s clinic is extremely clean; and has been that way even prior to the outbreak of ‘COVID- 19’.
