I visited him in an extreme situation of pain and got an RCT done which he treated for quite astutely despite the challenges and problems presented.He explained the processes at every step of the way and was not keen on doing multiple procedures for patient well-being and safety. He solved for pain relief which was the pressing problem and was fair and professional in his conduct and medical advice.He has gone out of his way to ensure safety and hygiene in his clinic which makes it an added bonus during the Covid situation. In my understanding, he has only been treating patients in critical need of dental care for safety and well-being of all involved.He postponed cosmetic procedures like scaling etc as they weren't pertinent during RCT which says a lot about his earnesty of approach. I got a lot of pain relief in one sitting. Would definitely recommend.",

I visited him in an extreme situation of pain and got an RCT done which he treated for quite astutely despite the challenges and problems presented.He explained the processes at every step of the way and was not keen on doing multiple procedures for patient well-being and safety. He solved for pain relief which was the pressing problem and was fair and professional in his conduct and medical advice.He has gone out of his way to ensure safety and hygiene in his clinic which makes it an added bonus during the Covid situation. In my understanding, he has only been treating patients in critical need of dental care for safety and well-being of all involved.He postponed cosmetic procedures like scaling etc as they weren't pertinent during RCT which says a lot about his earnesty of approach. I got a lot of pain relief in one sitting. Would definitely recommend.",
