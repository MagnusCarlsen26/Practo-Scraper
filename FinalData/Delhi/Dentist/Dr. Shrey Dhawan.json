And contrary to popular belief, the root canal surgery  was almost painless. His team is brilliant and they take utmost care of you. I recommend this dental place to everyone in need of any dental procedure Dr.Shrey delivers a level of care and expertise that seldom coexists. He is a perfectionist who makes you feel more like a relative seating in his chair than simply another patient.",

They tailored their recommendations to address my specific needs and goals, providing practical advice on maintaining optimal oral hygiene and suggesting tailored treatments to enhance the health and appearance of my smile.I had multiple appointments as there were 2 RCTs, 1 extraction and throughout each appointment, the dentist and their team displayed exceptional attention to detail and a genuine commitment to my satisfaction. Every aspect of the visit, from the gentle cleaning to the meticulous examination, was executed with precision and care, ensuring a comfortable and rewarding experience.In addition to their technical expertise, Dr. Shrey and Dr. Kartik, demonstrated a genuine passion for dentistry and a dedication to staying abreast of the latest advancements in the field.Overall, my experience at Ashray Laser dental exceeded all expectations.

And contrary to popular belief, the root canal surgery  was almost painless. His team is brilliant and they take utmost care of you. I recommend this dental place to everyone in need of any dental procedure Dr.Shrey delivers a level of care and expertise that seldom coexists. He is a perfectionist who makes you feel more like a relative seating in his chair than simply another patient.",
