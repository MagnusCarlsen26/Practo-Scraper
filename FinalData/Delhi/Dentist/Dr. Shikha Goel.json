She suggested me to go for root canal on my 5 teeth which were damaged by deep cavities. I opted for treatment but got only 3 root canal done on my choice and thought of getting other two done later. I got these treated too at a dentist close to my place, as I never felt anything great about my first 3 root canal treatment.\nA year later I developed pain in that side of treatment and I was advised a CT scan by my second dentist. I got my CT done and all my root canals were evaluated. The CT guy told me \u201cHe has rarely seen such high quality root canal treatment on CBCT\u201d, he was referring to root canals done by Dr Shikha and suggested my other two root canals has failed and there was pus formation and that the procedure was done incompletely.\nNot left with a choice I went back to Dr Shikha, got root canal again on my two teeth and realized the instruments and equipment used by her were not seen at my second dentist, leave away the facility of root canal under microscope. Every five minutes in procedure a new fancy instrument was used, and she never hesitated to explain the utility of these gadgets.\nCharges too were only marginally higher than my other dentist, but I don\u2019t want to pay again for choosing someone who is not expert. All through my second visit Shikha mam never commented or said anything about my second dentist. She is a very humble, dedicated, and very advanced dental specialist and she will definitely add some \u201cwow\u201d in her signature treatment style.\n",

                "review_text": "My problem was I felt little pain on my molar tooth. Also I saw it was a bit loose.\r\nAt age of 24, Is it my milk tooth or my permanent tooth. I don't know.\r\nI asked my friend and was advised to see a doctor.\r\n\r\nI read a lot of articles and watched youtube videos before making this decision to actually visit the doctor. It filled my mind with too many questions.\r\n\r\nQuestions like:\r\n1. I came to know even after doing brush regularly one can develop gum disease.\r\n2. Gum disease is caused due to depositions on teeth actually on those places where toothbrush don't reach. Gum disease affects gums and eventually you loose that tooth forever.\r\nYou are left with a void that is a permanent.\r\n\r\nMost important question:\r\nHow can you enjoy your favourite food without teeth?\r\n\r\nI browsed for symptoms for gum disease that were like\r\n1. bleeding gums\r\n2. bad breath\r\n3. loose teeth\r\n4. puffy gums\r\n\r\nStill not sure I had little pain in my molar teeth then and now plus it is a bit loose.\r\nIt is good if you act early.\r\n\r\nSo I visited this doctor. She handled me very politely. I had many questions in my mind and I got all of them answered.\r\n\r\nShe checked my tooth and told the gums are in good condition. My molar tooth is being hold fine by my gums. My case is of sensitivity. I have lost my enamel on the molar tooth and that was a shock for me. It is maybe because of crushing my teeth one against the other.\r\n\r\nAlso one must also not brush hard because you want your teeth to shine. It is because of the deposits that harden over time. If you brush hard you will lose enamel that is given just once by the mother nature.\r\n\r\nShe told me if you can do anything now is remove the deposits that is a machine cleaning process by the doctor. One must approach for this cleaning every 6 months or one year.\r\n\r\nThis ensures\r\n1. keeps in check the deposits on teeth unreachable by tooth brush.\r\n2. deposits on check means decreasing the chances of gum diseases and subsequently fear of loosing your precious tooth.\r\n\r\nVisiting the doctor was fruitful because I came to know:\r\n1. I don't have any kind of gum disease.\r\n2. The tooth I am having right now are all permanent and I should not expect any tooth to  sprout out if I loose any of my tooth.\r\n3. My case of sensitivity and valuable information so I could prevent my teeth from further damage caused due to my ignorance in first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She is in no way comparable to general dentists scattered around in every nook and corner. \nAlthough in no way i can judge capabilities of a dentist, but the kind of problem i was facing for months was solved very comfortably by Dr Shikha, i had retained pieces of files in the roots of my two previously root canal treated teeth. My previous dentist refused to treat me further and assured all is well and I should visit some other dentist if problem persists. Luckily I discovered Dr Shikha through internet, after visiting one more dentist who could not attend my problem.\nDr Shikha not only removed the broken files from my teeth through microscope but also discovered other untreated roots in my teeth that were supposedly causing constant pain and pus in my teeth, two months later now i am totally pain free and want to show my gratitude towards her by writing this review.\n\n\n",

What i liked the most is that clinic is equipped with lot of technology and still dr shikha has managed to keep prices reasonable.\nAfter getting my treatment I got my son (3 years) treated by Dr Shikha, treatment consisted of extraction and a root canal and I was amazed to see that procedure was completed in one visit as dr shikha was equipped with laughing gas anesthesia. I have been to couple of dentists for my kid but the treatment could not be completed because he could never be relaxed enough by any dentist but technology at dr shikha's clinic helped my son to get modern treatment.\nI highly recommend this place for high end dental treatment and definitely only place for kids dental treatment",

She is very humble and soft spoken and makes one fully at ease.\nShe has all latest machines available in the clinic. Like for making a crown ,precise measurement and design is made and within an hour or two crown is ready. This avoids frequent visits\n   Clinic is very hygienic and ambience very soothing.

I went to them for a troubling painful tooth, I was advised a repeat root canal after checkup and xray. I felt the time spent by Dr Shikha on listening to my concerns is not what I expected from a busy doctor. My tooth was subjected to a digital xray and when my xray was explained to me I could easily appreciate the problem in my tooth.  The entire procedure was painless, neat and every team member was careful regarding cleanliness and hygiene during the entire procedure. After completion of root treatment in 2 visits, I received crown on this, as well got my 2 other old crowns replaced by Dr Shikha. Getting crowns was a breeze and an experience that has made Goel Dental my preferred place for any future dental work.  My crowns were delivered in 2 hours starting from impression (digital), manufacturing and fixing.",

She suggested me to go for root canal on my 5 teeth which were damaged by deep cavities. I opted for treatment but got only 3 root canal done on my choice and thought of getting other two done later. I got these treated too at a dentist close to my place, as I never felt anything great about my first 3 root canal treatment.\nA year later I developed pain in that side of treatment and I was advised a CT scan by my second dentist. I got my CT done and all my root canals were evaluated. The CT guy told me \u201cHe has rarely seen such high quality root canal treatment on CBCT\u201d, he was referring to root canals done by Dr Shikha and suggested my other two root canals has failed and there was pus formation and that the procedure was done incompletely.\nNot left with a choice I went back to Dr Shikha, got root canal again on my two teeth and realized the instruments and equipment used by her were not seen at my second dentist, leave away the facility of root canal under microscope. Every five minutes in procedure a new fancy instrument was used, and she never hesitated to explain the utility of these gadgets.\nCharges too were only marginally higher than my other dentist, but I don\u2019t want to pay again for choosing someone who is not expert. All through my second visit Shikha mam never commented or said anything about my second dentist. She is a very humble, dedicated, and very advanced dental specialist and she will definitely add some \u201cwow\u201d in her signature treatment style.\n",

                "review_text": "My problem was I felt little pain on my molar tooth. Also I saw it was a bit loose.\r\nAt age of 24, Is it my milk tooth or my permanent tooth. I don't know.\r\nI asked my friend and was advised to see a doctor.\r\n\r\nI read a lot of articles and watched youtube videos before making this decision to actually visit the doctor. It filled my mind with too many questions.\r\n\r\nQuestions like:\r\n1. I came to know even after doing brush regularly one can develop gum disease.\r\n2. Gum disease is caused due to depositions on teeth actually on those places where toothbrush don't reach. Gum disease affects gums and eventually you loose that tooth forever.\r\nYou are left with a void that is a permanent.\r\n\r\nMost important question:\r\nHow can you enjoy your favourite food without teeth?\r\n\r\nI browsed for symptoms for gum disease that were like\r\n1. bleeding gums\r\n2. bad breath\r\n3. loose teeth\r\n4. puffy gums\r\n\r\nStill not sure I had little pain in my molar teeth then and now plus it is a bit loose.\r\nIt is good if you act early.\r\n\r\nSo I visited this doctor. She handled me very politely. I had many questions in my mind and I got all of them answered.\r\n\r\nShe checked my tooth and told the gums are in good condition. My molar tooth is being hold fine by my gums. My case is of sensitivity. I have lost my enamel on the molar tooth and that was a shock for me. It is maybe because of crushing my teeth one against the other.\r\n\r\nAlso one must also not brush hard because you want your teeth to shine. It is because of the deposits that harden over time. If you brush hard you will lose enamel that is given just once by the mother nature.\r\n\r\nShe told me if you can do anything now is remove the deposits that is a machine cleaning process by the doctor. One must approach for this cleaning every 6 months or one year.\r\n\r\nThis ensures\r\n1. keeps in check the deposits on teeth unreachable by tooth brush.\r\n2. deposits on check means decreasing the chances of gum diseases and subsequently fear of loosing your precious tooth.\r\n\r\nVisiting the doctor was fruitful because I came to know:\r\n1. I don't have any kind of gum disease.\r\n2. The tooth I am having right now are all permanent and I should not expect any tooth to  sprout out if I loose any of my tooth.\r\n3. My case of sensitivity and valuable information so I could prevent my teeth from further damage caused due to my ignorance in first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She is in no way comparable to general dentists scattered around in every nook and corner. \nAlthough in no way i can judge capabilities of a dentist, but the kind of problem i was facing for months was solved very comfortably by Dr Shikha, i had retained pieces of files in the roots of my two previously root canal treated teeth. My previous dentist refused to treat me further and assured all is well and I should visit some other dentist if problem persists. Luckily I discovered Dr Shikha through internet, after visiting one more dentist who could not attend my problem.\nDr Shikha not only removed the broken files from my teeth through microscope but also discovered other untreated roots in my teeth that were supposedly causing constant pain and pus in my teeth, two months later now i am totally pain free and want to show my gratitude towards her by writing this review.\n\n\n",

What i liked the most is that clinic is equipped with lot of technology and still dr shikha has managed to keep prices reasonable.\nAfter getting my treatment I got my son (3 years) treated by Dr Shikha, treatment consisted of extraction and a root canal and I was amazed to see that procedure was completed in one visit as dr shikha was equipped with laughing gas anesthesia. I have been to couple of dentists for my kid but the treatment could not be completed because he could never be relaxed enough by any dentist but technology at dr shikha's clinic helped my son to get modern treatment.\nI highly recommend this place for high end dental treatment and definitely only place for kids dental treatment",

I went to them for a troubling painful tooth, I was advised a repeat root canal after checkup and xray. I felt the time spent by Dr Shikha on listening to my concerns is not what I expected from a busy doctor. My tooth was subjected to a digital xray and when my xray was explained to me I could easily appreciate the problem in my tooth.  The entire procedure was painless, neat and every team member was careful regarding cleanliness and hygiene during the entire procedure. After completion of root treatment in 2 visits, I received crown on this, as well got my 2 other old crowns replaced by Dr Shikha. Getting crowns was a breeze and an experience that has made Goel Dental my preferred place for any future dental work.  My crowns were delivered in 2 hours starting from impression (digital), manufacturing and fixing.",

Quite clean in her work & dealings with a straight forward approach. \r\n\r\nShe explained me the process and suggested me the options that i could go in for & helped me understand about the zirconian crown. \r\n\r\nVery professional approach (& by that I don't mean insensitive) which was impressive. The clinic was neat and I didn't have any hangups to suspend my trust.\r\n\r\nA big thank you Doctor for your good work !!",

She explained me about the onset process of wisdom tooth, checked me thoroughly and prescribed me antibiotic for minor infection treatment.

My visit to Goel Dental was a result of good reviews on Google and practo. I received first hand information about Dr shikha through her comprehensive website. During my treatment I could feel the difference between a doctor and a specialised doctor and Dr Shikha was exceptionally good in root canal treatment. My bridge was delivered after a thorough trial and only after I approved the color and shape.\nI could sense the difference how a general clinic and a specialist's clinic is equipped. There was facility for full mouth xray and modernisation in form of microscope. I opted for microscopic root canal and fillings. \n I take pleasure in recommending Goel Dental to everyone in search of good dentist.",

The best part was that the follow up was done at their Kalkaji centre which is closer to my office so I saved a lot of time in travelling to Malviya Nagar and also my leave. The team at both Kalklaji and Malviya Nagar is very knowledgable.  The Malviya Nagar centre is very well equipped.  This was my first ever dental experience and I feel very confident.

Moving beyond that, all our prices are mentioned on our website. All your findings and treatment plan were mentioned in your prescription and you could have requested your scan. We don't have provision of providing hardcopy of full mouth xray. But yes if you want it can be mailed to you. Would like to correct you again we charged you 1000 bucks (350 consultation + 650 full mouth xray). We are a private clinic and do not provide any free service. We are still baffled why you thought we provide free consultation and would not charge you anything for OPG.",

Each mm of gum that was trimmed was preplanned, contours of veneers were preplanned and followup was great too.\nThere was cost associated with everything but it was worth with kind of results I have and they remain with me forever. I have discovered a great dentist who is after perfection and is so qualified.\n",

Over the time the underlying bone and soft tissues of mouth gradually loose their density and strength causing you to experience trouble with denture but these problems are correctable with simple interventions. We don't expect patient to have all this knowledge but do expect compliance and follow up. Your opinion is accepted but definitely it cannot be generalized as all the cases are different from each other and denture cases need compliance, practice to use denture and regular followup all of which were missing from your side.",

The level of filling was thoroughly checked before you left clinic, however sometimes even after leaving the clinic some patients (like in your case) may discover a high point in area where the filling was done. This is in most probability causing you difficulty in chewing from left side. There is no need for you to worry or fear going to any other dentist, any of them can fix this. We would request you to visit us again, we will be happy to attend you and take care of your problems.",
