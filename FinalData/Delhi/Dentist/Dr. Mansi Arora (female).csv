I lost one of my insular tooth (not sure if that‚Äôs the word used for the front tooth) and nobody could fix it. But I guess my in-acceptance of even thinking that I could smile in a better way was proven wrong. And guess what? Dr. Mansi proved me wrong. 

I went to her with faded hope and first thing first, I have never seen a doctor so welcoming and investing time into understanding why I had no hopes of smiling freely again. She advised me of the tooth implant and how the implant would work but then I insisted on getting a cap in place. She didn‚Äôt deny *** **** *** *** ** ** **** **** * ******** Money absolutely is not what I was concerned about having received such admirable concern and eye to detail to correct the aesthetics which I believed even God would not fix. But she did it.  Now I smile more comfortably though am yet to drain out my subconscious style of smiling that made me think I was ugliest one in the world. And thanks to you Doctor. I can very well guarantee that there is not a single doctor who would understand the pain of the patient the way she does. Medical ailment is all about experience - and my treatment was not less than an experience that I would not forget in my life.

Dr Arora is extremely professional  yet friendly  and was  attentive to my dental issues. She was  thorough in explaining the procedures and calmly answered all my queries.

She even called and enquired about  well being of me  & my family when I was quarantined due to nCOVID 19. She would also intermittently ask if there is any extreme pain during the treatment. Her empathetic nature  was also  one of the reasons I was confident enough to get treated for all my ailing teeth at her clinic. I went through 3 RCTs with crowns and 1 tooth filling in matter of 2 months due to the same.

Also the rates for the clinical procedures and crowns are at par with the other top class dentists in the area. She will only recommend the best and won't pursue you to spend extra and unnecessary money on dental procedures.

The patient was well informed about it. 
Regarding the second part of the complaint, the patient was called N number of times for crown fixing. It is a ten mins procedure. The patient did not turn up for one and a half months. The crown could no longer fit because the space for the crown had closed. The only way to fix the same crown in her mouth was to trim the adjacent tooth, which ethically I would not do. It would lead to several problems in the healthy adjacent tooth. If the crown needs to be repeated due to patients appointment cancelations not from  the doctors end, the payment has to be made for the new crown.
