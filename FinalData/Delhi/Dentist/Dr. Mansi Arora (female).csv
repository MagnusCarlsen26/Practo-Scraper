"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Dr Mansi Arora and her team at Dental Care n Cure  clinic are beyond amazing!  The clinic is taking all necessary precautions and follow all SOPs for nCOVID 19 . The appointments are slotted in such a way that there will be no 2 patients at one given time. The enforces the COVID 19 protocols.

Dr Arora is extremely professional  yet friendly  and was  attentive to my dental issues. She was  thorough in explaining the procedures and calmly answered all my queries. She gave me best advice for my dental problems.   Due to her steady hand  and attention to details during the procedure, I always felt at ease at the dentist's chair.

She even called and enquired about  well being of me  & my family when I was quarantined due to nCOVID 19. She would also intermittently ask if there is any extreme pain during the treatment. Her empathetic nature  was also  one of the reasons I was confident enough to get treated for all my ailing teeth at her clinic. I went through 3 RCTs with crowns and 1 tooth filling in matter of 2 months due to the same.

Also the rates for the clinical procedures and crowns are at par with the other top class dentists in the area. She will only recommend the best and won't pursue you to spend extra and unnecessary money on dental procedures.

It took me a while to find a doctor that made me feel comfortable and welcomed. I wish she was my general physician as well ! Good Luck !
