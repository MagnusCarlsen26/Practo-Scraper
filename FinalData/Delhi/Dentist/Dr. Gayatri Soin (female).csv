First of all let me correct you,your first visit was in March and now in November which is 9 months and not 3. I also recommended that you restore the left side of jaw so that you can chew from both sides. you cannot be using one side of jaw ,overstressing it with all your masticatory load and then blame the Dentist. You had a very very high Gag reflex which did not let me maintain Isolation. A lot depends  on your Oral Hygiene as well. I cannot be held responsible for your POOR oral Hygiene. AS for the charges ,I am absolutely justified as there is material cost and Time involved in all the procedures. At times Yes,I may go wrong (as i am a Normal Human Being)  but in that case I have done the re-treatment absolutely free of Cost.  In your case ,I am nowhere at fault. 
Anyway Wishing you Healthy Smiles.
