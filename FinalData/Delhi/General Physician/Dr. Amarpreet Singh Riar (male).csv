First of all we are sorry that you weren‚Äôt satisfied with the staff you were in contact with.

We have verified everything that happened. 
We got in touch with the concerned receptionist and the lab as well. 
And it turned out that you have compiled a bundle of lies just because you were refused a Free consult.

1.Consult Fees is 800 RS and follow up is not charged till 5 days from anyone . Those 5 days are for getting any tests done in between or any other issue that may arise in between . You had consulted on 19 February last and now you wanted a free follow up after 17 days which is not normal. So the receptionist told you have to pay the fees which is pretty normal thing. I don‚Äôt know why you were forcing him to get you a free consultation. 

2.Secondly , you yourself called the clinic to get tests done. And you wanted tests collected from your home which is very very far away from our clinic and staff was short due to Holi. However , we still sent someone to collect your tests and you were informed of the prices before. We confirmed with the lab and you were charged usual prices and nothing extra. 

3.Now coming to the price , we have the bill with us. It‚Äôs 1600 for the multiple medicines for entire month . 50/day therapy for very high quality drugs is just normal and I don‚Äôt see anything wrong there. 800 was the fees , so total was around 2400.

4.If you want a Free Consult or you do not have the funds , you could request the receptionist for the same. Hundreds of patients are seen free or at discounted prices wherever we know that the patient genuinely cannot afford .But you cannot threaten or use abusive language. We won‚Äôt be blackmailed like that. 

5.We respect our patients as well as our staff equally. You were looking for a reconsult after 17 days from the initial consult. If you didn‚Äôt like the services in the beginning , why were you looking to consult again ? 

Our Analysis of Everything - if you were given a free consultation 17 days after your initial consult - you wouldn‚Äôt have maligned us.

It's a pity that he charged me 2200 *** **** * ***** ******* *********** (add to it 800 rupees for the medicines he prescribed, grand total of 3000).
Out of which 400 for appointment,
Plus a vaccine worth 1600 (which I checked with 2 more docs who told me that was absolutely unnecessary) and On top of that 200 rupees just to give injection.
He was also planning to give Flu vaccine worth 1000 rupees more during the next appointment for which additional follow up charge of 300 and injection charge of 200 again, but luckily my wisdom prevailed and I didn't go to him again.

Also he didn't write the medical record title as 'esonophil abnormal', rather he wrote 'visited GP for injection pneumovax' ***** ** * ***.

I clearly showed my blood report to him where everything was normal other than esonophil count.

Even the airforce doctor condemned such a prescription.
Beyond imagination * * ****** ***** *** ******** *** *****",2018-03-15 12:40:27,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hello 

You have completely misunderstood the entire protocol.
All you are concentrating is that you are student and the prices are too high for you. 

1.You said it was a mild raise in eosinophils and that‚Äôs why you visited me. The reality is you had medical fitness issues with your employer due to  your higher eosinophil count. Nobody comes to pay Rs 400 if their is no problem in the first place.
2.Secondly, The medicines given to you were perfect for the above issue and in fact , your problem might have been solved already. Those in the know how of medicine , would tell you that recurrent eosinophilia is not that small a thing either. That‚Äôs why they have medical fitness issues with the higher values. If you recovered with Rs 800 treatment , you should be very happy.
And you haven‚Äôt mentioned anything about your recovery and the good treatment you got.
All you are concerned is money because you are a student.
3.Now since the problems related to Eosinophils /allergy / RTI infections are recurrent , the patients are advised FLU VACCINE AND PNEUMOCOCCAL Vaccines to prevent the maximum problems . Since your profession is related to air travel , you should be the right people to have yearly Flu vaccines and even Pneumococcal for your prevention and also not spreading to others.
4.Our Govt is giving enough advertisements in TV and Radio for the same.
5.In fact in most of the western countries , Flu vaccines are given on yearly basis and pneumococcal given once. 
6.You were advised the same in similar words , price was told to you as well. If you had any issue , you could have refused the same rather than making an issue after you are fit.
7.Another point is of hypothetical situation where you would have to pay Consult when you visit for vaccination. Please don‚Äôt make up stories, Everyone pays only vaccination charges which is clearly stated outside Clinic to be Rs 200. No Consult is charged if someone visits only for vaccination or injection.
8.Now many companies have vaccination available , you were given the one which is most economical in India by a very renowned company MSD . It‚Äôs less than half the price of expensive versions. 
9.You must have been very happy if the entire process was free of cost, Than it would look a very noble profession. But now that you had to pay for the same , you are looking for nobility.
10.And it was clearly told the vaccines are for prevention and not for treatment . Medicines were given to you for treatment. That‚Äôs why the Flu was planned for later. 
11.And I would still suggest you to get the same and also show this piece to your Air Force doctor that everyone in the crew should get flu vaccines to prevent the flu that is spread by people traveling all over . Prevention is better than cure.
12.As a rule we try to do our best at our clinic as we are projecting it the same way . Obviously it‚Äôs the not the cheapest way.
If you are looking for free or next to free treatments , please visit GOVT hospitals and Air Force hospitals for the same . If you are visiting the best clinics in the city , we would have to do proper treatment and preventions where costs would be an issue. 
Hope you understand this.

you told my staff that you want to consult but you dont want to pay the fees because you had come 12-13 days ago and not 24 hours.

Let me describe the turn of events.

You first came to us on 31/0719 for some acidity and stomach issues, which we treated very well.

Second time you came for cough and cold on 09/08/19. Since we keep records of everything, the same is reflected in our software. You came second time because you were treated properly the first time. This time also you got relief.

However, today is 23/08/19 and you are calling us because some chemist caused some confusion with the medicines that you had 10-15 days back. The phone is meant for emergency only and rest everything you have to visit clinic if you so desire and also pay the fees. The 24 hour period is for those people who have any issues with the treatment or any allergies to drugs etc. 

If any chemist or Google is creating you any confusion try to talk with them. If you want any help, than you can visit the clinic.
But we wont be blackmailed by these reviews.
We want everyone to review us, good or bad.

my personal observation over the reviews is , that few people are happy with the good treatment but unhappy about paying the fees. 
So our request to all those patients , kindly visit any government hospital for availing free services.

Your wife came, I prescribed her medicines and she went home. All we charged her was a consult and no injections given. 
Than you called me from home, that her vomiting is not stopping and last time she had to go to hospital for the same.
We didn't want to give her injections but you insisted that her condition doesnt resolve without injections. You came , I saw her and gave her the general injections for fever , nausea,vomiting ,antibiotics and analgesics. However these multiple injections can't be given in 7 different veins, so we put intravenous route cannula and gave her the injections. The injections cost was taken. Also the patient has to pay for the service and nursing charges. Your bed charges were waived though we take the same from patients. You paid RS 1500. 
We also have you the bill for the same. And if you know what injections to give, why did u visit the doctor ?
Her Fever was 103 if u remember.
Your only problem seems to be the money and not the best quality treatment you got. Anyway you can visit Govt hospital if you are looking for free and cheap treatment.

Secondly, you brought the patient when she was hardly able to stand on her feet in a very emergency situation.
She herself was asking for injections such was her condition. Also she had been sick for a while and you had got her some cheap treatment or chemist treatment. 
You brought her only when it was required a hospitalization.
My staff did a tremendous job and she was feeling good after 2 hours of intravenous treatment.
Of course u will have to pay for Bed and treatment. We are not governmend aided hospital. 
If we don't give her those injection , how would you expect us to treat her in emergency situation. She was also given the best of appropriate drugs as u have the prescription with you. 
Everything went well, patient recovered but you are still unhappy .
And you never cared for the reports of tests either, because you didn't pay for the same.

However , the patient was referred to higher centre the same day and you took her to Safdarjung hospital as well. However , after seeing her they discharged her and you came back to me again. Again I asked you to take her to higher centre and they would give her the treatment needed at this stage of her life. I don't not what were your reasons for not getting her admitted in higher centre. Even I disvussed with you if you have any insurance panel. Why blame the doctor who has seen her for 5 minutes and reffered to higher centre the same day. You should have admitted her to hospital as per my advise. It's unreasonable to blame the doctors if you are not able to get your patient admitted with so high blood pressure. You brought your grandmother with  such complication but still  you asked my staff if KFT was really necessary that the doctor is getting done. 
However this is just to explain the turn of events. Still my condolences for your loss. You should have got her admitted to the hospital as per the advise.
