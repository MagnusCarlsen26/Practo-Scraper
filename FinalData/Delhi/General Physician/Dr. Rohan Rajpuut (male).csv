None,None,0,0,YES,"I have consulted the doctor for anxiety and other questions related to Covid. 
He is super patient, listening to the issues keenly , asks a lot of questions to understand what exactly the patient is going through and then diagnose the situation. 
I wish if every doctor could be that patient and try to give time to his patients.
I would totally recommend him to others.
