1. Whoever Visited me was not nitin you are writing this on somebody else's behalf .
2.proctoscopy is examination of anus by surgeons so improve your medical knowledge before posting review.
3.Again improve your knowledge of medical field I'm Dpcard( equivalent to MD) and then many super specialisation courses from abroad. Plus service in Indian Army and 30 years of experience. So check before you speak derogatory about anybody.
4.Weird thing I find that one person who don't like a small thing makes it a point to write a negative review but thousands of oversatisfied patient never do. I think they should also takeout time.
5. In your case the main problem appears to be that you had to pay again. Mr... Who visited me for throat infection came back after 6 days and said he requires a medical which I refused saying how can you skip office for 6 days for a simple throat infection. Consult again and if I find reason only then I'll give medical.

Maybe I used some extra time for sharing and repeating the things (I am sorry for that) but he listened to them every time and prescribed the medicines accordingly.

Next, we were explained in detail about the diet regime and importance of physical activity (trust me all the things suggested by them are highly easy to do and it will not impact your lifestyle or food habits). - I can eat everything barring sugar only.

Because from the last two visits on repeated requests your mother was not taking medicine properly used to take only half medicine and her sugar was not under control. You can't be choosy about the medicines you have to take all that is prescribed. So this time you were specifically told to take medicine for one month from here so that I can see that with proper medication her sugar goes down or not. I told you clearly that my patient's well being is first priority so please take medicine from here so that I know you are eating medicines. Otherwise look for some other Dr who just write medicine and finishes the job.",2020-07-14T14:03:10+0000,Dr. Amitabh Khanna
