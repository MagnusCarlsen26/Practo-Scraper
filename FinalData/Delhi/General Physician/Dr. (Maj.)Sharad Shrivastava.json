It was always good to be treated with professionalism and care. He goes out of his way to make sure all your questions are answered. He works with you to address your health concerns, rather than just telling you what to do. He always wants to make sure that you and him are on the same page and comfort level and goes out of his way to care of his patients. Coming here is like dealing with trusted family. \nMy family comprises of age group from 14 yrs to 86 yrs and is fit & healthy because of timely advise and medication prescribed by Dr. Shrivastava. My father who is 86 yrs old, always feels so relieved whenever he interacts with Dr Srivastava. Last Sunday my father was feeling anxiety and wanted to visit the clinic. When I called Dr. Shrivastava he immediately responded despite having tight schedule in current scenario. I was so touched. \nI am always thankful to Dr Shrivastava for being my Family doctor.\n",

It was always good to be treated with professionalism and care. He goes out of his way to make sure all your questions are answered. He works with you to address your health concerns, rather than just telling you what to do. He always wants to make sure that you and him are on the same page and comfort level and goes out of his way to care of his patients. Coming here is like dealing with trusted family. \nMy family comprises of age group from 14 yrs to 86 yrs and is fit & healthy because of timely advise and medication prescribed by Dr. Shrivastava. My father who is 86 yrs old, always feels so relieved whenever he interacts with Dr Srivastava. Last Sunday my father was feeling anxiety and wanted to visit the clinic. When I called Dr. Shrivastava he immediately responded despite having tight schedule in current scenario. I was so touched. \nI am always thankful to Dr Shrivastava for being my Family doctor.\n",

Please understand that as health care workers we try and ensure every patient gets proper attention and care. However there tends to be instances like the one you described once in a while.\nWe try to better ourselves every time. The Patient attendant Mr. Balachandran doesn't have patience and his behavior was found inhuman to a man as well as to a Doctor. As a Physician one may be busy busy and occupied. It happened many times that Doctor do not live a normal routine family life and his family remains neglected. Mr. Balachandran wanted immediate attention by giving 2 calls to my reception on the very next day of his visit wanted neglection of  other Patients , who were already in the que for the treatment. He did not even tried to contact even on the very next day of his calls if he was really interested in seeking medical advice or had any emergency . Neither he sent anyone to my office for immediate attention nor tried to contact my office or me ,  if there was any life threatening condition. I think that his behavior was very irrelevant and has taken Doctors and Medical professional granted for order and serve basis.",

He heard our problem and saw the various papers and documents of Govt. Hospitals. He examined my Father thoroughly and did one ECG. After that he wrote a prescription. My Father took  medicines prescribed by him . He started feeling better and started  going back on the  Job. We once again revived and came out of Shock we suffered. The medicines prescribed by him were not much costly. we could afford such cheaper and beneficial medicines.

                "review_text": "I was suffering from high grade fever for last 4 days n for that i met to a local doctor near to my house . My Fever was not coming down with his medicine. I was really scared and tensed. I saw list of Doctors on Practo. i  booked an appointment with Dr. Shrivastava. When i reached there , i found a good establishment. Since i had an appointment it took very less time to meet Dr. Sharad. I was very comfortable with him because he gave me ample time to speak. Then he asked me some questions and examined me fully.He wrote a prescription having only 3 drugs. I was really satisfied with the approach taken by the Doctor. It took hardly one day to recover and now i am feeling much better and went back on my regular routine and job. Dr. Shrivastava is really polite, a good listener and have great patience to hear the Patient. I am really happy and recommend others to meet him in case of genuine medical consultation.",
