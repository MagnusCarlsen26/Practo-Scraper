Only 30 of my 20,000  patients from 35 countries have been able to reverse diabetes with their hardwork and dedication.
In the same away over 1300 patients got rid of insulin once they have learnt how to defeat insulin resistance. Everyone have invested their time to achieve something that they wanted from the beginning. To win the battle against diabetes. Good luck ",2019-11-11T14:18:58+0000,Dr. Anirban Biswas
