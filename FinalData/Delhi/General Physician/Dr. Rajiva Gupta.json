He consistently demonstrated exceptional skill and compassion in providing care his thoroughness in diagnosing my condition and explaining treatment options was truly commendable. I was having severe stomach ache but he diagnosed it in few minutes and I got well soon.\n\nAfter that I again visited him for my mothers' health problem. His empathetic approach to the whole condition made her feel better after the visit and motivated her to follow the daily routine prescribed by the doctor. It was his remarkable ability to connect on a human level, making her feel seen and understood. He diagnosed her condition perfectly and she was happy after the visit.\n\nThanks you Dr. Rajiva for your unwavering commitment to your patients' well-being.\n\n",

My health had been a rollercoaster for months, with symptoms that seemed to confound everyone I'd consulted. As I stepped into the warm, inviting reception area, a sense of calm began to wash over me, a precursor to the exceptional experience that awaited.\n\nDr. Gupta greeted me with a smile that felt both professional and genuinely kind, an amalgamation of qualities not often found in tandem. From the outset, it was clear that he was a listener, a trait I would soon learn was the bedrock of his practice. He didn't rush through the consultation. Instead, he took his time, ensuring that every word I said was heard and every concern I had was addressed.\n\nThe consultation room was a reflection of Dr. Gupta\u2019s approach to medicine: organized, serene, and equipped with the latest technology, yet it felt as comfortable as a living room. As we discussed my health, I was struck by his methodical yet empathetic approach. He wove together my medical history, symptoms, and concerns with the skill of a master storyteller, making complex medical information understandable and less intimidating.\n\nDr. Gupta\u2019s diagnosis and tests that he recommended were thorough, backed by a clear explanation and a detailed plan for my path forward. He answered all my questions with patience and an evident depth of knowledge, making me feel involved in my treatment plan. His approach was not just about addressing the symptoms but understanding the person behind them, a holistic approach that was both refreshing and reassuring.\n\nAs the visit came to a close, Dr. Gupta shared a few words of encouragement that felt tailor-made for my situation. It wasn't just his medical expertise that left an impact; it was his remarkable ability to connect on a human level, making me feel seen and understood.\n\nLeaving the clinic that day, I felt a renewed sense of hope. My journey to recovery was just beginning, but I knew I had found a doctor in Dr. Gupta  who was not just a physician but a trusted ally.\n\nThis experience wasn't just about a medical consultation; it was a testament to the power of compassionate care. I only believe in holistic treatments with an allopathic diagnosis. Living in the US over the last 18 years have made me very aware of how chronic conditions are mostly treated with  medications which could leave a patient dependent on those for life.\n\nDr. Gupta exemplified what it means to be a remarkable internal medicine doctor - a beacon of knowledge, empathy, and support. In a world where the human aspect of healthcare often feels overshadowed by the clinical, my visit to Dr. Gupta was a poignant reminder of its importance, a story of a doctor and a patient, and the profound impact of truly being heard.",

He consistently demonstrated exceptional skill and compassion in providing care his thoroughness in diagnosing my condition and explaining treatment options was truly commendable. I was having severe stomach ache but he diagnosed it in few minutes and I got well soon.\n\nAfter that I again visited him for my mothers' health problem. His empathetic approach to the whole condition made her feel better after the visit and motivated her to follow the daily routine prescribed by the doctor. It was his remarkable ability to connect on a human level, making her feel seen and understood. He diagnosed her condition perfectly and she was happy after the visit.\n\nThanks you Dr. Rajiva for your unwavering commitment to your patients' well-being.\n\n",

My health had been a rollercoaster for months, with symptoms that seemed to confound everyone I'd consulted. As I stepped into the warm, inviting reception area, a sense of calm began to wash over me, a precursor to the exceptional experience that awaited.\n\nDr. Gupta greeted me with a smile that felt both professional and genuinely kind, an amalgamation of qualities not often found in tandem. From the outset, it was clear that he was a listener, a trait I would soon learn was the bedrock of his practice. He didn't rush through the consultation. Instead, he took his time, ensuring that every word I said was heard and every concern I had was addressed.\n\nThe consultation room was a reflection of Dr. Gupta\u2019s approach to medicine: organized, serene, and equipped with the latest technology, yet it felt as comfortable as a living room. As we discussed my health, I was struck by his methodical yet empathetic approach. He wove together my medical history, symptoms, and concerns with the skill of a master storyteller, making complex medical information understandable and less intimidating.\n\nDr. Gupta\u2019s diagnosis and tests that he recommended were thorough, backed by a clear explanation and a detailed plan for my path forward. He answered all my questions with patience and an evident depth of knowledge, making me feel involved in my treatment plan. His approach was not just about addressing the symptoms but understanding the person behind them, a holistic approach that was both refreshing and reassuring.\n\nAs the visit came to a close, Dr. Gupta shared a few words of encouragement that felt tailor-made for my situation. It wasn't just his medical expertise that left an impact; it was his remarkable ability to connect on a human level, making me feel seen and understood.\n\nLeaving the clinic that day, I felt a renewed sense of hope. My journey to recovery was just beginning, but I knew I had found a doctor in Dr. Gupta  who was not just a physician but a trusted ally.\n\nThis experience wasn't just about a medical consultation; it was a testament to the power of compassionate care. I only believe in holistic treatments with an allopathic diagnosis. Living in the US over the last 18 years have made me very aware of how chronic conditions are mostly treated with  medications which could leave a patient dependent on those for life.\n\nDr. Gupta exemplified what it means to be a remarkable internal medicine doctor - a beacon of knowledge, empathy, and support. In a world where the human aspect of healthcare often feels overshadowed by the clinical, my visit to Dr. Gupta was a poignant reminder of its importance, a story of a doctor and a patient, and the profound impact of truly being heard.",

His high calibre, exceptional ******* ********** deep commitment to patient care and a humane approach is his calling card! We visited Dr Rajiva late evening with an acute medical condition which other doctors were unable to diagnose. He heard us so patiently, inquired deeply about our medical history and wrote down everything on the prescription pad. His attention to detail was exceptional. He advised immediate treatment and tests, and parallely got us an urgent radiology appointment in the night with immediate reporting. These proved to be the catalyst for the subsequent treatment. He followed up on the progress for the next 2 days, and advised hospitalisation on a saturday evening, when doctors are not easily available. Upon admission he went out of the way and called up the senior most doctor at the hospital (even when he was off-duty) and got the treatment started rightaway (on a weekend!!). Throughout the admission, he inquired on the progress on a daily basis, and spoke to required doctors to ensure we get the best possible treatment. Its due to his exceptional commitment and timely intervention at every stage, that the problem got identified, and we were able to get the required treatment at the hospital. I consider my family to be blessed to have Dr Rajiva by our side for any medical consultation & advise! ",

His proactive approach and attention to detail were truly commendable, especially in a time-sensitive situation.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Gupta's efforts didn't stop there. Recognizing the severity of the situation, he facilitated my father's transfer to a reputable hospital where he could receive specialized care. His quick thinking and ability to coordinate effectively with other medical professionals undoubtedly contributed to my father's recovery.\n\nI cannot express enough gratitude for Dr. Rajiva Gupta's exceptional care and support during this challenging time. His professionalism, empathy, and dedication to his patients are truly remarkable. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Gupta to anyone in need of medical care, knowing they will be in the best possible hands.\n\nThank you, Dr. Gupta, for your unwavering commitment to your patients' well-being. You have made a lasting impact on our family, and we are forever grateful.",

He is thorough, patient and extremely fair, without unnecessary medical jargon. He takes the time to explain the issue well, follows up on his patients' wellbeing, and his treatments have always worked for me - all things that have translated into me consulting only him as my primary doctor, even if that means flying from Bombay to Delhi. Highly recommended!",

I have visited medical professionals in several countries around the world, especially the U.S. and after my recent experience I would trust him entirely with my health.\n\nI took the husband of my house help, for diagnosis, to Dr. Gupta.  The patient had been suffering from odd, severe and unpredictable body aches for over a year. He wasn't able to work and it had impacted the mental health of him and his family.  After seeing various doctors in this area,  he had resigned himself to a \"no-cure\" situation.  Another doctor had told him to just get used to it.  I brought him to Dr. Gupta.  I was fortunate, for the sake of this patient, that I found Dr, Gupta.  His direct style and reassuring manner, allowed him to get key clues on what could possibly be happening.  A series of tests later, he had correctly diagnosed that it was a case of rheumatoid arthritis, with potential to be treated before and help restore health.  (A specialist later confirmed this).  WHile this seems simple on the surface, the key was identifying the types of tests needed without going overboard.  Many of these clues had been missed by prior doctors.  Thirty days of medication later, the patient is back at work!!  Need I say more?\n\nPersonally I like Dr. Gupta's direct style.  His focus on helping the patient first is very refreshing.  And the end of the day, a Doctor's capabilities trump everything.  I would trust him with my health and I share this in the hope that this helps others looking to overcome health challenges.",

It was difficult to see a doctor personally during that time given that she was tested positive for Covid and we do not live in a Metro city where quality healthcare is available. We started searching for a good Internal Medicine Dr online and came to know about Dr Rajiva Gupta. We scheduled an online appointment and started consulting with him over video calls. In November 2020 my mother became very sick. We called Dr Rajiva and he picked up our call despite being out of India. He saw my mom over video and advised us to admit her immediately to a hospital. We were able to take my mom to a hospital and treat her on time before her condition could get worse. We truly thank Dr Rajiva for responding to us on time and help us save my Mom\u2019s life that night.\n\nMy Mom again became sick in July 2022. She had fever with chills. We thought she may have viral fever. Next day her blood pressure started dropping and I texted Dr Rajiva. He not only responded to my text but also spoke with me over phone even though he was traveling. He advised us to admit my Mom to a hospital. My Mom got treatment on time before her condition could get worse. Once again Dr. Rajiva helped us in a crucial time.\n\nDr Rajiva is very kind. He listens to you no matter how many questions you ask. The best part of him is being reachable when you need his advice to make right decision. I am totally dependent on him for my Mom\u2019s healthcare. We are thankful to have him as our family doctor.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Rajiva! \n\nThank you very much Dr Rajiva for all your help and advise!",

Thanks Doctor Rajeev for being with us and supporting us in our difficult stage of life , we can never forget what you have done for my mother , thanks for saving her life .

To be true, I was amazed how beautifully he first tried to understand my situation, learned about my lifestyle, day 2 day habits, work stress and accordingly suggested me the next steps. He took time to guide me through, which helped me ease a lot and prepare myself for travel without stressing on the sugar levels. His apt medication prescription and lifestyle guidance helped me control my sugar level within stipulated time. I can\u2019t thank him enough for the help he extended to go over and beyond to check on the medication guidelines and other customs restrictions and formalities required to carry medication overseas. The best part about Sir is he takes an extra effort to take follow ups and is very approachable. He always stay connected and gives a sense of safety and security that you are in best hands and under best persons care. I would highly recommend Dr Rajiva ",

Dr. Gupta truly exemplifies the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated doctor.\nWe consulted him for my mother for her high blood pressure, and I was seeking a consultation for my overall health and wellness. One of the standout qualities is his commitment to providing the best care possible while avoiding unnecessary medications and tests. He takes a holistic approach to medicine, focusing on patient well-being above all else.\nDuring the consultation, he demonstrated an impressive level of patience and attentiveness. He listened carefully to the concerns, asked pertinent questions, and took the time to explain his recommendations and treatment options thoroughly. This makes one feel valued and well-informed about health.\nIn a world where rushed appointments and overprescribing are unfortunately common, Dr. Gupta is a breath of fresh air. His dedication to providing personalized care and his commitment to ethical medical practices are truly commendable.\nI would highly recommend Dr Gupta to anyone seeking a knowledgeable, patient-focused, and caring healthcare professional. My family and I are grateful for the outstanding care he has provided, and we trust him wholeheartedly with our health and well-being.",

Rajiva Gupta is an amazing doctor. When I previously had a severe throat infection, thinking of getting Covid made me really nervous. I felt lot more at ease, though, after talking with him and getting his assurance that I don't need to be afraid. He then prescribed medication.  When my condition deteriorated, he always responded favorably by mid-night, and not only that, but he even sent me a message the following day asking how I was doing. He did a great job when I recently visited his clinic, Upchaar Wellness. He explained everything to me in great detail. Not only has he taken excellent care of my health, but he also always greets me with kindness and friendliness. It's rare to find a doctor who provides excellent medical care along with such individualized attention and concern for the patient as a whole. He actually understands your issues and pays attention to them. In order to solve their medical concerns, he spends time with the patient! I highly recommend becoming his patient. I'm so appreciative of him.",

What I found was that he was cordial and patiently listened to me on all occasions.. I have been struggling with type2 diabetes for quite some time now and I have visited many doctors.. I love that Dr Rajiva is very friendly and understands our lifestyle. Instead of prescribing endless tests and medication he advocates on lifestyle change to control my blood sugar level. I liked that he would never asked me to monitor my sugar tests everyday pre and post food intake  instead he asked me monitor it once a day as he felt that was sufficient for my sugar levels and everytime I sent my stats he would always make it a point to respond in positive words that always encouraged me. I feel it\u2019s important that doctors understand their patients work routine and stress levels before providing a treatment cauze this plays a vital role in controlling our sugar levels and that\u2019s exactly what Dr Rajiva does. I am always energised and feel motivated every time I go for my check ups. I trust him so much so that I have also started taking my parents to him for health checks as I trust his treatment now!",

Every time I go to my EX -Doctor, they use to see blood report and prescribe the X-Y-Z medicine , as usual doctors don't have much time, they don't speak to you for any other factors. This story continued for years, I was bored and depressed with this procedure.\nWhen I came to know about Dr Rajiva Gupta , I thought let's meet him.\nAnd the miracle happened, I was surprised he didn't talk about sugar levels, medicines etc.He calmly understood my lifestyle, my routine ,my stress level, habits etc. Then suggested some small modifications and very easy to incorporate in my life my routines,within my approach.\nPart of the routine was, checking your sugar levels fasting sugar daily and sending it to your Dr. With your diet modifications seeing the results everyday, and at the same time sending the results to Dr. And he says very good , good , \ud83d\udc4d or giving thumps up, makes you happy \ud83d\ude0a and half of the stress \u2764\ufe0f gone. And most comfortable is your Dr is just one call or one message away from you , he is so approachable is the most important thing.\nMy sugar levels are in control within one month and stress is not there about my condition I know my Dr is with me in this journey \ud83d\ude4f and my efforts are to be consistent . I highly recommend him if you are looking for a miracle.. \ud83d\ude4f\n",

One of my colleagues suggested to visit Dr Rajiva Gupta whom he was pretty impressed with. Riding on that confidence I booked a slot through Practo. The place where he sits is very calm. While I was sitting their waiting for my chance, I was already getting positive vibes the way he was talking to patients, amount of time he was giving to them and the connectivity that he built in such a short time. When I was being examined, the same happened, same connectivity, he wrote some tests and was also considerate about my expenses on tests, which was again a unique thing I have seen. He asked me to share the reports over WhatsApp and keep following up there only. When the reports came out, it was covid positive. He guided me over calls, messages and apart from me also was asking about my wife condition and gave medication and advices to her as well. This continued for next two weeks with change of medicine and other courses. At the end of 3rd week my cough was gone and I\u2019m fully recovered. \nI recommend Dr Rajiva Gupta for primarily three things:\n1. He listens to patients, connect with them and keep following up later on as well. \n2. He is considerate about patient\u2019s expenses. \n3. He goes beyond the boundary to not just care about the patient but also about their family. ",

He even prescribed medication for all this in addition to diabetes medicine. I became very disturbed by his analysis of my reports and wasn\u2019t able to digest his opinion. \nAt this time I consulted my son who is a pharmacy graduate and MBA in pharma management and currently working as Teritory Manager with a multinational company and stays at Gurugram. He fixed an appointment with Dr. Rajeev Gupta after going through positive feedback of lot of patients. I must say after taking to him my anxiety was over and I could sleep properly after a week. He prescribed minimum medication and after continuing for one month, my fasting, PP and random sugar levels are with in range. BP is also normal without any medicine. \nI strongly recommend him for consulting for your ailments. ",

We first consulted him in 2021 during covid second wave where not only did he support us through difficult times by keeping us motivated, but also through great experience and sharp findings which helped cure some really complex post covid health problems, some of which would have required hospitalisation. But we were able to follow home treatment that too with Rajiva Sir constantly connected over the phone on the progress.\n\nFast forward to last week in Jan 2023, things started with headache to high bp and very low body temperature due to which there was a panic and a sense of urgency. We contacted doctor outside of his visiting hours, but due to the urgency, he promptly allowed us to visit his residence and get diagnosis. Thanks to his expertise, his medicines reduced the symptoms quickly where we would have visited hospital  otherwise.\n\nNot to mention, he is also a great human being who would guide to follow good practices and healthy lifestyle which can already reduce half of these symptoms. \n\nThank you sir for your support and guidance.",

As per hospital discharged summary, he was on 16 units Insulin which made me very tensed. \n\nI booked an appointment with Dr. Rajiva and the kind of touch which I felt from the very first discussion can't be described in words. Within few days my father insulin came to 11 units and now after 2 weeks his sugar is in control and Dr. suggested to stop some medicines as well.\n\nAlso, on few occasions, I sent late night SMS to him and the good thing is that he called me immediately to clear my every doubt. I asked him a lot of questions but he did n't get irritated and answered them to my complete satisfaction. Even, the kind of relationship which he makes with his clients are truly awesome. \n\nWe are very thankful to Dr Rajiva Gupta. You are like a GOD to us.",

My father has been having diabetes for the last 3 years, due to which his health has been deteriorating.I appreciate his thorough explanations during our appointments. Sir listened to my Father patiently and tried to understand the actual reason behind the constant increase in sugar level and history (not all doctors would give their precious time to hear). He is very approachable, as i had been sharing the progress and sugar level daily and Sir was responding to all my queries.Dr Rajiva Gupta's expertise and personalized approach have made a significant difference in my Father's well-being. The treatment plan has been very effective.Thank you for your commitment to patient care.",

Her BP and sugar levels have come down a lot, and I am very thankful to Dr. Rajiva Gupta. I would highly recommend him.",

On learning a  very high level  of blood glucose,  he immediately  called me to his clinic, administered insulin, and started the treatment and asked me to share glucose reading every day.Now, for more than 2 weeks,I have been in constant touch with the doctor, updating him on my sugar level daily.  He has been very prompt in his response to each and every reading, advising changes in medication as & when needed.  What is really remarkable is that he would not shy away from calling you if deviations  are substantial, be it a weekend or even if he is out of station.Overall,  I can see he is personally investing his time for the well-being of his patient. Something which perhaps only your family doctors may do.Highly recommend and thank you, doctor, for all your guidance and perseverance on my case.",

He took the time to understand our personal situation and provided us with practical advice that was tailored to our specific needs.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Dr. Sarah Smith to anyone in need of medical care. He is a skilled Doctor who truly cares about his patients.",

What matters most is the support, during ongoing treatment, which a patient looks at from his Doctor and am glad to share that Doctor Rajiva Gupta was instant support over WhatsApp - call at all times.

He recommended hospitalisation and guided her through the next steps. By the time we reached the hospital, he had spoken with the Emergency staff and they were ready for me. While in the ICU, I was diagnosed with Dengue. Over the next 5 days Dr Gupta was in constant touch with my family and the CK Birla team of doctors. He even came to see me multiple times. Having met him only once in the OPD, we couldn't have expected this level of engagement, commitment and caring. Dr Gupta's involvement was very reassuring for my wife and family through this ordeal. Without him I couldn't have got through this. ",

He offers medical and other advice from his long and illustrious years of experience. \n\nI found him to be a doctor who keenly  observed our world. And the people who inhabit it. His wisdom extends much beyond medical science, and he is happy to share it.\n\nIn India, we use the term family doctor often. Dr. Gupta is a doctor who makes you feel like he is part of your family. I know this is not what a family doctor means, but what the heck, I like to define the terms I use \ud83d\ude42",

A daily update on falling platelets brought us together over a strategy to take extreme measures to boost platelets. Luckily for me the platelets reversed upwards and didn't need to be hospitalized. Dr.Gupta continued to provide all support and advice in the most reassuring manner.. will surely recommend him for his patience and ability to not recommend strong medicines unnecessarily. He even shared medical world benchmarks to reassure of his treatment process. Thank you Dr.Gupta!",

I can fondly remember visiting Dr Rajiva Gupta's clinic for anything and everything related to health issues, ever since I was a young boy. Even though, now he has shifted to Gurugram, but he is still our anchor point, and first point of contact for health concerns. Just entering his chamber, takes away more than half of worries, since he has excellent line of diagnosis, and prescriptions. ANTIBIOTICS are his last resorts, not prescribing them like newbies now a days do. I even visit him at DLF clinic, commuting almost 60kms, and this is evidence enough of the faith one can have in your doctor, even though we have around 25-30 consultants in our locality. Always indebted to the care he has given, and kindness he doesn't even need to show.",

Recent concerns like fever, body ache, anxiety, BP etc in family have been very well managed under his supreme guidance, and counselling. His diagnosis is very apt...At any situation we don't see any other doctor except him...Even if he is in USA we would prefer to consult him online rather than going to any other doctor.

At the time when I met the doctor, my sugar fasting routine was between 250 mg/dl to 350 mg/dl  and PP used to go from 350 mg/dl to 500md/dl or more.  But today if I say that my sugar fasting has come between 98 to 130 in just 15 days then it will not be wrong to say that. Earlier I was also taking very high doses of two diffrent insulins, which I had to take three times a day.  But the Doctor Shri Rajeev Gupta ji not only treated me by reducing my insulin dose and prescribed insulin in a small amount at one time and a good result also came out. He also did my counseling, which helped a lot in removing stress.  Thankyou Dr.  Rajeev Gupta.\n\nRegards: \nMohan Sharma, Adv.",

The detailed explanation of the issues concerning my father's health and prompt actions on prescribing the appropriate medicines reflected his superiority in his field. But I'd also like to mention what a gem of a person he is, who not only provided medical guidance but also emotional support, reassuring us of better future during these hard times. My dad had some complications related to Diabetes during the Covid treatment too and that was also handled very well by doctor as he took out the time for daily updates on his vitals. My father's doing well and has recovered now. I 100% recommend Dr. Rajiva Gupta to anyone seeking expert medical help. Thank you, Dr. Gupta.",

He spends as much time as needed with you to get all questions answered and makes sure you don't leave with doubts. Even after completing my fight with this I received a call back from him 7 days after just to check how I am feeling now for if any post covid symptoms. Now where do you get such kind of attention as a patient, and this extra mile made me submit by review for him. Many many stars for his extraordinary service to mankind. Thank you.",

I first consulted him for my Vertigo problem, then for my mother-in-law, followed by when my husband got viral fever and now again for my mother -in-law. He patiently hears out to the problems and provides very satisfied consultancy. He is anytime and all the time available even for small queries relating to medicine, dosage, symptoms, etc. and one has to just drop a message/whatsapp to him and he surely replies within minutes. As he is also available for video consultation, it has helped us a lot in our time of need. The rich experience that he carries with him, is reflected in his diagnosis and medicines. We need more doctors like you Sir!",

This is exactly how he has been treating my mother by taking slow and careful steps. He's also been counselling me and my mother, which is again a rarity.\n\nI found Dr Rajeeva Gupta on Google. Upon contacting him he immediately gave his attention to my mother's diabetic complication. One very good thing about him is that he's easily accessible whenever I need to consult him.  \n\nI'd highly recommend Dr Gupta to all the needy patients out there. \nI would like to thank for being so generous. \ud83d\ude4f",

He is very soft-spoken and excellent at his job. He diagnosed me with Osteoporosis which wasn't identified by other doctors whom I consulted earlier and is treating me for this, besides prediabetes and lifestyle management. Highly recommend Dr Rajiva Gupta as a family physician and internal medicine doctor. Thank you.",

He immediately boosted up my morale and prescribed just one antibiotic in tablet form. After taking that for a week, I got my urine culture done again and learnt that the infection was gone.

His vast experience, expertise, healing power and assurances gave me the much needed strength to pull my parents out of this situation in home care. He would always take calls and be so prompt in reverting to my messages. So often he would give his time to simply assure me while I would panic. Talking to him each time, made me feel so secure and full of hope. My parents recovered well and I am and will always be very grateful to him. Highly recommend his medical attention !",

Doctor not only was quick about his diagnosis for the problem but his mode of treatment was effective. He explained me every thing I wanted to know. He was very patient to listen all my questions and  has a  friendly approach. When my mother's health deteriorated he asked me to quickly hospitalised her which helped us to take necessary action. I am really thankful to you sir for helping my mother fight this covid battle.Best wishes Covid warrior :)  ",

He has an enriching experience of many years and that's reflected in his advice for my mother's recurring infections and kidney failure problems.\n\nGood doctors make a lot of difference in patient's life.

He takes his time getting to know the problem and cross questions the patient to make sure no detail is missed, before reaching a diagnosis.And he answers each and every question in detail without being in a hurry, and will also go into the technical details if you're interested. He lets us know  what long term action plan he is thinking of, in addition to a short term treatment course.Another think I liked is that he is always available and very responsive, and makes sure to follow up with his patients.Would recommend Dr. Rajiva if you have any symptoms for which the root cause is not known. I think a correct diagnosis is the most important thing for treating any problem.",

Dr. Gupta gives us sufficient time and listen/understand the problem carefully and also explained us how the treatment will progress.  Not only that, he also extended his support and guided us how to get treatment of  Gastro and Neurological issues of our Mother as well.  We have no words to thank him for his timely guidance which cured our bed ridden mother as this was a great challenge to cure such patients.

I was in home quarantine under his supervision and the overall journey went well. I felt secured under his treatment which is indeed what a patient looks for. No exaggeration: Dr.Rajiv is quite a genuine human and a brilliant physician who really cares for the his patients and it won\u2019t be wrong if I say that his patients are his 1st priority. I am really happy to have consulted him for my Covid-19 treatment.",

I must say it was my best decision because the way he dealt with my case I was able to control & bring the sugars to the most suitable level for my pregnancy. Even with very little options to treat during pregnancy, with his counselling and treatment skills he managed to make me non-diabetic (HBA1C less than 6). Event after my delivery i still consult him for diabetes management.

In the first sight he told that your anxiety level is high, and that was exactly the case after BP test. He also asked to go through some tests but he clearly said that everything will be normal as per my experience and the case was same. I had only vit D deficiency which is very common these days. He prescribed medicines and told that to just focus on your studies and don't think about the results and also do some exercise and yoga. He treated me like his son and I was so heartedly connected to him that i could not resist myself from touching his feet. I strongly recommend him.",

I have always had a great experience consulting him.  He is detail oriented, supporting and most importantly a great listener in terms of doctor. He always gives the solution to the problem based on facts.  His treatment is satisfactory and will recover you in less days. Also he would only prescribe you medicines when it's necessary and will not keep you on extra dosages. He not only personally takes follow ups of the patients but also available during odd hours through phone calls or whatsApp. He is punctual and stays late for the patients and never in hurry.... Patient's satisfaction is his ultimate happiness & priority. I would say he was made to be the star \u2b50 that our Dr Rajiva is.... The way he gives his personal touch to treat his patient is his uniqueness. He would make you feel like his own family member that's how he is.... I would strongly recommend everyone who is seeking kind, compassionate and brilliant doctor... Once you consult him i bet you would never switch your doctor anytime soon..... ",

None of them were able to diagnose the disease & seems they were testing on medicines on her. She was taking TB Medicines even when no medical reports said, she has abdominal TB.\nAs a result, she became so weak as if there were huge side effects of those medicines. She was not able to walk\n\nI brought my mom to GGN & consulted Dr. Rajiva. He listened to all issues very patiently, checked all back reports & suggested for full body medical tests along with ultrasound. The best thing I saw, he doesn't prescribe so many medicines & hit on the root cause of disease. He explains the root cause in most simplest way, I experienced\n\nHe prescribed medicines to her for approx. 3 months & now She is perfectly fine & doing well. A lot improved in last 3 months for me, mentally as well  as I think, my mom got a new life after being ill for so many days. I can now focus on my work as my mom is now absolutely fine.\n\nI suggest to whomsoever is reading my story on Practo to go & meet Dr. Rajiva, if you are so much tensed due to health issues of yours / your loving ones.\n",

However I would like to submit ha he was heard in detail , given enough time and with full patience  despite a technical issue with the video calling. Contrary to in person physical consultation where the doctor notes down the clinical details of the patient concurrently with history taking and examination , in tele consultation the diagnosis and treatment is based on visual impression ,talking to the patient , clinical details , laboratory investigations reports and treatment undertaken earlier It is likely that the doctor offering tele consultation may miss pertinent points of verbal description while analyzing the details and writing the prescription. Therefore it is helpful for the doctor and in the interest of the patient for the details to be mentioned on the chat.  There may be back to back consultation on the Practo in successive slots because of which immediate delivery of the prescription may not be feasible. The patients are always given the liberty to call me for any clarification or concern. The same protocol was followed here as for other satisfied patients . A digital prescription was sent to him on practo promptly within the stipulated time along with a suggestion to revert for any clarification.",

Since, he was out of town, I took an appointment online to have a consultation with him. A previous consultation with a different doctor had me convinced that a surgery was needed and that the blister wouldn\u2019t go away on its own. However, Dr. Gupta advised that it was a cyst that had formed and we could wait and watch how it behaved and accordingly decide what was to be done. I appreciate how patiently he listens and advises in the most practical manner. I\u2019d definitely recommend him to any patient who wants himself/ herself to be heard.",

He prescribed medicines and told that to just focus on your studies and don't think about the results and also do some exercise and yoga. He treated me like his son and I was so heartedly connected to him that i could not resist myself from touching his feet. I strongly recommend him.",

In the first place I decided to contact him going by positive reviews on Practo shared by others who had consulted him. I am so glad I did, as my experience has been very good! He is a good listener, high on empathy and encourages questions to which he replies clearly and patiently. \nThe medicines he prescribed along with a good diet plan has helped bring down my sugar levels in a matter of 10 days. He also shared additional links on connection of stress and diabetes which really impressed me. He is open minded and has a holistic approach to treatment.\nI am in touch with him post consultation and he keeps responding very swiftly to my queries and offers advise whenever I approach him. We definitely need more Doctors like him. \nThank you so much Doctor.  \ud83d\ude4f",

I consulted him after being grossly dissatisfied with two renowned doctors for reasons totally other than competence, one of these doctors were extremely difficult to reach for any post-consultation question, the phone was also picked up by his receptionist/secretary and despite sending him an email and messages on whats up there was no response and the second doctor seemed to be in great hurry while consulting and made certain comments which I did not find very mature and feel that could have been avoided. I am not only happy but absolutely delighted that I found Dr. Rajiva Gupta.  I would whole heartedly recommend him.  Chances are you too will feel equally blessed.

The first two docs I consulted though prescribed right medicines for her, but what was missing from them is constant monitoring and personal care that differentiated Rajiva Sir from others. \n\nMyself and all my family members were surprised to know a doc inquiring about my mother's health and sugar level on a regular basis throughout the treatment.  God's grace her sugar level has come down to 190-200 (random) within 2-3 weeks. \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr Rajiva not only because of his expertise in medicine but his genuine concern towards his patient which I feel is a blessing in the world we live today. \n\nThank You Sir for your care so far. We all look forward to remain in contact with you for any medical support in future (though I pray we do not need you :):)\n\nRegards\nZafar ",
