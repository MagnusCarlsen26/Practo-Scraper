None,None,0,0,YES,"With or without the CGHS panel, I have had the privilege of being under Dr.Sanjay Dhall’s care for years after years. I can speak highly enough of his commitment, expertise, and genuine concern for his patients' health. Apart from clinical expertise, his approach to patient care goes beyond the ordinary, amidst an incidence of exemplary diagnoses, cost-cutting, and fast relief. If needed, I can substantiate all these with my experiences. I believe that throughout my interactions with Dr. Dhall, I always felt valued as patients or attendants at his his Suraksha Clinic Rana Pratap Bagh, Max Hospital Pitampura  and later Max Shalimar Bagh..

In light of my positive experiences, I am disheartened to witness an individual resorting to practo.com to express grievances against healthcare professionals like Dr. Sanjay Dhall. In our opinion, such actions undermine the integrity of the medical profession and fail to acknowledge the tireless dedication that doctors like Dr. Dhall invest in their patients. 

As a satisfied patient or attendant under Dr.Sanjay Dhall’s care for several years, I am compelled to attest to his unwavering commitment, exceptional competence, and genuine dedication to patient well-being.
