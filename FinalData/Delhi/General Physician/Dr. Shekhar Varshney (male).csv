None,"Bronchial Asthma Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Doctor didn’t explain the root cause of my problem or any of the medication that he prescribed.
Any explanation he offered was on asking pointed questions only.
He didn’t enquire if I was even comfortable with rotacaps he prescribed. I have been using inhalers for a very long time and the last time I used a rotacap was probably 20 years ago. He changed it to an inhaler only upon being asked about what he had prescribed.
He straight  up sent me for an in-clinic PFT that was for ₹1000. The device was some kind of a mobile contraption and without a pressure chamber which is typical of a PFT which I have got done in the past. It seemed overpriced and I was uncomfortable shelling out an additional amount for this kind of a test.
Asthma patients typically have a lot of allergies and possible aggravating factors. Without investigating much about my lifestyle or context, the doctor was quick to insinuate I should consider giving up my pets who have been around me much longer than my current breathing problem. No consideration to my recent travel to a city with a much lower temperature and high humidity, or sudden increase in stress, or dietary habits, or any other factors I may have been exposed to.

To summarise, I was quite unsatisfied with my experience at his clinic and he seems to be the kind of doctor who likes to prescribe without much attention to the context of his patients, is low on empathy and holds back on investigating/explaining the root cause, or the the medication he prescribes.",2024-06-12 03:26:09,False,False,Shradha Pathya,"Thanks for your valuable feedback!!
