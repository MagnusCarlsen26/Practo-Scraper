"Treatment satisfaction,","Sports Medicine,",0,0,YES,"Visited Dr. Bhim Singh for shoulder pain on April 2nd, 2023. I live a few meters away from BLK MAX SUPER SPECIALITY HOSPITAL PUSA ROAD and hence first visited DR Gulshan Kapoor, an ortho consultant of BLK MAX hospital, on 28/3/2023. DR Gulshan Kapoor prescribed some medicine but was not interested in my problems nor suggested any exercise plan or future course of action.

But after visiting Dr. Bhim Singh, it would be unfair if I didn't share my experience with him. After patiently listening to my problems, he said that it was not a serious issue. ( I knew it was not a serious issue, but I wanted to know more about it) He prescribed some medicine and promised to send an email with the details of the exercise to be done. I received his mail with all the exercise details in a Word file with pictures and video links.

Further, he cleared all my doubts and encouraged me to clear all my silly doubts before leaving. As I had to go to the Airport, I requested the receptionist to allow me to meet the doctor asap, and she and the doctor obliged.

My sincere gratitude to Dr. Bhim for such a caring attitude and patience. If anyone suffers from ortho-related problems, I strongly suggest consulting Dr. Bhim once before meeting other doctors to save your time money and peace of mind. Anil Varghese.

None,None,0,0,YES,My father was having knee pain which later was diagnosed as osteoarthritis. I was advised to go for knee replacement for him. But we were apprehensive about going for surgery for him being diabetic and hypertensive. Someone near to us recommended Dr bhim to consult once and he explained the condition and treatment options to us so nicely that we were convinced to give mon surgical treatment a chance. With stem cell therapy and exercise protocol with supervised treatment. He is now free of pain and now able to walk and do activity by himself which he was not able to do before.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Sports Injury Treatment/Management,",0,0,YES,"I had a AC joint sprain for past 3 months. I tried everything including physiotherapies and some rehab exercises. But still I wasn’t able to lift weights without the pain. Even doctors were pretty generic about their explanation regarding this issue, most of them just shut me down by saying just let your shoulder heal by rest and physio which I did for more than 3 months. It worked but it did not resolved my issue of lifting weights pain free. Luckily I came across Dr Singh Bhim, he patiently listened everything regarding my pain and explained everything. Moreover unlike other doctors his advice was not generic “just rest and do physio” and his treatment focused on healing while actively working out which worked perfectly for me. Now my AC joint feels good, matter of fact I’ve been progressing in the gym each week. ",2022-06-27 06:31:41,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
