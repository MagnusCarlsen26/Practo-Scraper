He really understood my problems, and put me on medication than advising me directly to take an endoscopy test and further advised me to follow up in a month and I like that idea. It's not 100% cured, but I am almost recovered and am very much thankful to him. Thank you very much for being a very humble doctor.",

He is friendly and to the point and also expalins the problem in detail. The second consultation was for myself and again he treated me in a weeks time with medications only and no tests. I had consulted 2 other doctors before going to him and they were not able to cure my gastro and intestinal infection problem.I recommend the doctor. 5 stars. You may feel he is a bit expensive but it is totally worth it. ",
