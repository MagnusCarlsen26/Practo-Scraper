My Father In Law was admitted in Manipal Hospital Dwarka. 

Its my humble request to patient families, please if u love ur family member.. 
Dont go to Manipal hospital. 

Overall Ambience is good but if we talk about room, washroom cleanings**  *** **** * * * * 
If we talk about lab reports, its simply speechless..  Wrong reports ( We pointed out Dr. Rajender Singh..  Dr Sahab reports theek hain kya.  He replied, oh it wonderful, patient recovery is awesome.  I said how is it possible that HB level can increase 7 points in a day, Dr reply was.  Its machine Galti sey aa gyaa hoga.  I said KFT reports bhi toh galat ho sakti hai so he replied nahi woh nahi hogi.  )

Later too, its a long story.
