Today not just even walking but I can run, jump, do exercises all by myself. Dance was my passion but I stopped dancing all because I could not dance with so much pain but with his treatment I don't stop dancing now... Thank you so much Dr. Naveen for being a god in human's face. *** *** ******** although he is a physician but he is an all-rounder he can treat anything and anyone \u2764\ufe0f I was blessed to have a doctor like him who treats his patients like his own family...\nThank you \ud83e\udd0d",
