It is unfortunate if you felt that way. Lets revisit the circumstances to help us in clearing this misunderstanding. I would be happy to see you again and explain at length as well if you want. You had visited for the first time on 27 December when a detailed neurological examination had been carried out and you had been advised some tests and asked to return in 10 days for a follow up visit. You returned after two months on 27 February, and without the tests that had been advised earlier. Although I would disagree with you that the consultation lasted for 10 seconds (it takes longer than that to take a pen and write your name on the prescription), it was certainly shorter than the previous consultation and you were advised to start the medicines again, get the required tests and return after 10 days (not 40). I will be happy to answer any other queries or doubts you may have on personal messages/calls or visits. My best regards to you. Get well soon.  I am totally committed to the care and well being if my patients and its very unusual for someone to say I see them in a rushed way. Usually my patients feel the consults are too long. ☺️ I would have been happy to have a long consult or call with you as well if you had only asked, instead of this. A Doctor Patient relationship is very special and I am not very comfortable going public with this entire issue, but I think this is how these modern times are.
