"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"There are no adequate words to express my heartfelt appreciation for Dr. Sanchayan Roy. He brought back my mother from a near-vegetative state to her usual buoyant self. During a span of three years, my 80-year-old mother fractured both sides of her hip; had an infected gallbladder that had to be removed; was diagnosed with Parkinson’s; suffered from dementia, and silently slid into deep depression. She stopped talking and eating, became immobilized and was unable to control her bodily fluids. Dr. Roy steered back her cognitive skills and with his team rebuilt her broken physical strength. Today she is walking, attending philosophy classes and taking an active interest in life. Dr. Sanchayan Roy returned my mother back to us!

Additionally, Dr. Roy is an excellent geriatric care doctor who combines short-term health problems with long-term continuum of care. He coordinated my mother’s myriad medications for multiple age-related ailments to create a comprehensive health picture. Based on this he generated a preventive care regime that he enforces by reminding family members to act on it. His continuous care gives us hope that we might be able to mitigate some of my mother’s anticipated health issues by replacing it with a better quality of life. Dr. Roy truly takes his Hippocratic oath seriously (a rare quality these days).

Having experienced healthcare in many parts of the world, I can say without hesitation that our experience with Dr. Roy ranks among the best, and I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending him to my friends and to their aging parents.

I’ve seen him at multiple clinics , and every single time (this is the 5th time) , the appointment has to be rescheduled or there’s an immense wait.

In addition to that, there are multiple minor issues that have added up. Because of a misspelt name and incorrect date on a prescription (by the doctor) I had to argue at the pharmacy for more than 30 minutes to get medications.

Again, no real problems with Dr. Roy. But if you’re a busy person, or you have scheduling problems , I can’t recommend him.
