The causes of backache are several and so to eliminate systemic problems certain tests are required. Regarding diagnostic centre it was a suggestion only as it was nearby but cost is completely dependent on the diagnostic centre. Also if you felt it was expensive there was no compulsion to get test done from the place. You are always free to choose any diagnostic centre of your own choice.
          As far consultation fees it is a structured thing that is followed for every patient. Your first consultation was on 1st August and next on 6th August. I charge consultation fees again on the fifth day. If you had any problem with it you should have enquired or told me at that time. We could have easily settled the issue. Still if there was any error in calculating the days from my staff, I am sorry but otherwise it is a norm for every patient. 
           I am sorry that you had a bad experience but we wish that you had expressed your concern at that time so that any misunderstanding could have been easily resolved.

But more amused to know that after 2 years of pandemic the essence of prevention hasn't yet dawned upon us. Clinic is a place where symptomatic, infected and non infected cases come. The physical barrier is to screen and  understand the problems before examining to be able to segregate the infected from non infected patients. Covid appropriate behaviour shouldn't be tagged as 'scared', it shows lack of awareness. Anyway I don't remember the details of tests but I guess it is a matter of opinion regarding what is necessary and what isn't. Anyway I am sorry if you  found it unnecessary but I recommend what is generally necessary.",2022-02-22T11:11:39+0000,Dr. Sanchayan Roy

"Wait time,",,0,0,NO,"**** ***** *** *** ** * **** ******* The treatment more or less was fine. I’ve seen him at multiple clinics , and every single time (this is the 5th time) , the appointment has to be rescheduled or there’s an immense wait. I understand, doctors are busy, you have patients to attend to - but when it happens 5 times in a row that you’re rescheduling  (in advance) then there’s clearly an issue. 

In addition to that, there are multiple minor issues that have added up. Because of a misspelt name and incorrect date on a prescription (by the doctor) I had to argue at the pharmacy for more than 30 minutes to get medications.

Again, no real problems with Dr. Roy. But if you’re a busy person, or you have scheduling problems , I can’t recommend him.  You almost certainly will not get to actually get your appointment on time.",2021-08-07 08:05:09,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hi, sad to know about your inconvenience.
