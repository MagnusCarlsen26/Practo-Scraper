None,None,0,0,YES,"So I came across Doctor Rajesh Kansal through Practo. Then I checked his google reviews, since it‚Äôs always a bit of uncertainty trying on a new Doctor. However when I met with doctor Rajesh he was really humble and friendly and not like other doctors to put stress on a patient‚Äôs mental health. He didn‚Äôt give me any unnecessary medication or tests. Just told me certain changes in diet and day to day life to fix my issues. Highly recommended doctor for anyone looking for a good doctor in Delhi.
