None,None,0,0,YES,"Whenever I visit a doctor, I focus more on how well he/she listens to my problems, rather than simply taking the prescriptions, and that Dr Vivek Raj actually made me felt like a good listener, very much down to earth. He really understood my problems, and put me on medication than advising me directly to take an endoscopy test and further advised me to follow up in a month and I like that idea. It's not 100% cured, but I am almost recovered and am very much thankful to him. Thank you very much for being a very humble doctor.",2016-05-23 15:49:05,False,True,K S Ngachanwon,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,*** ***** *** ** *** ** *** *** ******* ** ****** * ***** *** ** ** ****** ** We have consulted him on two occasions. The first consultation was for my mother and 2 other hospitals could not treat the intestinal infection. Dr. Vivek Raj with one weeks medication and few tests treated my mother. He is friendly and to the point and also expalins the problem in detail. The second consultation was for myself and again he treated me in a weeks time with medications only and no tests. I had consulted 2 other doctors before going to him and they were not able to cure my gastro and intestinal infection problem.I recommend the doctor. 5 stars. You may feel he is a bit expensive but it is totally worth it. ,2021-09-21 09:22:53,False,True,Amit Sharma,,,
