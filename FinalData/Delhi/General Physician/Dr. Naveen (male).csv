None,None,0,0,YES,"I had severe leg problem which was almost near to Rickets, I couldn't even walk properly but then Dr. Naveen came in the picture he turned my life into a bliss, he treated me with so much patience and optimism... Today not just even walking but I can run, jump, do exercises all by myself. Dance was my passion but I stopped dancing all because I could not dance with so much pain but with his treatment I don't stop dancing now... Thank you so much Dr. Naveen for being a god in human's face. *** *** ******** although he is a physician but he is an all-rounder he can treat anything and anyone ‚ù§Ô∏è I was blessed to have a doctor like him who treats his patients like his own family...
