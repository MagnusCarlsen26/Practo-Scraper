‚ÄúMedicine cure diseases but only doctors can cure patients.‚Äù
This goes so well appropriate to Dr. Nandini.
I consulted her for my entire family when we caught COVID on May2 2021 when the whole country was terrified and before talking to her I was completely blank like what to do and what not do to.
She treated us well not only with the medicines but also with her assurance and positive words, even though we were communicating online still felt as personal touch. Always up for resolving queries and anxiety (which is the most bad thing I felt during covid).
