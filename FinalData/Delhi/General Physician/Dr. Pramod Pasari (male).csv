None,None,0,0,YES,"my mother got operated in blk hospital for a fracture in right leg (intertrochanteric fracture). Post this unfortunate incident, the only good thing I was looking for a good doctor to operate my mother. And we got Dr Pramod assigned to this case from emergency. He is a very nice human being and such a patient listener. I have troubled him a lot during surgery, post surgery and day to day issues. There was not even a single instance when he acted like a doctor, he stayed like an extended family member. Highly unexpected as lot of other doctors at blk stay in their own imaginary world of superiority. He was always willing to pick my call and guide us even if that is just a regular consolation. I visited 2 times post my surgery and even though more senior doctor was available but I want to wait for him only - does not matter how long I have to wait. Thank you sir, I do not think I can be of any use/help to you. But if i can ever be of any help, I would consider myself lucky. lots of love and respect.",2021-12-25 07:33:11,False,True,Tarun Gupta,,,
