,,0,0,YES,"He is one miraculous doctor, a blessing to people in Delhi ncr with immense knowledge & expertise in his field. When i saw every physician of Jaipur failing to cure the recurring high fever (104) of my mother since 2.5 months, i went to him with high hopes in Max Shalimar bagh through Dr Alok Kalyani. He took his time and gone through all Ct scans endless blood reports which all were correct showing no sign of any infection, then suggested Pet- ct also which showed no sign of malignancy. He didn‚Äôt left hope after that also and was prompt in suggesting a test for Brucella which was the only reason for high prolonged fever. Brucella is rare and i wonder when will Jaipur physicians learn about this.?! I doubt there profession as they had putted every drug for fever. 
I was aback by Nagrani Sir competence as a General Physician, a big salute to such a humble & senior doctor who was risking his life coming into the room of the patient during covid to do his duty. Big thanks to him for saving us where we hardly had hopes about how the fever will stop, jaipur doctors (ehcc, soni hospital) showed up the bills of 9 lacs without any cure. He came out as a blessing for us, can never thank him enough for saving my mom. üôèüôå
And also big thanks to Dr. Alok kalyani for taking me to the best. üëè
