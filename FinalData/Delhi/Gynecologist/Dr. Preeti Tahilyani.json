My delivery was also done in emergency situation but I am so so sooo grateful...to Dr Preeti for her timely availability and prompt intervention that helped in successful NVD within half n hr of reaching the hospital. I felt like it was God in her form at that time. she is always motivating, explains things well, gives her time and is v patient. She is an expert in her field. Even post delivery, she counsels well on any issues we are facing and guides just like a family member. Don't have enough words to express my gratitude. She is just a wonderful Dr.Once again I would like to say,,, go for Dr Preeti if someone is looking for a good Obs n Gynae in Dwarka. ",

My delivery was also done in emergency situation but I am so so sooo grateful...to Dr Preeti for her timely availability and prompt intervention that helped in successful NVD within half n hr of reaching the hospital. I felt like it was God in her form at that time. she is always motivating, explains things well, gives her time and is v patient. She is an expert in her field. Even post delivery, she counsels well on any issues we are facing and guides just like a family member. Don't have enough words to express my gratitude. She is just a wonderful Dr.Once again I would like to say,,, go for Dr Preeti if someone is looking for a good Obs n Gynae in Dwarka. ",

In just few days I recovered and I am so happy that I am blessed with a healthy baby boy. I feel really fortunate to be under the experienced hands of Dr. Preeti.

I felt at ease because of her friendly yet practical approach. Despite having so many years of experience, mam can develop good rapport with young patients as well. \nLuckily there were no complications in my pregnancy. And I followed the doctor's advice closely to avoid any unprecedented conditions. \nFew days before the delivery, lockdown due to Corona was enforced. But Preeti mam was available for consultation at the hospital during limited OPD hours, as well as over phone. The c-section delivery itself was done very smoothly, along with follow ups. \nI felt mentally prepared and well-informed at all stages, and would highly recommend Dr. Preeti to young mothers who are planning for the baby. The ob-gynae team at Venkateshwar Hospital was extremely supportive. ",
