You consulted us when your mother was operated at our centre. Being a far off patient we thought you have discontinued your visits. Even all whatsapp chats also didnt give any hint about any dissatisfaction. We are attached to Apollo for all emergencies as its open 24 by 7. Many times its not possible to advise on whatsapp without proper examination of patient. You were sufferring from hyperemesis gravidarum during first trimester of your pregnancy. We tried our best to tackle it with medicines and syrups. But majority of such cases need hospitalisation for proper care of mother and fetus. We hope you must have delivered by now. Best wishes for you and your little angel. \nTake Care\n\nPriya \nCoordinator \nDr Vaishali Sharma MD(AIIMS)",

While I do appreciate the importance of emergency protocols, I must express my frustration with this response as it did not effectively address my queries or concerns.\n\nUnfortunately, due to this recurring issue, I have made the decision to seek care from another doctor. I believe it is crucial for patients to feel heard and understood, especially during times of medical uncertainty.\n\nI will never recommend any mom to be to visit her. Also, I will never recommend anyone to visit her.",

You consulted us when your mother was operated at our centre. Being a far off patient we thought you have discontinued your visits. Even all whatsapp chats also didnt give any hint about any dissatisfaction. We are attached to Apollo for all emergencies as its open 24 by 7. Many times its not possible to advise on whatsapp without proper examination of patient. You were sufferring from hyperemesis gravidarum during first trimester of your pregnancy. We tried our best to tackle it with medicines and syrups. But majority of such cases need hospitalisation for proper care of mother and fetus. We hope you must have delivered by now. Best wishes for you and your little angel. \nTake Care\n\nPriya \nCoordinator \nDr Vaishali Sharma MD(AIIMS)",

                "review_text": "At the age of 36, what was deemed impossible by half-dozen top gynaecologist in Gujarat, made possible by Dr. Vaishali Sharma.\n\nI started my journey with Dr. Vaishali when I was 5 month pregnant. By that time, I was exhausted with leading gynaecology specialist and their below standard Gujarat specific practise (i.e. I called it \u201cfile practise\u201d). My pregnancy was progressing in healthy manner with no symptoms of any complications.\n\nBefore Dr. Vaishali Sharma, my previous  gynaecologist was from Kuwait and her opinion was exactly the same that pregnancy was healthy without any implications of age.\n\nContrary to above, all the doctors I consulted in Gujarat before Dr. Vaishali were looking at my age as sole indictor to book C-section dates months in advance and planning to inject me with different steroids without any reason or risky symptoms. This was shocking for me at the same time created doubts about my previous gynaecologist\u2019s opinion. There was time, when I was almost persuaded into \u201cfile practise\u201d. But to convince myself, I kept searching for gynaecology specialist and Dr. Vaishali was my last hope before I surrender to \u201cfile practise\u201d.\n\u201cFile practise\u201d is coined for treatment system in Gujarat where a file is opened, once pregnant woman visits doctor for first time. And this patient specific file is pre-filled with boxes of appointment, vaccines, injectables, sonograms, supplements, etc. which each patient needs to take regardless of their health condition & body-requirements. It transformed pregnancy to a manufacturing process than an experience of life. And because pregnancy is treated like illness, unwanted medication gives you short term and long term side-effects.\n\nDuring my first visit, my first question to Dr. Vaishali Sharma was how will I deliver baby, normal way or c-section. And her answer with extreme confidence was, we can\u2019t decide anything now dear. Let\u2019s focus on your health and baby health now; and this was very assuring for me. And she does not follow \u201cfile practise\u201d. For her, every patient is unique.\n\nFrom 5th month to 9th month, I was visiting her as when needed  and she was able to check my progress just by examination. Even the sonographic scan was only conducted few times in five months. In terms of vaccination during pregnancy, I tool only 1 during initial times and other towards delivery. In medication, I was only taking vitamins supplements as per the need. In daily food, I was taking all available fruits, vegetables, coconut water and home cooked food. \n\nDuring final weeks, I was visiting her once a week. And when contraction started, we waited for just a day to see the progress. And based on examination and sonography results, she asked me to admit to KD hospital and next day afternoon, I was blessed with angel in my lap. And it was normal delivery at the age of 36. and while I am writing this review, I am back to normal life in just two weeks from delivery date.\n\nOverall, Dr. Vaishali Sharma\u2019s practise is of international standard, simple, convenient and trustworthy. Compared to \u201cGujarat\u2019s file practise\u201d, I was asked to visiting her when needed. Sonography was conducted only when it\u2019s necessary. I was not given any steroids or extra injectables or unnecessary vaccines. And she was reachable by call or message if you see any alarming symptoms.\n\nPractise like above may look very uncaring in Gujarat but in reality, this is an international practise followed by United states and European countries. \n\nMotherhood should not be deemed as  sickness or illness but it\u2019s a beautiful journey of life. It should be cherished with happy moments and your gynaecologist is a companion who guides you throughout the journey. Pregnancy is not to manufacture a baby but it\u2019s a journey of life to get blessings of god in the form of an angel.\n\nI hope this feedback helps proactive mothers making choice about gynaecologist.\n",

The reason behind strong recommendation is that, we are trying to conceive from last 7 years but we didn't get any success. We visited almost all the top Gynaecologist of Delhi NCR, but with no luck. Then we met Dr Vaishali sharma via some known source. She politely explained all treatment in details, gave us plenty of time to speak about our problem and counsel us to get a resolution. And fortunately with her efforts & experience, we are blessed with baby boy dated 1st Nov 2021.\nDuring our entire journey, she make us feel relaxed and calm even in the painful & critical circumstances. She possess great qualities which includes:\n1. Not a money -She always emphasize the important tests only.. After checking scan reports she advise us that the triple marker, quarter marker tests etc. not required... Also during start of our journey she reviewed all blood test reports which are 3 months old & doesn't recommend us to undergone all test again.\n2. To the point approach: During start to end of our journey she explained each & everything clearly with a very transparent approach... \n3. Personal touch: She is a great human being who is having a caring approach towards patient.. Always available on whats app/ call. Have you hear any doctor who is spending time in consoling patient when they are crying. She possess such a great attitude. \nI request to all who are thinking to conceive and not getting success, take appointment of Dr. VAISHALI SHARMA. With God grace you may also got success. \n\nIn the last I just want to say that We have never met a God, but after meeting her we realize that Messenger of God do exists. Thanks Dr VAISHALI for the wonderful gift you have given to us.",

From the moment we stepped into Dr. Vaishali's clinic, her warmth and professionalism put us at ease. Her compassionate demeanor, reassuring words, and willingness to answer all our questions alleviated our anxieties and made us feel confident that our child was in the best hands possible.\n\nDr Vaishali's expertise and dedication were evident in every aspect of my wife's pregnancy. Her ability to diagnose my wife's condition accurately and develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to our needs was truly remarkable. Throughout the process, she kept us well-informed about the progress and any changes in the treatment, allowing us to understand the situation clearly and be actively involved in the decisions.\n\nThank you ma'am from the bottom of our hearts for your exceptional care, expertise, and kindness. You have truly touched our lives, and we are forever grateful.\n\nRegards\nAstha & Nitin",

Her medication healed me so soon even though I had multiple as well as big fibroids.\n\nNot only she was truly amazing with the whole surgery process but she addresses all your queries and doubts with full patience. \nBe it face to face consultation or video consultation, she will not hurry to end the conversation.\nShe empathies with you when you are so anxious about the surgery which makes you trust her and her judgement even more. \nThe best part about her is quick responses during the whole course. You can send her reports on messages and she will revert promptly. You have any concerns/emergency and she will provide quick resolution.  I live in a different city so can\u2019t meet face to face for everything but with her it\u2019s not difficult.\nPersonal attention and treating patient with care is something I respect her for.\nBlessed to have come in contact with Dr. Vaishali and will always see her for any gynaecological reasons in future.\n\nWon\u2019t miss an opportunity to appreciate her team member, Ms. Priya. She will be available round the clock and will get things done super quick. Booking appointments, paper work of surgery, finding medicines etc . She assists you with everything.\n\n\n",

Reason behind strong recommendation is, we were trying to convince from last 8yrs but we did not get any success. We change many doctors but no luck. Then we decided to go with milann fertility center where we met Dr vaishali as our doctor.\nShe is really great human being with her great experience. She explained us all treatments in details with each phase. And fortunately with her efforts and experience, we got success in first cycle of IVF and after successful 9months, we blessed with a cute and healthy BABY BOY with 3kg weight.\nDuring process, we learnt along with process that we as patient should keep a lot of patience through out process till end and result.\nI request to all who are thinking to concieve and not getting success, take appointment of Dr vaishali. For sure you guys will get success by keeping patience.\nThanks a lot Dr vaishali. I, my wife and my family is too much happy which we get as unbelievable gift from God",

I came in with acute pelvic pain which was growing with time since 3-4 months. Dr Sharma immediately sent me for investigations and endometrial cyst was discovered which had to be operated through laparoscopy. Dr sharma gave us her genuine guidance in selecting the hospital and details about the procedure as she herself did the procedure. Everything went smoothly , she is a very helpful, polite, friendly, genuine doctor. Cares about the patients' time and finances. You can freely talk ma'am and ask anything, she is very approachable. All in all it was an excellent experience and I am okay in just a week. ",

We were told that we will get the report on WhatsApp but it turns out I only got it after multiple calls - the reports were available at the clinic but no one bothered to contact us. At the clinic I was told that the doctor will tell us of the findings in the report but that also did not happen. I've been calling for 2 days but no one seems interested. I don't think visiting the clinic proved beneficial for me especially when you are paying premium prices.",

We came to know about Dr Vaishali through internet... we visited her as she is from AIIMS... She also convinced us that surgery is possible for removal of tumour only.

Not only the in depth knowledge of her subject but also her thirst to learn advance techniques in the field and help her patients as per their want and needs are something which we rarely find. She gives you all the information, right from minute detailing to how to take care of your health during your whole treatment or pregnancy she is there to guide you at every step. Apart from her medical expertise, she is a kind, caring and loving person. Her confident smile makes you forget how big your problem/medical issue is and you feel that you have landed in the most advanced and yet comfortable place. If you are suffering from any gynaecological issues, this place should be your first choice. And you will thank yourself that you chose her. An amazing doctor and caring woman.\nThanks for being there doctor Sharma.\nCompliments\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\ude4f",

She proffers a cradle of confidence backed by her knowledge in her field, the skill and expertise she has  garnered from her experience and by her world class alma matter. \n\nMy husband and I were apprehensive to embark on this new journey due to our special needs and conditions. My husband is differently abled and I have a condition of Spina bifida. We had found Dr. Vaishali after a thorough search. And based on her reputation and great reviews, we approached her and discussed our condition in detail. I still remember the patience and poise with which she listened to us. She quelled our apprehensions and gave us apt guidance to move forward with our objective. She gives periodic consultation and takes care of our special needs. The journey so far has been smooth and comfortable under her.\n\nHer association with a good network of branded and recognised hospitals in Delhi makes her approachable and gave us options.\n\nAs a couple, we see her as our guiding light. We have been obliged by her support in our journey to branch out our little family with a new little angel. The sense of calm and poise that she has lent to us as a couple has made this journey easier and joyful.\n\nWithout a doubt and with great elan, we can recommend Dr. Vaishali Sharma to any one who is looking for a professional yet friendly companion throughout their journey. \n\nShe is like an angel by our side!

She answered all my queries patiently and heard me out till the end of my visit. \n\nShe is a young doctor who knows about the modern-day technologies to rule out any possibility of a problem. She conducted a quick test on me to explain certain facts about my issue which shows she was quick to take action as well as responsive. \n\nAt the end, she was sensitive to my needs and assured me of any help required at any time. Her assistant, Shrijana Gurung, was very helpful and polite while conducting the session.\n\nWould certainly recommend her and would be going to her soon. \n\n",

                "reply_text": "I am really sorry for your loss but your wife's negative blood group with your's positive blood group causes a disease which is not good for baby's growth. This usually aggravates after each and every pregnancy. This was yours 5th pregnancy so condition has already deteriorated a lot. It will be worse in next pregnancy if you plan. If you haven't had taken abortion pills for that unwanted pregnancy then risk would have been lesser.\n Besides, deterioration of egg quality with age also leads to higher risk of miscarriage due to development of abnormal embryos. Also you had a past history of positive TORCH infection for which you already have undergone treatment for a year. I tried to explain these reasons but I know it's really difficult for a layman to understand them. As far as solution is concerned, treatment options are there for all these problems which we usually offer to childless couples, as efforts and costs involved will not be worth in your scenario I suppose, considering the fact that you already  have a perfectly healthy beautiful daughter. Even then if you wish to proceed further we will be delighted to help you. Best wishes for your future. Take Care",
