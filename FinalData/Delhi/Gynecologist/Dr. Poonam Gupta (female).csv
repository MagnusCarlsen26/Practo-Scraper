"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,NO,"We are returning NRIs and visited India in August 2019 where my wife contracted stomach infection and high fever with accompanying lose motions.We went to Max patparganj on a saturday and there was no specialist available to see her at 11am in the morning and had to resort to getting her admitted in their Emergency room where they just took blood at the start of admission and post admittance nobody looked at her for 4 hours straight and neither did they share the result of the report till i asked them to discharge her. Mind you, no doctor visisted her in the ER even once or no medicines administered..even paracetomal was not given to her for 4 hours when her fever was reported to be 103 degress at admission. Finally i got her discharged against medical advice as doctors did not want to releass her despite not attending to her. Apparently ER costs are charged per hour. Cherry on the cake was a cost of Rs.9800 for ***** blood test for stomach infection which we had to pay in order to get discharge. *** **** ***** **** ***** ****** **** **** ******* **** ** *** ***** ********* *** ** ************ HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER DECENT OPTION. ****** ** ** * ********** ********* **** **** ****** *********** ******* *** ****** ******* ***** ****** *** **** * ****** ******** ** * ******* **** *****.I personally dont mind paying if i get proportionate and quality service which is nonexistent in this case.",2020-01-17 22:40:09,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,"I was coordinating with Dr. Poonam Gupta for my first time pregnancy, bot only she is cold- hearted but also very rude. She never bothered to answer any of my questions and always insisted to visit her in her clinic. Lastly, I’d to move to my parents place as ny sister-in-law gynae was very soft spoken and used to answer all her doubts.

I’d strongly recommend not to go to her.",2020-12-23 09:19:42,False,False,Jasleen,,,

None,None,0,0,NO,She is arrogant and rude. She got furious upon seeing the the medical history reports from another hospital and said why have you come here. Didn't even examine and told to get the surgery done from another hospital as she doesn't have time. She didn't even care to explain the reason for surgery. Would not recommend her if you want overall satisfaction. She might be experienced but doesnt have the courtesy or the patience with the patient. Extremely disappointed with her behaviour and arrogance. ,2022-10-10 13:30:03,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
