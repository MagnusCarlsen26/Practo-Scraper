None,"Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"*** **** ** *** ** *** **** ************ *** **** ** *****. She always puts her patient at ease . I started  visiting her around late August as i had some complications in my pregnancy, from day one she treated me as her own and put me at ease. She guided me throughout my  pre and post delivery. Dr. Alka is not a stereotype like other doctors who follows same procedure for all  patients. She understands that every pregnant lady is different to others. Dr. alka definitely knows what type of delivery a pregnant lady needs in her situation. In today's hospital industry she is not at all bounded by the pressure. 
Now a days we have so many doctors but every would be mother wants to feel secure in every aspect related to her baby and Dr. Alka has the ability to provide that  undoubtedly. She only suggests what is good for you and your baby and not the irrelevant stuff to exceed the bill. If she is asking for a test, it means it is IMPORTANT.
Dr. Alka is very empathetic in nature and understands the financial conditions of her patients which I personally feel is a very important aspect.
In person, she is very nice  and easy going as far as i got to know about her through my appointments.
23rd sept 2016 was my delivery day, she handed me my beautifull dream, my love my baby girl. Before I met her I was scared about so many things. But with her I was not scared at all in the labour room and I was sure my baby would be  safe in her hands. 
I think it would be an understatement to say that Dr. Alka transformed  my complicated pregnancy into a beautifull dream.
