Before sharing my experience with ma’am, I want to wholeheartedly thank her for constantly being there for me in my pregnancy journey . I approached her in  March’23 where after a blood test my pregnancy was confirmed. I was too anxious than happy because i was not prepared mentally for it, was overweight and also had ligament tear in my foot with constant swelling.

I had a high risk pregnancy with my BP shooting up randomly. I was prescribed medicines as per requirement and was asked to monitor my Bp. Whenever i had any issues, i used to call or wtz app her, and trust me on this, SHE WAS ALWAYS AVAILABLE!!! no matter what hour of the day it was, she always replied! I had complete faith on her and followed whatever she prescribed. On 15th October, my Bp went too high with non stop vomiting.I called her and told her the same, she asked me to rush to the hospital immediately where I delivered a baby girl in her safe hands! Words will never be enough to express my gratitude to her, she is like a godly figure in my life. At a time when i did not trust myself, she gave me that faith and helped me constantly.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"This might be a long review but worth reading, if you are worried choosing a good doctor for you through the roller coaster journey of pregnancy. 

I was blessed with a baby girl on 24th November 2021, under the care of Dr. POOJA CHOUDHARY.

So, The day i got to know i was pregnant, more than being happy , i was depressed because of being judged by a doctor as i was (very much) overweighed.

I went through tonns of social platforms, reviews, ratings and finally thought to meet 'Dr. Pooja Choudhary'. But i assured myself visit 2-3 doctors and choosing the one who judged my body less.

We booked an appointment on practo and finally the day came. I met her first with a feeling of terror in me thinking-she would ask why did i plan a baby before shedding some weight. But to my surprise she welcomed us with such a positive attitude and gesture that my first visit itself gave me such motivation towards being a plus size healthy mother♥ no judgments were made at all , which made me think positive and have a healthy pregnancy.

And yes the decision of meeting 2-3 doctors and choosing one among them also strictly changed. This was indeed the first moment  i felt happy for my baby coming soon.

She has been a true blessing for me throughout this period pregnancy as well as post pregnancy, she was only a call away 24*7, every doubt and every query was answered very politely, anytime in the day or night. More than a doctor, she will be your mother, your elder sister, your friend. She trully has a golden heart.

Today i can proudly say, i made the best choice that helped me go very smooth throught this tough phase of life.

Kudos to the best doctor in town....!!!!",2021-12-28 14:19:45,False,True,Ankita  Sourabh  Juneja,"Thank you Ankita , for such a heartfelt warm response . Many thanks for your appreciation. God bless you all !",2021-12-29T06:57:12+0000,Dr. Pooja Choudhary
