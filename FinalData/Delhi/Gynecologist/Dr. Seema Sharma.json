An accident, nearly 1.5 years old, resulted in cartilage rupture in both my knees that had not healed and was posing a challenge during this phase. Thus began my search for a gynaecologist in whom I could trust and find support towards the last phase of pregnancy especially when the injury was adding to the difficulty of the last phase along with other health issues. I came across Dr Sharma's profile and set an appointment during the first week of October. In the first meeting itself her expertise and warmth both became evident and gave me the confidence that I was in good hands. The check-ups accompanied by her guidance made it easier. The big decision regarding a normal or C-sec delivery was the big question that was due to be decided. Dr Sharma at all times gave me practical advice and told me about cases which would give me more clarity while taking my decision. At 36 weeks only (in the morning only when my baby was born), I had dialated 2.5 cm (the usual being 1 cm at that stage) and was told that the delivery could happen any minute. The same evening, I went into labour and now came the hour of decision. Keeping in mind factors like pressure on my knees, duration of my last stage of labour and the injury happening again due to the pressure, a decision for a C-sec was taken. Her smiling face and her motherly touch on the face right before undergoing that operation in the OT among unknown faces and unexpected circumstances, was a big consolation. The result, a healthy baby in my arms.I just want to take this opportunity to extend a big Thank You to Dr Sharma for being there not at as a medical practitioner alone but as a support, a doctor with a human touch that is difficult to find in today's time.",

It was our first interaction and thought she would be considerate to all our queries, which were not many bdw, but she only answered the first few questions properly, rest all she dodged which made us sense as if she has to rush and wrap up her queue of patients.

An accident, nearly 1.5 years old, resulted in cartilage rupture in both my knees that had not healed and was posing a challenge during this phase. Thus began my search for a gynaecologist in whom I could trust and find support towards the last phase of pregnancy especially when the injury was adding to the difficulty of the last phase along with other health issues. I came across Dr Sharma's profile and set an appointment during the first week of October. In the first meeting itself her expertise and warmth both became evident and gave me the confidence that I was in good hands. The check-ups accompanied by her guidance made it easier. The big decision regarding a normal or C-sec delivery was the big question that was due to be decided. Dr Sharma at all times gave me practical advice and told me about cases which would give me more clarity while taking my decision. At 36 weeks only (in the morning only when my baby was born), I had dialated 2.5 cm (the usual being 1 cm at that stage) and was told that the delivery could happen any minute. The same evening, I went into labour and now came the hour of decision. Keeping in mind factors like pressure on my knees, duration of my last stage of labour and the injury happening again due to the pressure, a decision for a C-sec was taken. Her smiling face and her motherly touch on the face right before undergoing that operation in the OT among unknown faces and unexpected circumstances, was a big consolation. The result, a healthy baby in my arms.I just want to take this opportunity to extend a big Thank You to Dr Sharma for being there not at as a medical practitioner alone but as a support, a doctor with a human touch that is difficult to find in today's time.",

She started my treatment and I got pregnant in July 2022 and throughout my pregnancy she guided me very well. I would recommend Seema mam to everyone. By God's grace and Seema Mam's treatment I am blessed with a baby boy in March 2023. I had complications in my pregnancy but she handled and advised the **** treatment. I m really thankful to you.",

It was our first interaction and thought she would be considerate to all our queries, which were not many bdw, but she only answered the first few questions properly, rest all she dodged which made us sense as if she has to rush and wrap up her queue of patients. And the consultation fees was no less either, so the least we expected was good 15-20 mins of qualitative conversation with her.

The doctor was so professional and explained how to carefully proceed with this pregnancy basis my previous history. I had followed each of her instructions carefully and after eights months , I had a beautiful baby girl in my arms. We are grateful to her for this angel. Even when i was admitted for observation in apollo cradle, she made sure that I am at great ease and proceed with normal delivery considering I already had 2 abortions and labour pain was unbearable. I 100 percent recommend her services for other parents-to-be and couples facing issues in conceiving or female health related issues. ",

I have no solution to my infection or no explanation for my pain.more than money I regret my time being wa s t ed and delay in treatment *** ** *********** will have to see another doctor now.
