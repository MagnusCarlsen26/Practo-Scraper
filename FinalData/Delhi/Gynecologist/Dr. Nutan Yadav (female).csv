None,"Pregnant Women Counseling,",0,0,YES,"I am consulting Dr. Nutan from a long time now for my wife's pregnancy's counseling it was first in year 2009 when we came in contact with her first time in Bensups hospital (Visiting Sr. Doctor for Gyane.) the overall experience was enriching with the final delivery of our first child in year 2010. 
After a long time then again we searched for her and came in touch recently for our 2nd pregnancy counseling in 2016 again the timely advice and guidance was beneficial for us with the second delivery of our child again under her supervision.

I would say that she has very hands on and demonstrated experience of handling pregnancy related issues/problems also she is quite good in building the rapport with the patient which is very important for making them comfortable.

We are happy as a couple to reach out to Dr. Nutan.
Thanks Doc!!
