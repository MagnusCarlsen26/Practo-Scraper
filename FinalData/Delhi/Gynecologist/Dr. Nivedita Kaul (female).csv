They say, God cannot be everywhere, so He sent the doctors with excellence and selflessness. 

The aforesaid unequivocally holds true in case of Dr.Nivedita Kaul.

I have known Dr. Kaul for almost 9 years now, at the time when she was at the beginning of her career and was assisting one senior doctor. At that time, I used to visit the senior doctor for my routine check-ups and Dr. Kaul would be the one who would initially take patient briefings. Even then, I was so fascinated with her pleasing personality and the way she would interact with her patients. 

Little did I know that one day, she’d be the one who would bring our little bundle of joy into this world, hence, filling our lives with happiness in abundance. 

If you are trying to conceive or are expecting, you want a doctor who you can trust and with whom conversations come naturally. With whom you can be yourself and talk your heart out. You’re looking for a confidante you can feel comfortable with, who’ll be there through important and personal aspects of your life. You should be able to talk openly and honestly about your worries and plans, and leave feeling understood, confident about your next steps together. You want someone who can paint the entire big picture before you and tell you what exactly you are going through. Someone who is just a call away. 

Keeping all this in mind, Dr. Nivedita’s name is the first name that would come to my mind. So, I always wanted to consult her for my pregnancy but due to long distance, we were a bit skeptical. 

So, we initially started consulting a gynae in our vicinity. But I was never fully satisfied. I would always tell my husband that I don’t feel connected to our gynae and I don’t feel happy after each of our visit. But since there were no complications as such, we continued. 

However, during fifth month of my pregnancy (in Feb 2021), I started facing low liquor issues which also started affecting growth of our baby. So, we decided to take second consultation from Dr. Nivedita. We visited her clinic and she explained to us in great detail all our tests and reports.  She told us that there was nothing to worry about and further asked us to keep her in loop going forward. 

Thereafter, due to emergence of second wave of covid, I had to resort to tele and video consultation. I kept Dr. Nivedita abreast with all my tests and reports that were being advised by my other doctor. She would allay all our doubts and fears that would come up each time I had a scan. 

Then, towards the end of May, when I had my Growth and Doppler scan, we were appalled to see that the growth lag had risen to 2.5 weeks which was suggestive of mild asymmetric IUGR and the liquor had further reduced drastically (AFI ~ 8). Moreso, my own body weight  had started reducing. Liquor did not increase despite treatment prescribed by my other gynae. Infact, she had indicated that we might have to deliver the baby in first week of June (Due date: 8.7.21) through caesarean. 

We instantly decided to switch to Dr. Nivedita. 
Dr. Kaul calmed us down and explained to us all the options that were available to us. She prescribed daily IV drips and NST monitoring for a week and then for another week on alternate days. She also asked to increase the protein intake (she said jitna thoos sakte ho, thoos lo, jaan laga do poori :)).

In the next scan, we were happily surprised to see that my liquor had increased and the baby’s weight had also increased to an ok level. 

With her **** ******* ********* *** sensibility and taking full responsibility of the risk involved, she pulled through 20 days, which were sufficient to take me upto 36 weeks and 5 days (to avoid keeping the baby in nursery). 

She called me for physical examination and told us that she had stretched for long enough and that now she would like to bring out the baby. She also told that we could try for normal birth first. 

And yes, finally, we did have a normal birthing experience. I delivered a beautiful baby girl on 21st June, 2021.  I had two wishes - first, to have a healthy baby through normal birth and second to have my husband by my side during the delivery process. I don’t think this would have been possible if it weren’t for Dr. Nivedita. 

The best thing about Dr. Nivedita is that she has such a positive aura and positive approach that even when you are facing certain complications in your pregnancy, you will feel that everything will sort out on it’s own. She has the capability to change the negative situations into positive one ! Also, she has some kind of photographic memory. I don’t know how she manages it, but she mostly remembers details of all her patients. She always answers your calls and replies to your messages. She prescribed only limited and relevant scans, tests and medicines. She is very polite, down to earth and friendly. 

Dr. Nivedita, my husband and I would like to
thank you for everything that you’ve done, for all your support during some really tough times. I mean, “Thank you” doesn’t even begin to cover how we feel. We are thankful beyond words can express. Tears of joy roll down my eyes everytime I think of my entire journey with you. You are an amazing doctor and above all, a beautiful person inside out. *** *** ****** **** ****** 

Whenever we felt anxious or afraid of all the unknowns, all we had to do was talk to you and we knew in our heart that it would all work out. Your ever present compassion, attention to detail, always being available, support and care, amongst several other things provided me and my husband such comfort during the entire pregnancy. You are extremely gifted and talented. You are truly God sent ! 

We may have paid for your fees, but for your kindness we shall forever remain indebted. 

I would like to tell everyone that before you choose your gynae, trust your instinct. My instinct guided me towards Dr. Nivedita. 

I would recommend her strongly for all your gynaecological concerns.",2021-08-26 17:26:24,False,True,Tejasvi Jain,,,

Thought its again a false alarm as I had the similar contraction day before and went for a check at CK birla hospital in night , everything was normal and uterus was relaxed as per the Dr. On duty, so thought I cant make a progress over night for delivering a child,  these contractions will pass in an hour or two as yesterday, although waited patiently. As contraction started shortening and its was a odd time to contact Dr. Still I tried her number and could belive she was able to take calls at this hour , she told me not to panic, reach hospital and she will be there. 
By the time I reached hospital contractions were every 8 to 10mins. They rushed me to labour room and before I could understand anything I was asked to push and special thanks to Dr. Nevidita not only she reached at the hospital as and when called she was a great support thought out my pregnancy and she helped me deliver the child in just 3 push and made this day memorable for lifetime.***** ** *** ** *** **** ** *** **** *** she is clam and composed in high pressure situations , so glad that I came across her and she made it so perfect..

Nine months of my pregnancy could have been a nightmare without your medical supervision as our baby was so weak after chickenpox, I thought that you would be treating me roughly at the time of delivery but I was really wrong.
You came back again in the early morning with your kid when I got unconscious and left your kid in the car for almost one an half hour alone, you also picked up the phone and answered the questions whenever it was required, it shows that how much you are dedicated to your duty.
We are a middle class family and would not be able to give anything more than your fees, however, this is our wholeheartedly thanks and god may give you more success in your career.

I got her reference from my sister-in-law, who again had an amazing experience with her previously. From the very first day, we (my Husband and I) met her, she had been a 24x7 Doctor for us. She used to explain each and everything in such detail, that we actually felt she is like one of us (unlike other Doctors who do not have time to hear our concerns). She had been really patient throughout, handling my anxiety with so much ease. And the best part about her is when she calls you to ask if all is well after you texted her that something is not well. You feel like a priority. I can not thank her enough for how wonderful a guide, friend, family she has been for us. Baby Hinaya is really lucky that she got Dr. Nivedita as her First Doctor!
