None,None,0,0,YES,"My egg wasnâ€™t attached to my uterus and thereby the future of my pregnancy could not be predicted. While most of the doctors told me that my situation was such that there is a very little chance to continue with my pregnancy, Dr Hirday handled my case very well. Not only i delivered a healthy baby, but i delivered my daughter vaginally(since she always pushed me to prefer vaginal delivery than caesarean). Meeting her has been Godâ€™s blessing for me. She is extremely kind and sweet. Always have a smiling face and available on call whenever required.

Wish the best for her always!",2020-05-07 15:00:03,False,True,Megha Shivansh Dandona,,,
