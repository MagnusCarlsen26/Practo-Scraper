"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Endometriosis Treatment,",0,0,YES,He is an amazing doctor. I visited him for my periods pain which I have been getting for years. I explained the doctor about my pain and he told me that I have endrometriosis. I did not give him any ultrasound and any other reports but after few months I did show on my ultrasound that I have this problem. I decided to go for the surgery and I wanted to do it only through him as he was the only doctor could tell me the actual problem and none other could do in so many years. I did go to so many doctors but all they could say is it’s hormonal problem and some women get pain. I was so frustrated all these years for not knowing what’s wrong and why do I need to go through such a severe pain. He did my surgery and it’s been 3 days I’m am recovering. *** * *** *** ** **** ** ** * ********* *************** I am sure I will be feeling much better from now.,2019-12-02 07:46:37,False,True,Madhuri narkhede,,,
