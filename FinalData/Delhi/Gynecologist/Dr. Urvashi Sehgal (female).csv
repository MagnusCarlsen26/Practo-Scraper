"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"We went to Phoenix Hospital for my wife's pregnancy. We had heard amazing feedback about her from my friend who had twins under supervision of Dr. Urvashi Sehgal. I want to touch on the not so good things about the hospital and address why they are fine:1. It really pains to see the negative remarks of some patients here just because they had to wait a little extra to see the doctor. Dr. Sehgal visits every patient in morning (the ones in their last leg of delivery) and she also rushes in case of any delivery or any other issues. As child birth can't be timed and given appointment to, some patients have to wait a little extra at times. I think we need to empathize with the doctor too. Someday, she'd run to get your baby delivered and some patients have to wait for their turn. Sounds fair?2. Interaction with junior doctors before seeing Dr. Sehgal. Well, the junior doctors at Phoenix are not really junior and they go through all your reports, body vitals and prepare notes for Dr. Sehgal so that when she sees you then she's ready with information. We had another doctor in our first trimester and I am telling from experience that some doctors even miss key things. Here, at Phoenix, no such things happen. Once we came here, we got to know so many things of which we were completely unaware. Also, in case you need any emergency support, Phoenix has got your back, there is always a good emergency doctor who can get Dr. Urvashi Sehgal also to come and examine you, if required. 3. One thing where they can improve is access to Dr. Urvashi apart from appointments. Some kind of mechanism should be set up where either Dr. Urvashi or some other doctor can be consulted at a very short notice. Though, we can call emergency doctor but it always gives a moral support if we can speak to OUR doctor. Now the good things about the hospital:1. Cleanliness and hygiene - we visited the hospital way past second covid wave and I haven't seen a single nurse, guard or doctor without a mask. They take extreme precautions and they made even us to get Covid test done. Since it's primarily a maternity hospital, these precautions are really great to have. 2. Great staff - the staff here is simply amazing. They know what you're going through and are very supportive. I had to leave my wife for 2 hours and go out for something really urgent but I always knew that she's in very safe hands..3. Knowledge of Dr. Urvashi - that's class apart. She is very experienced and I'm sure she has seen every kind of pregnancy. My wife had thyroid issues and we were worried about a risky pregnancy but it was very smooth. Thanks to the preparedness of Dr. Urvashi Sehgal.I can assure that if Dr. Urvashi is your doctor during your pregnancy then you are in extremely safe hands and you don't have to worry about anything. God bless her.",2021-10-08 03:55:48,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Tests,",0,0,NO,"here with a reference of one of her friends, who spoke very high of her. But both the times I didn't get any proper appointment and we had paid for Dr. Urvashi's time but most of the time we get the junior doctors to attend at the same cost. Service is also poor, both the receptionists are only good in punching the Debit card, they are good for nothing ( Asha & Priyanka). They had a proper waiting area where they would ask us to wait in car and when doctors will call then only we will again allowed in the area. This is an issue we faced 4 times in a single day. Waiting time is so long that you will definitely lost the track and last but not the least, husband's are not allowed to attend the ultrasound.

A junior Dr first took the detailed history of my pregnancy issues and noted it down ( each minute detail) and then we were sent to meet dr urvashi.
She understood the problem so well and guided through it all .
I must say , it couldn’t have been better for me.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I would like to clear some doubts:: 
Waiting time: 30minutes to 1 hour , wherein it is very clearly asked whether we wish to go for Junior Dr. OR Urvashi Ma'am herself. 
Dr. Urvashi makes sure that unnecessary we don't go for c-sec & if possible tries for Normal delivery
Ma'am is there during the delivery even if it 2 or 4 am at night..witnessed myself & I assume that is the reason why the waiting time at the hospital is more, as she has to at very short notice rush for the normal delivery cases. 
Fooding, Nursing, caretaking staff all were very cooperative & professional 
My husband was allowed for ultrasound during pregnancy & the labour room during the delivery
