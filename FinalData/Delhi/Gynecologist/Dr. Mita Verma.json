Though I undergo tests regularly but Dr\u2019s I consulted never mentioned of my uterus wall was getting thicker from normal. They advised to get DNC , send piece of uterus for testing and post result analyze what need to be done and my condition was deteriorating amid circumstances every day.                                              But then I realised at my age why would I be requiring cleaning and testing of uterus when I can simply get it removed. I was recommended to Dr.Mita Verma . I was frightened and anxious as every doc. I had met was advising the same above but to contrary she not only assured me  surgeryfor removal of uterus would be best course moreover  it should have been the first choice of every doc. Given my age and situation. Any delay in surgery would trigger chances of uterus cancer. Dr. Verma gave her undivided attention during the time of surgery and post surgery whenever I visit her. Till date she is so forth coming in knowing my progress.                   Ladies when it come to health be very cautious. There are some docs who will take you for ride at the cost of your health and will only prescribe medicine and not really heal you. Be careful in choosing your doctor. I am happy to recommend Dr Verma to others and while doing so I am going one step ahead by recommending  a great human being .  I wish others can experience your care and expertise as a doctor as I have . It\u2019s pleasure to know you doctor . ",

However, I was not satisfied, nor I was given proper medication. I was misguided by a doctor here who works in a top hospital (I do not wish to name) last year. The procedures done were just not satisfactory, and it landed up spoiling my health further.\n\nThen, one of my family member, referred Dr Mita (she is in Moolchand Hospital and has a clinic in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi). I met her and the way she explained things (considering first pregnancy), gave me medication, took extra care was incredible. She doesn't recommend extra or unnecessary tests, and always gives logic on what and why she is recommending any procedure or test. She is professional in her approach, yet personal if you are stressed (yes, this is common in pregnancy!). I have been visiting her for 1.5 years, and finally only because of her guidance and support, I\u2019m blessed with a baby boy. She isn\u2019t just a doctor for me, but a well-wisher. On my delivery, she was equally happy, like my family. I will recommend her to everyone who is planning their family, or even have issues related. *** ** *** *********** ***************",

But then I realised at my age why would I be requiring cleaning and testing of uterus when I can simply get it removed. I was recommended to Dr.Mita Verma . I was frightened and anxious as every doc. I had met was advising the same above but to contrary she not only assured me  surgeryfor removal of uterus would be best course moreover  it should have been the first choice of every doc. Given my age and situation. Any delay in surgery would trigger chances of uterus cancer. Dr. Verma gave her undivided attention during the time of surgery and post surgery whenever I visit her. Till date she is so forth coming in knowing my progress.                   Ladies when it come to health be very cautious. There are some docs who will take you for ride at the cost of your health and will only prescribe medicine and not really heal you. Be careful in choosing your doctor. I am happy to recommend Dr Verma to others and while doing so I am going one step ahead by recommending  a great human being .  I wish others can experience your care and expertise as a doctor as I have . It\u2019s pleasure to know you doctor . ",

However, I was not satisfied, nor I was given proper medication. I was misguided by a doctor here who works in a top hospital (I do not wish to name) last year. The procedures done were just not satisfactory, and it landed up spoiling my health further.\n\nThen, one of my family member, referred Dr Mita (she is in Moolchand Hospital and has a clinic in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi). I met her and the way she explained things (considering first pregnancy), gave me medication, took extra care was incredible. She doesn't recommend extra or unnecessary tests, and always gives logic on what and why she is recommending any procedure or test. She is professional in her approach, yet personal if you are stressed (yes, this is common in pregnancy!). I have been visiting her for 1.5 years, and finally only because of her guidance and support, I\u2019m blessed with a baby boy. She isn\u2019t just a doctor for me, but a well-wisher. On my delivery, she was equally happy, like my family. I will recommend her to everyone who is planning their family, or even have issues related. *** ** *** *********** ***************",

She is always available no matter what time it is unlike other doctors who not even share the direct contact details and spend not more than 5 min with patients. She never push you to go for unnecessary tests and will prescribe the required ones only. I am seeing her from many years now and strongly recommend her, specially for complex cases as she is experienced and have extremely good knowledge. I am blessed and happy that i have been treated by Dr Mita. \nThanks and god bless you maam.",
