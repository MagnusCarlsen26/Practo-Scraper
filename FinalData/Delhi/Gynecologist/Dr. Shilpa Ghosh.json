She handles the usual checkups so perfectly and makes you feel absolutely comfortable. I can't forget when she almost reached dwarka after checking on me.. suddenly my vitals went bad..which was serious for the baby..on a call by the staff..she drove back to fortis to be there in 20 minutes for my delivery which couldn't be delayed.  I was terribly scared.. shivering.. but then I saw her and she held my hand saying don't worry the baby will be fine..I had tears but a trust that she is there kept me stable.. recommend her to all.. go ahead without any doubts. You are in the safest hands.",

I was terribly scared.. shivering.. but then I saw her and she held my hand saying don't worry the baby will be fine..I had tears but a trust that she is there kept me stable.. recommend her to all.. go ahead without any doubts.

It was really disappointing to see an unprofessional approach in todays modern world. The doctor didn't even bother to inform regarding unavailability for an scheduled appointment.",

As a doctor, this is the responsibility to explain things in detail and ask questions and do the check up if patient is sharing the problem but nothing happened. My experience was bad. I would not recommend anyone to consult her if you are new or trying the gyne.. I was searching a good gyne to consult things and understand my pregnancy but she was not helpful for me. she advised all the tests to be done but there were times when me and my husband could not understand what was she saying. Good that we understood at the first visit. Atleast we can search a good doctor.",
