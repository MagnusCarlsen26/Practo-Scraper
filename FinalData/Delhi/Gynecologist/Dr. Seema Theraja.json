On my 35th week She said \u201caap kabhi bhi aake admit ho jao\u201d i asked why. I can wait till 39th week atleast and why csection? She said \u201caajkal kon karwata hai normal\u201d these were her wordings. I was literally shocked. I tried to switch my doc but it was not in the rule book of hospital to do such thing. Now its my 37thweek going on. She said ki aap next week karwa lo delivery kabhi bhi. Then i discussed the date with my family and messaged her that is this date fine mam?, i need to get my covid test done please reply... is this ok mam?  Can i call you mam?  And she is not replying to my messages.

                "review_text": "I went to this doctor on my 5th month of pregnancy because my earlier doc was transferred. So, i told her all my concerns and she was not bothered at all and she just told baby is fine you can come next month. Then i told her i am gaining so much of weight please suggest me what should i do and She didn\u2019t answer my question too.. i had no other option but to continue with her. everytime i went to her and told her concerns, she never answered. On my 35th week She said \u201caap kabhi bhi aake admit ho jao\u201d i asked why. I can wait till 39th week atleast and why csection? She said \u201caajkal kon karwata hai normal\u201d these were her wordings. I was literally shocked. I tried to switch my doc but it was not in the rule book of hospital to do such thing. Now its my 37thweek going on. She said ki aap next week karwa lo delivery kabhi bhi. Then i discussed the date with my family and messaged her that is this date fine mam?, i need to get my covid test done please reply... is this ok mam?  Can i call you mam?  And she is not replying to my messages. I called her twice at different times..that too she is not bothered for their patients. * **** **** *** **** ** ** **** *** *** ****** **** **** *** **** ******* ** *** ***** ** *** **** ** ** *** ****** ******** *** *** **** ** **** ******** ****** ***** ** ** ***** *** ***** *******",
