,,0,0,YES,"Dr Anju Bala is a very fantastic and professional doctor. We recently had our first child and she was always there, whether on call or personally. She took care of me in every manner, we also had some complications during pregnancy and she showed the positiveness and supported us in all manner and helped us in getting out of that complications, not just that, I delivered the baby via normal delivery.
