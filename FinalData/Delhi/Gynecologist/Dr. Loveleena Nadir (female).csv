"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"“There’s nothing more important than our good health -That’s our principal capital asset”.

With this thought in our mind, we started our search for a good healthcare provider for our pregnancy journey. Pregnancy is a journey full of excitement yet challenging for every woman and finding the right gynaecologist makes the journey smoother.
While the transition to parenthood comes with new challenges, it has been a DELIGHTFUL experience to be treated by  Dr.Loveleena Nadir at Fortis La Femme.  My experience from the start has been in one word ‘AWESOME’.
From our very first visit to Dr. Nadir at the hospital, we were welcomed with a broad smile, positive energy and loads of enthusiasm. Her distinguished aura was extremely soothing and maternal as we were made to feel very comfortable while she took the time to explain everything well and answered all our queries patiently. She gave us a lot of her valuable inputs on what was lying ahead of us and explained major milestones during our journey which instilled the faith in us putting all our fears to rest. We came out of her chamber feeling extremely happy, confident and sure that the quest for our best healthcare provider ends with her. 

Dr. Loveleena Nadir is a miracle in the field of medicine with an extensive experience and unparalleled commitment which is definitely unmatched. She is the perfect blend of a highly competent medical professional and a compassionate human being. She is an extremely confident, proficient and highly qualified gynaecologist & obstetrician, who was always very approachable and meticulously gave us very actionable advice through each step. Her practical, flexible and reasonable approach gave us the reassurance that everything was going well during our journey. I had an exhilarating and a very soul satisfying birth experience as I delivered my healthy daughter this February under the leadership and guidance of Dr. Loveleena. She prioritised the baby's health and growth and ensured that both the baby and myself were doing well before and after the pregnancy.

""Not all angels have wings some have stethoscopes”, hence proved as Dr. Loveleena was truly an angel in disguise for us. As we hold our little girl in our arms, we feel immensely grateful and deeply thankful to Dr. Loveleena for making our journey a memorable one and shall strongly recommend her to all would- be -mothers for a happy and peaceful pregnancy journey and can assure that you would be in loving and capable hands!

Dr. Nadir has been my doctor since I was 15, so naturally I consulted with her even though I currently live in Hong Kong. On her advice, I got the tests – MRI and PET Scan done to verify whether the fibroid was malignant. While I was worried about the possibility of cancer, I was constantly in touch with Dr. Nadir and followed her advice to get the marker blood test done. After the PET scan and blood test marker were clear, I decided to get the fibroid removed (myomectomy) with Dr. Nadir. No other doctor in Hong Kong was willing to do the myomectomy laparoscopically because of the huge size of the fibroid. 
So, I flew to India to get my surgery done under the very experienced hands of Dr. Nadir. The best part of going through her is that she makes you feel comfortable, explains what’s going on scientifically, is trustworthy and takes care of every small detail so you have a worry-free surgery. 
I am so grateful to Dr. Loveleena Nadir for the personal care and excellent treatment during my laparoscopic myomectomy surgery.

Mine was a high risk pregnancy with multiple fibroids and one even partially obstructing for a C-section.

However, Dr. Loveleena had full patience and guided me throughout the process starting 3 weeks before the date of delivery. The timing of her decision to induce the pain was excellent and well thought out. 

Despite my fragile situation, she ensured that I had a perfectly normal delivery and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. I also did not need any blood transfusion and the fibroids were also excellently managed during delivery. 

There are doctors who treat you and you become well and then there are doctors whom you meet and you become well because of their personality. Dr. Loveleena is the latter and her personality is such that anyone would feel a burst of positive energy when one meets her. 

Had it not been for her expertise, I would have been totally stressed out. I cannot thank her enough and cannot recommend her enough to everyone!!
