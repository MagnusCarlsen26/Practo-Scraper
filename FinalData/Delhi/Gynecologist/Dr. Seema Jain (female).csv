None,None,0,0,YES,"My wife's blood group is B-Ve and I am B +Ve. My wife had a miscarriage at the early pregnancy. And Anti-D injection was administrated after 6 days which should  had been done within 72 hours of abortion. That was the big mistake of our life. Which caused a big problem in next pregnancy. After 6 months, we planned and visited gynecologist. She advised us to go for ICT test, which came out positive. Which means that its impossible to sustain pregnancy. It will again abort the pregnancy. We consulted with some other doctors also. They said that we had never seen this report as positive in our life. Everyone said that it might be difficult to conceive. Pray to God. Then someone suggested us to visit Dr. Seema Jain.
Me and My Wife visited Dr. Seema Jain and produced all the reports to her. She took it in very cool manner. And said us that its not a problem at all. You don't worry. At that day, we found a new ray of hope after losing hopes. She treated and always cleared all of our doubts. She used to talk like a family member. She is very nice doctor and lady as well.
We blessed with a baby girl on 03rd August 2020. And this is possible only due to Dr. Seema Jain. My words are less to thank her. Thank you very much mam.
