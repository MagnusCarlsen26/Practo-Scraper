Dr. Trehan is confident and highly skilled, and she saved my kidney, essentially saving my life. She dedicated ample time to explain every detail and potential consequence of the surgery, both pre and post-operation, which provided me with great comfort and reassurance.\n\nThe staff at Sunrise Hospital were generous and courteous, making my experience as smooth as possible. Their professionalism and kindness were evident throughout my entire stay.\n\nWhile the charges were higher than anticipated, the quality of care was undoubtedly worth it. Dr. Trehan\u2019s focused and meticulous approach made all the difference. I highly recommend Dr. Nikita Trehan and Sunrise Hospital for anyone seeking top-notch medical care",
