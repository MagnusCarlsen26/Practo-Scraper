Dr. Nivedita advised laparoscopic surgery to remove the left ovary. She explained everything about the surgery, both pre and post-procedure, with great clarity and positivity. The surgery was successful, and we only had to spend one night in the hospital. Dr. Nivedita patiently answered all our questions, whether during visits or even over calls and WhatsApp.\n\nDr. Nivedita is incredibly thorough and has a wonderfully positive approach. We really appreciate Dr. Nivedita's passion and commitment towards her patients. She is truly a doctor every patient deserves. \n\nThank you, Dr. Nivedita, for your help. We highly recommend Dr. Nivedita Kaul.",

Given our family's history of cancer, we were extremely worried. However, from our very first visit, Dr. Nivedita put us at ease. *** *********** *** *** ********* ***** *** ********* *** ***** ** ***** ********\nAfter the tests, we discovered that the tumor in my mother's ovary was small but potentially malignant. Dr. Nivedita advised laparoscopic surgery to remove the left ovary. She explained everything about the surgery, both pre and post-procedure, with great clarity and positivity. The surgery was successful, and we only had to spend one night in the hospital. Dr. Nivedita patiently answered all our questions, whether during visits or even over calls and WhatsApp.\n\nDr. Nivedita is incredibly thorough and has a wonderfully positive approach. We really appreciate Dr. Nivedita's passion and commitment towards her patients. She is truly a doctor every patient deserves. \n\nThank you, Dr. Nivedita, for your help. We highly recommend Dr. Nivedita Kaul.",

                "review_text": "Caution: Long post ahead, might take few minutes of your time ;)\n\nThey say, God cannot be everywhere, so He sent the doctors with excellence and selflessness. \n\nThe aforesaid unequivocally holds true in case of Dr.Nivedita Kaul.\n\nI have known Dr. Kaul for almost 9 years now, at the time when she was at the beginning of her career and was assisting one senior doctor. At that time, I used to visit the senior doctor for my routine check-ups and Dr. Kaul would be the one who would initially take patient briefings. Even then, I was so fascinated with her pleasing personality and the way she would interact with her patients. \n\nLittle did I know that one day, she\u2019d be the one who would bring our little bundle of joy into this world, hence, filling our lives with happiness in abundance. \n\nIf you are trying to conceive or are expecting, you want a doctor who you can trust and with whom conversations come naturally. With whom you can be yourself and talk your heart out. You\u2019re looking for a confidante you can feel comfortable with, who\u2019ll be there through important and personal aspects of your life. You should be able to talk openly and honestly about your worries and plans, and leave feeling understood, confident about your next steps together. You want someone who can paint the entire big picture before you and tell you what exactly you are going through. Someone who is just a call away. \n\nKeeping all this in mind, Dr. Nivedita\u2019s name is the first name that would come to my mind. So, I always wanted to consult her for my pregnancy but due to long distance, we were a bit skeptical. \n\nSo, we initially started consulting a gynae in our vicinity. But I was never fully satisfied. I would always tell my husband that I don\u2019t feel connected to our gynae and I don\u2019t feel happy after each of our visit. But since there were no complications as such, we continued. \n\nHowever, during fifth month of my pregnancy (in Feb 2021), I started facing low liquor issues which also started affecting growth of our baby. So, we decided to take second consultation from Dr. Nivedita. We visited her clinic and she explained to us in great detail all our tests and reports.  She told us that there was nothing to worry about and further asked us to keep her in loop going forward. \n\nThereafter, due to emergence of second wave of covid, I had to resort to tele and video consultation. I kept Dr. Nivedita abreast with all my tests and reports that were being advised by my other doctor. She would allay all our doubts and fears that would come up each time I had a scan. \n\nThen, towards the end of May, when I had my Growth and Doppler scan, we were appalled to see that the growth lag had risen to 2.5 weeks which was suggestive of mild asymmetric IUGR and the liquor had further reduced drastically (AFI ~ 8). Moreso, my own body weight  had started reducing. Liquor did not increase despite treatment prescribed by my other gynae. Infact, she had indicated that we might have to deliver the baby in first week of June (Due date: 8.7.21) through caesarean. \n\nWe instantly decided to switch to Dr. Nivedita. \nDr. Kaul calmed us down and explained to us all the options that were available to us. She prescribed daily IV drips and NST monitoring for a week and then for another week on alternate days. She also asked to increase the protein intake (she said jitna thoos sakte ho, thoos lo, jaan laga do poori :)).\n\nIn the next scan, we were happily surprised to see that my liquor had increased and the baby\u2019s weight had also increased to an ok level. \n\nWith her **** ******* ********* *** sensibility and taking full responsibility of the risk involved, she pulled through 20 days, which were sufficient to take me upto 36 weeks and 5 days (to avoid keeping the baby in nursery). \n\nShe called me for physical examination and told us that she had stretched for long enough and that now she would like to bring out the baby. She also told that we could try for normal birth first. \n\nAnd yes, finally, we did have a normal birthing experience. I delivered a beautiful baby girl on 21st June, 2021.  I had two wishes - first, to have a healthy baby through normal birth and second to have my husband by my side during the delivery process. I don\u2019t think this would have been possible if it weren\u2019t for Dr. Nivedita. \n\nThe best thing about Dr. Nivedita is that she has such a positive aura and positive approach that even when you are facing certain complications in your pregnancy, you will feel that everything will sort out on it\u2019s own. She has the capability to change the negative situations into positive one ! Also, she has some kind of photographic memory. I don\u2019t know how she manages it, but she mostly remembers details of all her patients. She always answers your calls and replies to your messages. She prescribed only limited and relevant scans, tests and medicines. She is very polite, down to earth and friendly. \n\nDr. Nivedita, my husband and I would like to\nthank you for everything that you\u2019ve done, for all your support during some really tough times. I mean, \u201cThank you\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to cover how we feel. We are thankful beyond words can express. Tears of joy roll down my eyes everytime I think of my entire journey with you. You are an amazing doctor and above all, a beautiful person inside out. *** *** ****** **** ****** \n\nWhenever we felt anxious or afraid of all the unknowns, all we had to do was talk to you and we knew in our heart that it would all work out. Your ever present compassion, attention to detail, always being available, support and care, amongst several other things provided me and my husband such comfort during the entire pregnancy. You are extremely gifted and talented. You are truly God sent ! \n\nWe may have paid for your fees, but for your kindness we shall forever remain indebted. \n\nI would like to tell everyone that before you choose your gynae, trust your instinct. My instinct guided me towards Dr. Nivedita. \n\nI would recommend her strongly for all your gynaecological concerns.",

Thought its again a false alarm as I had the similar contraction day before and went for a check at CK birla hospital in night , everything was normal and uterus was relaxed as per the Dr. On duty, so thought I cant make a progress over night for delivering a child,  these contractions will pass in an hour or two as yesterday, although waited patiently. As contraction started shortening and its was a odd time to contact Dr. Still I tried her number and could belive she was able to take calls at this hour , she told me not to panic, reach hospital and she will be there. \nBy the time I reached hospital contractions were every 8 to 10mins. They rushed me to labour room and before I could understand anything I was asked to push and special thanks to Dr. Nevidita not only she reached at the hospital as and when called she was a great support thought out my pregnancy and she helped me deliver the child in just 3 push and made this day memorable for lifetime.***** ** *** ** *** **** ** *** **** *** she is clam and composed in high pressure situations , so glad that I came across her and she made it so perfect..\nThank you Dr Nivedita Kaul.",

She explains treatment options in much detail so that patients can make informed decision. \n\nMy first pregnancy seven years earlier was a very difficult one. This time around I was very sceptical as I had other health issues as well but Dr. Nivedita, through her continuous monitoring took extra care that all goes well. \nI delivered healthy baby nicely and my pregnancy remained uneventful. I give entire credit to my doctor for that. She always answered my calls amd replied to my messages. I really appreciate that she remembered my details whenever I phoned her, shows her dedication towards her profession. \nI am thankful to Almighty for connecting me with her. I recommend her strongly for gynaecological problems. \n",

From the day one she took such a good care of us that I never felt doubt about anything even for a sigle moment. Her approach was a perfect balance of modern and traditional treatment. She recommended least possible medicines and focused more on my diet for pre natal vitamins. \n\nOn the day my son was born i came to fortis for a perfectly normal delivery but suddenly my son struck his umbilical cord in his neck and i was rushed to an emergency c section coz his heart rate went very low. The only thing I remember from OT is that i was lying there in terrible pain and anaesthesiologist was asking Dr. Nivedita, \u2018Shall i give her injection\u2019. And she replied \u2018i want to try one more time (for a normal delivery).\u2019 She tried till the very last moment. And we highly respect her for that. \n\nI will recommend her to everyone.

There were times when we called her during odd hours or to schedule a appointment during a particular time and she accomodated us every time.\nShe even called us back during the time of pregnancy to check on my health status and guide us on the hospitalisation formalities..process and procedures.\nHer command over pregnancy matters is absolutely fantastic and we have already recommended her to our relatives and friends.\nWe can vouch for her anytime..pls feel free to ask any questions related to Dr. Nivedita.",

But, what really makes her stand out is how she made me feel like I was his only patient and that she would spend as much time with me as I needed. She was incredibly thorough in not only asking me about my history, but in explaining all my options. She emphasized that I should feel free to contact her any time with any questions. I think the highest compliment one can give to a doctor is that they treat a patient like a member of their family and Dr Nivedita did that for me. I feel so lucky to have found her.

I can say that myth is true that doctors are the another god as the way she treats and available at very odd hours for helping the patient is something which cannot be avoided. As this is was my second pregnancy and i was very scared but she calmed me down and in each and every visit she ensured me that she is there to handle everything. This actually happened my delivery was very comfortable and she made me relaxed at every point of time. She is the person whom we can trust blindly. Even after my delivery i will be consulting her only for any other female problems if any. Thanks to Dr. Nivedita for everything and blessed to have such doctors around us.

Doctor Nivedita guided us through every details like consulting with a geneticist and other pre pregnancy steps.

And i think that is what we all need during these times, somebody who listens to you patiently and provides you a solution. After my surgery, I have had no problems (severe dysmennorhea) that I was facing during my teenage years and after marriage too. I have recommended her to all my female relatives who face gynaecological issues and she will be my go-to person for all such issues in the near future, if any. Thankyou doctor for all your help.",

I went with my husband for mu ANC check up for the first time & was highly gratified to have met dr nivedita mam given the way she counselled and clinically attended me and my husband. As it was my first pregnancy I was very apprehensive reg. Many things but the doctor counselled and explained everything very immaculately for over 25 min.  \nHer serene personality with unerring approach and the habit of indulgence with the patient like a mother is something which separates her from other doctros..I was so comfortable after her first consultation that I said to my husband: \" I can go for the delivery inside the delivery room without my mother besides me since the doctor is motherly in her approach. \nTHANKS DR NIVEDITA KAUL MAM FOR YOUR CARE & TREATMENT.",

I found Dr. Nivedita just by luck while searching on this app. We were trying to conceive and hence it was important to have a good gyenac around. My overall experience with Dr. Nivedita has been incredible. She is a wonderful person by heart, a great human being and an awesome doctor. My journey with her has been great, she has always gone extra miles to help. I am a mother of 4 months baby girl now, my pregnancy was smooth but post delivery I had some lactation issues and thereafter underwent another surgery. Though it was not her area of specialisation but each time Dr Nivedita's  suggestions were life saver for me, she is truly an angel. Lots of love and hug to you doctor for helping us bring this little girl in our life, the journey couldn't have been better without you. Wish you great success ! ",

Her process of explanation of the problem and then suggesting the solution based on facts  truly speaks of her approach towards solving the patient's problem. Once we met her and we knew we have reached the  right place and are in safe hands. The most important aspect the the total treatment is that we never felt disconnected after the first meeting. The prompt response on Phone/WhatsApp gave us the feeling that the doctor is mentally attached even after we have left the Clinic which gave us the sense of security . So we feel once you meet her and then leave the rest to her. She will treat you like your own family member.",

Firstly , I was really worried about the process but she recommended me everything. Also , kept a touch of my personal life so that I feel more comfortable. I\u2019ve always had a good experience with her and I see forward to meeting her for my future deliveries. Would love to give her the opportunity of the same. Thank you so much doctor for making me so comfortable and being in touch with me throughout. \nThe way she follows up with you , I\u2019ve never seen any doctor doing this before and that\u2019s one of the best quality of Dr. Nivedita. I had any problem , I directly messaged her or called her and all my queries was sorted in seconds. \nThank you once again doctor. \n",

Can\u2019t forget that day when I and my husband came to her with so many doubts. It is rightly said that GOD cannot be everywhere he made sure we have doctors like her who have the gift of healing mankind.\nThe best part is that she takes more time to listen to her patients and available to her patients round the clock and gives them individual attention throughout the time. This exceptional feature is hardly seen in any other doctor these days. She is thorough, Intelligent and fully professional in her domain.\nIt wasn\u2019t the medicine; it was her reassuring words which gave me the strength to pull through my hard time. As a doctor, she has gone above and beyond everything, I ever could have expected.\nMy testimonial for Dr. Nivedita is less of recognition of the professional expertise and more of a recommendation of her ability to listen, care and heal. I highly recommend her worth for being in most capable and safe hands.\nBefore saying that she is an extraordinary doctor; I would like to mention that she is an extra ordinary HUMAN BEING.\n",

Her personal attention and probelm solving skills are those to look out for.  And being a doctor myself, I could see and trust her apt and timely clinical judgement.. my delivery date was during the second covid wave.. which in itself was a big stressor. But ma'am's patience and support made that horrifying time much more comfortable than it would have been.

She used to explain each and everything in such detail, that we actually felt she is like one of us (unlike other Doctors who do not have time to hear our concerns). She had been really patient throughout, handling my anxiety with so much ease. And the best part about her is when she calls you to ask if all is well after you texted her that something is not well. You feel like a priority. I can not thank her enough for how wonderful a guide, friend, family she has been for us. Baby Hinaya is really lucky that she got Dr. Nivedita as her First Doctor!

She goes extra miles to make every effort possible in patients well-being and she treated me with lot of patience throughout the process and guided me professionally and personally like a family member. She looked after each and every details of my case from assessing the report to making further arrangements at the hospital and that gave me strength and positivity to deal with very unfortunate circumstances.

Doctor listened to us calmly; did few physical check-ups and advised some pathological and radiological tests to be done. She explained us about the probable disease and informed us of pertinent treatment. The way she assured us that there is no need to worry, at all, made most of our stress vanish immediately at that moment. We got the tests done and on the basis of results, my fiancee was advised medication and few lifestyle changes in order to win over the disease. Treatment is going on, as of now, and results too are visible now after a month. We are happy with doctor. A GREAT DOCTOR, indeed. Thank You so much ma'am for helping us. We will always be obliged to you. GOOD WISHES FOR YOU :)",
