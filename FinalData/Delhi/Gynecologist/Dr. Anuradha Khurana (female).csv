(Note: My review is highly subjective. Whats good for me might not be the same for you)

Firstly, considering she is giving her services at an affordable rate of just 500‚Çπ  per visit, I believe such a criticism should not be taken seriously. Moreover, my opinion is biased, surely, as I am comparing it with the other doctors I have consulted. 

Yet, review is a review. Scope of improvement is always there.

I believe her ""energetic"" manner is a bit more than required, as she needs to explain more, and respond less non-verbally. Her responses were close ended; nothing wrong, but as a clueless patient, she should be doing the talking, rather than waiting for me to ask questions. 

Meeting ended up being too brief, and about ""giving the talk and the medicines"". She did try to make the patient understand the state of affairs, and the course of whats ahead, but the manner was a bit hasty and transactional.
