"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy care and management,Pregnancy Check Up,Reccurent Pregnancy Loss,",0,0,YES,"A Guiding Light on Our Journey to Parenthood.

We had an exceptional experience with Dr. Shikha Gurnani, our beautiful gynecologist. She is not just an excellent doctor but also a kind and compassionate HUMAN BEING. From the very beginning, Dr. Gurnani was a guiding light. She meticulously conducted all the necessary tests and explained everything in detail about the changes I could expect. Her approachable and friendly demeanor, coupled with her selfless service and social work, truly set her apart. I always felt comfortable and well-cared for during my visits. 

Dr. Shikha Gurnani is very polite, genuine, yet very professional. She explains every aspect of the current diagnosis in detail, whether it's positive or negative. Her treatment is effective, and she ensures that her patients receive the best care possible.

We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Shikha to every expecting parent. Her patience, empathy, and professionalism make every visit comfortable and reassuring. She takes the time to listen to concerns and provides clear instructions for a healthy pregnancy. We are incredibly grateful for her unwavering support and dedication.

She gave us a space where we have joked and laughed about anything we felt about with her. 

With a vast experience many doctors lose the human touch in their treatment and that was our biggest concern. And we can say this from bottom of our heart that it's not the case with Dr Shikha. She'll make you feel that it's her responsibility to take good care of your baby and you. 

Thank you, Dr. Shikha Gurnani, for making our dream of parenthood come true. Our beautiful daughter Twisha is a testament to your expertise and compassion. ",2024-07-21 09:38:16,False,True,Navneet Singh ,,,

Her expertise is truly commendable, providing comprehensive care with a reassuring demeanor. Her attentive approach and clear communication made me feel comfortable discussing sensitive health matters. Dr. Shikha addressed all my concerns with professionalism and compassion, ensuring I felt heard and understood. 

Since this was our first child, we were unaware of what we were getting into. Dr. Shikha constantly reassured us and kept us informed of what was happening both to my body and emotions. Every step of the way, we knew we were in good hands.

She made herself very approachable and available to me. Her passionate way of interacting with her patients made us become very faithful in her approach. She is compassionate, thoughtful, dedicated to providing the best patient care. The months leading up to the big day were full of questions and concerns, but we were handled so well by her and answered all our queries with a smile. Her calm demeanor and positive aura helped create a tranquil environment during this once in a lifetime event.

I will always be grateful for the excellent care provided by Dr. Shikha and her entire team at Bloom Vision.

From a stress-free delivery to a perfect, quick healing circumcision, the C-section was a great stress free experience.

Thank you Ma‚Äôam for making this experience a wonderful one! :) We highly recommend Dr. Shikha for her outstanding expertise and patient-centered care. A definite five-star experience. üëç

As of today, I dont mind saying that Dr. Gurnani was not only my wife's doctor for pregnancy but was like a mother and guardian angel who delivered an angel to us after three years of her medical efforts and my wife's two miscarriages.  
Would like to give you a crisp background to substantiate the headline.

First Year_Dec 2016
I went to the doctor in 2016 Dec for my wife's first pregnancy after reading reviews on practo. I can tell you that I didn't feel its my first visit, the staff was very courteous but i was concerned about the doctor considering my past experiences with other doctors who were rude and arrogant.  But doctor removed all my preconceived notions and welcomed us as she knew us before. 
Doctor started the treatment but unfortunately our baby couldn't survive more that 1.5 months and my wife went under D&C. I thought that Doctor like others will not be bothered about our loss but she tried to console us like a mother.

Second Year_Dec 2018

After the first miscarriage, we planned again in 2018 and visited the doctor. I was surprised to see that not only the staff but doctor knew our names even after 2 years. Doctor was happier than us to see us once again and she started the treatment once again but unfortunately our baby didint survive again after 1.5 months from the conception.  Doctor was also surprised with that but you cannot change whats written in your destiny.  Even in that situation i didnt lose my trust on doctor and left everything to her for further treatment whereas if it could have been other patient then they could have blamed the doctor.

Third Year_July 2019

After the completion of healing period we visited the ""same"" doctor once again in July 2019 for the treatment. I still remember the conversation, Doctor said ""I will not leave any stone unturned and will apply whatever i have learned to make you proud parents but you need to trust me"" and I replied "" I wont be standing here with my wife once again, I have immense trust in you"". Doctor advised us some tests & medicines and started the treatment. During the course of the treatment, Doctor used to advise and guide us like a mother not as a doctor. She was available for us all the time (but we didnt took advantage of that and didnt disturb her in nights and weekends unless its urgent and critical). Even this pregnancy was not a cake walk for us but doctor held our hands and walked with us throughout the pregnancy. There were high chances of caesarean but doctor was pushing for normal delivery and i was astonished when my wife delivered the baby girl in the night of 31st March through normal delivery. 

I cannot pay back ever to the doctor what she has done for us, Doctor came like a guardian angel in our life who filled our life with everlasting happiness. I can keep on writing but it will not be enough.",2020-04-13 16:11:06,False,True,Aakash Jain,thanks for the lovely words of appreciation,2020-05-11T14:28:38+0000,Dr. Shikha Gurnani
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"When u hold ur tiny angel in your hands for the first time - you become a parent. That‚Äôs what often people say, but they are wrong. 
The day one gets to know that they have conceived is when the journey of parenthood begins.
We were early birds üòÅ... figured it out in the 3rd week that we had conceived. Being proactive I had shortlisted a few and finalized onto one particular doctor basis on the reviews, rating, experience from Practo before hand.  So we rushed with the pregnancy kit test to her. 
A calm and composed, yet chirpy doctor on the other side... she had her mask on, but from her eyes I could read that she had a wide smile. She said that it looks that you have passed but let‚Äôs run some tests and be sure. That‚Äôs my baby‚Äôs first date with doctor Gurnani. 
In those 9 months I went through a lot - not being able to gain weight initially, a bit of complications in the ultra sound, a small car accident and got infected with Coronavirus ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Being from hospitality I was working 14 hours - traveling 60kms - and constantly on my feet - parents in a different city. The reason I am sharing all this is because I want you to understand what kind of support I got from her. 
There are times I would msg her with silly questions, would rush  into the clinic with serious issues and a lot more...but there was not a single time I gave a second thought about considering someone else. My husband would make fun of me, that I often found reasons to meet her as it was comforting. May be it was true.
I wanted a normal delivery. She had recommended to stay active without stressing and I chose to work till the last month and one day I was at work and wasn‚Äôt sure if I was in labor so I messaged her and rushed once she confirmed.
A samosa, a plate of chowmein and a few hours later - I had my angel in my arms.
Normal delivery - few extra stitches (as my body wasn‚Äôt ready cos it was bit ahead of EDD) but no one else could have made that moment so beautiful for me. As she was stitching me up and scolding me like a momma ... I laughed and said - u can‚Äôt get irritated - m gonna come back in a  few years for the next one. 
For me to say that on the table, at that point - you can understand what kind of trust she must have instilled in me. 
My husband and I are both chefs and in our words - like a perfect chef, she got the bun out of the oven, just right in time
Not to forget, there is pinky at the reception - she is a saviour when you need last minute help with getting an appointment on a busy day.
Loads of love

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"A truly amazing doctor hard to find and impossible to forget. this saying goes with Dr Shikha Gurnani perfectly. We came to know about Dr. Shikha Gurnani through one of our friend. Then we search out on practo. After reading so many positive reviews we decided to approach shikha mam for our first pregnancy in 2018. After meeting her we found her very straight forward and strict. She explained everything in detail and answered all my questions and cleared my all doubts. My pregnancy was natural and healthy. All my reports were normal.  But at 33 week I lost my child due to chord around her neck in the stomach only. I was devastated and broken. Because she approached for a normal delivery we waited for  3 days but due to hard luck we moved to c-sec. I thought I would never going to have a child. There must be some medical problem with me. But at that point of time Shikha mam supported me a lot. She promised me that you are going to have your baby in one year. I still remembered her words "" tera baccha toh me hi karungi,"" and dont know how .... i got a ray of hope. She advised me to take one year gap due to c sec. But actual struggle started now. Suddenly I started to gain weight. After 5 months of operation I visited her clinic again and she advised me to take some tests. Then we found some medical problem with me. And now before thinking about pregnancy we need to settle down my medical condition. I followed her instructions and contact to the  specialist suggested by her only. And guess what in only 2 months my health was  in control. Then after waiting for 2 more months we decided to conceive again. In January 2020 I conceived again by the grace of God. And decided to consult her only. In my 2nd pregnancy she took all the precautions she can. Due to my first pregnancy experience & this pandemic of corona,I was also very much scared. She guided me whenever I had any doubt or problem even on phone / WhatsApp.  She has lovely combination of professionalism and care. She never gave up on me, even when I had doubt about my pregnancy. One of the best doctor and person we have ever met. Her positive approach & beautiful smile made everything easy. She kept her promise  Due to her continuous efforts and by the Grace of god we are blessed with  a healthy baby boy. I would highly recommend Dr Shikha for those who are waiting for their bundle of joy.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"First apologies for posting this too late, But I feel Dr. Shikha Gurnani deserves to be reviewed as the dedication & oneness she gives to her patients is really commendable. 
This is after 11 years of our marriage we took decision to have second baby as we were already blessed with 10 year old son. We approached a female gynecologist (don't want to mention her name) with which we had a very negative and bad experience of life. Due to non-co-operation& handling the case lightly my wife went thru a great trauma.
 Again after a year we decided to take another chance for second baby, then we decided to search on practo for the same and find a suitable doctor for my wife treatment and course. We searched for good gynecologist in Dwarka. Dr. Shikha has 97% recommendations & positive reviews and we were surprised to see such a high positive feedback. We also saw 100% reviews for other doctors but the no. of reviewers were too less as compared to Dr. Shikha. 
Just at our first appointment with her we were happy & satisfied that yes Dr. Shikha will be good mentor & friend for my wife who had already faced so much trauma a year back. She is such an amazing doctor & individual, she built confidence in our mind that my wife can deliver even at the age of 39 years.
She also guided us the genetic problems as this age a woman can have, so with her advice we went for genetic test and result was very satisfying. At first we were in great fear of this test but the way she guided was so awesome that all went well.  We were so comfortable while talking to her and she always explained everything in a positive manner. We also discussed a problem of my wife which she had after her first delivery 10 years ago, she took is so calmly and tell us don‚Äôt to worry as she will be operating that vein also which causes problem during her mensuration time. 
Finally the day came when i took my wife to  Venkateshwar hospital because she was feeling a severe pain and even at 7 AM in morning i called up doctor and asked for suggestion , she immediately told me don‚Äôt to worry and take her to hospital as she will be guiding the staff there for further check processes . We reached hospital around 8 AM & found that she already instructed the staff and doctor on duty. My wife was so much in pain but she told doctor to wait for our elder son to back from school as he wished to be present at the time of baby birth for which she handled the situation so beautifully and managed to agree her for immediate C-Section.
I can still remember that moment when Dr. Shikha came out from labor room and congratulates me for been blessed with a Baby Girl (that is what we wished for). I had tear in my eyes & It was like a dream come true after seeing my little baby girl. Our world is filled with joy forever. She also handled the post-delivery complication which my wife faced in last delivery. 
It would not have been possible without the Dr. Shikha's utmost dedication, due diligence and professional attitude in the complete process. Another praise-worthy initiative is that she requests every parent after the delivery to plant a tree in the name of the new born baby (which is still pending from my side). We are very grateful & thankful to Dr Shikha Gurnani for the wonderful journey.

She is no less than ‚ÄúA Living God‚Äù for us. I can‚Äôt explain more in words that how the hope and love Shikha Ma‚Äôam showered on us.Our journey with her started like this ‚Äì I was diagnosed and operated with myomectomy twice within a short span of 4 years. My second myomectomy was a nightmare though it was performed by a reputed doctor in a renowned hospital.¬†We thought of planning for our second baby after one year of my surgery. We visited a famous gynaecologist for pre-natal consultation. She straight away sent us for IVF. We somehow couldn‚Äôt make up our minds for IVF; hence we thought of going the natural way and visited Dr. Shikha as I have already heard so many positive responses about her.I would like to name it as miracle or destiny as in our 2nd¬†visit to Shikha ma‚Äôam, we were confirmed with positive result of pregnancy. She then consulted me with utmost empathy and prepared us mentally for the wonderful nine months journey of pregnancy.Each time we visited her, we used to come out of her clinic with happy faces and confidence in hearts **** ** *** ** *** ***** ****** **** ********** ********* ** ** ******** *** ****** **** we feel safe with her. She used to clarify all my serious / silly queries with patience. I always look forward to her routine check-ups as meeting her is such a pleasant experience altogether. She arranges pre-natal class which was very informative.I had issues with high BP throughout my pregnancy. Ma‚Äôam managed this serious condition so smoothly and without giving us any anxiety which she used to take on behalf of us without even showing it to us. She makes situations so normal with her humorous nature and at the same time keeps strict check on the patients whenever necessary, which is so amazing and unique quality of her.Finally, I had caesarean in first week of October, which was a high risk surgery, but I didn‚Äôt feel it even for a single moment, except for written in the medical reports. I was apprehensive this time because of my past experience with myomectomy surgery, but the surgery was so smooth and painless that I was on my feet walking comfortably from day 3rd¬†morning itself.Her always smiling face and excellent counseling qualities did wonders in our pregnancy and after delivery recovery as well.Here I would like to mention one more quality which is so unique about Shikha Ma‚Äôam. Her ‚Äúpersonal touch‚Äù with the patients does magic in the healing process. Our baby was admitted in the NICU for few days. She used to continuously take updates from the concerned pediatrician and share the same with us. Till the time baby came home, she was continuously in touch with the pediatrician as well as with us. I wonder if these level of ‚Äúpersonal connection‚Äù any other gynaecologist share with their patients.Another praise-worthy matter is that she requests every patient after the delivery to plant a tree in the name of the new born baby. This unique initiative has touched our hearts very much. In nutshell she is a gem of a person.Shikha ma‚Äôam, last but certainly not the least, we would like to ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù for all the guidance, counseling, support and everything you did for us and you are still these doing for us.¬†Because of Shikha ma‚Äôam, today we have the most precious gift, our baby, with us. She is not only a doctor; she is a friend, guide and mentor for life.We would like to recommend her to each and everyone who seeks gynaecology and obstetrician care.Thanks You ‚ÄúPracto‚Äù for giving us the opportunity to connect to such a lovely and amazing doctor and human being ‚Äì Dr. Shikha Gurnani.With lots of love and best wishesBandana and Prachurjya",2018-11-11 12:39:09,False,True,BANDANA KHOUND,Thank you dear Bandana..

We were going through Practo reviews and came to know about Dr. Shikha Gurnani. 

Her reviews on Practo were very positive which made us little skeptical about the genuineness of her reviews. Still we took the appointment and went to Genesis to meet her. We talked to many of her patients sitting outside in the waiting area about their overall experience with the doctor. They all were very happy and satisfied. We got little relief hearing the reviews directly from her patients rather relying only on Practo.

When we met her on our first appointment at Genesis, she was very polite, down to earth yet caring and experience. We always wanted to have Normal Delivery and she always supported and motivated us for the same. She guided us very well and my wife followed all her instructions to have normal delivery. She is always available  on call or what's app for help and support. Now we are proud parents as my wife delivered a baby boy via Normal Delivery at Venkateshwar Hospital, Dwarka.

Long Story Short -  It has been an amazing journey with Dr Shikha. She's a great doctor one can wish for.  She is personable, friendly, calm, and an absolute joy to talk to. she will make you feel like home and comfortable to tell your problems easily. She's a perfect combination of professional doctor and a good friend.

Going through childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness. In this journey, the presence of a wonderful doctor like you is simply priceless. Thanks doctor, for comforting my wife and taking away all her stress.

Unfortunately none of the other doctors were able to diagnose the root cause behind my issues.

I visited 2-3 doctors before Dr. Shikha but was not satisfied due to various reasons, like money minded, time constraint, deal with casually, and most of the times the doctors were in so much hurry that our queries remained unanswered.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"I got to know about Dr. Shikha through Practo in 2015, when I just got married. It was just been three days that me and husband before leaving for honeymoon wanted to know more about the family planning. She was amazed and complimented us for our pro approach. Since then I have been in touch with Dr. Shikha. On Aug 2017 I got to know that I was pregnant. My immediate attention was to approach Dr. Shikha. I was much relieved with her advise. She is friendly and professional. Even the doctor attendant was calm. Indeed there was rush of patients but she never loses her calm. Our faith grew more when my mother in law and mother went to meet her. Instantly their faith in her was quite appreciative.
The 09 months pregnancy was a interestingly bit inconvenient but joyful phase. Her medicines and health advise were appropriate. Though I was lean and unable to put on required weight. She motivated me enough through different means. Sometimes happily sometimes like a strict teacher :) Her only suggestion to me was to have a normal delivery for which I was so scared. Her confidence and ability to create a positive mind set let me to go for normal delivery. 
By the time I came to my 08 months she suggested me to do exercises. I was all time working professional. On generic regular follow check up day on 17th March, she did examine me and wished me good luck for a happy news. 
Voila !! I was in labour on the same evening and went to Hospital. By 10pm I was admitted and within an hour I was blessed with a baby girl. 
Dr. Shikha has been extremely honest, approachable and sincere in her profession. I am grateful that I could find her well in time. My family and me all are happy with her. For sure she needs to be recognised and referred to.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Shikha is an absolutely amazing doctor and nice cheerful human being. I consulted her to conceive. She told me the exact situation of my hormonal issues without giving any wrong expectations. Though I was aware of my pcod and bad hormonal levels already. So it was a major concern for me that how much time it will take to resolve my issue. I planned my pregnancy after 5 years of my marriage and have a fear in my mind somewhere that people comments should not be true that in starting you are not planning and later you will be too late to conceive. But as I was not ready mentally and physically so I took risk of planning late . But when I made a decision to conceive, it was really hard to wait and made me worried. As I have wasted 1 year on homeopathic treatment for pcod and it made my pcod more worse than any improvement. So I choose Dr. Shikha after reading positive reviews on practo... And I found her exactly lucky doctor for me. She helped me to conceive within 6 months. With my bad levels of hormones, 6 months is not long time as there were possibilities of more time. I was really worried whether I will conceive or not after listening my friends stories of pcod and there conceiving time. But I conceived in 1st month of trying after getting my hormones balanced under the proper guidance of Dr. Shikha for 6 months. I can proudly say that miracle happens when you and Dr. both have trust and patience üòä I had instances of pain in my lower abdomen and sebaceous cysts during my pregnancy.

Right from our very first visit back in 2017 and this year 2021, we were very happy to have chosen Shikha Mam for our care. The right amount of information at the right amount of time kept us at ease and relaxed, which was very important to us. No unwanted tests, no scares etc. Just the required tests and visits to make sure mom and baby were doing well. Very modern and up-to-date practices made the whole experience enjoyable. When it came to delivery of both my babies, the combined care of Shikha Mam and her staff at hospital made my delivery process smooth and that too a normal delivery even though I had some complications in my first delivery. We could not have asked for more. I would also like to mention again the excellent quality of caring nature of her staff and nurses. Overall, a great experience, we feel lucky to have her as our gynecologist because I don't think that you can find anyone better than her in Delhi or infact in entire India.

Her way of explaining everything and making sure that you understand her treatment is something you don't find in many doctors these days. And no matter how late it is or how many patient she have, she will always give proper time and listen to your every question and answer them. she didn't recommend any unnecessary tests and when I told her that I want a normal delivery she was more than supportive of that. Although she didn't make any promises and would tell me everything clearly. I was always looking forward to Meeting her, because she would put my mind to ease with her suggestions and treatment. I  normally delivered  a healthy baby girl on 20th December with her help in the morning all because as soon as she came to know I was in labor and in the hospital she came running, that's how much she is dedicated for her patients and would recommend everyone to consult her and you can blindly trust her.

Firstly she is all welcoming and so approachable to ask any questions and encourages both the partners to ask questions and answers in a way that can be understood and relate to the current stage and experience that your partner goes trough in all the three trimesters. Her ability to communicate well and explain difficult topics in a simple and understanding manner is highly commendable and as a male partner I did not have any hesitation to be approachable to her which helped me to support my partner in the best way possible. 

Secondly her clinic is very organised in terms of literature charts and other multiple things and she has ensured her support staff is well trained and explain things in a very easy manner which becomes very easy to handle.

Thirdly her friendliness and approachability will help you and your partner to ensure the entire journey of pregnancy remains memorable. At the end of the day what matters is how the journey of the 9 months are and the many good memories that are gathered during this time and she ensures it‚Äôs done in a very efficient manner.

We were blessed with a baby boy and all thankful to her to ensure our journey is a memorable and happy one. We will always remain thankful and blessed to find a doctor of such high caliber and knowledge to always remain indebted to her.

Thank you Dr Shikha for being such a nice human first and then the doctor.

We approached other famous doctor in dwarka. After first appointment with her we realized that We can not move forward with her as she was not approachable and extremely busy. 

We again starting searching for a good Gynecologist and our search landed at Dr Shikha Gurnani Clinic through Practo. Some time the reviews created doubt in mind how a doctor can have 97% positive feedbacks. But after meeting with her first time she built confidence in our mind that my wife can deliver normally even at the age of 37 years. 

In each pregenancy check-up she was becoming more of a friend than doctor. We were so comfortable while talking to her that we shared every single point with her which she explained in positive manner. We already told her that my wife had PPH in last delivery. Her best part was that she always encouraged my wife for NVD and warned her if my wife missed any instruction she gave in last visit. Some of the warnings are soft and some are very strict (like a good teacher). We were very happy to have a good Gynecologist but the best part of the doctor was yet to come.

In the last visit before pregnancy she wishes us luck for the delivery and next day my wife came into labour. We went to Venkateshwar hospital next day morning at 10 am after talking to her. She already talked to the on-duty doctor and instructed them before we reached there. Every thing was very slow before she entered into the hospital. She changed the picture just after entering the labour room. My wife was so much exhausted and told doctor for C-section. But it was the doctor who motivated my wife to put all the energy and not to loose confidence. She left no stone unturned to get the normal delivery and succeeded.

I can still remember her voice (PUSH PUSH.... :) ) which was coming out from Labour room. She also handled the post delivery complication which my wife faced in last delivery. It was like a dream come true after hearing first cry of the baby.

We are very grateful to Dr Shikha Gurnani for the wonderful journey. It wouldn't be easy without you and your support. Thanks for the motivation you gave throughout the journey. 

Thank you so much Doctor!!!!

I visited 2 doctors before Shikha but was not satisfied due to various reasons, like money minded doctors, Time constraint discussion, and most of the times the doctors were in so much hurry that our queries remained unanswered.  500 Rupees and 2 to 3 mins talk and that too with too much professionalism. 

The first visit to Dr. Shikha happened after reading some review over Practo.  The first visit gave us a positive vibes that we have reached the right place and with the time it turned to a relation.  She is too strong in her field.  I have been blessed with a Baby Girl and I thank her again and again for the normal delivery she supported my wife with.

There was one moment at the Labor hour that my wife with pain requested for a C-SEC, but Dr. Shikha with positive aggression made my wife confident and strong to get it to Normal Delivery. 

I still remember when Dr. Shikha entered the room and she got a call from a patient, she said to the caller ‚Äú I am doing a delivery and will be free in one hour‚Äù.  I looked at my wife and said ‚ÄúOne Hour, seriously‚Äù.  And what truth exactly after one hour I touched my daughters feet.

To Everyone ‚ÄúGo blindly to her, you will be in right hands‚Äù.  They say ‚ÄúDoctor is next to God‚Äù and Yes with Dr. Shikha me and my wife felt it.

Thank you Dr. Shikha for supporting this lifetime event.

Doctor was also concerned for the same & guided us so well regarding each & everything whether it is medicines, vaccinations, activities or diet..she was so caring.

She is very straightforward and explains everything to the point. I went into labor in 35 weeks. I was 3.5cm dilated with minimal pains. But suddenly the baby's heartbeat dropped to 50. I was being taken to OT for a CS because of severe fetal distress. I could feel the doctor herself was not happy for CS. When we reached OT, the baby's heartbeat was back to normal. She suggested we wait for another contraction in OT . Though the OT people were really ready to go for CS. She really tried and with her trials, within 2 hours I had normal delivery. I can say if there would have been any other doctor, we would not have  returned back from OT without a CS. Its because of her determination the normal delivery was possible.

Being diagnosed with Ectopic Pregnancy last year, i was scared and sceptical to plan our baby. We thoroughly checked Practo and visited Dr Shikha the very first time in Dec‚Äô17. She prescribed Vitamins and advised some tests and proved to be extremely Lucky for Us as we found out that i was expecting our baby in Jan‚Äô18 i.e. in the next appointment itself. 

We always looked forward to our appointments as her aura gave us so much positive vibes and While talking to her without being hesitant gave us confidence that we ( I and my unborn baby) were in safe and secured hands. She makes you feel extremely comfortable and at the same time being straightforward, she explains your current situation in an evident manner without even scaring you. 

On 13th Sep, we were blessed with a baby Boy and we cant Thank her enough for being our counsellor and a friend in this Beautiful and blissful journey.

Hello everyone, this is my first review post, so please ignore me getting emotional. As you all know giving birth to baby is no less than a Herculean task. Since this was my first pregnancy, me n my husband were kind of nervous as wanted to be sure about everything and also there were lots of questions in our mind. So we wanted a good doctor who take us though with all the new things happening around us and guide us to right things. So we searched on  google for some good odd days and landed to ‚Äúpracto‚Äù, while scanning through the site we found Mrs Shikha and then as usual we read all the reviews and ratings and decided to go to her, in fact one of the best thing was distance to her clinic, it was right next our society. Got her appointment for next day and We went to her clinic, by the first look we know that our baby will deliver in safe hands, she has some positive aura, always a smiling face and friendly behaviour. Oh I forgot to mention our first doctor who disclose that I am pregnant, that experience was quite disappointed, don‚Äôt know why but that doctor is not friendly, so we searched for better Doc and got the Best for us.

Yes she is a strict at time but loveable as well, she always encouraged us for normal delivery, during my pregnancy I was gaining weight like anything, so she gave me strict diet schedule and put me on physical exercise so that whatever I eat should burn. I did lot of walk n exercise, she examine me internally in 7th month and told me that my body is very much made for normal delivery, so keep doing your physical activity. 
My due date was approaching, n my baby hasn‚Äôt dropped yet, It started to make us little worried cause if my pains or water break doesn‚Äôt happen then we would have to undergo for c-section, being baby was gaining weight and that would make complicate things further. She positively told us on 10th of feb and wished us all the very best for coming week, and yes on 12th feb my water broke, she asked me to go to hospital with in an hour time, with my husband we rushed to hospital immediately.
Next evening we had our bundle of joy, All the credit goes to our Dr. Shikha n her team in hospital they are very cooperative. They made my delivery very easy.
Huge thanks to doctor Shikha and her team. 

From me and my husband side this is the right choice, and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOCTOR

None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Shikha......... THE GOD
I was seeing some other gynaecologist before Dr. Shikha and was worried with complications explained to me by one of the so called ""renowned gynaecologist of dwarka"". We met Dr Shikha just to take a second opinion and was very sure we will stick to that famous doctor only. 
We had a high risk pregnancy and in the very first trimester of pregnancy that doctor said she will do a C section.

We shared all the reports with Dr. Shikha and didn't told her what previous doctor said. At the end of meeting we asked if we will be able to deliver normally and her answer was so impressive that we continued visiting her(it was not a yes).

Other doctor used to call us every 10 days and didn't really addressed the queries nicely and Dr. Shikha used to call us every 3 weeks and used to give good time and we always had  meaningful conversations. So we visited both doctors for 3 months and at the end of 3 months discovered Dr.Shikha is more of a family member than a doctor. She is not at all money minded person and has power to justify each and every penny you are spending at bloom clinic.
So at the end of second trimester Dr. Shikha was our only doctor.

She is a blend of old school and new school she will advise what all daadi naani does but in a more refined and quantified manner  and on the other hand she will tell you certain things which are very new and all oldies will say not to do like having water after delivery.
I would highly recommend Dr. Shikha to everyone, she tries her level best for normal delivery however you have to work on all her advises. You have to put in your hard work in exercises and have to have a balanced diet, Dr. shikha can't do anything if you don't exercise or don't follow her instructions....
Trust me if you go by what she says you will deliver a healthy baby and a normal delivery.
Thanks Dr. Shikha because of your guidance and care we were blessed with a healthy baby girl and it was a NORMAL DELIVERY..

Thanks for the review . I would like to share a few insights here . 
Lifeline hospital has closed for deliveries from last 4 years and I presume that you had delivered before that. So you writing a review after such a lag is not understandable .
As competent obstetrician we gave a fair trial of labour to every would be mother be it a weekday or Sunday as in your case and when their is meconium( as u told the baby had passed potty) with non progress it becomes an indication for cesarean section for betterment of baby and the mother . 

I appreciate that you reflected that a fair trial was given to you even on a Sunday but the tone of the review is nothing but an attempt to malign my good intentions towards  you and all mothers to be . 
The review is a concocted and distorted representation  of the facts .
Hope all is well at your end .

Dr. Shikha Gurnani was extremely welcoming. My first impression of her was she is a nice, calm, well poised, well behaved and extremely welcoming doctor. She not only gave us confidence of her availability during the pregnancy but also calmed both us. I found her an expert and the one who knows her work very well. After I came out of every visit, both of us were extremely happy that finally we found the right doctor. There was no other doubts thereafter. 
In the last month, they said that we would be doing C-sec on 16th Aug.2017 if you are not in labor pain. We went to her clinic on 16th Aug 2017. She did something on that day and advised us to go to hospital immediately. The time was 12.30 P.M. She assured her for visit in the hospital at around 3.00 P.M and she came on time and started motivating my wife for normal delivery. At around 4.22 P.M, I finally got our new baby boy in  our life. the amazing thing was that, my wife went for normal delivery and all credit goes to Shikha Gurnani.
