"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy care and management,Pregnancy Check Up,Reccurent Pregnancy Loss,",0,0,YES,"A Guiding Light on Our Journey to Parenthood.

We had an exceptional experience with Dr. Shikha Gurnani, our beautiful gynecologist. She is not just an excellent doctor but also a kind and compassionate HUMAN BEING. From the very beginning, Dr. Gurnani was a guiding light. She meticulously conducted all the necessary tests and explained everything in detail about the changes I could expect. Her approachable and friendly demeanor, coupled with her selfless service and social work, truly set her apart. I always felt comfortable and well-cared for during my visits. 

Dr. Shikha Gurnani is very polite, genuine, yet very professional. She explains every aspect of the current diagnosis in detail, whether it's positive or negative. Her treatment is effective, and she ensures that her patients receive the best care possible.

We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Shikha to every expecting parent. Her patience, empathy, and professionalism make every visit comfortable and reassuring. She takes the time to listen to concerns and provides clear instructions for a healthy pregnancy. We are incredibly grateful for her unwavering support and dedication.

She gave us a space where we have joked and laughed about anything we felt about with her. 

With a vast experience many doctors lose the human touch in their treatment and that was our biggest concern. And we can say this from bottom of our heart that it's not the case with Dr Shikha. She'll make you feel that it's her responsibility to take good care of your baby and you. 

Thank you, Dr. Shikha Gurnani, for making our dream of parenthood come true. Our beautiful daughter Twisha is a testament to your expertise and compassion. ",2024-07-21 09:38:16,False,True,Navneet Singh ,,,

Her expertise is truly commendable, providing comprehensive care with a reassuring demeanor. Her attentive approach and clear communication made me feel comfortable discussing sensitive health matters. Dr. Shikha addressed all my concerns with professionalism and compassion, ensuring I felt heard and understood. 

Since this was our first child, we were unaware of what we were getting into. Dr. Shikha constantly reassured us and kept us informed of what was happening both to my body and emotions. Every step of the way, we knew we were in good hands.

She made herself very approachable and available to me. Her passionate way of interacting with her patients made us become very faithful in her approach. She is compassionate, thoughtful, dedicated to providing the best patient care. The months leading up to the big day were full of questions and concerns, but we were handled so well by her and answered all our queries with a smile. Her calm demeanor and positive aura helped create a tranquil environment during this once in a lifetime event.

I will always be grateful for the excellent care provided by Dr. Shikha and her entire team at Bloom Vision.

From a stress-free delivery to a perfect, quick healing circumcision, the C-section was a great stress free experience.

Thank you Ma‚Äôam for making this experience a wonderful one! :) We highly recommend Dr. Shikha for her outstanding expertise and patient-centered care. A definite five-star experience. üëç

As of today, I dont mind saying that Dr. Gurnani was not only my wife's doctor for pregnancy but was like a mother and guardian angel who delivered an angel to us after three years of her medical efforts and my wife's two miscarriages.  
Would like to give you a crisp background to substantiate the headline.

First Year_Dec 2016
I went to the doctor in 2016 Dec for my wife's first pregnancy after reading reviews on practo. I can tell you that I didn't feel its my first visit, the staff was very courteous but i was concerned about the doctor considering my past experiences with other doctors who were rude and arrogant.  But doctor removed all my preconceived notions and welcomed us as she knew us before. 
Doctor started the treatment but unfortunately our baby couldn't survive more that 1.5 months and my wife went under D&C. I thought that Doctor like others will not be bothered about our loss but she tried to console us like a mother.

Second Year_Dec 2018

After the first miscarriage, we planned again in 2018 and visited the doctor. I was surprised to see that not only the staff but doctor knew our names even after 2 years. Doctor was happier than us to see us once again and she started the treatment once again but unfortunately our baby didint survive again after 1.5 months from the conception.  Doctor was also surprised with that but you cannot change whats written in your destiny.  Even in that situation i didnt lose my trust on doctor and left everything to her for further treatment whereas if it could have been other patient then they could have blamed the doctor.

Third Year_July 2019

After the completion of healing period we visited the ""same"" doctor once again in July 2019 for the treatment. I still remember the conversation, Doctor said ""I will not leave any stone unturned and will apply whatever i have learned to make you proud parents but you need to trust me"" and I replied "" I wont be standing here with my wife once again, I have immense trust in you"". Doctor advised us some tests & medicines and started the treatment. During the course of the treatment, Doctor used to advise and guide us like a mother not as a doctor. She was available for us all the time (but we didnt took advantage of that and didnt disturb her in nights and weekends unless its urgent and critical). Even this pregnancy was not a cake walk for us but doctor held our hands and walked with us throughout the pregnancy. There were high chances of caesarean but doctor was pushing for normal delivery and i was astonished when my wife delivered the baby girl in the night of 31st March through normal delivery. 

I cannot pay back ever to the doctor what she has done for us, Doctor came like a guardian angel in our life who filled our life with everlasting happiness. I can keep on writing but it will not be enough.",2020-04-13 16:11:06,False,True,Aakash Jain,thanks for the lovely words of appreciation,2020-05-11T14:28:38+0000,Dr. Shikha Gurnani
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"When u hold ur tiny angel in your hands for the first time - you become a parent. That‚Äôs what often people say, but they are wrong. 
The day one gets to know that they have conceived is when the journey of parenthood begins.
We were early birds üòÅ... figured it out in the 3rd week that we had conceived. Being proactive I had shortlisted a few and finalized onto one particular doctor basis on the reviews, rating, experience from Practo before hand.  So we rushed with the pregnancy kit test to her. 
A calm and composed, yet chirpy doctor on the other side... she had her mask on, but from her eyes I could read that she had a wide smile. She said that it looks that you have passed but let‚Äôs run some tests and be sure. That‚Äôs my baby‚Äôs first date with doctor Gurnani. 
In those 9 months I went through a lot - not being able to gain weight initially, a bit of complications in the ultra sound, a small car accident and got infected with Coronavirus ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Being from hospitality I was working 14 hours - traveling 60kms - and constantly on my feet - parents in a different city. The reason I am sharing all this is because I want you to understand what kind of support I got from her. 
There are times I would msg her with silly questions, would rush  into the clinic with serious issues and a lot more...but there was not a single time I gave a second thought about considering someone else. My husband would make fun of me, that I often found reasons to meet her as it was comforting. May be it was true.
I wanted a normal delivery. She had recommended to stay active without stressing and I chose to work till the last month and one day I was at work and wasn‚Äôt sure if I was in labor so I messaged her and rushed once she confirmed.
A samosa, a plate of chowmein and a few hours later - I had my angel in my arms.
Normal delivery - few extra stitches (as my body wasn‚Äôt ready cos it was bit ahead of EDD) but no one else could have made that moment so beautiful for me. As she was stitching me up and scolding me like a momma ... I laughed and said - u can‚Äôt get irritated - m gonna come back in a  few years for the next one. 
For me to say that on the table, at that point - you can understand what kind of trust she must have instilled in me. 
My husband and I are both chefs and in our words - like a perfect chef, she got the bun out of the oven, just right in time
Not to forget, there is pinky at the reception - she is a saviour when you need last minute help with getting an appointment on a busy day.
Loads of love

We came to know about Dr. Shikha Gurnani through one of our friend. Then we search out on practo. After reading so many positive reviews we decided to approach shikha mam for our first pregnancy in 2018. After meeting her we found her very straight forward and strict. She explained everything in detail and answered all my questions and cleared my all doubts. My pregnancy was natural and healthy. All my reports were normal.  But at 33 week I lost my child due to chord around her neck in the stomach only. I was devastated and broken. Because she approached for a normal delivery we waited for  3 days but due to hard luck we moved to c-sec. I thought I would never going to have a child. There must be some medical problem with me. But at that point of time Shikha mam supported me a lot. She promised me that you are going to have your baby in one year. I still remembered her words "" tera baccha toh me hi karungi,"" and dont know how .... i got a ray of hope. She advised me to take one year gap due to c sec. But actual struggle started now. Suddenly I started to gain weight. After 5 months of operation I visited her clinic again and she advised me to take some tests. Then we found some medical problem with me. And now before thinking about pregnancy we need to settle down my medical condition. I followed her instructions and contact to the  specialist suggested by her only. And guess what in only 2 months my health was  in control. Then after waiting for 2 more months we decided to conceive again. In January 2020 I conceived again by the grace of God. And decided to consult her only. In my 2nd pregnancy she took all the precautions she can. Due to my first pregnancy experience & this pandemic of corona,I was also very much scared. She guided me whenever I had any doubt or problem even on phone / WhatsApp.  She has lovely combination of professionalism and care. She never gave up on me, even when I had doubt about my pregnancy. One of the best doctor and person we have ever met. Her positive approach & beautiful smile made everything easy. She kept her promise  Due to her continuous efforts and by the Grace of god we are blessed with  a healthy baby boy.

I consulted her to conceive. She told me the exact situation of my hormonal issues without giving any wrong expectations. Though I was aware of my pcod and bad hormonal levels already. So it was a major concern for me that how much time it will take to resolve my issue. I planned my pregnancy after 5 years of my marriage and have a fear in my mind somewhere that people comments should not be true that in starting you are not planning and later you will be too late to conceive. But as I was not ready mentally and physically so I took risk of planning late . But when I made a decision to conceive, it was really hard to wait and made me worried. As I have wasted 1 year on homeopathic treatment for pcod and it made my pcod more worse than any improvement. So I choose Dr. Shikha after reading positive reviews on practo... And I found her exactly lucky doctor for me. She helped me to conceive within 6 months. With my bad levels of hormones, 6 months is not long time as there were possibilities of more time. I was really worried whether I will conceive or not after listening my friends stories of pcod and there conceiving time. But I conceived in 1st month of trying after getting my hormones balanced under the proper guidance of Dr. Shikha for 6 months.

No unwanted tests, no scares etc. Just the required tests and visits to make sure mom and baby were doing well. Very modern and up-to-date practices made the whole experience enjoyable. When it came to delivery of both my babies, the combined care of Shikha Mam and her staff at hospital made my delivery process smooth and that too a normal delivery even though I had some complications in my first delivery.

She always guided us with actual scenario and we also trusted her and simply followed each and every advise given by her throughout my pregnancy.  She gives proper time to all the patients regardless of the queue of patients at clinic. The clinic is also very clean and hygienic. She never recommended unnecessary medications and tests. Apart from regular visits, she was always available 24 hrs for all our queries and responds quickly whenever we needed.

We are blessed with a baby boy on 11th December 2019. I really feel short of words to express thanks and gratitude to Dr. Shikha Gurnani. Thank you so much Mam for guiding us and handling my pregnancy and delivery so smoothly and effectively. May God bless you with all the success and happiness in your life. We highly recommend Dr. Shikha Gurnani to all couples searching for gynaecologist. *** ** *** **** ************* *** *** **** *****

Thanks for the review . I would like to share a few insights here . 
Lifeline hospital has closed for deliveries from last 4 years and I presume that you had delivered before that. So you writing a review after such a lag is not understandable .
As competent obstetrician we gave a fair trial of labour to every would be mother be it a weekday or Sunday as in your case and when their is meconium( as u told the baby had passed potty) with non progress it becomes an indication for cesarean section for betterment of baby and the mother . 

I appreciate that you reflected that a fair trial was given to you even on a Sunday but the tone of the review is nothing but an attempt to malign my good intentions towards  you and all mothers to be . 
The review is a concocted and distorted representation  of the facts .
Hope all is well at your end .

Both mother and child were healthy. Journey of my child from his mother's womb to his house was very beutiful, smooth and comfortable.
