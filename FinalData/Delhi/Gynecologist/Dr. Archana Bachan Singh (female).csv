None,None,0,0,NO,"On 4.9.15, I along with my husband visited to Dr. Archana Bachan Singh in OPD with prior appointment. My Max ID is EHPG.557349, after billing my token n. AA0003 displayed on the screen and after 20 minutes it disappeared from the screen and next token no. Called in OPD. On requesting this problem was rectified. During the visit Dr. Archana Bachan Singh told that my pregnancy is 26 week and I can't take your case. When we asked the reason she replied ""this is hospital rule that we can't take case of pregnancy over 24 weeks. She refused to give me further treatment. On asking that we have many cases in our knowledge that you treated after 24 weeks she rudely replied that "" talk to the management"". My husband went to the corporate office in the basement and requested to provide medical treatment to a pregnant lady but they replied "" jab doctor ESA keh rahi Hain to hum kya kar skte Hain pehle to tum sarkari hospital mein jate ho bad mein yahain kyon aate ho"". On asking that give it in written that you cant take pregnancy case over 24 weeks, management told ""doctor se likhwao"". On asking to Dr. Archana bacchan singh to give it written she told that "" MS likh kar dengen"". My husband went to 4th floor to meet M/S of the hospital but he was not available in the office and matter was also discussed with a senior doctor on 4th floor, but no fruitful result came. This is refusal for treatment (refusal of service) to a pregnent lady.",2015-09-10 14:10:18,False,False,Nisha,,,
