Never ignore the red flags when you visit a doctor.",2018-08-07 17:58:03,False,False,Priyanka Saluja,"Dear Priyanka,

Its heartening.
Let me respond your all issues one by one:

#1.""Desire Result"" comes out when you follow doctor's instructions. If you use your own intelligence and behave like that you are more knowledgeable than doctor then its really difficult for any doctor to treat you.

#2. Sometimes it really difficult for  a doctor to recognize every patient over the phone call. Just think, You were not able to remember a simple medicine name and you were expecting that doctor should remember your medical  history,  medcine prescribed , test result over the phone ?

Always visit doctor in-person and give priority to doctor visit over other things.

#3. ""Lesson Learnt"" - I really like this word.
Yes! life is full of lessons and giving us chance everyday to  beome better human being.
When you visit any doctor next time,  i hope by that time you will learn to  "" Respect for Individual"" n ""Respect other times"" n ""Ablility to listen"" etc..
I also learnt a lession. Best of luck.

#4. ""Visit a doctor with Red Flag"" - its really good to keep red flag when you visit a doctor and keep showing that to your noworth knowledge of medicine and anger.

- I wish you healthly Life.
