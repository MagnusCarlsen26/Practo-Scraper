"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Total Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,"“God sends angels when we are in trouble” I experienced this and met this angel Dr Meeta Verma, a brilliant doctor when I was detected with 7.5 cm long fibroid and enlarged uterus. When others were suggesting open surgery , she removed fibroids and uterus through laproscopy with her magical hands. She deals with the patient like a psychologist as well. She gave me all strength and confidence that made my recovery so smooth.
Thank you so much Dr Meeta Verma. I simply love you and believe you more than myself. You are a genuine soul and excellent gynaecologist.",2024-02-20 16:40:23,False,True,Meenu Arora,,,
"Treatment satisfaction,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"** **** ***** * *** ** *** **** ************* * **** **** ****** ** ***** **** I reside in Gurgaon and visited 3-4 Gynaecologists here for my pregnancy in the top hospitals. However, I was not satisfied, nor I was given proper medication. I was misguided by a doctor here who works in a top hospital (I do not wish to name) last year. The procedures done were just not satisfactory, and it landed up spoiling my health further.

Then, one of my family member, referred Dr Mita (she is in Moolchand Hospital and has a clinic in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi). I met her and the way she explained things (considering first pregnancy), gave me medication, took extra care was incredible. She doesn't recommend extra or unnecessary tests, and always gives logic on what and why she is recommending any procedure or test. She is professional in her approach, yet personal if you are stressed (yes, this is common in pregnancy!). I have been visiting her for 1.5 years, and finally only because of her guidance and support, I’m blessed with a baby boy. She isn’t just a doctor for me, but a well-wisher. On my delivery, she was equally happy, like my family. I will recommend her to everyone who is planning their family, or even have issues related. *** ** *** *********** ***************",2022-09-21 16:07:06,False,True,Vani Bhalla,,,

Recovered well in time with proper medication and expert guidance from the doctor. She made an intricate procedure look very easy. Highly recommend her.

"Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Gynae Problems,Adiana System,Laparoscopy Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,My laproscopic hysterectomy was done by Dr. Mita Verma. She has been my gynac since the birth of my son in 2012. She was aware of all the medical complications that I have. I am allergic to different groups of medicines (as I had TEN) however she is the only doctor who I could trust to take care of this surgery. She has been doing laproscopic surgery since it started in India. That is why I feel she is one of the best in this procedure...,2023-12-16 07:29:22,False,True,Poulami Banerjee,,,
