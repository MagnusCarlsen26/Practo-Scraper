"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnant Women Counseling,",0,0,YES,I came to Dr. Anuradha Tamaria because of checks during my pregnancy. As a foreigner on holiday in Delhi. Dr. Tamaria explained to me with all patience and understanding how she works. I had the 20-week and 30-week check with her. She explained to me very clearly what certain medical terms mean and which vitamins and minerals I definitely had to use. My experience with this doctor and her team are excellent. ,2020-01-28 18:49:56,False,True,Monique,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",,0,0,YES,"Overall it was good, however even though we booked appointment in advance, it was raining, ran from our offices early in Gurgaon to reach on time.
