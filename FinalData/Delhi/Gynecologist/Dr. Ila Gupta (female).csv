"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"Me and my mother in law visited dictor ila gupta for my pregnancy checkup. I had all the tests done except the blood sugar report. Since it was my first time and second visit to the doctor i had many questions in my mind which is why visited doctor. In my first visit i just got the confirmation that i am prgnant but she did not explain or discussed anything related so i had to visit her again with full of questions.
But there Doctor was rude. And asked us to leave and visit her after i had my ultrasound and blood sugar done. The way of talking was not acceptable. Her impatient nature and not giving proper time to patient made a negative impact on us. ",2018-11-11 07:30:51,False,False,Ankita,,,
