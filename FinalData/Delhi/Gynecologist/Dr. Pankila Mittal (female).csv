We met Dr Pankila in 2023 and in March 2024 we were blessed with a cute baby girl. 
Since the beginning of our pregnancy she helped and guided us in the best possible manner with each and every question we had related to pregnancy. She was always available to support us on the phone/ whatsapp when required. Every visit feels like that we are meeting our own family member.
Her guidance and attention to details during prenatal,Intranatal and post natal period were beyond commendable.
And trust me, Whenever we visit her clinic we had lots of worries & queries in our mind as it was our first pregnancy but everytime she does some magic with her Jaadu ki jhappi that all our anxieties and fears just flew away 
Moving on to my delivery experience, My Delivery is not planned one as due to some complications, I delivered early from my due date. It was premature delivery so we were in so panic situation but Pankila Ma‚Äôam handled everything very smoothly. I remember how she comforted me and encouraged me in OT as I am feeling very anxious and emotionally low. Thank you so much ma‚Äôam and seriously mam you are no less thn a God to me at that moment. 
We are truly blessed to have you as our doctor. You are really a gem to our society. Really thankful to you for all your kind words, support & guidance throughout our wonderful journey.

Since the beginning of our pregnancy, She helped and guided us in the best possible manner with each and every question we had related to pregnancy. She also assisted us with diet plans and exercises for each trimester. 
With each trimester she prepared us mentally for the delivery process. She does her work so passionately,  that i never thought of her as my doctor, she is more like a friend to us. She is just a call away to any of our concern .
From the very first day she motivated me for normal delivery and she also helped me with achieving the same.
Would highly recommend to future mommies.

I had bio chemical pregnancy at early stage and I was very disappointed but mam always motivated me and told me to try to conceive naturally.
But after unsuccesful natural attempts we shifted to follicular monitoring as suggested by mam. I had two cycles of follocular monitoring but those two were also unsuccesful but mam always motivated me to never loose hopeüôÇ and after taking proper medications suggested by mam I got to see those two pink lines.
I was on bed rest due to some complications in my pregnancy but mam was always there to explain my problems and clear all my doubts. 
At the time of delivery I had water leakage at 1 am and I called her and  she asked me to reach hospital asap.  So I think for any doubts or any emergency she is just a call or msg away .
Mam was in touch with the doctors till I reached my hospital and got checked and admitted by doctors. I had a very smooth delivery with her. 
She is very friendly and knowledgable doctor and I am blessed that I opted her as my doctor.

She prescribed me with the right exercises and diet, which I followed religiously. All this culminated in a normal delivery without complications.

Honestly speaking I had been struggling to find a good gynae here (sasural) for last 3 years and had to visit my old gynae near maeka which was far away. With you my search for gynae is over.
The way you handled my case and made me calm is beyond my thinking. From taking my case in 3rd trimester to taking quick decision for my delivery is what shows about you that how much you take every case personally. At the time of delivery too , i was really scared for the operation but with you there by my side everything was very smooth. With all these things we did not feel at a single moment that we are in the hands of doctor, we felt like you are our family.

Everything went well during my pregnancy but there has to be a turning point....in a smooth sailing. She rushed to the hospital when baby's heart beat dropped and she came to the ot and said don't worry...I'll look into everything.

Dear friends when you are going through tough times you need someone to give you reassurance, so believe in her, follow her advises whether it's exercises, or high protein diet or sleep. Things will work in your favour.

I had fast normal delivery and it happened in an hour only so dont panic and trust your doctor. She is the best guide, mentor, doctor, friend and treated us none other than but like a family. Our bond has become so strong that we wont be able to forget those 9 months being with her. From the bottom of my heart, I would like to say that Im gonna miss her a lot, her beautiful gesture and lovely smiley face always. She used to give us 20-25 minutes to discuss and answered each query. Last but not the least, Dr Pankila is the bestest Doctor ever met/seen /visited . Wish you all the best Mam for everything.
