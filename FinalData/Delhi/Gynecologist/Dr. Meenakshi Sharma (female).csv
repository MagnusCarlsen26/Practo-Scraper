None,None,0,0,YES,"Since long I was thinking to write a review on Dr. Meenakshi as she deserves to be appreciated.
I reviewed many gynecologist online before consulting her but with my personal experience I am saying she is best gynecologist in the city. I would like to stitch all the best threads in my memory for her-
1. As I was working during my pregnancy she used to come in evening for me (as due to corona and Delhi pollution she consult patients only in morning timing)
2. She is friendly and u can talk to her ask your queries without any hesitation.
3. More than a medicine I always believe a pregnant woman need correct guidance and positively that you will get every time u will consult mam.
4. She is modern doc, she will mail  your prescription for your ready reference and u don't need special degree to read it as its not hand written, you can send ur reports over mail or whatsapp, unlike other docs I read about or know, she will positively respond you, in case of emergency she is just at a call/msg away. If you call her she will attend you over call without boundaries of time but I always prefer to msg her first as I respect everyone's personal life.
5. When my due date was near and my water break she attended my call on 2nd ring and till birth of my baby (She even guided me in early weeks of post pregnancy) I never had fear to call her and she was on time to check my progress toward delivery.
6. Ma'am is dedicated and sincere toward her job, I delivered baby in 2nd phase of corona pandemic, everyone said no Dr will do normal delivery and I was worried for the same, but mam said ur and baby health is important if everything will remain under control why I will do c section? And I had normal delivery.
 I wanna write lot more about my experience but no one will read so much text.
In short she is sincere, frendly,dedicated, honest doctor for you to welcome your little one in this world, without any doubt you can consult her.
