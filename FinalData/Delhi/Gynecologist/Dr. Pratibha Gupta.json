Her medicines and treatment have been up to the mark. I was so confident about her that I didnt take any second opinion throughout the pregnancy. She was always available for us. We troubled her with multiple queries but she listened all of them patiently and provided solution to each one of them. No unnecessary tests were advised. My pregnancy and delivery both  went smooth. I was super tensed about the delivery but trust me she calmed me down and made it one of the most memorable moment of my life and now I do not fear about planning my second child. The hospital was hygienic, staff was polite and helpful. The room I stayed in after delivery was comfortable, ventilated and had adequate sunlight which turned out to be very beneficial as I delivered in winters. *************** *** ****** ** ************* *** ****** ** *** ****** I have very high faith in her and she has become like family and will continue to be my regular gynae.\nHighly recommend her! \nThankyou so much ma\u2019am for being always there for us and adding happiness into our family.

Dr. Pratibha told me not to worry and gave me the medicine. She was very polite and friendly. Then I got conceived in Jan 2021, and I was happy to visit her again basis on my first experience with her. From the start she was handling my case, my placenta was low lying throughout my pregnancy which lead to c-section. I wasn't well prepared for c-section mentally and few of my relatives also scared me for that. I shared the same with the Dr. Pratibha, she listened and explained everything to me in a clear manner and assured me that I will be completely fine after the delivery, only I have to be strong. I had c-section on 1st October, and I would say it wasn't that scary as I was thinking earlier and I was feeling better after 2 days and came back home. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. The hospital ambience and staff is great and helpful. I highly recommend becoming her patient. Thank you so much doctor for this wonderful experience and my baby girl :)",

Got her reference through \"GOOGLE baba\" and I think that was the best reference I got from Universe because Dr. Pratibha is not just a very good doctor but a lady with good heart. She is truly a well wisher of her patients. At the time of delivery I insisted her for surgery but for my goodness she took risk and helped me to deliver normally.  She is a pure soul. Whole team of Healing Hands is very cooperative and helping. May God bless Dr. Pratibha for this great service of humanity. ",

Her medicines and treatment have been up to the mark. I was so confident about her that I didnt take any second opinion throughout the pregnancy. She was always available for us. We troubled her with multiple queries but she listened all of them patiently and provided solution to each one of them. No unnecessary tests were advised. My pregnancy and delivery both  went smooth. I was super tensed about the delivery but trust me she calmed me down and made it one of the most memorable moment of my life and now I do not fear about planning my second child. The hospital was hygienic, staff was polite and helpful. The room I stayed in after delivery was comfortable, ventilated and had adequate sunlight which turned out to be very beneficial as I delivered in winters. *************** *** ****** ** ************* *** ****** ** *** ****** I have very high faith in her and she has become like family and will continue to be my regular gynae.\nHighly recommend her! \nThankyou so much ma\u2019am for being always there for us and adding happiness into our family.

Dr. Pratibha told me not to worry and gave me the medicine. She was very polite and friendly. Then I got conceived in Jan 2021, and I was happy to visit her again basis on my first experience with her. From the start she was handling my case, my placenta was low lying throughout my pregnancy which lead to c-section. I wasn't well prepared for c-section mentally and few of my relatives also scared me for that. I shared the same with the Dr. Pratibha, she listened and explained everything to me in a clear manner and assured me that I will be completely fine after the delivery, only I have to be strong. I had c-section on 1st October, and I would say it wasn't that scary as I was thinking earlier and I was feeling better after 2 days and came back home. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. The hospital ambience and staff is great and helpful. I highly recommend becoming her patient. Thank you so much doctor for this wonderful experience and my baby girl :)",

Got her reference through \"GOOGLE baba\" and I think that was the best reference I got from Universe because Dr. Pratibha is not just a very good doctor but a lady with good heart. She is truly a well wisher of her patients. At the time of delivery I insisted her for surgery but for my goodness she took risk and helped me to deliver normally.  She is a pure soul. Whole team of Healing Hands is very cooperative and helping. May God bless Dr. Pratibha for this great service of humanity. ",

Doctor Pratibha just asked her peon for our reports and didn\u2019t invite us in her clinic room to discuss the reports instead came out and started discussing the patients case in the waiting area with others present without considering our privacy ** ******** ******* Really disturbed and unhappy with the behaviour and would not recommend the doctor.",

I think you visited me some couple of months back and no doubt I diagnosed your wife having jaundice before having her admitted. As you said she had high jaundice... So to my understanding pregnancy with high jaundice is a high risk pregnancy which can cause damage to the developing baby as well  as mother and therefore mandates admission and monitoring. Hats off to your doctor who treated you without admission. I am happy that your  wife recovered from that episode of jaundice and delivered a healthy baby.  But you can never deny the complications associated with jaundice which by God's grace did not happen in your case. Anyways thanks that you made out time after so many months to give a feedback to me. Best wishes.... Dr Pratibha Gupta. ",

Upon my friend suggestion,  we immediately left Orchid and went to see other doctor.  Dr. suggested there is no need to get admitted go home and take proper rest.

On the face of it, the hospital facilities might look like any other nursing home but hey, never judge the book by its cover. Healing hands is a gem in a haystack and is highly recommended. The cleanliness is by far the best abd the staff is very polite and friendly. Kudos to the entire healing hands team for such a smooth 9 month journey. Much love, Chhavi Jalaj Jain ",

We irritated you as well by repeating same questions from differnt angles but as I said earlier we as first time parents are impatient.\n\nThank you ma'am very much for giving us healthy baby and watching over the health of the mother. \n   \nTo conclude:\nPast (Before Deilvery) We treated you as our Family Doctor \nPresent( After Deilvery) - We still think you are our Family doctor\nFuture - you will always remain our family doctor.",

She was not ready to listen to my problems and just wanted to get rid of me ASAP. She was as cold as ice and was pretty rude for a doctor. I tried to clear as many doubts as I could but she hardly gave me answers. I am never going back to her. I did because my doctor was not available on that Sunday. I have been lucky enough to have good and warm doctors to go to. This was an awful experience. \r\n\r\nP.S: A doctor needs to make his/her patient comfortable. It is really important for me at least.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNisha Negi",

Small smile on her face can make patients feel little better. Specially knowing mostly pregnant ladies visit the place, should be welcoming towards them. You don't know what other person is visting for what problem, small gestures make a lot of difference.\nAgain, Doctor Pratibha is a great lady. Very positive, polite and makes you feel very comfortable. ",

She's very polite and friendly, and very easy to open up to. For those of you who fear being judged or have trouble talking to, I would strongly suggest you to visit Dr. Gupta. I have been to several gynecologists, and have had my best experience with Dr. Pratibha Gupta. My search for my care provider is now over, she's definitely my go to gynecologist for future purposes.
