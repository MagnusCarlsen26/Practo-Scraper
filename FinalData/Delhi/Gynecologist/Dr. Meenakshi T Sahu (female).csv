"Value for money,",None,0,0,NO,"I think the consultation fee should be nominal so that's it's affordable . Spent Rs 1000 that's like too much and that too , where there's no treatment done . After spending this much , didn't get satisfaction at all. Though the doctor is polite and listens properly .
