During the complete journey after conceiving to birth of a child she does give proper note of each visits to patient's which helps is guidance for each step of the pregnancy.
She knows how to set an example with such an advise if something needs to be taken care seriously and to be followed by patient. Also if patient is panicking for something which is not really important, she does proper counselling so the patient is at comfort. Also despite having a busy schedule all over the day, while listening or addressing to patient she gives proper ear/advise/time.

Any emergency situation, patient is always the first priority in Dr. Neha's list.
