Cons:
Biggest con is that I was showing her at fortis Gurgaon n after 2 trimesters she told me that she won't b available during delivery as she is based out of Delhi. I didn't see any point in showing a gynea when she isn't available during delivery 

In last trimester I changed my doctor.  

A little moody especially during rush hours she rushes through",2017-06-15 19:47:45,False,True,Riti Bhargava,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"I started consulting Dr. Aneja in my third trimester.
She diagnosed my gestational diabetes in my 7.5 month of pregnancy.
This was discovered on her gut when she told me to do my sugar test again.
She helped get an appointment from the best Urologist so that my case would be personally looked after by the top specialist. It was impossible to get an appointment without her involvement.
Inspite of my condition she pushed me to have a normal delivery and then when I had to be rushed for an emergency c-sec because they baby went into distress she took care & handled it smoothly. Next morning of the operation I was up and about and had no discomfort or complications.
I highly recommend her.
