"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I feel lucky living in Vasant Kunj because of close proximity and able to find a gem like Dr.Mamta Mishra. Not only me me but my baby feel connected to her voice and aura during those 9 months.
i am giving this feedback in two parts, one how she is as a person and another as a doctor.

Person:- I feel your behaviour matters when you are doctor, at the end they are also human being with medical gift. She is outrightly one of most modest person despite being so successful. I love the way she handles financial subjects very clear cut ,considerate and realist. You can ask and she will clarify all the financial queries of yours. Infact she will be considerate about your money and her response is so apt. She is practical and yet you are her precious patient whom she cares a lot. She has a bit of philosophical side which puts you at such a ease while talking to her

Doctor- complete knowledge about her field, you just have to ask the right question. I have visited her clinic mostly and fortis hospital in the 3rd trimester. During every visit she will do her observation with concentration then will give you time to ask your queries. I feel she finds her clinic very close to her heart and very caring in that space. She did forget me as a patient during the initial trimester but again cant pinpoint her for that. I liked her as a person and her positive aura as a doctor. I have understood her nature and showed my honest trust on her advice. 

Procedure: My 9 month of pregnancy was less complicated and same feeling was created by Dr. Mamta Mishra. There was subserosal fibroid but that didn’t interfere with pregnancy. I chose to  get delivered by Ma’am hence chose fortis as my delivery hospital. At the end there was slight issue of gestational diabetics which might have been resulted in insulin injection but not needed at the end. After 38 week I was given induced labor pain under the guidance of Mamta ma’am which was successful and i delivered a healthy baby after 12 hrs of induction process. There was flow of blood from Utreus after delivery whose reason was unknown. But ma’am was able to stop the blood flow and stopped the mishappening , the procedure took another 1 hr and episiotomy stitched given by ma’am was perfectly intact. I am writing this 1 week after my delivery. 

I would recommend every aspiring pregnant women to her for better guidance and relaxing 9 months. If any further information needed please reach out.

Thankyou Mamta Ma’am

This goes same as every politician is corrupt except few who try to maintain moral ethics and work to help others. She is one of them! The only doctor (out of all those i know) who follow medical ethics.
You will NEVER be disappointed consulting her.
She motivated me and my wife for normal delivery throughout and at the time of delivery i was about to give up seeing my wife in pain and then she came and motivated my wife to go for normal delivery though we delivered it in fortis and i have had very bad experience with fortis that i had it in mind that the doctor will go for C section at the end saying there is no other option without even trying as what a trend is going on but mam(Dr.mamta mishra) did not even offer C section and went for normal delivery.
At the end of the day we have a baby and she has all our respect for restoring faith in doctors.

Now lets come to financials
She will try to save your money as much as you try
Let me give you an example which touched me and my wife. One day we had an ultrasound scheduled and mam did ultrasound for more than a hour and at the end she wanted some more clarification in ultrasound so she recommended 2nd advice and after standing for more than an hour she did not charge a single penny.
And there are n number of incidents like this
And before consulting her we went to a doctor who was charging money for almost every thing in fact she tried to go for a specific labs for test to get commission.

She(Dr Mamta Mishra) is always on your side! If you go once you will never consult any other doctor

I am writing this review while she is examining my wife for discharge and the word she said that she does not want to keep my wife admitted because she doesn't want to put more burden on our pockets!

And to help you!
Fortis charged Rs.64000 (as we took general ward package which is totally great as fortis maintains high cleanliness quality standards) for delivery including everything as we had a normal delivery. This cost will increase by Rs.12000 if you opt for epidural which we didn't and also Rs.10000 willbe added if you go for C Section

Thank you mam and staff of fortis which is as nice as Dr.Mamta mishra mam

I was so happy and positive to see how a busy doctor can spend so much time on your case. She mentioned that I have to undergo Endometriosis and fibroid removal surgery because the fibroids & Endo are too big in size and they are blocking my pregnancy. She said she will try for laparoscopic myomectomy but the chances are low. I was so positive with Dr Mamta and decided to get this surgery done. March 2021 was the month of my surgery, Dr Mamta tried her best and removed all my fibroids with “Laparoscopic Myomectomy”.

We had heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were actually afraid if we will be able to manage that. But her simple advices, 24/7 availability for your problems, calm and composed approch to your issues, her motivation in labor room and no extra expense are just few to state.

Only doc I have visited recently who does not have any tie up with any lab and you can get your tests done anywhere you want, No issues of medicines being available at a particular shop (you will easily get anywhere and they are not expensive), no supplements till it is actually required as she will motivate you to get those from natural food are again just few things you will love about her.

Dr. Mamta Mishra is one of such doctors. I started consulting in my 5th month after having an unsatisfactory experience with my previous gynaecologist who categorized my pregnancy as high risk and suggested complete bed rest. It was only after I met Dr. Mamta that I started feeling confident being pregnant and got back on my feet, doing regular chores without any unnecessary fears. She doesn't treat pregnancy as sickness and encourage you to enjoy the journey to its fullest. 

Fast forward to labour and delivery woes during last trimester, she made us understand our options and helped us take the right decisions at the right time. Unlike most Gynaecologist in India, she and her entire team were very flexible and encouraged me to try out different methods to cope up with painful contractions. My labour and delivery experience was beyond satisfactory and I am glad that with the right support I could deliver normally without any unnecessary medication or need for an emergency C-section.

I still remember the day when my wife gave me the good news that soon we are going to have a cute baby in our life with this my search begin for a good doctor.In this era of internet i begin my search with practo and came across the profile of Dr. Mamta Mishra where i found all the feedbacks favourable to visit her. She is very polite who always encourages to go for normal delivery. She always provide ample amount of time to the patient being at face to face or on phone call. At times i bothered her during the odd times on call but she always provided the solution. One can send the reports to her on whatsapp and discuss it over call that act as saviour when you are out of town and cannot make a visit to her. She will not put you on lots of medicines rather encourage to have more fruits, vegetables,pulses etc. She understand the query of patients very well and explains the situation with all pros and cons and does not make you panic for unnecessary things.What i most like about her is the personal touch and understanding she renders in helping the patients.We wished normal delivery and it was the trust on her which gave us strength and made it happen.

We found her treatment to be very professional taking care of all the possibilities.  Her more than two decades of experience  was visible in her treatment. She used to explain the things to us and also, addresses any query regarding anything . 
She has a very friendly approach towards patients. She is available on mobile in case of any emergency / urgent appointment. Even many a times, we used to watsapp the report if nothing else was required in that visit .
More than all this, we found her to be a lot more empathetic towards patients in comparison to other doctors ( we were consulting in Moolchand before her ). There's a personal touch to your case . She does her best to take care of everything. 
My wife opted for C section herself due to her suffering from minor heart issue (MVP) and we were scared after the complications in early stages of pregnancy. The doc said that normal delivery could be carried out, but only if she agrees. 

I wud definitely rate her 10/10 for her care and advises and wud visit her in future for related treatments for my wife.
