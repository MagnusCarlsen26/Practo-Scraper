"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOS,",0,0,YES,"I had been struggling with bladder control since a very young age. I had gone from countless pediatricians to countless gynecologists and urologists explaining my symptoms, to no end. I used to have a burning sensation on peeing every time and sometimes it would get so bad that I would bleed from my urethra. I would be inside an emergency room howling with pain every 3 months. I would explain my symptoms endlessly to the on-call doctors the follow-up Gynecologist or the urologist in the OPD the next day, just to be told that my symptoms were not that severe and I must have had early period spotting. I was always handed a pack of antibiotics for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and pain medication and sent on my way. I had really lost my faith in medical science for women to the point I would go to the emergency room and never go for the follow-up OPD as I knew exactly what I would be prescribed - an overly strong anti-biotic and pain meds followed by ""drink cranberry juice or have cranberry supplements"". I discovered so much medication for myself on my own by reading on the internet and started experimenting and trying to increase my pain threshold. Until one day I came across Dr. Karishma's profile and I decided to get on a video consultation with her. She did not dismiss my pain. She did not dismiss my claim to have blood in my urine or coming from my urethra. She was the first doctor to believe me and she told me that I maybe don't have UTI in the first place and maybe this is a bigger problem. she called me in for a physical examination and for the first time it was informed to me to get to the root of my problem I diagnostic procedure called cystoscopy will have to be performed. I underwent the cystoscopy which she herself performed on me. she took care of me after the procedure to ensure I was not in any kind of pain. And after that, she gave me the diagnosis that I had been searching for my entire life - interstitial cystitis. It is a chronic disease of the bladder which causes UTI-like symptoms but is not UTI. She started my treatment course. And ever since I walked into her office, I have not had to see the insides of an emergency room again. it has been 11 months. She has helped me greatly with my condition. I do not have to live in fear of peeing anymore. I can finally pee pain-free all thanks to her. and my bladder has not bled once since I met her.  She is a brilliant urogynecologist, the smartest doctor I have met in my life, and the friendliest and most caring person. She will move her schedule around her patients' needs. She will listen patiently and without any judgment. She even helped me with my extremely painful period cramps due to PCOS, which would render me bed-ridden for many days.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pelvic Floor Dysfunction,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Karishma in Delhi from the US. I was facing difficulty in urination. Symptoms were a very slow stream, frequent use of toilet (every hour) and frequent cases of UTI. After spending 2 years with top urologists in the US, my problem did not resolve. I was told this would stay for lifetime and the only way was to do self catheterization.

I reached out to Dr. Karishma via Practo for an opinion. I liked her approach very much that I decided to visit Delhi for treatment. She was very systematic in diagnosing the problem. She explained to me all possible causes of high urinary retention and started ruling out reasons one at a time, by running the necessary tests like Uroflowmetry, Urodynamics, MCU. She was super patient in answering my many questions. Her explanations were logical and she made it easy to understand and follow along why certain tests are needed and the treatment that would follow. The root cause was found to be a urethral stricture. This was unexpected for a person of young age like me especially given that I had no history of any surgery or childbirth. Dr. Karishma led the cystoscopy and surgery to remove the stricture. During my entire stay, she involved other doctors from her team as well to get a second opinion as needed. I did my visits at Sama Hospital, the staff at hospital was very cooperative and  supportive which made my visits very comfortable. 

Dr. Karishma fixed my problem 100%. The flow of urine stream improved drastically!  
Instead of going to the toilet 12-13 times a day, I went to the toilet 4-5 times a day like a person with a normal bladder. I never had to do self catheterization on a daily basis like what the doctors in the US had recommended. Since I don’t have to use the toilet frequently, I am able to do day to day activities without having to worry about being around the toilet every hour whether it is at a restaurant, a place outside home, the office, the parks, etc. Getting treatment from Dr. Karishma has been a huge blessing for me.

So here goes my story. In July, 2020, I experienced burning sensation while passing urine. I consulted a doctor & was prescribed with antibiotics. I took two courses of antibiotics. The burning sensation left but the pain & tenderness never went away. Further, I consulted several doctors (including specialists) who diagnosed me with UTI (even though my urine reports were coming normal). I was prescribed with antibiotics, antifungals & cranberry syrup. However, I didn't find any relief. I kept asking doctors if I have Bladder Pain Syndrome but didn't get any satisfactory answer. With each passing day my misery & anxiety kept on increasing. Then one day I randomly searched for Urogynaecologists on Google & came across Dr. Karishma. I read the feedbacks on the Practo app & could relate with many patients who had similar problem like mine. In the first visit itself, Dr. Karishma told me what was going wrong with my body & explained everything very calmly to me & my parents. She did a cystoscopy to confirm my condition & I was diagnosed with Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial Cystitis. Then she started my treatment which included strict diet, bladder instillations, pelvic floor physiotherapy (very important part) apart from oral medications. Two months down the treatment I would say I am in a much better condition. During each visit, Dr. Karishma fills me with so much positivity & she has always guided me very well. The best part about her is that she is extremely sincere & dedicated towards her work & she's very punctual. She has a very positive & friendly attitude towards her patients because of which I didn't hesitate in asking her any questions.

She explained me what was my problem, what could be the plausible cause, what will be the line off treatment and how long the treatment will have to continue. I was diagnosed with urethera stenosis which she establsihed with cystoscopy. This was fixed by urinary cathetrization for 15 days followed by bladder instillations , physiotherapies and diet modifications.

I had tons of antibiotics through all these years degrading my overall experience uski tu of life and health.

I followed the diet modifications and medication she gave me, bladder instillations as suggested and then cystoscopy. No complications at all.

She did a detailed study of my history, went through each and every report for the past 15 years and understood my issues in depth. She systematically went through all my health problems and started addressing them one by one.  I started visiting her every week for physiotherapy and taking the medication and following her advice to the T.  She assured me that there was nothing majorly wrong which also helped me to cope. With every passing week, I started feeling better, in fact there was a huge improvement in the first week itself.  Most of all, she treated me with so much dignity and respect that I had never got from any other doctor. I am much better now, in fact I feel I have got my life back.

Moreover, she just told me everything about the way of the treatment would be done. For me the best thing was she is a lady doctor. I could have shared my problems with her well without feeling hesitated. She usually behaves very well with every patient. 
Just as my treatment began I started feeling better slowly slowly. As compared to the past treatments I was feeling far better. Now, to be very Frank I'm feeling so nice as my treatment was done well. I used to be upset in recent years but now all sadness is gone and I'm better. Furthermore, I feel so good to meet her. She always understands my problem that is why. 
Now, I don't have any tension regarding my problem because DR. Karishma Thariani is there to get me out of any matter of concern related to my disease. 

I would recommend to every patient( suffering from the same ) to meet DR. Karishma Mam.
