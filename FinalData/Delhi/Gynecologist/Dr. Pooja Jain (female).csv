None,None,0,0,YES,"I highly recommend Dr. Pooja for anyone seeking exceptional gynecological care. From the moment I walked into the clinic, I felt welcomed and well-cared for. The staff were friendly and efficient, and scheduling appointments was always convenient.

Dr. Pooja herself is incredibly knowledgeable and professional. During my visits, she took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and provided thorough explanations for any questions I had. Her expertise was evident in the way she handled my examinations and procedures with precision and care. She created a comfortable environment, which made discussing sensitive health issues much easier. She showed genuine compassion and empathy, which reassured me throughout my appointments.

I am grateful for the excellent care I received under Dr.’s guidance. ",2024-07-10 06:54:58,False,True,laxmi bansal patient,,,

None,"PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Endometriosis Treatment,",0,0,NO,A cyst was discovered in my right ovary accidentally in a KUB ultrasound and visited dr Pooja for a possible diagnosis of endometriosis with no history or symptoms. I was seeking a second opinion as my gynae told me to take the wait and watch approach as the cyst usually disappears on it’s own post the period. However I thought I’d take a second opinion with dr Pooja as I was a little worried. She told me to go on contraceptive immediately and even went on to say it has no side effects which we all know on the contrary disrupts your whole system. I was extremely disappointed with my consultation and expressed the same confusion during the appointment without any reassurance or explanation from dr Pooja. I just did a follow up ultrasound on advise of my other gynae and my cyst has disappeared. *** ******* **** ****** ** **** ******** **** * ******* ***** ** ****** *** ***** ******* ** *** ***** ** ***** ******* ** *** ******* **** *** ** ***** ***** *** ***** *** ******** ************ WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HER   ,2024-06-03 08:11:52,False,False,Jasmin kaur,,,
