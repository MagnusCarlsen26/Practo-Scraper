And Anti-D injection was administrated after 6 days which should  had been done within 72 hours of abortion. That was the big mistake of our life. Which caused a big problem in next pregnancy. After 6 months, we planned and visited gynecologist. She advised us to go for ICT test, which came out positive. Which means that its impossible to sustain pregnancy. It will again abort the pregnancy. We consulted with some other doctors also. They said that we had never seen this report as positive in our life. Everyone said that it might be difficult to conceive. Pray to God. Then someone suggested us to visit Dr. Seema Jain.\nMe and My Wife visited Dr. Seema Jain and produced all the reports to her. She took it in very cool manner. And said us that its not a problem at all. You don't worry. At that day, we found a new ray of hope after losing hopes. She treated and always cleared all of our doubts. She used to talk like a family member. She is very nice doctor and lady as well.\nWe blessed with a baby girl on 03rd August 2020. And this is possible only due to Dr. Seema Jain. My words are less to thank her. Thank you very much mam.\n",

Thereafter they missed out on informing us about different test details (telling theirs no fasting test then wasting our time while getting to know it is fasting test), not giving complete info, not taking care of applying stamp on ultrasound (again we had to take off another day from work bcoz they missed out on stamp and yet didn\u2019t accept their mistake.

After 6 months, we planned and visited gynecologist. She advised us to go for ICT test, which came out positive. Which means that its impossible to sustain pregnancy. It will again abort the pregnancy. We consulted with some other doctors also. They said that we had never seen this report as positive in our life. Everyone said that it might be difficult to conceive. Pray to God. Then someone suggested us to visit Dr. Seema Jain.\nMe and My Wife visited Dr. Seema Jain and produced all the reports to her. She took it in very cool manner. And said us that its not a problem at all. You don't worry. At that day, we found a new ray of hope after losing hopes. She treated and always cleared all of our doubts. She used to talk like a family member. She is very nice doctor and lady as well.\nWe blessed with a baby girl on 03rd August 2020. And this is possible only due to Dr. Seema Jain. My words are less to thank her. Thank you very much mam.\n",

Thereafter they missed out on informing us about different test details (telling theirs no fasting test then wasting our time while getting to know it is fasting test), not giving complete info, not taking care of applying stamp on ultrasound (again we had to take off another day from work bcoz they missed out on stamp and yet didn\u2019t accept their mistake. Her words were \u201cthat was your work, you should have remembered\u201d instead owning mistake. Dr seema missed on informing me about urine infection in my blood reports while I\u2019m supposed to trust her & relax, I had to be on my toes all the time. ******* **** ** ***** ** ***** *** ****** ****** **** ********* **** *** ***** ***** *** **** ******* ******** ** ****** **** ******** ** ******* **** **** ******* Also, after results came they didn\u2019t even bother to message or inform us about it.

Her whole team including Dr Ankita was truly appriciable. Her behaviour during that period was truly amazing as she answered all queries with utmost patience. We would like to thank her and her team from core of our heart.",
