That's what you need when you're expecting your first child and already have so many things going on in your head..you need a guide like Dr Yogita..to guide you well and support you throughout the beautiful experience called pregnancy!
Dr Yogita has delivered my sister's baby in the past so in my case she had to be the first choice. 
And I'm glad she was my doctor. 
Everything was going fab until I got to know that I have gestational sugar. I already shifted to Gurgaon so I went to nearby doctor. I don't want to demean and disrespect anyone but she was a horrible doctor. She scared me so much that I had tears in my eyes. 
I was already 8 months pregnant then. 
I was so tensed that I immediately went to Dr Yogita again. And thank god for her. She calmed me down..gave me the right knowledge and guidance..
And after seeing her I delivered my baby boy in 37th week..through the normal process. 
If it wasn't for dr Yogita I wouldn't have the courage to deliver my son normally. In this era of medical line being called a money making business there are doctors like Dr Yogita who make all the difference n respect their profession. 
Can never forget the amazing woman who gave me the biggest joy of my life !
