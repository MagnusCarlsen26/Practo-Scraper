The hygiene was not up to the mark, after the ultrasound they were petty about even giving tissue to clean up and they were literally using toilet roll, whats to save money in that..so the visit to Dr Verma costed me - consultancy 1200 ,full abdomen ultrasound 2500,tab Floreva 1300 -total Rs 5000...I found the whole experience very unfair....
",2022-08-30 15:11:56,False,False,Sandeep Pahwa,"Mr Sandeep,
Firstly you never visited our clinic in person. You have written the review for your relative which should not be done.
Something seemed very wrong about this review, so i consulted my staff and checked our security cameras. 
Patient was advised whole abdomen ultrasound and never forced to be done charges of which are displayed at reception. Fortis next door charges 3100.
 I am sorry to say but if you were smart enough to write a negative review, you also were smart enough to check the medicine prices in our clinic online  on phone where the 25% discount had a cap of 50 rupees.  For tissues in ultrasound room,those were not toilet paper rolls, they are tissue rolls. You can google them (Wonder Kitchen Tissue Rolls on Amazon). We're sorry but if you can't afford high quality service, there are a lot of cheaper services out there with a lot more than 25% discount and no cappings. Still better would be going to GOVT HOSPITAL where consultation, investigation like ultrasound and prescribed medicines will be given FREE OF COST to you. We always try to give a holistic service to our patients under one roof for convenience. Giving bad reviews because you are having a bad day is not very nice.  This is a clinic with over 20 years of operations where we value our patients and the distress they are in, for which they need to seek our help. And keeping these in mind, we offer value and quality under one roof to provide the best doctor-patient relationship to whoever visits us. We are always open to honest constructive criticism and we are always striving to improve. We hope you have a better experience elsewhere. Get well soon .",2022-09-03T09:08:55+0000,Dr. Rachna Verma
