"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"I was consulting a gynecologist and had 1 missed abortion and one 1 miscarriage and both time my gyne asked me to go for DNC which is a surgery to clean uterus which I didn't need beacause it could have done with medicines as  well.I was upset with my miscarriages and surgeries.So I visited Dr Mamta through  some recommendation and then I came to know that i didn't need surgery and it can be done medically.I was most scared of the surgery as miscarriage was a trauma and then surgery over it was more than a trauma.She also explained to me the reasons of miscarriages and told me not to go for unnecessary hormone injections which I used to take earlier when I hwas with other gyne.She not only educated me about my frequent miscarriages but also convinced me that my next pregnancy not necessarily will turn into miscarriages.
I feel while treating a patient , patient's psychological counselling is very important rather than just treating them like a robot who has no pain no  sentiments.
 She is not only thorough with her knowledge with her skill but she also understands that every patient is a human as well and should be respected.Her expertise is holostical approach towards a problem and that is why immediately gets connected to the patient.
I would strongly recommend Dr Mamta for all your gynecological concerns.",2019-08-02 06:41:06,False,True,Archana Raheem,,,

The issues faced by my wife post delivery were sorted to her satisfaction (which couldn't got resolved)  from previous Doctors.

I delivered my first baby girl under her guidance and supervision. I have been consulting her throughout my pregnancy and consider it the best decision I made. Since it’s my first pregnancy, I was very anxious and doubtful throughout. Though I always wanted to deliver my baby normally but due to the breach presentation, I had to opt for the C-section. She was very supportive in explaining everything in detail and clear all my doubts. 

I will continue to recommend her to my friends and family.
