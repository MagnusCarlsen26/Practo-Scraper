I'm delighted to share my heartfelt appreciation and write a glowing review for my extraordinary gynecologist, Dr. Pratibha Gupta, who guided me throughout my pregnancy, ultimately ensuring a successful and safe delivery of my precious child.

From the very beginning, Dr. Pratibha showcased a level of expertise and compassion that immediately put me at ease. Despite the numerous complications that arose during my pregnancy, her unwavering commitment and exceptional care provided confidence and trust in me. She possesses a remarkable ability to explain intricate medical concepts with clarity and patience, making sure I understood every aspect of my condition. This not only alleviated any anxieties but also empowered me to actively participate in decisions regarding my health and the well-being of my baby.

Throughout the entire journey, Dr. Pratibha's diligence and thoroughness in monitoring my progress were truly impressive. Each visit was characterized by meticulous examinations and a comprehensive assessment of my health. This attention to detail enabled early detection of potential issues, ensuring timely interventions and treatments, ultimately safeguarding the health of both me and my baby.

When I had unexpected complications, her quick thinking and decisive actions were nothing short of remarkable. Her expertise was invaluable during critical moments, creating an environment of stability and reassurance. I felt completely safe in her capable hands, knowing that my well-being and that of my baby were her top priorities.

Her knowledge and experience, resulted in a smooth and successful delivery and presence throughout the entire process provided immeasurable comfort and encouragement, allowing me to focus on the joyous arrival of my little one.

Not only she is an exemplary medical professional, but also an exceptional human being. Her kindness, empathy, and genuine care for her patients extend beyond the realm of medicine. She took the time to listen, understand, and address my emotional concerns, providing immense support throughout the journey.

I'm immensely grateful to have had Dr. Pratibha Gupta as my gynecologist during this pivotal period of my life.

",2017-07-31 06:02:33,False,False,Naresh,Congratulations Mr Naresh on having blessed with a healthy baby. I think you visited me some couple of months back and no doubt I diagnosed your wife having jaundice before having her admitted. As you said she had high jaundice... So to my understanding pregnancy with high jaundice is a high risk pregnancy which can cause damage to the developing baby as well  as mother and therefore mandates admission and monitoring. Hats off to your doctor who treated you without admission. I am happy that your  wife recovered from that episode of jaundice and delivered a healthy baby.  But you can never deny the complications associated with jaundice which by God's grace did not happen in your case. Anyways thanks that you made out time after so many months to give a feedback to me. Best wishes.... Dr Pratibha Gupta. ,2017-08-04T03:01:03+0000,Dr. Pratibha Gupta

I had to take an appointment with her as she was the only one available on a Sunday. But I would not recommend her to anyone. For me, it is very important that the doctor is a great listener to my health problems and should also be warm to the patients. She was not ready to listen to my problems and just wanted to get rid of me ASAP. She was as cold as ice and was pretty rude for a doctor. I tried to clear as many doubts as I could but she hardly gave me answers. I am never going back to her. I did because my doctor was not available on that Sunday. I have been lucky enough to have good and warm doctors to go to. This was an awful experience. 

P.S: A doctor needs to make his/her patient comfortable. It is really important for me at least.
