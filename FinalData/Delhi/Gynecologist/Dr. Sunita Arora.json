Infertility is a frustrating journey for every couple and walking into an IVF clinic can be a highly daunting experience. But after my first appointment with Dr Sunita l felt at ease which ensured my trust in her and her team\u2019s abilities. The IVF regiment is tough, complicated and has to be followed meticulously. However Dr Sunita and her team of doctors are extremely patient and guide you through the process over and over again. They keep a check on your progress throughout and keep your anxieties at bay while continuously ensuring you believe the fact that you will get pregnant! There is an uplifting quality about Dr Sunita that hugely effects your faith in the medicine and your body doing the work. I am extremely thankful and lucky to have been introduced to Dr Sunita at the right time in my journey by my gynaecologist Dr Loveleena Nadir. I highly recommend couples struggling with infertility to take an appointment with Dr Sunita Arora and make your miracles come to life! ",

Then some of our close friend recommended to consult with Dr. Sunita Arora- Obstetrician, Gynecologist, Infertility Specialist (La Femme, Fortis Hospital). We were very fortunate to have Dr. Sunita & her team. As we found that they were the most caring & supportive during treatment. Also, we have a personal touch with Dr. Sunita during treatment which is most required in case of infertility, as the patient would be going through very stressful life. With the strong efforts from Dr. Sunita we are now blessed with baby boy. We feel like the luckiest people in the world. Wishing Dr. Sunita to solve many more difficult cases like ours. Thanks to Dr. Sunita from bottom of our heart.",

She even explained small small things like in which side u should sleep.\nThere was some complications in my pregnancy but under her guidance, confidence I never bothered about those complications.

In the very first meeting, she convinced us for IVF as per my medical history and she was so humble that we built a faith on her. Finally, with her sincere supervision to my case, her constant attention at every step and her all time availability led to a positive result. She and her team are so well spoken, so smart and sincere to their work that they made the whole procedure totally comfortable for me. Since the first day, doctor made me believe that I am in safe hands. Thanks a ton for completing us by fulfilling our dream of having a family.\nArpita and Ashish",

Infertility is a frustrating journey for every couple and walking into an IVF clinic can be a highly daunting experience. But after my first appointment with Dr Sunita l felt at ease which ensured my trust in her and her team\u2019s abilities. The IVF regiment is tough, complicated and has to be followed meticulously. However Dr Sunita and her team of doctors are extremely patient and guide you through the process over and over again. They keep a check on your progress throughout and keep your anxieties at bay while continuously ensuring you believe the fact that you will get pregnant! There is an uplifting quality about Dr Sunita that hugely effects your faith in the medicine and your body doing the work. I am extremely thankful and lucky to have been introduced to Dr Sunita at the right time in my journey by my gynaecologist Dr Loveleena Nadir. I highly recommend couples struggling with infertility to take an appointment with Dr Sunita Arora and make your miracles come to life! ",

And, as per our Indian culture it is most important to have a child in our life. We were also facing infertility issues since last 10 years. Then some of our close friend recommended to consult with Dr. Sunita Arora- Obstetrician, Gynecologist, Infertility Specialist (La Femme, Fortis Hospital). We were very fortunate to have Dr. Sunita & her team. As we found that they were the most caring & supportive during treatment. Also, we have a personal touch with Dr. Sunita during treatment which is most required in case of infertility, as the patient would be going through very stressful life. With the strong efforts from Dr. Sunita we are now blessed with baby boy. We feel like the luckiest people in the world. Wishing Dr. Sunita to solve many more difficult cases like ours. Thanks to Dr. Sunita from bottom of our heart.",

After wandering here and there, following multiple treatments, our lap remained empty and also O was facing many health issues. Then, I got to know about Dr. Sunita Arora through one of my relatives. In the very first meeting, she convinced us for IVF as per my medical history and she was so humble that we built a faith on her. Finally, with her sincere supervision to my case, her constant attention at every step and her all time availability led to a positive result. She and her team are so well spoken, so smart and sincere to their work that they made the whole procedure totally comfortable for me. Since the first day, doctor made me believe that I am in safe hands. Thanks a ton for completing us by fulfilling our dream of having a family.\nArpita and Ashish",

She had resolved each and every query that we had which were never answered by any doctor in last 7-8yrs.\n\nShe is extremely caring and really dedicated towards her patients. Her positive attitude and encouraging nature, keeps her patients very calm and thats make the entire journey look very easy. Even her team has helped us in resolving every query, arranging nurse and medicine, etc during the toughest time of the year - second wave of Covid.\n\nI am highly thankful to Dr Sunita and her team for all their effective work, efforts, love and patience they have shown during the IVF treatment.\n\n*** ** *** **** ***",

With every step they took there was a rat of hope. She is frank to the point yet caring. She doesn't miss/ forget any detail of your case. Has a personal touch that way.\n\nWe were blessed with a baby girl in Jan 2020 due to her efforts. We wish her success in all her endeavours. May god bless her always.",
