None,None,0,0,YES,"I am the mother of Aditi Jain, who recently delivered a baby girl on 26th December in the hospital. She was under constant guidance of Dr.CS Mythreyi.

None,None,0,0,YES,I think I don‚Äôt know any better gynae than her. I have visited and consulted  a lot of doctors in the past but I could not find such a positive and heart warming doctor. I am glad I chose her for my pregnancy journey. She is a delight.. she made me and my husband so comfortable with the entire process. I don‚Äôt think I could enjoy my pregnancy and have a normal delivery if it was not her. She is very reasonable and does not recommend anything which is not required. I totally recommend her to every women who wants to enjoy their pregnancy and have a doctor like friend and mother.,2023-03-25 18:09:25,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

None,"Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,Dr CS Mythreyi has been of great help to us to sail through our pregnancy with ease and comfort despite we being under stress because of complications faced in previous pregnancy. She was confident of normal delivery (VBAC) even after our first child was born of caesarian for complications. She helped allay our anxiety as the D-Day was near and she did successfully conduct normal delivery this time. She has been such a blessing for us and would definitely recommend others to visit her.,2022-12-10 14:22:41,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
