It is rather sad that in the era of social media it is so easy to do mud slinging. Despite the risk of COVID to us doctors (remember, we are humans as well) I am seeing patients in emergency everyday and doing tele consults as well so that patients can get the treatment they need. I didn‚Äôt refuse you treatment. You got treatment from me a month ago over tele consult as well and that did work for you. The only thing I said was that to understand your problem you will have to make a visit and you will not be charged anything for that visit. By the way, to make that diagnosis USG is not sufficient and one has to do examination as well. But you refused to understand that at all.
