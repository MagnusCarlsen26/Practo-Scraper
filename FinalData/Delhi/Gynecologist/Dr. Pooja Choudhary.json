I approached her in  March\u201923 where after a blood test my pregnancy was confirmed. I was too anxious than happy because i was not prepared mentally for it, was overweight and also had ligament tear in my foot with constant swelling. She counselled me well, explaining how these issues were too little in comparison to the happiness that i was about to receive at the end of the journey, which motivated me to go ahead with my pregnancy.After visiting her for the first time, i was sure il be consulting her throughout my pregnancy.  I had a high risk pregnancy with my BP shooting up randomly. I was prescribed medicines as per requirement and was asked to monitor my Bp. Whenever i had any issues, i used to call or wtz app her, and trust me on this, SHE WAS ALWAYS AVAILABLE!!! no matter what hour of the day it was, she always replied! I had complete faith on her and followed whatever she prescribed. On 15th October, my Bp went too high with non stop vomiting.I called her and told her the same, she asked me to rush to the hospital immediately where I delivered a baby girl in her safe hands! Words will never be enough to express my gratitude to her, she is like a godly figure in my life. At a time when i did not trust myself, she gave me that faith and helped me constantly. I would highly recommend her to all those looking for a trustworthy gynaecologist! Thank you ma\u2019am.",

But i assured myself visit 2-3 doctors and choosing the one who judged my body less.\n\nWe booked an appointment on practo and finally the day came. I met her first with a feeling of terror in me thinking-she would ask why did i plan a baby before shedding some weight. But to my surprise she welcomed us with such a positive attitude and gesture that my first visit itself gave me such motivation towards being a plus size healthy mother\u2665 no judgments were made at all , which made me think positive and have a healthy pregnancy.\n\nAnd yes the decision of meeting 2-3 doctors and choosing one among them also strictly changed. This was indeed the first moment  i felt happy for my baby coming soon.\n\nShe has been a true blessing for me throughout this period pregnancy as well as post pregnancy, she was only a call away 24*7, every doubt and every query was answered very politely, anytime in the day or night. More than a doctor, she will be your mother, your elder sister, your friend. She trully has a golden heart.\n\nToday i can proudly say, i made the best choice that helped me go very smooth throught this tough phase of life.\n\nKudos to the best doctor in town....!!!!",

I read positive reviews about Dr Pooja online and decided to visit her. I am thankful i did because she is the best gynecologist i have ever consulted. Her softness and concern for her patients is such that as a first time mom i was made so comfortable and she gave me Atleast 30 minutes of time  per appointment explaining everything patiently. I asked her i wanted to have a normal delivery and she guided me very patiently . My babys weight was over the estimated weight that was shown on ultrasound. He was 3.7 kgs and had a tight loop of cord around his neck. I was induced at 38 weeks to increase my chances of normal delivery and with proper monitoring she was able to remove the cord within me before delivering the baby normally. It was incredible how she dealt with pressure with such diligence. And even in my post delivery appointments she feels like a family member who you can express and talk to about your concerns. I would genuinely recommend her to everyone who wants to be treated with great professionalism while at the same time having that friendly motherly care. \n100% recommend her for pregnancy and post pregnancy concerns.

As a parents we were worrying and past 6-7 month we never enjoyed our happiness due to thoughts of these complications. \n\nBut god saved us the day we went to decide on change of our Dr. and approached her by taking another risk of changing Dr. in last stages. When we went to visit her, we could feel her positivity. She is very patience , caring, and she knows very well how to console her patient .\n\nAlthough she was quiet far from our residence (almost 30 km) away, we felt the instant connection with her and decided to get the delivery done under her experience hands at Apollo Cradle Nehru Enclave. \n\nShe never asked for unnecessary tests/scans. She was always available for all my queries. She definitely has a personal touch with her patients. She was always positive in her approach and helped me steer through my pregnancy in a most convenient manner.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Pooja due to her pleasant, calm and supportive nature and Yes ofcouse her medical skills.\n\nThank you so much Dr. !",

It was after I took a video consultation from some other doctor, and I didn't feel relieved. The doctor prescribed me a similar dosage without even checking/analysing my stomach. When I told her that I have also done blood tests whose results are due this evening, she was completely against the idea of taking a look at them outside the consultation window. Infact she asked me to visit again from wherever I live to show the blood report physically. \nWe are living in a time where the whole world is constantly fighting its way against the consequences of pandemic.\nWitnessing doctors that are not humble to their patients and are focussed on their own time and money is truly disheartening. Even though I convinced her to have a look on just 2 pages of the whole report, I ended up not sending her my reports as I felt she was doing it out of compulsion. For someone who was adamant that there is no way she can take out the time to check the whole blood report, I felt that I cannot trust her for a reasonable look.  While I have huge respect for the work done by doctors, I feel that there is still a major shift required in many mindsets that are working for a crucial thing such as health.",

I went to almost 2-3 Drs for my treatment even in fortis and Max within 1 year, but Drs attitude was not good for my treatment they forced me to do Laprosopic and IUI in 2 months of treatment. I was really fed up with medicine, test and treatments. They didn\u2019t explain my problem and not listened carefully.\n\nAfter some time during 2nd lockdown almost all hospitals OPDs were shuts. Then I searched for the good Dr with good reviews in practo  and I finally made up, I found Dr Pooja Choudhary.\n\nShe helped me and explained various situations in diet, treatment, stress and my infertility problem. I told Dr that other Dr said to me Laprosopic and IUI treatments will be done, but Dr Pooja said wait for it these treatments are last option. She cured my problem with medicine only.\n\nAnd now glad to accounce that I am 4 months pregnant with the help of Dr.  Pooja. She is such a polite, listens problem very calmly, give solution and asks for no extra tests. She has a healing touch.\n\nThank you Dr for your support and motivation.\ud83e\udd17",

She would even counsel for your traditional family advise and explain in length. She is one person who\u2019d never hurry. We decided to blindly follow her advise through the nine months and we smooth. With one cord around the neck, and low baby weight also she managed to convince us for a normal delivery. We were ready for anything but she very confidently gave us hope and pulled off a successful vaginal delivery. \nWhat I feel as a patient in terms of motherhood, as it is my first baby, is that she understands and would inform you with needful information at the right stage and would not confuse you with over information. \nShe is very well coordinated with the ultrasound department simultaneously to monitor all tests and further the treatment. \nMy husband and I, like her presence and shall highly recommend Dr. Pooja Choudhary for her diligence and dedication towards her patients. My husband (an introvert) felt free to discuss our pregnancy queries with her and seek her advise all along. \nShe is the best doctor and a great human being. \nI still believe it is not what kind of delivery it happened. It is, How well we were informed all through by Dr Pooja Choudhary that was immensely helpful. ",

I approached her in  March\u201923 where after a blood test my pregnancy was confirmed. I was too anxious than happy because i was not prepared mentally for it, was overweight and also had ligament tear in my foot with constant swelling. She counselled me well, explaining how these issues were too little in comparison to the happiness that i was about to receive at the end of the journey, which motivated me to go ahead with my pregnancy.After visiting her for the first time, i was sure il be consulting her throughout my pregnancy.  I had a high risk pregnancy with my BP shooting up randomly. I was prescribed medicines as per requirement and was asked to monitor my Bp. Whenever i had any issues, i used to call or wtz app her, and trust me on this, SHE WAS ALWAYS AVAILABLE!!! no matter what hour of the day it was, she always replied! I had complete faith on her and followed whatever she prescribed. On 15th October, my Bp went too high with non stop vomiting.I called her and told her the same, she asked me to rush to the hospital immediately where I delivered a baby girl in her safe hands! Words will never be enough to express my gratitude to her, she is like a godly figure in my life. At a time when i did not trust myself, she gave me that faith and helped me constantly. I would highly recommend her to all those looking for a trustworthy gynaecologist! Thank you ma\u2019am.",

But i assured myself visit 2-3 doctors and choosing the one who judged my body less.\n\nWe booked an appointment on practo and finally the day came. I met her first with a feeling of terror in me thinking-she would ask why did i plan a baby before shedding some weight. But to my surprise she welcomed us with such a positive attitude and gesture that my first visit itself gave me such motivation towards being a plus size healthy mother\u2665 no judgments were made at all , which made me think positive and have a healthy pregnancy.\n\nAnd yes the decision of meeting 2-3 doctors and choosing one among them also strictly changed. This was indeed the first moment  i felt happy for my baby coming soon.\n\nShe has been a true blessing for me throughout this period pregnancy as well as post pregnancy, she was only a call away 24*7, every doubt and every query was answered very politely, anytime in the day or night. More than a doctor, she will be your mother, your elder sister, your friend. She trully has a golden heart.\n\nToday i can proudly say, i made the best choice that helped me go very smooth throught this tough phase of life.\n\nKudos to the best doctor in town....!!!!",

I read positive reviews about Dr Pooja online and decided to visit her. I am thankful i did because she is the best gynecologist i have ever consulted. Her softness and concern for her patients is such that as a first time mom i was made so comfortable and she gave me Atleast 30 minutes of time  per appointment explaining everything patiently. I asked her i wanted to have a normal delivery and she guided me very patiently . My babys weight was over the estimated weight that was shown on ultrasound. He was 3.7 kgs and had a tight loop of cord around his neck. I was induced at 38 weeks to increase my chances of normal delivery and with proper monitoring she was able to remove the cord within me before delivering the baby normally. It was incredible how she dealt with pressure with such diligence. And even in my post delivery appointments she feels like a family member who you can express and talk to about your concerns. I would genuinely recommend her to everyone who wants to be treated with great professionalism while at the same time having that friendly motherly care. \n100% recommend her for pregnancy and post pregnancy concerns.

According to our previous Gynecologist, this being my 2 nd baby at very late age, it was a high risk delivery (Chances of Pre mature delivery and so on). As a parents we were worrying and past 6-7 month we never enjoyed our happiness due to thoughts of these complications. \n\nBut god saved us the day we went to decide on change of our Dr. and approached her by taking another risk of changing Dr. in last stages. When we went to visit her, we could feel her positivity. She is very patience , caring, and she knows very well how to console her patient .\n\nAlthough she was quiet far from our residence (almost 30 km) away, we felt the instant connection with her and decided to get the delivery done under her experience hands at Apollo Cradle Nehru Enclave. \n\nShe never asked for unnecessary tests/scans. She was always available for all my queries. She definitely has a personal touch with her patients. She was always positive in her approach and helped me steer through my pregnancy in a most convenient manner.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Pooja due to her pleasant, calm and supportive nature and Yes ofcouse her medical skills.\n\nThank you so much Dr. !",

It was after I took a video consultation from some other doctor, and I didn't feel relieved. The doctor prescribed me a similar dosage without even checking/analysing my stomach. When I told her that I have also done blood tests whose results are due this evening, she was completely against the idea of taking a look at them outside the consultation window. Infact she asked me to visit again from wherever I live to show the blood report physically. \nWe are living in a time where the whole world is constantly fighting its way against the consequences of pandemic.\nWitnessing doctors that are not humble to their patients and are focussed on their own time and money is truly disheartening. Even though I convinced her to have a look on just 2 pages of the whole report, I ended up not sending her my reports as I felt she was doing it out of compulsion. For someone who was adamant that there is no way she can take out the time to check the whole blood report, I felt that I cannot trust her for a reasonable look.  While I have huge respect for the work done by doctors, I feel that there is still a major shift required in many mindsets that are working for a crucial thing such as health.",

I went to almost 2-3 Drs for my treatment even in fortis and Max within 1 year, but Drs attitude was not good for my treatment they forced me to do Laprosopic and IUI in 2 months of treatment. I was really fed up with medicine, test and treatments. They didn\u2019t explain my problem and not listened carefully.\n\nAfter some time during 2nd lockdown almost all hospitals OPDs were shuts. Then I searched for the good Dr with good reviews in practo  and I finally made up, I found Dr Pooja Choudhary.\n\nShe helped me and explained various situations in diet, treatment, stress and my infertility problem. I told Dr that other Dr said to me Laprosopic and IUI treatments will be done, but Dr Pooja said wait for it these treatments are last option. She cured my problem with medicine only.\n\nAnd now glad to accounce that I am 4 months pregnant with the help of Dr.  Pooja. She is such a polite, listens problem very calmly, give solution and asks for no extra tests. She has a healing touch.\n\nThank you Dr for your support and motivation.\ud83e\udd17",

She would even counsel for your traditional family advise and explain in length. She is one person who\u2019d never hurry. We decided to blindly follow her advise through the nine months and we smooth. With one cord around the neck, and low baby weight also she managed to convince us for a normal delivery. We were ready for anything but she very confidently gave us hope and pulled off a successful vaginal delivery. \nWhat I feel as a patient in terms of motherhood, as it is my first baby, is that she understands and would inform you with needful information at the right stage and would not confuse you with over information. \nShe is very well coordinated with the ultrasound department simultaneously to monitor all tests and further the treatment. \nMy husband and I, like her presence and shall highly recommend Dr. Pooja Choudhary for her diligence and dedication towards her patients. My husband (an introvert) felt free to discuss our pregnancy queries with her and seek her advise all along. \nShe is the best doctor and a great human being. \nI still believe it is not what kind of delivery it happened. It is, How well we were informed all through by Dr Pooja Choudhary that was immensely helpful. ",

She listens to you with genuine concern and compassion and takes time to understand your concerns, explain the issues and treatment. Also, she was always available to take your queries and questions and even reassure your family.

While those so called bigwigs treated us as yet another customer, Dr. Choudhary seemed to have understood the paranoia and anxiety of first time parents.She gave us as much time as we needed, and more. Not only did she answer all of our genuine (and silly) questions with utmost compassion and warmth, she was even very patient with my half a dozen relatives and addressed all their concerns as well. She was there for us every step of the way, so much so that down the line she started to feel like a family member.We are now proud parents of a happy and a healthy five month old son.I  highly recommend Dr. Choudhary and wish her luck in all her future endeavours.",

The way she explained us everything was awesome. She even explained us minute details which was necessary as a first time mom. Apart from being an awesome doctor, she is lovely human being. She walks extra mile with the patient and try to solve even the minute issues. She was available 24/7 over the call/ message.  My nine months  went like a cake walk and through out the journey doctor was super supportive. \nI heard that she gives her 100% for normal delivery. But in my case she gave her 200% for normal delivery and she encouraged me through out the process. And yes it happened and we welcomed our little angle to the world on 17th of February.\nI can say that choosing her as my doctor was the best decision. I highly recommend Dr. Pooja Choudhary.",

We found Dr. Pooja Chaudhary who was a consultant doctor at Apollo Cradle, Nehru place. We found her reviews online very positive. So we decided to visit her. From the day we took the 1st appointment till the time our baby girl was delivered, it was fully under the care of Dr. Pooja. She is very understanding, listens to all concerns, problems and advices very patiently. She is well experienced and knows how to handle even critical cases. Due to a lot of factors, ours was kind of High Risk Pregnancy. But due to her experience, knowledge and care, the delivery was very smooth and a beautiful daughter was born to us. Thanks to Dr. Pooja for making our maternity and delivery journey smooth, happy and memorable one.",

I went to her right in the 2nd month of my pregnancy and I must say, that was my best decision ever to be her patient!My whole pregnancy process was smooth and wonderful! I highly recommend Dr. Pooja Choudhary for all Mom-To-Be's :)",

It was peak covid 2nd wave. Not many gyne were ready to meet me in person but she did. After my reports came, she called me to her clinic and explained the diagnosis and what is to be done. Since then I have been constantly in touch with her, she has seen me when I was at emotionally low point. Even then she was so understanding and patient.She recently did my surgery on endometriosis and gallstone. When I decided to go for it, she made sure I find a good hospital under my budget knowing my problems. I am so grateful to her. ",

Dr. Pooja was my doctor throughout my pregnancy period. She was the one who encouraged me for normal delivery and was quite motivating. I had the problem of my baby becoming bigger in size during my last days.My diet was strictly controlled in the last few weeks so that baby size remains constant and I could give normal delivery. Date was decided and labour pain was induced. Dilation was monitored and labour pain progress was checked at regular intervals. Within 9 hours of labour pain , I had given birth to a healthy baby boy of 3.5kg via normal delivery.After giving birth , I was lying on bed with no pinch of pain at all . I was just wondering where has all the pain gone. It was all possible because of her sincere effort.My experience was really awesome. I would recommend everyone to go for Normal delivery and to take her guidance for smooth delivery.",
