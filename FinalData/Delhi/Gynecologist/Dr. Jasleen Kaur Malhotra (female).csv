We recently have our first baby and it was a wonderful experience with Dr. Jasleen Kaur during the pregnancy.

She is not just a skilled doctor but also incredibly friendly and professional. Her ability to explain things in a way we could understand made us feel confident and informed about the baby's & mother’s health.

In the beginning there were some slight complications but Mam made us relaxed and created a positive vibe to get through that time. 🙏🏻

Mam's commitment to her patients is outstanding. She took the time to listen to all our concerns during each visit and always provided clear explanations. 

She was available over Calls/Whatsapp anytime. Knowing we could reach out to her anytime made us feel secure throughout the pregnancy.

I appreciated her approach of recommending minimal medicines, promoting a more natural and healthy pregnancy.

Her team is also excellent, creating a positive environment during each visit. Also keep us communicated about the visits in advance.

I am grateful for the outstanding care she provided.

I salute the kind of experience, skill and patience you have in understanding/diagnosing the problem,  listening and resolving each query of your patient. Truly speaking, i have never met any doctor like you who is so skilled, good, kind and friendly. I had also seen her throughout my pregnancy last year and that was an amazing experience i had consulting her but due to some personal issues i couldn't get my delivery done through her and i guess that was my biggest mistake which I realised later when i got this infection. So, to all of those who are looking out for the best doctor in delhi i would request please visit Dr. Jasleen. *** ** *** *****",2021-04-28 07:17:49,False,True,Kusum Gaur,Thanks kusum for ur kind words.
