It was her remarkable experience and skill that could identify the potential complications that could have arisen and hence the delivery was planned at the right time.

We were referred to her around 24th week by Dr. Arvind Vaid to take our care during the last stages of pregnancy with plans of delivery at Apollo Cradle, Moti Nagar. Their guidance and professionalism have brought a miracle into our lives after 10 years of marriage when we had lost all hopes.

We were lucky to be in such good hands, Dr Pannam is not only courteous, affectionate, caring but not even for a single moment we ever felt we were interacting with someone who was not family for us. I still remember the first thing she mentioned ""in an exigency doesn't matter if it's 2 or 3am, don't hesitate just pick up the phone and call me"".

We used to msg her on WhatsApp knowing we will get a response asap. Despite her busy schedule we never faced any challenge in getting her attention. Even if she couldn't respond to the message there and then, she was always working in the background. In the hospital we texted her at the time of her OT, we didn't got a reply to our msg however we see 2 Dr's coming into our room sent by Dr Pannam from OT to check on the situation.
