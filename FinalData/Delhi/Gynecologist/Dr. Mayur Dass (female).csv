We reached out to her post an extensive online search on various online platforms and booked our first appointment during the first week of the 3rd trimester.

With complications such as RH negative pregnancy, Low lying placenta, Thyroid we reached out to her and we found out that she understood the issues and points which we wanted to highlight during our first meet.

She went through all the case history related documents and test reports thoroughly and suggested the way forward.

The suggestions and pro-active approach which she took during the last 2.5 months of pregnancy were completely exceptional.

During the last week of my delivery I even became Covid positive and my MRI report showed that there might be chances of Accreta/Inccreta for which she made sure that she had the entire team of doctors whose inputs might be required during my planned OT session.

She knows exactly how to treat and make sure you are fully satisfied!!!

Very supportive and experienced and not at all inclined towards money or gives test after test. 

We thank her from bottom of our heart for accepting our case.

She sometimes do scold you as an elder sister which is always welcome as we being a novice in this field so asking basic questions was acceptable since this was our 1st child and there is a different excitement in us and our family.

She is always supportive, polite and would clear your doubts patiently with no hurry of seeing more patients in queue .
