,"Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,Dr Sakshi.. words are not enough to thank her.. *** ** *** **** ************* * **** **** ***.. I was 49kg when I got pregnant and everyone told me that I will have a C-section delivery but trust me she was the only one who helped me throughout my pregnancy and prepared me for normal delivery. I had delivered my baby normally without any medicated relief procedure and I had her support throughout my pregnancy and also during labor . Apart from my mother she was the one on whom I relied completely.. I’ll blindly suggest her to everyone looking for a good gynaecologist in Delhi especially when you want to have a normal delivery. Dr Sakshi I owe you my normal delivery ♥️ and whenever God will bless me with second baby I shall come to you only no what in what corner of the world I will be ♥️♥️,2023-05-23 19:14:35,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

,,0,0,YES,"As my last visit with my wife to another doctor didn't go well, I was skeptical about this visit. But allow me to inform first that it has gone well as expected. She was very nice and polite to start the conversation. She heard our side of story, removed unnecessary medication and suggested what I was expecting. I confirmed everything from my family doctor (lucky to have a cousin playing this role for us) for second opinion. Recommending the doctor to everyone.",2022-07-14 13:09:00,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
