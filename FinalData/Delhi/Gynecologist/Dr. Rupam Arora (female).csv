None,"Pregnant,",0,0,NO,"Doctor initially was polite and understanding.
During the final week of pregnancy, she did not treat us well.
She refused to consult with us and made to sit on wooden bench even at time of high pain for almost an hour. When we left without consulting, she called us and asked to meet at clinic. She then immediately asked to go for ecg test. And based on those reports, she asked to get admitted.
My wife got admitted in max, patparganj and there the horor started. We were informed that it might require a surgery for the delivery even when all was well. When we decided to leave hospital and get admitted to some other, she came back immediately and after discussion with us, she did some thing which started labor pain.
Max is popular for doing surgery in 9/10 cases even when it is not needed.
We applied all that reference and threatened to leave hospital, it was a normal delivery.",2018-02-28 04:05:28,False,False,arav Gupta,,,
