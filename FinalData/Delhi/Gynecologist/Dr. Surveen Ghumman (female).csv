None,None,0,0,NO,"Cancelled the appointment and asked her to visit her the next day. 
Next day, we went to the hospital, she asked us to take a new appointment and cancel the existing one. 
Worse - She doesn't gets herself involved at all. Everything is to be done through the receptionist.
When we were trying to clarify, she didn't even listen to us, not even looked at us, not even at the receptionist. Just looked at the printout of our booking, made a face and then instructed the receptionist to tell us to re-do the booking.
Moreover, a staff person told us that she frequently reschedules her appointments unless she has ample patient on a day.
