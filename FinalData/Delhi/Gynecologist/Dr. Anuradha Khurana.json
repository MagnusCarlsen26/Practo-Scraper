That\u2019s when we found Dr Anuradha and we felt truly lucky for the turn of events. I personally like someone who can be direct and clear in their communication, particularly with a doctor who\u2019s going to guide me through growing and delivering my child. No unnecessary tests and overall it was a simple, straightforward experience- just what I like. I felt safe and comfortable in her care. I would definitely recommend her. :)",

Her calm behavior and positive spirt helped create a calm environment during this once in a lifetime event.\n\nI will always be thankful for the excellent care provided by Dr. Anuradha.\n\nThank you for making this experiences a wonderful one.

Moreover, my opinion is biased, surely, as I am comparing it with the other doctors I have consulted. \n\nYet, review is a review. Scope of improvement is always there.\n\nI believe her \"energetic\" manner is a bit more than required, as she needs to explain more, and respond less non-verbally. Her responses were close ended; nothing wrong, but as a clueless patient, she should be doing the talking, rather than waiting for me to ask questions. \n\nMeeting ended up being too brief, and about \"giving the talk and the medicines\". She did try to make the patient understand the state of affairs, and the course of whats ahead, but the manner was a bit hasty and transactional.  \n\nThus, -1",

I said yes and then she wrote tvs scan, took 500 or 600 as was mentioned on practo. She did not care to even listen to the issues.\n\nNext appointment was at motherhood, we went to see her after calling and reconfirming the same. She gave an abortion pill and changed about 1400. \nSince I was still having pain in the abdomen and that the doctor appointment was not fruitful, we booked another appointment with a very elderly *** **** doctor ** ** ***** ****** *** *** **** ******** *** ******* **** ****** ********** *** *************\nI would recommend not to visit this doctor.\n",
