She gave me so much confidence and was open to discussion for our prenatal/antenatal care and birth plan every step of the way. She motivated me for vaginal delivery which led to a very fast postpartum recovery for which I\u2019m forever grateful. Highly recommend the Doctor! There\u2019s no one like her! \u2764\ufe0f",

She took the time to listen to all our concerns during each visit and always provided clear explanations. \n\nShe was available over Calls/Whatsapp anytime. Knowing we could reach out to her anytime made us feel secure throughout the pregnancy.\n\nI appreciated her approach of recommending minimal medicines, promoting a more natural and healthy pregnancy.\n\nHer team is also excellent, creating a positive environment during each visit. Also keep us communicated about the visits in advance.\n\nI am grateful for the outstanding care she provided.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThank you, Mam, for ensuring the well-being of both my wife and my baby.  \u2764\ufe0f\n\nGratefully,\nProud Parents\n(Anushka & Rudra)",

She was kind and polite, hence, we continued with her for pregnancy and delivery.\n\nShe is friendly, straightforward and professional in her approach and is quite approachable, even when we couldn't reach her on the phone due to OPD hours she would always call back and resolve our queries. She guided and made delivery plan with us and always encouraged us to go for a natural birth. She patiently waited for about 16 hours when we tried to induce labour but when that didn't work she advised c-section and counselled us both about the pros and cons, she also fiercely clashed with the hospital authorities to get us into OT for the surgery at the earliest as it was an emergency and we didn't plan for a c-section.\n\nWhen things were not working in our favour, she made sure that we remain positive and worked around solution  . \nShe remained connected with us during labour, visited us in the hospital during wee hours pre and post delivery. We cannot thank her enough for her care and support.\n\nWe are forever grateful to Dr. Jasleen for bringing our beautiful daughter in to this world.",

In that crucial time we came across to Dr. Jasleen who listen our whole problem & call us same day to meet.I really appreciate that.\n\nDuring the 9 months span we asked many questions, called you many times(day & night) but almost every time you help us and you were always polite.

She is the most polite, calm and full of patience and humble doctor we have ever met in our life. Our pregnancy journey was very smooth and amazing with her. As a first time parents, we had numerous questions and She listens to all our issues and questions very patiently and guided us properly . We even contacted her during off hours and she was always available for us.  She always motivated us for the normal delivery and suggested all possible things to make this happen. She can go extra mile to help her patients in all possible ways. One of the special thing happened was that she was the only Dr in our hospital who stayed with us during last 4-5 hours of labour pain , ****** ***** ** *** **** **** ********** ** ***** **** *** **** *** she tried all her efforts for nomal delivery. But due to unavoidable reasons we went for c-sec but her efforts were commendable. We are blessed with beautiful baby girl. We are thankful and grateful to jasleen mam for making our journey memorable and smooth. I recommend  Dr Jasleen to all pregnant ladies *** *** ******* *** **** ****** ** ******Thanks to Dr Jasleen",

I am soo thankful to god that i have found her and got it diagnosed on time with her help otherwise it would have been a more serious problem. I had visited 2 different gynaecologists before Dr. Jasleen and nobody took the pain to dig deep into the matter that why the infection is popping up again and again on the stitches, they don't even bother to tell me the cause of infection. It had been 8 months that i was suffering from the pain before i consulted Jasleen ma'am. Thank you so so much ma'am for immediately getting all my tests done and suggesting the proper treatment for it. I salute the kind of experience, skill and patience you have in understanding/diagnosing the problem,  listening and resolving each query of your patient. Truly speaking, i have never met any doctor like you who is so skilled, good, kind and friendly. I had also seen her throughout my pregnancy last year and that was an amazing experience i had consulting her but due to some personal issues i couldn't get my delivery done through her and i guess that was my biggest mistake which I realised later when i got this infection. So, to all of those who are looking out for the best doctor in delhi i would request please visit Dr. Jasleen. *** ** *** *****",

During lockdown due COVID-19, she ensured and kept personal touch whenever required, she made herself available on calls / msgs whenever I had any concerns, her clinic is always very well maintained with good cleanliness and hygiene. The medicines, diet and test prescribed by her suited me very well throughout the pregnancy, the hospital Aakash Healthcare suggested by her was one of the  best with the services and hygiene levels. With God's grace and utmost care taken by Dr Jasleen I delivered a healthy baby, her post pregnancy guidance has helped me to maintain good health for myself. * *** *********** *** *** ** *** **** ****** *** I was lucky to be in safe hands.

My pregnancy was the most precious one because it happened to me after a long wait of 8 years. After struggling for so many years & going under knife more than couple of times, failed pregnancy attempts, I lost all hopes. Then I came to Dr. Kaur after taking treatments from various other gynaecologists. After meeting her for the first time I realised that I am in better hands now. She patiently, dexterously and very carefully managed my whole pregnancy... being the most panicking and petrified mom-to-be, I used to call her at any odd hour over the tiniest thing and she was kind enough to receive my calls and put me at ease. In case she missed my calls, she would call back soon after. She never ever showed any signs of ignorance and that's the best thing about her. She is equally concerned about her patients. She never felt me like a patient and treated me almost like a younger sister. I am a mother of a beautiful daughter now and all thanks to her. My husband gives all credit to her and for him she was no lesser than a god. Without having a second thought, I would recommend all ladies to approach her and talk to her and you 'll feel her caring and warm welcome..\n\nGood Luck !!",

I really like one thing about doctor that she only recommends medicines when it\u2019s really necessary and  for the whole 9 months she treated me with very minimal medicines (only Iron, Cal, Vit, etc\u2026). Really Appreciate doctor\u2019s moral support and positive attitude while delivering. She encouraged me through the whole process as we have decided to go with normal delivery process.

She is very polite, humble and took care of me during the pregnancy and even after delivery. I had High Blood pressure during the end months of my pregnancy and she told all the red flags to me before hand so that I can be cautious and we could treat it on time. She gave me trial for normal vaginal delivery but due to high bp I had to be admitted before time i.e. 37 weeks in emergency and it wasn't possible, so I had to go with C Section. During C section she was very supportive and helped me calm down. After delivery my BP was still high 160/100 , which was not normal but she took extra care of me, stayed connected with me to track and treat it. Because of her - me and my Son are well. I couldn't have trusted or chosen any other doctor over her. Would always recommend her. Thank you Dr. Jasleen for everything you did! \u263a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udf38",

Infact we would even call her sometimes when we had certain issues and she always responded back. She would provide complete clarity and detail explanation for each ultrasound report. During each consultation ample time was given by her even if there were many patients in waiting. Timely suggestions and treatment from her resulted in NVD of my healthy baby girl.

She would talk you and explain everything you are concerned about & would make you more comfortable in every visit. I used to be happy and relaxed after leaving her clinic that everything is fine in every visit. Definately she is not mon e y min d e d as many doctors do instead she asked us to have your recommended test from anywhere not from  the particular one.\nI was not able to bear pain and was thinking of cesarean but Jasleen mam literally tried her best and finally I delivered normal.\n\nWe thank guruji who blessed us a nice doctor and thank you so much mam for watching mine and baby's health and giving us the healthy baby.\n",

I have never seen a Dr so polite, thorough and friendly and these characteristics are more important when you are in high risk pregnancy.. Thank you Dr Jasleen for being more than a Dr for us.. A real guardian and fabulous person... We as a family of  4 now would always be grateful to you ... ",

All through my stay she visited twice a day to get the updates on my health. Even after operation she guided me throughout for my health related issues\nI am thankful to her for making my pregnancy and post partum journey beautiful.\n\nShe is a great gynaecologist because of the following reasons:\n1. She would listen to all your concerns and clear them very patiently\nI used to make a list of questions and ask her in my routine visits - she always answered my queries and cleared my doubts\n2. She would explain all the issues in detail\nI got the issue of cholastasis towards the end of my pregnancy so she suggested two weeks early delivery \n3. She will not get the unnecessary tests done\nI got all my routine ultrasounds done- no extra xrays ultrasounds or blood tests were prescribed\n4. She is very approachable - in person and on calls\nI used to visit her routinely in the gap of one month and all my visits were very fruitful and if i had doubts or any concerns in between the visits i used to call her and discuss.\n\nThanks Doctor Jasleen for your guidance \ud83d\ude0a",

She has been great throughout my pregnancy be it about sharing the details about each and every minor thing. She was always available over call and would call back if not able to take the call. She would give you adequate time for your concerns and would not rush for anything, I can go on and on for her. She never suggested any unnecessary tests or medicines and would seek your reports thoroughly and then will give you the right advise. The explanations given during the entire journey has been tremendous. And the she was always in favour of normal delivery and did the same.  I m blessed with a healthy and beautiful daughter and all my post delivery concerns are also going ahead with her. My husband and I are thruly thankful to her for all efforts s and time given by her during pregnancy. She is my go to doctor for all concerns And would definitely recommend her to everyone seeking gynaecologist. ",

But as soon as she saw the test result, she said it may be ectopic! She helped me to detect the ectopic pregnancy very early which saved my life or avoided a surgical situation.\n\nI am very thankful for her very systematic approach of diagnostic and perfectly managing my life threatening situation.

She made sure everything went smoothly with regular follow-ups and also being available on phone/whatsapp when needed, she also answered our naive questions patiently for us to-be-first-time-parents :). When pains started we simply followed her advice because I knew my wife couldn't be in more safe hands. The doctor came to the hospital at 3am in the night for delivery and also expertly handled some complication at that odd hour, I am so thankful for that. Dr Jasleen had been encouraging my wife to go for a normal delivery and it was indeed a successful normal delivery!\n\nI have never seen a medical professional in my life with such a perfect blend of experience, skills, warmth, patience and dedication towards her work. My wife is usually nervous around hospitals and doctors, but with Dr Jasleen she developed a friendly bond and that speaks volumes about her caring nature towards her patients and making them feel comfortable. I would strongly recommend Dr Jasleen to my friends/family because she is a thorough professional and a very nice person.",

No use of taking a appointment if someone who take appointment of late time and come before time they send them in first and the person who came on time have to wait for 40-50 mins. After seeing the dr. i paid fees and asked will i be charged for showing test reports next time they said no this fees include that. Due to some reasons i came after 8-9 days with reports then they asked me to pay fees. according to them this report session only applicable for 5 days. so why the receptionist didn't mention when i asked her about the reports. is this the way to charge extra fees from patients.",
