I started my journey with Dr. Vaishali when I was 5 month pregnant. By that time, I was exhausted with leading gynaecology specialist and their below standard Gujarat specific practise (i.e. I called it “file practise”). My pregnancy was progressing in healthy manner with no symptoms of any complications.

Before Dr. Vaishali Sharma, my previous  gynaecologist was from Kuwait and her opinion was exactly the same that pregnancy was healthy without any implications of age.

Contrary to above, all the doctors I consulted in Gujarat before Dr. Vaishali were looking at my age as sole indictor to book C-section dates months in advance and planning to inject me with different steroids without any reason or risky symptoms. This was shocking for me at the same time created doubts about my previous gynaecologist’s opinion. There was time, when I was almost persuaded into “file practise”. But to convince myself, I kept searching for gynaecology specialist and Dr. Vaishali was my last hope before I surrender to “file practise”.
“File practise” is coined for treatment system in Gujarat where a file is opened, once pregnant woman visits doctor for first time. And this patient specific file is pre-filled with boxes of appointment, vaccines, injectables, sonograms, supplements, etc. which each patient needs to take regardless of their health condition & body-requirements. It transformed pregnancy to a manufacturing process than an experience of life. And because pregnancy is treated like illness, unwanted medication gives you short term and long term side-effects.

During my first visit, my first question to Dr. Vaishali Sharma was how will I deliver baby, normal way or c-section. And her answer with extreme confidence was, we can’t decide anything now dear. Let’s focus on your health and baby health now; and this was very assuring for me. And she does not follow “file practise”. For her, every patient is unique.

From 5th month to 9th month, I was visiting her as when needed  and she was able to check my progress just by examination. Even the sonographic scan was only conducted few times in five months. In terms of vaccination during pregnancy, I tool only 1 during initial times and other towards delivery. In medication, I was only taking vitamins supplements as per the need. In daily food, I was taking all available fruits, vegetables, coconut water and home cooked food. 

During final weeks, I was visiting her once a week. And when contraction started, we waited for just a day to see the progress. And based on examination and sonography results, she asked me to admit to KD hospital and next day afternoon, I was blessed with angel in my lap. And it was normal delivery at the age of 36. and while I am writing this review, I am back to normal life in just two weeks from delivery date.

Overall, Dr. Vaishali Sharma’s practise is of international standard, simple, convenient and trustworthy. Compared to “Gujarat’s file practise”, I was asked to visiting her when needed. Sonography was conducted only when it’s necessary. I was not given any steroids or extra injectables or unnecessary vaccines. And she was reachable by call or message if you see any alarming symptoms.

Practise like above may look very uncaring in Gujarat but in reality, this is an international practise followed by United states and European countries. 

Motherhood should not be deemed as  sickness or illness but it’s a beautiful journey of life. It should be cherished with happy moments and your gynaecologist is a companion who guides you throughout the journey. Pregnancy is not to manufacture a baby but it’s a journey of life to get blessings of god in the form of an angel.

I hope this feedback helps proactive mothers making choice about gynaecologist.

Dr. VAISHALI SHARMA is the most amazing Gynaecologist, with her friendly and thoughtful approach, vast knowledge and great dedication towards work. 

I strongly recommend her for any infertility related treatment. The reason behind strong recommendation is that, we are trying to conceive from last 7 years but we didn't get any success. We visited almost all the top Gynaecologist of Delhi NCR, but with no luck. Then we met Dr Vaishali sharma via some known source. She politely explained all treatment in details, gave us plenty of time to speak about our problem and counsel us to get a resolution. And fortunately with her efforts & experience, we are blessed with baby boy dated 1st Nov 2021.
During our entire journey, she make us feel relaxed and calm even in the painful & critical circumstances. She possess great qualities which includes:
1. Not a money -She always emphasize the important tests only.. After checking scan reports she advise us that the triple marker, quarter marker tests etc. not required... Also during start of our journey she reviewed all blood test reports which are 3 months old & doesn't recommend us to undergone all test again.
2. To the point approach: During start to end of our journey she explained each & everything clearly with a very transparent approach... 
3. Personal touch: She is a great human being who is having a caring approach towards patient.. Always available on whats app/ call. Have you hear any doctor who is spending time in consoling patient when they are crying. She possess such a great attitude. 
I request to all who are thinking to conceive and not getting success, take appointment of Dr. VAISHALI SHARMA. With God grace you may also got success. 

In the last I just want to say that We have never met a God, but after meeting her we realize that Messenger of God do exists. Thanks Dr VAISHALI for the wonderful gift you have given to us.",2021-11-12 16:41:21,False,True,Mrs.HIMANI CHhABRA,,,

Not only she was truly amazing with the whole surgery process but she addresses all your queries and doubts with full patience.

She is really great human being with her great experience. She explained us all treatments in details with each phase. And fortunately with her efforts and experience, we got success in first cycle of IVF and after successful 9months, we blessed with a cute and healthy BABY BOY with 3kg weight.
During process, we learnt along with process that we as patient should keep a lot of patience through out process till end and result.
