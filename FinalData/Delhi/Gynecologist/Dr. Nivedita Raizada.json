It was last year since our pregnancy journey started where we were not sure how things will go. But it is because of Dr. Nivedita we both were able to cross all hurdles and able to deliver our first baby. She is God's person whom I have never seen irritated or angry. She is so calm and composed that it become very easy for us to communicate anything and ask any doubt. For me I have feeling of family with her and I think her every patient would feel the same. Eveyone in my family also feels the same. I would like to Thanks Dr. Nivedita for all her guidance, support , treament, encouragement and last but not the least normal delivery of our baby. Our baby is also lucky that she got her first physical touch in the world with Dr. Nivedita and we wish our baby will also have that positive energy from her. Thank you once again Dr. Nivedita Raizada.",

She is beyond exceptional in several ways and would highly recommend her to everyone. \n\nHer knowledge, experience and overall excellency at work, was quite apparent from our very first visit to the clinic, and we developed complete trust in her from then on - I remember telling my husband on our way back from our first visit, that with her, I feel fully assured that everything will be taken care of and I can completely rely on her. \n\nOn our monthly visits to her through the pregnancy, she always gave us ample time to explain everything in detail and answer all our questions. It was simply amazing how without us having to say much, she was perceptive of our preferences and needs and always seamlessly factored those in her advice to us. Also, it was extremely heartening and almost unbelievable to see that, despite running on such tight schedule and meeting several patients in a day, she remembered the tiniest details about us from our earlier visits, including even the most mundane things like my plans of visiting parents or where they stay - these small things made it apparent how much she cared personally, something that\u2019s so very precious and rare to find in these times. \n\nDr. Nivedita\u2019s approach of advising on holistic wellness, including all-natural methods such as stressing on walking, exercises, improving dietary intake and closely monitoring weight gain really helped us in eventually being able to have a normal delivery. On the date of delivery, we reached out to her quite early in the morning and she immediately guided us on next steps and personally ensured the coordination with hospital for an extremely smooth admission, despite the additional formalities required due to covid. Dr. Nivedita arrived well in time and stayed with us throughout the long labour. She kept encouraging and guiding me with expertise all along. It was only her presence and calming voice, that helped me bear the killing labour pains - it simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible without her!\n\nApart from her medical excellency, the genuineness of her personality and the personal love and care with which she guided us, is something that I haven\u2019t experienced with any other doctor before. And so, especially in this most important event of our lives, my husband and I feel extremely blessed to have come to know of her and to have been under her guidance. \n\nIf you are looking for a highly experienced gynaecologist who will care and be concerned for you just as family \u2013 she is the one to go to!\n\nMay God always bless her and her family.

But it is because of Dr. Nivedita we both were able to cross all hurdles and able to deliver our first baby. She is God's person whom I have never seen irritated or angry. She is so calm and composed that it become very easy for us to communicate anything and ask any doubt. For me I have feeling of family with her and I think her every patient would feel the same. Eveyone in my family also feels the same. I would like to Thanks Dr. Nivedita for all her guidance, support , treament, encouragement and last but not the least normal delivery of our baby. Our baby is also lucky that she got her first physical touch in the world with Dr. Nivedita and we wish our baby will also have that positive energy from her. Thank you once again Dr. Nivedita Raizada.",

She is beyond exceptional in several ways and would highly recommend her to everyone. \n\nHer knowledge, experience and overall excellency at work, was quite apparent from our very first visit to the clinic, and we developed complete trust in her from then on - I remember telling my husband on our way back from our first visit, that with her, I feel fully assured that everything will be taken care of and I can completely rely on her. \n\nOn our monthly visits to her through the pregnancy, she always gave us ample time to explain everything in detail and answer all our questions. It was simply amazing how without us having to say much, she was perceptive of our preferences and needs and always seamlessly factored those in her advice to us. Also, it was extremely heartening and almost unbelievable to see that, despite running on such tight schedule and meeting several patients in a day, she remembered the tiniest details about us from our earlier visits, including even the most mundane things like my plans of visiting parents or where they stay - these small things made it apparent how much she cared personally, something that\u2019s so very precious and rare to find in these times. \n\nDr. Nivedita\u2019s approach of advising on holistic wellness, including all-natural methods such as stressing on walking, exercises, improving dietary intake and closely monitoring weight gain really helped us in eventually being able to have a normal delivery. On the date of delivery, we reached out to her quite early in the morning and she immediately guided us on next steps and personally ensured the coordination with hospital for an extremely smooth admission, despite the additional formalities required due to covid. Dr. Nivedita arrived well in time and stayed with us throughout the long labour. She kept encouraging and guiding me with expertise all along. It was only her presence and calming voice, that helped me bear the killing labour pains - it simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible without her!\n\nApart from her medical excellency, the genuineness of her personality and the personal love and care with which she guided us, is something that I haven\u2019t experienced with any other doctor before. And so, especially in this most important event of our lives, my husband and I feel extremely blessed to have come to know of her and to have been under her guidance. \n\nIf you are looking for a highly experienced gynaecologist who will care and be concerned for you just as family \u2013 she is the one to go to!\n\nMay God always bless her and her family.

I never ever met such a polite and generous doctor in my life before, we are so lucky that we could find her. This was our first pregnancy so we were quite nervous before meeting her. she guided us so well, and explained everything at our first appointment. She was very careful since we had our first appointment and would never delay to call/ WhatsApp to answer back also updates you if you have an appointment and she is getting late. She is very much committed and honest to her profession. She is very patient, soft spoken and full of humanity. She is also having friendly nature which makes you comforatable.\nShe practiced in *** **** ********* ** *****(Fortis Hopital, Rainbow Children Hospital, Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research) and she has great experience of normal delivery. She encourages and prepares her patients for a normal delivery.\n\nShe helped us in making a activity and diet plan of having a healthy and happy baby. She told us to be happy, active, stick with healthy diet, avoid outside food and go for long walks daily, also encourage us to go for vacation after 3 months of pregnancy for a change. We never faced any complications during our pregnancy under the guidance of Nivedita Ma'am and delivered a happy, healthy and a cute baby boy:-) @ Rainbow Hospital Malviya Nagar on 12th May 2020. My wife asked for Caesarean Section in the labour room as she was unable to bear the pain, but Nivedita Ma'am asked me to motivate her for normal delivery, when we finally decided for Caesarean Section, Nivedita Ma'am still told me that she will try once again for normal delivery in operation theater. So you can understand how much efforts she puts for normal delivery. She made our entire pregnancy journey a very delightful and memorable experience for us. We highly recommened Dr. Nivedita Ma'am. \n\nlast but not least, we had our delivery during the Lockdown period due to Covid-19. We were quite tensed how the delivery will be handled during the lockdown. She guided us so well and supported during this tough time, she also helped us making a plan to cope up with the lockdown situtaion, and made our delivery successfull @ Rainbow Hospital. We would be grateful to her thorughout our life for giving us so precious gift of life and priviledged us to be a mother and a father, this feeling is different from any other feelings of this world. It got only got possible under the guidandace of Dr. Nivedita Ma'am. We thank from the depth of our heart and salute for her selfless services to the humanity. \n",

Heard about her from one of my relative, and I contacted her as soon as I got to know about my pregnancy. \nSince my first visit she encouraged for normal delivery. Honestly I never thought about having a normal delivery as I considered it an impossible task. But she made it sound possible.\nMy entire pregnancy journey turned out utterly beautiful and extremely smooth under her guidance. However, at the starting of my 36th week I started to have some issues and it looked like I might have to deliver prematurely. Still Dr Nivedita didnt give up and after the checkups, ultrasound, tests she assured my that we can wait. Almost every day she texted me about my health and baby movement. Personally I dont think any doctor would do that, but she is more than just a doctor I believe.\nTill my last phase she urged for exercise and walking, and I did that. In my 40th week when I experience my water breaking early at 4 am, i immediately called her and as usual she was too quick to respond. She asked me to reach the hospital and she made all the arrangements for me over the call at the hospital. \nAt 6.30 she induced, contractions started and the pain was unbearable. I req her to give me a pain killer but she motivated me to bear the pain as having a pain killer could increase the labour duration. \nI was in labour for 4 hours and exactly at 10.20 in the morning I delivered a healthy boy. \nI still cant believe that a person like me had a normal delivery, that too i delivered in just 4 hours, which is next to impossible. \nThis is what dr. nivedita is, making imposible possible.\nHer support has been a blessing truly. It has been 21 days since I delivered and I feel blissful as I did not have stitches on my tummy. I am just so thankful to her. Had it been any other doctor, I would have faced a c section for sure. \nDuring my labour she constantly motivated me to breathe deep and be calm. \nDr nivedita's patience for normal delivery, experience and her talent is what blows our mind. Her polite nature and soft spoken personality is an add on. Whenever I had a query I would drop a msg to her and she quickly used to reply my messages. \nWhat a wonderful doctor she is. We are lucky we found her and a big thanks to our relative who suggested her.",

Being absolutely new to this, we needed a Doctor who would be willing to patiently guide us through this wonderful journey of bringing our Baby into this world. After speaking in multiple circles, reading reviews online and consulting with family doctors, we settled to consult with Dr. Nivedita Raizada. From the very first visit, till the day our Baby Boy was born, Dr. Nivedita became a source of guidance, strength and encouragement for us. Needless to say, all the wonderful things you will read in reviews are quite true. Below are insights of our experience that I am sure will help you make the right choice:\u2022 Dr. Nivedita was extremely kind and patient, throught our scheduled consultations and even some unplanned ones, she encouraged us to ask more questions and detailed every explanation for us. No visit ever felt rushed or hurried, we always left happy and content. \u2022 Focused on Healthy and Natural nutrition for the growth of a happy and healthy baby. Dr. Nivedita was instrumental in maintaining a good diet and excercise routine that helped us eventually have a smooth and quick normal delivery.\u2022 Dr. Nivedita Raizada, has one of the most impeccable bedside manner we have ever come across. During emergency / false emergencies in our pregnancy, her knowledgeable and reassuring advice gave us strength and hope to continue with pursuing a natural delivery. By her gentle and reassuring manner, she gave us strength to face all challenges and she was with us throughout these challenges, every step of the way.\u2022 As first time parents, we had many questions at different times and Dr. Nivedita was very prompt, supporting us with information and advice when ever we needed it. We never ever felt our queries were not important but rather got more information to help us prepare even better. We can simply conclude by saying, Dr. Nivedita has been a pivotal part of our pregnancy and delivery. She walked with us hand in hand and for us there could not have been a better Mentor, Counselor and Friend for this journey. ",

She is very passionate about her work, and is always available for her patients for even very small queries.\nAll my appointments with dr. Nivedita were conducted at the puri clinic throughout my pregnancy tenure where they followed all covid protocols. She is so friendly, caring, supportive and humble. She tries to explain the problem in detail to her patients. Another best quality of her is, she is always available on phone, even on whatsapp for her patients.One can literally discuss all the problems with her anytime. The way she manages her time for patients and put  in efforts, is really commendable. HATS off to her. \nShe was so committed towards me as her patient that she was with me throughout my labor time , she monitored me and my baby very closely . At last she took the right decision of Cesearian as my baby heart beat was dropping drastically and it was very risky scenario. I was very fortunate that my baby boy was delivered by her safe and healthy.\nI would also like to add here that she guided me really well during my pregnancy time for diet and exercises , as a consequence of which my body became very strong to cope up with the repercussions of Cesearian and at the same time I became ready to take all the responsibilities of my new born. \nMe and my family are very thankful to her and will always be grateful to Dr. NIVEDITA for such an amazing experience.",

However, Dr Raizada gave complete time in each telephonic conversation and addressed all our concerns. Since beginning she stressed on normal delivery and counseled me really well for the same. She prescribed me healthy diet to follow for appropriate weight gain and exercises that could increase the chances of having normal delivery. Eventually I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl through normal delivery on January 28. The entire process of delivery was very well managed by Dr Raizada. She remained with us on phone constantly when pains were induced and informed us of treatment at each and every step. Since my water broke in the morning on Jan 28, there were chances of baby undergoing stress, yet Dr Raizada constantly monitored baby's condition and left on stone unturned to ensure normal delivery. We are glad that we met her for our pregnancy check up. Having delivery done by her was one of the best decisions that we took. She is an extremely calm and understanding medical professional who not only treats her patients well but also respects them, listens to them and address all of their queries. In her clinic, she gives adequate time during every visit. It is very rare to find such doctors these days who keep patients and their feelings central to the treatment process. We would recommend her to anyone looking for good obstetrician and gynaecologist. ",

I was very negative and used to think that I won't be able to undergo this process of pregnancy and bearing a child. I searched a lot for a good doctor. Finally I got to know about her from a cousin who is also a very good doctor.  Doctor Nivedita is next to God for us. I have not seen a doctor before who is so much ethical and committed towards  her profession. She made this entire journey a very delightful experience for us. She had always answered even my silliest doubts. She is very patient and soft spoken. Will explain everything very nicely and in layman terms to her patients. Right from the beginning she was very careful and cautious and would never delay to call/ WhatsApp back to answer me ( you will  rarely find doctors doing this ) She helped me in setting  my proritiy  (of having a healthy and happy baby) over anything else. She told me to be active, happy and go for walks daily . That's why I never faced any complications in my pregnancy and ended up delivering a healthy and really a happy baby :). She has education and  experience from one of the premier institutes of India. The treatment is advanced and she will not put you on pills unless it is necessary. She would encourage and prepare her patients for a normal delivery . I have heard of many doctors suggesting ceasarian even under normal cases to earn money.   I was lucky to find her. Me and my husband are very grateful to her",

However, post the wonderful, and second to none experience - we had with Dr. Nivedita - we are writing our first feedback :)\n\nOut of the innumerable qualities of Dr. Nivedita, we would like to highlight the four most important traits which helped us in the path towards our little angel. These were:\n\n1. Shared concern\nWhile the experience for a family during pregnancy is probably unique, Dr. Nivedita becomes part of your beautiful journey. You are no longer left to yourself and you have \"The Expert\" always by your side who is equally concerned in ensuring that everything is alright.   \n\n2. Valuing and prioritizing 'You'\nThere would be a lot of situations when you would like to be heard fully, when you would like someone to understand you fully, when you would like someone to accord high priority to you and when you would like someone to help you do what is right for you - in all such situations, you would always find Dr. Nivedita by your side. \n\n3. Expertise   \nNo two doubts about her expertise in her area. While her credentials speak for themselves, our experience with her suggests that you can fully trust her with her expert, tailor-made and well-calibrated advise. \n\n4. Great Human Being\nThroughout the pregnancy, we witnessed and silently observed her while dealing with her subordinates/nursing staff/lady helping her manage the reception and were surprised how respectful she was towards them. While this is a desirable trait and everybody is expected to be respectful of others, in today's world the count of such human beings is a handful. \n\nWe would strongly recommend Dr. Nivedita if you are looking for consultation in her area of expertise :)  ",

Though my first delivery was a cesarean, but doctor from the very beginning was in favor of a normal delivery.  In each visit doctor was very patient in listening to each and every query and question and provided ample amount of time with details around every query I had.   Doctor has been extremely friendly and empathetic from day one.  She does not believe is too much medication but rather focuses more on the basics which are required for a healthy pregnancy.  She treats every patient as a separate individual and adjusts her approach to suit individual needs, which is highly appreciable and shows a very positive approach from a doctor which puts one at ease.\n\nDuring my delivery, doctor kept me motivated for a normal delivery and was with me throughout my labor period.  Her presence made me confident to be able to go through the pain.  My labor period went little too long and while any other doctor would have given up, she kept me motivated to keep trying.  Unfortunately, I went through a C-sec even after waiting for long.  However, knowing that doctor really helped and tried for a normal delivery with me really shows the commitment of the doctor towards the patients.\n\nMy experience with Dr. Nivedita has been highly positive and has infact changed my outlook towards doctors.  I would any day highly recommend Dr. Nivedita to everyone.  She can be approached for any issues with confidence that we are in safe hands and along with a highly qualified doctor, we will get a friend a talk to.",

This time around I got the news of my pregnancy during the lockdown, since no clinics were open nor were any OPD's working I decided to contact Dr.Nivedita whose clinic I saw in my apartment campus. I took her details from her husband Dr. Anurag Puri who we had visited for a consultation sometime ago. \n\nWhen I connected with Dr. Nivedita and shared with her my past 2 pregnancy experiences she immediately got into action and assured me that she understands how precious this pregnancy was and she will ensure the baby gets into my hands. \n\nThe pregnancy progressed and my faith in Dr. Nivedita kept increasing with every interaction that I had with her. She kept our physical interactions minimum considering the covid times and also was prompt in answering all my whatsapp messages even if it were late evenings or early mornings. Talking to her always helped me keep my anxiety in place and helped me sail through my pregnancy without any family support.\nAs we proceeded, I developed pregnancy induced hypertension in my 8th month. Dr. Nivedita chalked out a plan where I was to monitor my BP multiple times a day and the same needed to be shared with her,this helped her take quick decisions on my medical condition by changing or altering medicines accordingly. As we were about to complete 36 weeks and enter 37 weeks I realised that my BP was going extremely out of control and I started sending updates to Dr. Every two hours, she personally coordinated my hospital visits for getting NST's done and was in touch with the Dr's at Fortis to ensure my reports were well understood and monitored. \nThe evening of Diwali was extremely stressful as the BP was raising beyond the expected limits and I was constantly in touch with Dr. Nivedita who despite the festive fervour was on constant messages with me guiding me and assuring me. Finally she took the call of admitting me to the hospital the sane night and operating me next morning to avoid any further risk to me and the unborn child. I just told her one thing whatever happens please save my baby. \n\nAnd the next day of Diwali, she came to the hospital in the morning and I was soooo much reassured listening to her voice and seeing her. I was then taken to the OT and in a few minutes I heard my baby cry and through the operation she kept talking to me to keep me engaged. \n\nThis was a surreal experience for me 8 years of marriage, 2 failed pregnancies and here I was living my dream of being a mother. All this could just happen because of Dr. Nivedita Raizada. \n\nThey say Dr's are given the place of GOD, I truly truly truly believe in this now. If you have a dream of holding your child in your hands and you are looking for personalised care and attention, Dr. Nivedita is your go to person. \n\nThank you Dr. Nivedita for helping me live and realise my dream.

Dr Nivedita was our consultant during my first pregnancy. She was always available to answer my calls, messages and see me face to face whenever I had any concerns. Having Dr Nivedita guide me through the pregnancy and answer my questions any time of the day has made the journey much more relaxing and reassuring. She is a very approachable, kind and warm person as well as an amazing doctor. She is one of such doctor who is super positive just seeing her will make you  feel safe and good, a doctor who will encourage you to be active all through your pregnancy to ensure a smooth  normal delivery.  Although in my case I had to go through C-section due some last moment complication though doctor tried her best for it to be normal but our baby wanted something else, but again with such a great doctor my  C-section experience was amazing and I am so grateful for it.  You will never find a doctor who would say sorry to you multiple times for doing a C-section in last moment even though it wasn\u2019t her fault in anyway. I just love her for being sooo good wonderful kind caring doctor who explains everything so well. \nWould highly recommend, you are in safe hands. \n",

She was always available for her patients to discuss any problem or doubt one have during the treatment. I always found her very polite and positive about everything. She always motivates you to do better be in terms of exercise or pregnancy diet which prove to be helpful in my normal delivery finally. She made the normal delivery possible in my case even when my baby was in right posterior position. She always suggested natural ways to combat problems like acidity , cough that I have faced during last trimester.  She never lets you to give up neither during your pregnancy nor during the delivery rather makes you more hopeful by making you look at the positive side of events. Even after my delivery now I am going to miss my visits to her clinic because I always felt very positive and strong after visiting her as she always alleviates my fear and suggests what best for me.  We live in Noida but I don't have a little bit of regret in terms of distance to the clinic because if you have found * **** doctor during your pregnancy phase then distance should be your last of the concern.",

She does not suggest any unnecessary medication or test. She was gynaecologist for my sister and also for my wife in her pregnancy. My sister is blessed with a boy who is now a year old. We are blessed with a baby girl. She cared, guided and coached us into our parenthood. Quite a few complications developed during the pregnancy of my wife including detection of gall stone, very high increase in LFT levels, cord around the neck of the baby, calcium levels dipping very low for the mother which made my wife almost bedridden. Dr. Nivedita not only controlled the complications but also asked her to walk everyday for 20-30 min without straining herself. We followed what she suggested and my wife had a smooth preganancy with normal delivery and was working till the last week of her pregnancy. We are thankful to God as well as Dr Nivedita Raizada for the bundle of joy in our life.",

She advised on every step of pregnancy  throughoutCons:She just does not say yes to anything sweet and we couldn't understand what to get for her post delivery",

I have consulted multiple Gynaecologists during my first baby but I would simply say she is simply the best Gynaecologists one would find in town. She is so caring and would always boost your confidence during your pregnancy and ensures that everything goes right. I would highly recommend everyone to  Just follow her guidance sincerely during the process and be rest assured that she will ensure the best results for you and your baby. Will always be grateful to her for the same. Thank you so much Dr Nivedita mam for all your support. You are a fabulous Doctor to consult for maternity.\n",

She not only answered the call but also kept on following up with him till the time I was fine.\n\nKudos for your dedication towards your profession..All the best!!",

I might be just another patient whose she did delivery but my pregnancy journey was made valuableoy by her way of dealing her patients. She took extreme care of me during my pregnancy,  supported my mentally and physically,  was always there when i panicked for few little things and always stood at odd hours. \nI am glad i chose her of all other doctors and my daughter is with me today healthy and happily. \nA big thanks to her. .i can repeat this line everytime i meet her.

She learnt all my reports, heard patiently my case and suggested many things that helped me to deliver my baby through NVD. She has always been pushing me for natural diet rather medicines and protein supplements. She suggested me to do exercise to make body ready for NVD. On the day of delivery I called her at 2am and she responded swiftly and arranged everything before I reached hospital. Even during the process she has been very encouraging. I had a lobe along with my placenta which had to be removed. She took extra caution to remove the lobe after my delivery. I can say the if you visit Dr. Nivedita, you can be assured that she will take care of you as if she were a family member. I highly recommend Dr. Nivedita for any pregnancy related issues. ",

However I was dissatisfied due to their lack of responsiveness. During covid pandemic, you can't just walk out to the hospital/clinic for every trivial issues. There has to be trust and confidence in the relation between a doctor and her patient. \nFinally I read about Doc Nivedita online and the day I visited her, after that there was no looking back. She is quite patient and cordial. She was always there during the difficult times. Besides, I would recommend her for the economical treatment she attempts to offer to her patients. *** ***** ***** *** *********** ***** *** I think we need more such doctors to make health facilities affordable to all. \n",

She explains the treatment and aliments so well and with facts, ensuring that the patient doesn't get scared or worried unnecessarily. I was diagnosed with big fibroids and was really worried for my health. But she made me strong mentally and emotionally, that actually made me take up the decision to go for laproscopic myomectomy and hysterectomy.  I totally believed in her and that reflected in my surgery too which was performed by her. I had no complications post my surgery and was alright within one day post surgery.  She's truly the best doctor i could have asked for. Very rare to find such doctor in today's world where you can't trust any treatment, especially if it requires you to undergo any kind of major surgery.  I highly recommend Dr.Nivedita for anyone out there looking for a highly professional Gynecologist and someone who wants to be in safe hands for their pregnancy journey, or planning for a baby, and PCOS/PCOD, etc. ***** *** **** ************* ************* *** *********** *********** ",

She is the first doctor I saw for consultation at the time we decided to plan a baby - there will not be a second.\nFrom our very first meeting, my husband and I, both sensed an ease with Dr. Nivedita's all natural approach.\nShe was very methodical in every step and explained the reasons on every decision to be made.\nShe was incredibly thorough and I felt so confident in continuing my care with her.\n\n\nOn the day of delivery : With some complications arising amidst labor pain due to wrapping of umbilical cord around fetal neck twice, I was rushed in emergency to the OT for a C-section.\nWhile everyone was prepping for the surgery, Dr. Nivedita decided to give one more try for a normal one and helped me keep my nerves even in unendurable pain.\nHer presence gave me strength and I was able to welcome my first baby boy in this world that too through a normal delivery. Any other on-call doctor would have certainly gone for a C-section and it was a miracle to have a normal delivery under such circumstances.\nNow, I am recovering well in my postpartum period under her supervision.\n\nWe strongly recommend her to any family and friend without giving a single thought. She is an exceptional human being apart from being a great doctor too.\n\nThank you and your staff for the outstanding support given to me during my time of pregnancy.",

I have been in contact with her from more than 3 years and I consulted her for my second pregnancy. She has always been supportive and my mind-clearing person who helps clear all my doubts. The second delivery was a c-section and it was natural to be anxious but her efficacy, experience and skill is commendable. I have always felt safe in her hands and I am sure her others patients will feel the same. I am actually kinda blessed to have such a doctor who never treated me only as her patient but as a family.

We blindly followed what she said to us, and we got the gift as a Baby Girl that too with Normal Vaginal Delivery.

Many thanks for all the tender care, those patient listening sessions and many thanks for making our parenthood journey beautifully smooth. As you explained and focused on normal delivery from the very beginning and at last you stayed with your decision and successfully made me focus on normal delivery at that tough moment when I was about to loose my hope.

I was actually experiencing bleeding in between periods and came to know the reason behind it when I went for a check up to her. That's when I was diagnosed with a polyp that required to be removed surgically, which was done by her.\nNeedless to mention, she is always on your beck-and-call even post the surgery for any query.\nThank you Nivedita ma'am!",

Then with the experience and advice of dr navedita mem I became the mother of 1 son for the second time. She is very cheerful and simple-minded. She has also been very supportive in the hospital after delivery and if I have any problems she responds to the WhatsApp message instantly. I thank you again. I will ask everyone to seek medical advice.",
