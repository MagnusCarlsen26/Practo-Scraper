She is always so positive about everything (even if there is a problem) and as a patient that is an extremely re-assuring quality. She never passes on the stress of a situation to the patient and knows exactly how to deal with anything and everything. With Dr. Tripat there are no unnecessary problems and all genuine problems have a simple solution. Unlike most doctors today, Dr. Tripat will never make you do unnecessary tests or ultrasounds, unless they are really needed. Throughout my pregnancy I just had 3 ultrasounds and minimal number of routine blood tests (sugar, thyroid and other required tests). Dr. Tripat maybe arguably the busiest gynecologist in Delhi, however, she makes it a point to spend enough time with each and every patient. Dr. Tripat and Dr. Uma (Assistant Doctor) are also always available over the phone for urgent queries and help if needed.\nI believe a gynecologist has to be friendly, approachable and mother-like and Dr. Tripat was more than all of that to me. I trusted her blindly and only did and did not do what she asked me to (I did not read google/BabyCenter or other apps to get answers to my questions).\nI would recommend Dr.Tripat, no questions asked, to anyone. Thanks to Dr. Tripat, my pregnancy and delivery was extremely easy and one of the best experiences of my life.\n",

I still remember her statement \"Stress is for doctors to take, your job is to stay happy and relaxed\" \nunlike other doctors, she would never ask for ultrasounds nad tests unless absolutely necessary. \nshe treats you like our own family and somewhere in her personality there is a motherly persona which is also very prominent in her treatments and counsellings\nI would highly recommend her!!",

The clinic was locked, with no orderlies, there was no drinking water and no explanation by anyone about why the doctor was late for 2 hours. During my appointment I was never checked physically and I had to ask her for the same to make my visit worthwhile. The doctor was super unfriendly which made me very uncomfortable. On my way out the doctor pointed out that her staff doesn't like being asked about her schedule. I found this comment very unprofessional considering most of their clientele is either pregnant or with babies. ",

She is always so positive about everything (even if there is a problem) and as a patient that is an extremely re-assuring quality. She never passes on the stress of a situation to the patient and knows exactly how to deal with anything and everything. With Dr. Tripat there are no unnecessary problems and all genuine problems have a simple solution. Unlike most doctors today, Dr. Tripat will never make you do unnecessary tests or ultrasounds, unless they are really needed. Throughout my pregnancy I just had 3 ultrasounds and minimal number of routine blood tests (sugar, thyroid and other required tests). Dr. Tripat maybe arguably the busiest gynecologist in Delhi, however, she makes it a point to spend enough time with each and every patient. Dr. Tripat and Dr. Uma (Assistant Doctor) are also always available over the phone for urgent queries and help if needed.\nI believe a gynecologist has to be friendly, approachable and mother-like and Dr. Tripat was more than all of that to me. I trusted her blindly and only did and did not do what she asked me to (I did not read google/BabyCenter or other apps to get answers to my questions).\nI would recommend Dr.Tripat, no questions asked, to anyone. Thanks to Dr. Tripat, my pregnancy and delivery was extremely easy and one of the best experiences of my life.\n",

Mine was a complicated one but the doctor made me feel like everything is very normal. \nI met her before conception and her advice worked like a miracle. Although she is one of the busiest doctors in Delhi, she gives plenty of time and very calm & patient. I still remember her statement \"Stress is for doctors to take, your job is to stay happy and relaxed\" \nunlike other doctors, she would never ask for ultrasounds nad tests unless absolutely necessary. \nshe treats you like our own family and somewhere in her personality there is a motherly persona which is also very prominent in her treatments and counsellings\nI would highly recommend her!!",
