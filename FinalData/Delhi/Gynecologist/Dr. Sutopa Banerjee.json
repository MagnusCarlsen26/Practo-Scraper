She is a brilliant medical professional and by nature she is very understanding and treats her patients very calmly and in a friendly manner. We have been consulting dr Sutopa since last 7years and since then , there has been no looking back. She has always been extremely supportive of our decisions and has always guided us with best possible solutions to our gynaec problems . \n\nMy pregnancy journey started with few ups and downs as there were some complications. But dr sutopa guided me at every step of my pregnancy journey and helped me deliver a beautiful and healthy baby boy 2 months back and I cannot be more than grateful to dr Sutopa for making it happen so smoothly. \n\nWe started with dr Sutopa from the day we started planning for a baby. She asked us to take few tests and also guided us to take pre-conception plan from curelinks . This really helped us conceive within 2 months of our visit to dr Sutopa. Once we conceived , we blindly followed her and did whatever was required to deliver a healthy baby. She was very polite and was always available on call to help us with smallest of the doubts. \n\nHer infectious smile is all that a person would need to make them feel good. After knowing her for so long, she is like a family to us and treats me like her sister . She has always been supportive and I can't think of anyone else for my gynae problems. I have even recommended her to my friends and family. All you need to do is trust her and she will take care of the rest.\n\nWe would like to extend our sincere thanks to mam and her team of doctors and support staff for giving us the most happiest and special moments our life .. May God bless you with good health and happiness and may you remain the source of happiness for many others just like us . \n\nRegards\nSamarjit and Parul",

This is our second child  pregnancy.We visited to Dr Sutopa with confusing mind that whether we should go with this preganancy or not as our first pregnancy was having complications.She explained us everything and did all required investigations and convinced us that this second pregnancy is God's miracle and we should go for this. We took decision to go further with this pregnancy and by God's grace on 9 May 2024 she delivered us a beautiful daughter and younger sister to my 5 year old son. Also I can definitely say that her availability is superb. The moment you pinged her for any concerns and within 5 minutes you get reply that too in Sundays.\nLast but not least I can say if you taking treatment from her means you are in safe hands. \n\nRegards,\nKawal & Kanwar\n",

She is a brilliant medical professional and by nature she is very understanding and treats her patients very calmly and in a friendly manner. We have been consulting dr Sutopa since last 7years and since then , there has been no looking back. She has always been extremely supportive of our decisions and has always guided us with best possible solutions to our gynaec problems . \n\nMy pregnancy journey started with few ups and downs as there were some complications. But dr sutopa guided me at every step of my pregnancy journey and helped me deliver a beautiful and healthy baby boy 2 months back and I cannot be more than grateful to dr Sutopa for making it happen so smoothly. \n\nWe started with dr Sutopa from the day we started planning for a baby. She asked us to take few tests and also guided us to take pre-conception plan from curelinks . This really helped us conceive within 2 months of our visit to dr Sutopa. Once we conceived , we blindly followed her and did whatever was required to deliver a healthy baby. She was very polite and was always available on call to help us with smallest of the doubts. \n\nHer infectious smile is all that a person would need to make them feel good. After knowing her for so long, she is like a family to us and treats me like her sister . She has always been supportive and I can't think of anyone else for my gynae problems. I have even recommended her to my friends and family. All you need to do is trust her and she will take care of the rest.\n\nWe would like to extend our sincere thanks to mam and her team of doctors and support staff for giving us the most happiest and special moments our life .. May God bless you with good health and happiness and may you remain the source of happiness for many others just like us . \n\nRegards\nSamarjit and Parul",

This is our second child  pregnancy.We visited to Dr Sutopa with confusing mind that whether we should go with this preganancy or not as our first pregnancy was having complications.She explained us everything and did all required investigations and convinced us that this second pregnancy is God's miracle and we should go for this. We took decision to go further with this pregnancy and by God's grace on 9 May 2024 she delivered us a beautiful daughter and younger sister to my 5 year old son. Also I can definitely say that her availability is superb. The moment you pinged her for any concerns and within 5 minutes you get reply that too in Sundays.\nLast but not least I can say if you taking treatment from her means you are in safe hands. \n\nRegards,\nKawal & Kanwar\n",

We especially loved how Dr. Sutopa Banerjee really took her time to explain the conditions with us as well as my wife\u2019s treatment options. \nDue to our change in city and unavoidable circumstances we had to move in the mid of lmy wife\u2019s pregnancy period. But it was really felt great when the other doctors (a senior professional having 45 years of experience) praised how Dr. Sutopa Banerjee managed the initial complication which was appeared for my wife\u2019s pregnancy. \nStaffs were great too.

Doctors in that hospital are really\ngood but we wanted someone that could provide us help and guidance in this journey off the clinic/hospital too whenever we are in need. I was really worried about\nit and then I used Practo to find nearest gynecologist and shortlisted two but chose Dr. Sutopa due to her details and patient feedback. Obviosly not all feedbacks\nare good but lets be honest one or two reviews doesn't help you pick or drop.\n\nSo we visited her then she explained things very nicely, we didn't have to ask her anything, it is like with her experience of more than 2 decades she know what \ncould be the psyche of patient and what are their most probable concerns. With her first consulation we were happy but going forward I saw that she is writing many \ntests at every stage and also used to prescribe many medicines, at this stage you might discuss this with your friends and family, some of them surely will say this \ndoctor is doing this for monetary benefit blah blah but trust me you need to TRUST Dr. Banerjee because this is what we did at every stage.\n\nLike most of the people we also wanted Normal delivery but we will be honest we did not have too much confidence because my wife's pain threshold is very low and when \ndue date was nearing we used to discuss this to make up our mind so that when time comes we don't get nervous or demotivated. We discussed this with doctor and she told us\nwe can decide if we want but we will wait till 40 weeks for normal delivery unless there is any complication found, and at this point i would like to highlight that she has\nno agenda other than making sure Mother and Child both are safe and healthy. So if takes to write multiple tests or to prescribe medicines for mother, that looks\nmoney making agenda to some people, she will do that. She is really SOFT SPOKEN and KIND but she wont let you take her lightly when comes to patient care. \n\nAfter waiting for 34 weeks there was Preterm labor and we were not happy because that means Mother and baby both will have to suffer but Dr. Sutopa made it go away\nwith immediate hospitalization of my wife and 2days of care, by the way she operates and delivers baby in Fortis hospital Vasant Kunj. And after waiting 3 more\nweeks i.e. in 37 weeks 4days time came and we reached hospital and she saw my wife in labor and she knew about her pain threshold so she prescribed Epidural to ease with labor\nbut did not chose to do C-Section and with all these we saw our beautiful Girl Child and we were too happy as our WISH came TRUE.\n\nWith above story of more than 37 Weeks I would like to Suggest to try Dr. Sutopa Banerjee. Complete Care of Women with Warmth, Kindness.\n\nAlso Staff at her clinic are also very nice, kind and Friendly.",

I was able to share our previous experience with her because of her friendly behaviour and she listens to all the problems/concerns we had. *** ** *** **** ************** She tried all her best to save my wife's first pregnancy but it was too late. After that she did some tests and found the cause and she worked with all her knowledge and everything what ever she can, and now we have been blessed with a baby boy because of her care, support and love (with thoda sa daant\ud83d\ude0a). I don't know how other doctor treats their patients but she was worried more than us and I know why because she calls my wife \"Beta\" whenever we visited her. She was there for us whenever we needed her. She treated us like we were her child. All staff are also good and polite and build friendly connection. On 27th May at around 4:50 AM my wife said water is leaking and she call Dr. Sutopa Banerjee and she asked to get admitted. My wife was very nervous and scared that what will happen, everything is fine or not, my wife was continuously asking when Dr. Sutopa will arrive, and when she sees Dr. Sutopa all her fear were gone and she said \"ab mujhe darr nahi lag raha, apni Dr. aa gai mujhe darr nahi hai sab accha hoga ab\" and yes all went well and we have a new member in our family because of her\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f.

Doctor\u2019s guidance is not only source of medicine which Sutopa Ma\u2019am has proved, she has been amazing health guide, great support system and most importantly she has motivated when I needed it the most. \n\nMe and my family will always be thankful to Sutopa Ma\u2019am. I still remember my first visit to her clinic, I was so positive when I met Sutopa Ma\u2019am. I called my husband and said I found my gynaecologists as I was impressed by her in my first visit. I started visiting Ma\u2019am in end of 2019 when we started planning however I had PCOS/PCOD so Ma\u2019am asked me to go through several tests and  when we were through all those tests in 2020, we had covid at its peak so me and my husband put stop to our doctor visits and in March 2022, we visited Sutopa Ma\u2019am and discussed everything with her and further with her guidance we conceived in June 2022. She not only guided us with her knowledge instead she guided my professionally as well as mentally. I still remember her words - Don\u2019t think about society and what people are saying around you, you give you best and I will give my best and let keep everything in God\u2019s hand and here we are proud parent of our beautiful baby girl.\n\nThank you for blessing our life Ma\u2019am\ud83d\ude0a I would definitely recommend Dr Sutopa Banerjee to my friends and family in fact I have already started\ud83d\udc4d\n\nThankful & Grateful!",

Who made my experience at Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj a wonderful one.\nDr. Sutopa and her team are doing a great job at Fortis. Everyone was at their best, Dr. Sutopa is magical, no words to thank her enough. \nAlso her PA is doing good work. The Labor room team, the nurses and the supporting staff all did their best, and are very professional.\n\nI was happy with their services and returned home with my bundle of joy. \n\nPregnancy Journey: \nMy pregnancy journey was going smoothly until the 37th Week, everything was looking fine. I was very excited and fully prepared for the normal delivery. However, things changed overnight, we discovered on the 37th Week blood test, that I have a high risk pregnancy and I need to bring my baby out as soon as possible. As unexpected, not sure how to handle the situation, we were clueless on what action to take forward. Super stressful moments as my countdown was on. \nWe re-discussed  the same with Dr. Sutopa. where she explains the current reality, possible circumstances, and available options and their possible \nconsequences.  which certainly helped us to make the right decision at the right time. \n\nWhen I was in the Operation Theater I was extremely scared until I saw Dr. Sutopa. Everyone may have their own experiences of her. But for me the Aura that she carries to her profession is extreme - \nShe stood there and did my delivery & operation just like a DEVI would have done. \n\nMy family and I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Sutopa Banerjee and her team for their wonderful work.\n\n\nBest regards,\nMamoni Tanti\nVasant Kunj ",

She is extremely polite and friendly. She responded to each and every questions (no matter how silly it was :P) during face-to-face consultation or on whatsapp.\n\nIn my case, initially she wanted to wait for normal delivery but things became a bit critical at the end of my pregnancy. It was already full term and could have ended up in a bad way. Dr. Sutopa took the right call and suggested for immediate admission for a complete day for monitoring. We are blessed with a healthy baby girl and all thanks goes to her only. She is now helping me with post-pregnancy care as well.\n\nFinally we are really thankful to all the staffs in the clinic. They are also extremely helpful. they guided us from booking appointments, to getting the medicines or getting the blood tested and it's all under one roof which made everything very easy for us. The clinic is tidy and clean.\n\nHonestly, we have no words to explain, how much grateful we are to her. \n\nSo thank you so much again, Dr. Sutopa, for making our dream come true. We highly recommend her for Obstetrician/ Gynecological issues.\n\nRegards,\nSanyal Family\n",

We used to visit her clinic from all the way from Indirapuram to Vasankunj and she has been so calm, graceful and caring to treat us as her own family member. We had to stay in Bangalore for 4-5 months during this wonderful journey of 9 months as my wife was posted in Bangalore and Dr  Sutopa kept seeing us virtually with the same love and affection, we never felt like we are not around her. Finally, on 4th Oct, 2021, we have been blessed with an angel in Fortis Vasantkunj under Dr. Sutopa Ma'am supervision through normal delivery, she convinced us for normal delivery with all her gudinace and we followed her advice diligently and it was a very good decision for us. She kept on believing in us and we had our utmost belief in herself that as along as we are under Dr. Sutopa's Ma'am hand, we are in the safest place. Dr. Sutopa is eversmiling, compassionate and an amicable person who has her medical expertise for all your problems with a definite solution. She never gets irritated with our so many questions and queries, she betters your half of your problmes just by her graceful smile and advice. Just to mention here, our delivery became complicated at the last moment, however, Dr. Sutopa stood by us and she did her best to bless us with a healthy little angel for which we would be grateful forever to you ma'am. At last I would like to mention, it is being said as \" Doctor is God\", we really meant and felt this after meeting Dr. Sutopa Ma'am. Thank you so much ma'am for your kind supervision and love during our wonderful journey of this 9 months of pregnancy, look forward to stay connected with you in future as well.\n\nWarm Regards,\nKrishna & Shikha\n(Proud parents of your first online Baby \" Krishika\" )",

Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!\nI was having critical pregnancy issues and visited many renowned hospitals in NCR but my bleeding issues in 3rd month of pregnancy was not cured and I was really very upset.  Then from one of my husband\u2019s colleague, I came to know about Dr. SUTOPA BANERJEE. After 1st visit I was fully satisfied and confident that now me and my 3 moths pregnancy will be well taken care by Dr. SUTOPA BANERJEE CLINIC.  Till the 37 weeks I visited her clinic and followed all the suggestions and taken medicines as prescribed and recently I am blessed with a baby with normal delivery. Thank you Dr. SUTOPA BANERJEE ma\u2019am. I love you.  May God bless you with good health and all happiness.   \nThe services that I receive from Dr. SUTOPA BANERJEE Clinic- Complete Care for Women: Advanced Obs-Gyn & Fertility Clinic is excellent. Dr. SUTOPA BANERJEE and the staff are friendly and ensure that I am properly informed about my health and care. I would have no qualms in recommending them to friendly and friends. I am so glad I chose Dr. SUTOPA BANERJEE Clinic and would highly recommend to anyone.\n\n",

During our difficult phase of life we have met lot of gynecologists but sutopa mam is exceptionally different no doubt she is the best among all of them.\nDuring first consultation with mam, we were afraid and have lot of questions in mind she politely listened with patience and examine reports of past history. As it is a case of high risk pregnancy mam tackle our case with highest level of safety with all precautionary measures. She is extremely polite, soft-spoken and treats her patients like his own child. She is dat much worried as we are till the things become normal. After 6 months of pregnancy when there are no such complications mam still always keep an eye on each and everything and guide accordingly. \nMam has such a pleasant smile  and soft spoken nature that once u meet her u will start feeling positive and complications will go on its own. At clinic everything is systematic and well managed. Mam will never hurry you u can ask as many questions u have in ur mind. U can only leave once u r completely satisfied and want to go out on ur own. \nDuring covid time when no doctor wants to investigate u physically she is d one who care for his patients and investigate u (if reqd.) by wearing all protective equipment\u2019s.\nWe are extremely satisfied and happy with kind of treatment and care we got from Dr. sutopa mam till we got our sweet princess in our hand. We highly recommend Dr. Sutopa Banerjee especially for high risk pregnancy as an Obstetrician-gynecologist.\n\nThank you so much for everything,\nMrs. & Mr. Neetu Lalit Meena",

She is a brilliant medical professional and addresses all the concerns that you might have and also provides you with the much needed emotional support. I always used to feel content as she patiently listens and answers your every query.My journey of 9 months wasn't as easy but with her supervision it has been lovely. In the early stage of pregnancy I had quite lot of complications which she handled brilliantly. She remembers the details of the patient and never misses on anything. There have been quite lot of instances when she went out of her way to make sure that the I am doing fine. Whenever I used to send her reports or used to ask any question, her replies used to be very prompt.I had to undergo an emergency section on December 19, 2020, after decreased movement and I am thankful that she acted  so quick and my baby was delivered healthy. All thanks to her that my recovery also is going very well. Even my family loved the generous personality of Dr. Sutopa. My pregnancy and delivery has been awesome under her supervision and I highly recommend her. Me and my husband can't thank her enough. I surely am lucky to have found her. Had there been an option of rating a thousand stars, we would surely give.P.S: In this time when we are struggling with covid, the clinic is very well sanitised and also appointments are priorly fixed with no hassle of waiting.

So strongly advise to the couples to spend good time and energy in selecting the doctor. But once you select the doctor, start trusting him/her for the best result.\n\nLike most of the parents, we also wanted to have normal delivery and did lot of research in selecting the doctor.\n\nAfter first few visits of the Dr. S. Banerjee, I came to understand that doctor plays important role in mode of delivery (only after mother), but it's further depends on many other factors of pregnancy. So best we can do is give our honest efforts and make best possible decision in various situations during the different phases of pregnancy.\n\nDr. S. Banerjee has strong hold on the subject. She listened all the concerns patiently and offered different options for what I could do. It happens too often that doctors make patients feel trapped into one decision, this was not the case with Dr. S. Banerjee. I really felt in control over the situation and was able to use her as an educated resource to help me make the best decision possible. \n\nOne of many quality of Dr. S. Banerjee is she speak to the point and on right time which is very effective and helped us.\n\nDuring my visits, I found that the staff is also very helpful and care a lot about patients.\n\nThereafter, journey of 9 months remained easy under expert guidance and supervision of Dr. S. Banerjee. Only thing I did was stayed positive, stress free and religiously followed the Doctor\u2019s advice.\n\nHappy and Highly Satisfied Mother\n\nRajni J Bhardwaj",

A person who restored our faith in the profession of Doctor. Her infectious smile is all a person need to feel good. We had a baby boy, 2 months back & we give all credit to her for making it happen so smoothly. The passion she has for her work & the effort she gave in our case is unparallel. \n\nWe still remember when we started visiting her, a bit nervous, we had lot of ambiguity in our mind, but she gave enough tym & efforts to make us comfortable & guide us through. As tym passed, she made the whole process, smooth, till my wife delivered. \n\nShe was always available (even at late night hours), whenever we wanted a suggestion or clear our smallest doubt. As it was our first experience, we were extremely wary of everything & use to ask even the smallest things, but she was always patient enough to answer our weirdest queries.\n\nMany people suggested us to switch our doctor, quoting that she is unnecessarily expensive, we stayed to her, coz we feel that without proper & regular check ups & medications, no one can access the growth of fetus. The final outcome has made our belief on her even more stronger & we r happy on our decision to continue with her.\n\nAfter knowing her for over 10 months, she is more of a family to us. She has been like a mother to my wife, being strict as and when required & always patient, supportive & concerned. She is a synonym of her field & we can't think of any1 else.\n\nWe only recommend her to everyone. All you need to do, is to trust her & she will take care of the rest.\n\nThank you Madam, for giving us the most happiest & special moments of our married life. May God bless you with all happiness & good health & you be always remain a source of happiness for many others like us. We don't know, how to give ratings in 4* & 5*. For us you deserve the whole galaxy....",

From the very outset, she very clearly explained all aspects of the high risk nature of my pregnancy in a clearcut and most importantly, reassuring manner. She ensured that I had more frequent check ups, necessary tests, took prenatal supplements and neccesary vaccinations and observed other precautions as directed by her, and she was always available over phone even at odd hours in case of any urgent queries. No doubt she is knowledgeable and an expert in her field, but more important than that, it is her calm and reassuring demeanour that helps put her patients at ease and put their trust in her. She has a team of very polite, professional and helpful staff at her clinic, which is so important for making her patients feel comfortable and at ease.\n\nThanks to Dr. Banerjee, we welcomed our healthy twin babies in September after a smooth sailing pregnancy, and she continues to guide us with postpartum checkups and her postpartum care plan which includes personalized diet plans, exercises, mental health classes, consultations with pediatrician, lactation consultant, etc.",

Apart from being caring and patient listener as a doctor, she has great medical intuition.  When we first approached her we had already visited places like AIIMS, MAX, Fortis, Columbia Asia and couple of other top gynaes within Delhi NCR. We had become hopeless to the extent that we had started thinking of adoption. But she guided us without any over promises and suggested us long term treatment, due to which my wife's health improved a lot and we had a successful IVF baby. During the pregnancy, she was very caring and proactively monitored my wife's situation. We also cherish those moments when she tried to discipline us with her tough love approach. During child birth, had it not been for her unique medical intuition, our child could have suffered toxic exposure to his own excreta/laterine within the womb. But she guided us well and did the caesarian well in time to prevent such situation. For us, she is a god send. My wife is still under her treatment and we are thankful to god that he brought her in to our lives. She is the perfect example of how a doctor should treat his/her profession - as compared to the ones who treat this profession merely as a money minting machine without much regard for human life and emotions. God bless you Dr. Sutopa and all UR loved ones. May god continue to shower you with expertise and strength and health, so that you can continue doing god's good work.",

We did lot of research on whom to consult, finally we got online reviews of Dr. Sutopa. We we're bit skeptical if there will be any issues or not. The moment we met doctor she was smiling and and positive about everything and prescribed some test. Where some tests were up and down but how she described it was amazing she said \" everything look fine yeh thoda sa badha hua hai koi baat nahi medicine de dedenge\". It was such a relief cause she handled it so humbly without creating any hype or panic.\nAfter 2months we again visited Dr. And yes this was the day when we got a good news of confirmed pregnancy. Then regular follow ups started where my wife had several ups and downs as this was our first time. But at every stage Dr. Was so empathizing that we feel confident and positive this created a trust on her.The way she treated us was like her own family. \nFinally the day of labour started and we were prepared as she suggested about the preparation for admission.\nAfter extreme labour pain of 9 hrs when there was no progress from fetus side during the last hour, she suggested if we want to go for a c-section? She gave us ample of time to think about all possiblities and options. So we decided to go for it. A C-section which was a hype for us and many of us ....trust me it was not at all frightening... It was a matter of max 30 mins procedure. I had chance to see this live ..all because of doctor and her team who allowed me to be with my wife during this procedure .. it cannot be expressed in words when you are the first one to see your baby in this world. \nIts not only mother and father who suffered these 9 months..... Its the doctor as well who took care of us as their family during any hour of clock. We are really thankful to Dr. Sutopa Banerjee for all her support and care she had shown. We have recommended her in past and we will strongly recommend her in future as well.",

Having planned my pregnancy in mid thirties, I was really worried for many things but having Dr. Sutopa by my side, made this whole journey easy, beautiful and memorable for me and my family. At every step, she advised all requisite investigations and suggested the best of medications and other miscellaneous; like pregnancy care plans and stem cell preservation benefits. Her pre and post natal care plans, which includes time to time diet charts, yoga classes, lactation and pain management classes etc....everything was so much helpful. \nDr. Sutopa was always available to answer any query if I had. Her clinic offers all the best facilities one shall have and her staff is really supportive and caring. One most important thing that I really admire about her is she is not just good professionally but she is empathetic towards her patients. She is like an angel to me and godmother to my baby. I would strongly recommend people to do consult her atleast once if you have query or issue regarding any gynecological problem.

I had a sense that you supported me in having the type of birth that I wanted. I felt that you were the perfect doctor for my delivery. Perhaps it was your quiet, calm demeanour of your extensive year of experience. \nMaybe it was a bit of both. I felt safe and reassured during a time that was new and unpredictable for me-- giving birth for the first time. I am grateful to you as well as your team staff that were involved. Throughout my pregnancy, I've heard only good things from you and your team. So, it's not just me, I speak on behalf of my family . \n\nThank you \n\nSincerely\n\nAnanya patra chaurasia",

Under her supervision I had undergone a laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cyst and that has helped me come out of the fear of surgery.\n\nShe has always guided me for going through normal procedures for pregnancy. There were certain complications in my first trimester for which I was put on bed rest for 2 months. Doctor made sure that I was following all the medication and treatment properly. The best thing that I like about her is that she\u2019s always available on phone for any query or issues that you face. At times she would have called on her own after seeing the test reports advising what needs to be done.\n\nThe 9 months of pregnancy is a wonderful yet very difficult journey when anxiety levels reaches the peak as most of the things are not known to you. With the guidance of Doctor who always cheered me up to smile and remain stress free, I was able to deliver my first child without any complications.\n\nHer staff is also very courteous and humble especially Shravan, Pinky and Sandhya. The clinic visit was so regular, almost twice a week for injections, follow up but they took care of me like an extended family member and made me feel like home.\n\nI will highly recommend everyone to visit Dr. Sutopa Banerjee \ud83d\ude0a",

So as soon as i was given the Epidural,I feel relax and slept until I was told it was time to push..epidural is so effective and got the positive result.Recently on date 14/december/2022 I was blessed with a baby boy through normal delivery.The entire pregnancy experience has been such a delight,thanks to all her guidance and care.I am extremely satisfied and happy with kind of treatment and care I got from Dr.sutopa mam.I would highly recommend Dr.Sutopa Banerjee as an obstetrician-gynecologist.Thank you so much mam and all the  entire teams for everything.May you be blessed forever \ud83d\ude4f \u2764\ufe0f",

With no relief from medicines and after visiting many doctors in last 2 yaers, I approached Dr Sutopo who advised hysterectomy as a permanent cure. Due to enlarged volume of my uterus, I had apprehensions if the surgery can be performed laproscopically. To my satisfaction, she performed a TLH with minimal blood loss and that too in almost an hour while the average time to perform a TLH is 2 to 3 hrs. Post surgey recovery is also satisfactory. Dr Sutopo is a very caring and friendly doctor. She patiently answers all your queries and makes you feel safe and comfortable. Highly recommended for gynae related issues Thanks a lot Doctor!",

While some doctors scared me off with possible complications during my pregnancy, Dr. Sutopa seemed more positive and confident in dealing with my pregnancy. \n\nShe monitored my whole pregnancy very closely to ensure that both babies remain healthy and remain inside the womb for a minimum duration of 36 weeks.  \n\nAt 32 weeks, the ultrasound showed that while the first baby was vertex, the second baby was in transverse position. When the position of babies didn\u2019t change till 36 weeks, Dr. Sutopa suggested a planned C-section. We planned the cesarean on 16 November 2016, but went in labour on 14th. \n\nIn OT, when the whole team was ready to begin the C-section procedure, Dr, Sutopa noted that I was fully dilated and suggested a vaginal delivery, with the team ready for an emergency c-section. Not long from then, I had both my babies delivered vaginally, safe and healthy with me \n  \nWould highly recommend and thank Dr. Sutopa to all the \u2018would be moms\u2019. \n",

I had a fibroid cyst and I had seen plenty of doctors but no one made me feel easy and comfortable and gave me asurance that it can be taken out laprosocopicaly and that we have tried everything with medicines before going for a surgery.\n\nThen it was my pregnency with a lot of ups and downs like my progestrone being low and her giving me confidence that even with low egg count i can have a healthy pregnency and conception. In my 26th week i had slight bleeding for which she responded mid night and made me and my husband feel comfortable and that we are in good hands. In 36 week I delivered a beautiful baby girl (normal delivery all because of her) and were able to go back home the same day from the hospital. She did not let us panic due to the covid situation and kept assuring us that we are doing good. We just want to thank her from the bottom of our heart and to us she is next to god coz she was the one because of whom I have my daughter in my arms. Thank you ma\u2019am.",

However, with every passing visit, I came to know and realize that I am in good hands.\n\nIt has been over good one and half year since that first interaction and it has been a wonderful experience so far. She helped me with my treatment and the result was that I delivered a healthy baby boy on 28th Feb 2018! After endless struggle of 4 years, this was the happiest moment we could ever hoped for.\n\nAfter all this time, I can vouch for her that she is the best! You can talk to her about almost anything. You can pour out your heart, ask a number of questions to which you will get a warm smile and of course, relevant answer to your questions. \n\nI recommend her to everyone who is looking for a friendly yet someone who will also help you with accurate and efficient treatment. Place your trust on her & she will take care of the rest.\n\nThank you doctor for your endless support and guidance all these years. Most of the important is for giving us our life :)\n\nMay God bless you and your family with all the happiness one could ever hope for.\n\nRadhapyari",

Most surprising part was the D day, it was an anxious wait outside the labor room for close to 2 hour, and guess what we have our daughter delivered to us with Normal delivery. The baby weight was close to 4 kg, and in any normal circumstances a Doctor would have gone for C section, if it not have been Dr Sutopa. Doctor and her team did here best and successfully performed the Normal delivery. Not only that, she was able to make the labor pain fading away so quickly. We can't thank enough to Dr Sutopa for making us Proud parents with such a relaxed atmosphere around.\n\nImpressive parts:\n- Honesty and Ethics\n- Friendliness \n- Timeliness (Respect for the appointment time)\n- Patient care (Normal delivery is the proof)\n\nBest,\nAshwini",

You are incredible at what you do and we're SO thankful we found you!\nThank you for delivering Ivanshi and all the care leading up to the delivery. I have recovered well and appreciate all the advice and tips you gave me beforehand about how to deliver a baby. The class you recommend at The Cradle was fantastic and helped me to feel less anxious about the process. I look forward to seeing you again when I become pregnant again.\nDelivering my latest baby was much easier than I anticipated. Thank you for coming to the hospital during the late evening to deliver Ivanshi. I was very glad to have you there since you\u2019ve been caring for me since the start the pregnancy. Your easy going manner helped me to relax. I am glad everything went so well!\nThank you for recognizing that I needed to have an emergency C-section, your quick decision and analysis of the situation likely saved my life and the baby\u2019s.

I have been really very lucky to have Dr Sutopa as my guiding \"Angel\" during that special phase of my life. \nAfter realizing I was pregnant, my husband and me started searching about various gynaes available in Gurgaon. Haven gone through lots of ups and down earlier in life for several years, I was very apprehensive about gynaes in particular, but the moment I started describing my condition to Dr Sutopa, it appeared that all my worries have gone and we got a feeling that we are in safe hands now. \n\nShe has really been very supportive, helpful, kind and a wonderful human being with a very sweet smile. The safety of mother and child has always been her concern. She is the one who understands the tensions and emotional condition of a first timer mother, I remember when I was 28 weeks pregnant, I had called her up at night around 12:30 to describe certain complications, she patiently listened to me and advised me certain medications, later she called me back at 3 AM to check my condition, I was really touched with this caring gesture of hers. \n\nShe is the one who sticks only to necessary medications and tests. Finally around 2 weeks back we are blessed with our cute little bundle of joy, all thanks to Dr Sutopa, our guiding angel. Thanks mam for everything.",

She advised me to get 2nd consultation then I visited Dr. Sutopa. During my first meet when I asked about travel , Dr. told me straight away that she need to conduct some tests. She would recommend travel only after checking my reports. That was \" trust winner\" for my family. My reports were not good and I was advised complete rest, no travelling in any case. My pregnancy had multiple complications fibroid, protein deficiency etc. Dr. Sutopa was like guardian angel who kept a  watch over me and my baby. If today I am healthy mother of healthy baby girl after my c section surgery along fibroid removal surgery all credit goes to Dr. Sutopa. For all would be parents ...I would advise if you do not want to spend 9 months worrying about mother and child well being .....please consult her.

From being available absolutely any time we needed her, answering even the most silly doubts and questions, to giving importance to our delivery-related wishes as far as was possible without causing harm to the baby, Dr.Sutopa has been so much more than just a doctor through our pregnancy. \nHer medical advice has been sound from the get-go, and her calm demeanor even when I contracted COVID-19 in April, helped me stay calm right through. Any time we were faced with a slightly complicated situation, Dr.Sutopa took the time to decide what she felt would be the best course for both me as well the baby, without just rushing into anything, and this only increased our level of confidence in her advice.\n\nDr.Sutopa has been a friend and guide while being wholly professional and extremely competent, and that isn't a very easy balance to maintain. Her entire team, both in her OPD clinic as well as in Fortis, took the best possible care of us, and for that and so much more, my husband and myself, and our families, will be forever grateful.",

In the hospital on the D day she and her team were very good and took great care of me and the baby. Rest of my stay in the hospital was comfortable as she and her team of doctors made sure to pay visit time to time and keep a check on my condition. \nDr. Sutopa's happy and friendly attitude made me feel comfortable in asking her n number of questions during my visits or on what's app. She was prompt enough to answer the questions or any doubt that I had.  \nI had a c-section delivery for which she made sure that I do not feel scared about it. She discussed my situation very openly and frankly with me and my husband and helped us in taking a decision for c-section delivery with assurance that it will be smooth as my entire pregnancy went. \nAt the end I am happy to say this I have been blessed by a baby boy with the help of Dr. Sutopa. \nThank you Dr. Sutopa.

My kids were not kept in NICU even for two hours. The moment my wife came from OT they handed over my kids to me. Dr. Banerjee is so accurate with her dosage and timing of medicines . She knows when to start Progesterone , and other medicines which helps to sustain the pregnancy. I do not know when she takes time for her sleep , You get replies immediately even at 2 AM .  or be it at 6 AM. She is easy to reach . She is polite and and listen to your query patiently and will guide you accordingly. Friends there might be other good doctors around but trust me for high risk pregnancy she is the only one i can think of.  During 37  weeks i did not have any issue , it is no less than a miracle .

I went to her to seek treatment for vaginal candidiasis in 2019. I cannot emphasize enough how amazingly she comforts her patients and attend their needs. Once my treatment for candidiasis was over, she started guiding me to conceive. Too good to be true, but under her planned guidance, i conceived within a month of trying. First few months of my pregnancy I was away in a different city but her constant telephonic guidance helped me to stay confident till I reached Delhi in my 2nd trimester. She is super kind, knowledgeable and always reachable at the time of need, even at the most odd hours. I trusted her for my pregnancy and can proudly say, that i couldn't have had a better doctor than her. I had a few complications during the last few weeks of my pregnancy when I developed GDM and ICP and started feeling so stressed. But with Dr. Sutopa's guidance, i delivered successfully on June 25th and is blessed with a beautiful baby girl. Besides GDM and ICP, I had a couple of other issues which made my pregnancy high risk and I was advised elective Cesarean section considering the baby's safety. I can literally vouch on her expertise and would definitely recommend her to anyone seeking advanced treatment in obstetrics and gynaecology. Thank you once again, ma'am for all your support \ud83d\ude42.",

Despite all the struggles, despite Covid and the stress everyone is going through, Dr. Sutopa give sufficient time to her patient for consultation. She genuinely cares for her patients and knows what\u2019s best for you and your situation. \n\nwe were devastated after two miscarriage last year, so we decided to get help of Dr Sutopa again. As in Jan 2019 with her help we got our first baby boy with Normal Delivery without any problem. This time We traveled 100 Km round trip for every appointment from Greater Noida to Delhi because we knew this worth it.\n\nWords cant express how much happy my wife and I were with the care we received at the Dr Sutopa Banerjee Clinic. From the moment we had our initial consultation, Dr. Sutopa and staff were supportive and very helpful. To make a long story short, by the grace of God along with the help of Dr. Sutopa and her team we were able to successfully get our second baby boy with Normal Delivery in may 2021. \n\nThank You Very Much Dr. Sutopa Banerjee. You are really a God Mother for our both sons.\n\nFrom Happy Parents : Aarti & Rishabh",

Dr Banerjee answered all our queries patiently and advised required tests and medications. In the 4th month, we moved to Delhi and started consulting Dr Sutopa at her clinic. We received the proper attention. She is very particular about her patients. She is very calm and warm as a doctor. We could also clear our doubts over WhatsApp. When we found baby has growth issue during our 6th month. Dr Sutopa suggested necessary treatment and our baby was growing fine after that. Along with that the staff at her clinic are professional and very helpful. \n\nThe professionalism is reflected even in the way the clinic is maintained. The clinic is very neat and clean. Our baby is now one month old and we are thankful to her for her help and support.\n\nWe highly recommend her.\n\n\n\nWe are very thankful to Dr Sutopa and her staff.",

Getting this done during the times of covid was another challenge as the availability of resources in hospitals was limited. \n\nWhen my mother met Dr. Sutopa, as scared as she was, Dr. Sutopa showed a lot of compassion, understanding her situation and made her feel confident about going through this process. So we finalised this is the doctor she feels safest with.\n\nWhen the surgery started, there were more complications than what we expected and Dr. Sutopa handled the situation with utmost diligence and care. The surgery lasted longer than we expected and unforeseen circumstances arose. During the surgery, my mother\u2019s urine bladder got bruised(which happens often) and the doctor did her best and responded to the situation immediately and had other doctors onboard. (I am mentioning this because we have heard from other patients that they get to know about this injury after the surgery which had them suffer fir long)\n\nNow, after 3 months, we have seen our mom recover well and really fast and we are glad that we consulted Dr. Sutopa.",

All the relevant tests were done very timely to keep everything under check and control.\nWe have been blessed with a baby girl, thanks to the untiring efforts and incredible surgical skills of Dr. Banerjee.\nThe post csec healing has gone very well and Dr. Banerjee has taken care of every minute detail for the pre and post delivery health of the mother.\nDr. Banerjee keeps herself the most up to date with all the latest medical literature for the benefit of her patients and her clinic was extremely well managed in logistics and safety measures even during the covid crisis.\nWe are filled with immense gratitude for having come in touch with Dr. Banerjee, for all her guidance and care when we needed it most.

We had our doubts in our minds, since its not good just to believe on online recommendations. But believe me, she is jem of a person. She helped us a lot, there were few ups and downs during my wife's pregnancy, which Dr. Sutopa handled very well. She is always there for you, just a phone call away or you can get all details via whatsapp as well, won't call you for every minute things. We visited her clinic, where staff is very gentle and friendly, process for appointment is very smooth and is handled very well, almost all your medical tests can happen in her clinic at decent rates, you never face any problem. Delivery, under her supervision,  was in Fortis, Vasant Kunj, which as well is a very nice, clean, maintained hospital with all required facilities.\n\nSo based on my experience and satisfaction, I am rating her highest, which anyway she deserves.",

She listens to your questions so calmly and patiently with a smile on her face that you never feel uncomfortable while asking her anything . You can call her anytime with any problem big or small and she always picks up the phone and addresses you by your name which gives such a personal and warmth touch to her already immensly professional and dignified approach towards her patients . She neither gives overly confident hopes nor does she scare you with even the slightest of negativities . She always goes at the right pace about her job . She coordinates very well with the radiologists which not other Doctors do and result in complications arising out of small things which could have been rectified earlier. I reside in Noida and going to her took about one hour each side but it was totally worth it as me and my husband knew we were in safe hands and thanks to God & Dr.Sutopa, I am a mother of a beautiful & lovely daughter.",

Your quiet confidence & compassion has changed all of our lives.\nI was so happy when I gave birth to my first born. I am relieved that we are safe in your hands. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Dr. Suttopa Banerjee. My baby\u2019s birth will always be remembered as a joyous memory, especially with a great doctor overlooking my pregnancy, labor and delivery.\"\nNo words are enough to appreciate the service you do.

She is very proactive and provides *** **** treatment available. In mid of my pregnancy I was low on haemoglobin for which she gave me iron through IV which made me feel energetic and also helped me post delivery.She has a truly calm and composed nature and would listen to all your queries with patience. She will make you feel so comfortable at the same time.I always looked upto to my appointments to meet her as it would give me loads of strength. Even after so many issues that I had, I have always hoped for a vaginal delivery and had mentioned this to her only once. Sutopa mam took a note of it and ensured that I had normal delivery. Along with her even her clinic staff and her Fortis hospital team are very compassionate and professional people.Even during the Covid times all the precautions were taken care of in the clinic.One of the highlights that she is always available (3 AM at night) on phone/whatsapp for any emergency.Thanks to Sutopa mam that I was able to deliver naturally even after so many complications. * **** ****** ***** *** *** ** *** ** *** **** ************* *** *** *** *****",

She has full clarity in her thoughts, which reflects in her advices which helped us to trust her and decide regarding our baby\u2019s delivery in Delhi itself. May God bless her and her family with all prosperity and happiness.\nIt\u2019s been 22 days, Suryansh has not let us sleep at all (in a good way \ud83d\ude0a). As any other expecting couple, it\u2019s a pursuit of happiness mixed with bouts of pain for any would be parents. We came across Dr. Sutopa Banerjee\u2019s clinic. After visiting her, she listened to us patiently, what our expectations were and asked us for some required tests and USG related to pregnancy confirmation. We did those tests and then after analyzing the all the test and USG report, we were informed that the child was not growing as should be and were advised some injections and medicines. We decided to stay back in Delhi and deliver our baby under her. It was not an easy decision for us. We were guided all throughout, at the time of my wife\u2019s dengue at the end of the 1st trimester, then at the time she suffered from cough and cold in the end of her 2nd trimester and near the end of her 3rd trimester, when her sugar level was fluctuating and was not under control due to her gestational diabetes. Dr. Sutopa asked us, if we wanted to stay on with the pregnancy or deliver through c-section, since as per her the baby was healthy and it was optimal time for delivery for both mother and the would be baby.\nWe had total faith in our doctor, hence we decided to go along with our doctor, which was one of the best decisions in our life. Hence after waiting for 38+ weeks under the guidance of Dr. Sutopa, we were blessed with a healthy baby boy through C-Section on 5th March, 2018.",

Throughout my pregnancy every now and then I faced issues but she was always gave me positive consultation and made me feel happy and stronger. Now I am blessed with a baby girl . She is one with positive attitude towards everything and makes her patients comfortable. It doesn\u2019t matter to her if it is a day or night she is always there whenever her patients need her.

Dr. Sutopa handled so well, even it was the peak Covid time, but she immediately made me admitted in the hospital and in the midnight she came for D&C which was really appreciated. Later on I consulted for infertility and further treatment and by god's grace and good treatment we are blessed with a baby boy via C section in this April. I would recommend Dr. Sutopa to everyone. Please have patience and faith of u r consulting her, and believe me u r in the good hands. ",

Her words are reassuring and her diagnostic processes are simple. Her personal assistant also very polite and handle the patients with ease. One of my friends is admitted in another hospital 15 days before for the same process I had, but she is still in the process of recovering even after a month and I got recovered much faster. All credit and all my gratitude goes to Dr. Banerjee.",

She has given us her advise through every step of our pregnancy journey, and advice which is valuable and important. She sets her expectations right from the very beginning and is very transparent in her dealings. The hospital staff at Fortis, where she is the Head of the Department also had very good things to say about her professionalism. \n\nThank you Dr Sutopa Banerjee for being a blessing in our lives and this new journey that we have undertaken.

Right from the second consultation visit, she made us feel like a part of the family. Guided us through the 9 months, during the delivery & now post delivery. The most striking feature apart from her med skills is her smile :). She will keep smiling while you ask questions/clear your doubts. Thats the doctor you want to have by your side during/after those 9 months. I would highly recommend Dr Sutopa because if & when I plan for the next child, I am for sure going to her.",

Not only did she patiently explain everything, but she also did not unnecessarily suggest IUI and IVF. My husband and I conceived naturally after trying for 10 years. I had a c section with her and it was extremely smooth- she was gentle and caring and did the surgery flawlessly. All my gynae check ups were done so gently, so well..I generally feel scared of Pap smears, pelvic check ups and in general was scared about pregnancy. But with dr Sutopa, it was such a smooth and lovely ride. I would highly recommend her. ",

Dr sutopa practices her profession with responsibility and does not take it as privilege only.

I have an existing condition of Rheumatoid arthritis also recently recovered from Covid. I also had a early miscarriage . She always listens to our concerns patiently. Sutopa mam has been very positive about my pregnancy ( 7 week) though I have had so many medication during covid infection. She does suggest so many tests , but we are okay with it as all the tests  are necessary. Generally other people don't do those tests , we are happy that we do .Hoping to deliver a healthy baby under her guidance . ",

To add to my problems and to make things more problematic, I was diagnosed with few health issues that hampers the baby\u2019s development. Despite having all these complications and very less time to treat, through her guidance, aid, support and by taking right decisions at right time with her help I was able to give birth to a very healthy baby.\nI am very pleased and happy to leverage this platform in thanking you Doctor Sutopa for all of your efforts that you have put on in adding a new life to our family.

But Dr. Sutopa Banerjee's care and guidance made it all a very warm, delightful and memorable experience for me, which culminated in a normal delivery a few weeks ago. Dr. Sutopa's rich expertise and compassionate approach towards her patients reflected consistently; she made us feel positive and confident at every stage of my pregnancy. At the same time, she was also being transparent, without losing her sensitivity for a moment, about what is realistic to expect and pursue. The confidence I gained from her care and guidance has definitely helped me a lot during my pregnancy and finally in the delivery. Both I and my partner are indebted to her for the way she has guided me into becoming a mother. Thank you so much, Ma'am!",

There are many good doctors in Delhi but i am sure there wont be any great human being like her. She is gem of a person, always smiling, very patient to listen to all our concerns. The whole 10 months of journey from getting pregnant to becoming parents of a little angel would not have been so smooth without maam's support & guidance. Also the clinic is pretty clean and well maintained, staffs are very nice, polite and professional. Words are little to express our gratitude. ",

We really enjoyed the overall experience as she is a lovely person and a great great doctor. All thanks to her we were blessed with a baby girl!!\n\nI would highly recommend all expecting mothers to come to her - am sure you will have a great experience like us.\n\nP.s -the staff is also very friendly and polite.

I had visited many gynaecologists and gastroentrolist (thinking the pain may be because of irritable bowel syndrome) before her but no one was able to identify the root cause of the pain.\nI visited doctor Sutopa after reading online reviews and my experience with her has been great. She recommended appropriate tests and was able to identify a huge cyst in my right ovary which was around 15 X 15 cm which could have led to serious complications, there was cyst in my left ovary as well. \nShe suggested for laparoscopic surgery at the earliest and was successful in removing the huge cysts from both the ovaries through laparoscopy. Usually these huge cyst require laparotomy but Dr Sutopa with her great expertise was able to remove it through laparoscopy.\nI strongly recommend Dr Sutopa for all Gynae issues related to endometriosis/pcos/pcod/pregnancy/vaginal problems etc. She is very polite and humble doctor who gives ample time to her patients to discuss about their issues.\nShe truly justify her Clinic's title 'Complete Care For Women\u2019.\nThank you Dr. Sutopa and her staff for taking complete care of me",

Whenever, I was nervous, at that time Dr Sutopa was guided to me either telephonically or video conferencing and satisfied to me.\n\n\tFinally, on 04 May 2020 at about 1453 hrs, I was very smoothly operated by Dr Sutopa and got a lovely Baby (Boy).\n\n\tAs my treatment experience, Dr Sutopa's clinical idea as well as her behavior is unexpected, unbelievable and excellent.

From our first meeting Dr Banerjee put us at ease and provided the same level of care, if not better, than what we had experienced abroad. She ably guided us through the entire nine months, advising on nutrition and supplements and encouraging me to remain active. When the time came the labour progressed smoothly and I was on track for a normal delivery but then complications arose when the baby became stuck and the doctor took the decision to deliver through caesarean as the child was in distress. Now barely six weeks later the baby thankfully is healthy and I have fully recovered from the operation and am back to my normal routine - running after a three-year-old and caring for an infant.\nToday Dr Banerjee has become not only our go-to person but a friend, and a professional who always puts her patients first - a quality which anyone who has met her will surely attest to.

She has been my pillar of strength during and after my pregnancy as we were very anxious after our first one being a miscarraige.  We liked the way she treated, guided and helped us during the ups and downs during pregnancy which i now realise how precious and rarity it is today. She always explained every aspect in detail and replied to our queries through whatsapp/sms at odd hours and emergencies. She always discussed and involved us in the planning, execution and considered our requests for amendments. We have seen her as a calm, composed and straightforward professional. Everytime we met her she approached us with a plan and timeline of the tests/activities to be carried out. \n\nWe are greatly indebted to her for safe, troublefree and a great experience    of our first pregnancy. We alongwith our baby boy Samar are really thankful to you doctor. ** **** *** *** ******* ** ******* **** *** may god help you in helping maximum number of people **** **** ********* *** ****** \n",

Extremely sweet in her approach, she made me feel very comfortable in probably the most uncomfortable time for my body. One of the best things about her is that her approach does not include a lot of things that are fads. She took care of me enough to enable me to travel in all my three trimesters. The one thing that most stands out about her is her approach to delivery. She patiently waited through over 20 hours of my labor on a Sunday to ensure that I delivered normally, a rare thing to see or hear among peers. I finally had a healthy baby boy thanks to her care and\n guidance. Many thanks. ",

I had gestational diabetes in my last trimester but she guided me very well and my delivery went very smooth. \n\nDr supota is a very friendly, polite and extremly efficient gynae... She was very loving and supportive till my delivery.  Best thing i like about her is dat  she would answer my call anytime. Even when she was busy, she used to call back asap.\n I am glad i found someone like her. I would strongly recommend Dr. Sutopa to all would be mothers.",

We have been a regular to her for the last almost four years and she is now like a part of our family. While I was slowly losingbhope of having a baby of my own, she never have up on me.

She stood there like a mother and being the professional that she is not even once she tried to influence my decision on how I want to deliver my child. \nI can go on and on but I would highly recommend Dr. Sutopa to my friend and family. She is definitely one of the best in her field. During pregnancy and after the baby came she provided all the help and support. Really thankful and blessed",

You have paid only Rs.5440 at our clinic for 6 visits (we have all records of your bills). You visited me 1st time on 10th Dec 2016 with long term health problem and was put on corrective medications. You never came back for a follow up thereafter.\nRegarding medicines, you were prescribed simple and widely available medicines.\nGiving a negative feedback after almost 9-10 months of the visits itself suggests that it is ill-intentional.\nYou have not got results because you were impatient and expected unrealistic results in a very short time.\nMy best wishes are there for you to become a mother.",

As far as my consultation with you is concerned, it is completely your opinion. But to my understanding, if I have advised 4 tests and 3 out of them have come abnormal, my diagnosis about your problem has been pretty right. Even after commenting so bad about me and my clinic at multiple sites, you kept asking treatment solution over free consult. I patiently answered all your queries whatever was possible on a chat and asked you to come for a free followup which is applicable for the next 5 days according to the clinic policy. But, you refused to come. Nothing seems to satisfy you. I hope you get satisfactory treatment elsewhere and get well soon.",

The clinic is absolutely clean, the staff is very professional and Doctor herself is great! She makes sure her patients are comfortable and feel safe in her hands, which I believe is the first job of every doctor, she's non judgmental, caring and very kind hearted person, these are the qualities women, specially young women look for in their Doctors. I'm forever grateful to her for looking after me and taking care of all my issues. I have grown from a girl of 23 years to now a woman of 27 years in front of her and she's helped me at every little and big step.Thank you, Doctor!words aren't enough to do justice to your support and treatments.",

Other doctors simply treat their patients with medicines but forget to do the most important thing which you do \u2013 help them to motivating words and inspirational thoughts. If every doctor strives to be as caring and generous as you, the world would be filled with smiles and laughter.\n\nThanks for everything Mam - Our Sutopa Didi :) :)",

You also forgot that your test results were abnormal for which I prescribed you medicines.\nAnd finally you put allegation on me of not treating your actual problems which were related to long term nutritional deficiencies and hormonal issues without giving enough time for the results to come.\nThis is intentional defaming somebody on internet!\nStill I like to wish you good luck and good health.\nDr. Sutopa Banerjee",

We keep all computerized records of your check in & check out timings.\nAs far as wastage of time is concerned, you have already wasted 4 precious months of your pregnancy without any treatment as it was the first time you were visiting a doctor, even being in the capital of India.\nRegarding paying Rs.800 and not getting satisfied with consultation, I am here to guide you and not to please you and boost up your ignorance.\nTo get good results you should be receptive to good advice rather than criticizing unnecessarily.",

I doubt if that time you recommended me to anyone for the good treatment that I gave you or gave a positive review to help others find a good doctor.\nThe second time you visited me 6 months later for treatment for a new episode of problem , as anybody else would do if only one had a good experience with me and not jut because of mere reviews. Had you not liked my treatment earlier you wouldn\u2019t have visited me again I presume.\nA mere consultation fee and 2 culture tests which were necessary for your diagnosis has burnt your pocket and has put a question mark on a doctor\u2019s intentions of curing a patient. \nTo add to it you didn\u2019t even come back for a follow up after completion of your medicines or inform me of any issues if you were facing in the meantime. Had you had contacted me I would\u2019ve surely helped you.\nI hope the readers decide by their own judgement if they would like to visit me after going through my reply to your comments.",

But I regularly reply to my patient's doubts .  \nYou and your wife visited me for the whole 9 months of your pregnancy (11 times as per PRACTO records) and never found me rude and unjustified in my treatment! \nBut in the last moment despite my repeated suggestions, you did not admit your wife to the hospital until she leaked for long 18 hours at home with all liquor drained out. There was no progress of labor and signs of developing infection had set in.
