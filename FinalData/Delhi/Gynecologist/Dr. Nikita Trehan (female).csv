"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hysterectomy (Abdominal/Vaginal),",0,0,YES,"I recently had surgery at Sunrise Hospital under the care of Dr. Nikita Trehan, and I am incredibly grateful for the exceptional treatment I received. Dr. Trehan is confident and highly skilled, and she saved my kidney, essentially saving my life. She dedicated ample time to explain every detail and potential consequence of the surgery, both pre and post-operation, which provided me with great comfort and reassurance.

The staff at Sunrise Hospital were generous and courteous, making my experience as smooth as possible. Their professionalism and kindness were evident throughout my entire stay.

While the charges were higher than anticipated, the quality of care was undoubtedly worth it. Dr. Trehan’s focused and meticulous approach made all the difference. I highly recommend Dr. Nikita Trehan and Sunrise Hospital for anyone seeking top-notch medical care",2024-05-25 08:06:27,False,True,user,,,

None,"Ovarian Cysts,",0,0,NO,"All she cares about is money. she decided to do my surgery and remove my ovary in 5 minutes of meeting me. she was not interested in knowing any of my medical history. She wanted to do the surgery the next morning itself and freaked me out, instead of pacifying me as she wanted to shell out 5lac from a simple procedure asap. On top of that she came 2hours late and met me only for 5 minutes. she insisted on getting it done the next day itself. it was not a good feeling that a doctor is not trying to comfort the patient but scaring the hell out of me.
I do not recommend this hospital or doctor.",2016-09-30 04:05:35,False,False,Sonakshi,,,
