"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hysterectomy (Abdominal/Vaginal),",0,0,YES,"I recently had surgery at Sunrise Hospital under the care of Dr. Nikita Trehan, and I am incredibly grateful for the exceptional treatment I received. Dr. Trehan is confident and highly skilled, and she saved my kidney, essentially saving my life. She dedicated ample time to explain every detail and potential consequence of the surgery, both pre and post-operation, which provided me with great comfort and reassurance.

The staff at Sunrise Hospital were generous and courteous, making my experience as smooth as possible. Their professionalism and kindness were evident throughout my entire stay.

While the charges were higher than anticipated, the quality of care was undoubtedly worth it. Dr. Trehan’s focused and meticulous approach made all the difference.
