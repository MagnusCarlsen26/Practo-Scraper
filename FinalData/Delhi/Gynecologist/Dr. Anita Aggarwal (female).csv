"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"
It was precious pregnancy so i had numerous questions at every stage.
Choosing to go with Dr. Anita Aggarwal was one of the best decisions I took during my pregnancy. She is Polite and friendly, Dr. Anita Aggarwal attended to all my queries and doubts throughout my pregnancy just as a mother would do. She really cared and concerned about me (literally too much even though my case had got complicated from 6th month due to diabetes , high liver infection, high bile acid etc. )  From the smallest to the biggest of my problems, her compassion and love has always taken half my problem away.  I had decided that she will be my doctor for life.
When I visited you first I was relaxed that I am in  safe  hands.
I would highly recommend her to all would-be-mothers.

Thanks maâ€™am for everything and my BUNDLE OF JOY ðŸ˜Š.",2019-12-28 20:41:56,False,True,Shalu sharma,,,
