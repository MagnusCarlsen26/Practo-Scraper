Wonderful Experience with Doctor Puja Sharma.
We are under consultation of Doctor Puja since 2019, earlier that year, we lost our first child after 12 days of her delivery, as she was suffering with a rare medical condition called TEF.
Doctor Puja gave both of us, hope and strength and we planned our second child under her consultation.
We strictly followed all the advises, medicines and tests as prescribed and last month we are blessed with a beautiful & healthy baby girl.
The second pregnancy was also very challenging as my wife had a RH-ve blood group and thyroid, also the c section surgery was also very tough due to previous conditions, she managed us to overcome all these challenges with her personal attention.
