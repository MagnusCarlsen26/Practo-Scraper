"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,*** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** ****** I was suffering from heavy menstruation problems and it was diagnosed as a PCOD problem by my previous doctor and I took treatment for more than 6 months regularly but symptoms get controlled by taking medication only if I didn't take the medicine then automatically it starts bleeding. Because of this I need to take the hormonal medicines for every 2-3 months interval. But luckily after a long wait of 3 year I meet Dr Tripti through practo and she solved my problem just within a month. At 1st visit she told me it's not a problem of PCOD because my symptoms is totally different from this condition so that she advised me some procedure with different cost which is very important for my problems and asked me to choose whichever is convenient for me. I choose one on my 2nd visit and procedure was done on next day(26/04/18). Since then I don't have any problems like before. It's really amazing and magical. I wish I could have meet her before.
