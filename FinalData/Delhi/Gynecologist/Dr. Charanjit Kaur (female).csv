,,0,0,YES,My experience with Dr. Charanjit has been absolutely wonderful. *** ** **** ************* *** gives advice with the intention of wanting the best for her patients. She is very caring towards her patients. She doesn't beat around the bush and is clear in her treatment strategies. I love the personal connect she brings to the appointment. She has always given me ample amount of time to explain my issues and is very patient. She is a wonderful doctor professionally as well as a wonderful human being. I would highly recommend her.,2021-09-04 14:38:18,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
