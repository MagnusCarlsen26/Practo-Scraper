She is experienced and caring. From pre surgery to post surgery, she is always available with expert advice. One of the rarest things which i have never seen in my life is that upon discharge after surgery she used to check daily about health and vitals of the patient ( my mother ) first thing in the morning.  Yes, you read it right !! My mother is a high- risk patient, but Dr Lalita onboarded the required specialists to get their opinion . Proper due diligence was done to make sure that my mother gets the best treatment . She is recovering well and on her path to being normal. Thank you so much, doctor.  ",

She is rude with her words and kept scolding my sister during whole questioning session as my sister gets anxious around new people especially new doctors. For the second appointment a week later that only lasted 4 minutes they made us wait 1.5 hour even though I had already booked appointment a week earlier and I came pretty early so also made the payment earlier. She kept calling patients after patients even though we were the first to book the appointment. *** ** *** *** ******* * *** ** *** ******** **** ****** *** ***** ******* * **** *** *********** **** *** ****** ****** *** ****** ",
