My treatment continued for total 8 months and I was out of the treatment. My everything was going very smoothly for 3 years. 

Then my marriage fixed so 6 months before I visited to Dr. SHABNAM, as she advised me this. I did PCOS tests again. My all the things were normal. After marriage she advised me to immediately plan 1 baby, so I did the same. In 4 months of marriage I was pregnant.
