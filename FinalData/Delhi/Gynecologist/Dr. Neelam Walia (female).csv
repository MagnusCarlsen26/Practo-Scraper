Would like to address your concerns here:-
Due to the ongoing pandemic the Doctor allows only the patient into her chamber.
Patient’s attendant is allowed to have a conversation with the doctor after the consultation is over. 
Sincere Apologies if you felt that the Doctor’s tone wasn’t polite though the Doctor never speaks in a rude manner with any Patient.
The Doctor has to go through everything in detail without hurrying and advise the patient accordingly.
Doctor has to correlate the patient’s ultrasound and other report findings to reach a conclusion and start the treatment accordingly.
Hope have been able to address the concerns raised by you.
