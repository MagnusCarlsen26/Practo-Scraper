"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"I read the reviews on Practo and decided to go for Dr Walia. However, our experience was not good at all. A typical doctor friendliness was missing. When I tried to join my wife during consultation she asked me to stay outside in what sounded like a rough tone. Even the whole consultation with my Wife was not very satisfying. All the time it seemed like Dr Walia was trying to figure out the issue. She has a long experience *** ***** ** ****** *** **** *** **** ** *** **** Nevertheless, we have decided not to consult with her again after this experience. ",2021-01-22 19:48:48,False,False,Verified Patient,"Appreciate your effort and time to post a feedback.
Would like to address your concerns here:-
Due to the ongoing pandemic the Doctor allows only the patient into her chamber.
Patientâ€™s attendant is allowed to have a conversation with the doctor after the consultation is over. 
Sincere Apologies if you felt that the Doctorâ€™s tone wasnâ€™t polite though the Doctor never speaks in a rude manner with any Patient.
The Doctor has to go through everything in detail without hurrying and advise the patient accordingly.
Doctor has to correlate the patientâ€™s ultrasound and other report findings to reach a conclusion and start the treatment accordingly.
Hope have been able to address the concerns raised by you.

Thank you
Regards
Dr Walia",2021-01-24T08:31:58+0000,Dr. Neelam Walia
