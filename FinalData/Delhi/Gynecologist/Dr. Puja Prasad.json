All reviews were full of praises and appreciations for Ma'am.. \nAs it was our third trimester, we knew we were quite late in meeting with Ma'am, but we decided to visit Ma'am and our first appointment with Ma'am was really really amazing.. Ma'am is so calm, polite and soft spoken.. Ma'am understood our problem of meeting her in third trimester and thoroughly listened to our concerns like a friend and prescribed appropriate tests and medications..  \nSo our wonderful journey with Ma'am started and we kept looking for our appointments with Ma'am as Ma'am clarified our every single doubt and explained everything in so simple & uncomplicated way..\nMa'am never prescribes any unnecessary test or medications.. \nUnder her supervision, our pregnancy period went so smoothly and tranquilly... \nPuja Ma'am was always there on phone and Whatsapp whenever we had any concern or doubt.. and even in COVID atmosphere, Puja Ma'am examined me properly on every visit.. \n\nWe were so anxious about delivery and desired a normal delivery and Ma'am also supported us for the same.. Moreover at delivery time, Ma'am kept us motivating for normal delivery till the end even when we were unsure about it.. By God's grace and just because of Ma'am, we had our little one delivered via normal delivery... We can't thank Ma'am enough for her efforts.. Ma'am was on fast on our delivery day and even then Ma'am was with us the whole time.. Thank you sooooo much Puja Ma'am... We will be forever grateful to Ma'am..",

All reviews were full of praises and appreciations for Ma'am.. \nAs it was our third trimester, we knew we were quite late in meeting with Ma'am, but we decided to visit Ma'am and our first appointment with Ma'am was really really amazing.. Ma'am is so calm, polite and soft spoken.. Ma'am understood our problem of meeting her in third trimester and thoroughly listened to our concerns like a friend and prescribed appropriate tests and medications..  \nSo our wonderful journey with Ma'am started and we kept looking for our appointments with Ma'am as Ma'am clarified our every single doubt and explained everything in so simple & uncomplicated way..\nMa'am never prescribes any unnecessary test or medications.. \nUnder her supervision, our pregnancy period went so smoothly and tranquilly... \nPuja Ma'am was always there on phone and Whatsapp whenever we had any concern or doubt.. and even in COVID atmosphere, Puja Ma'am examined me properly on every visit.. \n\nWe were so anxious about delivery and desired a normal delivery and Ma'am also supported us for the same.. Moreover at delivery time, Ma'am kept us motivating for normal delivery till the end even when we were unsure about it.. By God's grace and just because of Ma'am, we had our little one delivered via normal delivery... We can't thank Ma'am enough for her efforts.. Ma'am was on fast on our delivery day and even then Ma'am was with us the whole time.. Thank you sooooo much Puja Ma'am... We will be forever grateful to Ma'am..",

Though the baby was positioned breach and I had to get him delivered though cesarean procedure, the healing and guidance by Dr Puja made it so much easier for me. *** ** *** ** *** **** ************ ** *** ***** She is someone who will always recommend natural ways of healing, treatment and will never prescribe a long list of medicines. She is very open and honest and discusses the issues/challenges in details. He aura and nature is such that you instantly feel connected and better after meeting her.\n\nThank you so much ma\u2019am for everything you have done...\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

Ma'am is so calm,polite and soft spoken .Under her supervision  our pregnancy period went so smoothly .Puja ma'am was always there on phone and  what's app. whenever we had any concerns or doubts. It's rare to find a doctor that combines  such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. she never gives so many medicine. She's like an elder sister  to me \u2764. we are  blessed  to  have  our little princess \ud83d\udc78 our angel \ud83d\ude07 under her supervision. we are  satisfied with her treatment. Words are less  to thank you ma'am. Lots of love \u2764",
