"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,Wait time,","Vaginal Infection Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I went to consult doctor within weak since I had not to pay fee. But doctor told me that if she examine my physique then I would have to pay fee .I  asked her if she accepted payment through online mediums or debit card. She said they only accept cash. I had the prescription in my hand and told her that I will go to the ATM and just get back. To which, Dr Gurmeet Singh forcibly took the prescription from my hand and asked us to first get the money and pay her fees. We felt really awkward and insulted. This kind of ***** behaviour is not expected",2020-02-08 14:36:21,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
