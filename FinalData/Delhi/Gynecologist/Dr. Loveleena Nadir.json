Pregnancy is a journey full of excitement yet challenging for every woman and finding the right gynaecologist makes the journey smoother.\nWhile the transition to parenthood comes with new challenges, it has been a DELIGHTFUL experience to be treated by  Dr.Loveleena Nadir at Fortis La Femme.  My experience from the start has been in one word \u2018AWESOME\u2019.\nFrom our very first visit to Dr. Nadir at the hospital, we were welcomed with a broad smile, positive energy and loads of enthusiasm. Her distinguished aura was extremely soothing and maternal as we were made to feel very comfortable while she took the time to explain everything well and answered all our queries patiently. She gave us a lot of her valuable inputs on what was lying ahead of us and explained major milestones during our journey which instilled the faith in us putting all our fears to rest. We came out of her chamber feeling extremely happy, confident and sure that the quest for our best healthcare provider ends with her. \n\nDr. Loveleena Nadir is a miracle in the field of medicine with an extensive experience and unparalleled commitment which is definitely unmatched. She is the perfect blend of a highly competent medical professional and a compassionate human being. She is an extremely confident, proficient and highly qualified gynaecologist & obstetrician, who was always very approachable and meticulously gave us very actionable advice through each step. Her practical, flexible and reasonable approach gave us the reassurance that everything was going well during our journey. I had an exhilarating and a very soul satisfying birth experience as I delivered my healthy daughter this February under the leadership and guidance of Dr. Loveleena. She prioritised the baby's health and growth and ensured that both the baby and myself were doing well before and after the pregnancy.\n\n\"Not all angels have wings some have stethoscopes\u201d, hence proved as Dr. Loveleena was truly an angel in disguise for us. As we hold our little girl in our arms, we feel immensely grateful and deeply thankful to Dr. Loveleena for making our journey a memorable one and shall strongly recommend her to all would- be -mothers for a happy and peaceful pregnancy journey and can assure that you would be in loving and capable hands!\n\n",

Even one gynae scared me and was not much confident of Hysteroscopic + Laproscopic Myomectomy as she said that fibroids are very abnormal and she had never encountered such case.The moment she asked me to get a second opinion, i was very much possessive of finding an expert who can assure me the recovery from this illness without loosing my fertility.I am an unmarried so didnt want to effect my fertility. Then Dr.Loveleena,who proved to be a gem.I would say that the moment i met her first time i made up my mind to return to her only.Only she came out to be an assuring and most trustworthy doc for the treatment and recovery from this illness which any patient would seek from his doc.Right from the day of admission till the day of discharge she helped and coordinated with us regarding all admission formalities,paperwork,reports,tests etc. On the day,while i was in the OT being prepped for the surgery she was there for giving me strength as i was extreme nervous and scared.She found lil complications during my surgery but the way she handled is really admirable.I would rather say she cares like a mother for her patients. Post surgery also she was very much watchful whether medicines are being administered on time to her patient or not.Well now i am in the recovery stage post surgery and till date i am doing well in this phase. I cant stop being grateful to such a great doc and wish her future endeavours.May you be blessed with the happiness and love that you have given to society! Hats off to you :)",

My mother was detected with a big dermoid cyst in her ovary. We visited numerous doctors but all of them told us that open surgery was the only option. We were scared because she already had one ovary removed earlier but it was a painful experience at that time. Then we came to know about Dr. Loveleena and decided to visit her.She looked into the details of the case and told us that her team can do the same surgery with Laproscopy as her team has a lot of experience in laproscopy and they have the advanced tools for doing that. We were highly relieved with the confidence that she had shown from the first day. We decided to give it a go. On the day of surgery, everything went smoothly and her laproscopic surgery was complete in 2-3 hours without any complications. She recovered quite well and was discharged within 2-3 days. Dr. Loveleena guided us during the whole process. We are quite happy with the way the whole surgery was done and how fast she recovered.Thanks a lot Dr. Loveleena. Highly recommended!! ",

From the first time we met her till after she delivered our twins, she has been a ray of positivity. She always guided us correctly and always wanted us to be treated and looked after by the best people in the field. My entire journey from infertility to ivf to pregnancy and finally to delivery was guided perfectly by Dr Loveleena. Even though she referred me to Dr Sunita Arora for the actual IVF procedure, she constantly kept a check on my progress. And l was more than happy to be referred back to Dr Loveleena as my primary gynaecologist. Today as l rock my perfectly healthy twins l am eternally grateful to Dr Loveleena for an amazing pregnancy and delivery experience. She goes out of the way to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. Always a phone call or text message away, highly prompt, efficient and up to date with all the latest information, Dr Loveleena is definitely my recommendation to anyone pregnant or planning to conceive.

She was a great support for me from the start. At first, my pregnancy progressed normally however in the mid of my pregnancy I started having major complications. Dr Loveleena managed all my complications with utmost expertise and experience. She has great intuition and goes with her gut. She is a very positive doctor and is always just a call or whatsapp away. Even in the middle of the night she is available and responds with the most care. Her aura is very soothing and maternal and makes you feel very comfortable. Her experience in her field is definitely unmatched because she was always right about almost everything related to my pregnancy complications. She never gave up on me and my baby and made sure that I delivered a healthy baby at the end. I am thankful to her for delivering my beautiful daughter because if she wasn\u2019t my doctor, I don\u2019t think I would have been able to reach the stage of delivery due to all my pregnancy complications. She has been a real angel in disguise for me and I cannot recommend her enough. Not just me, but my entire family is very happy with her! ***** ********** *** ***** ",

Dr. Nadir has been my doctor since I was 15, so naturally I consulted with her even though I currently live in Hong Kong. On her advice, I got the tests \u2013 MRI and PET Scan done to verify whether the fibroid was malignant. While I was worried about the possibility of cancer, I was constantly in touch with Dr. Nadir and followed her advice to get the marker blood test done. After the PET scan and blood test marker were clear, I decided to get the fibroid removed (myomectomy) with Dr. Nadir. No other doctor in Hong Kong was willing to do the myomectomy laparoscopically because of the huge size of the fibroid. \nSo, I flew to India to get my surgery done under the very experienced hands of Dr. Nadir. The best part of going through her is that she makes you feel comfortable, explains what\u2019s going on scientifically, is trustworthy and takes care of every small detail so you have a worry-free surgery. \nI am so grateful to Dr. Loveleena Nadir for the personal care and excellent treatment during my laparoscopic myomectomy surgery.  \n",

The next thought which strikes your mind once you see something like this is bundles of negative thoughts... regular doctor visits, chemotherapy and what not. Finding a good & trustworthy doctor to show right path was very important . I feel blessed that I knew Dr Loveleena and then next thing to do was to call her rather than sink in negative thoughts. She pepped me and advised to do follow-up test and luckily the reason for high range was not cancer but endometriosis cyst. It bought such a relief to me and my  family members. Since then she guided me through the right treatment. She gave me confidence that it is normal case and with medication things will be better. Through out the treatment she was just a call away, always ready to motivate and say \"don't worry you will be fine\".. She carries such pleasing good vibes that you feel 50% recovered by seeing her ... I owe Big Thank you to you Dr Loveleena. Wish you good health and always be in high spirits. :) ",

Pregnancy is a journey full of excitement yet challenging for every woman and finding the right gynaecologist makes the journey smoother.\nWhile the transition to parenthood comes with new challenges, it has been a DELIGHTFUL experience to be treated by  Dr.Loveleena Nadir at Fortis La Femme.  My experience from the start has been in one word \u2018AWESOME\u2019.\nFrom our very first visit to Dr. Nadir at the hospital, we were welcomed with a broad smile, positive energy and loads of enthusiasm. Her distinguished aura was extremely soothing and maternal as we were made to feel very comfortable while she took the time to explain everything well and answered all our queries patiently. She gave us a lot of her valuable inputs on what was lying ahead of us and explained major milestones during our journey which instilled the faith in us putting all our fears to rest. We came out of her chamber feeling extremely happy, confident and sure that the quest for our best healthcare provider ends with her. \n\nDr. Loveleena Nadir is a miracle in the field of medicine with an extensive experience and unparalleled commitment which is definitely unmatched. She is the perfect blend of a highly competent medical professional and a compassionate human being. She is an extremely confident, proficient and highly qualified gynaecologist & obstetrician, who was always very approachable and meticulously gave us very actionable advice through each step. Her practical, flexible and reasonable approach gave us the reassurance that everything was going well during our journey. I had an exhilarating and a very soul satisfying birth experience as I delivered my healthy daughter this February under the leadership and guidance of Dr. Loveleena. She prioritised the baby's health and growth and ensured that both the baby and myself were doing well before and after the pregnancy.\n\n\"Not all angels have wings some have stethoscopes\u201d, hence proved as Dr. Loveleena was truly an angel in disguise for us. As we hold our little girl in our arms, we feel immensely grateful and deeply thankful to Dr. Loveleena for making our journey a memorable one and shall strongly recommend her to all would- be -mothers for a happy and peaceful pregnancy journey and can assure that you would be in loving and capable hands!\n\n",

Even one gynae scared me and was not much confident of Hysteroscopic + Laproscopic Myomectomy as she said that fibroids are very abnormal and she had never encountered such case.The moment she asked me to get a second opinion, i was very much possessive of finding an expert who can assure me the recovery from this illness without loosing my fertility.I am an unmarried so didnt want to effect my fertility. Then Dr.Loveleena,who proved to be a gem.I would say that the moment i met her first time i made up my mind to return to her only.Only she came out to be an assuring and most trustworthy doc for the treatment and recovery from this illness which any patient would seek from his doc.Right from the day of admission till the day of discharge she helped and coordinated with us regarding all admission formalities,paperwork,reports,tests etc. On the day,while i was in the OT being prepped for the surgery she was there for giving me strength as i was extreme nervous and scared.She found lil complications during my surgery but the way she handled is really admirable.I would rather say she cares like a mother for her patients. Post surgery also she was very much watchful whether medicines are being administered on time to her patient or not.Well now i am in the recovery stage post surgery and till date i am doing well in this phase. I cant stop being grateful to such a great doc and wish her future endeavours.May you be blessed with the happiness and love that you have given to society! Hats off to you :)",

My mother was detected with a big dermoid cyst in her ovary. We visited numerous doctors but all of them told us that open surgery was the only option. We were scared because she already had one ovary removed earlier but it was a painful experience at that time. Then we came to know about Dr. Loveleena and decided to visit her.She looked into the details of the case and told us that her team can do the same surgery with Laproscopy as her team has a lot of experience in laproscopy and they have the advanced tools for doing that. We were highly relieved with the confidence that she had shown from the first day. We decided to give it a go. On the day of surgery, everything went smoothly and her laproscopic surgery was complete in 2-3 hours without any complications. She recovered quite well and was discharged within 2-3 days. Dr. Loveleena guided us during the whole process. We are quite happy with the way the whole surgery was done and how fast she recovered.Thanks a lot Dr. Loveleena. Highly recommended!! ",

She always guided us correctly and always wanted us to be treated and looked after by the best people in the field. My entire journey from infertility to ivf to pregnancy and finally to delivery was guided perfectly by Dr Loveleena. Even though she referred me to Dr Sunita Arora for the actual IVF procedure, she constantly kept a check on my progress. And l was more than happy to be referred back to Dr Loveleena as my primary gynaecologist. Today as l rock my perfectly healthy twins l am eternally grateful to Dr Loveleena for an amazing pregnancy and delivery experience. She goes out of the way to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. Always a phone call or text message away, highly prompt, efficient and up to date with all the latest information, Dr Loveleena is definitely my recommendation to anyone pregnant or planning to conceive.

Dr. Nadir has been my doctor since I was 15, so naturally I consulted with her even though I currently live in Hong Kong. On her advice, I got the tests \u2013 MRI and PET Scan done to verify whether the fibroid was malignant. While I was worried about the possibility of cancer, I was constantly in touch with Dr. Nadir and followed her advice to get the marker blood test done. After the PET scan and blood test marker were clear, I decided to get the fibroid removed (myomectomy) with Dr. Nadir. No other doctor in Hong Kong was willing to do the myomectomy laparoscopically because of the huge size of the fibroid. \nSo, I flew to India to get my surgery done under the very experienced hands of Dr. Nadir. The best part of going through her is that she makes you feel comfortable, explains what\u2019s going on scientifically, is trustworthy and takes care of every small detail so you have a worry-free surgery. \nI am so grateful to Dr. Loveleena Nadir for the personal care and excellent treatment during my laparoscopic myomectomy surgery.  \n",

The next thought which strikes your mind once you see something like this is bundles of negative thoughts... regular doctor visits, chemotherapy and what not. Finding a good & trustworthy doctor to show right path was very important . I feel blessed that I knew Dr Loveleena and then next thing to do was to call her rather than sink in negative thoughts. She pepped me and advised to do follow-up test and luckily the reason for high range was not cancer but endometriosis cyst. It bought such a relief to me and my  family members. Since then she guided me through the right treatment. She gave me confidence that it is normal case and with medication things will be better. Through out the treatment she was just a call away, always ready to motivate and say \"don't worry you will be fine\".. She carries such pleasing good vibes that you feel 50% recovered by seeing her ... I owe Big Thank you to you Dr Loveleena. Wish you good health and always be in high spirits. :) ",

She addressed all issues irrespective of it being a small or big issue and was always quick to respond via call/whatsapp. At every appointment, she answered all our questions patiently and gave us very actionable advice.

She cleared our doubts and made us understand the significance of getting the surgery done ASAP. I got the surgery done two days before and doing absolutely fine. She went out of way to get the best facilities available for us at Fortis La femme and even paid multiple visits to my room despite her busy schedule for getting our billing sorted. I am only praise for her and highly recommend her to anybody reading this review. Thank you so much Dr. Loveleena for everything. ",

Got me through my 9 months beautifully and on the final day literally pushed me for a normal delivery which seemed pretty impossible once my contractions started. She  was there throughout my labour kept pushing me and motivating me with soo much Love and affection.  Proud to say that I dint need an epidural and had a smooth delivery.  \n",

Mine was a high risk pregnancy with multiple fibroids and one even partially obstructing for a C-section. Also since I am A-ve blood type, any wrong cut could have led to excessive bleeding and life threatening consequences.\n\nHowever, Dr. Loveleena had full patience and guided me throughout the process starting 3 weeks before the date of delivery. The timing of her decision to induce the pain was excellent and well thought out. \n\nDespite my fragile situation, she ensured that I had a perfectly normal delivery and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. I also did not need any blood transfusion and the fibroids were also excellently managed during delivery. \n\nThere are doctors who treat you and you become well and then there are doctors whom you meet and you become well because of their personality. Dr. Loveleena is the latter and her personality is such that anyone would feel a burst of positive energy when one meets her. \n\nHad it not been for her expertise, I would have been totally stressed out. I cannot thank her enough and cannot recommend her enough to everyone!!\n",
