She understood the problem in one go.. She clarified all our doubts and above all, i found her very down to earth person who realize that as patient we are worried about the situation and she explained in cool and calm way with all pro and cons.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Ovarian Cyst Removal,",0,0,YES,"The diagnosis was spot on from day 1 and the communication was extremely clear. She didn't use any unruly doctor jargons to complicate the understanding of my issue.

It was a pleasant experience frankly, my family or myself weren't worried about anything because of how professionally everything was handled by Dr.Kanika Batra Modi. She was nice, understanding & professional.

Thank you for your support!
