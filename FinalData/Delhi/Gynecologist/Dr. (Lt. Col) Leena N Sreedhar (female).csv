None,None,0,0,YES,"Dear All

I would like to pen down few words on our recent experience that we had with Apollo Craddle hospital and specially with the doctors in that hospital.  Coming back from a foreign land(out of India), we had a lot of experience in getting exposed to the services & environment of the hospitals and doctors, which are outside India. However coming back to home(in India) always brought us to the ground reality of limited services & options being available, when it comes to hospitalization. However we were completed concluded wrong when we visited the Apollo Cradle hospital.   
To me apart from the infrastructure (which also plays a huge part), I always believe that it is the people & ultimately the doctor that makes a difference when it comes to patient care and I am sure most of you would agree to it. In Apollo Cradle (Moti Nagar branch) the level of hospitality that I have seen has been at par with any other top hospital, atleast what I have experienced, outside India. The kindness and willingness to help that we saw with the staff in the hospital, was terrific and consistent with all the staff. So I think it was not an exception with any particular good staff that we met but that’s what they have been groomed with. 
Speaking about the doctor, we consulted Dr (Lt. Col)Leena Sreedhar and the more I write about her the more I feel Thankful to her for the care & support she gave to my wife during her pregnancy. Our first meeting with Dr Leena was good enough for us to make us believe that we are in the right caring hands. The unique nature which I would like to highlight of hers, is that she is equally or more concerned about the patient than the patient herself, which as a husband made me feel really nice and not alone in this critical phase of our life. The transparency and care that she showed in every gesture she performed whether that is talking to us or checking the patient or writing the prescription and explaining the same, made us build more confidence in her and in her ability/experience. Coming from an armed forces background, she has been equally clear, disciplined and focused when looking at her patients. I have witnessed it by myself by not just being in her office but also in the operation theater when my wife was getting operated. 
For obvious reasons of just being a spectator in the operation theater, I noticed how aligned her team was in the room, how organized every member of her team was in whichever task they were assigned to and most importantly, how much Dr Leena was in the control of the situation every second. Spectacularly her style, her nature and her approach has not changed ever since and even till today when we meet her she mirrors whatever I have indited about her above.
I would like all my good friends who are currently undergoing the same situation in their life which I was few months back(wife pregnant, all concerned about which best doctor to consult, best facility, good staff & great care), I would recommend you to please try and experience Apollo Cradle and meet Dr Leena. I am sure you would have more to add to what I have written about her & her team.
Thank You Dr Leena and her entire team for being there & never letting us feel that we are alone in this important phase of our life.

None,"Maternity,",0,0,YES,"Me and my wife consulted Dr. Leena N. Sreedhar. She is an excellent doctor and thanks to her we have a beautiful baby boy.

Let me share my experience in detail...

While considering a gyne & Ob, following were my criteria - 
1. My wife's comfort level with the doctor,
2. Doctor's education and prior experience (I prefer doctors having education from and experience in government institutes...and more the experience the better).

We consulted several doctors and all of them were friendly (actually generally all gyne are). However my wife was comfortable only with Dr. Sreedhar. Let me tell you, even my parents & in-laws  were impressed by her (and also listened to her advices....which is quite rare). She also clarified which practises (pre and post delivery) that our elders asks should be followed and which are the myths. She has also prepared a detailed booklet explaining almost everything that you need to know during pregnancy (problems, diet, weight, activities etc.) which she happily gives to her patients free of cost (this was very helpful).

Further, her education and experience also fit our requirements.

Hence, we decided to continue with her.

She listened to our each and every query very patiently, always gave us ample time (irrespective of number of patients waiting ....this we really admired in her) and explained everything to us with simplicity and in detail. One more thing...my wife didn't even felt the tetanus injection given by Dr. Sreedhar (these small things matter and increases your comfort and confidence in the doctor). She knows very well as to what should be stressed upon and what not. She is not like other doctors who scare you to death unnecessarily even for small things.

She never told us to get tests done or to come for a visit unnecessarily and knows VERY WELL what she is doing. She prefers normal delivery and gives her best to get this. She was very calm, understanding and helpful (even when I used to call her on her phone very frequently when the due date was near); and was always available when we needed her. 

I would recommend everyone in need to consult Dr. Sreedhar (believe me you would thank me for it).

Now, regarding Apollo Cradle Moti Nagar...the place is simply great...the ambience, cleanliness and staff...everything. The doctors that I experienced there (Dr. Arpita (Gy&Ob) and Dr. Avneet (Pediatrics)) were very good...and a special thanks to Dr. Chandrakanta (Physio...she worked very hard for over an hour to reduce the leg cramp pain my wife was experiencing during labor), Ms. Shikha (the RM... she was very friendly and helpful) and Daljeet (from the cleaning staff... who was also very kind). 

Further, when considering hospital for delivery, PLEASE ask previous patients regarding their experiences; as services provided post delivery by nurses, admin, cleaning staff etc. is equally important. All these services in Apollo Cradle Moti Nagar were more than satisfactory for us.

Hope this helps.",2016-01-22 09:04:08,False,True,User,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,NO,"*** ***** ******* ************* **** *** ** * ***** **** ** ************ **** ** ***** That the fact that we were regularly consulting her regarding abnormal bleeding that my wife was suffering yet she did not even once mention that my wife should do a pregnancy test even when, as we found out, all the signs were of a complication already present. She kept treating my wife for hormonal imbalance and it led to a situation where had it not been a stroke of rare luck, I would have lost my wife in the middle of a highway 200km away from our home. 
It was Dr, Leena Sridhar we had consulted all through our first pregnancy and we welcomed our daughter through a C-Section on July 11, 2021. After delivery her periods were regular but after 10 months she suffered with intense bleeding with clots, we immediately went to Dr. Leena and explained the status and she briefly mentioned about the hormonal changes that occur after pregnancy and also recommended to get few tests done along with ultrasound. On June 6, 2022, we showed the reports to Dr. Leena Sreedhar and she stuck to her diagnosis that it was a hormonal issue and treatable. Again, my wife asked for the pregnancy doubt, mentioned clots on which she mentioned that no it is because of the hormonal issues and all the reports are clear. She prescribed to continue the medication for hormonal issue only and visit again once the bleeding stops. But it didn’t stop despite taking the medicines. Trusting our doctor, we stayed on the medicines she had given us and while on the grounds the bleeding never stopped (spotting one day and heavy bleeding other days). But it was when we went a weekend trip to Jaipur, things started becoming more and more troublesome. My wife started suffering from more and more bleeding including the clots during the journey, but by the time we reached Jaipur, it had stopped, and we decided to wait for the night to see if it returned. Thankfully, the night went by somehow and the next morning, we immediately decided to head back to Delhi and visit Dr. Leena since the situation seemed abnormal. 
However, the next few hours turned out to be absolute nightmare to us, my wife had started bleeding profusely, and we rushed back towards delhi, however my wife had started to go unconcious due to all this bleeding and had it not been our extreme good luck of finding *** **** hospital nearby, my wife would have been dead. We had tried calling and sending pictures to her on whatsapp but her response was cold and not helpful at all. *** ***** ******* ********* **** ** **** ** ***** ** ***** ** *** ****** ** ********

If I have to describe her I will simply say ""She is God on Earth"" and I mean it from bottom of my heart. She is one person who can connect with all your problems and give a very comforting and realistic responses. 

Her knowledge is deep and she is extremely patient in answering all your worries on becoming a new mom. She is surely not of the money minded doctors who keeps asking you to visit them for every small things, rather she will educate you over the phone even at odd hours and ensure her paitents are comfortable. 

My family & friends say that I hardly praise anyone as it is difficult for anyone on earth to impress me and I feel proud in mentioning that I deeply respect Dr Leena for her hard work and commitment towards her profession and I am truly touched by her concerns and guidance. I TRUST HER BLINDLY AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND HER AS THE BEST GYANE DOCTOR. 

Thanks for delivering my bundle of joy safely in my arms. God bless u mam,

She came as a rescuer for me and enabled me to convert my high risk pregnancy at 39 years age to a low risk normal delivery. She is sound technically and will explain you logically without any sugar coating. She is straight forward whether things are positive or not positive but her intentions are to always make things right for you and I was well disciplined and compliant to her suggestions. She and her team and Heena the assistant are well coordinated. The only thing i found missing was non availability of her contact number outside of hospital visit, in case of any urgent queries..

None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Leena is an extremely humble and down to earth person. My hunt for a good and caring gyane ended when I met her. If I have to describe her I will simply say ""She is God on Earth"" and I mean it from bottom of my heart. She is one person who can connect with all your problems and give a very comforting and realistic responses. 

Her knowledge is deep and she is extremely patient in answering all your worries on becoming a new mom. She is surely not of the money minded doctors who keeps asking you to visit them for every small things, rather she will educate you over the phone even at odd hours and ensure her paitents are comfortable. 

My family & friends say that I hardly praise anyone as it is difficult for anyone on earth to impress me and I feel proud in mentioning that I deeply respect Dr Leena for her hard work and commitment towards her profession and I am truly touched by her concerns and guidance. I TRUST HER BLINDLY AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND HER AS THE BEST GYANE DOCTOR. 

Thanks for delivering my bundle of joy safely in my arms. God bless u mam, 

Thanks a ton.
