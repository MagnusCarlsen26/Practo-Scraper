Anxieties and expectations don't get the best out of us. When we decided to do the fertility treatment we were well aware of that. We knew that despite the way statistics looked, the process could go either way. After1 unsuccessful IVF and 2 failed Frozen embryo transfers in Canada, we felt quite disappointed. Thats when, one of our family members recommended Dr Simrandeep Kaur. 

Dr Simran is an outstanding professional and very hard working. She even sacrificed her Sunday mornings for us to make sure we are getting the very best treatment. She works tirelessly not just for us but for every other patient as well. The clinic is very well put together, the staff is very nice and supportive. 

Now My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and we are back in Canada. A very big Thank you to Dr. Simran and her team. Even though we are so far away from her but she is still available through various online channels to support us right away when we need to consult with her. 

I recommend Dr Simran 10000+ times. You will be in the best hands. Fertility treatment is the right mix of science and God's will. You can rely on Dr. Simran for the science part for sure!
