She is not only an intelligent doctor who gives medicinal treatment but a nice person also who gives personal attention to patients in urgent situations. Doctor is always available for her patients and takes regular update also in crucial situations. It was really surprising for me when I received a concern call from Doctor for my health update in one crucial situation in my 8th month.\nLast but not the least, staff of Doctor Nidhi clinic is also very humble and cooperative.\nThank you very much Doctor Nidhi for the quality treatment, guidance and concerns during my pregnancy journey.",

Dr Nidhi guided us well during our first pregnancy, she shared valuable information to ensure I have a safe pregnancy and have good strength and immunity during this important time. She is a doctor who can always be on your beck and call whenever you needed her support. Her advices have helped me have a smooth vaginal delivery too. She is more like a family for us now.",
