"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"*** ****** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** **** *** I started going to Dr. Tripat a year before I started planning a baby and it was the best choice I’ve ever made. 
Dr. Tripat's experience and methodical way of doing things makes her second to none. She is always so positive about everything (even if there is a problem) and as a patient that is an extremely re-assuring quality. She never passes on the stress of a situation to the patient and knows exactly how to deal with anything and everything. With Dr. Tripat there are no unnecessary problems and all genuine problems have a simple solution. Unlike most doctors today, Dr. Tripat will never make you do unnecessary tests or ultrasounds, unless they are really needed. Throughout my pregnancy I just had 3 ultrasounds and minimal number of routine blood tests (sugar, thyroid and other required tests). Dr. Tripat maybe arguably the busiest gynecologist in Delhi, however, she makes it a point to spend enough time with each and every patient. Dr. Tripat and Dr. Uma (Assistant Doctor) are also always available over the phone for urgent queries and help if needed.
I believe a gynecologist has to be friendly, approachable and mother-like and Dr. Tripat was more than all of that to me. I trusted her blindly and only did and did not do what she asked me to (I did not read google/BabyCenter or other apps to get answers to my questions).
I would recommend Dr.Tripat, no questions asked, to anyone. Thanks to Dr. Tripat, my pregnancy and delivery was extremely easy and one of the best experiences of my life.

She is a very reassuring  person by nature and you will confident in her care. During lockdown, she arranged for me to be admitted one day before due date since the covid situation was quite bad all around. I had a traumatic birth which started as an induced labor and ended with c section due to obstructed delivery. Her team at la femme is par excellent. Despite the pain I was in the doctors and nurses did everything they could to make me comfortable, were always cued in, very prompt, understanding and very competent.
