The moment I told her my periods were delayed and the self-pregnancy results were negative, she asked me if I'm married. I don't understand the relevance of that question. I said 'no' and she asked me to speak very softly, lest the people outside hear about my unforgivable crime. She spoke a little about birth control and gave me some pills for my periods. I felt so inhibited by then I could not bring myself to speak about my other health issues. She squared me up with a couple more judgmental glances before I left. 

I hope she's reading this and understands that as long as sex is a personal choice. The only thing that matters is whether is it consensual or not - both within or outside marriage. A doctor's job is to advise and treat, not push her own skewed morality on the patient.
