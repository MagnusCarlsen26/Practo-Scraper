Ma'am is very polite, give proper time for consultation and clear all the doubts until you feel confident. No unnecessary testing and reports.
During the pregnancy, everything was going well til 8th month but i was worried coz my wife have beta thalassemia, a Genetic disorder. and was in regular touch with Dr. We reported each and every symptoms during pregnancy and she cleared them very well.
In last month,my wife developed some symptoms which were not good for baby. She advised us to terminate pregnancy during 37th week and planed for early delivery. We were very tensed at the time she told us that but she gave us her full support and confidance for this.
Wife admitted to hospital at Madhukar rainbow on 21st Dec. First she tried for normal delivery for almost 20 Hr but findings were not good so we decided for C section after that i was blessed with a cute baby girlüòç.
Delivery was fine, since wife had lower hemoglobin, we Booked one unit of Blood but that was not required because operation was so fine that much bleeding was not there.
Today after 12 days, wife recover almost fully.

I am really lucky that Madhumita Mam was my choice by God's grace. I have seen doctors doing C-Sec delivery after trying for few hours if the patient gives up but Dr Madhumita is just the opposite. She will encourage you for normal delivery till the end and will keep you motivated so that you don't loose strength and hope. Mine was a high risk pregnancy and we faced various medical conditions right from 1st trimester to 3rd trimester but thanks to Madhumita Mam she handled my case so well.
Unlike other doctors who are least bothered about patients concerns and doubts, Dr Madhumita Patel always listens to her patients and clears each and every doubt. Despite of her busy schedule she is never in a hurry instead gives enough time to her each and every patient. She takes effort to explain the issue to patients, encourages them to read and research about the issue and then gives medical advice. She explains every vaccination and medicine before offering. The best part is that she is always available on WhatsApp and phone for any urgent issue. 
I have found such a nice connection with her now, I feel so friendly and homely by meeting her and talking to her. She is really a gem of a person. More than a doctor she has also helped me with my post natal concerns and problems which shows her generosity towards her patients. She not only guided me on how to take care of myself and my baby but also guided my family to understand  my concerns and help me with this tough phase when me and my baby both are adjusting in this new environment and new phase of life.
