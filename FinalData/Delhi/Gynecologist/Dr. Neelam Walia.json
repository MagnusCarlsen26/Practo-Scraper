Dr neelam never made me feel all these things were complicated only after i delivered she told me about all this. She prepared me very well for a normal delivery. With so many Complication other doctor would have recommended me casearian section whereas Dr neelam never insisted for it. She never lets you spend unnecessarily during your pregnancy period. She rather made my pregnancy journey experience very memorable. She is a no nonsense Doctor & very transparent with the patient who doesnt believe in ripping you off. I am further following up with her post delivery now and Truly recommend her.. All the best!",

It was a smooth sailing during my antenatal period. The best part of her is that she senses the problems very well and tries to rectify each problem. All went well and delivered a baby boy...

Not only did she listen to me but she also asked very pointed questions and not the way other doctors who i found judgemental she asked really specific questions about my medical records and history. She also was able to give me some definitive guidance and answers on things in a way no other doctor has.  She is very calm and soft-spoken. I went through the procedure smoothly & it was a pleasant experience.",

She was very friendly during the health check up . she didn't recommended any medicine or any test . It was great experience with her , I would recommend others too go there as she will not give unnecessary medicine or ask for test from outside . \n\nThank you !   ",

She patiently addressed all our queries & concerns. She handled the entire pregnancy period with full warmth and professional expertise. We highly recommend Dr Neelam for any Gynae and pregnancy issues.",
