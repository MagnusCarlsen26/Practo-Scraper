Dr Sutopa is a doctor with a magical touch. She is a brilliant medical professional and by nature she is very understanding and treats her patients very calmly and in a friendly manner. We have been consulting dr Sutopa since last 7years and since then , there has been no looking back. She has always been extremely supportive of our decisions and has always guided us with best possible solutions to our gynaec problems . 

My pregnancy journey started with few ups and downs as there were some complications. But dr sutopa guided me at every step of my pregnancy journey and helped me deliver a beautiful and healthy baby boy 2 months back and I cannot be more than grateful to dr Sutopa for making it happen so smoothly. 

We started with dr Sutopa from the day we started planning for a baby. She asked us to take few tests and also guided us to take pre-conception plan from curelinks . This really helped us conceive within 2 months of our visit to dr Sutopa. Once we conceived , we blindly followed her and did whatever was required to deliver a healthy baby. She was very polite and was always available on call to help us with smallest of the doubts. 

Her infectious smile is all that a person would need to make them feel good. After knowing her for so long, she is like a family to us and treats me like her sister . She has always been supportive and I can't think of anyone else for my gynae problems. I have even recommended her to my friends and family. All you need to do is trust her and she will take care of the rest.

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to mam and her team of doctors and support staff for giving us the most happiest and special moments our life .. May God bless you with good health and happiness and may you remain the source of happiness for many others just like us .

Me and my Wife's journey to become parents started in Feb, we rushed to nearest Gynecologist i.e. Nanda hospital Chhaterpur. Doctors in that hospital are really
good but we wanted someone that could provide us help and guidance in this journey off the clinic/hospital too whenever we are in need. I was really worried about
it and then I used Practo to find nearest gynecologist and shortlisted two but chose Dr. Sutopa due to her details and patient feedback. Obviosly not all feedbacks
are good but lets be honest one or two reviews doesn't help you pick or drop.

So we visited her then she explained things very nicely, we didn't have to ask her anything, it is like with her experience of more than 2 decades she know what 
could be the psyche of patient and what are their most probable concerns. With her first consulation we were happy but going forward I saw that she is writing many 
tests at every stage and also used to prescribe many medicines, at this stage you might discuss this with your friends and family, some of them surely will say this 
doctor is doing this for monetary benefit blah blah but trust me you need to TRUST Dr. Banerjee because this is what we did at every stage.

Like most of the people we also wanted Normal delivery but we will be honest we did not have too much confidence because my wife's pain threshold is very low and when 
due date was nearing we used to discuss this to make up our mind so that when time comes we don't get nervous or demotivated. We discussed this with doctor and she told us
we can decide if we want but we will wait till 40 weeks for normal delivery unless there is any complication found, and at this point i would like to highlight that she has
no agenda other than making sure Mother and Child both are safe and healthy. So if takes to write multiple tests or to prescribe medicines for mother, that looks
money making agenda to some people, she will do that. She is really SOFT SPOKEN and KIND but she wont let you take her lightly when comes to patient care. 

After waiting for 34 weeks there was Preterm labor and we were not happy because that means Mother and baby both will have to suffer but Dr. Sutopa made it go away
with immediate hospitalization of my wife and 2days of care, by the way she operates and delivers baby in Fortis hospital Vasant Kunj. And after waiting 3 more
weeks i.e. in 37 weeks 4days time came and we reached hospital and she saw my wife in labor and she knew about her pain threshold so she prescribed Epidural to ease with labor
but did not chose to do C-Section and with all these we saw our beautiful Girl Child and we were too happy as our WISH came TRUE.

With above story of more than 37 Weeks I would like to Suggest to try Dr. Sutopa Banerjee. Complete Care of Women with Warmth, Kindness.

Dr. Sutopa Banerjee my gynecologist showed up for me like an angel. Who made my experience at Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj a wonderful one.
Dr. Sutopa and her team are doing a great job at Fortis. Everyone was at their best, Dr. Sutopa is magical, no words to thank her enough. 
Also her PA is doing good work. The Labor room team, the nurses and the supporting staff all did their best, and are very professional.

I was happy with their services and returned home with my bundle of joy. 

Pregnancy Journey: 
My pregnancy journey was going smoothly until the 37th Week, everything was looking fine. I was very excited and fully prepared for the normal delivery. However, things changed overnight, we discovered on the 37th Week blood test, that I have a high risk pregnancy and I need to bring my baby out as soon as possible. As unexpected, not sure how to handle the situation, we were clueless on what action to take forward. Super stressful moments as my countdown was on. 
We re-discussed  the same with Dr. Sutopa. where she explains the current reality, possible circumstances, and available options and their possible 
consequences.  which certainly helped us to make the right decision at the right time. 

When I was in the Operation Theater I was extremely scared until I saw Dr. Sutopa. Everyone may have their own experiences of her. But for me the Aura that she carries to her profession is extreme - 
She stood there and did my delivery & operation just like a DEVI would have done. 

My family and I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Sutopa Banerjee and her team for their wonderful work.

She is extremely polite and friendly. She responded to each and every questions (no matter how silly it was :P) during face-to-face consultation or on whatsapp.

In my case, initially she wanted to wait for normal delivery but things became a bit critical at the end of my pregnancy. It was already full term and could have ended up in a bad way. Dr. Sutopa took the right call and suggested for immediate admission for a complete day for monitoring. We are blessed with a healthy baby girl and all thanks goes to her only. She is now helping me with post-pregnancy care as well.

Finally we are really thankful to all the staffs in the clinic. They are also extremely helpful. they guided us from booking appointments, to getting the medicines or getting the blood tested and it's all under one roof which made everything very easy for us. The clinic is tidy and clean.

Honestly, we have no words to explain, how much grateful we are to her. 

So thank you so much again, Dr. Sutopa, for making our dream come true. We highly recommend her for Obstetrician/ Gynecological issues.

We are thankful to Dr. sutopa mam for making our dream come true. During our difficult phase of life we have met lot of gynecologists but sutopa mam is exceptionally different no doubt she is the best among all of them.
During first consultation with mam, we were afraid and have lot of questions in mind she politely listened with patience and examine reports of past history. As it is a case of high risk pregnancy mam tackle our case with highest level of safety with all precautionary measures. She is extremely polite, soft-spoken and treats her patients like his own child. She is dat much worried as we are till the things become normal. After 6 months of pregnancy when there are no such complications mam still always keep an eye on each and everything and guide accordingly. 
Mam has such a pleasant smile  and soft spoken nature that once u meet her u will start feeling positive and complications will go on its own. At clinic everything is systematic and well managed. Mam will never hurry you u can ask as many questions u have in ur mind. U can only leave once u r completely satisfied and want to go out on ur own. 
During covid time when no doctor wants to investigate u physically she is d one who care for his patients and investigate u (if reqd.) by wearing all protective equipment’s.

All thanks to Doctor Sutopa Banerjee and her team. 
 
With experience of my pregnancy, I learnt that the three most important people during the pregnancy are parents to be and doctor. So strongly advise to the couples to spend good time and energy in selecting the doctor. But once you select the doctor, start trusting him/her for the best result.

Like most of the parents, we also wanted to have normal delivery and did lot of research in selecting the doctor.

After first few visits of the Dr. S. Banerjee, I came to understand that doctor plays important role in mode of delivery (only after mother), but it's further depends on many other factors of pregnancy. So best we can do is give our honest efforts and make best possible decision in various situations during the different phases of pregnancy.

Dr. S. Banerjee has strong hold on the subject. She listened all the concerns patiently and offered different options for what I could do. It happens too often that doctors make patients feel trapped into one decision, this was not the case with Dr. S. Banerjee. I really felt in control over the situation and was able to use her as an educated resource to help me make the best decision possible. 

One of many quality of Dr. S. Banerjee is she speak to the point and on right time which is very effective and helped us.

During my visits, I found that the staff is also very helpful and care a lot about patients.

Thereafter, journey of 9 months remained easy under expert guidance and supervision of Dr. S. Banerjee. Only thing I did was stayed positive, stress free and religiously followed the Doctor’s advice.

She was always available (even at late night hours), whenever we wanted a suggestion or clear our smallest doubt. As it was our first experience, we were extremely wary of everything & use to ask even the smallest things, but she was always patient enough to answer our weirdest queries.

Many people suggested us to switch our doctor, quoting that she is unnecessarily expensive, we stayed to her, coz we feel that without proper & regular check ups & medications, no one can access the growth of fetus. The final outcome has made our belief on her even more stronger & we r happy on our decision to continue with her.

We are visiting Dr. Sutopa since my wife and I started planning of having a new member in our family. We did lot of research on whom to consult, finally we got online reviews of Dr. Sutopa. We we're bit skeptical if there will be any issues or not. The moment we met doctor she was smiling and and positive about everything and prescribed some test. Where some tests were up and down but how she described it was amazing she said "" everything look fine yeh thoda sa badha hua hai koi baat nahi medicine de dedenge"". It was such a relief cause she handled it so humbly without creating any hype or panic.

It was a matter of max 30 mins procedure.

Dr. Sutopa asked us, if we wanted to stay on with the pregnancy or deliver through c-section, since as per her the baby was healthy and it was optimal time for delivery for both mother and the would be baby.

	Women’s Health Clinic is the single umbrella where whole types of test related with pregnancy as well as it's treatments are done and under the same umbrella, Dr Sutopa is treated to me very well.

	As the whole country as well as whole world is so panic and during the lockdown period due to pademic COVID-19 situation, Dr Sutopa treated to me very peacefully. Whenever, I was nervous, at that time Dr Sutopa was guided to me either telephonically or video conferencing and satisfied to me.

	Finally, on 04 May 2020 at about 1453 hrs, I was very smoothly operated by Dr Sutopa and got a lovely Baby (Boy).

	As my treatment experience, Dr Sutopa's clinical idea as well as her behavior is unexpected, unbelievable and excellent. I pray to God for her bright future.

When the time came the labour progressed smoothly and I was on track for a normal delivery but then complications arose when the baby became stuck and the doctor took the decision to deliver through caesarean as the child was in distress. Now barely six weeks later the baby thankfully is healthy and I have fully recovered from the operation and am back to my normal routine - running after a three-year-old and caring for an infant.

The second time you visited me 6 months later for treatment for a new episode of problem , as anybody else would do if only one had a good experience with me and not jut because of mere reviews. Had you not liked my treatment earlier you wouldn’t have visited me again I presume.
A mere consultation fee and 2 culture tests which were necessary for your diagnosis has burnt your pocket and has put a question mark on a doctor’s intentions of curing a patient.

It is your personal judgement and wish not to come back to me!
Being a busy doctor I am unable to thank my countless patients who write good things about me and inspire me to work better. But I regularly reply to my patient's doubts .  
You and your wife visited me for the whole 9 months of your pregnancy (11 times as per PRACTO records) and never found me rude and unjustified in my treatment! 
But in the last moment despite my repeated suggestions, you did not admit your wife to the hospital until she leaked for long 18 hours at home with all liquor drained out. There was no progress of labor and signs of developing infection had set in. Had I not delivered the baby by cesarean section, your wife today would have been in sepsis and your baby would be fighting with infection in the nursery. 
Whatever I have done is according to medical protocol, for the best interest of the patient and the baby and that too with your consent .
You have mistaken my concerns as rude behavior and drama (as per your language).
You should be ashamed of your rough words towards a respectful and reputed doctor!",2016-09-28T20:26:11+0000,Dr. Sutopa Banerjee
