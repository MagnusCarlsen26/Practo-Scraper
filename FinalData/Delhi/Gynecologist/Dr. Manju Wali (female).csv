"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"I had booked an appointment for 7.30 p.m. 
I along with my wife reached there at 7.20 sharp. We found out that our token number is 16 and the token number going on at 7.20 was 7.
Each patient was taking 25 minutes and there was NO COMPUNDER OR ASSISTANT to answer about waiting time. There was no sitting arrangement for pregnant ladies, hardly 2-3 ladies could sit. No AC or water. This was my first and bad experience ever. I strictly do not recommend this doctor.

Hope no one else experiences the same.",2019-05-06 15:19:01,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
