I started  visiting her around late August as i had some complications in my pregnancy, from day one she treated me as her own and put me at ease. She guided me throughout my  pre and post delivery. Dr. Alka is not a stereotype like other doctors who follows same procedure for all  patients. She understands that every pregnant lady is different to others. Dr. alka definitely knows what type of delivery a pregnant lady needs in her situation. In today's hospital industry she is not at all bounded by the pressure. \r\nNow a days we have so many doctors but every would be mother wants to feel secure in every aspect related to her baby and Dr. Alka has the ability to provide that  undoubtedly. She only suggests what is good for you and your baby and not the irrelevant stuff to exceed the bill. If she is asking for a test, it means it is IMPORTANT.\r\nDr. Alka is very empathetic in nature and understands the financial conditions of her patients which I personally feel is a very important aspect.\r\nIn person, she is very nice  and easy going as far as i got to know about her through my appointments.\r\n23rd sept 2016 was my delivery day, she handed me my beautifull dream, my love my baby girl. Before I met her I was scared about so many things. But with her I was not scared at all in the labour room and I was sure my baby would be  safe in her hands. \r\nI think it would be an understatement to say that Dr. Alka transformed  my complicated pregnancy into a beautifull dream. \r\n \r\nVinti Rana \r\n\r\n",

As soon as I conceived again after 7 years ,i searched lots of doctor and that is how i came in contact with my gynaecologist Dr Alka Chaudhary,i started \nmy follow up from week 6 till week 38 , because of my previous history of miscarriages I was always worried she is a  doctor cum friend who always guided me up and encouraged me up not to think about the miscarriages,she always encouraged me up and this is  how now i am a mother of a  beautiful daughter and  the way she handled my delivery and pregnancy,She is  just superb.. she managed my full pregnancy so well and given her outstanding support all the time. I have consulted with few other gyne who are just professional with their patients however Dr Alka Chaudhary is out of the world I would say, she not only listen everyone very patiently and calmly and give personal touch to all,she has never prescribed too much tests or medicines. I would recommend to consult this doctor  for a genuine consultation all the time..love u doctor and thank you for all your support .",

I found she to be very professional and having more focused & personalized approach than others. So, throughout my pregnancy or even post pregnancy, I consulted with her only. Just to mention though I had many serious complications like very high fluctuating sugar readings, high thyroid levels while pregnancy, she took utmost care to handle my case and  helped me to successfully deliver a baby boy. I thank and congratulate for all her endevours. I will strongly recommend her name to others to consult this doctor if you are looking for a specialist gynecologist or have some complications related to pregnancy.",

Then I visited Dr. Alka Chaudhary and my pregnancy time went well with all the complications still I delivered a healthy baby girl and that to a normal delivery which was next to impossible before her. Post delivery I have been seeing her only for all my issues. She is patient, polite and understands the issue well. I would recommend her to all my friends and family members... Thanks and continue doing the good work....",

I started  visiting her around late August as i had some complications in my pregnancy, from day one she treated me as her own and put me at ease. She guided me throughout my  pre and post delivery. Dr. Alka is not a stereotype like other doctors who follows same procedure for all  patients. She understands that every pregnant lady is different to others. Dr. alka definitely knows what type of delivery a pregnant lady needs in her situation. In today's hospital industry she is not at all bounded by the pressure. \r\nNow a days we have so many doctors but every would be mother wants to feel secure in every aspect related to her baby and Dr. Alka has the ability to provide that  undoubtedly. She only suggests what is good for you and your baby and not the irrelevant stuff to exceed the bill. If she is asking for a test, it means it is IMPORTANT.\r\nDr. Alka is very empathetic in nature and understands the financial conditions of her patients which I personally feel is a very important aspect.\r\nIn person, she is very nice  and easy going as far as i got to know about her through my appointments.\r\n23rd sept 2016 was my delivery day, she handed me my beautifull dream, my love my baby girl. Before I met her I was scared about so many things. But with her I was not scared at all in the labour room and I was sure my baby would be  safe in her hands. \r\nI think it would be an understatement to say that Dr. Alka transformed  my complicated pregnancy into a beautifull dream. \r\n \r\nVinti Rana \r\n\r\n",

As soon as I conceived again after 7 years ,i searched lots of doctor and that is how i came in contact with my gynaecologist Dr Alka Chaudhary,i started \nmy follow up from week 6 till week 38 , because of my previous history of miscarriages I was always worried she is a  doctor cum friend who always guided me up and encouraged me up not to think about the miscarriages,she always encouraged me up and this is  how now i am a mother of a  beautiful daughter and  the way she handled my delivery and pregnancy,She is  just superb.. she managed my full pregnancy so well and given her outstanding support all the time. I have consulted with few other gyne who are just professional with their patients however Dr Alka Chaudhary is out of the world I would say, she not only listen everyone very patiently and calmly and give personal touch to all,she has never prescribed too much tests or medicines. I would recommend to consult this doctor  for a genuine consultation all the time..love u doctor and thank you for all your support .",

So, I met the Dr during my 1st month of pregnancy and also consulted other famous doctors around same time. I found she to be very professional and having more focused & personalized approach than others. So, throughout my pregnancy or even post pregnancy, I consulted with her only. Just to mention though I had many serious complications like very high fluctuating sugar readings, high thyroid levels while pregnancy, she took utmost care to handle my case and  helped me to successfully deliver a baby boy. I thank and congratulate for all her endevours. I will strongly recommend her name to others to consult this doctor if you are looking for a specialist gynecologist or have some complications related to pregnancy.",
