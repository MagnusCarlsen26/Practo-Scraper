None,None,0,0,YES,Sir's first interaction with me n my husband was that you will conceive in this cycle only  where i have lost all my hope's and surprisingly i had conceived too  during my 4th IVF i visited Sir after 3 IVF failure and 2 major surgeries .  For Sir i don't have words to say....  But my treatment didn't end even after confirmation of pregnancy too.  i disturbed Sir throughout my pregnancy being my case very critical n Complicated.  Sir's relaxing and calming word's during my pregnancy that too during peak COVID time in March 2020. Today i am there with my kids is all due to Sir n Col Reema Kumar and team. I recommend my known to Sir. If i can conceive anyone can conceive....just have trust on your treating doctor... Sir Big Thank you    üôè,2023-03-22 11:16:09,False,True,Pushpinder Jit kaur ,,,
