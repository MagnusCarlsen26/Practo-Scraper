None,None,0,0,NO,"The doctor has no time for her patients. She doesn't entertain much doubts and concerns whether it is you or your partner asking them.. *** ** **** ******** ***** ***** *Because when we had asked for our first appointment, we were told to come and meet . On visiting we found out that she is not in town and we paid the full consultation fee at her clininc to her junior 
** ** * **** ******* ****** ** **** ***** *** *** * ***** ** *** ** *** ***** ** ** **** ** *** **** * ****** ******** ***** ***** *** ** **** She always directs you to meet her junior doctors *** *** **** *** ******* ****** ** ***** *** **** *** ******* * It was my first pregnancy and they told me nothing about self care or hardly attended to us well. All of us expect that our doctor should gives us time . She hardly gave 2-3 mins  Despite gave soo many medications and injections to take.. I had my miscarriage in third month . That is gods will , we couldn't help. 
I would recommend you go n visit her ..u will get to know that she has no time for you at all.  You will feel this. Rather visit a doctor who has some patience .  After all it is the most important part of our life to bring a life in this world .

None,None,0,0,NO,"I visited clinic to met Dr Seema Sehgal but the behaviour of her staff was very very poor and when my number came Dr Seema simply said go and do first ultrasound. My wife is in first pregnancy and have a lots of doubts in mind but she did not answer as she rush of patients. She simply said goto upltrasound then come again. This is the second ultrasound that Dr Seema Sehgal suggested with in a 2 months of pregnancy. We have a lots of doubts in mind but she did not answer and it is totally misuse of money that I spend with her. 

I do not want to suggest this doctor in future to anyone.",2022-06-29 10:28:51,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
