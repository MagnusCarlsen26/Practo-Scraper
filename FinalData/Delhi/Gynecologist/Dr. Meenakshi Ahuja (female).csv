None,"Fungal Infection,",0,0,YES,"Dr Meenakshi Ahuja was immediately answering to my emergency call on a saturday morning when another doctor (in Greater Kailash) failed to be available on my scheduled appointment. She said she was waiting for me and true: she was there, listened to me and was very caring, very professional. 
I had all necessary tests done and prescription on the same visit and she asked me to whatsapp her on the following Monday before my trip to Nepal to ask for the results of my tests. 

So, yeah,definitely, I will stay with her for my 3 year in India and will recommend her to any person who is asking for a good gynecologist in Delhi.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"This is for all young, hesitant women who identify on the LGBTQA spectrum. Dr. Meenakshi is the doctor for you. She‚Äôs really jovial, candid and handholds you through the entire process. There is no judgement of any kind in the process. 
She‚Äôll talk you through what‚Äôs happening, chart out the way for whatever issue that you‚Äôre facing and ensures that she spends time with you and calms all your worries and doubts. 
I have been looking for a non judgemental and competent Gynecologist for a long time because usually this entire process is marred with negative feedback, judgement and pregnancy centred approach from the doctors. 
A little pricey but it‚Äôs completely worth it and is a definite investment in your health. 

I highly recommend her.
