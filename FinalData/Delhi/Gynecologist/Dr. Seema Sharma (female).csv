"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I was 26 weeks expecting, towards the end of September 2019, when I came to Delhi from Hyderabad. An accident, nearly 1.5 years old, resulted in cartilage rupture in both my knees that had not healed and was posing a challenge during this phase. Thus began my search for a gynaecologist in whom I could trust and find support towards the last phase of pregnancy especially when the injury was adding to the difficulty of the last phase along with other health issues. I came across Dr Sharma's profile and set an appointment during the first week of October. In the first meeting itself her expertise and warmth both became evident and gave me the confidence that I was in good hands. The check-ups accompanied by her guidance made it easier. The big decision regarding a normal or C-sec delivery was the big question that was due to be decided. Dr Sharma at all times gave me practical advice and told me about cases which would give me more clarity while taking my decision. At 36 weeks only (in the morning only when my baby was born), I had dialated 2.5 cm (the usual being 1 cm at that stage) and was told that the delivery could happen any minute. The same evening, I went into labour and now came the hour of decision. Keeping in mind factors like pressure on my knees, duration of my last stage of labour and the injury happening again due to the pressure, a decision for a C-sec was taken. Her smiling face and her motherly touch on the face right before undergoing that operation in the OT among unknown faces and unexpected circumstances, was a big consolation. The result, a healthy baby in my arms.I just want to take this opportunity to extend a big Thank You to Dr Sharma for being there not at as a medical practitioner alone but as a support, a doctor with a human touch that is difficult to find in today's time.",2020-04-01 15:45:14,False,True,Kriti,,,
