None,None,0,0,NO,"I recently visited doctor Anupama for a gynecologic consultation and was extremely disappointed with the experience. The doctor was quite rude and dismissive during our conversation, making me feel uncomfortable and undervalued as a patient. Additionally, she failed to provide clear and thorough information about my condition and treatment plan. She did not explain the medication consumption schedule properly, leaving me confused about when and how to take my prescribed medicine. ** **** ******* ****** her fees were exorbitantly high, especially considering the subpar level of care and service I received. I would not recommend doctor Anupama Gupta to anyone seeking compassionate and professional gynecologic care.
