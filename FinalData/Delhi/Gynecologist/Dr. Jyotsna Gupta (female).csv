None,None,0,0,YES,"She is an Angel I can say, a God Sent Person, A Good Human Being. 

I met her in the Brahmshakti hospital Delhi and I really recommend her to all who need a Best Doctor who listen to them and then provide the best treatment. 
the moment I met her I was at ease that now I am in safe hands. I met a lot of doctors during my Gynec. Problem but none has the time to listen the entire history and they just want to mint Money but after meeting Dr Jyotsna Gupta One meets the Real Doctor who remember the Oath which all doctors take but only few remember that through out their lives. She not only listens patiently but Provides the best Treatment as well. She narrates the entire procedure to the patients (which not many doctors does), She put you at ease Like a Friend and not only during your treatment she remains there but even after the treatment she is available to Help you if needed. 

I met one more gynecologist prior meeting Dr Jyotsna Gupta that Gynec   said first I will do the D&C and take a small tissue  sample and then send it to lab that after getting the report we will see the report than  we will plan the 2nd D&C in which I will clean the entire uterus lining  and both the time she was charging nearly Rs18000/-per D&C, But on Meeting Dr.Jyotsna Gupta she explained that there is no need to do D&C twice, I will clean the entire lining at first which is required why to give you trouble financially and as well physically. she said that in your case the entire lining should be remove. so it was an eye opener for me because as a patient I was not aware of all this, Thank God I met Dr.Jyotsna Gupta and she saved me from 2 procedures, she is the Best Gynec. In Delhi according to my experience. She remained in touch through out till my recovery and after the D&C she assured me that on seeing the content before sending for the biopsy that  it seems everything is normal and no need to worry about any thing (those words provided me the peace of mind because the first gynec was scaring me with the chances of some disease. 

even though I got this procedure done by her in the month of September 2015 I am in  touch with her till date. and She is always there to Guide me whenever I need her help.

Thanks a lot Doctor, Really Appreciate Your Expertise :)

And one important thing about her is that She does a lot for the society and does a lot of social work and Won many awards from many societies (PVT and as well Govt) which we come to know through Newspaper's Articles few months back. one can very well search the net for that to know her achievements.

So Ladies if you really want a Good Experienced  Doctor who listen to your medical problems like a Friend as well I will definitely recommend Dr.Jyotsna Gupta to all.
