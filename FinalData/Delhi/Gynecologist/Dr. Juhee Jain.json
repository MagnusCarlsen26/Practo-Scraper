                "review_text": "I had a history of miscarriages at 6-7 week. Either heartbeat would last for a week only or not be there at all. \n\nAfter two miscarriages, I went to some of the best known doctors who suggested me that IVF was the only way forward due to the presence of an inverted chromosome in me. I was releived to know that IVF would solve all our problems. \n\nI met Dr juhee before proceeding with IVF. She was the only doctor to tell me that IVF was not the solution. She said I had two problems and not one-presence of an inverted chromosome and no growth of the feotus. She clearly told me that IVF would not work because it was not treating both the problems. However, I decided to undergo IVF as no other doctor doubted it. \n\nTo my shock, my pregnancy terminated at 6 week again even after IVF. This was my third miscarriage. It was extremely disheartening for me and my family. I suddenly felt directionless and had lost all hopes to have a successful pregnancy. I even considered surrogacy options to save all the mental trauma. \n\nI then decided to meet Dr juhee again as she had warned me about this outcome. She gave me the confidence that I could carry my baby without an IVF/surrogacy. \n\nI conceived normally and visited her with in the 5th week when I experienced spotting. My endometrium was thin and ultrasound reports were not good. I was extremely scared of ultrasounds due my history of miscarriages. \n\nShe treated me with personal touch. She made sure that I was positive and happy during the treatment. She was the only doctor who worked on physical as well as mental health aspect. \n\nDr juhee gave the best support and medicines that gradually stopped my spotting and improved the endometrium. Every week I saw my ultrasound report getting better which gave me confidence. \n\nToday I'm 24 weeks pregnant. This is nothing less than a miracle for me. \n\nI now follow Dr juhee  blindly and have deep faith in her ability to treat risky pregnancies. My husband and I strongly believe that she is Gods angel who is helping us have the best gift of our lives.\n\nI strongly recommend her for high risk pregnancies.",

I have experienced recurrent abortions in third trimester of pregnancy which is quite rare. These episodes wreaked havoc on my psyche and I had lost almost all hope. \nWe shortlisted Dr Juhee Jain after a lot of thought and research. In the very first visit she has impressed us  with her sense of analysis, understanding of underlying problems, rational diagnosis, prognostic approach and above  all a calm and composed demeanor.She carried on the entire  process of the 9 month care regime in a step by step manner. During the course of 9 months of pregnancy controlling all the body statistics variables was most difficult and she balanced out everything in the best possible way. What I like most about her is   her understanding and rapport she develops with the patient. The personal touch she renders in helping the patient combat her inadequacies is unparalleled. *** *** **** ******* ** ** *** my healthy baby boy is the truly the result of her treatment , diagnosis and blessings. I owe my happiness to Dr. Juhee *** *** ** ***** *** **** ** *** *********** I have met so many expert doctors I mean renowned names of Delhi NCR in Ob-Gyn field ( I do not want to name anyone particularly)all this while, but what I found in her as a health care professional is simply striking  and rare. I have revered sense of respect, a positive bias and unconditional affection to Juhee Madam. *** ** *** **** ** ***** **** ",

Had tried the best doctors from reputed hospitals in Delhi but no one was able to diagnose my problem. I already had a child with cerebral palsy and couldn't afford another one with any issue, was very worried and wanted to have one more baby to be able to support my elder one. Had given up all hopes but God had other plans and sent Dr. Juhee Jain  into  our lives . She went through my entire medical history and asked me to go ahead for a pregnancy. Conception occurred soon and then there was no looking back. She put me on a revolutionary treatment I would say and helped me sail through my entire pregnancy with great confidence and supportives. I finally delivered a healthy baby boy who's almost 8 years now. I don't have enough words to describe  her meticulous approach and commitment towards her profession. She means the world to me since she has given me a new lease of life. God bless her and may she become a ray of hope for countless number of women who are suffering from the same issue. Thank you Doc. ....I love you. ...you're truly unique. ",

I was also very anxious during the delivery, however like a mother she made sure I was at ease during and after the whole emergency C- Section surgery was performed. She is an amazing doctor and a very gentle soul. Also the scar for the C- Section was closed very nearly and any stitches etc are hardly visible even after just 2 weeks of delivery. Also another thing which I liked was that she didn't suggest any extra tests to be done during the pregnancy. I would highly recommend Dr. Juhee to anyone and everyone.thank you so much Doctor for making this journey such a breeze for me.regards",

Her vast experience and judgement in handling the high risk pregnancies always kept us one step ahead of any complexities. She always gave us ample time to answer all our questions which comforted us a lot. We were advised IV drip for essential nutrients and oxygen in the last trimester to which babies responded in a very positive manner and avoided us the risk of pre term delivery.",

Your support in this journey is highly apprecitaed and the way you have guided us throughout our first pregnancy is remarkable. We were very nervous at the start but your expertise gave us lot of courage to go ahead with high risk pregnancy and how we managed to move from 26 weeks when things went unstable to 36 weeks with much improved situation. You have really treated my wife like your daughter which has always given us mental peace in our tough times and always available when we were worried and needed guidance. I highly recommend Dr. Juhee Jain for any sort of pregnancy related queries. She's the best! She has never given us any false promises but believed in her treatments and those benefited us. At her clinic her staff is also very friendly. Big thumbs up from our side and 5 star ratings for her efforts to make our pregnancy successful.",

Either heartbeat would last for a week only or not be there at all. \n\nAfter two miscarriages, I went to some of the best known doctors who suggested me that IVF was the only way forward due to the presence of an inverted chromosome in me. I was releived to know that IVF would solve all our problems. \n\nI met Dr juhee before proceeding with IVF. She was the only doctor to tell me that IVF was not the solution. She said I had two problems and not one-presence of an inverted chromosome and no growth of the feotus. She clearly told me that IVF would not work because it was not treating both the problems. However, I decided to undergo IVF as no other doctor doubted it. \n\nTo my shock, my pregnancy terminated at 6 week again even after IVF. This was my third miscarriage. It was extremely disheartening for me and my family. I suddenly felt directionless and had lost all hopes to have a successful pregnancy. I even considered surrogacy options to save all the mental trauma. \n\nI then decided to meet Dr juhee again as she had warned me about this outcome. She gave me the confidence that I could carry my baby without an IVF/surrogacy. \n\nI conceived normally and visited her with in the 5th week when I experienced spotting. My endometrium was thin and ultrasound reports were not good. I was extremely scared of ultrasounds due my history of miscarriages. \n\nShe treated me with personal touch. She made sure that I was positive and happy during the treatment. She was the only doctor who worked on physical as well as mental health aspect. \n\nDr juhee gave the best support and medicines that gradually stopped my spotting and improved the endometrium. Every week I saw my ultrasound report getting better which gave me confidence. \n\nToday I'm 24 weeks pregnant. This is nothing less than a miracle for me. \n\nI now follow Dr juhee  blindly and have deep faith in her ability to treat risky pregnancies. My husband and I strongly believe that she is Gods angel who is helping us have the best gift of our lives.\n\nI strongly recommend her for high risk pregnancies.",

I have experienced recurrent abortions in third trimester of pregnancy which is quite rare. These episodes wreaked havoc on my psyche and I had lost almost all hope. \nWe shortlisted Dr Juhee Jain after a lot of thought and research. In the very first visit she has impressed us  with her sense of analysis, understanding of underlying problems, rational diagnosis, prognostic approach and above  all a calm and composed demeanor.She carried on the entire  process of the 9 month care regime in a step by step manner. During the course of 9 months of pregnancy controlling all the body statistics variables was most difficult and she balanced out everything in the best possible way. What I like most about her is   her understanding and rapport she develops with the patient. The personal touch she renders in helping the patient combat her inadequacies is unparalleled. *** *** **** ******* ** ** *** my healthy baby boy is the truly the result of her treatment , diagnosis and blessings. I owe my happiness to Dr. Juhee *** *** ** ***** *** **** ** *** *********** I have met so many expert doctors I mean renowned names of Delhi NCR in Ob-Gyn field ( I do not want to name anyone particularly)all this while, but what I found in her as a health care professional is simply striking  and rare. I have revered sense of respect, a positive bias and unconditional affection to Juhee Madam. *** ** *** **** ** ***** **** ",

Had tried the best doctors from reputed hospitals in Delhi but no one was able to diagnose my problem. I already had a child with cerebral palsy and couldn't afford another one with any issue, was very worried and wanted to have one more baby to be able to support my elder one. Had given up all hopes but God had other plans and sent Dr. Juhee Jain  into  our lives . She went through my entire medical history and asked me to go ahead for a pregnancy. Conception occurred soon and then there was no looking back. She put me on a revolutionary treatment I would say and helped me sail through my entire pregnancy with great confidence and supportives. I finally delivered a healthy baby boy who's almost 8 years now. I don't have enough words to describe  her meticulous approach and commitment towards her profession. She means the world to me since she has given me a new lease of life. God bless her and may she become a ray of hope for countless number of women who are suffering from the same issue. Thank you Doc. ....I love you. ...you're truly unique. ",

I was also very anxious during the delivery, however like a mother she made sure I was at ease during and after the whole emergency C- Section surgery was performed. She is an amazing doctor and a very gentle soul. Also the scar for the C- Section was closed very nearly and any stitches etc are hardly visible even after just 2 weeks of delivery. Also another thing which I liked was that she didn't suggest any extra tests to be done during the pregnancy. I would highly recommend Dr. Juhee to anyone and everyone.thank you so much Doctor for making this journey such a breeze for me.regards",

Your support in this journey is highly apprecitaed and the way you have guided us throughout our first pregnancy is remarkable. We were very nervous at the start but your expertise gave us lot of courage to go ahead with high risk pregnancy and how we managed to move from 26 weeks when things went unstable to 36 weeks with much improved situation. You have really treated my wife like your daughter which has always given us mental peace in our tough times and always available when we were worried and needed guidance. I highly recommend Dr. Juhee Jain for any sort of pregnancy related queries. She's the best! She has never given us any false promises but believed in her treatments and those benefited us. At her clinic her staff is also very friendly. Big thumbs up from our side and 5 star ratings for her efforts to make our pregnancy successful.",

She put me on complete bed rest for 4 months, during which, she provided me with constant support, counseling, pep talk, confidence and love. She's like family to us and we seek her advice for all kinds of medical queries. Her experience shows in her confidence with which she gives you the solutions to your medical problems. She's strict with her treatment and you can believe in her with closed eyes. She is a specialist in high risk pregnancies and I'm glad I had her as my doctor, especially during the complications.",

At that time we decided to switch to Dr. Juhee and thank god for that !   Her confidence that came with her experience and her unique treatment instilled faith in me and my entire family.  I was able to stretch my pregnancy till 37 weeks with her help and therapy  and gave birth to a healthy baby last week..Can't thank her enough! ",

Her meticulous approach, well researched methodologies and vast experience has helped us in successfully conceiving and delivering a healthy baby. We approached her through reference after having difficulty in conceiving naturally. She followed a very systematic approach and clearly laid out a plan and different cases for us. I was facing issues with ovulation and as she recommended IUI as a method post inducing ovulation. I successfuly conceived in the first attempt with only one viable egg. Once conceived, she ensured that we take all the right steps to keep a healthy pregnancy and took all the measures to ensure perfect fetal development. My entire pregnancy was smooth sailing because of her proactive approach as most problems were addressed beforehand. Apart from this I also had psoriasis which started flaring up during pregnancy. She helped me manage it well and we were able to control it without any oral medications which is otherwise very difficult. I delivered a healthy baby girl and we owe a lot to her. As a medical professional, she is very approachable and was always a call away. Even when i went into labour, she kept monitoring me from her end through calls and messages. Would recommend her anyday to my family and friends.",

We had already done all kinds of necessary tests but finding no reason for it was making us anxious. Then we happened to meet Dr Juhee Jain through some reference. She understood my critical history of miscarriages and asked to plan again. When we met for current pregnancy after few months we had anxiety and fear. She said \"your existing pregnancy is most precious and i will do everything to save it\".\nShe started my treatment and guided like an expert family member. She was with us throughout the journey of pregnancy and was just a phone call away for any doubt or problems. We were getting more hopeful after completing every single milestones but her confidence and trust on her treatment method gave us more strength.\n\nLike every past pregnancies, I faced spotting and heavy vomiting problem but with the aid of Dr Juhee's medication i could manage all well.Today I am happy to share that i am 35 wk pregnant and it's credit goes to Dr Juhee and her treatment. She came to our life like an angel and helped to make this miracle happen. I think it is never late to start something good and getting a good advice at right time is priceless..\n\nI think she understands women and gynaecological problems more than anyone else.. so i strongly recommend  her for all kind of  gynaecological problems and if its about the high risk pregnancy she is the one stop solution..",

She gave us the best and most modern treatment possible (h/o mcdonald stich in 2 nd preg & now managed with medicines alone), and baby is absolutely healthy (touchwood). \nShe is an extraordinary Doctor and extremely invested one, so much so, that no major complications have surfaced under her care! We are certain that this pregnancy will be successful and safe. \nI will recommend her to everyone, especially if you have been disheartened due to high risk pregnancy complications before. \n",

I got pregnant again at end of last year and consulted her again. She guided me very well throughout the whole period with proper prescriptions, do's/don'ts and the best part which I liked was, not once during the counselling session she said that we might have to go for C-Section and was always positive/motivating for Normal delivery. I had a healthy Baby Girl last month :) . I would recommend her any day to all the would-be mothers or ladies having issues. She is more of a friend to you rather than a doctor.",

One of my family members recommended us her name and work. We have consulted many doctors before but was not satisfied enough as we were after meeting Dr. Juhee in the first time itself. She not only told her efficiency at work but boosted and motivate me to try. In her medication, I\u200b tried and conceived once again. She monitored every bit of my pregnancy\u200b and behold me with all the \u200bnecessary precautions. Being a\u200b working woman\u200bn it was getting tough for me managing my work life and my critical condition\u200b. She consoled very patiently and\u200b time to time advised me and helped me manage both at the same time.\n\nI personally recommend her for those who are actually facing problems like abortion and miscarriage\u200b. She carefully monitors the minute things which others\u200b might forget to consider. I am thankful to her always.",
