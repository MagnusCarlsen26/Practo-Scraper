It was only and only because of her I got the inner strength and finally delivered a baby boy. Every meeting with her was exceptional, not only was she able to diagnose everything perfectly because of her experience, it also boosted my confidence and made me stronger from inside. I could always feel that this time it's going to be all good. On the delivery date as well, I was admant for a Csection but Mam didn't lose hope , she said no matter what I won't do csection as there is no need since both mother and child are perfectly fine. She held my hand, served me juice and gave me motivation regularly. Then after 2-3 hours of pain which is good thing as it helps in pushing baby down , she gave epidural and my labor pain vanished temporarily , which helped a lot as I was able to apply force without feeling pain and got courage and comfort for normal delivery.
