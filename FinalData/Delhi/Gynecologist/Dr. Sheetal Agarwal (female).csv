"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"We got a consultation at the Apollo and we were advised to take an ultrasound and get a follow up with her. But she only remains available for ONE hour at Apollo and then asked us to visit her Hauz Khas private clinic and charged us Rs. 2500/- without any prior intimation. While walking out, she let us know about that we are to deposit 2500 at reception for consultation. I found it unprofessional. Also, though she specifically ensured to be available for communication through phone when I was having pain considering pregnancy, she refused to help when I was in much pain. I would not recommend her for services. ",2019-08-03 14:20:40,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
