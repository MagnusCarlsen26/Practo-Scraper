She is 24*7 available, Whenever u need help, just WhatsApp/call her and there you receive her expert guidance.
.In my case one night ,We were in very big trouble , we WhatsApp to mam for medicines suggestions & beyond my expectations she not only replied but asked to reach clinic and when we reach, there she was along with her staff ready to attend us.

Our case was really complicated as it was Low-Lying Placenta.
But under Dr. Mani ma'am consultation it was very efficiently handed and she gifted us a heathy baby is our Hand.

Dr. Mani Kapoor... We ""Bhawna n Rahul""present our great gratitude towards you n your staff at The Healing Touch.

Dr. Mani was the most helpful doctor in our stay of 3 days. She was very calm and polite about the delivery no matter how scared the family was about it. When she came out of the OT, it was very calming for all of the family members.
 
Overall, it was a very comfortable experience and stay for all our family members, from little kids to oldest members, it was enjoyable too. 

So we thank you for making this delivery memorable and happy one.

In canteen, they were quick in providing orders and were helpful at all times. The canteen staff was polite too. 

Waiting area being the most important part for the family as they require a little comfort if they have to sit for hours, was perfect, absolutely comfortable sofas and enough for all the members of the family. 

Staff members and all nurses were very polite and helpful too in case of anything, and did not hesitate in doing their work.
