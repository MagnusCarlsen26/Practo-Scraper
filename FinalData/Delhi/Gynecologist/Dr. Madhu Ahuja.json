I was in pain and was her first time visitor however she was constant on phone with my mother to settle her down till the time she reached to me at hospital also she Spoke to staff to get the basic needs done to evacuate the time but the staff is not trained. I had started bleeding and was in pain but the staff was busy having party of snacks and tea. After every min I knocked the door as in my pregnancy I was bleeding more n more and their laughing was coming till outside as all the staff were together having the tea time. I blasted and still they took time. All the pregnant women outside were waiting in que ( you may check on sat 5 pm) as OPD had started and they had to get scanning done. On my shouting they said can\u2019t we have tea ? I told them doc timing at 4 and there was no patient till 4:30. I got the reply that 7:30 is our log out time so we have it at this time. I had mouth drop open. Finally after their tea party n laughters I was moved to the room n after pain and all while I got undressed to get my stuff done I was told that it\u2019s a wrong room! Also when I entered the wrong room there were All litters of shakes/ milk / and eatables. No cleaning and pregnant women are scanned there. \nFinally from 4 pm doc time till 5:30 I got to know that I had MISSED my pregnancy. And that pain waiting in the lobby and the rude behaviour of the nurse doing my scan because I disturbed their party and shouting. Must say my first delivery was in cloud 9 Gurgaon n it was so nice hygiene that the reason I was in east Delhi and without any doubt padpadganj side I chose \nNo doubt the doctor was very nice though everyone went and her opd was over still she waited for my husband who was coming from ggn after hearing the news to just explain and settle us because of our loss. I would give alll 5/5 to the doctor but the staff I would say it\u2019s very bad and they should be trained on emergency ",

I had started bleeding and was in pain but the staff was busy having party of snacks and tea. After every min I knocked the door as in my pregnancy I was bleeding more n more and their laughing was coming till outside as all the staff were together having the tea time. I blasted and still they took time. All the pregnant women outside were waiting in que ( you may check on sat 5 pm) as OPD had started and they had to get scanning done. On my shouting they said can\u2019t we have tea ? I told them doc timing at 4 and there was no patient till 4:30. I got the reply that 7:30 is our log out time so we have it at this time. I had mouth drop open. Finally after their tea party n laughters I was moved to the room n after pain and all while I got undressed to get my stuff done I was told that it\u2019s a wrong room! Also when I entered the wrong room there were All litters of shakes/ milk / and eatables. No cleaning and pregnant women are scanned there. \nFinally from 4 pm doc time till 5:30 I got to know that I had MISSED my pregnancy. And that pain waiting in the lobby and the rude behaviour of the nurse doing my scan because I disturbed their party and shouting. Must say my first delivery was in cloud 9 Gurgaon n it was so nice hygiene that the reason I was in east Delhi and without any doubt padpadganj side I chose \nNo doubt the doctor was very nice though everyone went and her opd was over still she waited for my husband who was coming from ggn after hearing the news to just explain and settle us because of our loss. I would give alll 5/5 to the doctor but the staff I would say it\u2019s very bad and they should be trained on emergency ",
