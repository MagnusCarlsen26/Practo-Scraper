"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I had a history of miscarriages at 6-7 week. Either heartbeat would last for a week only or not be there at all. 

After two miscarriages, I went to some of the best known doctors who suggested me that IVF was the only way forward due to the presence of an inverted chromosome in me. I was releived to know that IVF would solve all our problems. 

I met Dr juhee before proceeding with IVF. She was the only doctor to tell me that IVF was not the solution. She said I had two problems and not one-presence of an inverted chromosome and no growth of the feotus. She clearly told me that IVF would not work because it was not treating both the problems. However, I decided to undergo IVF as no other doctor doubted it. 

To my shock, my pregnancy terminated at 6 week again even after IVF. This was my third miscarriage. It was extremely disheartening for me and my family. I suddenly felt directionless and had lost all hopes to have a successful pregnancy. I even considered surrogacy options to save all the mental trauma. 

I then decided to meet Dr juhee again as she had warned me about this outcome. She gave me the confidence that I could carry my baby without an IVF/surrogacy. 

I conceived normally and visited her with in the 5th week when I experienced spotting. My endometrium was thin and ultrasound reports were not good. I was extremely scared of ultrasounds due my history of miscarriages. 

She treated me with personal touch. She made sure that I was positive and happy during the treatment. She was the only doctor who worked on physical as well as mental health aspect. 

Dr juhee gave the best support and medicines that gradually stopped my spotting and improved the endometrium. Every week I saw my ultrasound report getting better which gave me confidence. 

Today I'm 24 weeks pregnant. This is nothing less than a miracle for me. 

I now follow Dr juhee  blindly and have deep faith in her ability to treat risky pregnancies. My husband and I strongly believe that she is Gods angel who is helping us have the best gift of our lives.

Once conceived, she ensured that we take all the right steps to keep a healthy pregnancy and took all the measures to ensure perfect fetal development. My entire pregnancy was smooth sailing because of her proactive approach as most problems were addressed beforehand. Apart from this I also had psoriasis which started flaring up during pregnancy. She helped me manage it well and we were able to control it without any oral medications which is otherwise very difficult. I delivered a healthy baby girl and we owe a lot to her.
