From the initial consultation to the post-surgery follow-ups, Dr. Bafna's positive attitude and expertise were evident every step of the way.\n\nThanks to his skillful surgery and encouraging demeanor, I was able to return to work sooner than expected. Even during my recovery, Dr. Bafna was always available to answer questions and provide support, ensuring I stayed motivated and on track.\n\nNow, I'm delighted to say that I'm back enjoying my summer vacations, fully recovered and feeling better than ever. Dr. Bafna is not just a great surgeon but also a truly helpful and inspiring doctor. I highly recommend him to anyone in need of orthopedic care. Thank you, Dr. Bafna!",

The first time we interacted with Dr. Lalit, I thought to myself, \u201cmy wife\u2019s knee surgery could not be in better hands\ud83d\ude0a\u201d. The best thing about him is he took time to hear us, explained all our options in a very thorough, concise and empathetic manner and once a course of action was decided upon, everything transpired in a quick and efficient manner.  The one thing that differentiates him from other doctors is the level of compassion and sheer dedication towards his patients , never seen a doctor personally reaching out to follow up on the progress during the postoperative period from reviewing daily progress pictures to providing advise and attention to each details even a month after surgery. It has been a month now since my wife underwent surgery and she has completely recovered and able to walk pain free.  Again, extremely thankful and appreciative of Dr. Lalit , ** ** ****** *** *****",

My experience with him was off the charts AMAZING! Dr Bafna patiently listened to all my concerns and took his time to diagnose my condition accurately. I never felt rushed or ignored during my appointments. He made sure I understood every aspect of my condition and explained all the available options to me, leaving no room for confusion. He is not just an expert in his field; he also has a cool and calm personality that is helpful to anxiety-ridden patients like me! On the day of my ligament surgery, I was a bundle of nerves, but his calm and jovial demeanour immediately put me at ease. It made a world of difference to have a surgeon who not only knows what he's doing but also knows how to keep his patients relaxed.\n\nDr. Bafna's commitment to his patients is unparalleled. Throughout my recovery process, he was with me every step of the way. Just five days after my surgery, he got me started with physiotherapy, which played a significant role in my healing journey. His follow-up game is ON POINT! For the first two months after the surgery, he checked in on me CONSTANTLY (I'm not exaggerating), making sure I was committed to my physiotherapy and that my progress was on track. He pushed me when I needed it and praised me when I deserved it. I honestly doubt I would have put in 8-9 hours of physiotherapy every day if I didn't have such an amazing doctor cheering me on.\n\nDr. Bafna's skills, capabilities, and dedication to his patients are beyond impressive. I am eternally grateful to him for helping me regain my mobility and for being a source of unwavering support throughout my recovery. If you're in need of an orthopaedic surgeon, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Bafna. ",

The best thing about him is he took time to hear us, explained all our options in a very thorough, concise and empathetic manner and once a course of action was decided upon, everything transpired in a quick and efficient manner.  The one thing that differentiates him from other doctors is the level of compassion and sheer dedication towards his patients , never seen a doctor personally reaching out to follow up on the progress during the postoperative period from reviewing daily progress pictures to providing advise and attention to each details even a month after surgery. It has been a month now since my wife underwent surgery and she has completely recovered and able to walk pain free.

My experience with him was off the charts AMAZING! Dr Bafna patiently listened to all my concerns and took his time to diagnose my condition accurately. I never felt rushed or ignored during my appointments. He made sure I understood every aspect of my condition and explained all the available options to me, leaving no room for confusion. He is not just an expert in his field; he also has a cool and calm personality that is helpful to anxiety-ridden patients like me! On the day of my ligament surgery, I was a bundle of nerves, but his calm and jovial demeanour immediately put me at ease. It made a world of difference to have a surgeon who not only knows what he's doing but also knows how to keep his patients relaxed.\n\nDr. Bafna's commitment to his patients is unparalleled. Throughout my recovery process, he was with me every step of the way. Just five days after my surgery, he got me started with physiotherapy, which played a significant role in my healing journey. His follow-up game is ON POINT! For the first two months after the surgery, he checked in on me CONSTANTLY (I'm not exaggerating), making sure I was committed to my physiotherapy and that my progress was on track. He pushed me when I needed it and praised me when I deserved it. I honestly doubt I would have put in 8-9 hours of physiotherapy every day if I didn't have such an amazing doctor cheering me on.\n\nDr. Bafna's skills, capabilities, and dedication to his patients are beyond impressive. I am eternally grateful to him for helping me regain my mobility and for being a source of unwavering support throughout my recovery. If you're in need of an orthopaedic surgeon, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Bafna. ",

Dr Lalit Bafna counselled me well and I felt confident after that. I underwent the procedure (Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and Meniscus repair) and after two months now I am all good and perfect with my pain and instability. Very impressed with Dr Lalit Bafna's behaviour and the cost of treatment. He used the International implant's at economic price almost half of what other hospitals quoted me. He is very cooperative and kind. I strongly recommend him for sports injuries . Hospital staff(Nursing Staff, Receptionist etc) is also very good and infrastructure is amazing.",

I was diagnosed with damaged ACL and bucket handle tear in my knee and for almost 5 months i was searching for excellent treatment from a experienced surgeon. During this time period luckily i found out dr. Lalit bafna. He briefed me well about the problem, solution and the outcome. After the successful surgery, he shared his contact number to share every day status and progress of the treatment. I strongly recommend everyone who is looking for a professional surgeon. ",

Yes it was an ACL complete torn, but none but Dr.Lalit had the perservance and skills to match the diagnose, elaborate and treat with utmost experience. Its been 10 days since surgery and I already started feeling like a man with new limb. Dr.Lalit I am thankful to you for your guidance and support all through the rough patches I had gone, especially after experiencing the non ethical practices by others. Sir you're bound to make a mark in the Medical History and I feel proud to be a part of that. Thank you Sir for being such a nice Human Being and thorough professional. I wish India had 100 more Doctors like you, we would have been medical superpower by now. ",

I went through the surgery this October 2021 and I am recovering well by the grace of God and Dr Lalits able hands who helped me overcome this pain.
