Got my mother's bilateral TKR done by him at Indraprastha Apollo, Delhi in 2018 and my mother and my family will always be thankful to him. My mother was in severe pain for last 5 years and she was not able to walk without any support. Her legs were also starting to deform. Dr Kharbanda and his team did such a fine job that my mother feels she got a new life. Surgery was totally painless and so was the recovery. My mother was able to return to normal life after a month and now she goes on 2 mile morning walks. Highly recommend Dr Kharbanda for knee replacement. **** **** *********** ******* ** ***** ****",2020-09-01 17:23:18,False,True,Himanshu Shekhar,,,
