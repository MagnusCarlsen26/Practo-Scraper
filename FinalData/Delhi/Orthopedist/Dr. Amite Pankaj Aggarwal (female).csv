I totally Recommend the Doctor

My Mother was having severe pain in her both knees from last 10 years and now it was very difficult for her to take 2-3 steps. We visited Dr. Amite Pankaj Ji at Fortis on 12th December, 2023 and he explained the problem in detail and suggested for Total Knee Replacement . We were very tensed related to knee replacement but Dr Amite and his team explained in a very good manner that it will be a 2-3 hours process and patient will take start recovering within 2-3 days. She was hospitalized for 5 days and now I can see smile on face of my Mother on day of discharge.
Post Surgery also Dr. Amite meet on daily basis for 4 days to my Mother and assured her that she will get perfect soon.
Ms. Vandana , team member of Dr. Amite also helped us in various ways and she was available on one call.
Mr Akshay Singhal, Physiotherapist helped my mother a lot and also motivated her that she can take steps and walk. Physiotherapist team including all girls member was very cooperative.
Ms. Geetanjali, Night Shift Nurse taken a good care of My mother.
Satisfied with Dr Amite Sir and his team.

It is painless surgery and also there is no pain afterwards if one follows doctor's instructions. Dr Amite has dedicated team of doctors, physiotherapists and coordinators.
