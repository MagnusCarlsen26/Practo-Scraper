"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"from USA  for Spine Surgery 

Hello Dr. Gulati,
          I just want to communicate a word of thanks to you and your team for the excellent work you did. I am back in Houston, Texas, enjoying pain free time with my family. As I continue to heal, I wanted your opinion on the type of sutures and the style used so that I can return to my doctor to have them removed. As mentioned, incision site has  healed and has intermittent itching on both ends due to the sutures. A brief explanation will help with the best approach for the removal. 
My family and I wish you a nice weekend.

Yours faithfully

"Treatment satisfaction,","Hip Replacement,",0,0,YES,"He is quite an experienced Doctor.  I can say he new what exactly my problem was just by looking at the Xray.... I could not explain myself much....he understood my problem much better maybe than i understood it myself....
He told me the operation i was going to undergo was major, not easy, but he reassured me he was going to do his best. 
My leg was short by 13cm. The hip was ankylosed associated with unilateral pelvic tilt and medial rotation of the limb. 
My leg was lengthened  by10cm, the 3cm remaining was due to pelvic tilt. He reassured me that with time the tilted pelvis will come down. As i type now iam 12days post op and the shortening is 2.6cm. Iam greatful for the great care and treatment I received from. Doctor Gulati it is my prayer to the Lord that he may give Him more wisdom to save many lives! 
Thankyou Dr for the great work once againüòç
