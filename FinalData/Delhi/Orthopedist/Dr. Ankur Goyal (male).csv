"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cervical Spondylitis Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Ankur is amazing! I was suffering from cervical spondylosis and had been in pain for weeks, with the pain becoming unbearable. When I visited Dr. Ankur, he attentively listened to my symptoms and the problems I was facing. The medication he prescribed was spot on! I had been taking other painkillers before, but they weren't giving me any relief. However, the ones he prescribed worked perfectly!
He explained everything in detail, which gave me great satisfaction. I would rate the whole treatment 10 out of 10. He is definitely one of the best orthopedic surgeons around.
