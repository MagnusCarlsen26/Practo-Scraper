"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Harmesh Kapoor MS Ortho, Medical superintendant, A one Hospital.
 I suffered a fracture of my Femur. The Doctor after analyzing the x-rays and MRI scans lucidly explained to me that at my age of 70 years, a surgical implantation of Rod & screws would be the best for me to recover on my feet at the soonest time.
 Follow-up surgery and house visits was taken by the doctor. Suggested exercises advised by him  was done religiously. I am happy to say that I am walking and on my own within 4 months and am on the right path to full  recovery in another 2 months.
We never felt rushed through the surgery and I would highly recommend Dr. Kapoor and his team at A one Hospital to others.It has been a pleasure and a relief to know we can count on Dr. Harmesh Kapoor in time of need.
