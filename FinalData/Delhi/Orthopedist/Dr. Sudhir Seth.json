My mother is 86years old and by chance broke her hip bone when she fell down at home on the intervening night of 24th and 25th night i.e Saturday-Sunday night.  My mother was in great pain, we visited Shri Balaji Action hospital in Paschim Vihar who informed us that there was fracture in the right neck of femur.  They did not admitted her for want of Corona Test negative report.  After giving a pain relieving injection they asked us to come on Monday with Corona Test report.  On Sunday on the advice of a relative, I contacted Dr. Sudhir Seth and informed him of my mother's ill health.  He asked me to bring mother to Fortis DOC Hospital, opposite Nehru Place where he arranged operation for Monday.  Immediately on our arrival, hospital carried out all the necessary tests as per the direction of the doctor.  Since my mother has heart problem since 2015, Dr. Seth consulted a heart specialist who after Eco Test asked the Doctor to take the patient to a hospital which is better facilitated with heart equipment and aids.  Dr. Seth without wasting time managed booking with National Heart Institute, East of Kailash and made his best efforts by using his contacts take morning slot to operate my mother on 27th October (Tuesday).  It was about 4 hours successful operation conducted by Dr. Sudhir Seth in the presence of cardiologist.  Very next day on Wednesday, Doctor helped my mother to see that she walks with the support of a walker.  My mother has been discharged on 30th October with stable condition.  With the blessings of Almighty and sincere efforts made by Dr. Seth, my mother has got extended lease of her life.  Our entire family is very happy and thank Dr. Seth for his experienced hands in saving many such people who are not sure which Doctor to be consulted for Orthopedic problems.  With my this message, I would suggest Dr. Sudhir Seth  is one of the best Orthopedic consultant and surgeon in NCR who is very cooperative and accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I did not get proper reports of the XRays despite asking (which for same price you will get in any other center) so I could not use it for a 2nd consultation. After a lot of insisting they had just allowed me to click some pictures of the XRays but even that did not have any diagnostics. He suggested some 7-8 medicines but all of them were only available in his clinic and nowhere in the market. \nSo I was not satisfied with treatment. Later I had to show to another doctor and seek consultation",

My mother is 86years old and by chance broke her hip bone when she fell down at home on the intervening night of 24th and 25th night i.e Saturday-Sunday night.  My mother was in great pain, we visited Shri Balaji Action hospital in Paschim Vihar who informed us that there was fracture in the right neck of femur.  They did not admitted her for want of Corona Test negative report.  After giving a pain relieving injection they asked us to come on Monday with Corona Test report.  On Sunday on the advice of a relative, I contacted Dr. Sudhir Seth and informed him of my mother's ill health.  He asked me to bring mother to Fortis DOC Hospital, opposite Nehru Place where he arranged operation for Monday.  Immediately on our arrival, hospital carried out all the necessary tests as per the direction of the doctor.  Since my mother has heart problem since 2015, Dr. Seth consulted a heart specialist who after Eco Test asked the Doctor to take the patient to a hospital which is better facilitated with heart equipment and aids.  Dr. Seth without wasting time managed booking with National Heart Institute, East of Kailash and made his best efforts by using his contacts take morning slot to operate my mother on 27th October (Tuesday).  It was about 4 hours successful operation conducted by Dr. Sudhir Seth in the presence of cardiologist.  Very next day on Wednesday, Doctor helped my mother to see that she walks with the support of a walker.  My mother has been discharged on 30th October with stable condition.  With the blessings of Almighty and sincere efforts made by Dr. Seth, my mother has got extended lease of her life.  Our entire family is very happy and thank Dr. Seth for his experienced hands in saving many such people who are not sure which Doctor to be consulted for Orthopedic problems.  With my this message, I would suggest Dr. Sudhir Seth  is one of the best Orthopedic consultant and surgeon in NCR who is very cooperative and accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Also we had taken a time but we were asked to wait as there were patients before us as well. So what was the point of taking appointment through Practo. \r\n\r\nDoctor is certainly good as the pain has reduced significantly . But make sure to shell out more money.

Only because of the fact that i\u2019d heard so much about how good a Doctor he is, i decided to show blind trust and kept coming back every month only to burn a hole in my pocket. ** **** **** ***** *** **** ** ****** *** each time he said it\u2019ll be fine till next month, keep continuing the medicines. ***** *** **** *** ** ******* ************** *** ******** *** ********* ** ** ******* ******** I had a very disappointing experience and would never prefer to seek treatment from him moving forward.
