I was in the emergency seeing my post- operative patients and consulted your mother at 12:15pm. I advised x rays for her which were done around 1pm. You came back and was informed by the room coordinator that there is another doctor seeing a patient in the same room (room no 8) and once that patient is done, you will be called. Once that patient was over, I was called by my coordinator at 1:36pm and I was in room at 1:38pm. \nThe moment you entered the room, you rudely mentioned that this hospital is the most inefficient hospital and you had to wait for 2 hours for a simple consultation with x ray. I patiently explained the x ray findings to your mother reassuring her that it\u2019s not a major injury and she will be fine. \nYou then said \u201cwhy should I come to consult you in this hospital if you also take the same time as the other bigger hospital\u201d. \nThen I mentioned that if you come to a hospital, you should keep time handy (considering wait time at various places including radiology room and consultation room) as both rooms were continuously attending to patients in the meanwhile. And if you want a quick treatment then you should go to a clinic. It was you who mentioned that yes I realised later that you have a clinic close to my residence. \n\nWhen a doctor is working in a hospital, he is attending to patients in opd, emergency and those coming for smaller procedures and dressings all at the same time and even the ward patients. \n\nI showed empathy to your mother despite your choice of words for me and my hospital which was totally uncalled for. I hope that you also develop some empathy for the clinicians. \nWish your mother a speedy recovery!",

But the doctor arrived 30 minutes after the appointment time (there was nobody before us)We then had to wait again for more than 30 minutes for the doctor to come back from his rounds to show him the X-Ray.We tried to complain that overall it too us 2.5 hours for a simple case of hairline fracture (with overall consultation time of 20 minutes) even when there were no other waiting patients and even for such an old patient.The doctor told us we should keep 2-3 hours free for an OPD appointment in CK Birla hospital. He also said if he wants to get it done faster we should visit his private clinic. I am not aware why the doctor was repeatedly late and he didn't try to explain.

None of them were able to help me much. They wouldn't listen to me properly and neither would they properly examine my injury.I finally consulted Dr Chawla in March 2020. He was extremely friendly, made me feel comfortable and conducted my examination thoroughly. He was extremely patient, answered all my questions. Finally he performed surgery on my ankle. It's been 2 moths, and I feel much better. The doctor is always available to answer my questions and regularly keeps taking updates on my recovery",

Dr. Anuj was really kind to rent a wheel chair for travel from home, minimising our stress to reach the clinic. He patiently explained the problem to my husband, as well as to us. He explained the treatment options available and answered all our queries. The clinic was well equipped and we did not have to step out for x-ray. We are satisfied with the consultation and the treatment provided. Would highly recommend.",

His guidance to split the plaster for air travel came in very handy. \n\nHe also gave us multiple options in order to suit our requirements along with suggesting the best one.\n\nPatient was in double mind at last minute on late evening around 8pm and he was patient enough to wait for us for our final decision and complete the plaster.\n\nHe is very friendly *** ************* *** I would highly recommend him.\n\nI myself have visited him for my treatment as well.",

I did 4 well performed x-rays (including one of uninjured foot) for better comparison in view of previous foot treatment that your child sought after his birth (but charged for 2). I did compare the opposite sides x ray to show you that the fracture line collaborated with site of tenderness(pain on pressing). I informed you that it\u2019s a stable fracture as he has been walking on it and it is hairline. The reason for advising the cast was to give better rest to child and for better compliance. I hope that he recovers well and I wish you and your child best of health.",
