Tomar said there is no use of X Ray and to get MRI!\n\nSaid the reason for pain could be anything (bursa, meniscus or ligament), and possibly to try physiotherapy and come back after 10 days. Finally, when asked what to tell the physiotherapist, he said they know their job ******\n\nNot friendly and not willing to explain enough and have a conversation. On being told that I have a related medical issue, he just said I should not be doing anything for fitness *****. \n\nAll in all, very bad experience, not at all recommended.",
