I just felt the whole thing was rushed and I was merely treated as a transaction that needed to happen so the consultation could move on to the next patient. There were no after care instructions - dos/dont’s provided.  He might be a good doctor but I expected more from him.

All the charges  are displayed in reception and these are the routine charges all across dwarka.

Normally all those patients who ask about charges are told the charges. 

Still after this experience I would ensure that the patient should pay the the charges before hand so that there is no comfusion.

You already mentioned that u were given a discount- u paid total of 3000- (700 consultation plus 600 xray and 1700 for plaster- so in plaster charges u were given a discount of  approx 60 percent) as I told u to give watever you want.

I beg to differ regarding the rushing of things.  

I clearly remember that we had a discussion about treatment. Even surgery was an option if u want to avoid any deformity in hand but as we discussed functionally plaster would suffice. And as plaster is sufficient we planned for plaster management.

All your questions were answered.

Dos and donts are mentioned in your prescription if you see.

Also I try to answer all questions of the patients.

In my prescription I have given my watsapp number which i reply usually the same day.

Regarding pain , its just 10 days , fracture healing takes time and you were asked to do follow up after 5 days  which you did not.

I am still open for any discussion regarding management.

WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFEY ON YOUR ISSUES.

HOPE YOU TAKE SOME TIME TO READ IT OUT.

ANY FOOT ISSUE REQUIRES TWO X RAYS SO BOTH AP AND OBLIQUE VIEWS WERE DONE. THATS THE STANDARD PROTOCOL ALL OVER THE WORLD, SO TWO X RAYS WERE DONE.

ROOT CAUSE AT TIMES CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED BY CLINICAL EXAMINATION AND X RAYS.

FINDING ROOT CAUSE MAY INVOLVE COSTLY AND INCONVENIENT TESTS LIKE MRI ,SO WE TRY TO FIND ROOT CAUSE  IN PATIENTS WITH PROBLEM LIKE YOURS  ONLY  IF WE ARE SUSPECTING ANYTHING SERIOUS /IF THE TREATMENT CHANGES BY FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE .


AS WE WERE NOT SUSPECTING ANYTHING SERIOUS IN YOUR  CASE ,ONLY X RAY WAS DONE TO RULE OUT COMMON ISSUES.

WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSIONS TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE ARE SUSPECTING AND ALSO TO EXPLAIN THE COURSE OF YOUR DISEASE.

MOST PATIENTS RECOVER WITH THE TREATMENT GIVEN TO YOU IN YOUR PROBLEM.


GET WELL SOON.
