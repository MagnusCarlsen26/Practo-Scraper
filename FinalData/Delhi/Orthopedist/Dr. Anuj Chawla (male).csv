He also said if he wants to get it done faster we should visit his private clinic. I am not aware why the doctor was repeatedly late and he didn't try to explain. However he was clearly unempathetic *** ********* ** ********* *******,2023-05-01 08:52:02,False,False,Abhishek Chauhan,"Dear Abhishek,

Thank you for your feedback as it’s gives a chance for us to share a clinicians side of the story as well.
You came with your mother for a week plus old injury with an appointment time of 11:45pm. I was in the emergency seeing my post- operative patients and consulted your mother at 12:15pm. I advised x rays for her which were done around 1pm. You came back and was informed by the room coordinator that there is another doctor seeing a patient in the same room (room no 8) and once that patient is done, you will be called. Once that patient was over, I was called by my coordinator at 1:36pm and I was in room at 1:38pm. 
The moment you entered the room, you rudely mentioned that this hospital is the most inefficient hospital and you had to wait for 2 hours for a simple consultation with x ray. I patiently explained the x ray findings to your mother reassuring her that it’s not a major injury and she will be fine. 
You then said “why should I come to consult you in this hospital if you also take the same time as the other bigger hospital”. 
Then I mentioned that if you come to a hospital, you should keep time handy (considering wait time at various places including radiology room and consultation room) as both rooms were continuously attending to patients in the meanwhile. And if you want a quick treatment then you should go to a clinic. It was you who mentioned that yes I realised later that you have a clinic close to my residence. 

When a doctor is working in a hospital, he is attending to patients in opd, emergency and those coming for smaller procedures and dressings all at the same time and even the ward patients. 

I showed empathy to your mother despite your choice of words for me and my hospital which was totally uncalled for. I hope that you also develop some empathy for the clinicians. 
Wish your mother a speedy recovery!",2023-05-01T17:20:56+0000,Dr. Anuj Chawla

Thank you for your feedback. I remember you coming with your son 2 weeks back after he injured due to fall from cycle. I did 4 well performed x-rays (including one of uninjured foot) for better comparison in view of previous foot treatment that your child sought after his birth (but charged for 2). I did compare the opposite sides x ray to show you that the fracture line collaborated with site of tenderness(pain on pressing). I informed you that it’s a stable fracture as he has been walking on it and it is hairline. The reason for advising the cast was to give better rest to child and for better compliance. I hope that he recovers well and I wish you and your child best of health.",2020-04-05T06:20:12+0000,Dr. Anuj Chawla
