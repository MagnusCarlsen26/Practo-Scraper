"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"I am forever grateful to Dr. Ankit sir for giving me a new lease on life. When I first consulted Dr. Ankit, I had lost all hope. Every doctor I had seen had told me that my condition, Avascular Necrosis of the Foot, was incurable and that I would have to learn to live with the pain for the rest of my life.

But he refused to give up on me. He took on my case with unwavering dedication and expertise, and performed a rare and complex foot surgery that no other doctor was willing to attempt. I think this is the one of the first surgery in the country.

What struck me most was his exceptional communication skills - he explained every detail in a simple, easy-to-understand way, making sure I was comfortable and informed throughout the process. He even called me personally to check on my condition, over the phone. His smile is so amazing and you will forget all your pain just by seeing his smile and kind nature.

Thanks to his tireless efforts and innovative approach, I am now pain-free after suffering for over two years. His compassion, kindness, and commitment to his patients are unparalleled. The entire staff at Sparsh Orthopedic, from the nurses to the other doctors, were supportive and kind, making my journey so much easier.

Dr. Ankit is more than just a doctor - he is a true healer. He saw beyond my diagnosis and saw me, a person in need of hope and healing. He took responsibility for my care when others wouldn't, and his expertise and skill have given me a second chance at life.

If you're struggling with a condition that seems impossible to treat, don't give up. Dr. Ankit and the team at Sparsh Orthopedic are a shining example of the power of medical excellence and compassion. I will be forever grateful for their care and recommend them to anyone seeking a doctor who truly cares.

What were you expecting, a magic.
We talked on phone on 28th regarding the reports. Have you ever seen a doctor calling up and telling you the report. Yes we do this. Did you appreciate this. No. 
Then I enquired how is your pain and you said it‚Äôs perfectly fine now. This means the diagnosis and treatment was spot on. 
Did you thank me for this. No. 
Did you even read the msg of appointment. It states that appointment comes with a wait time of 30 minutes. Your appointment was scheduled for 12:20, consultation started on 12:40 and you were out of my cabin exactly at 12:53. 
This time keeping also requires intelligence, we do not expect this precise time keeping from you, still this was just for your knowledge that we were on time. 
We serve with a smile but with smile we do not loose seriousness and professionalism. 
We take each and every ones problem seriously, how so ever small it may seem, we never take it lightly. And on top of it we do not leave your hand till your recovery is complete. We call up operated patients to enquire about their well being. Ever seen any one do this. Despite being very busy we do it everyday. 
There are 2 kind of person we never want to treat
1. Thankless people.
2. People without sympathy and empathy. (Your tone for the reception staff- hum jaise professional log ko wo samjha rahe hai)
We regret having treated you. 
All the best with Thanks and Empathy

Thanks for your valuable feedback. Well we really insist on taking medicines from in-house pharmacy and the whole purpose of this is to decrease your hassle of roaming from pharmacy to pharmacy and getting irritated. Then calling us and asking to make the pharmacist understand the medicines. Pharmacist will not have the same medicine then asking to give a supplement. Just imagine how much time and energy is wasted in all this. Just imagine the chaos for us after seeing more than 50 patients daily and 50% patients calling up for medicines alone. All wants branded medicines we give branded only. All wants discount on medicine we give that also. After all this I could never understand why one wants to roam around with the prescription which has the tried and tested medicines to suit you best with least side effects and ending up with over the counter medicines.  

Thanks

Again We would enlighten the fact that it is not a corporate office meeting appointment. It‚Äôs a doctors appointment and waiting time can increase significantly on occasional days. Any walk in patient coming to hospital doesn‚Äôt come to enjoy a pizza. They are also in pain and they need to be  respected too. 
5:30 to 6:15 all appointments came in late and all arrived around 6:15. Just imagine the amount of time wasted and chaos created. And also think about who created it. Also if you can think about the solution to this I would love to have it. Should we send them back, or give a negative recommendation to patients coming late. 
We did not make you wait doing something not meant to be done during OPD hours. We did not make you wait sipping a coffee and chatting with friends. We were working at highest level of professionalism taking care of every one the perfect timers, the walkins and the late comers and yes without compromising on the time and quality of consultation. 
I guess you forgot to mention about your experience with the doctor, the quality of consultation, advice and medication given? 
Or maybe the stresses of delay was so much that all the positives were forgotten.
Where-in every one waited with patience. 
All that was needed was a little patience.
After getting your tennis elbow fixed will surely have a game of tennis someday.
