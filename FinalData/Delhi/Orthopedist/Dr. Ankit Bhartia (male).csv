"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I am forever grateful to Dr. Ankit sir for giving me a new lease on life. When I first consulted Dr. Ankit, I had lost all hope. Every doctor I had seen had told me that my condition, Avascular Necrosis of the Foot, was incurable and that I would have to learn to live with the pain for the rest of my life.

But he refused to give up on me. He took on my case with unwavering dedication and expertise, and performed a rare and complex foot surgery that no other doctor was willing to attempt. I think this is the one of the first surgery in the country.

What struck me most was his exceptional communication skills - he explained every detail in a simple, easy-to-understand way, making sure I was comfortable and informed throughout the process. He even called me personally to check on my condition, over the phone. His smile is so amazing and you will forget all your pain just by seeing his smile and kind nature.

Thanks to his tireless efforts and innovative approach, I am now pain-free after suffering for over two years. His compassion, kindness, and commitment to his patients are unparalleled. The entire staff at Sparsh Orthopedic, from the nurses to the other doctors, were supportive and kind, making my journey so much easier.

Dr. Ankit is more than just a doctor - he is a true healer. He saw beyond my diagnosis and saw me, a person in need of hope and healing. He took responsibility for my care when others wouldn't, and his expertise and skill have given me a second chance at life.

If you're struggling with a condition that seems impossible to treat, don't give up. Dr. Ankit and the team at Sparsh Orthopedic are a shining example of the power of medical excellence and compassion. I will be forever grateful for their care and recommend them to anyone seeking a doctor who truly cares.

My Dad Sustained Hip fracture 4 yrs back and hip replacement was done in a corporate hospital in Gurgaon. Following which He was never able to put weight on his operated leg and was bed ridden since 4 yrs. Doctor who operated were never ready to accept that something is wrong with operated Hip. Time passed and gradually pain increased to such an extent that even minor movement in bed was extremely painful. We consulted numerous Doctors but without any satisfactory solution.
Then my relative who got knee replacement done by Dr. Ankit  informed us about him. We met Dr. Ankit and asked him to just relieve the pain of my father so that whole family can atleast sleep peacefully. He explained to us meticulously about the problem and the treatment. We were immediately convinced to get the procedure done as advised by Dr. Ankit. We never thought if dad would be able to walk again, and at 2 weeks time my Dad was on his feet walking with the help of walker. It was like a miracle for us. Dr. Ankit not just relieved pain of my father but also made him capable of doing his daily personal task.
Very rarely do we meet such Genuine Doctors with such command and in-depth knowledge in the Subject. I wont forget to mention his time management skills, he is always busy still always on time. 
I will be highly indebted to him for ending my fathers pain and agony.
May God Bless Dr. Ankit.

For blood tests just thank God that I got only minimal test done worth Rs. 600/-.
I could have easily called u in 5 days time n med cost would have been 400/- but it would have led to wastage to your energy, time and money and u would go out with same med. So to save your time n money I called u in 2 weeks time as I know wrist pains are troublesome sometimes and can take time to heal.
It requires intelligence to think this way. And we seriously think before u start treatment just trust your Doctor and do not ruin things from your end itself.

You were diagnosed and treated perfectly well for ankle sprain by Dr. Ankit Bhartia as you said. 
The problem was you were given a mis-Diagnosis by junior doctors to which you did not want to listen. Dr. Ankit after examining your ankle and seeing the X-Ray validated that there is no fracture and there is only ligament injury and treated you for same. You came to Sparsh to consult the super-specialist  in the field who is Dr. Ankit so it makes no sense pondering over the diagnosis given by juniors. 
We strongly advise patient to take home only Wat is relevant and not ponder over irrelevants. You were called in a weeks time for re-assessment n start rehab, re-assessment does not mean re X-Ray. One also needs to understand correctly Wat is being conveyed.
This also would justify that everyone injured should get treated at Sparsh as patients will never be misguided what ever be the diagnosis given by other doctors or even our junior Doctors. 
The diagnosis and treatment will be unbiased, spot on and leading to quick recovery.

I guess u r talking abt the overall amount u had to pay. So it includes consultation fee 300, 2 digital Xray of wrist and ankle  400x2=800, blue synthetic Plaster material itself cost 2300, medicine for 1 month and finally Plaster application. If so much is done in just 5k, I think it's the best and most affordable place in Gurgaon for multiple injuries and Synthetic Plaster application.

Then I enquired how is your pain and you said it‚Äôs perfectly fine now. This means the diagnosis and treatment was spot on. 
Did you thank me for this. No.

This time keeping also requires intelligence, we do not expect this precise time keeping from you, still this was just for your knowledge that we were on time. 
We serve with a smile but with smile we do not loose seriousness and professionalism. 
We take each and every ones problem seriously, how so ever small it may seem, we never take it lightly. And on top of it we do not leave your hand till your recovery is complete. We call up operated patients to enquire about their well being. Ever seen any one do this. Despite being very busy we do it everyday.

1. Thankless people.
2. People without sympathy and empathy. (Your tone for the reception staff- hum jaise professional log ko wo samjha rahe hai)

"Wait time,","Joint Pain,",0,0,NO,waiting time is mite than 45 mins and there isno value of time for pre booking.  bad experience. practo claims smooth booking and appointment but the practical eos something different.,2021-02-24 13:55:57,False,False,Verified Patient,"Thoda patience rakho bhai. 
Again We would enlighten the fact that it is not a corporate office meeting appointment. It‚Äôs a doctors appointment and waiting time can increase significantly on occasional days. Any walk in patient coming to hospital doesn‚Äôt come to enjoy a pizza. They are also in pain and they need to be  respected too. 
5:30 to 6:15 all appointments came in late and all arrived around 6:15. Just imagine the amount of time wasted and chaos created. And also think about who created it. Also if you can think about the solution to this I would love to have it. Should we send them back, or give a negative recommendation to patients coming late. 
We did not make you wait doing something not meant to be done during OPD hours. We did not make you wait sipping a coffee and chatting with friends. We were working at highest level of professionalism taking care of every one the perfect timers, the walkins and the late comers and yes without compromising on the time and quality of consultation. 
I guess you forgot to mention about your experience with the doctor, the quality of consultation, advice and medication given? 
Or maybe the stresses of delay was so much that all the positives were forgotten.
Where-in every one waited with patience. 
All that was needed was a little patience.
After getting your tennis elbow fixed will surely have a game of tennis someday.
