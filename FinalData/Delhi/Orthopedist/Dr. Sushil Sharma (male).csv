None,"Joint Replacement Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I highly recommend Dr. Sushil Sharma to anyone who is considering joint replacement surgery. My aunt visited him for a knee replacement surgery one year ago, and she has been doing great ever since. The surgery was a success, and she has been able to return to her normal activities without any pain. My uncle also recently visited Dr. Sharma for a rotator cuff repair. The surgery was also a success, and he is already feeling much better. He was able to return to work after just a few weeks.
I was very impressed with Dr. Sharma's knowledge, skill, and bedside manner. He took the time to explain my aunt and uncle's conditions in detail and answer all of our questions. He also made sure that they were comfortable and informed throughout the entire process.
The facilities at the clinic were clean and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Dr. Sharma to anyone who is considering joint replacement surgery.",2023-07-20 10:36:41,False,True,Rahul Sharma,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Orthopedic Consultation,Knee replacement,",0,0,YES,"1. I did not see any doctor better than Dr. Sushil Sharma in my life. My brother had a very dangerous accident 10 years ago, in which his elbow bone of his right arm was badly broken and came out of the meat. We thought that in his right hand it is now no longer the same as before. But Dr. Sushil Sharma has some magic wand, he has done his operation by doing my brother's hand properly. Today he runs a bike with the same hand, he also typing, and even more weight is also very comfortable. Defense takes.
2.  Five years ago, my father-in-law was very troubled by the pain of the knee. Sushil Sharma advised us to knee Replacement, Dad was very scared but he explained it with so much love and trust that he recognized, and not only did he assist us in the operating expenses. Today, my father is free from the pain of his feet due to Dr. Sushil and the ladder also climbs and runs.
