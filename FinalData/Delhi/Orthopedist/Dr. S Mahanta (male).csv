The best treatment for a toe fracture is a plaster for 3 to 4 weeks. Otherwise there tend to be some persistent pain and some displacement of the fracture. Even for soft tissue injury when there is no fracture we put plaster for 10 to 14 days. Regarding the length lower limb plasters are either below knee or above knee. Regarding the removal treatment protocols differ from doctor to doctor and putting a plaster always does good rather than harm to a patient.,2022-04-28T14:13:49+0000,Dr. S Mahanta
