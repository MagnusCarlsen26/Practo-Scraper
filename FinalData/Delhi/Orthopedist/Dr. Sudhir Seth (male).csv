My mother is 86years old and by chance broke her hip bone when she fell down at home on the intervening night of 24th and 25th night i.e Saturday-Sunday night.  My mother was in great pain, we visited Shri Balaji Action hospital in Paschim Vihar who informed us that there was fracture in the right neck of femur.  They did not admitted her for want of Corona Test negative report.  After giving a pain relieving injection they asked us to come on Monday with Corona Test report.  On Sunday on the advice of a relative, I contacted Dr. Sudhir Seth and informed him of my mother's ill health.  He asked me to bring mother to Fortis DOC Hospital, opposite Nehru Place where he arranged operation for Monday.  Immediately on our arrival, hospital carried out all the necessary tests as per the direction of the doctor.  Since my mother has heart problem since 2015, Dr. Seth consulted a heart specialist who after Eco Test asked the Doctor to take the patient to a hospital which is better facilitated with heart equipment and aids.  Dr. Seth without wasting time managed booking with National Heart Institute, East of Kailash and made his best efforts by using his contacts take morning slot to operate my mother on 27th October (Tuesday).  It was about 4 hours successful operation conducted by Dr. Sudhir Seth in the presence of cardiologist.  Very next day on Wednesday, Doctor helped my mother to see that she walks with the support of a walker.  My mother has been discharged on 30th October with stable condition.  With the blessings of Almighty and sincere efforts made by Dr. Seth, my mother has got extended lease of her life.  Our entire family is very happy and thank Dr. Seth for his experienced hands in saving many such people who are not sure which Doctor to be consulted for Orthopedic problems.  With my this message, I would suggest Dr. Sudhir Seth  is one of the best Orthopedic consultant and surgeon in NCR who is very cooperative and accessible.
