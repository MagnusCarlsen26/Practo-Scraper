"Wait time,","Heel Pain,Knee Pain,",0,0,YES,"Visited the Doctor for Knee pain and Heal pain. Doctor was friendly but not professional. He advised us the physiotherapy and some tests and send us to the physiotherapist without our consent. We were also told to give the blood sample for some tests for which when we asked the price from the reception, they were not aware of the price.

At the physiotherapist the ointments and oils used for physiotherapy were charged extra to us and that too without our consent. 

Medicines mentioned on the diagnosis sheet were for 1 week but the medicos guy was reluctant for complete sets which were for almost 4 weeks.

And finally, the consultation fees mentioned is Rs.500, but we were charged Rs.800.

Good Thing: Doctor is a gold medalist and pinpointed the problem in our case.

Word of Advise: Kindly ask for prices in detail in advance.
