None,None,0,0,YES,"Last Month My Mother had a Total Knee Replacement Surgery of both of her Legs from Dr. PUNIT JAIN at the FORTIS Hospital Shalimar Bagh...We had an extremely comfortable experience pre and post the surgery while during my Mother's stay at the Hospital.
Dr. Jain regularly came to review her condition twice a day while She was in the Hospital post the Surgery.

It has been almost 1 month post my Mother's surgery and She is recovering fast...We have been regularly going to Dr. Jain every 10 days post the surgery to get advice on the recovery, medicines, etc.. 

Dr Jain has been extremely Polite, helpful and above all have been encouraging my Mother to calm her anxieties..

We are very satisfied with the good Care, attention that We have received from Dr. Jain and his Staff especially Mr. GAURAV…

We wish Dr JAIN all the very best…

And sincerely thank him…
