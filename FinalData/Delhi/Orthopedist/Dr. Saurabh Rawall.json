You are the latter.\nHe is like a Brother to God for us.\nThen also gonna express my feeling and experience with Dr. Saurabh Rawall.\nMy Brother underwent Scoliosis Surgery(having a severe curve). Our first conversation with Dr. Saurabh Rawall made us so comfortable that we decided at that point to go for it. He explained each and everything so clearly we were satisfied with of all of those. Then also we were having fear in us but by the Grace of God, Surgery was successful. The moment Sir told me surgery is Successful, I thank God and Dr Saurabh Rawall who dedicately gave so much of his time with Dr Alok Gupta. Thank you for everything that you have done for us; the hospital environment has always made me nervous, but you made it bearable. Thank you for all of your services.\nDr Saurabh Rawall is not the best doctor everyone expects but hardly finds.\n\nHis Assistant Dinesh is also a nice person.\nI pray to God that no one should have such disease but in any case if he or she have would really recommend Dr Saurabh Rawall undoubtedly.\nSuperheroes don\u2019t wear capes, they wear aprons and save us in our hard times. So grateful for your service!\nMay God bless Dr Saurabh Rawall, Dr Alok Gupta and their families and have bright future.\n",

Problem was started in Oct 23 from pain in arms and shoulders, after a week it slipped into paralysis of lower body with numbness/ stiffness. It was very dangerous for me as I was not able to walk, gut was involved so no motion for 2-3 days and due to this my office job and daily routine was disrupted. I searched for the best surgeons in Delhi NCR for approx. 3 months and consulted 14 -15 top spinal surgeons in Delhi NCR, underwent physiotherapy and sought homeopathic treatment, nothing worked, eventually, I met with Dr. Saurabh Rawall. He was convincing to my satisfaction; Dr. Saurabh, who made this surgery very simple and clear to me. ** ** *** **** ****** ******* * **** **** ** **** Very humble, soft spoken and highly intelligent surgeon. I was operated on 8 mar 24, now its almost 6 weeks post-surgery, the outcome of surgery is very good. All body tightness/ numbness has gone. Alhamdolillah recovering very well, walking to office, living normal daily routine. Many thanks to Dr. Saurabh for making this surgery highly successful. We have been listening from childhood about doctor\u2019s idealism and I must say Dr. Saurabh is a complete package with all good qualities of human doctor. I wish him a great success ahead.",

He has always advised me to exercise and keep the posture right. I did not pay attention to my health and finally had to opt for surgery after a couple of slip-disk episodes. Again, this was not the first or only option that Dr. Saurabh advised. However, when my MRIs showed that exercising will not help, he asked me to consider surgery. I visited doctors in AIIMS and Medanta for a second opinion. Shockingly I got terrible advice from AIIMS and Medanta doctor also gave me bleak scenarios. Dr. Saurabh\u2019s advice on what to expect during surgery and post-surgery recovery was spot-on. I was put at ease by his crew as well. My recovery has been easy. Dr. Saurabh has responded to my texts at odd hours when I needed his opinion. I would recommend Dr. Saurabh to anyone suffering from back-pain or needing spine surgery. He is an experienced and very well-qualified doctor with excellent academic credentials and surgery experience. ****** **** ******* ***** ** **** *** *** *** ******** **** * ************ ******* ",

Now it was on peak i searched and met several Drs but Saurabh Sir was the only one who answered all my queries and guided in details. Before meeting Saurabh sir i was very scared / sad for my father. But Saurabh sir helped me and we proceed for surgery. It was 7 days process now my father is very happy and can walks for a good distance. \n\nSaurabh sir is very polite, professional having very good behaviour and ethics for his patients. Anyone who is reading this, you can be sure of Dr Saurabh experience without searching for other Drs. He also have a very good team members /staff so i did not face any problem there Dr Saurabh treats me as family member. I never feel that i am in medical emergency.\n\nMe and my family will always pray for him. One day he will be the only one name in Asia region for best Spine surgeons.

We did try almost all soughts of therapies ranging from allopathy, naturopathy, alternate medicinal route like acupuncture and all but she was never relieved of this excruciating pain. While we were looking at specialists for expert opinion, someone suggested Dr Rawall. As he came highly recommended, we planned a visit. First interaction with him gave my mom so much confidence about the treatment,which in her mind she had assumed to be a lifelong pain, that she almost instantly agreed for this life improving surgery. Personally I have never ever came across a doctor who is so down to earth, who is all ears to his patients problems and doesn\u2019t carry fame on his sleeves. He has always been around for any doubts, queries, support that we needed during the process and ensured that my mom gets good post surgery care.We are still in awe of the fact that he took time to visit mom during Sunday\u2019s/Christmas holidays as that\u2019s the time when you usually don\u2019t expect them around in the hospital. \n\nHe keeps regular checks on his patients, and ensures that his team is available most of the time for any support that family might need during the process, and stay. \n\nHer surgery happened over Christmas weekend and with God\u2019s grace she is able to take small walks on her own. Slow and steady progress. She is able to make it only because of him. ",

Sometimes we get good hand holders, well-wishers and companion, those make this very easy and smooth. This is my Health Journey.\n\nFew months back, felt sciatica/ Numbness and severe back pain, This was not only back pain, its become kind of essence gone out of life. I tried all options suggested by friends, relatives and all well-wishers. And that highly myth and mis-conception to avoid spine surgery was there in my mind also after so many advises.\n\nMy health journey become very easy with God blessings and I found good doctor by luck. By the grace of God I met Dr. Saurabh Rawall, Apollo Hospitals Delhi, I specially loved and impressed how Dr. Saurabh really took his time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options. Discussed all my worries and post operations effects, Life after surgery. And my love of badminton also again come in my queries. I had a really positive visit and the doctor's approach and such a friendly attitude really put me at ease. There only I made my mind to go for surgery under him. \n\nHe is one of the best human being, whom I ever met. A very down to earth person with magical hands and skills as a Doctor. I took many opinions for surgery , met number of Doctors, but his true and positive feedback on my spine condition, made me comfortable for open spine surgery. He is always available for his patients , he even replied on Whatsapp on my reports and queries prior to my Apollo appointments.\n\nBefore and after operation his visits , meeting with my family members , update on my condition was really a feel of family member. After Operation when I became conscious , his smiling face with words \u201c How are your Rupesh\u201d , made me very comfortable.\n\nDuring my stay at Apollo, Never felt that we are in hospital, Well behaved staff, caring medical team. Doctors/ Nurses/Physiotherapist, all are dedicated and committed to patients.  \n\nNow, Almost one month after my surgery, Feeling comfortable and get rid of my back pain, Now with confidence, I can suggest that if anyone having spine issues , meet Dr. Saurabh in early stage of problem, Will be advised best of treatment. Me and my family really thankful & grateful to Dr. Saurabh  and his team for my successful spine surgery. Hope I will start badminton after few months as he advised. \n\n\n",

Our first conversation with Dr. Saurabh Rawall made us so comfortable that we decided at that point to go for it. He explained each and everything so clearly we were satisfied with of all of those. Then also we were having fear in us but by the Grace of God, Surgery was successful. The moment Sir told me surgery is Successful, I thank God and Dr Saurabh Rawall who dedicately gave so much of his time with Dr Alok Gupta. Thank you for everything that you have done for us; the hospital environment has always made me nervous, but you made it bearable. Thank you for all of your services.\nDr Saurabh Rawall is not the best doctor everyone expects but hardly finds.\n\nHis Assistant Dinesh is also a nice person.\nI pray to God that no one should have such disease but in any case if he or she have would really recommend Dr Saurabh Rawall undoubtedly.\nSuperheroes don\u2019t wear capes, they wear aprons and save us in our hard times.

Problem was started in Oct 23 from pain in arms and shoulders, after a week it slipped into paralysis of lower body with numbness/ stiffness. It was very dangerous for me as I was not able to walk, gut was involved so no motion for 2-3 days and due to this my office job and daily routine was disrupted. I searched for the best surgeons in Delhi NCR for approx. 3 months and consulted 14 -15 top spinal surgeons in Delhi NCR, underwent physiotherapy and sought homeopathic treatment, nothing worked, eventually, I met with Dr. Saurabh Rawall. He was convincing to my satisfaction; Dr. Saurabh, who made this surgery very simple and clear to me. ** ** *** **** ****** ******* * **** **** ** **** Very humble, soft spoken and highly intelligent surgeon. I was operated on 8 mar 24, now its almost 6 weeks post-surgery, the outcome of surgery is very good. All body tightness/ numbness has gone. Alhamdolillah recovering very well, walking to office, living normal daily routine. Many thanks to Dr. Saurabh for making this surgery highly successful. We have been listening from childhood about doctor\u2019s idealism and I must say Dr. Saurabh is a complete package with all good qualities of human doctor. I wish him a great success ahead.",

He has always advised me to exercise and keep the posture right. I did not pay attention to my health and finally had to opt for surgery after a couple of slip-disk episodes. Again, this was not the first or only option that Dr. Saurabh advised. However, when my MRIs showed that exercising will not help, he asked me to consider surgery. I visited doctors in AIIMS and Medanta for a second opinion. Shockingly I got terrible advice from AIIMS and Medanta doctor also gave me bleak scenarios. Dr. Saurabh\u2019s advice on what to expect during surgery and post-surgery recovery was spot-on. I was put at ease by his crew as well. My recovery has been easy. Dr. Saurabh has responded to my texts at odd hours when I needed his opinion. I would recommend Dr. Saurabh to anyone suffering from back-pain or needing spine surgery. He is an experienced and very well-qualified doctor with excellent academic credentials and surgery experience. ****** **** ******* ***** ** **** *** *** *** ******** **** * ************ ******* ",

I really surprised with his hard work he never missed to visit his patients before or after surgery without any follow up. \n\nMy Father had serious spine problem from 15 yrs. Now it was on peak i searched and met several Drs but Saurabh Sir was the only one who answered all my queries and guided in details. Before meeting Saurabh sir i was very scared / sad for my father. But Saurabh sir helped me and we proceed for surgery. It was 7 days process now my father is very happy and can walks for a good distance. \n\nSaurabh sir is very polite, professional having very good behaviour and ethics for his patients. Anyone who is reading this, you can be sure of Dr Saurabh experience without searching for other Drs. He also have a very good team members /staff so i did not face any problem there Dr Saurabh treats me as family member. I never feel that i am in medical emergency.\n\nMe and my family will always pray for him. One day he will be the only one name in Asia region for best Spine surgeons. I believe after some years every one will know Dr Saurabh for his work. Saurabh sir is god for us. Their hands are not a common man hand its hands of GOD for us. \n\nHe is highly recommended for your spinal problems.",

We did try almost all soughts of therapies ranging from allopathy, naturopathy, alternate medicinal route like acupuncture and all but she was never relieved of this excruciating pain. While we were looking at specialists for expert opinion, someone suggested Dr Rawall. As he came highly recommended, we planned a visit. First interaction with him gave my mom so much confidence about the treatment,which in her mind she had assumed to be a lifelong pain, that she almost instantly agreed for this life improving surgery. Personally I have never ever came across a doctor who is so down to earth, who is all ears to his patients problems and doesn\u2019t carry fame on his sleeves. He has always been around for any doubts, queries, support that we needed during the process and ensured that my mom gets good post surgery care.We are still in awe of the fact that he took time to visit mom during Sunday\u2019s/Christmas holidays as that\u2019s the time when you usually don\u2019t expect them around in the hospital. \n\nHe keeps regular checks on his patients, and ensures that his team is available most of the time for any support that family might need during the process, and stay. \n\nHer surgery happened over Christmas weekend and with God\u2019s grace she is able to take small walks on her own. Slow and steady progress. She is able to make it only because of him. ",

Sometimes we get good hand holders, well-wishers and companion, those make this very easy and smooth. This is my Health Journey.\n\nFew months back, felt sciatica/ Numbness and severe back pain, This was not only back pain, its become kind of essence gone out of life. I tried all options suggested by friends, relatives and all well-wishers. And that highly myth and mis-conception to avoid spine surgery was there in my mind also after so many advises.\n\nMy health journey become very easy with God blessings and I found good doctor by luck. By the grace of God I met Dr. Saurabh Rawall, Apollo Hospitals Delhi, I specially loved and impressed how Dr. Saurabh really took his time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options. Discussed all my worries and post operations effects, Life after surgery. And my love of badminton also again come in my queries. I had a really positive visit and the doctor's approach and such a friendly attitude really put me at ease. There only I made my mind to go for surgery under him. \n\nHe is one of the best human being, whom I ever met. A very down to earth person with magical hands and skills as a Doctor. I took many opinions for surgery , met number of Doctors, but his true and positive feedback on my spine condition, made me comfortable for open spine surgery. He is always available for his patients , he even replied on Whatsapp on my reports and queries prior to my Apollo appointments.\n\nBefore and after operation his visits , meeting with my family members , update on my condition was really a feel of family member. After Operation when I became conscious , his smiling face with words \u201c How are your Rupesh\u201d , made me very comfortable.\n\nDuring my stay at Apollo, Never felt that we are in hospital, Well behaved staff, caring medical team. Doctors/ Nurses/Physiotherapist, all are dedicated and committed to patients.  \n\nNow, Almost one month after my surgery, Feeling comfortable and get rid of my back pain, Now with confidence, I can suggest that if anyone having spine issues , meet Dr. Saurabh in early stage of problem, Will be advised best of treatment. Me and my family really thankful & grateful to Dr. Saurabh  and his team for my successful spine surgery. Hope I will start badminton after few months as he advised. \n\n\n",

We have checked our records and found that your appointment was at 3:45pm on 17 April. You reported to the OPD about 11 minutes late at 3:56 pm. And you asked for a refund at 4:31pm which was promptly given to you at 4:34 pm. Sir, when a patient is late for his appointment, we have to take in the next appointment or walk-in patient so as to optimize the utilization of clinic timings. Sometimes there are complicated cases needing extra time for examination and therefore the waiting time may be more than patient expectations. For the future, we assure that you will be seen within half an hour of your appointment time provided you report to the OPD at or before your appointment time. We wish you the best of health and a speedy recovery from your problem. ",
