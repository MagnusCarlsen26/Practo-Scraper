"Value for money,","Joint Mobilization,",0,0,NO,"The fee of Rs 1000/- for super citizen is too high.
The advise was so so commonly known. Extra expenditure of Rs 1500/- on X-Rray by other agency Sanya Diagnostics Hous Khas was also too high who didn’t grant me CGHS concession even when I showed my CGHS CARD no: 888077- Pensioner and they are on CGHS panel. Reason given was that payment has been already made and can’t be reversed. They should have also display ‘CGHS Panelisation’ at the reception and the reception should have disclosed to the patient before accepting much higher charges.
I wish this aspect be taken note of so that many more patients in this regard may not be unwarrantedly and unwaveringly charged higher amount disregarding their CGHS approved  charges.
