None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Gaurav govil is a very nice doctor very experienced. When a patient goes to visit a doctor first thing the most important for a patient is that the doctor listens to his or her patient calmly n fully... Which I experienced with him. He is so humble n polite, he makes you comfortable n makes you understand the problem and the solution of the problem. A positive nature of Dr Gaurav gives you positive vibes which heals the patient for 30â„… there n then. Thank you doctor",2022-03-29 05:25:20,False,True,Monica,,,
