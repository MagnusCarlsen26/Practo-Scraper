,,0,0,YES,"My mother had lot of shoulder pain. For 3-4 years she had to sleep one side only and experienced many sleepless nights . Number of Doctors were consulted and they all were prescribing some pain killers and calcium supplements which always provided a temporary relief. Finally, I consulted Dr.  Mahajan at BLK Max and it was by Chance( I had no prior information about him before that). . Based on Radiology  tests,  he suggested for Arthroscopic surgery. The surgery was sucessfully conducted  in December, 2021. From last 14 months,  my mother is feeling fine and can sleep both ways.  The pain is no more there.  The best thing about Dr.  Rakesh Mahajan and his team is that they explain each and every aspect of the problem, explain the radiology reports etc.  These things help the  patient to take right decision at right time and in right manner.
