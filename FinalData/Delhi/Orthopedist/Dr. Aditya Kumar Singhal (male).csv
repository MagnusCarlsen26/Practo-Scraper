"Explanation of the health issue,","Lower Back Pain,",0,0,YES,I am satisfied with the doctors consultation. But I am not satisfied with one thing that and this is happening with most of the doctors who are running their own clinic these doctors recommend those medicines which are only available in their pharmacy Lab. And Dr Aditya recommended the medicines which I was not able to purchase from anywhere in Delhi those medicines are only available in his clinic’s pharmacy. Ideally medicines should be Easily available with other medicine stores. But these doctors only recommend the medicines which are available in their pharmacy which ideally should not be the practice Because most of their medicines are very costly. So in terms of medicines I won’t recommend Dr Aditya Singhal to anybody. ,2021-09-21 08:58:55,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
