He looked up my records and suggested that there was a possible spinal issue responsible for the pain. Spinal issues can be lifelong problems, and this diagnosis let to a lot of worry and anxiety.

 Hospital visits are dictated by Hospital policy and usually we do have orthopedic surgeons as our assistant to take care of patients to support visits as was in ur case so it is my team reporting me and thus we avoid unnecessary visits which will add to financial burden of patient as every visit of mine in hospital will have to be recorded and charged by management. 
     Any professional charges r nt for seeing my wrk  but to maintain continuity of treatment as post surgical care is equally important and xray evaluation is just one part of it.Hope ur concerns are addressed.",2021-04-17T03:54:38+0000,Dr. Kamal Bachani
