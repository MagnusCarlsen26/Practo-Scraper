He recently performed a total knee replacement surgery on my mother at Venkateswar Hospital (Sector 18, Dwarka) and the entire experience was excellent.\n\nDr. Taneja is not only a skilled and experienced surgeon, but he is also incredibly kind, warm, and friendly. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure to my mother and our family, answering all of our questions patiently. His bedside manner is truly outstanding.\n\nThe coordinator, Kalpana, was also incredibly helpful and guided us every step of the way throughout the surgery and recovery process. She was very polite and responsive to our needs and concerns.\n\nThe surgery itself was a complete success, and my mother is now recovering well thanks to Dr. Taneja's expertise. We are so grateful for the care and attention he provided.\n\nI cannot recommend Dr. Ashish Taneja highly enough. If you are in need of an orthopedic surgeon in India, look no further than Dr. Taneja. He is truly one of the best doctors in the country.",

He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure to my mother and our family, answering all of our questions patiently. His bedside manner is truly outstanding.\n\nThe coordinator, Kalpana, was also incredibly helpful and guided us every step of the way throughout the surgery and recovery process. She was very polite and responsive to our needs and concerns.\n\nThe surgery itself was a complete success, and my mother is now recovering well thanks to Dr. Taneja's expertise. We are so grateful for the care and attention he provided.\n\nI cannot recommend Dr. Ashish Taneja highly enough. If you are in need of an orthopedic surgeon in India, look no further than Dr. Taneja. He is truly one of the best doctors in the country.",

My mother slipped a few days ago and got an injury in her right shoulder, due to which she was unable to lift her hand up without support. After getting her MRI done, we came to know that there is a tendon tear/rotator cuff tear in her right shoulder. Someone in the family referred to consult Dr. Ashish. We visited him at Delhi Bone & Joint Clinic in Janak Puri. He suggested that the only solution for this is a Rotator cuff repair surgery. Dr. Ashish planned the complete surgery and was in connect with us throughout the period. The best thing about Dr. Ashish is that he always reverts to messages on time and keeps himself connected with the patient/attendant as a family member. This gives a lot of confidence and faith to the patient that he/she is in the right hands. We are extremely satisfied with Dr. Ashish's treatment, surgery and advices he has given for the post surgery recovery. I highly recommend him, he is a great surgeon.\u00a0\ud83d\udc4d",

                "review_text": "Dr. Ashish gave me ample time to speak about the issues I am facing. However incoherent I sounded, he patiently heard me out, questioned where necessary and gave me extensive answers . It helped me gain clarity and gave me some respite which was missing since long. Also, he helped me chart out a future course of action with proper follow ups and no overloading of medications and tests.\nHis approach of empathy and making every aspect of my narrative important helped me also put things into the right perspective.  It goes a long way in building a bond with a doctor , a person ,you know, you are entrusting your life or the life of your loved ones with.\nThe straight forward, simplistic yet thoroughly professional approach is what sets Dr. Ashish apart.\nThank you for making a difference with love ,joy ,patience and above all with the insights which help a person trust you and the prescribed treatments.",
