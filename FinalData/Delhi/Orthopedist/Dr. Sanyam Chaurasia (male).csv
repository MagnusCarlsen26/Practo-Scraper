"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,NO,"It was a opd case but they admitted urgently at 10:30 am in morning and done lots of test, x-ray, MRI ***** *** *** ********* After admitted in room, no doctor came to check the reason for severe back pain till 7 in evening despite patient was unable to sit or stand or to move. In evening he came to tell for physiotherapy for some days.

Next day we decided to leave and take physiotherapy at home knowing the huge amount of bill
