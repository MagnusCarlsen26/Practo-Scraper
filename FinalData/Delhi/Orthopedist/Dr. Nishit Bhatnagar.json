I had a fracture in my right leg due to a bike accident, and Dr. Nishit was my treating doctor. He treated me very well, listened to me carefully, and maintained complete transparency in my treatment, from medications to the overall process. The staff at Sama Hospital was also very good. I had booked an appointment for a specific time, and there was no extra waiting required. They also provided clear guidance on how to take the medicines.",
