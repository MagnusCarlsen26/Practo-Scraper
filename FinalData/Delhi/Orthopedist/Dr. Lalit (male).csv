"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,Meniscus Injury,ACL Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I recently underwent an ACL and meniscus tear surgery, performed by Dr. Lalit, and I would **highly** recommend trusting him for your care. From start to finish, the experience was as seamless as you can possibly make it. Everyone I came into contact with at his office and throughout my procedure were extremely competent, thorough, and professional. They went above and beyond in meeting my needs, both physically and in terms of paperwork.

Dr. Lalit has very quickly gained my trust, as well as that of my family & friends, both critical in this experience. A friend recommended Dr. Lalit, and he was able to fit me in for a quick appointment. From the experience of my friends before, and my initial interactions, I felt confident in the fact that Dr. Lalit had a conservative approach to care, and did not want to rush me to surgery.
   
After getting my MRI results, we confirmed it was a very serious tear, with high surgery potential. I kept delaying the surgery, in hopes that I may not need one. I had the opinion of one more doctor at AIIMS as well as medical friends, who supported Dr. Lalit’s evaluation. When the pain got unexpectedly worse, I got directly in touch with him, and he immediately scheduled me for an appointment and booked the procedure for the very next day. The surgery went extremely well.

I was walking the day of surgery again, the scar healed wonderfully, and 2 weeks later, I was back at work. I am incredibly thankful for how well taken care of and confident I felt during what could have been an extremely frightening experience. Thank you, Dr. Lalit.

He is very calm and patient, explains everything which needs to be done. Too often surgeons suggest surgery as an instant fix for problems, but he was just the opposite. He is a very professional doctor and I would definitely recommend him.
He was extremely positive I would fully recover within 6-8 weeks and get back into my active lifestyle. He never gave me any longer-term daily medications. 
I could not stand the pain in my shoulders, and immediately, he gave a (if i am not mistaken) cortisone injection. He suggested that we get an MRI. The MRI report confirmed that this was a herniated disc in C4-C5, but it was very positive, he told me to keep taking my physical therapy sessions, and yeah, slowly, I started healing, and now I feel much better. 
His diagnosis, how he treated my case was unbelievable. He is doing such a good job.
I am getting close to getting my normal life back. By next month, I should get back into a routine at the gym.     
I feel no tingling feeling, and I am able to move my left arm correctly. My neck area stiffness feels actually less than before. Previously, I would get that burning feeling in my left shoulder constantly. I no longer feel like this. 
He even suggested the way I should sit, and worked on my sitting and sleeping posture. It has helped me out so much. Thank you so much doctor!
