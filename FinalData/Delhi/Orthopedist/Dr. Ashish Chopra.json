Although a virtual consult owing to my knee injury, Dr Chopra not only gave me a patient hearing, but also answered all my queries, prescribed the at home care and medicines process very nicely. I experienced immediate relief with the meds prescribed and this has only strengthened my belief in his expertise. With a multitude of joint related concerns I look forward to consulting him in person when I'm back on my feet. I recommend him highly for anyone looking for the correct Diagnosis and best treatment.",
