IMO* ** ** *** **** ***** ******* ** ******  He is very friendly and responds to even WhatsApp messages with a return call.  His team is excellent.  Dr. Veenu is the most friendly physiotherapist I have met.  Pushkar,  who supports patients in deciding on the hospital and helping them to navigate insurance issues is top-class.  Pushkar made our life so easy and we did not have to worry about insurance claim processes.  I strongly recommend Dr. Abhishek and his team for your ortho-related needs. ",

He spent lot of time explaining the issue and also discussed treatment options in detail. My parents being qualified medical doctors themselves were really impressed by the fact that how Dr. Mishra explains complex medical issues in simple terms for a layman.\n\nWe decided to go ahead with a knee replacement surgery under supervision of Dr. Mishra. Again, he was very transparent with everything associated with this procedure and answered every question (how so ever trivial) in detail. \n\nThe surgery went very smooth and even though there is pain and discomfort associated with any medical procedure, Dr. Mishra visited my mother daily and made sure that necessary care is extended to her. He also remained in close connect with Physiotherapist to ensure that the exercise routine is updated based on the evolving medical needs of my mother.\n\nThis review will remain incomplete without mentioning the wonderful team Dr. Mishra have with him. Special mention and thanks to Mr. Pushkar for always being with us for any question and help. He went way beyond what you would normally expect  to ensure that the best care is provided to my mother.\n\n",

Today, after 1 year, I can vote for him for all the expertise he has. For any doctor, the very important thing is his/her patients is comfortable so he and his staff made sure of that. \n\nTo start with my first meeting, I was little late because of traffic so he made sure to meet me than just leave. He explained everything in detail and suggested to go for both knee replacement together. More than me, he took away fear from my mom which was more important. Not only with the treatment, he also made sure discussing my financial comfort and helped me with all stress free arrangement at Apollo spectra. \n\nI can keep writing pages but in short, he and his team, specially Pushkar made weekly visits for more than a month to check how my mom is doing and how physio results are. As promised, my mom could stand after a day and walk with support after a week. After 2 months, my mom called me and she was in tears of happiness that she walked around 2 km outside home and very happy with her freedom. Till date, if me or my mom calls doctor office, they respond and recognize us well. \n\nTruly, very humbled and admired by your personality. I am sure, you must have helped many others in last one year. All the blessings and success to you and your team.   ",

Everytime a cast is applied patients are instructed to wear the same. Despite repeated emphasis some patients do not follow the advice and come back with a broken cast.\nThe natural course of injuries are different in different people depending on the body response and it would be wrong to predict the exact outcome in each and every individual. That is why follow ups are suggested.\nIt would be wrong to say that doctor is always not available as the doctor has to be in surgery as well and that is why the concept of prior appointment.\n'only interested in consultation money' statement has probably arisen out of a discontent and biased opinion.\nWould request you to kindly fix up an appointment with me.\nWould ensure that your queries are attended to personally.\nThanx and regards\nDr Abhishek ",

He spent lot of time explaining the issue and also discussed treatment options in detail. My parents being qualified medical doctors themselves were really impressed by the fact that how Dr. Mishra explains complex medical issues in simple terms for a layman.\n\nWe decided to go ahead with a knee replacement surgery under supervision of Dr. Mishra. Again, he was very transparent with everything associated with this procedure and answered every question (how so ever trivial) in detail. \n\nThe surgery went very smooth and even though there is pain and discomfort associated with any medical procedure, Dr. Mishra visited my mother daily and made sure that necessary care is extended to her. He also remained in close connect with Physiotherapist to ensure that the exercise routine is updated based on the evolving medical needs of my mother.\n\nThis review will remain incomplete without mentioning the wonderful team Dr. Mishra have with him. Special mention and thanks to Mr. Pushkar for always being with us for any question and help. He went way beyond what you would normally expect  to ensure that the best care is provided to my mother.\n\n",

The relationship is not lost even after so many visits/calls from outstation and have been treated with respect throughout.\n\nHis way of treatment and explanations persuaded me to recommend him whenever I certainly  across any case of orthopedic doctor. My colleague was satisfactorily operated for a problem. And recently met him again for my uncle, where he also shared the same experience.\n\nWithout doubt, visit him if required. \n\nThanks Doctor !

Today, after 1 year, I can vote for him for all the expertise he has. For any doctor, the very important thing is his/her patients is comfortable so he and his staff made sure of that. \n\nTo start with my first meeting, I was little late because of traffic so he made sure to meet me than just leave. He explained everything in detail and suggested to go for both knee replacement together. More than me, he took away fear from my mom which was more important. Not only with the treatment, he also made sure discussing my financial comfort and helped me with all stress free arrangement at Apollo spectra. \n\nI can keep writing pages but in short, he and his team, specially Pushkar made weekly visits for more than a month to check how my mom is doing and how physio results are. As promised, my mom could stand after a day and walk with support after a week. After 2 months, my mom called me and she was in tears of happiness that she walked around 2 km outside home and very happy with her freedom. Till date, if me or my mom calls doctor office, they respond and recognize us well. \n\nTruly, very humbled and admired by your personality. I am sure, you must have helped many others in last one year. All the blessings and success to you and your team.   ",

Lots of patience, confidence, huge experience and  excellent skills made the magic and after few weeks she was on her feet again without any surgery! I would highly recommend Dr Abhishek ! ",

For a clinic that gives the appointment at 6pm, he hadn't even turned up till 8pm. Very disappointing as a patient to travel all the way with all the pain and everything in vain. Can understand the possibility of an exigency but can't understand the lack of basic courtesy to keep a patient informed. Won't go there myself and won't recommend visiting him if you are a stickler of time.  ",

Everytime a cast is applied patients are instructed to wear the same. Despite repeated emphasis some patients do not follow the advice and come back with a broken cast.\nThe natural course of injuries are different in different people depending on the body response and it would be wrong to predict the exact outcome in each and every individual. That is why follow ups are suggested.\nIt would be wrong to say that doctor is always not available as the doctor has to be in surgery as well and that is why the concept of prior appointment.\n'only interested in consultation money' statement has probably arisen out of a discontent and biased opinion.\nWould request you to kindly fix up an appointment with me.\nWould ensure that your queries are attended to personally.\nThanx and regards\nDr Abhishek ",

                "reply_text": "Dear friend ;\nThese days for meniscal tear in young patients arthroscopic meniscal repair is being done routinely World over.It is a minimally invasive surgery and hundreds of such surgery are being performed every week all over the world.\nIn fact \u2018save the meniscus \u2018is the idea which is more pertinent for younger generation so whenever a young patient with a meniscal tear approaches an orthopaedic surgeon it becomes more of a duty of the surgeon to inform the patient about this treatment option.It is up to the patient to take the call whether he or she wants to undergo the knife as none can force surgery upon a patient.A doctor can just counsel the patient about the options available.\n\nAbout the medication, everybody knows it is not a good idea to take painkillers for a long time and it is a common practice to use nutritional and pharmaceutical supplements for the purpose of repair and healing.As these are not painkillers they take a longer time to have their effect (what you are calling a long course )\nIn fact Rs.8000-Rs.10,000 is too little a price to pay for saving a knee without surgery.It is not only highly unlikely but completely impossible that anybody in my clinic would directly or obliquely suggest you to buy these medicines at my clinic pharmacy only.These medicines are widely available outside and everybody is welcome to buy it at their convenience.The pharmacy at the clinic is for convenience of patients who want all the important facilities under one roof.Medicines manufactured / marketed in the capital of a country cannot be called local and the same medicines from foreign brands and foreign manufacturers cost at least 3 to 4 times more which many people would happily buy thinking if it is manufactured outside India it will work better little knowing the fact that India is one of the largest exporter of pharmaceutical products worldwide.Similarly generics can be available at a lower price but sometimes the quality of generics can be questionable. I am really not sure about the doctors with whom these medicines were cross checked because I am pretty convinced that any busy orthopaedic surgeon worth his salt would have the luxury of having free time to advise you about just the medication prescribed by other orthopaedic colleague and considering you consulted many other Orthopaedic surgeons (Doctor\u2019s )it is obvious the money you spent in consulting these doctors must have been way more expensive than the cost of these medicines which you are finding expensive or not reasonable.A doctor can only attempt to treat the condition With evidence-based and prevalent practises .A personal whim and a biased opinion helps neither the Doctor nor the patient.\nWishing you a speedy recovery\nRegards\nDr Abhishek",
