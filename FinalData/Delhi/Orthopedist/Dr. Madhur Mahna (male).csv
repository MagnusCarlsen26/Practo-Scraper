I'm sorry to see that your experience was not as per your expectations.
1. Average fee for an orthopedic surgeon in Delhi is ₹800. My fee is 600.

2. Two views of any part in any X-ray centre costs 800-900 rupees, except for special offers, or charitable clinics. 
While at my centre, which is NOT charitable, the X-ray for two views is 700, and we normally reduce the cost to 600.
Either way, any patient is free to get an xray or any other investigation from anywhere they feel like.

3. An intra-articular injection is an expert procedure which can be given only by a specialist. So the charges are not for consumables, but for the procedure. Just like when you consult a doctor, you are only exchanging words, which is basically air, which ais for free, but you still pay a fee for the knowledge, skill and the treatment prescribed by the doctor, regardless of whether she/he gives anything material in your hand, the price of which you can search on the internet.
🙏🏻

I hope I am made my point clear.
Hope you get well soon

I’m sorry that your experience was not as pleasant as you expected it to be.
I’m a little taken aback by your comment that your queries were left unsolved. Because You did not ask many questions about your problem in the first place, moreover you never reviewed with the investigations which were advised, so you left the treatment incomplete.
All my patients have total liberty to call me up whenever they have a query.
You also have the option of Practo Consult where a follow up question can be asked on the app itself, which you didnot use.
Whenever I prescribe a medicine I describe each one of them in detail to every patient. So there are never any secrets there.
Since you never got the investigations, and you yourself wrote that you didn’t take the medicines either, expecting a favourable result would be unfair.
Either way, I pray that your problem goes away

It’s unfortunate that you had to face a problem in finding the medicines at some other pharmacy.
I have kept a medicine counter at the centre itself for the CONVENIENCE of the patient so that he/she can get everything at a single stop.

The fact that the pharmacies you went to didn’t recognise the medicines is a reflection of their lack of knowledge.

The only criteria I have of prescribing a medicine is its result.
If given a choice between prescribing a  ‘popular’ medicine which is easily available but has a sub optimal effect, and another medicine which might not be easily available but has better results, I will choose the latter one any day.

Moreover, internet apps never were, and never will be, my criteria of prescribing a medicine.
It will be a sad day for the medical profession if a random smart phone app gets to decide whether a qualified doctor, who has dedicated the prime of his life to studying medicine, is prescribing the correct drugs or not.

All of my patients have the liberty to buy medicines from anywhere they feel like, and to revert back to me if any medicine is unavailable. I would gladly explain the ingredients to the pharmacist so that they can provide an alternative.

Praying for your speedy recovery

1. I don't understand what did you mean when you mentioned that the staff was ""making accords"". The staff do their job as per the protocol issued by the treating doctor. All the services have fixed prices which were explained to you. No one forced any patient to take any services.
Kindly refrain using such language unbecoming a decent citizen.

2. No one at any clinic, especially mine, can be forced to give the patient anything. A particular treatment is prescribed and it's the patients choice to take the treatment or not. 
You were not advised any Vit D3 injection, and the patient who was given a Vit D3 injection in front of you, gave me a five star review on practo itself.
So kindly refrain from making such atrocious accusations and also refrain from giving opinions on behalf of other patients.

3. All the invoices are absolutely legal and follow all government guidelines for medical clinics. Sir Please don't comment on things you don't know about.

At our centre all practices are absolutely fair and legal, and they routinely go through government checks.

While respecting the opinion of every patient, it is also essential to clear out facts, and to answer fo such atrocious baseless accusations.

 I wish you all the best for the future.
