"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Bone Fracture Repair,",0,0,YES,"
Had a wonderful Experience with the Doctor. He recently performed a high risk surgery on my Grandmother who is 88 years old . She fell and fractured her hip bone, and surgery was the only way to treat her. Once all the pre-tests were done, it was concluded that she is highly unfit for the surgery due to her heart condition as well, hence Anesthesiologist refused to proceed. However,  the Doctor was very confident that he could perform the surgery , which speaks volumes about his experience and skills in his field. This put a lot of confidence in us as well and we were ready to go ahead with the surgery , Although we had to move my grandmother to a different hospital in which the Doctor also helped us a lot.

Finally the surgery was successfully done and my Grandmother is safe and back home, still recovering though. However, the Doctor is still in touch with us for all the post operation procedures.

He indeed is great and supremely skilled in his field, and the best thing I appreciate and grateful for is that he stayed in touch ever after the treatment was over and happy to help and answer any concerns we have over the phone , Highly recommended !!
