"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Spinal Therapy,",0,0,YES,"I went to meet him for lower back pain. Within minutes he found out what is the cause. He was honest in telling that exercise and posture correction will bring more relief rather than medicine.Lots of Doctors would have prescribed unnecessary and costly medicines, he did not do that. Many doctors would have asked for costly testss like spinal MRI. He said clearly ,these tests are not needed.
