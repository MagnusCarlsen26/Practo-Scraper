We decided to go ahead with a knee replacement surgery under supervision of Dr. Mishra. Again, he was very transparent with everything associated with this procedure and answered every question (how so ever trivial) in detail. 

The surgery went very smooth and even though there is pain and discomfort associated with any medical procedure, Dr. Mishra visited my mother daily and made sure that necessary care is extended to her. He also remained in close connect with Physiotherapist to ensure that the exercise routine is updated based on the evolving medical needs of my mother.

This review will remain incomplete without mentioning the wonderful team Dr. Mishra have with him. Special mention and thanks to Mr. Pushkar for always being with us for any question and help. He went way beyond what you would normally expect  to ensure that the best care is provided to my mother.

These days for meniscal tear in young patients arthroscopic meniscal repair is being done routinely World over.It is a minimally invasive surgery and hundreds of such surgery are being performed every week all over the world.
In fact ‘save the meniscus ‘is the idea which is more pertinent for younger generation so whenever a young patient with a meniscal tear approaches an orthopaedic surgeon it becomes more of a duty of the surgeon to inform the patient about this treatment option.It is up to the patient to take the call whether he or she wants to undergo the knife as none can force surgery upon a patient.A doctor can just counsel the patient about the options available.

About the medication, everybody knows it is not a good idea to take painkillers for a long time and it is a common practice to use nutritional and pharmaceutical supplements for the purpose of repair and healing.As these are not painkillers they take a longer time to have their effect (what you are calling a long course )
In fact Rs.8000-Rs.10,000 is too little a price to pay for saving a knee without surgery.It is not only highly unlikely but completely impossible that anybody in my clinic would directly or obliquely suggest you to buy these medicines at my clinic pharmacy only.These medicines are widely available outside and everybody is welcome to buy it at their convenience.The pharmacy at the clinic is for convenience of patients who want all the important facilities under one roof.Medicines manufactured / marketed in the capital of a country cannot be called local and the same medicines from foreign brands and foreign manufacturers cost at least 3 to 4 times more which many people would happily buy thinking if it is manufactured outside India it will work better little knowing the fact that India is one of the largest exporter of pharmaceutical products worldwide.Similarly generics can be available at a lower price but sometimes the quality of generics can be questionable. I am really not sure about the doctors with whom these medicines were cross checked because I am pretty convinced that any busy orthopaedic surgeon worth his salt would have the luxury of having free time to advise you about just the medication prescribed by other orthopaedic colleague and considering you consulted many other Orthopaedic surgeons (Doctor’s )it is obvious the money you spent in consulting these doctors must have been way more expensive than the cost of these medicines which you are finding expensive or not reasonable.A doctor can only attempt to treat the condition With evidence-based and prevalent practises .A personal whim and a biased opinion helps neither the Doctor nor the patient.
Wishing you a speedy recovery
