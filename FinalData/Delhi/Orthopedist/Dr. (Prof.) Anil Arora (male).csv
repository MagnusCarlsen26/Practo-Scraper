None,"Knee Pain,",0,0,YES,Dr. Anil Arora is a really good doctor and takes very good care of the patient. He is able to explain the problem of the patient to even a layman and always gives ample time to patient. The Clinic is very well maintained and the staff is also very co-operative. Dr. Anil Arora is expert in his area of Orthopaedics. He ensures that patient understands the treatment plan. He is very good at communicating the exact problems and how he plans to cure the patient. Most importantly he seemed more worried about curing the patient rather than only focusing on money. He never suggests any costly tests or medicines until and unless it is necessary for the patient.,2016-04-20 08:52:26,False,True,Gaurav Srivastava,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Avascular Necrosis Treatment & Management,",0,0,YES,"A genuine gentleman is what would summarize Dr. Arora.
He didnt ask me get any extra x ray done either and said that your July x ray is sufficient as he could decipher based upon my leg movement that the previous x ray is sufficient and a new one is not required.
Every doctor i have seen till date asks to get x ray done from their facility and definitely earn some profit.
Where my hip join would eventually require a replacement however he said that we cant do surgery purely on our guess that it might require surgery 3-4 or may be 10 years later. Who knows - a surgery might never be required.
The world we are living in - doctors advice expensive surgery wherever there is an opportunity.
Here i was mentally prepared for a surgery but Dr. Arora denied it and prescribed only medicines.
