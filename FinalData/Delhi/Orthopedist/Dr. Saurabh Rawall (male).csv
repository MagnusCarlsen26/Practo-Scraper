We thank you for the time you have put in writing this feedback. We understand the difficulty you faced while waiting for your turn to see the doctor.

And you asked for a refund at 4:31pm which was promptly given to you at 4:34 pm. Sir, when a patient is late for his appointment, we have to take in the next appointment or walk-in patient so as to optimize the utilization of clinic timings. Sometimes there are complicated cases needing extra time for examination and therefore the waiting time may be more than patient expectations. For the future, we assure that you will be seen within half an hour of your appointment time provided you report to the OPD at or before your appointment time.
