He possesses great empathy for his patients . I had met an bike accident that caused very severe injury to my knee. For months i was helpless and without any improvement even after spending majority of my financial savings. I visited many named orthopedist and let my savings flow in their pocket with a hope that i will be able to walk again but everything went into vein. I had completely lost my faith to doctors .  I visited the honourable \u201cDr lalit lohia\u201d having same mindset that i developed during past few months of my struggling among other doctors and thought i wont get any improvement in my health from him also (since i had lost my faith to doctors n was completely hopeless). But after my first consultation with him , he filled me with a new hope that i never thought would come to me. Ohh god , that man was so charmful that i still cant forget my first visit to him. I was filled with a new positiveness about my health when i left his office. He even didnt charge his consultation fee after hearing my story of suffering and stumbling from one doctor to another. I was not only able to walk but i was able to run with no discomfort at all and that too within  4weeks under his treatment. He is the man who restored my faith on doctors. I think apart from great knowledge and precise skills , that man throws huge vibe of positiveness towards his patients that half of your illness will be cured once you leave his office. When it comes to an orthopedist , i\u2019ve never visited any other doctor since then. That man is truly an art of god. ",
