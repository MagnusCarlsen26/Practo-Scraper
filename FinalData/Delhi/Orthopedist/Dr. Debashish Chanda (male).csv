This is not the 1 st time, last time you did the same when your wife was getting treated at ck birla hospital for some other issue. You wrote the similar abusive words for all doctors( including me), when we have done nothing wrong. You and your wife might have a personal issue, you can’t always take doctors for a ride. 
Lets start from the beginning. I don’t remember I, have ever given less time to you during your visits. I always tried to give you proper explanations, to smallest of your queries. You came for acl repair ages after your initial injury. In my detailed discussion I, had explained to you about all of the outcome due to delayed reconstruction. I don’t think I, have taken any less time in explaining and convincing you about the surgery, if you want to call this Marketting I can’t help. Thats a genuine good gesture from a doctor. My idea is to explain everything before any procedure, so that the patient should understand the problem and he/she should not be unnecessarily worried.
Your surgery was completely successful and i do remember sending you the video of surgery from my phone as YOU forgot to collect it from OT before discharge. No hospital provides such surgical videos to the patient. we are the only hospital doing so, the only thing is you need to collect it in a pen drive ( as large size video). Many a times patient don’t collect and hospital can’t store it for long due to space crunch. We keep all details of end result of every patient so that we can remember what we did in the surgery. The same video i have given you through my phone & I clearly remember that.
The clicking noise your talking about is very common due to cartilage damage which is also very common after delayed acl surgery and it may stay or disappear with time. Again it is not because of the surgery we did, but depends on how meticulously and dedicatedly you follow the rehab regimen. 
At 3 months of surgery i still remember that i was very happy with the recovery and told you about the new acl strength is exceptionally good.
I don’t remember in all 3 months i have ever tried to avoid your questions or queries. I have replied every if and buts you had.
You had some issues with your wife’s treatment at the same hospital and the different doctor treating your wife. You tried to pull my name only to get discount and fee waver from hospital. ( what else a MNC company sales executive will do!!)
After doing so much harm to my reputation without my fault, you had the audacity to come back to me. This time after a fight with your wife where you injured your operated knee. Truly saying, that day i was not at all interested in examining you, because of your wrong doing and mal aligning my honour. But as a doctor i cant refuse my duties even if we are treating enemies. 
As far as i remember, it was the injury after 5 months which started causing problem to your knee. I don’t take responsibility for that , and also someone like you who can say any bad word for others for personal gain. And thats why I, refused to treat you further. I still remember that I specifically told you to choose any doctor of your choice. As you have broken the doctor patient relationship and I don’t regret it at all.
I know only one thing those who do good for others get better in return. May God give you wisdom and peace.",2020-05-03T03:24:22+0000,Dr. Debashish Chanda

Also, X-ray is an essential part of diagnosis, hence was advised. If your were unwilling, you were absolutely free to deny and walk out.
Regarding the second consultation (after 4 wks of medication)- your forearm was completely normal on examination.

Thanks for the response. I am very happy that you have given me the chance to explain the issue.
You came to me for your wife’s consultation along with your child. I presume you brought your child as you had no other choice on a Saturday evening, which is fine. 
To let you know, my Saturdays are always the busiest with scheduled morning surgeries and exhausting evening OPDs. The Saturday evening you visited was no better. When u visited me at 7pm, I was almost drained but I don’t expect the patients to care about the doctor. While examining other patients scheduled before you, I had to try really hard to even listen to them because your kid was screaming outside. The moment you and your wife came inside your kid started howling and even conversation regarding the history of illness with your wife was difficult. And that's when I requested you to go outside with your child and pacify her. I’m sure this makes sense. This made the consultation with the patient & explanation of illness a lot easier. I was sorry to have asked you to take your kid out for which I apologized to your wife. 
I am not in a hospitality business where I would cater to your whims ignoring my own job. For me, a good experience  is all about listening to patients and trying my best to help cure their problems. I hope you must be intelligent enough with a proper “degree” to understand this and care about these little things on your next visit to doctor. Try to be a little less intolerant and more empathic. 
I wish you and your family well.

For last 4 years, you were suffering from back pain and for last 4 months you were not able to move properly with significant morning stiffness. Before consulting me, you had done 2months of physiotherapy but no improvement. You did all sorts of monkey exercises suggested by your acquaintances in front of me which i patiently observed knowing it was of no relevance. I dedicated my precious time and ear to your rubbish talks (apart from the significant history) and observed your antics. Whereas, diagnosis of ur problem should not take more than 2 mins with proper history taking and skilled examination which i believe i did. 
My dear Mr.  Ravi, please get yourself checked for ankylosing spondylitis. I have adviced you tests which are very important for confirmation of diagnosis. 
Even the doctor you consulted before me suggested the same tests. Either you live in denial or get proper treatment. If you want to live in denial then plz don’t waste any other doctor’s time as our time is precious. I don’t feel i have explained you any less. I deliberately didn’t explain you about ankylosing spondylitis in details as I did not want to scare you until it was confirmed.

Thanks for your response

Sometimes its very difficult to diagnose problem in one go. And sometimes even more difficult if patients comes with one joint pain and cause is a different joint.
Evaluation is the thing which as a doctor I can do. I remember seeing you twice once i told you to get some xrays, and gave medications and physiotherapy to solve ur issue. 
Unfortunately there was no improvement. Which happens many a times and will lead to further evaluation. But being a patient i can just tell you this that sometimes you need to keep patience for treatment. 
I don’t have any magic wand to heal everyone, its based on examination, evaluation and trial treatment we doctors treat patients. Hope you will understand. I also want your speedy recovery but not always we as doctor can deliver that. I would request please have patience for that, i can assure you that you will be better. I also keep thinking about patients who don’t get improvement with treatment and will do my best to delivery better results. 
My last request is please discuss your problem and concern when you come to visit doctor. Writing on practo platform may not help you as… I really don’t know you will read it or not?
So if read it and you read my reply, plz visit again and will try to treat your problem if its not solved yet.!

With your problem being 6months old i have adviced you medications for the 1st time.. but it is possible that you might not get relief… i have adviced you tests after 4wks of 1st check up.. and those are needed as you have not improved.. no one can guarantee for treatment with 1 st check-up… choosing homeopathy for further is your choice completely!!… but remember your are the one who left the treatment in middle without even proper diagnosis…

Regarding appointment - I can not guarantee a zero-minute or a fixed wait time as different patients may require varying amount of time for checkup and counseling depending on the ailment. Some patients may have complex conditions that require more time and attention, while others may have simple issues that can be addressed quickly. Additionally, unexpected emergencies or delays can arise, causing appointments to run longer than expected. It is therefore crucial to understand that one needs to be flexible and patient when scheduling appointments with a doctor. I was only busy seeing patients without a break. 
Regarding your consultation - I spent around 20
minutes with you, took a detailed medical history, examined you, explained to you in details about “necessary” medications and physiotherapy exercises that u would have required. If you feel it was quick, it’s your problem not mine. 
I agree that I skipped on writing investigations like X- rays or MRI because I felt it was unnecessary with your history of 2 wks back pain due to travel and exertion.

I am apologetic about the experience. But i would like to explain what happened. you. Usually saturday is a super busy day. Most of the patients want to show on Saturday as its a off day for many. You have taken a walk-in opd slot even though you have sustained a trauma/ injury. (You Should have gone to emergency directly but many patients come to save the emergency charges). I have seen you in my opd even after that and adviced you to get a pain injection and and xray. I remember I specifically adviced you to stay in emergency and i will come to see you there with your xrays. (Without any emergency charges) 
But you seemed to be in too hurry and came back again to opd for which my coordinator explained to go back to emergency. Now if you don’t follow the instructions and want to jumble between opd and emergency to skip lines, thats not right. Patient word its self has come from patience, you should have patience.
I have explained about the need of plaster for which you have refused which i have explained is your wish. I have spent full required time with you to full fil your queries. Now treatment can’t be according to your choice.
