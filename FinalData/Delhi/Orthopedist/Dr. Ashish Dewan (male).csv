"Value for money,","Foot Pain,",0,0,NO,Different fee on Practo vs actual charged. Ask to pay through Practo but no option was available. Diagnostic x-rays no. can be reduced initially by doctor judgement. Elevator in IBS was not operational. It was a real tough time for patients going downstairs for x-rays having leg injury. Elevator should not be non operational for a min in hospital. In nutshell my no is for the IBS hospital and not for doctor. Dr can be consulted at other location for surgery.,2019-08-05 05:20:51,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
