My aunt visited him for a knee replacement surgery one year ago, and she has been doing great ever since. The surgery was a success, and she has been able to return to her normal activities without any pain. My uncle also recently visited Dr. Sharma for a rotator cuff repair. The surgery was also a success, and he is already feeling much better. He was able to return to work after just a few weeks.\nI was very impressed with Dr. Sharma's knowledge, skill, and bedside manner. He took the time to explain my aunt and uncle's conditions in detail and answer all of our questions. He also made sure that they were comfortable and informed throughout the entire process.\nThe facilities at the clinic were clean and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Dr. Sharma to anyone who is considering joint replacement surgery.",

I researched for the best orthopedists in Noida mostly over the net, and found that Dr Sharma is very qualified for the job. We were very happy anticipating good health for my father. So, I reached hospital early morning today to get an appointment between 1PM-2PM. Luckily I got the first appointment of the day,  my wife and my father visited the doctor during that given slot. When I called them later the day I came to know that the consultation took place but both of them are really disappointed and it was one of their bad experiences. All their hopes fallen flat and they returned home with an appointment with another orthopedist...\nWe are not losing hope in humanity, *** ****** *** ** **** ******* *** **** ** ***** we will try again with some other orthopedist in some where else.

Today he runs a bike with the same hand, he also typing, and even more weight is also very comfortable. Defense takes.\n2.  Five years ago, my father-in-law was very troubled by the pain of the knee. Sushil Sharma advised us to knee Replacement, Dad was very scared but he explained it with so much love and trust that he recognized, and not only did he assist us in the operating expenses. Today, my father is free from the pain of his feet due to Dr. Sushil and the ladder also climbs and runs. Whenever I find out the complaint of any bone, I always recommend the name of Dr. Sushil Sharma.** **** **** ***** ** ** ***** **** ****** **** *** ****** ****** ** ***** *** ** *** ***** ******",

He took the time to explain my aunt and uncle's conditions in detail and answer all of our questions.

I researched for the best orthopedists in Noida mostly over the net, and found that Dr Sharma is very qualified for the job. We were very happy anticipating good health for my father. So, I reached hospital early morning today to get an appointment between 1PM-2PM. Luckily I got the first appointment of the day,  my wife and my father visited the doctor during that given slot. When I called them later the day I came to know that the consultation took place but both of them are really disappointed and it was one of their bad experiences. All their hopes fallen flat and they returned home with an appointment with another orthopedist...\nWe are not losing hope in humanity, *** ****** *** ** **** ******* *** **** ** ***** we will try again with some other orthopedist in some where else.

Today he runs a bike with the same hand, he also typing, and even more weight is also very comfortable. Defense takes.\n2.  Five years ago, my father-in-law was very troubled by the pain of the knee. Sushil Sharma advised us to knee Replacement, Dad was very scared but he explained it with so much love and trust that he recognized, and not only did he assist us in the operating expenses. Today, my father is free from the pain of his feet due to Dr. Sushil and the ladder also climbs and runs. Whenever I find out the complaint of any bone, I always recommend the name of Dr. Sushil Sharma.** **** **** ***** ** ** ***** **** ****** **** *** ****** ****** ** ***** *** ** *** ***** ******",
