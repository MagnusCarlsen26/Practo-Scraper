"Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Knee replacement,",0,0,NO,"My mom got treatment from this Dr at Venkateshwara Hospital recently. When my mom went for initial checkup, this Dr PS Gill said, he will teat them.

But didn't informed he was on notice period with Hospital and post operation stopped responding to calls and said he will not open stitches at all and lied that he is out of India whereas truth was he was not with hospital anymore.**** **** *** ******** *** * ********* ***** *** ******** ******** *** *********** ** *** ******** **** **** * *****
I would not recommend PS gill to anyone, if he was going to leave treatment midway, he should have informed us. We have to do rounds of hospital, who after 3-4 days helped us and my mom's stitches got removed. But if caused unnecessary stress and tension.
