None,"ACL &PCL Reconstruction,Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"He is a marvellous doctor with highly precise skills when it comes to OT. but above all he bears great human characters who treats each patient with respect. He possesses great empathy for his patients . I had met an bike accident that caused very severe injury to my knee. For months i was helpless and without any improvement even after spending majority of my financial savings. I visited many named orthopedist and let my savings flow in their pocket with a hope that i will be able to walk again but everything went into vein. I had completely lost my faith to doctors .  I visited the honourable “Dr lalit lohia” having same mindset that i developed during past few months of my struggling among other doctors and thought i wont get any improvement in my health from him also (since i had lost my faith to doctors n was completely hopeless). But after my first consultation with him , he filled me with a new hope that i never thought would come to me. Ohh god , that man was so charmful that i still cant forget my first visit to him. I was filled with a new positiveness about my health when i left his office. He even didnt charge his consultation fee after hearing my story of suffering and stumbling from one doctor to another. I was not only able to walk but i was able to run with no discomfort at all and that too within  4weeks under his treatment. He is the man who restored my faith on doctors. I think apart from great knowledge and precise skills , that man throws huge vibe of positiveness towards his patients that half of your illness will be cured once you leave his office. When it comes to an orthopedist , i’ve never visited any other doctor since then. That man is truly an art of god. ",2023-03-13 20:16:04,False,True,Manish lohia,,,

None,None,0,0,NO,"I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with an orthopaedic doctor that I feel compelled to share. I visited Dr.Lalit for a consultation regarding a persistent ankle injury or my brother but unfortunately, my encounter with this doctor left me feeling frustrated, disrespected, and ultimately dissatisfied with the care I received.

***** *** ********* ** ***** ********* * ******** **** ** *************** *** ******* ****** ** ****** Instead of approaching my concerns with a compassionate and understanding demeanor, the doctor's behavior was remarkably rude and condescending. Not only did Dr. Lalit fail to listen attentively to my description of the issue, but they also scolded and belittled me, making me feel embarrassed and invalidated as a patient seeking help.

************ *** ******** ********** ****** ******* **** **** ****** ** ******** ****** ** ******* ******* *** *** ******* Despite bringing the MRI report with me, Dr. Lalit did not take the time ** ********** examine it, completely overlooking important details that were crucial to understanding the nature of my injury. As a result, the doctor provided me with inaccurate advice and treatment recommendations **** **** ********* ** ** ******** *********. This lack of attention to detail and disregard for important medical information is both alarming and unacceptable.

Adding to my disappointment, Dr. Lalit demonstrated a complete lack of punctuality. Despite scheduling my appointment well in advance, I was left waiting for an excessive amount of time in the waiting area. Not only is this unprofessional, but it also shows a blatant disregard for the value of my time as a patient. It is deeply frustrating to have to endure such lengthy delays, especially when dealing with a painful and debilitating injury.

Overall, my experience with Dr. Lalit was extremely negative. Their unprofessional behavior* ******* ** ******** ****** ** ******* ******* *** *** ******* and lack of punctuality are clear indicators of a lack of commitment to patient care. As someone seeking help and guidance for my orthopaedic issues, I expected to be treated with respect and receive accurate and timely medical attention. Unfortunately, Dr. Lalit fell far short of these expectations, leaving me feeling let down and discouraged.

I strongly urge others to reconsider visiting this orthopaedic doctor based on my personal experience. It is essential to find a healthcare professional who not only possesses the necessary expertise but also treats their patients with respect, empathy, and professionalism. ****** *** ***** ****** ** **** **** *** **** ***** ********* ** ******* ***** *** I would caution anyone in need of orthopaedic services to seek alternative options for their medical needs.",2023-06-25 04:47:26,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,Today I huv visited to Dr. Lalit for my daughter knee pain issue. He didn't diagnose the issue and recommended various tests. As I huv informed him that pain started during play at home with siblings* * **** ** *** *** ********* ********* If everything is dependent on Test & its result for such a small issue then what is the use of Doctor diagnosed. Definitely I am not a medical professional but I can understand the way of medication. I would like not to recommend him. Highly unsatisfied.,2023-10-14 10:38:11,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
