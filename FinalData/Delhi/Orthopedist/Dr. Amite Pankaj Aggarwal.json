She was made to stand within two hours of surgery and made to walk next day. Its five days hospitalisation. There were no external stitches and bandages were removed after two weeks. My wife was of her own after eight days of surgery. She left using walker/stick after four weeks and is recovering fast. It is painless surgery and also there is no pain afterwards if one follows doctor's instructions. Dr Amite has dedicated team of doctors, physiotherapists and coordinators. Dr Amite himself was only a call away during hospitalisation of my wife. I must add that Dr Amite follows strict timings, talks straight and leaves no room for confusion for patient or attendant. I sincerely thank Dr Amite Pankaj Agarwal and recommend to patients looking for total or partial knee replacement.\nJoginder Jyoti***********\n",

I  have  found a real angel in Dr. Amit. I have  never  come  across  such a caring and loving team of doctors in my life. Although I  have  tought  Dr. Amit  for  a short  period  now I  am  highly proud  that my  saplingling which I planted long  back are blossoming and serving the humanity.

She was made to stand within two hours of surgery and made to walk next day. Its five days hospitalisation. There were no external stitches and bandages were removed after two weeks. My wife was of her own after eight days of surgery. She left using walker/stick after four weeks and is recovering fast. It is painless surgery and also there is no pain afterwards if one follows doctor's instructions. Dr Amite has dedicated team of doctors, physiotherapists and coordinators. Dr Amite himself was only a call away during hospitalisation of my wife. I must add that Dr Amite follows strict timings, talks straight and leaves no room for confusion for patient or attendant. I sincerely thank Dr Amite Pankaj Agarwal and recommend to patients looking for total or partial knee replacement.\nJoginder Jyoti***********\n",

I  have  found a real angel in Dr. Amit. I have  never  come  across  such a caring and loving team of doctors in my life. Although I  have  tought  Dr. Amit  for  a short  period  now I  am  highly proud  that my  saplingling which I planted long  back are blossoming and serving the humanity. I wish that  they  grow  further and serve  the people. God bless you all. Thank Amit,Tarun and the  team.",
