"Value for money,Treatment satisfaction,","Joint and Muscle Problems,",0,0,NO,My mother is 82 years of age and once we visit doctor and explained everything about her health he immediately send her for x-ray not only one or 2 5 were conducted. I was not at all satisfied with the medicines he prescribed. On a very first go he charged 2200 which was not worth at all. ,2019-01-25 07:16:46,False,False,Verified Patient,You were not satisfied because of the care given or the fact that you had to pay 2200 rupees. This kind of review shows that you were pained to pay  to know the well being of your mother. We are not magicians or vaids who would tell the problem by just palpating the pulse of the patients,2019-01-25T12:45:34+0000,Dr. Anil Raheja
