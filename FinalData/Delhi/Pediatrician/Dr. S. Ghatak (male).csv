He is a very arrogant and dismissive doctor who treats empirically without understanding the symptoms.
I found him also very unfriendly towards children where in instead of comforting the child he seemed aloof and scary to an already sick child.
Also considering his poor diagnosis skill his expertise as a paediatrician is doubtful as per me.
