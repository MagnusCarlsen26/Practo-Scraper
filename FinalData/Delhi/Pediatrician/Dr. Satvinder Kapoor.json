Personally I'm very fond of her calm and composed approach and never lets you panic in the toughest situations. Her support has always been there at any hour and all kids in our family are under her care.\nA very warm, friendly, and positive person and always encourages children. She understands child psychology, behavioral patterns among kids very nicely and has always provided valuable guidance in dealing with such issues in kids. ",
