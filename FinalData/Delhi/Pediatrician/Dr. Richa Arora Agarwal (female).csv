None,None,0,0,YES,"My baby was getting these stomach cramps and gastric problems after mid night. Dr Richa was very understanding & polite person to deal with. She took the initiative of checking my baby from head to toe including her weight, size etc. 
Dr Richa was genuinely concerned about her patient and gave us some important tips which we were not aware of and m sure all parent are not aware as well and they should know. Besides she also gave enough time to us to answer all our questions. I recommend this doctor as one of the best doctor and person in the city. If you reside in Rohini or Pitampura or nearby area, one must visit her for consultation. Her clinic is not very flashy it's simple but the doctor Is super intelligent and highly qualifies & highly experienced.
Few flashy clinics with doctors we visited in the past, misguide us with baby care but Dr Richa put us on right track with baby care & treatments. She is gonna be our permanent pediatric from now on.
Thank You Doctor for your help & support today.",2016-09-27 17:37:04,False,True,Jyoti Johar Jethi,,,

None,"Cough In Children,",0,0,Yes,"Very good doctor. Listens patiently. Gets a good understanding of the issues faced by patient. Prescribed the ***** medicine. Did not go outrightly for diagnostic tests unnecessarily. Told that take medicine for 2 days, if still issue persists, then we will go for tests. Really liked that. Was also available on mobile as we had to clarify one thing. 

Most importantly, my kiddo is well now with her medicine.

Highly recommended.
