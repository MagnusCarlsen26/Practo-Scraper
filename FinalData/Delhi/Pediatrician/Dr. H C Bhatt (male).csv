"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"An individual's true character and personality is best revealed in a time of crisis. I think when it comes to doctors, this couldn't be more true! With Dr. H.C. Bhatt, and the gentle, caring, ************* and yet simple personality that he is, he has helped us tide over many a crisis over the last 1.5 years, every time our daughter (now 2-year old) faced a health issue. 

Most recently, our daughter was diagnosed with viral respiratory infection, and was very unwell for almost a week, with high fever, extreme cough and congestion. We were extremely anxious and worried. This is the time when parents are so very vulnerable that they'll take just about any advice from a doctor for the sake of their child. It is in these moments that a doctor's patience, kindness and sincere and honest advice matters the most. Dr. Bhatt has really helped us tide over this crisis with his good guidance, correct and accurate medication, and most importantly, never even once giving us any sign of anxiety. We saw the result in less than a few days - our daughter is recovering and much better now! 

Thank you so much Dr. Bhatt for the wonderful doctor and the wonderful human being that you are, and for everything you've done for us! God Bless!
