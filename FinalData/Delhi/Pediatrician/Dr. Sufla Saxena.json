She has recently diagnosed my son's digestion related issues and suggested a healthy and much needed change in his diet plan and lifestyle (exercise and sleep) . We as parents at times know what is wrong with our children but we do not work at it unless we hear it from a wise person. Speaking to Dr. Saxena gave us that realization how we should handle this situation. Even our son who never took his diet and activities seriously understood its importance after listening to doctor he has also reduced his screen time and is involved more in physical activity and eating what is good for him( in right amount, at right time). Now he even sleeps on time. :-) A big thank you to Dr. Sufla Saxena.",

We came to India from US in September 2020 for a short trip and we met Dr. Sufla Saxena for our daughter Advika's rashes and itching. My daughter was  2.5 years old with 8.6 kgs of weight. Doctors in US initially declared that she has food allergy and put her on a gluten free, dairy free and nuts free diet. After one year when we asked for her allergy test then allergy was not at all detected and then doctors starting calling it food sensitivity.\nWhen we consulted Dr. Sufla Saxena, she did her through investigation and made a plan to start some supplement along with regular food, her startegy worked so well that my daughter is now on regular diet without any additional vitamins or tonic and gaining weight.\nI would say that it is all because of Dr. Sufla Saxena who gave us proper guidance and confidence that my daughter is now doing great. \nThank you Dr. Sufla Saxena ! \n",

Mam listened to us very patiently and advised good medicines for gastrointestinal issues basis her diagnosis for Kaavya. She also spoke to my daughter that comforted her. Gradually after more than 20 days of treatment, this is still in progress, we can see lot of positive difference in my daughter's wellbeing and her Abdominal pains have also reduced to large extent. The good part is that Mam is very easily approachable and kids feel homely after meeting her.This was my daughter's feedback after we physically met the doctor on one of our visits to Manipal Hospital. I would strongly recommend her treatment in case of children.thank you so much.Gaurav Kankaria",

                "review_text": "I would say that we are so fortunate that we met Dr. Sufla Saxena. We came to India from US in September 2020 for a short trip and we met Dr. Sufla Saxena for our daughter Advika's rashes and itching. My daughter was  2.5 years old with 8.6 kgs of weight. Doctors in US initially declared that she has food allergy and put her on a gluten free, dairy free and nuts free diet. After one year when we asked for her allergy test then allergy was not at all detected and then doctors starting calling it food sensitivity.\nWhen we consulted Dr. Sufla Saxena, she did her through investigation and made a plan to start some supplement along with regular food, her startegy worked so well that my daughter is now on regular diet without any additional vitamins or tonic and gaining weight.\nI would say that it is all because of Dr. Sufla Saxena who gave us proper guidance and confidence that my daughter is now doing great. \nThank you Dr. Sufla Saxena ! \n",

Gradually after more than 20 days of treatment, this is still in progress, we can see lot of positive difference in my daughter's wellbeing and her Abdominal pains have also reduced to large extent. The good part is that Mam is very easily approachable and kids feel homely after meeting her.This was my daughter's feedback after we physically met the doctor on one of our visits to Manipal Hospital. I would strongly recommend her treatment in case of children.thank you so much.Gaurav Kankaria",
