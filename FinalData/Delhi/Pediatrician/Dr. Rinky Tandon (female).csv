None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Rinky Tandon is a very thorough doctor. She does assessment of the children herself and that first step makes all the difference.  Compared to other doctors, she came to exactly the same conclusion regarding our child as we had come to. She also had a very dedicated team to do various therapies.  The clinic also has a nice ambience. Together they have improved by childs developmental issues greatly. We value the support we have got from them. ",2024-06-27 07:08:05,False,True,Arpita,,,
