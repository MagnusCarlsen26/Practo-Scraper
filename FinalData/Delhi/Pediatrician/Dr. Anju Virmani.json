Because we knew that she is rude but this is not mere chiding anymore, it has now turned traumatic.  Incident 1- my niece is hospitalised and we make an SOS call to her in the afternoon \u2018please don\u2019t call me now, I am busy with a friend\u2019. Incident 2 - take an appointment after a gap of 6 months because the parents and the daughter kept delaying because they are too scared to face that ******* * *** ****** ************ ******* * *** *** *** **** ******** ******* *** ***** **** *** ** **** **** ** ********** **** **** ***** No medical prognosis provided\u2019 and appointment over ( ************** * * **** ******** ****** **** ******** ** *** ****** a whatsapp message received next day \u2018 please take appointment for another day for consultation\u2019 ** ******* *** ** **** ** **** * *** *** **** **** *** ******* *** * ************ **** **** ******* Basically, the first consultation was wasted in ONLY shouting. We she would shout( initially we took it as concern) and then give some prognosis which didn\u2019t happen this time. No medical examination after paying consultation fee! The fee wasn\u2019t returned either. \n**** ** ***** ** **** *** **** *** ******* *** ****** **** **** ******* * ****** *** *** ******** ******* ***** ********** Please DO NOT consult her, a doctor is someone who deserves respect but this is torturous for the child!!
