If you visited doctor at morning time, next by the evening if you have any small/big concern about your child to query to doctor they will charged money Rs 500 for that. but when you surprise of this fees structure, receptionist will allow you to go to the doctor chamber rather to give any clarifications. 

Any way your meeting started with doctor, but surprisingly doctor will behave awkwardly with you, his patience and behavior both are unpractical and unprofessional.     

Unfortunately all these happen with me.",2022-09-12 08:28:35,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
