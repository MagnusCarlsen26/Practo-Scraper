None,None,0,0,YES,I went to Dr Sufla Saxena for treatment of my son Anirudh 6 yrs aged having complain of stomach pain for last one month.  Before going to her I visited three pediatric Doctors but no fruitful results.  With some test and medicines she started treatment and I found speedy recovery of my son within week. Now my son is perfectly okay. The way she treated my son in not only admirable but also shows her professionalism. I strongly recommend everyone whose children are suffering from any gastro related problem.  I also want to say thanks to Doctor. ,2021-08-27 18:09:33,False,True,Ashwini,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"I would say that we are so fortunate that we met Dr. Sufla Saxena. We came to India from US in September 2020 for a short trip and we met Dr. Sufla Saxena for our daughter Advika's rashes and itching. My daughter was  2.5 years old with 8.6 kgs of weight. Doctors in US initially declared that she has food allergy and put her on a gluten free, dairy free and nuts free diet. After one year when we asked for her allergy test then allergy was not at all detected and then doctors starting calling it food sensitivity.
When we consulted Dr. Sufla Saxena, she did her through investigation and made a plan to start some supplement along with regular food, her startegy worked so well that my daughter is now on regular diet without any additional vitamins or tonic and gaining weight.
I would say that it is all because of Dr. Sufla Saxena who gave us proper guidance and confidence that my daughter is now doing great. 
Thank you Dr. Sufla Saxena !
