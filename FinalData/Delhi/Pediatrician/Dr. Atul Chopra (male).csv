None,None,0,0,YES," First of all, I apologize for that I can't explain enough how Dr. Atul is good enough for us as  I'm not a native English speaker.
 We are an expat family and were very new in delhi in 2013. I came to know Dr. Atul Chopra through my neighbour's strong recommendations. I needed to know good pediatricians for a general check up and vaccinations. When I met him for vaccination for the first time, He explained well regarding  expected results, reactions and medications with smiling n kindness. These actions may be very usuall jobs as a doctor. But as a foreigner who doesn't know how to speak English fluently, it was very thankful something. 
Additionally.. one experience I was touched is.. That time was just after few months we had settled down in delhi. My son was sick and had a high fever. There were not my family and any friends to ask help and rely on.  At the moment I had two pediatricians' s  phone numbers. So I sent messages them about my son's symptoms. It was about at 10 or 11pm. But only Dr. Atul sent me messeges and got back to me what and how to do. He was the only one who could help us. I don't know if this is common in India or Indian doctors are like this. (it's unusual in my country.) He tried to support my family who doesn't have reliable helps through difficult times alike as much as he can as a doctor. This is an unforgettable experience for ever. After this happening, my family became a big fan of him. Now when people (who seeks for pediatricians for their child) ask me, i recommend him without any hesitating. 
I have two kids. My kids also like Dr. Atul. He doesn't need to try to relieve my kids's fear of this white gown person or his stethoscope. My kids know how friendly he is. His home clinic which is in gk2 is warm n kids friendly place. He keeps some toys and lets kids play to feel comfortable and ease their fear. His clinic became my kids's play ground(Sorry, dr. Atul). He takes care of kids but also parents s mind by relieving their anxiety. Dr. Atul is more than good enough for my kids n family. I think there are not proper words I can't thank him enough.
