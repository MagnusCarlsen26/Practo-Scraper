None,None,0,0,Yes,"I have started visiting Dr. Vikas Taneja from the last two months and I have attained a great satisfaction in the treatment. The waiting time is also not so bothering. Usually, within 10 or 15 minutes, I have got my consultation. I can only give one suggestion to them. The registration process needs to speed up because only one person is handling the registration process and the queue consumes lot of time for the same. Other than that I have experienced good hospitality ever since I started visiting here.",2020-01-04 11:21:41,False,True,Neeti chellani,,,
None,None,0,0,YES, I visited Manipal hospital on 12dec 2019.  My child was having severe cold. I fix an appointment with dr. Vikas Taneja who is a child specialist over there. First thing which was very disturbing was the waiting time that is more than 1 hour. Even after taking appointment well in advance we have have to wait for one hour. Then the reception staff told us that the dr. Is busy in icu and will be back in 15 minutes. My baby and my husband both were not well and when the dr. Returned from icu a staff member from the same hospital entered the dr. Room without any appointment with other patient for check up and wasted 15 minutes over there. When we asked the reception staff he misguided us that the person is  going to show just a report to dr. And will be back soon. But ultimately we come to know that the reception staff was partial towards there staff person and  even they ask for a apology at end for the inconvenience. No doubt dr. Taneja is really good he explained everything very clearly. And tell us the root problem to deal with. Really happy and satisfied with his work. But I am very disappointed with the staff behaviour and I am filling written complaint against them in the concerned department.,2019-12-13 19:12:00,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"DR VIKASH TANEJA is very freindly, competent and is very good in his diagnosis. But the hospital reception is very bad and poor administration. No parking for patient. The hospital parking are meant only for staff and VIP. So I will probably stop visiting the hospital and not even recommend anyone to your hospital.
