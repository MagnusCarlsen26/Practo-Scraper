,,0,0,YES,Dr. Vinay told me each and everything in very crystal clear words about the vaccination of my baby. He told me about the options available and then I had to decide which option to go with. I have heard that vaccination is very tough for newborns but the way Dr. vinay handled my babies vaccination schedule is just amazing. I would recommend each and everyone to go with Dr. vinay  for vaccination of newborn as he is best in the field.,2023-12-28 13:01:04,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
