None,"Colic,",0,0,NO,"Doc is fine but there is no way of getting in touch in case of emergencies. 

Especially for a new born one needs to have extra guidance and care.  We had our baby at Fortis (which was a bad experience overall). 

We did our first visits to dr raghuram  but when we needed to contact during some colic issue we were not put fwd to him and had to go through a junior doctor. 

He might be good at what he does but needs to be available for patients in some form or the other.  I have heard of other doctors being available on call or what's app to guide or attend to issues. ",2016-12-10 01:55:12,False,False,Manmeet Nanda,,,
