,,0,0,NO,"It was a horrible, traumatic experience !
My niece who is just 17 years was diagnosed with T1D  when she was just 9 Years old, so this is a girl who stays in a small town and has been consulting her for a while. 
Each appointment with Dr begins with blaming parents and shouting at the parents in front of the child (with no consideration of the trauma) but being from a small town we kept consulting her and being patient and polite. Because we knew that she is rude but this is not mere chiding anymore, it has now turned traumatic.  Incident 1- my niece is hospitalised and we make an SOS call to her in the afternoon ‘please don’t call me now, I am busy with a friend’. Incident 2 - take an appointment after a gap of 6 months because the parents and the daughter kept delaying because they are too scared to face that ******* * *** ****** ************ ******* * *** *** *** **** ******** ******* *** ***** **** *** ** **** **** ** ********** **** **** ***** No medical prognosis provided’ and appointment over ( ************** * * **** ******** ****** **** ******** ** *** ****** a whatsapp message received next day ‘ please take appointment for another day for consultation’ ** ******* *** ** **** ** **** * *** *** **** **** *** ******* *** * ************ **** **** ******* Basically, the first consultation was wasted in ONLY shouting. We she would shout( initially we took it as concern) and then give some prognosis which didn’t happen this time. No medical examination after paying consultation fee! The fee wasn’t returned either.
