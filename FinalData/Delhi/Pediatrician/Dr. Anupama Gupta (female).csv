None,"Childhood Infections,",0,0,YES,"Dr Gupta is just the perfect kind of pediatrician that a mother needs. Her diagnosis is on the spot, her clinic is very child friendly and she has a way with children that instils confidence in a me everytime I visit her.
She taught me how to give medicine to my child who hates taking even the sweetest cough syrup when she is unwell. She helped me find tactical ways to feed my fussy child. 
As a mother of a sick child she was always available on phone during the sickness.
She is a great doctor & I highly recommend her.
