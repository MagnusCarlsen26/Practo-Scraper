"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Sarita was probably the first one to point out and suggest a systematic treatment of my 20-year-old allergy problem. She was patient with the tests and ensured I was not put on ad-hoc medication without proper diagnosis. Her line of treatment is scientific and patient-friendly. Really happy to report that after suffering for over 20 years with allergies, having done everything under the sun to fight it, I have finally found a way to control it without having to cope with severe side effects of heavy steroids. Highly recommend her for allergies - diagnosis and treatment. Also, both my kids (7 years and 6 months) love her. She is an amazing pediatrician. ",2019-12-20 14:55:24,False,True,Ashim Ghosh,,,
