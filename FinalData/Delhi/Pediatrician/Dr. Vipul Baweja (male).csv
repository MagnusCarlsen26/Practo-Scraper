None,None,0,0,YES,"My son had dengu like fever with warning sign and  somebody recommend me to see Dr. Vipul. Doctor listened to us patiently and checked existing test reports. He performed detailed physical examination of my son and then he explained  in detail about my son health condition and potential treatment plan. He advised all the required test and made sure that treatment is started on time and test reports are available quickly for further direction of treatment. I have came across very few such honest, friendly and down to earth doctor in my life. He shown concern about my expenses and instead of delaying treatment as some doctors do,  he advised if your son has started taking food and feeling better now  then I will advise discharge and you can go home and he can recover further at home. He is a great doctor with great professional skills and a nice human being. God bless him!!",2021-11-14 13:52:06,False,True,Tanzilur Rahman Khan,,,

I never met such an excellent Dr. in my life. Thank you, Dr., for your support.
