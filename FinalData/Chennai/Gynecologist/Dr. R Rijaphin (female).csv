None,"Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Child Birth Education,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Gynae Problems,Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"No words can describe how  grateful I felt during my pregnancy and labour and my sincere Thanks to Dr.Rijaphin for made me feel like such,  I am sure I feel blessed during and after delivery is only because of you, and I could not ask for more!

It’s my first pregnancy and on scan we have observed Polyhydramnios is where there is too much amniotic fluid around the baby, due to which the baby head is not engaged in to pelvis even after 39 weeks, There comes my guardian angel Dr. Rijaphin, OMG! what a beautiful soul inside and out, Though I am from a medical background, I have never met such a gyno with this level of patience and real care from the bottom of the heart since day one we met! I am already in love with her.

I was very anxious about my labour as like everyone, but, I wanted to have a normal delivery at any point due to some personal concerns, she understood and supported me personally and professionally beyond any other doctor would go for their patient’s.

Even during the active labour where everyone lost our hope for normal delivery and even my own family started convincing me for C section, where the only person Dr.Rijaphin tried all the way possible and went above and beyond (where she doesn’t have to and simply could have insist me to go for C section as the baby head is not engaged and I was dilated only 4 cm). 

Not just during our ante natal visit and labour, she is one sweet heart where she used to follow up even after that and guide me on every single detail. 

For anyone who doesn’t have any idea about pregnancy and labour, I swear, Ladies, you can blindly go to her and she would definitely make u feel the same way!

I am super grateful and blessed for get to know her through this phase and I wish all the love and happiness to this amazing women all her life
