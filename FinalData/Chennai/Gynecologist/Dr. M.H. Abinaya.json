                "review_text": "     As an expecting mother, I was adamant in my view that the body can heal itself without any kind of medical intervention. I was stubborn that my pregnancy should be of the same path. I am a sportsperson since my childhood and active even now. I had heard experiences of mothers where, even during normal birthing, they had taken supplements during their pregnancy and used medical interventions during child birth. That's when I realised that there were not just 2 types of birthing (Normal and C-Section) but a third, NATURAL Birthing. So with this perspective, I was searching for a Doctor who would understand my views w.r.t. medicine. I was anxious, as many Doctors in today's world lean toward prescribing high medicine dosage. I went through various doctor reviews when I came across Dr. Abinaya who stood out as the perfect fit. The first time I went for a consultation I had explained to her what was on my mind, to which she was cautious, but supportive, given my history of exercise regimen and natural vegetarian diet. She said she will support and co-operate as long as I continue to take care of my diet and exercise. Dr. Abinaya was informative, she understood and appreciated this view and didn't prescribe or compell to take any medicine. She guided me with a natural diet, exercise and suggested HypnoBirthing sessions with Padma Ganapati. This co-operation was seen throughout the pregnancy. Dr. Abinaya had conducted a nutrition and yoga session for expecting mothers. \n     Even during the critical time of COVID19, she was available for consultation through calls or WhatsApp and was immediately responsive to any queries I had. On the big day, Dr. Abinaya immediately responded and co-ordinated with the Hospital to admit and take care. She had even instructed the Hospital to act according to my birth preferences which I had provided to her previously. My mother was with me as my BIRTH PARTNER, for the entire duration of birthing. Dr. Abinaya and the Hospital staff avoided IV, medication or any other medical intervention and took the entire process during labour in a smooth and composed manner toward a natural birth. All the nurses in the Hospital cooperated with Dr. Abinaya and us. This was an amazing experience for me. If any expecting mother needs more information on my experience so that they will feel more confident to go along this path, please feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, I will be more happy to vouch for Dr.Abinaya.\nOur special thanks and salute to Dr.Abinaya of Sai Ram Fertility & Maternity Clinic, T.Nagar, Chennai.  \n",

I was worried, as many doctors in Chennai lean toward prescribing medicine/injections for my situation, but I was adamant that everything should be done naturally. My husband went through various doctor reviews in Practo and Google. He came across Dr. Abinaya, going by her patient story. She checked me in January and told me a sac was seen, nothing to worry about, just an injection would do to stop the bleeding, but I said I would like the process to be natural. She agreed and asked me to take rest for a few days and to take an early pregnancy scan. She also warned me that if the bleeding doesn't stop, the one solution is injection. But thank God, by a few days, the bleeding stopped and everything was OK. i went on regular check ups and she asked me to join a class after 3 months, which was necessary for me cos i was opting for a natural birth and the fee was very nominal...i had lot of small doubts on the process which mam would clear on whatsapp and if its major she would ask me to come...on the big day after 37 weeks i got the pain at midnight i went to the hospital and the duty doctors were informing Dr. Abinaya. She came around 4.30 am and I delivered a girl baby vaginally and naturally. I asked her about the episiotomy process and she told me that it would tear somewhere so it was better to do this so i agreed for that. I was there in the hospital for 3 days and mam was following up on the situation..If any expectant mother needs more clarity on my experience, feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, Just trust her blindly and she'll guide you on the right path..\n\nMy special thanks to Dr.Abinaya and team of Sai Ram Fertility & Maternity Clinic, T.Nagar, Chennai and R&R hospital team T.Nagar.\n",

I didn't take any supplements during the pregnancy and didnt have any kind of medical intervention during the birth. For anyone, if the first time we do something and we feel it was a success the mind gains confidence to follow the same process without a fraction of doubt or hesitation. The same way, my journey with NATURAL pregnancy and birth made me content and confident not only with my mind and body to follow the same path for my second pregnancy, it also gave me immense confidence in Dr. Abinaya to be by my side every step of the way. As known and expected, she did the same. She also had that glow of confidence and excitement to go through the same path when I went for my consultation with her for my second pregnancy. She was always available through call or WhatsApp and immediately responsive to any queries. We came across few obstacles at the hospital with their management for which Dr. Abinaya helped remarkably. She took the entire process during labour in a smooth and composed manner toward a natural birth, and supported my decisions with pure confidence.

I\u2019m a Srilankan and I would Highly recommend Dr Abinaya for her utmost caring, follow-ups and professionalism in treating International patients. I met Dr Abinaya through one of my Indian friend as I have been married for 9 years and was not pregnant until I Met Dr Abinaya.\n\n You guys can imagine the hurdles, troubles I would have gone through when everyone asks \u201cDo you have kids\u201d.  I went to almost all hospitals in Srilanka, met many gynecologists, spent lakhs and lakhs of money in Srilanka, did 3 cycles of IUI and tried almost all medicines prescribed by Srilankan doctors but nothing worked out.\n\nI flew to India as advised by my Indian friend and stayed in India for 5 days to continue my treatment. She does not take chances or treat patients based on assumptions. At the same time, she does not burden us with unwanted tests. Doctor Abinaya advised us only for important tests and finally the report revealed that I have \u201cPCOS\u201d and nobody in srilanka told us about it and was generally sent for \u201cIUI\u201d treatment. Doctor Abhinaya gave me medicine\u2019s and advised to follow it up for 3 months, I did what doctor said and I\u2019m very much happy to say that I\u2019m 3 months pregnant now. \n\nI visited India only 2 times to her clinic and Doctor Abinaya did what Srilankan Doctors can\u2019t do. First time I have seen such a dedicated doctor who cares for the patients, explains clearly on what she is going to do, what I need to do, what\u2019s the next plan etc, which ideally helps international patients like me to understand it easily. Doctor Abinaya has removed all my tears & problems which is a disguise in a bliss. \n\nI can\u2019t thank you enough and thank you is a small word for the things you have done to us. we need doctors like you in Srilanka as there are so many women\u2019s who are anticipating for a baby in srilanka and I\u2019m definitely going to refer you to them. Having struggled with infertility for so long, we fully understand the emotional, physical and mental stress and trauma this causes and would certainly recommend Dr Abinaya for the couples who are trying to conceive. Thank you once again Doctor.\n",

She is truly an exceptional doctor, and I can\u2019t praise her enough.  In short, we had a great experience with Dr. Abinaya and her clinic have set the bar very high in patient care and the treatment of PCOS. She was the first doctor I met with who took the time to put all the pieces together and explain the complicated dynamics of PCOS. From the very first appointment I knew that Dr. Abinaya was invested in my health and wellbeing. At each appointment she always takes the time to explain each step of the treatment process, answer questions, and educate me on PCOS.  I walk away from each appointment knowing I have all the information I need to make the next best choice in my health care. Each step of the way Dr. Abinaya had displayed genuine care and passion for helping women with PCOS. For the past 5 months that I was under her care, I was struck by her personal, individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering my questions, often anticipating them. I was further impressed with her incredible professional responsiveness in terms of communication. She responded to watsapp and phone calls within the same day and always contacted me personally after lab results came in. These qualities alone would have set her apart from other gynecologist.\nWe have been here several times and never been disappointed. The doctor is super friendly & you\u2019re able to schedule an appointment online. Each time, I\u2019ve received excellent, professional care delivered with kindness. I always feel like I get plenty of time to explain my issues without feeling rushed. I've managed to get in to be seen within a timely manner & even without an appointment. Dr. Abinaya took such wonderful care of me, explaining things carefully to make certain I understood it clearly.",

I have been consulting Dr. Abinaya from 2nd month of my pregnancy and when I was in a very weak condition. Slowly I coped up with my health, thanks to doctor\u2019s advice. She is the most friendliest doctor I have come across. She spends a lot of time with us and explain us every single information in a very detailed manner. She is very calm and composed and I\u2019m able to connect with her very easily which is the most important thing between a doctor and a patient. I was not thrusted with lots and lots of tablets but I was advised healthy food due to which I gained lot of energy and stamina. When I\u2019m back home after consultation, I get the feeling that every single doubt I had in my mind is addressed. \nDoctor is available 24/7 to pick up calls and answer queries and even addresses the smallest doubt patiently. As a working woman, I have time only on weekends hence I always get my appointment fixed according to my comfortable timing. she is very flexible to accommodate her schedule and also takes up last minute changes/appointments which is really helpful and commendable. Dr. Abinaya has been a great support and shall recommend her with all my heart and confidence.",

Abinaya  who is always with smiling face  in 2014 around 3 years back for my prolapsed uterus  as advised by one of my close friend.. She was very patient, pleasing and supportive whenever I went to see her. In June2017 I approached her since I could feel discomfort with the prolapse. She examined and said now it\u2019s time to go for removal to avoid future complications. On September 25th I was operated upon for a virginal hysterectomy and Dr. Abinay was so supportive and gave me much courage to me and my husband.   on Wednesday morning  I could walk myself and take bath myself, when dr came to examine me I was walking in the hospital corridor. Seeing me with smile Dr said pack up . I was so happy and thankful to the doctor for infusing so much confidence in me and explained to me and my husband who was a little worried much patiently. Today I went for  my post-operative review  I was walking slowly though I could walk normally seeing me Dr said usha you are not a patient walk normally I started walking normally and came out  with much more confidence. I really want to thank Dr. Abinay one for her helpful approach, patience and concern she shows to her patients. I very much recommend her for any gynaecological issues. One more thing I want to mention about Doctor is that she is equally concerned about the expenses to be borne by her patience. I once again thank you Dr. Abinaya.   ",

Due to her age, my mother and I were both very perturbed and upset. However, the Doctor reassured us that treatment was possible and importantly my mother seemed convinced about the same.\n\nOver the next week, my mother underwent a slew of tests, the Doctor diagnosed that there was a cancerous growth and described in detail , the treatment plan of removing the Uterus (Hysterectomy).\n\nAfter consultation with the rest of the family which includes my five sisters, my mother successfully underwent the surgical procedure and today she is up and about.\n\nWe recommend Dr.Abinaya and our family will always be grateful to her.",

Atlast time came at 38 week I delivered a girl baby due to my health issue  and infections we tried normal delivery till last but  we cant further proceed due to infections so atlast LSCS is done and now baby is fine and healthy now .the 2 doctors who said our baby is underdeveloped at 27 weeks it's because of DR.M.H.Abinaya baskaran who took it as challenge  and  made this one finally happen. I respect her from my heart and there are some doctors who are really compared to supernatural powers that's why this doctor profession is still respected everywhere and she is the only one. We can get in touch over phone at any time . When I was suffering from pain at 2 am, at that time also she picked my call within 2 rings really amazing.\n ",

Dr. Abinaya explains every aspect of the medical condition and treatment procedure with utmost clarity and patience. \nAs a pregnant patient, I had an overload of paranoia due to a previous miscarriage coupled with the raging hormones of the current pregnancy. Though Dr. Abinaya noticed my heightened anxiety during those initial weeks of pregnancy, not once did she make me feel bad for having those natural emotions. Rather, she reassured me with her positive and approachable nature and scanned me a few extra times for my sense of peace until my confidence rose. What a magnanimous doctor! Not only is she so professional in her medical expertise but so humane and caring of the emotions and seemingly irrational fears of a pregnant woman. \n\n\n\n",

                "review_text": "     As an expecting mother, I was adamant in my view that the body can heal itself without any kind of medical intervention. I was stubborn that my pregnancy should be of the same path. I am a sportsperson since my childhood and active even now. I had heard experiences of mothers where, even during normal birthing, they had taken supplements during their pregnancy and used medical interventions during child birth. That's when I realised that there were not just 2 types of birthing (Normal and C-Section) but a third, NATURAL Birthing. So with this perspective, I was searching for a Doctor who would understand my views w.r.t. medicine. I was anxious, as many Doctors in today's world lean toward prescribing high medicine dosage. I went through various doctor reviews when I came across Dr. Abinaya who stood out as the perfect fit. The first time I went for a consultation I had explained to her what was on my mind, to which she was cautious, but supportive, given my history of exercise regimen and natural vegetarian diet. She said she will support and co-operate as long as I continue to take care of my diet and exercise. Dr. Abinaya was informative, she understood and appreciated this view and didn't prescribe or compell to take any medicine. She guided me with a natural diet, exercise and suggested HypnoBirthing sessions with Padma Ganapati. This co-operation was seen throughout the pregnancy. Dr. Abinaya had conducted a nutrition and yoga session for expecting mothers. \n     Even during the critical time of COVID19, she was available for consultation through calls or WhatsApp and was immediately responsive to any queries I had. On the big day, Dr. Abinaya immediately responded and co-ordinated with the Hospital to admit and take care. She had even instructed the Hospital to act according to my birth preferences which I had provided to her previously. My mother was with me as my BIRTH PARTNER, for the entire duration of birthing. Dr. Abinaya and the Hospital staff avoided IV, medication or any other medical intervention and took the entire process during labour in a smooth and composed manner toward a natural birth. All the nurses in the Hospital cooperated with Dr. Abinaya and us. This was an amazing experience for me. If any expecting mother needs more information on my experience so that they will feel more confident to go along this path, please feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, I will be more happy to vouch for Dr.Abinaya.\nOur special thanks and salute to Dr.Abinaya of Sai Ram Fertility & Maternity Clinic, T.Nagar, Chennai.  \n",

I was worried, as many doctors in Chennai lean toward prescribing medicine/injections for my situation, but I was adamant that everything should be done naturally. My husband went through various doctor reviews in Practo and Google. He came across Dr. Abinaya, going by her patient story. She checked me in January and told me a sac was seen, nothing to worry about, just an injection would do to stop the bleeding, but I said I would like the process to be natural. She agreed and asked me to take rest for a few days and to take an early pregnancy scan. She also warned me that if the bleeding doesn't stop, the one solution is injection. But thank God, by a few days, the bleeding stopped and everything was OK. i went on regular check ups and she asked me to join a class after 3 months, which was necessary for me cos i was opting for a natural birth and the fee was very nominal...i had lot of small doubts on the process which mam would clear on whatsapp and if its major she would ask me to come...on the big day after 37 weeks i got the pain at midnight i went to the hospital and the duty doctors were informing Dr. Abinaya. She came around 4.30 am and I delivered a girl baby vaginally and naturally. I asked her about the episiotomy process and she told me that it would tear somewhere so it was better to do this so i agreed for that. I was there in the hospital for 3 days and mam was following up on the situation..If any expectant mother needs more clarity on my experience, feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, Just trust her blindly and she'll guide you on the right path..\n\nMy special thanks to Dr.Abinaya and team of Sai Ram Fertility & Maternity Clinic, T.Nagar, Chennai and R&R hospital team T.Nagar.\n",

The same way, my journey with NATURAL pregnancy and birth made me content and confident not only with my mind and body to follow the same path for my second pregnancy, it also gave me immense confidence in Dr. Abinaya to be by my side every step of the way. As known and expected, she did the same. She also had that glow of confidence and excitement to go through the same path when I went for my consultation with her for my second pregnancy. She was always available through call or WhatsApp and immediately responsive to any queries. We came across few obstacles at the hospital with their management for which Dr. Abinaya helped remarkably. She took the entire process during labour in a smooth and composed manner toward a natural birth, and supported my decisions with pure confidence.

I\u2019m a Srilankan and I would Highly recommend Dr Abinaya for her utmost caring, follow-ups and professionalism in treating International patients. I met Dr Abinaya through one of my Indian friend as I have been married for 9 years and was not pregnant until I Met Dr Abinaya.\n\n You guys can imagine the hurdles, troubles I would have gone through when everyone asks \u201cDo you have kids\u201d.  I went to almost all hospitals in Srilanka, met many gynecologists, spent lakhs and lakhs of money in Srilanka, did 3 cycles of IUI and tried almost all medicines prescribed by Srilankan doctors but nothing worked out.\n\nI flew to India as advised by my Indian friend and stayed in India for 5 days to continue my treatment. She does not take chances or treat patients based on assumptions. At the same time, she does not burden us with unwanted tests. Doctor Abinaya advised us only for important tests and finally the report revealed that I have \u201cPCOS\u201d and nobody in srilanka told us about it and was generally sent for \u201cIUI\u201d treatment. Doctor Abhinaya gave me medicine\u2019s and advised to follow it up for 3 months, I did what doctor said and I\u2019m very much happy to say that I\u2019m 3 months pregnant now. \n\nI visited India only 2 times to her clinic and Doctor Abinaya did what Srilankan Doctors can\u2019t do. First time I have seen such a dedicated doctor who cares for the patients, explains clearly on what she is going to do, what I need to do, what\u2019s the next plan etc, which ideally helps international patients like me to understand it easily. Doctor Abinaya has removed all my tears & problems which is a disguise in a bliss. \n\nI can\u2019t thank you enough and thank you is a small word for the things you have done to us. we need doctors like you in Srilanka as there are so many women\u2019s who are anticipating for a baby in srilanka and I\u2019m definitely going to refer you to them. Having struggled with infertility for so long, we fully understand the emotional, physical and mental stress and trauma this causes and would certainly recommend Dr Abinaya for the couples who are trying to conceive. Thank you once again Doctor.\n",

She is truly an exceptional doctor, and I can\u2019t praise her enough.  In short, we had a great experience with Dr. Abinaya and her clinic have set the bar very high in patient care and the treatment of PCOS. She was the first doctor I met with who took the time to put all the pieces together and explain the complicated dynamics of PCOS. From the very first appointment I knew that Dr. Abinaya was invested in my health and wellbeing. At each appointment she always takes the time to explain each step of the treatment process, answer questions, and educate me on PCOS.  I walk away from each appointment knowing I have all the information I need to make the next best choice in my health care. Each step of the way Dr. Abinaya had displayed genuine care and passion for helping women with PCOS. For the past 5 months that I was under her care, I was struck by her personal, individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering my questions, often anticipating them. I was further impressed with her incredible professional responsiveness in terms of communication. She responded to watsapp and phone calls within the same day and always contacted me personally after lab results came in. These qualities alone would have set her apart from other gynecologist.\nWe have been here several times and never been disappointed. The doctor is super friendly & you\u2019re able to schedule an appointment online. Each time, I\u2019ve received excellent, professional care delivered with kindness. I always feel like I get plenty of time to explain my issues without feeling rushed. I've managed to get in to be seen within a timely manner & even without an appointment. Dr. Abinaya took such wonderful care of me, explaining things carefully to make certain I understood it clearly.",

I have been consulting Dr. Abinaya from 2nd month of my pregnancy and when I was in a very weak condition. Slowly I coped up with my health, thanks to doctor\u2019s advice. She is the most friendliest doctor I have come across. She spends a lot of time with us and explain us every single information in a very detailed manner. She is very calm and composed and I\u2019m able to connect with her very easily which is the most important thing between a doctor and a patient. I was not thrusted with lots and lots of tablets but I was advised healthy food due to which I gained lot of energy and stamina. When I\u2019m back home after consultation, I get the feeling that every single doubt I had in my mind is addressed. \nDoctor is available 24/7 to pick up calls and answer queries and even addresses the smallest doubt patiently. As a working woman, I have time only on weekends hence I always get my appointment fixed according to my comfortable timing. she is very flexible to accommodate her schedule and also takes up last minute changes/appointments which is really helpful and commendable. Dr. Abinaya has been a great support and shall recommend her with all my heart and confidence.",

Abinaya  who is always with smiling face  in 2014 around 3 years back for my prolapsed uterus  as advised by one of my close friend.. She was very patient, pleasing and supportive whenever I went to see her. In June2017 I approached her since I could feel discomfort with the prolapse. She examined and said now it\u2019s time to go for removal to avoid future complications. On September 25th I was operated upon for a virginal hysterectomy and Dr. Abinay was so supportive and gave me much courage to me and my husband.   on Wednesday morning  I could walk myself and take bath myself, when dr came to examine me I was walking in the hospital corridor. Seeing me with smile Dr said pack up . I was so happy and thankful to the doctor for infusing so much confidence in me and explained to me and my husband who was a little worried much patiently. Today I went for  my post-operative review  I was walking slowly though I could walk normally seeing me Dr said usha you are not a patient walk normally I started walking normally and came out  with much more confidence. I really want to thank Dr. Abinay one for her helpful approach, patience and concern she shows to her patients. I very much recommend her for any gynaecological issues. One more thing I want to mention about Doctor is that she is equally concerned about the expenses to be borne by her patience. I once again thank you Dr. Abinaya.   ",

Due to her age, my mother and I were both very perturbed and upset. However, the Doctor reassured us that treatment was possible and importantly my mother seemed convinced about the same.\n\nOver the next week, my mother underwent a slew of tests, the Doctor diagnosed that there was a cancerous growth and described in detail , the treatment plan of removing the Uterus (Hysterectomy).\n\nAfter consultation with the rest of the family which includes my five sisters, my mother successfully underwent the surgical procedure and today she is up and about.\n\nWe recommend Dr.Abinaya and our family will always be grateful to her.",

Atlast time came at 38 week I delivered a girl baby due to my health issue  and infections we tried normal delivery till last but  we cant further proceed due to infections so atlast LSCS is done and now baby is fine and healthy now .the 2 doctors who said our baby is underdeveloped at 27 weeks it's because of DR.M.H.Abinaya baskaran who took it as challenge  and  made this one finally happen. I respect her from my heart and there are some doctors who are really compared to supernatural powers that's why this doctor profession is still respected everywhere and she is the only one. We can get in touch over phone at any time . When I was suffering from pain at 2 am, at that time also she picked my call within 2 rings really amazing.\n ",

Dr. Abinaya explains every aspect of the medical condition and treatment procedure with utmost clarity and patience. \nAs a pregnant patient, I had an overload of paranoia due to a previous miscarriage coupled with the raging hormones of the current pregnancy. Though Dr. Abinaya noticed my heightened anxiety during those initial weeks of pregnancy, not once did she make me feel bad for having those natural emotions. Rather, she reassured me with her positive and approachable nature and scanned me a few extra times for my sense of peace until my confidence rose. What a magnanimous doctor! Not only is she so professional in her medical expertise but so humane and caring of the emotions and seemingly irrational fears of a pregnant woman. \n\n\n\n",

There is a myth that late pregnancy and especially for a short person is not a easy journey. I was told that chances of normal delivery was less. But Dr.Abinaya never let me down and always made me confident during my visits. She took crucial decision at the right time and I had normal delivery too.

Her advice, the diet chart, online classes, online consultation... everything was very helpful throughout my pregnancy. Though she was busy, she gave time for each of her patients. During this pandemic situation, she was always there to guide nd clear my doubts online. When my hb level went low, she treated it with proper medication at the right time. Finally... at the time of delivery, she was there at the right time and helped me with normal delivery which was what we all needed. When I lost my consciousness she was an active force driving me and made it possible for a normal delivery. After the delivery too... her care and concern towards her patients and baby is just amazing. Now we are blessed with a cute angel. My heart felt thanks to God, my husband, my family nd cheers to Doctor Abinaya \ud83d\ude0a",

My mom was so happy with her advise too...\nHer patience and explaining of the situation deserves a special mention. Looking forward to have a long lasting relationship her..\nYou are amazing doc!!

Till now she is not confirming our pregnancy. Even she asked us to scan after 8 week, once i heared the hear beat from womb then only i can confirm , she said. More over, she  used some non-optimistic words like sorry to say , i can't confirm anything , just pray god like that.. So we changed the doctor for our sake.",
