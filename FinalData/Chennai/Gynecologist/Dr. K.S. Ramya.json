Despite multiple requests, I encountered significant issues with receiving my reports and files promptly. Furthermore, the lack of professionalism was evident in the absence of clinic letterheads on bills and receipts, which were printed on plain A4 sheets with faint toner ink. This lack of attention to detail and failure to provide essential documents undermines trust and reflects poorly on the clinic's standards. I hope these issues are addressed promptly to improve the overall patient experience.\n\nRegrettably, scheduling appointments at Dr. Ramya's Diya clinic was an exercise in frustration due to the unresponsiveness of the staff. Despite repeated attempts to book appointments, I encountered significant delays and lack of follow-up from the clinic staff. This lack of responsiveness not only inconvenienced me but also reflects poorly on the clinic's organization and efficiency. Improved communication and responsiveness are essential for ensuring a positive patient experience, and I hope this issue is addressed promptly for the benefit of future patients.\n\nDr. Ramya K S embodies the epitome of professionalism and expertise. Their polite demeanor and attentive listening skills create a welcoming environment where patients feel heard and valued. With a calm and reassuring approach to explaining diagnoses, they alleviate any anxieties and empower patients with knowledge about their health. *** ***** * * ***** ** ********* ** *** ******* ** *********** evident in their thorough explanations and precise diagnoses.

Any other nausea/Vomit, infection/antibiotics medications will be prescribed for very short duration whenever its needed.We got clear explanation  on the uses and effects of medicines prescribed (which is very rare to see).\n       Apart from NT, Anomaly and interval growth scans and vital blood tests, doctor never prescribed any other unnecessary tests/scans.\n       Doctor prescribed exercises and postures to aid normal delivery.We waited till 36 weeks but kids position was still in transverse and doctor showed that in scan and explained clearly on the complications of pushing for a normal delivery.Since its twins, we can't wait beyond 37 weeks.So we decided to go with C-Section.\n       Like pre-delivery care, we had a smooth experience in delivery and post delivery as well.Doctor made sure that all precautions are taken care (like blood reserve and other crucial things) and also our kids get senior paediatrician attention.\n      We thought, we had to stay in hospital for 4-5 days since its C-section.To our surprise, doctor asked us to discharge on 3rd day morning itself.We had a post pregnancy checkup 7 days from delivery in clinic and stitches were removed.Now mother and two little ones are doing good and healthy.\n      Even though delivery got over and kids are handed over to paediatrician, she constantly consulted with paediatrician and updated us regularly(very hard to find such care). \n\nOur heartfelt thanks  Mam for all the care.You owned this delivery from Day-1 and made us feel safe and confident.\n\nFew good qualities needs to be highlighted :\n\n    1.  24 X 7 availability\n    2. Time spent on each patient, listening patiently and explaining things in layman terms.\n    3. Gives thought about patient's financial expenditure as well.She will make sure to cut all unnecessary expenses and make it  as cost effective as it can.\n    4. Building proper trust with patients (which is the utmost necessity for long term treatment like pregnancy)\n    5. No false information or extra pampering.\n    6. Having history/information of patients in top of mind.(Doctor perfectly recollected my wife's LMP and CBC values couple of times, without looking at the history!!)\n\n\nThanks for reading through!

After a challenging preterm delivery with my first child under a different gynecologist, I was anxious about my second pregnancy. However, Dr. Ramya's proactive approach and expertise immediately put me at ease. She took the time to understand my concerns and initiated precautionary measures to ensure a successful outcome.Under Dr. Ramya's care, I underwent cervical suture, a decision that significantly contributed to carrying my pregnancy to full term, a feat I hadn't achieved previously. Throughout the entire process, Dr. Ramya provided thorough explanations, patiently addressing any questions or uncertainties I had. Her accessibility via WhatsApp for prompt clarification further exemplified her dedication to patient care.Additionally, I must highlight Dr. Ramya's exceptional level of care and compassion during a sudden complication when my cervix shortened unexpectedly. Without hesitation, she admitted me to the hospital and went above and beyond to safeguard the well-being of my baby. It's worth noting that despite the additional care required, Dr. Ramya did not charge any extra fees for my treatment. Her selflessness and prioritization of patient well-being over financial gain are truly admirable qualities that set her apart.Thanks to Dr. Ramya's exceptional guidance and support, I achieved a normal delivery with my second child. Her expertise in handling high-risk pregnancies is commendable, and her compassionate approach truly sets her apart.\u00a0Dr. Ramya's genuine concern for her patients' welfare exemplifies her dedication to her profession and underscores her unwavering commitment to providing the highest level of care possible. I cannot recommend Dr. Ramya highly enough for her exceptional care, expertise, and unwavering support throughout my pregnancy journey. She is undoubtedly a remarkable gynecologist, and I am incredibly grateful for her role in the successful delivery of my child.",

I delivered a baby girl on May 17\u20192021 at Prashanth hospital. I have been married for 3 years. Me and my husband had difficulty in conceiving and hence we decided to get treatment for the same. We checked practo and got to know about Ramya mam and met her for our pregnancy planning. In the first consultation she explained everything clearly and I loved her professional touch. That was when I got confidence in Ramya ma\u2019am\u2019s treatment. We had a couple of follicular study and I conceived. But unfortunately It ended up in termination due to no heartbeat found.  Since I had a other health concern doctor advised me not to delay the pregnancy and she suggested us to go for IUI, as my husband had motility issues. I underwent IUi and by God\u2019s grace got conceived in September 2020. Ramya mam very well assessed me and she knew about my anxiety levels and she handled me so cool. She never got disturbed or never changed her course of action due to my anxious questions or anxious doubts.  The entire pregnancy went smooth for me. Mam took extra care for me since I had other health concerns. My due date was June 16, but On May 17th my sac started leaking and I had to rush to Prashanth hospital where I got my skipped heartbeat back when I saw Ramya mam in the emergency ward. Due to my personal choice and ma\u2019am\u2019s professional advise I underwent C- Section same day around 12 pm I delivered a girl baby and my whole family is now so thankful to Ramya mam. In the last few weeks We had a whatsapp group and mam was there clearing all our doubts, She encouraged me to ask questions in the group even after delivery. I am so so so thankful to Ramya mam. Thank you so much mam for dealing the anxious me \ud83e\udd70 with so much patience! I have my little world in my arms now and I can\u2019t thank you enough mam! \u2764\ufe0f Thanks again mam for travelling with me in this long pregnancy journey!",

But once when we reached out Dr.Ramya, she was very caring & explaining each every stage. She guided us every month very professionally with perfect prediction with easy & effective mechanism during treatment. In fact she cared more on our mental preparation of delivery and followed us with correct detailing about each procedure. She clearly explained even very minor doubts(which was even childish) without any hesitations & prepared me for delivery. She always focus on how to make delivery normal and we went through appropriate treatment. She always had personal rapport with us like other patients and drive us till the import day which we were excited about. Doctor used to suggest easy excercise,home remedy to make feel better everytime and that helped us lot. She always volunteer herself to followup personally.After March when Covid19 season begun, we were clueless & more worried but Doctor was very cooperative giving us much needed advice & comfort treatment. She always avoided crowd & suggest personal WhatsApp communication during the lockdown time. That indeed helped us lot. And finally last week, with Doctor's assistance we gave birth to cute girl in a normal delivery at Prashanth hospital Velachery. Last one week of labour, Doctor used to speak to us over phone almost daily and give us advice. She came to hospital on delivery date & made through normal delivery very easily ensuring no complications to Me & my baby.Thanks a lot doctor.",

Despite multiple requests, I encountered significant issues with receiving my reports and files promptly. Furthermore, the lack of professionalism was evident in the absence of clinic letterheads on bills and receipts, which were printed on plain A4 sheets with faint toner ink. This lack of attention to detail and failure to provide essential documents undermines trust and reflects poorly on the clinic's standards. I hope these issues are addressed promptly to improve the overall patient experience.\n\nRegrettably, scheduling appointments at Dr. Ramya's Diya clinic was an exercise in frustration due to the unresponsiveness of the staff. Despite repeated attempts to book appointments, I encountered significant delays and lack of follow-up from the clinic staff. This lack of responsiveness not only inconvenienced me but also reflects poorly on the clinic's organization and efficiency. Improved communication and responsiveness are essential for ensuring a positive patient experience, and I hope this issue is addressed promptly for the benefit of future patients.\n\nDr. Ramya K S embodies the epitome of professionalism and expertise. Their polite demeanor and attentive listening skills create a welcoming environment where patients feel heard and valued. With a calm and reassuring approach to explaining diagnoses, they alleviate any anxieties and empower patients with knowledge about their health. *** ***** * * ***** ** ********* ** *** ******* ** *********** evident in their thorough explanations and precise diagnoses.

Any other nausea/Vomit, infection/antibiotics medications will be prescribed for very short duration whenever its needed.We got clear explanation  on the uses and effects of medicines prescribed (which is very rare to see).\n       Apart from NT, Anomaly and interval growth scans and vital blood tests, doctor never prescribed any other unnecessary tests/scans.\n       Doctor prescribed exercises and postures to aid normal delivery.We waited till 36 weeks but kids position was still in transverse and doctor showed that in scan and explained clearly on the complications of pushing for a normal delivery.Since its twins, we can't wait beyond 37 weeks.So we decided to go with C-Section.\n       Like pre-delivery care, we had a smooth experience in delivery and post delivery as well.Doctor made sure that all precautions are taken care (like blood reserve and other crucial things) and also our kids get senior paediatrician attention.\n      We thought, we had to stay in hospital for 4-5 days since its C-section.To our surprise, doctor asked us to discharge on 3rd day morning itself.We had a post pregnancy checkup 7 days from delivery in clinic and stitches were removed.Now mother and two little ones are doing good and healthy.\n      Even though delivery got over and kids are handed over to paediatrician, she constantly consulted with paediatrician and updated us regularly(very hard to find such care). \n\nOur heartfelt thanks  Mam for all the care.You owned this delivery from Day-1 and made us feel safe and confident.\n\nFew good qualities needs to be highlighted :\n\n    1.  24 X 7 availability\n    2. Time spent on each patient, listening patiently and explaining things in layman terms.\n    3. Gives thought about patient's financial expenditure as well.She will make sure to cut all unnecessary expenses and make it  as cost effective as it can.\n    4. Building proper trust with patients (which is the utmost necessity for long term treatment like pregnancy)\n    5. No false information or extra pampering.\n    6. Having history/information of patients in top of mind.(Doctor perfectly recollected my wife's LMP and CBC values couple of times, without looking at the history!!)\n\n\nThanks for reading through! Wish you good luck with your medical experience.If its for pregnancy care, Congrats and have a smooth delivery and parenting ahead.\n   \n- Ram & Sri Devi\n    ",

After a challenging preterm delivery with my first child under a different gynecologist, I was anxious about my second pregnancy. However, Dr. Ramya's proactive approach and expertise immediately put me at ease. She took the time to understand my concerns and initiated precautionary measures to ensure a successful outcome.Under Dr. Ramya's care, I underwent cervical suture, a decision that significantly contributed to carrying my pregnancy to full term, a feat I hadn't achieved previously. Throughout the entire process, Dr. Ramya provided thorough explanations, patiently addressing any questions or uncertainties I had. Her accessibility via WhatsApp for prompt clarification further exemplified her dedication to patient care.Additionally, I must highlight Dr. Ramya's exceptional level of care and compassion during a sudden complication when my cervix shortened unexpectedly. Without hesitation, she admitted me to the hospital and went above and beyond to safeguard the well-being of my baby. It's worth noting that despite the additional care required, Dr. Ramya did not charge any extra fees for my treatment. Her selflessness and prioritization of patient well-being over financial gain are truly admirable qualities that set her apart.Thanks to Dr. Ramya's exceptional guidance and support, I achieved a normal delivery with my second child. Her expertise in handling high-risk pregnancies is commendable, and her compassionate approach truly sets her apart.\u00a0Dr. Ramya's genuine concern for her patients' welfare exemplifies her dedication to her profession and underscores her unwavering commitment to providing the highest level of care possible. I cannot recommend Dr. Ramya highly enough for her exceptional care, expertise, and unwavering support throughout my pregnancy journey. She is undoubtedly a remarkable gynecologist, and I am incredibly grateful for her role in the successful delivery of my child.",

I delivered a baby girl on May 17\u20192021 at Prashanth hospital. I have been married for 3 years. Me and my husband had difficulty in conceiving and hence we decided to get treatment for the same. We checked practo and got to know about Ramya mam and met her for our pregnancy planning. In the first consultation she explained everything clearly and I loved her professional touch. That was when I got confidence in Ramya ma\u2019am\u2019s treatment. We had a couple of follicular study and I conceived. But unfortunately It ended up in termination due to no heartbeat found.  Since I had a other health concern doctor advised me not to delay the pregnancy and she suggested us to go for IUI, as my husband had motility issues. I underwent IUi and by God\u2019s grace got conceived in September 2020. Ramya mam very well assessed me and she knew about my anxiety levels and she handled me so cool. She never got disturbed or never changed her course of action due to my anxious questions or anxious doubts.  The entire pregnancy went smooth for me. Mam took extra care for me since I had other health concerns. My due date was June 16, but On May 17th my sac started leaking and I had to rush to Prashanth hospital where I got my skipped heartbeat back when I saw Ramya mam in the emergency ward. Due to my personal choice and ma\u2019am\u2019s professional advise I underwent C- Section same day around 12 pm I delivered a girl baby and my whole family is now so thankful to Ramya mam. In the last few weeks We had a whatsapp group and mam was there clearing all our doubts, She encouraged me to ask questions in the group even after delivery. I am so so so thankful to Ramya mam. Thank you so much mam for dealing the anxious me \ud83e\udd70 with so much patience! I have my little world in my arms now and I can\u2019t thank you enough mam! \u2764\ufe0f Thanks again mam for travelling with me in this long pregnancy journey!",

But once when we reached out Dr.Ramya, she was very caring & explaining each every stage. She guided us every month very professionally with perfect prediction with easy & effective mechanism during treatment. In fact she cared more on our mental preparation of delivery and followed us with correct detailing about each procedure. She clearly explained even very minor doubts(which was even childish) without any hesitations & prepared me for delivery. She always focus on how to make delivery normal and we went through appropriate treatment. She always had personal rapport with us like other patients and drive us till the import day which we were excited about. Doctor used to suggest easy excercise,home remedy to make feel better everytime and that helped us lot. She always volunteer herself to followup personally.After March when Covid19 season begun, we were clueless & more worried but Doctor was very cooperative giving us much needed advice & comfort treatment. She always avoided crowd & suggest personal WhatsApp communication during the lockdown time. That indeed helped us lot. And finally last week, with Doctor's assistance we gave birth to cute girl in a normal delivery at Prashanth hospital Velachery. Last one week of labour, Doctor used to speak to us over phone almost daily and give us advice. She came to hospital on delivery date & made through normal delivery very easily ensuring no complications to Me & my baby.Thanks a lot doctor.",

Coming to delivery, she has a wonderful  team at Prasanth hospital which made the journey to parenthood very smoothly. she is so friendly and approachable even at anytime incase of any queries and in emergency. A beautiful baby boy was born to us and yes, it's a Normal delivery. She explained each and everything to us which makes our life simpler and help us to take timely decision. Thanks will not be an appropriate word to give  back to her for her dedication and friendliness . Overall I am super happy and thanful to Ramya Mam and strongly recommended for everyone who wants to have a sister who can take care of your wife to gone through the Pragnancy phase of their life.Thanks once again Mam.

Well, I could say it is a perfect match result for the search. I went for my Mom's check-up since she got an irregular period after 4 years gap. I was more worried since these days Doctors are keeping safe distancing from their patients and don't talk in nice and soothing manner with their patients. Rather, they want to send the patients as soon as possible because of the fear of pandemic, which is not a wrong thing to do as they have to safeguard themselves. But for some cases Doctors have to examine carefully and all the patients expect to hear some good words of hope. That's the main thing people expect from a Doctor when they go for any medical examination rather than just medicines. When we visited her Clinic with some symptoms, she took her own time to explain and help us understand about the reasons for those symptoms and provided proper medical advice. She is a very kind hearted person. She followed up our test results and conveyed the results to us personally through phone call. Overall we had a very great experience twice and I would definitely suggest her to anyone in search of a best Gynecologist and Obstetrician in Chennai. A big thumbs up for her.\nThanks a lot Dr. for your kind service.",

We finally delivered a healthy baby girl on 23rd April via Normal delivery. During the 7th month, my wife\u2019s scan report showed some complications and we were provided with too many negative informations by the surroundings and other doctors on how serious the complication is. But Dr. Ramya handled it very calm and pushed the baby delivery to full term and that too a normal delivery with such complication. And during delivery my wife was 0% co operative in the labour ward and was yelling at doctor and nurses to do operation but still doctor made it a normal delivery. ****** *** *** *** ** ** **** *** *********** ****** My baby girl arrived at 4.51 pm on Friday and by Saturday morning Dr. texted us for discharge formalities and we were discharged by Saturday evening because If we were extended one more day we would have struck on Sunday lockdown during which insurance claim is not possible and discharge on Monday would mean we would be charged with 2 additional days for the room. This space would not be enough to thank her but all I can say is she is the gynec who treats her patients like her own family member.",

But it was after a year we found that my wife was pregnant and would require additional care due to early diagonsis of hypothyroidism & chronic hypertension.\u00a0 We met her only after 13 weeks pregnancy(referred by my sister) as initially we were consulting another gynecologist. She immediately suggested us to take other tests and this time around my wife was diagonised with gestational diabetes. With no further delay doctor had referred my wife to an experienced diabetologist and since then have monitored her health condition regularly till date. Having so much complication in pregnancy, doctor still planned to give try for normal delivery, but due to constant health warnings in between 35th to 37th week of pregnancy, she had to perform immediate caesarean on 37th week. We have been blessed with little princess on 24.03.2019 and would like to give full credit to doctor for taking utmost care during and after delivery. Even post delivery she is constantly monitoring my wife's health condition on daily basis. We still believe that we are in her safe hands. Thank you doctor for making this delivery look so easy for us which we know was roller coaster ride from day 1.",

I highly recommend her.\nCons: The clinic was very small but since she s very good there were many patients. The wait time was too much. I visited thrice. Every time i didnt get to see her in the scheduled time. Since i have a toddler i planned the arrangements for his care and went but i came back always late due to their poor management. One of the receptionist has a bad attitude. I had to request to let me in after 45 mins of wait from my scheduled timing. ",

It helped me to put my mind at ease. She doesn\u2019t recommend unnecessary scans/tests/medications. She has a personal touch with every patient and always there for any type of queries. She is always positive in her approach and that gave me so much confidence. I myself can\u2019t believe that I made it and this wouldn\u2019t have been possible without her and if it wasn\u2019t her as well. There is some magic in her hand and she is the goddess for me!

Also I had so many doubts and made so many in-between visits to clear them and she handled it very cool. Whenever I ask any doubt even if its midnight she replies through whatsapp. I was so scared of normal delivery but she didn't force me and gave me the choice. But she encouraged me and made me feel positive and I had normal delivery. During my labor I was not cooperating and wanted to get c-section but with her positive words  and motherly care I made it through normal delivery and delivered a healthy baby \u2764. A word thanks is not enough to express my gratitude to  ramya mam. Thankyou so much for creating such a wonderful moment to cherish for my lifetime \ud83d\udc96 ",

Overall, it's been a great experience of interacting with the doctor throughout the entire 1 year. She listened and patiently addressed all our queries at various stages of pregnancy. She also shared her personal phone number and she called us to check on the status multiple times (before and after the delivery). Since we had an emergency pain 1.30AM on the day of delivery, we called her at midnight. Doctor quickly arranged the team and helped us in delivery of baby @ 3.30 AM. We also got an exceptional support and care after delivery. Despite C-section, we could get discharged within 3 days and recover faster. We would like to record our heartfelt gratitude and many thanks for the Doctor.",

Nearing due date my wife had a minor complication in the form of oligohydramnios. Being a doctor myself, I can say most obstetricians would have gone for elective cesarean section. But Ramya mam with her prompt decision making, induced labour at the right time and my wife was able to deliver a healthy female baby through normal vaginal delivery, all with continuous monitoring of fetal well being by herself. This played a vital role in my wife's speedy recovery too. We thank madam for making our journey joyous.",

The support which Ramya mam extended during those tough times were incredible & we are always grateful to it. Even after post delivery the way she contacted us by herself to ensure the wellbeing of my wife in a biweekly basis is quite unimaginable. She used to respond to our plenty of queries without irritation & she is always reachable in our tough times. We are happy and satisfied that we had chosen Ramya mam and would highly recommend her.",

As we were expecting twin babies, Dr.Ramya clearly explained us the foetal development process and kept us informed with what to expect in terms of pain/changes in the mother. This was very helpful. Even if there were risks involved, she explains them in such a way that we remain calm and guided us in overcoming them. As the due date was nearing, she was reachable via mobile for any queries. She also followed up to check the health of my wife when necessary. Finally, we were blessed with a boy-girl twin without any complications due to the efforts of Dr.Ramya. I would highly recommend her.\nThanks\n\n-Mukunthan and Ramya",

We were looking for a gynaecologist very near to our home and found Dr.Ramya. It was a blessing in disguise for us!!Dr.Ramya was very professional, friendly and patiently listened to us always. As my wife had a few miscarriages earlier and is in the 'High Risk' age group, we were a bit worried. The restrictions imposed during the lockdown also increased our anxiety. But the doctor made us feel very comfortable and we had a very pleasant experience in all the consultation sessions with her. She gave us her complete support and the entire pregnancy term went like a breeze with no issues. She took time to explain things in detail and also educated us on different aspects related to pregnancy and delivery. We even had a Whatsapp group during the last few weeks and she made herself available outside regular consultation hours to share Test reports and clarify all our doubts!!We were blessed with a Healthy Baby Daughter 2 weeks ago!!

We usually have consultation from our family Gynecologist who happens to be far away from our house. For proximity we chose Dr. Ramya. This is the best decision we took. From day 1 of our visit she was positive of our conception. We liked her step by step approach and not speeding up the process. At last we conceived after 5 months of trying. During pregnancy, she took the same step by step approach and ensured us safe delivery, answering all our questions with positive attitude. She will not prescribe unless and until if it is much worrying. That made us confident. During the end of pregnancy my water level became low. She monitored frequently and guided us correctly. Mine was a planned surgery. Though surgery was tiny bit complicated she gave a confident reply of not to worry and delivered our baby boy with much care. Now we are proud parents of two children. We couldn't be much happier and we are grateful to Dr.Ramya for making this happen. Her fee was also nominal unlike big hospitals. If you need proper care with nominal charge then Dr.Ramya is the best choice.",

And she stresses on the things that are really important and those things that are not important she asks me to ignore.  As a whole completely satisfied with her treatment.  God bless her abundantly. \ud83d\ude4f ",

Whenever I ask any doubts over phone or WhatsApp, she replies immediately. She spent a lot of time with patients to clear their queries with her smile. She took extra care in every visit. She is treating me like her own sister. I got conceived and it is my fifth month. However, I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism during my second month of pregnancy. She took extra care and gave tablets to normalize the same. Now it is under control. Even in Covid lockdown, she gave appointment in person since I am pregnant. We are expecting our baby by January 2022. Thank you so much madam. I strongly recommend Ramya Madam to friends and family members. ",

All our interaction with her throughout the pregnancy was very good. She prescribed tests and scans in detail and the follow up has been very satisfactory. Our questions and doubts were patiently answered followed by diet and exercise tips from her end. Most importantly she instilled a lot of confidence and kept us calm throughout the pregnancy.\nEven when the pandemic started, her clinic took all the necessary precautions. On a visit to the clinic, we can see that a considerable number of patients consult her. Dr Ramya is highly recommended.",

Doctor is also a broad-minded person and non-judgmental. I liked the way she explained the problem and treatment to me and also the way she took care to examine me. I have been to other gynaecologists but Dr. Ramya was my best ever experience and going forward I'll choose to come here for checkups.",
