"Doctor friendliness,",None,0,0,YES,"I visited her clininic in Anna nagar for my niece prenancy, in 2015,she was very cooperative and attended the case very wisely because it was little complicated. Now again am visiting her for my daughter, since she was so cooperative it pulled me to take my daughter to her. 

People say's she's rude but my experience says she's too sweet and polite, answers appropriately. God blessüôè",2019-03-03 17:06:15,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I had a normal delivery. She never suggests C-section unless & until there is a need for it.
All the credit goes to Dr. Jaishree & her team.
I could blindly trust her.
Right from the beginning till the end she took a very good care of us. I'm very thankful to her & Mothehood hospital for the service.
Thanks much.",2018-02-26 16:03:45,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,"Very rude behavior of doctor. Never spend time to give proper advices. If any question asked then she gives very very sarcastic answer, so that questions shouldn't be asked. Finally she will not appear during delivery. ",2016-06-06 10:08:12,False,False,Deb,,,
