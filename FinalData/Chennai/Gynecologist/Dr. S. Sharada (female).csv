The most important thing I got from Dr. Sharada was a ray of hope. Whenever I talk to her, it was so calming, new hope of leading life peacefully though I have endometriosis. She always treated me as a person more than a patient, understanding my anxiety about my future as a working lady, answering all my questions that I had in my mind about this disease.
