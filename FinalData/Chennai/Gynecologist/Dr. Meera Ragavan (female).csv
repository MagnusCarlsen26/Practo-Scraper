In my mothers case, first assurance was given to me in Chennai that the problem of SUI will be solved after surgery. So we went ahead for surgery in Chennai. But it didn't solve the problem. For the next one year we did follow ups with her in Guwahati taking all the medicines she prescribed but still there was no result. And after 1 year, she says to come back again to Chennai and do surgery again.

Trusted the experience of Dr Meera Raghavan and reviews here. Visited the clinic to test for pregnancy. 

1. Doctor spoke for 2 mins and without giving me time to explain my situation,  started writing tests and medicine.
2. Did not ask me about my doubts or fears, no advise on precautions and how to care during pregnancy. 
3. Asked me to take a package of Rs. 5500 to confirm pregnancy.  It included blood tests and urine sample. PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS PACKAGE..MONEY WASTED. ** *** **** **** **** ******** *** **** *** ** ** *** *** 
4. The main blood test which confirms the pregnancy is beta hcg test ***** *** ********* dr Meera did not suggest and instead wrote this expensive test ** **** *** ***** ****** *** ** *** ****** **** **** *** ** *********  
5. Really disappointed with myself that I trusted her and chose to go to her.
