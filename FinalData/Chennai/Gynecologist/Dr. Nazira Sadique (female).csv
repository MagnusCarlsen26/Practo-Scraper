None,"PCOS,Irregular Periods,Irregular Menstruation,",0,0,NO,Her response was very reserved. Did get proper explanations. I'm still confused as to why my period was delayed. And I think 500rs for consultation was a bit high for the way she interacted with us. ,2017-02-08 18:56:00,False,False,Holy George,"Spent quite sometime explaining. Possibility of hormonal imbalance.  Reviewed scan . As the patient did not want to wait or comeback, gave prescription and called for review.  All answers cannot be obtained in the first visit  without further investigations.  500Rs is the standard consultation fee in any corporate hospital. In fact it is more. There are patients who do not like to accept that there is something wrong with their menstrual cycle and any missed periods should translate as pregnancy.  Apart from consultation for herself there was additional consultation free of cost for her friend.  Doctors are not business people we are treating patients and we need to do further investigations to know what  is happening to her hormonal status. Diagnosis cannot be obtained with a snap of the fingers.  All patients have to clearly understand this.  With more than30 yrs.of experience we have seen many such patients.  So I shall just let it pass. Thank you ",2017-02-14T05:14:17+0000,Dr. Nazira Sadique
