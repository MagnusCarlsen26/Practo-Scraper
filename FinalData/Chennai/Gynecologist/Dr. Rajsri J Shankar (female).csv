"Doctor friendliness,",,0,0,YES,"I had my 3rd child on August 6th 2022 with Dr Rajsri J Shanker. I am so happy to share this review for Dr Rajsri mam. She is well experienced, friendly and very kind doctor. I can't express by words how much I was comfortable with her. She was answering and replying messages through phone anytime. That was so helpful for me instead of traveling for many times. So I am suggesting everyone that if you want to consult during your pregnancy she is the best best doctor.  Dr Rajsri mam thank you so much for everything you are done for me and my baby. You are awesome!! Thank you!!",2022-09-20 07:52:22,False,True,Sobha Daniel,,,
