,,0,0,YES,"Dr Vinutha mam is a well experienced excellent doctor with full of care and down to earth person. She treated me well, everything in a light way and made me very comfortable. I admired her level of commitment and service. She gave good responses to my messages also. I should say she is apt for this quote action speaks louder than words. I am lucky to have her as my doctor who made difficult surgery a successful one.  There is no words to express my thanks to her hence she made me to come out of all the discomforts which I faced all these years. Thanks a lot mam for the **** treatment given for me. I strongly recommend doctor for any OG issues.",2023-06-12 09:54:42,False,True,Manju,,,
,,0,0,Yes,I had consulted the doctor and it was for gynaecology related. Consultation was fine by the doctor.  I can surely recommend doctor to others. There was waiting time in the hospital when we went. It was for one hour. She was very friendly and she gave her number as well. ,2021-06-05 05:53:36,False,True,Anu,,,
