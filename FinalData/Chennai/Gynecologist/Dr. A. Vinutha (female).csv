None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Vinutha mam is a well experienced excellent doctor with full of care and down to earth person. She treated me well, everything in a light way and made me very comfortable. I admired her level of commitment and service. She gave good responses to my messages also. I should say she is apt for this quote action speaks louder than words. I am lucky to have her as my doctor who made difficult surgery a successful one.  There is no words to express my thanks to her hence she made me to come out of all the discomforts which I faced all these years. Thanks a lot mam for the **** treatment given for me. I strongly recommend doctor for any OG issues.",2023-06-12 09:54:42,False,True,Manju,,,
