"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,PCOS,",0,0,YES,"If you are looking for an OBG, who can be rated as best on ethics and professional behaviour then Dr. Parimalam Ramanathan is the right person. I lost my first child due to a gynaec (based on Perumbakkam Main Road), who had very insensitive approach towards patients and unprofessional/unruly behaviour. After scouting and interacting with various doctors on the OMR side (we consulted 12 doctors), we narrowed down on London Harley Street Women and Fertility Center. I told my sob story to Dr. Parimalam and I frankly spoke about my trust issues with doctor based on my previous experience. Dr.Parimalam assured her best.  My treatment started with Dr. Parimalam and I was in my comfort zone because her approach is to advise you all the possible situation/options at every step so that we can take informed decisions. She always puts the well-being of the mother and baby first. Whenever she prescribes medicines/test/taking rest, she would brief me on why this test/medicine has to be taken the short/long-term implications. Never felt she is giving me additional test/medicine than required (because I also do google search parallelly based on my condition).Being a high-risk pregnancy, Dr. Parimalam would always monitor and track my health status. Unlike many doctors, she is available on Mobile/WhatsApp which is a big plus. Also, she remembers your case and need not remind the doctors again-n-again unlike many doctors.For me due to some complications, I had opted for a C-Section after lot of discussion with family. But based on her experience & my body condition Dr. Parimalam advised me that there is a high possibility for normal delivery and counselled me.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I visited lhs during my pregnancy right from my 6th week. Dr. Parimalam who runs the centre primarily is an experienced gynaecologist.

She shares her personal contact number with her patients and can be approached anytime even via WhatsApp.Dr. Shivapriya who assists Dr. Parimalam is very polite, approachable and clears our tiny doubts patiently. Dr.leonard (Dr.Parimalam's husband) is the radiologist who handles the scans.

They give high priority to emergency cases and handle them promptly. The cost of consultation and scans are reasonable.The other helper staff here are very polite and courteous. But they need to be more organised during peak hours like weekends. The main disadvantage is the lack of a proper appointment and tokenised system in maintaining the order of the patients. If someone from LHS reads the review, kindly consider implementing a token system. Including the waiting time, approximately it takes a max of 3 hours to finish a scan consultation  and a max of 1 hour for just consultation. But it was worth the wait time. We just need to be mentally prepared to wait and respect others time as well.There is also a provision to attend special pregnancy yoga classes within the centre.

Would like to make special mention for Dr. Leonard. He would take the time and patience to explain the details to us.

Even a day before the delivery he took the time and patience to do the required scan for us in the hospital..my wife was really tense due to some reason and i still remember the smile and comfort when she saw Dr. Leonard in the hospital ward room to do the required scanning.
After delivery Archana went through a serious complication related to breathing and it was because of the prompt decision of Dr Parimalam and Apollo staff that she came out of it successfully.

"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"the most unprofessional clinic I have visited so far. 
my experience :
my appointment was for 10:30 AM today
I reached there at 10:25AM. After waiting for some half an hour one lady called my wife. I thought she is the assistant and will take the normal weight, blood pressure etc., but to my surprise she stated giving the consultation to my wife and later called me and started explaining  me the course of action and suggested to do ultrasound. It's only when I asked her that I have booked the appointment to see Dr. Panimalar and I was promised on practo that  Dr panimalar will see the case, then she told us that Dr. Panimalar will be coming in some time. After waiting for another one hour, i.e. at around 12 noon, we got the appointment with Dr. panimalar. She suggested to do ultrasound and asked my wife to drink water. After half an hour, my wife told me that she is feeling that her bladder is full and she can not hold it further. I requested the staff to make it a bit quick, to which they replied that within 5 mins they will call, but the y called only after 20 mins when my wife told that she can not hold it. The radiologist doctor was a nice person and did the things well. The doctor further suggested to do blood test and promised that the report they can verbally share by 7:30 PM over phone. 
I asked the ultrasound report, to which they said that you will have to come on Monday to receive the same.
Then I went to the reception  to pay the bill, after paying the bill I asked for receipt, to which they replied that bill you will get on monday. That was so unprofessional. I paid the amount for which I am asking the bill so that I can claim at my office. After I asked the reception that I need the bill now  as I have paid the amount, they asked to wait for another 10 mins for bill. By that time it was 2:00PM. Thus for an ultrasound and consultaion and more importantly the bill, we spent 3.5  hours there and paid Rs. 2400.
This is not the end of the sufferings, as they promised that they will tell the HCG report over phone by 7:30 PM, I called them, to which they said they have not got the report yet and I will get the same on Monday. They are unprofessional to the limit that they can not understand that I was so deadly waiting to hear the report and some good news. 
This was the time when I literally got irritated. Why should I visit a clinic, where the staff including the doctor are not professional enough to keep their promises.
Though I new that clinic is a bit costly still I visited the clinic thinking that I will be at a professional place as claimed by doctor in one of her reply to a Google review.
But I hardly found anyone professional and friendly there except the radiologist Dr Leonard I guess.",2019-06-19 05:30:43,False,False,Anand Kishor,,,

A very friendly doctor I have ever met. She explains all the questions clearly and with lot of patience. She is available over phone almost all the time 24*7.
To have a happy pregnancy I would recommend to visit this doctor. She doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines. And for particular tests to be done, she has adjusted according to our convenience.

Her husband,who is a radiologist there,is also very good. He explains everything very well and ensures we are satisfied before leaving the place. Even when doctor is not available, her child ensures to answer the phone and give a sweet response.
All the staff at the hospital are good and helping at all times.
Doctor has helped me a lot over the phone call and WhatsApp itself to take big decisions about my delivery (unfortunately I had to undergo my delivery at my native). Thanks for this doctor.
If you plan your delivery with this doctor, you will have an additional member in your family list and she will be someone who can never be forgotten for the treatment provided by her.

That was the only one reason we decided to have the delivery in Chennai. During labor, the doctor and her entire team in Apollo Cradle were very supportive and encouraging throughout.  No words will be enough to thank Dr. Parimalam & Dr Leonard and her team for bringing our boy to this world.

A very friendly doctor I have ever met. She explains all the questions clearly and with lot of patience. She is available over phone almost all the time 24*7.
To have a happy pregnancy I would recommend to visit this doctor. She doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines. And for particular tests to be done, she has adjusted according to our convenience.

Her husband,who is a radiologist there,is also very good. He explains everything very well and ensures we are satisfied before leaving the place. Even when doctor is not available, her child ensures to answer the phone and give a sweet response.
All the staff at the hospital are good and helping at all times.
Doctor has helped me a lot over the phone call and WhatsApp itself to take big decisions about my delivery (unfortunately I had to undergo my delivery at my native). Thanks for this doctor.
If you plan your delivery with this doctor, you will have an additional member in your family list and she will be someone who can never be forgotten for the treatment provided by her.

That was the only one reason we decided to have the delivery in Chennai. During labor, the doctor and her entire team in Apollo Cradle were very supportive and encouraging throughout.  No words will be enough to thank Dr. Parimalam & Dr Leonard and her team for bringing our boy to this world.

In our case, she gave the perfect solution for easy conception, which is usually overlooked by other doctors. She always proposes easier and safer solutions for all pregnancy related problems. Dr Parimalam is one of those doctors who strives for NORMAL DELIVERY. Although I was skeptical if I could deliver normally; doctor patiently convinced me to go for normal. She did her best to make sure my labor and delivery was a smooth one. Her positive words and high morale is what helped me go through a normal and healthy delivery. She's very reachable, she replies to your questions over whatsapp and also responds to calls in emergency situations. The clinic is clean and well maintained ; staff are hospitable. The Ultra sound scans are done by Dr.Leonard; who explains the details in a very warm and compassionate way.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,",None,0,0,YES," I would like to say many thanks to Dr. Parimalam medam from my bottom of heart for the help she made us to deliver a healthy baby. We have been visiting her since 2 years for my wife  pregnancy, last week we got a baby.

If you look at the market you will see 95% of doctors are kind of corporate towards their revenue than thinking about the patient's health. But she is totally exceptional there, She is a real doctor, doesn't prescribe any unwanted tests or medicine. She is very down-to-earth, very approchable, never felt nervous while talking to her as she is very friendly and very caring at minute level. Unlike other doctors, she will remember every patient and their problem, doesn't need to refer file to recall patient problem.

Example: At certain point of time, I was very doubtful about early labour and requested her to give steroids to improve baby's lungs. But she rejected my point stright away saying that we shouldn't give any medicine or steroids untill we need them genuinely. 

While we are nearing our due date, she started giving more attention and giving confidence to us by saying that; We are already crossed the danger zone, no need to worry about anything and if you feel any uncomfortable can shout me any time for any queries.

And even she respect people belief, I requested her to do C-section at 6 AM in the morning by taking suggestion from our family priest, She respected our decision and did on requested time with out any delay though it is difficult to manage her personal life.

I also wanted to thank Dr. Lenord sir for the detailed scans and explaining every bit scan. He is unlike others radiologists, never cares about his time, cares about fetal only. i.e. some times his scans goes for an hour to ensure everything is perfect at minute level.

All in all if you need a perfect doctor for infertility & pregnancy (with minimum medication and tests & very caring)  you go to Parimalam with out thinking.

Thanks,

Thankfully, Google helped us to this place called 'London Harley Street Clinic' headed by Dr.Parimalam Ramanathan in Perungudi. We visited the clinic just for a formal consultation. The moment we entered, there's something really positive all about it. That feeling consolidated after our first consultation with Dr.Parimalam. She was all that you wish for in a doctor. Courteous, genuine, disciplined, professional and most of all super well-learned in what she does. We were amazed by her simplicity and holistic approach. 

She made sure that my wife seamlessly sailed through her first pregnancy. Every small detail was explained to us in detail and she has got all the patience in the world to clarify anything and everything you ask her. We never had an anxious moment from the day we visted 'LHS'. The longest waiting time in all of our visits is 20 mins. Amazing thing was Dr.Parimalam has the integrity to apologize even for that little thing. All the procedures were done on time and she made sure that we were well informed about optional procedures and their necessity. She even shares for personal mobile number and you will always get a prompt and proper response. During one of our consultations, my mother who came from our native for a visit, accompanied us and she was sick. Ma'am diagnosed her and apt medication was prescribed. Dr. Parimalam remembered and inquired about my mother's health in our next visits and only after she learned that my mother was all well, she stopped.  That's the kind of attention and care you get. 

My wife had a normal delivery despite some complication and gave birth to a wonderful boy baby in all good health.
