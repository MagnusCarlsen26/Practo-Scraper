None,None,0,0,Yes,My wife had gynae issue so went to hospital. Treatment was fine by doctor. They identified problem very late. The concern was they are taking payment only via cash mode and not on card payment in hospital. They told my wife has to be operated and it would charge Rs 7000 but I didn't carry so much cash that time since everywhere card is being accepted but in this hospital they are accepting only cash payment. Tablets were prescribed by the doctor. There was less waiting time in the hospital. She is recovering and they told her to come after 3 weeks. Hospital management was not good.,2021-04-20 15:54:03,False,True,Rathinam C,,,
