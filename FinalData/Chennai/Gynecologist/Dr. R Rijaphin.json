I am already in love with her.\n\nI was very anxious about my labour as like everyone, but, I wanted to have a normal delivery at any point due to some personal concerns, she understood and supported me personally and professionally beyond any other doctor would go for their patient\u2019s.\n\nEven during the active labour where everyone lost our hope for normal delivery and even my own family started convincing me for C section, where the only person Dr.Rijaphin tried all the way possible and went above and beyond (where she doesn\u2019t have to and simply could have insist me to go for C section as the baby head is not engaged and I was dilated only 4 cm). \n\nNot just during our ante natal visit and labour, she is one sweet heart where she used to follow up even after that and guide me on every single detail. \n\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t have any idea about pregnancy and labour, I swear, Ladies, you can blindly go to her and she would definitely make u feel the same way!\n\nI am super grateful and blessed for get to know her through this phase and I wish all the love and happiness to this amazing women all her life \n",
