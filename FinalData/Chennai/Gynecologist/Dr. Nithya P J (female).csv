None,None,0,0,YES,"""Thank you word would small to say to DR Nithya PJ"".   I am 38 years old and
My IVF journey has started on 26th April 2023.  Now I am 3 months pregnant. 
When first day I met to DR Nithya, She explained each pro and cons about IVF in simple language. 
Always she spoke with me lot of positive vibes apart from medical protocol. Somewhere she  made me very comfortable and smooth to express my self. 
I conceived with first embryo transfer itself. 
Word can not express the love and appreciation to Dr Nithya.  
I would like to recommend her to each and every one.

None,None,0,0,YES,Dr. Nithya is a very friendly and supportive doctor. I am so thankful for getting to meet her. Such a young and dynamic doctor. I am married for six years and been trying to conceive with two miscarriages. She evaluated me based on my old reports and IVF failure. She suggested the polyp to be removed by hysteroscopy and to modify the protocol for IVF. *** ** ** ************* *** ** *** ***** we conceived with the first embryo transfer itself. She is truly an angel. God bless her. ,2023-04-19 15:35:47,False,True,Monika,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,Words cannot be expressed on how grateful I am to Dr.Nithya. She is a very compassionate doctor. We went to Dr Nithya after recommendation from a friend. We earlier underwent IUI cycle outside but it was a  failure. Dr Nithya guided us and explained clearly the problem we have and the treatment plan.She advised us to try one cycle of IUI and we conceived with twins. I will always recommend Dr Nithya to anyone seeking fertility advice and treatment.,2023-02-05 08:33:15,False,True,praveen,,,

None,None,0,0,YES,Dr. Nithya helped us in our journey. She customised the program based on my body. She was always available for us even on Sundays and always had a clear path chalked out for us. She also suggested us in our lifestyle and diet to give a holistic approach. I definitely recommend her for anyone going through the fertility journey. It is hard and it helps to have a doctor who understands your emotions and helps you. ,2023-09-12 12:29:25,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
