"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my experience in detail.

Short review :
    Myself and my wife blessed with  cute little twins (boy-girl) on 24.03.2019 (C-Section).From day-1 my wife and babies were under the care of Dr. Ramya and still are.I have interacted/consulted with few of the top gynaecologists in chennai and with all due respect to all of them, Dr Ramya is the best in terms of professionalism, availability  and personal care.I would highly recommend Dr Ramya for pregnancy care and delivery.

Detailed experience :
     We visited Dr Ramya just for pregnancy confirmation (based on one of my friend's referral).We thought of researching on good gynaecologist and hospital, post confirmation.On our 2nd visit, Dr. Ramya confirmed that we have twin conception.She is  visibly excited like us. 
        Doctor explained clearly what to anticipate (in terms of complications) and what additional care required for twins.Doctor explained that we had DCDA twin (two different sacs) and the difference between single sac and dual sac twins.
        Even though, there is no feed back for any twin delivery for Doctor, we wanted to continue with Dr Ramya purely because of her professionalism and personal care.
        Doctor constantly kept monitoring vital parameters at regular intervals (sugar,CBC,TSH) and prescribed suggestions based on that.Doctor didn't prescribe anything apart from Vitamin and Calcium supplements. Any other nausea/Vomit, infection/antibiotics medications will be prescribed for very short duration whenever its needed.We got clear explanation  on the uses and effects of medicines prescribed (which is very rare to see).
       Apart from NT, Anomaly and interval growth scans and vital blood tests, doctor never prescribed any other unnecessary tests/scans.
       Doctor prescribed exercises and postures to aid normal delivery.We waited till 36 weeks but kids position was still in transverse and doctor showed that in scan and explained clearly on the complications of pushing for a normal delivery.Since its twins, we can't wait beyond 37 weeks.So we decided to go with C-Section.
       Like pre-delivery care, we had a smooth experience in delivery and post delivery as well.Doctor made sure that all precautions are taken care (like blood reserve and other crucial things) and also our kids get senior paediatrician attention.
      We thought, we had to stay in hospital for 4-5 days since its C-section.To our surprise, doctor asked us to discharge on 3rd day morning itself.We had a post pregnancy checkup 7 days from delivery in clinic and stitches were removed.Now mother and two little ones are doing good and healthy.
      Even though delivery got over and kids are handed over to paediatrician, she constantly consulted with paediatrician and updated us regularly(very hard to find such care). 

Our heartfelt thanks  Mam for all the care.You owned this delivery from Day-1 and made us feel safe and confident.

Few good qualities needs to be highlighted :

    1.  24 X 7 availability
    2. Time spent on each patient, listening patiently and explaining things in layman terms.
    3. Gives thought about patient's financial expenditure as well.She will make sure to cut all unnecessary expenses and make it  as cost effective as it can.
    4. Building proper trust with patients (which is the utmost necessity for long term treatment like pregnancy)
    5. No false information or extra pampering.
    6. Having history/information of patients in top of mind.(Doctor perfectly recollected my wife's LMP and CBC values couple of times, without looking at the history!!)


Thanks for reading through! Wish you good luck with your medical experience.If its for pregnancy care, Congrats and have a smooth delivery and parenting ahead.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"I had an exceptional experience with Dr. KS Ramya throughout my pregnancy journey. After a challenging preterm delivery with my first child under a different gynecologist, I was anxious about my second pregnancy. However, Dr. Ramya's proactive approach and expertise immediately put me at ease. She took the time to understand my concerns and initiated precautionary measures to ensure a successful outcome.Under Dr. Ramya's care, I underwent cervical suture, a decision that significantly contributed to carrying my pregnancy to full term, a feat I hadn't achieved previously. Throughout the entire process, Dr. Ramya provided thorough explanations, patiently addressing any questions or uncertainties I had. Her accessibility via WhatsApp for prompt clarification further exemplified her dedication to patient care.Additionally, I must highlight Dr. Ramya's exceptional level of care and compassion during a sudden complication when my cervix shortened unexpectedly. Without hesitation, she admitted me to the hospital and went above and beyond to safeguard the well-being of my baby. It's worth noting that despite the additional care required, Dr. Ramya did not charge any extra fees for my treatment. Her selflessness and prioritization of patient well-being over financial gain are truly admirable qualities that set her apart.Thanks to Dr. Ramya's exceptional guidance and support, I achieved a normal delivery with my second child. Her expertise in handling high-risk pregnancies is commendable, and her compassionate approach truly sets her apart.Â Dr. Ramya's genuine concern for her patients' welfare exemplifies her dedication to her profession and underscores her unwavering commitment to providing the highest level of care possible.

When typed best Gynecologist in Chennai, she was the one to top the list. Well, I could say it is a perfect match result for the search. I went for my Mom's check-up since she got an irregular period after 4 years gap. I was more worried since these days Doctors are keeping safe distancing from their patients and don't talk in nice and soothing manner with their patients. Rather, they want to send the patients as soon as possible because of the fear of pandemic, which is not a wrong thing to do as they have to safeguard themselves. But for some cases Doctors have to examine carefully and all the patients expect to hear some good words of hope. That's the main thing people expect from a Doctor when they go for any medical examination rather than just medicines. When we visited her Clinic with some symptoms, she took her own time to explain and help us understand about the reasons for those symptoms and provided proper medical advice. She is a very kind hearted person. She followed up our test results and conveyed the results to us personally through phone call. Overall we had a very great experience twice and I would definitely suggest her to anyone in search of a best Gynecologist and Obstetrician in Chennai. A big thumbs up for her.

Mine was a planned surgery. Though surgery was tiny bit complicated she gave a confident reply of not to worry and delivered our baby boy with much care. Now we are proud parents of two children.
