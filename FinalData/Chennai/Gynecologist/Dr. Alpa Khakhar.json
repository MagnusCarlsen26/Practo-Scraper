She is one of the  honest doctor I have  met in my life. I was on some medications and my problem was just the side effect of SSRIs. Other urologists told me to do a bundles of tests.... But She told me to talk to my doctor for alternative medications. Now it's been 1 month after successfully tapering off and changing the med I have recovered completely. Thank you very much ma'am for your heartiest help..She not only save my money but also my time. Indeed She is a true Doctor with her extraordinary smile. Lot's of love to her.. \ud83d\udc90\ud83d\ude04\n I definitely recommend her to treat your Urogynecological problems. ",

But She told me to talk to my doctor for alternative medications. Now it's been 1 month after successfully tapering off and changing the med I have recovered completely. Thank you very much ma'am for your heartiest help..She not only save my money but also my time. Indeed She is a true Doctor with her extraordinary smile.
