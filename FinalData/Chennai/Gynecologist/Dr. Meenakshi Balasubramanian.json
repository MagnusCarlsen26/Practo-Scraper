Since it was during lockdown, doctor first asked for our problems in Phone inorder to avoid unnecessary travel due to COVID season. She gave initial diagnosis in phone and told to take us scans and she didn't charge for the initial diagnosis also she told that she will examine in person only if there is a real necessity. But since we need to meet the doctor after results we contacted and went to meet her. She was examining well and took really good time to explain the issue and gave lot of advice with less medicine to treat my wife. We were completely satisfied and i recommend Dr.Meenakshi for those who looking for the friend who can treat not as a Doctor",

She is a cordial personality with great smile who spent enough time with me, addressing my concerns and clearing all my questions in each and every visit. She was available over the calls and whatsapp in times of critical needs. As how others have reviewed, she is available to her patients literally 24*7 and gives us the assurance to reach her even in the midnight in case of any urgency. She is on time to her clinic and we never had to wait longer than 15 minutes to meet her. Her support staff, Ms. Ragi is also very helpful and a friendly girl! Thanks to the doctor for having a beautiful clinic in Adyar so that we dont have to go to a hospital for consultation, especially given the covid times when we are hesitant to visit hospitals! Her clinic is also equipped with basic amenities and equipment because of which we don't have to visit other centers for getting certain basic tests done! A couple of times, when I couldn't make it in person to her clinic, she was kind enough to extend online consultation for me. With respect to her treatment modality, she is a cool doctor *** ******* *** *** ***** *********** *********** sets practical expectations, boosts our self confidence and courage to handle the challenges. I am just happy that it was Dr. Meenakshi who safely brought my baby girl into this world! She is an ammmazing doc and would recommend her any day for anyone!",

Since it was during lockdown, doctor first asked for our problems in Phone inorder to avoid unnecessary travel due to COVID season. She gave initial diagnosis in phone and told to take us scans and she didn't charge for the initial diagnosis also she told that she will examine in person only if there is a real necessity. But since we need to meet the doctor after results we contacted and went to meet her. She was examining well and took really good time to explain the issue and gave lot of advice with less medicine to treat my wife. We were completely satisfied and i recommend Dr.Meenakshi for those who looking for the friend who can treat not as a Doctor",

She is a cordial personality with great smile who spent enough time with me, addressing my concerns and clearing all my questions in each and every visit. She was available over the calls and whatsapp in times of critical needs. As how others have reviewed, she is available to her patients literally 24*7 and gives us the assurance to reach her even in the midnight in case of any urgency. She is on time to her clinic and we never had to wait longer than 15 minutes to meet her. Her support staff, Ms. Ragi is also very helpful and a friendly girl! Thanks to the doctor for having a beautiful clinic in Adyar so that we dont have to go to a hospital for consultation, especially given the covid times when we are hesitant to visit hospitals! Her clinic is also equipped with basic amenities and equipment because of which we don't have to visit other centers for getting certain basic tests done! A couple of times, when I couldn't make it in person to her clinic, she was kind enough to extend online consultation for me. With respect to her treatment modality, she is a cool doctor *** ******* *** *** ***** *********** *********** sets practical expectations, boosts our self confidence and courage to handle the challenges. I am just happy that it was Dr. Meenakshi who safely brought my baby girl into this world! She is an ammmazing doc and would recommend her any day for anyone!",
