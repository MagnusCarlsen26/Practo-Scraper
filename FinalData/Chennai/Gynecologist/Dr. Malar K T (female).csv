None,None,0,0,YES,"This is to share my maternity experience in Cloudnine. After a mishap in my previous pregnancy, we were very worried about our next one and wanted to ensure that we get the best treatment and care so we have a successful delivery. That’s when we came across Dr. Malar’s profile in the website and went ahead for consultation. Truth be told, she handled us with utmost care and compassion. We know we were overwhelmed many times and went to her with many requests but she ensured that all our requests were answered and fulfilled. We successfully delivered our baby and we would not hesitate to say that it is because of Dr. Malar that our dream has now come true. She was very professional and at the same time ensured she gave us her complete attention throughout our pregnancy from the day of conception till the day of discharge from hospital post delivery. A special call out to nurses Jenifer and Priya who were assisting us 24/7 despite of the number of doubts and requests we had. They made it easier for us to be connected with the doctor without interruption and coordinated very well. Also, thanks to Ramu from CRE who helped us with the operational requirements, admissions and other administrative responsibilities. During my admission in the hospital all the duty doctors, nurses and even the house cleaning team were so impressively caring and helpful. Overall we had the best experience with Dr. Malar and Cloudnine, OMR.",2023-06-20 11:14:18,False,True,Sangeetha Ck,,,
