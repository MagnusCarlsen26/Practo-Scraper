I liked her approach as a doctor. I just had calcium, iron, foluc acid n vitamin C supplements throughout my pregnancy. she did not give me any medicine unnecessarily, not even antacids and rather suggested simple home remedies. Even with few complications, my pregnancy became easy to sail through and last month, I gave birth to a healthy boy through normal delivery. Really thank and appreciate her for good work and guidance. I highly recommend her.\n",

She is highly experienced and because of that she has an immensely calming effect on the patient. She does not panic and does not let you do so too, in any situation. She is risk averse and will help you to avoid situations like that. \nEven before delivery she guided us step by step about all the formalities so that our delivery and post delivery experience was super smooth! \nWhen my son was born this April, she held my hand figuratively and literally and I couldn't have asked for more. She is amazing. \nI highly recommend her to anyone looking for an excellent OBGYN. ",

I just had calcium, iron, foluc acid n vitamin C supplements throughout my pregnancy. she did not give me any medicine unnecessarily, not even antacids and rather suggested simple home remedies. Even with few complications, my pregnancy became easy to sail through and last month, I gave birth to a healthy boy through normal delivery. Really thank and appreciate her for good work and guidance. I highly recommend her.\n",

I found Dr. Amudha on Practo and she was my mentor, guide and support in the 9 months that followed and even after. She is highly experienced and because of that she has an immensely calming effect on the patient. She does not panic and does not let you do so too, in any situation. She is risk averse and will help you to avoid situations like that. \nEven before delivery she guided us step by step about all the formalities so that our delivery and post delivery experience was super smooth! \nWhen my son was born this April, she held my hand figuratively and literally and I couldn't have asked for more. She is amazing. \nI highly recommend her to anyone looking for an excellent OBGYN. ",
