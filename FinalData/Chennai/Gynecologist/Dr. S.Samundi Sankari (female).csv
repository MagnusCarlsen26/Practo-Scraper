None,"Fertilisation In Vitro - Embryo Transfer (IVF - ET),",0,0,NO,"I recommend for the people who don't mind spending lot because everything is costly here. In the first visit itself they gave big list for test which cost you around 10 k and prescribed medicine cost to around 3k . For the further process they charge according to your problem. For me they suggested following process.

Step 1. Scan for the formation for the egg :- 1.5 k (this process to be repeated for 3 times) . This helps to see the egg growth and if we have relationship at that time there is a 10 % chances for pregnancy.

Step 2. IUI Treatment :- 4.5 k (this process to be repeated for 3 times). This has 30 % chances of pregnancy.

Step 3. (From this their game starts) Mini or green IVF Treatment :- 95 k this has to be repetitions various person to person. Max they this will repeated 3 times. Success rate 20 %

Step 4. Traditional IVF :- 1.95 Lakhs Max this will repeated 3 times. Success rate 50 %.

Step 5. ICSI :- 3 Lakhs and above this will repeated 3 times. Success rate 50  - 60%.

In the above treatment maximum 80 % will get pregnant if not your hard earned money lost.


Apart from the above points the test & scan which your doing with them they just write in piece of paper. They don't give in the professional way.


Final Verdict :- This is hospital is not for the middle class people. People who don't mind spending then definitely this is your cup of tea.
