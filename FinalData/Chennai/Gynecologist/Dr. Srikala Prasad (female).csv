I'm sorry that your appointment was delayed.
I wish to tell you that almost all the patients had taken appointments except the patients,I had to see for emergency consultation.
Taking care of patients, getting to know their complaints, detailed examination & then suggesting treatment/ investigations which are necessary to them is my passion.
Since I am the only doctor to attend to emergency consultations of my  patients or to attend to urgent call from the wards regarding my patients, we may not be able to stick to the time.
It may be difficult to finish the consultation for some patients faster because of the complicated nature of their problems.
It may not be possible for me to foresee  how many real such tough patients we may get.
I started this appointment  system with the idea to help minimize the waiting period for my patients. 
I'm now wondering whether making it    first come first served will be better for my patients.
