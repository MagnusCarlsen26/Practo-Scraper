None,None,0,0,YES,"Gynecology department- Dr Sandhya Vasan was a blessing to me during my pregnancy. She was friendly , kind and highly knowledgeable. She explained all important things to manage pregnancy easily and clarified all my doubts patiently. I went through c-section but she was the best person to have in the theater to guide you through the fear and all the new moments with the baby. I walked out of Sims hospital in 2 days feeling totally normal solely because of her.
