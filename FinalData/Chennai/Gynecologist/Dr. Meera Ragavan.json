Visited the clinic to test for pregnancy. \n\n1. Doctor spoke for 2 mins and without giving me time to explain my situation,  started writing tests and medicine.\n2. Did not ask me about my doubts or fears, no advise on precautions and how to care during pregnancy. \n3. Asked me to take a package of Rs. 5500 to confirm pregnancy.  It included blood tests and urine sample. PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS PACKAGE..MONEY WASTED. ** *** **** **** **** ******** *** **** *** ** ** *** *** \n4.
