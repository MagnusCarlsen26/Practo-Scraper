So when we took the first appointment with Doctor Nithya she had explained to us each and everything in detail regarding the tests and medicines to be undergone. Thereby after the very first appointment itself we where stress free and extremely happy to have a doctor with whom we could share our worries ,concern and doubts.The most thing which I liked about Doctor Nithya was that she was available at each time I needed her and very straight forward .Throughout my pregnancy  I was very happy to be a patient of Doctor Nithya .",
