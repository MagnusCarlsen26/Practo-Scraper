"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Hi everyone, this is Nandhini blessed with baby boy on 26th May. I was initially in Kanchipuram for first 3 months and consulted one doctor. Next 3 months I was at my MIL place ie Karaikudi,for time being consulted another doctor . When I came back to kanchipuram in 7th month. doctors at my place denied to give treatment & not accept me as they don't hv trust on me that I will continue in their hospital till delivery. So I hv no other option, that time my relative Tanya referred Misha mam to me. I have no one at Chennai to take care of me so initially I was not interested so I just ignored her. Then one day I came to Chennai for some other work ,so me and my husband decided to meet Misha mam once. We visited her once and we loved the way she spoke to us. She was very open and listens to all of our queries and answered clearly. Last 3 months she took care of me.I got admitted at hospital on 24th May as that was my due date and I didn't get any symptoms for labor. She gave gel for pain induce at 24th night, I had contraction that day night but cervix was not open. Next day 25th morning again she gave one more gel for pain induce I had contraction whole day but cervix was 1cm dilated. 26th early morning she gave trips at 5.30am for pain induce I had heavy contraction but cervix was still 1cm only till 8.30am. She tried her best to make it as normal but baby head was not closer so without any other option I had c section and baby was born at 9.03am. During labor she was telling me stories and all even she asked me what song I want to listen and as per my wish she played Ilayaraja songs for me🥰 I made right decision by coming to you mam. I believed you mam and I never regret by going for c section as you tried all possibilities. I saw everyone in this group mentioning you as an angel even I experienced it mam. You are an Angel mam ❤️ we blessed to have baby from your hand😍

 *Few words from my Hubby:* 

First of all i thank Misha mam.I wonder the way she gave treatment with care and transparency. When pain inducing medicine was given to my wife at night 10pm ,She asked me to monitor her and note down the pain level whole night in 10mins interval ie,in 10 min ,4pain in 45sec. I was sending this every hour to her through whatsapp whole night and she was replying back in next min,Iam wondering does Angel don't sleep🙊(sending the snap this might help some future Dad😇).I was really happy and that was a nice experience to take care my wife along with her by sharing her pain(oly Tough task which I did happily🤪).No hidden or trial & error  treatment,it's perfect and her experience speaks everywhere.I was eagerly waiting to go along  with my wife to labor room,Unfortunately It was C section and I was roaming outside like kutty pota Cat🐈.on 26th May,9.03am ,Misha mam conveyed me a happy news that I was become Dad and inside theatre,my wife was listening Ilayaraja songs,(was she kidding me, I was thinking inside🙈) .Iam thanking Misha mam once again and I request everyone to stay safe and vaccinated.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my experience of birth of my Princess. The first time when I visited her, I was really happy with her friendliness, how patiently she answered all my questions and she was so polite and patient to answer all my silly questions as well. But the thing which I really liked about her was, when she said ""you and baby is more important to me, so take care, eat healthy and u don't have to worry for anything else"" and that really touched me. At the very first visit, she asked me to call her or text her in case of any doubts or emergency. I remember, during pregnancy I had little complication and when I called Doctor Misha, she was not in town but eventhough she wasn't here I felt her presence as she managed everything perfectly; she asked me to go and check with a specific doctor and send her reports through whatsapp but what Amazed me more about her was, when she returned back, the very same morning she asked me to come and meet her to make sure everything is perfect.I had bp problem throughout my pregnancy and she was always there to guide me, motivate me and always there with her positive words to overcome any thoughts which was troubling me.When I was near my edd, I got symptoms of eclampsia which Doctor Misha noticed and started following up with me every few hours. I was in awe of her, when she called me like at every few hours to check on my bp and then she called me around 12 in the morning to check if my bp is okay and since it was really high, she asked me to get admitted as we had to do emergency C section. I was really scared cause everything was happening so fast and as my Edd was 13 May and it was only 6th May and at the same time I was relaxed knowing that Doctor Misha is there, as she always took care of me and the baby. I reached hospital around 1: 30 am, Doctor Misha was already on the way and when she came to see me, she said ""she will not take any chance with my life or baby's life and she will take care of everything and soon I will have my baby in my arms"" and when she said those words, that little fear which I had before coming to hospital, everything was gone and I was more n more excited to meet my little one and soon after I am blessed with a baby girl.Really Hats off to her dedication, as even in in this lockdown situation, she was there in hospital early in the morning and she also arranged anesthetist and pediatrician that too around 2 am.After delivery when she came to see me, I was really happy to see her, as she told me that she will make sure everything goes perfectly and I dont have to go through lot of pain. Before leaving the hospital, she asked me to call her in case of any severe pain or doubts. And she was constantly following up with nurses in the hospital and getting update on me and baby.But due to unexpected circumstances I had to get discharge from hospital soon after delivery, even after that she was constantly texting and calling to check on me and baby.When I couldn't visit her after delivery, she did video call to make sure everything is perfect. I am really thankful to Dr Misha for everything she did throughout my pregnancy, for all the care and support and even now when I contact her, she is always there to help me out.Ladies, trust me.. you don't have to be worried about anything, *** *** *** **** ******* she will always make sure that the mother and baby is safe and healthy.To Doctor Misha, Thank u so much for everything, from the first time when I met you; you were always there for me as a sister guiding me, motivating me throughout my pregnancy and I am really lucky that I met you.",2020-05-30 20:16:15,False,True,Uzma,Thanks a lot uzma..😊,2020-06-01T08:18:42+0000,Dr. Misha Pepsi

Previous pregnancy (First child- girla baby- last year)

Last year was very much tedious year for many pregnancy ladies and am a part of that period where I was very much afraid and I couldn't go for my regular check ups properly. I was facing fibroid issue and single umbilical artery. The thing is I had my check ups in one hospital and final stage I have been moved to another hospital because of covid severity which was very much a last min surprise for me. God's Grace atlast me and baby was doing well except with the result of covid- positive which made my baby to loose breast milk. I thought that was my hectic period and I have been saved by God but there was another major health problem which I didn't even notified.

Second pregnancy ( second baby - boy - this month August)

Again I was having my regular check ups with my usual hospital.suddenly at my fifth month I got very much afraid as covid severity was increasing and I was rolled out with the imagination of last year and I thought of put an end to the usual hospital for check ups. Beside this I skipped one month check up (6th month) because of this panic situation. At seventh month I remembered Dr. Misha pepsi mam to whom I went check up for once last year at ninth month where mam instructed me that I should strictly go with normal delivery beyond the visibility of fibroid as it is not going to play a major role in normal delivery and I was very much afraid of normal delivery  which made to put an end to her visit.

To be very Frank at this pregnancy for first check up (7th mnth) I really don't have confidence as I have changed my gyno at last moment. From second check up she gave me very much confidence and i literally says that I want your presence mam pls be beside me even if am stated as covid positive and you gonna move me to some other hospital. This was my tharaga mantra for all check ups I went. Her words were very positive saying like ""you are not going to be in that state and am the one who gonna deliver your baby for sure so don't worry"". Happily 7th and 8th month passed with her positive words.

Here comes the most surprise I faced at ninth month. I was asked to take ecg/echo and I was notified that I have ASD in heart ( hole in heart from child birth). This has been stated in my previous pregnancy report itself but because of covid severity I was not notified about this and I went with c sec without any kind of emergency precautions. God saved me. 

No words to describe this situation. Mam gave me full support and she was much prepared than me for my delivery by getting cardiologist opinion and anesthesiologist opinion. Finally I was in delivery bed for c sec again. Mam the baby successfully and she noticed the fibroid which I had was half decayed and in the stage of spreading infection. It was not planned to remove but it was great that she removed and saved my life.

 These are the words from my heart where I really saw her as my another mom and I felt very much lucky to have her in this pregnancy. 

All the moms here- feel lucky and happy that you are in the safe hands for your pregnancy journey

Once we got positive result in the home test we started searching for a good gyne to whom we can trust. We read multiple reviews and suggestions from friends and its led us to Selva Maternity Clinic and Dr. Misha Pepsi. Since this is our first baby we had n number of questions and doubts throughout the pregnancy. But LUCKILY we got Dr.Misha Pepsi. When we went for the first check up, the way she greeted was so warm and also when the check up was done she said ""Baby is so beautiful,awesome and Happy Motherhood"", with the real josh, which makes us happy and gave strong faith on her.

Further visits we just stopped worrying about pregnancy and we just put everything on her head. Going to clinic became visiting friends home and meeting her became meeting a family member. We literally starts waiting for the consultation date to come. She explains everything in detail, she made sure that her patients are completely aware of the issue, treatment and drugs they are going take. Most importantly she is available for her patients any time. I would like to reiterate the word ANYTIME.

I would like to share an incident happened to us, our baby didnt move for more than 12 hours when i am on my 6th month. Since we started noticing it at night we thought of wait till morning, at morning also we didnt find any movement, we were thinking it as normal and reached her around noon. She immediately asked us to come, when checked she confirmed the heartbeat but to check the movement she advised us to take the Doppler (scan) immediately. Since it was a holiday there were no scan center available to do, she herself called a specialist and make it available for us. We went to the place and waited for a while with all of fear. After an hour we got the call from Doctor to check the status and we said we are waiting for the specialist to come. Soon, we surprised to see our doctor came all the way to the place where we are waiting for the scan and was with us till the baby moves. We were literally impressed to see such thing from a doctor. We could sense how seriously and passionately she is doing the profession.

Doctor will be available 24/7 for her patient. More than a doctor she is such a lovely human who politely answers all her patients queries. 

Love you doctor and just because of your advice and care we have a prince now with us. We are blessed. Thanks a ton Doctor. :) 

Reason to choose:
1. You'll get clear explanation on things
2. Doctor will be greet and treat you with smile
3. Doctor will be available for your anytime
4. Doctor will guide you all the way to normal and happy delivery
5. She is not paisa minded, she is doing this as service, the charges are pretty much less when compared with others in the market
6. You can enjoy your every consultations",2020-07-10 04:49:03,False,True,Anu,Thank u so much anu !,2020-07-10T09:13:52+0000,Dr. Misha Pepsi

Being enjoyed 3 years of expectation for this little eyes to open for us; I and Aashik have learned what the patience is and how it is important when we think of having a baby. It is indeed not something which work likes a machine. Oh, when talking about my pregnancy and my Arlin, how can I forget Dr. Misha? 
My dear Doctor Misha, this truly happened with all your health support and advices, you were amazing and you really are. We were amazed with your support even when I was 3000 miles away and consulting another gynecologist. 
I spent my first 5 months of pregnancy in a tiny island in Maldives which hardly has medical facilities; the Gyne we were consulting was an introvert, and pulling words from his mouth was easier than giving birth I believe. He advised not fly back to India also we need to travel more than an hour by a speedboat to reach the Airport, which made me to spend 5 months in a stoneage. I was helpless and I decided to take an advice over the phone. Amazingly, we had an excellent response from Dr. Misha, she was so helpful and I felt relaxed. Somehow we reached India after 5 months and gave my womb control to My Trust Misha. We started waiting for the beautiful day to come, EDD March 13. Waiting…waiting and waiting….
The day has come, Aashik started planning to arrive on 23rd Feb and I suppose to consult the doctor on 21st evening. I went there to the clinic, felt like a normal check-up. She started checking my BP; boom! It hit 160/100; suddenly she was so much worried and I saw her face, she called the receptionist and asked the other consultant to leave immediately. I and my mother has no clue what’s happening around us. 
Doctor took me to the Anjaka Hospital on her own ride and on her own care. By the time my mom went home to adopt the situation. My BP was being monitored break free and same was informed to the Doctor. She said I can go home if BP goes down, if not we need to bring the beauty out. I was praying god to postpone the date at least for one more day, I want my labor partner to be with me to gaze the first sight of my baby together.  But seems my little princess can’t wait for his dad to come; BP was on the same pace. So doctor decided to bring the little princes out.  I was confident enough and ready for the happiness, I felt painless thinking about the happiness forward. I saw full of freaked out faces around me, I was consoling everyone, and I thought they would do it to me. Aashik was literally crying over the phone and hardest thing was he couldn’t get direct flight, haha.. Saturday night made his travel miserable. My dear Labour partner came after 8 hours, hitting 3 locations to see her new born.
The view! Approximately after 2 hours, I was on half sleep and drowsy, I heard a sweet little cry. Yes! It was first cry of my beauty. My Mom showed the beauty of sweet little face, I still can imagine, she was crying out loud, she was Pink. Her leg fingers and lengthy. Doctor was visiting me every day and keep calling the nurse to know me. I felt a real care in her. Thank you so much Doctor Misha Pepsi and she continuing to care me and my baby even after my discharge. Thanks for your great support…

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"Hi all, Thanking the almighty first of all for giving me grace to share my birth experience with Dr. Misha mam.
Got Married & moved to this area in the month of May2019. Least knowing about the facility available in this locality, within 2 months we had to look for a gynae to confirm my pregnancy. Selva Maternity center was near my place so we just entered only to confirm my happiness. My first visit with Mam gave me high positivity, the way she addressed, the affirmative approach and her friendliness made me visit her again & again. With no doubt within our 2nd visit we confirmed that she is the one gonna be entrusted with my pregnancy.
To mention i’m a person who is allergic or phobic to hospitals or doctors, i’ve never felt anything of that sort with misha mam. It was all the concern, motivation and the right guidance that she bestowed.
The care provided by the doctor at each stage of pregnancy is mentionable. When i was in my 12th week I had complete dehydration, with lot of hesitation I had to call the doctor as it ws a sunday. The way she diagnosed & addressed half cured me & I ws surprised seeing a doctor taking utmost care even when she is not reachable.
In my 22nd week I had severe breathing problem, and mam was not in town at that time, in no doubt I felt her presence in her absence. Admist of her personal obligation she never failed her professionalism, with no time she made all the arrangements of an alternate doctor & treatment before I could reach the hospital & to my surprise her follow up at 12.30 in the night of how i’m coping up made me mesmerized. Hats of to you mam!!
I was in my full term pregnancy & was advices to get admitted in the hospital on 7th April, as the water level started dripping off. From then I saw a miraculous lady spinning around me every now and then continuously monitoring my progress. I was initially induced pain & was under observation for 12hrs within that for every 2hrs even in the midnight doctor was calling my husband to check on my status. I started having contraction early morning but I was dilated only 1 cm but still she waited . I was given IV & membrane rupture, pain increased but still it was only 2cm dilated in the late evening. To mention, her constant motivation on squats and other exercise was helping me to ease out the pain. In b/w baby’s heart rate was continuously monitored & was updated fr every 1/2an hour. Being intolerant to pain I was continuously asking for epidural, knowing that would prolong my labour, Misha mam came out of her way to consider my request. When she sensed that we were panicking I can never forget the assurance that she gave to me and my husband from the Inception “the mother and baby are my responsibility” she gave us full education of all the steps she was taking more than me Misha mam had great determination to have a normal delivery. In the labour room I still remember the words “you are a challenge to me Jasper” I want to do a normal delivery for a person who is intolerant to pain and she did what she meant yes my cute little angel was born on 9th April2020  at 3:23 a.m. 
 I am truly grateful and feeling blessed to have you entrusted with my pregnancy. Thank you so much Doctor. To all the mom’s to be “you are in the right hands” just do as she advices you and trust her completely. As she says “you and your baby will be safe” and I really mean it!

I have been visiting the doctor right from the start of my pregnancy and I have delivered my baby vaginally only because of doctor's efforts and my post delivery recovery is also smooth. The best thing about the doctor is she is available round the clock over Whatsapp/calls to answer any queries which is highly commendable as not all doctors offer such services.  Will definitely recommend the doctor for all women and especially expectant mothers as the doctor never insists on C section unless or until it is absolutely required and guides through well from the start of pregnancy like starting antenatal classes at the right time which definitely help in delivery and recovery. ,2024-05-17 11:10:46,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

*As long as we live, we will never forget the help and love you have shown us.*🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

Dear future parents,

Two miscarriages in the first two years of marriage life, in those 2 times my pregnancy did not exceed more than 7 weeks.The moment when life made us feel unfit to live but Misha mam only gave us a lot of hope.

I remember the mam words to my husband during the second pregnancy miscarriage : *She is my sister and I am responsible for giving birth to her*.

As misha mam way we took some medical tests and finally she found the issues of my past 2 miscarriages. *Very rare case of pregnancy related problem.(Protein s deficiency)* She gave me treatments and proper guidance with care and love .

I got pregnant last year and now a *charming baby boy* was born on C section the 3rd of February.

Without Misha mam this miracle was not possible in our life.

Whenever we go with pregnancy related problems in my pregnancy period.
Mam said that Don't worry i will take care.

 She gave only positivity and special care. That gave a tons of hope for me and my husband.

She shares her pregnancy story to ease our fears We can never forget it mam.

We are blessed to have a dedicated doctor such a nice human being,
We knew that an angel sent by God for usmam

 Love you forever mam💜💜💜 @⁨Dr. Misha Pepsi⁩   .. Infinity thanks to you mam🙏🙏🏼🙏🏼

Dr. Misha Pepsi is truly exceptional.Dr. Misha Pepsi was not only patient but also incredibly helpful throughout my pregnancy. She took the time to address all my concerns, providing valuable information and guidance at every step.I had issues conceiving and had a previous abortion. In the first appointment, Doctor explained everything in detail and she took some tests and monitored my cycle. My periods were irregular and ovulated late. I was monitored every two days from day 11. After treatment, the next month, I conceived.At 8 weeks i had some bleeding issues and was diagnosed with subchorionic hemorrhage. But eventually the bleeding stopped after treatment. Doctor has helped with issues during pregnancy. She was always available via phone and whatsapp.I was mostly bedridden as it was high risk pregnancy.Around 32 weeks, doctor confirmed that everything is fine and she advised to take Antenatal classes. It was offered in the clinic itself. The class was excellent.One of the most remarkable things about Dr. Misha Pepsi was her commitment to my well-being. During the delivery process, when I was initially leaning towards a c-section due to my fears, she insisted on a normal delivery. Looking back, I'm grateful for her insistence as it resulted in a safe and smooth delivery.Doctor advised some exercises during labor and it had helped me for normal delivery.Due to issues during pregnancy, i was demotived and never thought that i would deliver a healthy baby via normal delivery. Every one in my family was shocked. Doctor motived me throughout my pregnancy.I recently moved to kochi and visited a doctor there, for post natal checkup. But i was not satisfied and eventually going back to chennai for check up. After visiting Selva maternity clinic, i didnt like to go to other clinics or hospitals.The nurse in the clinic was also very friendly and helpful.I highly recommend Selva Maternity Clinic and Dr. Misha Pepsi to any expectant mothers out there.

We are happy to share that we are blessed with our little prince on Nov 9th'21. We are very proud to share our pregnancy story with you all.
For 3yrs we were trying for pregnancy and did a lot of treatments in a couple of hospitals but all went in vein.We totally lost all our hopes.
By that time coronavirus started so we thought to continue treatment in a nearby hospital and found Dr.Misha pepsi mam by god grace in June '20.
In the very first meet itself she provided a lot of hope and positive vibes.She went through our reports and guided a straight path to what she gonna follow for the next few months.
""""She always gives us hope by sharing her very own pregnancy story with us"""".She suggested D'LAP for us and told us that you guys will get conceive normally without any treatment.
We believed in her words always and blindly went through for D'LAP .She always suggests waiting for a normal pregnancy instead of IVF. Mams word came true we got conceived the very next month after LAP .
Throughout my pregnancy she took good care & support. She will be always available to answer all my queries irrespective of any time.
From day one we confirmed our pregnancy we went through a lot of struggles and obstacles. But she guided us in the proper way to continue our pregnancy in a healthy way.
Without mam's support we won't see this miracle happened in our life.There is lot more to say but words are not enough !!.

We met Misha maam through Practo reviews. Since I reside nearby, I wanted to find an ob-gyn in and arnd Madipakkam, keelkattalai, Nanganallur. We were fortunate to have met Misha ma'am. 

We delivered a baby girl on June 22nd - 40 weeks 1 day.. Here is our journey with Misha ma'am. I have pcos and auto immune thyroiditis and I had trouble in conceiving for first 3 years of marriage. We visited her and she nearly spent 1 hour to understand the history of us on our very first visit. She then explained clearly the line of treatment she is going to treat us. She took each and every step carefully for us to conceive soon. I used to ask many questions throughout and she always clears our doubts with a smiling face. She used to tell us, u need to ask questions and clear your doubts. It's your right.!

I was induced with gel for 2 times on my due date since I don't have any symptoms of labor pain. But I was dilated only 1 cm even after 2 times and there was no progress. But ma'am was ready to wait and induce another time, Meanwhile baby's heart rate became abnormal and we decided to go for emergency C section. It was an informed decision and on each step she explained pros and cons to us clearly. And we were able to accept the decision we took as baby's health was the utmost priority.

I Personally have to say this. After delivery, she keeps checking on all her patients on daily basis. She regularly comes for visits to our room itself every morning and evening and we can also contact her thro phone if anything urgent or emergency. I was very much down for not able to feed my baby effectively due to flat nipple issue, seeing my eyes she enquired what's the problem and she guided me how to feed the baby and educated me on positions also. She always goes extra step to care for her patients and thier babies. She even advised me to be strong and assured me it's normal to have this depressed feeling right after delivery. 

We liked below points, 
Transparency of treatment given, doctors availability 24*7, prescribing medicines for necessary conditions, avoiding unnecessary medication, doctors friendliness. I felt comfortable seeing her. We highly recommend her. 😊 

We thank you so much Misha ma'am for the positivity you have created in our lives. You have showed us there will be definitely a light at end of a tunnel. 😊

But all we can say is that, Dr. Misha Pepsi is the sole reason behind our happiness.We were at the middle of uncertainties regarding the future of our parental life. Medical history was highlighted by pcod, 9th week miscarriage and non-conceivement.   But the ray of hope began after the first consultation with Dr. Misha Pepsi. We had experienced systematic approach for diagnosis and care. It started with assessing biomarkers to find out what is wrong inside and initiated medications. Very soon we have witnessed the good news, but there started the real challenge.Pregnancy was accompanied by early hyper BP, short cervical length, IUGR and inborn Rh-ve issue. Combination of these things was a clear hazard to our child and mother. These kinds of complications will always make the job hard for a doctor. But the professional skill and dedication of Dr. Misha Pepsi helped us to overcome these hurdles. Timely and accurate medical follow-ups (including cervical cerclage) by the doctor was the real-life saving measures. Each situation was explained in a gentle way and always tried to make us calm and stay positive. There were multiple times we have experienced the dedicated care of Dr. Misha Pepsi.Today we are parents, and that is solely because of Dr. Misha. While looking back at the complications, her role was truly a savior. Now our parenthood can be considered as a living evidence for the professional commitment and care of Dr. Misha Pepsi.  From our experience we truly believe that Dr. Misha Pepsi is a rightful choice for any couple who wants to be parentsFinally, all we can say is a big thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

This is Prasuna. I am here to share my delivery story with you all. We visited Dr. Misha Pepsi through Practo review.  In the 1st visit itself Doctor gave us good news by confirming my pregnancy. And she also analyzed the complete medical condition of mine based on that she started the treatment and suggested the tablets to follow. Regularly she will be available for all our doubts via WhatsApp also. During my last few weeks of pregnancy term when we visited doctor for regular check up she told my BP is slightly high and unstable and my water level also in the border line and asked me to get admitted in Anjakha Hospital immediately. But unfortunately Dr. Misha couldn't attend my delivery based on her some personal emergency but she informed required people in hospital for my delivery and also she constantly followed up with them for the status during her emergency situation too. She told us not to worry and I will be in safe hands. We believed Misha words completely. By God's grace we are blessed with Boy Baby on 28th April 2021. Misha was in constant touch in phone call whenever required until my discharge from hospital. Post delivery also she clears all our doubts via WhatsApp. We are really mesmerized by her passion & service she is contributing to all. She is a real diamond. Thank you Dr. Misha Pepsi for all the love and care you shower upon us. We wish you to continue this service to the society always. God Bless you immensely & wish you all the luck that you deserve.

She told she will cure my problem with in 6 month but by gods grace and continous care of Misha ma'am i got conceived in the next month itself. Throught my pregnancy she has taken good care. She will be always available for my queries, time doesn't matter. During my labour she guided me very well and keep on monitoring. I dont think no doctor would care her patient like her this much. She motivated during my pains. Whether its day or mid night, she was present there during my emergency situation.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Hi all. I'm Deepika. After returning from my native to in-laws during my 6th month, I was stressed out on where to continue my monthly check-up. I came across doctor's profile in practo with so many good reviews. With full of hope I started my treatment with Dr.Misha mam. From the very first time she has been very friendly and has taken great care of my health on all my routine check-ups. Not only she listens to all my concerns and doubts but also very patiently explains about it. Even when I felt low health-wise doctor always built up my confidence and says ""you and your baby are important to me"". That has always boosted me up. During my 37th week I suddenly got nagging pain with spotting. Informing doctor about this she immediately asked me to get admitted and on examining doctor suspected if the baby would have passed meconium stool. Still she encouraged me to try for normal delivery and kept tracking FHR. Though we kept trying for normal delivery with continuous nagging pain for two days, I was totally drained out when I was induced. With no energy to bear pain anymore finally I insisted for C-section. As suspected by doctor baby had passed stool but with God's grace and doctor's help I safely delivered baby boy on October 24th. I feel so happy on finding such a great doctor who is down to earth providing the best treatment and care to her patients. I pray the almighty to bless doctor and her family that she continues to give the bestest medical practice throughout.

I got married and moved to Chennai by end of 2018,would like to share my experience on Selva maternity centre.Being new to the place, it's hard to find a Hospital/Clinic around with proper Facility around.To confirm my pregnancy we were Searching in Practo for doctors around and going through every reviews, luckily we came across Dr.Misha Pepsi mam's profile, was stunned to see such positive reviews and immediately decided to visit her.Our first visit was on 17 Dec, While waiting we were attracted to the board filled with letters. It was so amazing to see the experience and feedback from so many monthers while waiting there. Honestly I have never seen such positivity and life-changing experiences. Misha mam checked me and confirmed my pregnancy. She explained everything clearly and guided on how to be and what to follow during this phase. We visited her for the monthly check ups and every visit clearly shows why ppl prefer to visit such a patient friendly and always approachable doctor. Unlike many others I noticed Misha mam spends enough quality time with each patient and addressing all the queries instead of rushing.We can blindly follow what she suggests and prescribes as her approach is more practical and person based.Things were good until covid hit the city, we couldn't visit the centre for check ups, yet Misha mam was always approachable on phone(WhatsApp) and guided for the tests to be taken in near centres and reviewing the results.Due to rising covid cases we were forced to plan the delivery at hometown, I left Chennai in May 2020 and was blessed with a Prince on July 30, it was a Normal delivery and baby was healthy too.once again thanks a lot Misha mam!",2020-09-12 11:23:43,False,True,Uma,Thanks a lot,2020-09-12T14:32:16+0000,Dr. Misha Pepsi
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"‌Hi, I would like to share how my little angel came into this world before 2 months with great support of Dr. Misha Pepsi. I had my first miscarriage at 5 weeks in March, 2019. After that I conceived again in  June, 2019 and I started consulting Dr. Misha. My pregnancy was a high risk one and she took  a really great care of me through out the pregnancy. I had cervical incompetency and had to take stitches during 6th month. I was in tension but Misha mam gave me assurance that I should not worry and she told that your child is precious to me and its my responsibility, you just dont worry and stay happy. Once, i started bleeding and got admitted again. So overall I got admitted 3 times before delivery and Misha mam was a great support all the times. Finally at 33 weeks and 5 days, my pain started. It started around 12 pm and we rushed to hospital, and we all wanted normal delivery, so we waited till night. Dr. Misha was there with me all the time and giving me strength along with my husband. She also wanted normal delivery and waited till night. Finally I delivered my princess at 12.25 am and she was premature, she needed immediate attention, she was moved to another children's hospital and Dr. Misha was in constant touch with pediatrician  whole night. She didn't even sleep and she was in hospital only till morning 6 am. She left the hospital only after confirmation that mom and baby are safe.  Mam, thank you so much for all your support and raking really good care of me during pregnancy. I strongly recommend her for normal delivery and her very caring nature.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy is a wonderful period to be relished in one's lifetime. A period filled with excitement coupled with  fear and anxieties at times ,as d experience varies with women.
This period is made even more beautiful and memorable with the near and dear ones. One such is d gyno whom we choose. After d missed periods it would be a tough job to find a 'good gyno 'as the choices would be many made upon d experience, approach, proximity etc etc... I didn't have d confusion to choose one because Dr.Misha is a fellow Dominican, my schoolmate who was my senior and I used to call her  sister.
Well Connected and came to know her service through fb, was following all her posts too....I consulted her  before marriage everything was fine  except for a small hormonal change.
 Every doc is unique,she has her own style of attending d patients with  her mesmerizing talk and smile.A caring attitude and approchability  spotted a difference . I felt dat I was in  my 'comfort zone'. Dats wat made me to decide and  chose her to handle my pregrancy eventhough her clinic was quite far.

I was in my advanced maternity age so I was worried .With every visit all my worries faded. I was  very particular to have a normal delivery .With her advise and confidence given I was able to handle my preggy well. I was suggested to   join pregnancy classes tutored my Kavitha Venkatesan ma'am. A special note of thanks to Kavitha ma'am whose classes were really informative , helpful and that would be an added advantage in making one self active during anti and post  pregnancy period. It was a stress buster for a working woman like me esp those dances are to be highlighted.

1..2...3..here we go it was like a roller coaster ride and there I was in my last month of preggy waiting for my lil one. I was on work even though my due date was approaching quite near. With a week's time ahead I had my amniotic sac broken and was admitted in d hospital.
Dr. Misha was constantly monitoring me and my baby, from morning 7 o clock .With every delivery case hoping for a normal one ,she tried her best to make mine  normal.Her assurance saying' with no compromise in both baby's and mother's  health I would wait and go for a normal delivery ' was a booster to me. The child's heart beat was monitored at regular intervals. All the efforts were futile even after  inducing pain  ..the water level was also monitored as it was being reduced. My lil one's heart beat was quite flat and was not satisfactory in d evening as d water level was reduced. I wanted to taste and  experience d  labour pain 
But god's plan was different for me.I was operated at 7 in d late evening cos baby's head didn't engage and ther was no signs of labour pain.
With a heavy heart I was operated . But my worries disappeared like dew d very minute I saw my replica...yeah it was' junior shanthi' ...👩‍👧

Kudos to Dr.Misha who was made my pregrancy journey a beautiful one..

For all the expectant moms you would b safe in  Dr.Misha's hands.
 
And thus d curtain closes ""With a Dominican delivering  a fellow Dominican"".

Me and my husband have known Misha mam for long time. Once I came to know that I was pregnant she was our go to person. 
Pregnancy Journey
Throughout my pregnancy I had few hiccups and Misha mam was there like a guardian angel to guide us. Right from referring to another stream doctor for a second opinion and giving me the confidence, I needed to carry out my pregnancy journey peaceful.
Labour Journey
Misha mam right from the starting of the pregnancy she always encouraged to do lot of activities and ensured for natural birth. But I had to go emergency C section delivery, since the baby heartbeat started going down, I was so sacred but mam was there and explained what is the process included and even in the OT she spread her magic positive aura by putting songs to relax my mind and handed my son to me which is a surreal feeling given by Misha Mam forever grateful for that. Her OT team is the best in all means.
Post OP Recovery 
Post the operation she made sure I was recovering at a good speed and health. She also made sure I had to do the Post OP 6-week check-up which is very important because a “happy and healthy mother gives a healthy baby’’. 
Always and forever grateful for this beautiful pregnancy journey to Misha Mam.

From 5 th month MISHA mam suggested to  start doing my exercises with help of tamizh mam ,those exercises helped me throughout the journey of pregnancy , with the  positive support and guidance . I wished to go for VBAC ,she supported me in all ways she guided me throughout the journey.On dec'18 th , early morning pain started i was observing whether it's false pain or true one ..As time goes on pain started to increase ,i called mam and went to hospital she came and checked and got admitted immediately , throughout the day i was in labour she checked me often and monitored baby's health . Evening the pain was intense but my labour was too slow and i opted for C -Section that night .In OT mam said one word that I don't regret  for doing C-section ,since my previous scar was week due to labour pain and my baby had passed meconium . Timely decision matters ,i too never regret for opting c section in last minute .After delivery ,she visited often until the day of discharge.And till now she is guiding in all ways when I call her or visit her.Great human soul she is,I would highly recommend her for pregnancy checkups and delivery 👍😊",2023-01-06 08:13:24,False,True,Geetha,Thanks a lot Geetha ..,2023-01-08T12:18:24+0000,Dr. Misha Pepsi

I couldn't post my pregnancy experience due to hectic work. As we recently celebrated my son’s first bday, thought this would be the perfect time to share my happy pregnancy and delivery experience. I always wanted to thank the angel (Misha mam) who brought my son into this world. I got pregnant in US and came back to India when I was 4 months due to home sick and other reasons. Me and my husband was searching for a gynecologist close by my area where we came across Misha mam with very good review. During the first visit itself, I felt I was lucky to meet her becoz of her confidence and motivation. Everything went good and she took atmost care of me and baby. She never hesitated to answer the calls during odd hours and if we didn’t give her call back, she will follow up on the situation. She tried her best to deliver my baby normally but due to decrease in heartbeat level and cord twisted around the baby neck, it happened to be cesarean. After couple of months, same situation happened to one of my friend’s cousin where doctor delayed and they couldn’t save the baby. At that moment, I thanked Misha mam zillion times for her timely action. Irrespective about the mode of delivery, I am now back to my normal life because of her motivation and able to do all the work. Now my son started called me with the most beautiful word ‘AMMA’ and thank you Misha mam for giving me this precious gift.

My wife did all the exercise which we suggested and the results were showing positivity when we met the doctor every month / week until the delivery.  It was nearly her due date and the doctor was in no hurry and she waited for normal pain to try her level best. We waited , waited and waited but the baby's head never came down and we finally hard to go for Caesarion. 

End result (Normal or C section) was not a factor but the effort and comfort that you get from Misha Pepsi is highly incredible. 

Just before the day of delivery - she stayed with us in hospital anticipating pain anytime which I believe no doctors would do. She was with us for whole night until 9am next day before the baby was born. 

She kept following up every hour and was monitoring my wife regularly. After 6 months my wife did contacted her through whatsapp for gynac related illness and she was following up until she got to know my wife is back to normal.

We were new to Chennai when my wife was pregnant. We have not known where to go for checkup. After i searched multiple doctors in online then I found a highly positive reviews for one Doctor that is Misha mam. Without any second thought we went to her.After the first check up we decided we should not worry about anything in the whole pregnancy period because Misha mam is there. That kind of confidence we got in the first check up itself. Then we regularly went to check up and we got all the doubts cleared in the layman language.She have cleared each and every step in a simple manner. She is easily accessible.Unfortunately we have not completed our full pregnancy period in Misha mam's hand.We went to our hometown and locked because of COVID19. Even then also we have called regularly and she had given prescription in the call itself.We continued all the tablets in the whole pregnancy period.At last My son born before 1 month from due date without any complications. He is totally healthy.
Now also we have called and gets our doubts cleared regarding vaccination.
