"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,Pregnancy Check Up,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"     As an expecting mother, I was adamant in my view that the body can heal itself without any kind of medical intervention. I was stubborn that my pregnancy should be of the same path. I am a sportsperson since my childhood and active even now. I had heard experiences of mothers where, even during normal birthing, they had taken supplements during their pregnancy and used medical interventions during child birth. That's when I realised that there were not just 2 types of birthing (Normal and C-Section) but a third, NATURAL Birthing. So with this perspective, I was searching for a Doctor who would understand my views w.r.t. medicine. I was anxious, as many Doctors in today's world lean toward prescribing high medicine dosage. I went through various doctor reviews when I came across Dr. Abinaya who stood out as the perfect fit. The first time I went for a consultation I had explained to her what was on my mind, to which she was cautious, but supportive, given my history of exercise regimen and natural vegetarian diet. She said she will support and co-operate as long as I continue to take care of my diet and exercise. Dr. Abinaya was informative, she understood and appreciated this view and didn't prescribe or compell to take any medicine. She guided me with a natural diet, exercise and suggested HypnoBirthing sessions with Padma Ganapati. This co-operation was seen throughout the pregnancy. Dr. Abinaya had conducted a nutrition and yoga session for expecting mothers. 
     Even during the critical time of COVID19, she was available for consultation through calls or WhatsApp and was immediately responsive to any queries I had. On the big day, Dr. Abinaya immediately responded and co-ordinated with the Hospital to admit and take care. She had even instructed the Hospital to act according to my birth preferences which I had provided to her previously. My mother was with me as my BIRTH PARTNER, for the entire duration of birthing. Dr. Abinaya and the Hospital staff avoided IV, medication or any other medical intervention and took the entire process during labour in a smooth and composed manner toward a natural birth. All the nurses in the Hospital cooperated with Dr. Abinaya and us. This was an amazing experience for me. If any expecting mother needs more information on my experience so that they will feel more confident to go along this path, please feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, I will be more happy to vouch for Dr.Abinaya.
Our special thanks and salute to Dr.Abinaya of Sai Ram Fertility & Maternity Clinic, T.Nagar, Chennai.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"My first pregnancy was a miscarriage, and it came out naturally. Then my second happened after 6 months, but again I had spotting during that time. I was worried, as many doctors in Chennai lean toward prescribing medicine/injections for my situation, but I was adamant that everything should be done naturally. My husband went through various doctor reviews in Practo and Google. He came across Dr. Abinaya, going by her patient story. She checked me in January and told me a sac was seen, nothing to worry about, just an injection would do to stop the bleeding, but I said I would like the process to be natural. She agreed and asked me to take rest for a few days and to take an early pregnancy scan. She also warned me that if the bleeding doesn't stop, the one solution is injection. But thank God, by a few days, the bleeding stopped and everything was OK. i went on regular check ups and she asked me to join a class after 3 months, which was necessary for me cos i was opting for a natural birth and the fee was very nominal...i had lot of small doubts on the process which mam would clear on whatsapp and if its major she would ask me to come...on the big day after 37 weeks i got the pain at midnight i went to the hospital and the duty doctors were informing Dr. Abinaya. She came around 4.30 am and I delivered a girl baby vaginally and naturally. I asked her about the episiotomy process and she told me that it would tear somewhere so it was better to do this so i agreed for that. I was there in the hospital for 3 days and mam was following up on the situation..If any expectant mother needs more clarity on my experience, feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, Just trust her blindly and she'll guide you on the right path..

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"This is a very very long review and do take time to read it as it will be very useful for people who is anticipating to become pregnant. I’m a Srilankan and I would Highly recommend Dr Abinaya for her utmost caring, follow-ups and professionalism in treating International patients. I met Dr Abinaya through one of my Indian friend as I have been married for 9 years and was not pregnant until I Met Dr Abinaya.

 You guys can imagine the hurdles, troubles I would have gone through when everyone asks “Do you have kids”.  I went to almost all hospitals in Srilanka, met many gynecologists, spent lakhs and lakhs of money in Srilanka, did 3 cycles of IUI and tried almost all medicines prescribed by Srilankan doctors but nothing worked out.

I flew to India as advised by my Indian friend and stayed in India for 5 days to continue my treatment. She does not take chances or treat patients based on assumptions. At the same time, she does not burden us with unwanted tests. Doctor Abinaya advised us only for important tests and finally the report revealed that I have “PCOS” and nobody in srilanka told us about it and was generally sent for “IUI” treatment. Doctor Abhinaya gave me medicine’s and advised to follow it up for 3 months, I did what doctor said and I’m very much happy to say that I’m 3 months pregnant now. 

I visited India only 2 times to her clinic and Doctor Abinaya did what Srilankan Doctors can’t do. First time I have seen such a dedicated doctor who cares for the patients, explains clearly on what she is going to do, what I need to do, what’s the next plan etc, which ideally helps international patients like me to understand it easily. Doctor Abinaya has removed all my tears & problems which is a disguise in a bliss. 

I can’t thank you enough and thank you is a small word for the things you have done to us. we need doctors like you in Srilanka as there are so many women’s who are anticipating for a baby in srilanka and I’m definitely going to refer you to them. Having struggled with infertility for so long, we fully understand the emotional, physical and mental stress and trauma this causes and would certainly recommend Dr Abinaya for the couples who are trying to conceive. Thank you once again Doctor.

She is truly an exceptional doctor, and I can’t praise her enough.  In short, we had a great experience with Dr. Abinaya and her clinic have set the bar very high in patient care and the treatment of PCOS. She was the first doctor I met with who took the time to put all the pieces together and explain the complicated dynamics of PCOS. From the very first appointment I knew that Dr. Abinaya was invested in my health and wellbeing.

For the past 5 months that I was under her care, I was struck by her personal, individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering my questions, often anticipating them. I was further impressed with her incredible professional responsiveness in terms of communication. She responded to watsapp and phone calls within the same day and always contacted me personally after lab results came in. These qualities alone would have set her apart from other gynecologist.
We have been here several times and never been disappointed. The doctor is super friendly & you’re able to schedule an appointment online.

I've managed to get in to be seen within a timely manner & even without an appointment.

After the second visit, the Doctor confirmed that my mother was having mild discharge of blood from the uterus and suggested possible issues. Due to her age, my mother and I were both very perturbed and upset. However, the Doctor reassured us that treatment was possible and importantly my mother seemed convinced about the same.

Over the next week, my mother underwent a slew of tests, the Doctor diagnosed that there was a cancerous growth and described in detail , the treatment plan of removing the Uterus (Hysterectomy).

After consultation with the rest of the family which includes my five sisters, my mother successfully underwent the surgical procedure and today she is up and about.

Dr. Abinaya explains every aspect of the medical condition and treatment procedure with utmost clarity and patience. 
As a pregnant patient, I had an overload of paranoia due to a previous miscarriage coupled with the raging hormones of the current pregnancy. Though Dr. Abinaya noticed my heightened anxiety during those initial weeks of pregnancy, not once did she make me feel bad for having those natural emotions. Rather, she reassured me with her positive and approachable nature and scanned me a few extra times for my sense of peace until my confidence rose. What a magnanimous doctor! Not only is she so professional in her medical expertise but so humane and caring of the emotions and seemingly irrational fears of a pregnant woman.

Though Dr. Abinaya noticed my heightened anxiety during those initial weeks of pregnancy, not once did she make me feel bad for having those natural emotions. Rather, she reassured me with her positive and approachable nature and scanned me a few extra times for my sense of peace until my confidence rose. What a magnanimous doctor! Not only is she so professional in her medical expertise but so humane and caring of the emotions and seemingly irrational fears of a pregnant woman.
