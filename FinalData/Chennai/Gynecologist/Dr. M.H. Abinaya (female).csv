"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,Pregnancy Check Up,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"     As an expecting mother, I was adamant in my view that the body can heal itself without any kind of medical intervention. I was stubborn that my pregnancy should be of the same path. I am a sportsperson since my childhood and active even now. I had heard experiences of mothers where, even during normal birthing, they had taken supplements during their pregnancy and used medical interventions during child birth. That's when I realised that there were not just 2 types of birthing (Normal and C-Section) but a third, NATURAL Birthing. So with this perspective, I was searching for a Doctor who would understand my views w.r.t. medicine. I was anxious, as many Doctors in today's world lean toward prescribing high medicine dosage. I went through various doctor reviews when I came across Dr. Abinaya who stood out as the perfect fit. The first time I went for a consultation I had explained to her what was on my mind, to which she was cautious, but supportive, given my history of exercise regimen and natural vegetarian diet. She said she will support and co-operate as long as I continue to take care of my diet and exercise. Dr. Abinaya was informative, she understood and appreciated this view and didn't prescribe or compell to take any medicine. She guided me with a natural diet, exercise and suggested HypnoBirthing sessions with Padma Ganapati. This co-operation was seen throughout the pregnancy. Dr. Abinaya had conducted a nutrition and yoga session for expecting mothers. 
     Even during the critical time of COVID19, she was available for consultation through calls or WhatsApp and was immediately responsive to any queries I had. On the big day, Dr. Abinaya immediately responded and co-ordinated with the Hospital to admit and take care. She had even instructed the Hospital to act according to my birth preferences which I had provided to her previously. My mother was with me as my BIRTH PARTNER, for the entire duration of birthing. Dr. Abinaya and the Hospital staff avoided IV, medication or any other medical intervention and took the entire process during labour in a smooth and composed manner toward a natural birth. All the nurses in the Hospital cooperated with Dr. Abinaya and us. This was an amazing experience for me. If any expecting mother needs more information on my experience so that they will feel more confident to go along this path, please feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, I will be more happy to vouch for Dr.Abinaya.
Our special thanks and salute to Dr.Abinaya of Sai Ram Fertility & Maternity Clinic, T.Nagar, Chennai.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"My first pregnancy was a miscarriage, and it came out naturally. Then my second happened after 6 months, but again I had spotting during that time. I was worried, as many doctors in Chennai lean toward prescribing medicine/injections for my situation, but I was adamant that everything should be done naturally. My husband went through various doctor reviews in Practo and Google. He came across Dr. Abinaya, going by her patient story. She checked me in January and told me a sac was seen, nothing to worry about, just an injection would do to stop the bleeding, but I said I would like the process to be natural. She agreed and asked me to take rest for a few days and to take an early pregnancy scan. She also warned me that if the bleeding doesn't stop, the one solution is injection. But thank God, by a few days, the bleeding stopped and everything was OK. i went on regular check ups and she asked me to join a class after 3 months, which was necessary for me cos i was opting for a natural birth and the fee was very nominal...i had lot of small doubts on the process which mam would clear on whatsapp and if its major she would ask me to come...on the big day after 37 weeks i got the pain at midnight i went to the hospital and the duty doctors were informing Dr. Abinaya. She came around 4.30 am and I delivered a girl baby vaginally and naturally. I asked her about the episiotomy process and she told me that it would tear somewhere so it was better to do this so i agreed for that. I was there in the hospital for 3 days and mam was following up on the situation..If any expectant mother needs more clarity on my experience, feel free to contact me through Dr. Abinaya, Just trust her blindly and she'll guide you on the right path..
