She respects the patient's comfort and concerns *** ******* ***** *** ******* *** ******** ************* which is really very sweet and kind of her. Such a thing is not very common in other OB/Gyn doctors. She answers all our queries and helps us with whatever pregnancy-related issues we may be facing. \n\nEspecially during my labour process, she was  so completely involved that it made me feel at ease and more confident to go through my labour process with her continuous help, advice and supervision even though my labour process was a bit prolonged. She's so experienced and ************* that it surely reduces your anxiety in the labour room knowing that you and your baby are in safe hands. Sometimes doctors can make you feel more scared, tensed and anxious during your labour and it really makes things worse for the patient who is already trying to cope up with the contractions but Dr. Nazira ma'am made sure I was comfortable throughout the process and she always listened patiently to what I had to say during that time. She made sure that I was taken care of properly during and after my labour process and didn't allow any unnecessary disturbances towards me since I had just gone through a lot of pain and exhaustion. \n\nEven after the delivery, she would visit me every day during my 3-day stay in the hospital to make sure I was healing well and ask me if I have any concerns whatsoever. Not all doctors are this kind and sweet while being so experienced *** ************* at the same time! I'm really so thankful to Dr. Nazira ma'am for taking care of me so well throughout my pregnancy and delivery and even post-delivery. It was truly a very good experience. I would highly recommend this doctor to anyone expecting. *** ** *** **** **** ***** ** **** ",

I'm a foreigner and I didn't know what to expect for gynecologists in India. I've heard that many doctors resort to C-section here even if the mother can delivery normally. Dr Nazira asked for my preferences for different things (type of delivery, if I wanted epidural or not, etc.) and respected my choices. She also monitored me closely towards the end to make sure the baby was OK as I was having some problems. Furthermore, she was present for the delivery although there was an Indian festival which she celebrated that day. I was very happy, relieved and grateful when the registra told me that Dr Nazira was on her way to the hospital as I was told by some other people who visited other gynecologists in another hospitals that their gyne didn't come at time of delivery. I definitely recommend Dr Nazira and Cloudnine Hospital if you're expecting. I got such a great experience thanks to them. Once again, thank you Doctor and thank you Cloudnine!",

Mine was considered high risk pregnancy bcoz of bad obs history and from day 1 of my appt onwards, She gave special attention to me. She was always reachable on her mobile and supported me whenever I reached out to her. She took care of me like kohinoor diamond as She used to say. It was a Sunday and When I started getting contractions, She rushed to the hospital immediately after we rang up to her. It was emergency c sec and We were stunned looking at the way She operated . Whatta cool attitude!! I had met so many doctors in chennai and It's hard to find a Doctor with all the best qualities *** * **** *** *** ** *** **** ** **** She is such a lovely person, Very much patient friendly , Very Dedicated to her profession and above all Very caring person. I really miss her after my delivery and looking forward to meet her soon for my next pregnancy. Thank you doctor for everything. ",

She tried and pushed for a normal delivery till the last moment and succeeded. What is amazing is that she kept a cool head throughout, which made me and my husband also relaxed during labour. Would highly recommend her. ",

Such a thing is not very common in other OB/Gyn doctors. She answers all our queries and helps us with whatever pregnancy-related issues we may be facing. \n\nEspecially during my labour process, she was  so completely involved that it made me feel at ease and more confident to go through my labour process with her continuous help, advice and supervision even though my labour process was a bit prolonged. She's so experienced and ************* that it surely reduces your anxiety in the labour room knowing that you and your baby are in safe hands. Sometimes doctors can make you feel more scared, tensed and anxious during your labour and it really makes things worse for the patient who is already trying to cope up with the contractions but Dr. Nazira ma'am made sure I was comfortable throughout the process and she always listened patiently to what I had to say during that time. She made sure that I was taken care of properly during and after my labour process and didn't allow any unnecessary disturbances towards me since I had just gone through a lot of pain and exhaustion. \n\nEven after the delivery, she would visit me every day during my 3-day stay in the hospital to make sure I was healing well and ask me if I have any concerns whatsoever. Not all doctors are this kind and sweet while being so experienced *** ************* at the same time! I'm really so thankful to Dr. Nazira ma'am for taking care of me so well throughout my pregnancy and delivery and even post-delivery. It was truly a very good experience. I would highly recommend this doctor to anyone expecting. *** ** *** **** **** ***** ** **** ",

I'm a foreigner and I didn't know what to expect for gynecologists in India. I've heard that many doctors resort to C-section here even if the mother can delivery normally. Dr Nazira asked for my preferences for different things (type of delivery, if I wanted epidural or not, etc.) and respected my choices. She also monitored me closely towards the end to make sure the baby was OK as I was having some problems. Furthermore, she was present for the delivery although there was an Indian festival which she celebrated that day. I was very happy, relieved and grateful when the registra told me that Dr Nazira was on her way to the hospital as I was told by some other people who visited other gynecologists in another hospitals that their gyne didn't come at time of delivery. I definitely recommend Dr Nazira and Cloudnine Hospital if you're expecting. I got such a great experience thanks to them. Once again, thank you Doctor and thank you Cloudnine!",

Mine was considered high risk pregnancy bcoz of bad obs history and from day 1 of my appt onwards, She gave special attention to me. She was always reachable on her mobile and supported me whenever I reached out to her. She took care of me like kohinoor diamond as She used to say. It was a Sunday and When I started getting contractions, She rushed to the hospital immediately after we rang up to her. It was emergency c sec and We were stunned looking at the way She operated . Whatta cool attitude!! I had met so many doctors in chennai and It's hard to find a Doctor with all the best qualities *** * **** *** *** ** *** **** ** **** She is such a lovely person, Very much patient friendly , Very Dedicated to her profession and above all Very caring person. I really miss her after my delivery and looking forward to meet her soon for my next pregnancy. Thank you doctor for everything. ",

As the patient did not want to wait or comeback, gave prescription and called for review.  All answers cannot be obtained in the first visit  without further investigations.  500Rs is the standard consultation fee in any corporate hospital. In fact it is more. There are patients who do not like to accept that there is something wrong with their menstrual cycle and any missed periods should translate as pregnancy.  Apart from consultation for herself there was additional consultation free of cost for her friend.  Doctors are not business people we are treating patients and we need to do further investigations to know what  is happening to her hormonal status. Diagnosis cannot be obtained with a snap of the fingers.  All patients have to clearly understand this.  With more than30 yrs.of experience we have seen many such patients.  So I shall just let it pass. Thank you ",
