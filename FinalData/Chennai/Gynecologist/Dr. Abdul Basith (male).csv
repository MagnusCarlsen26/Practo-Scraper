came for a well woman check up at MMM in Feb 2019 and had a battery of tests done.

I was used to an elderly, **** ************* ****** ******. A young male? It took some encouragement from the nurses . They were full of praises for him. And so I went in.

 Dr. Abdul is not only obviously very qualified, but also knows how to break down complex info into very simple bits which anyone can understand. 
He explained my results. They had found an echogenic lesion in my endometrium. He explained very simply that I needed a hysterescopy and endometrial biopsy done and went ahead to explain what I needed to do, and where I needed to go. 

After the procedure was done, and results had come in, he gave my husband and I a very clear explanation of the results  and reassured us that it wasn't anything to worry about, but that all I needed was to do check ups. **** ******* ** ******* ** ** ******** ******** ** *** ******* ***** **** ****** ** ** ******* ** ** * *************
