"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I visit her for my pregnancy. To be very honest she is such a great human being with so much of patience. I should really say she is an unforgettable person in our life. I was a gestation diabetic patient and in the later pregnancy my baby weight got increased without taking insulin I have controlled the sugar level by diet. My water broke in the midnight and I called the doctor immediately and she told me to come to the hospital and she reached hospital before me (3 AM). My baby weight was 3.7 kg and it was a normal delivery. With this weight mostly the doctors will have only option as C- Section.

I would highly recommend her for any pregnant women as she don't prefer any unwanted medication. ",2023-10-18 14:33:18,False,True,Sudha,,,
