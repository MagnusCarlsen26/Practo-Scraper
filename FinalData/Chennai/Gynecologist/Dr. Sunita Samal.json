Since uterus fibroid size is 12 cm, she was suffering a lot of pain and bleeding, many days was nightmare for us and lost sleep.\n All doctors had insisted us to do open surgery because of bigger size and not having confident with laparoscope but Dr. Sunita Samal is the first doctor given confident that can be removed by laparoscopy.  So we fix the date on 21st August after the complete medical test.  Dr. Sunita Samal did surgery without any issue, am giving this review after 3 months now. my wife is completely fine and no other complication regarding her health. \nWe strongly recommending, Dr. Sunita Samal , she is excellent in profession and very friendly.",
