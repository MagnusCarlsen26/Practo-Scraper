Dear Florence Mam,
You just glow with your presence for us and I'm sure your nature in taking care of us might have not let you know the kind of impact you made on us with this journey to make it more smooth and memorable. We're overflowing with gratitude as we reflect on the incredible journey of bringing my daughter into the world, and it's impossible to express just how thankful I am for your exceptional care.

Your expertise transformed what could have been a daunting experience into a beautiful and natural miracle. Your unwavering support was our anchor, and your calm demeanor provided a sense of reassurance that made all the difference.

We used to talk about you in most of our conversations during our pregnancy as that's the kind of conversation and connect we have had with you.

Thank you, from the depths of my heart, for playing such a vital role in the arrival of our daughter.",2024-07-16 08:56:07,False,True,Deepa V,,,
