When I had high fever during the third corona wave at my 6th month of second pregnancy, even my gynecologist whom I visited till then was not ready to treat me, she suggested to go for corona ward. None of the hospitals were ready to give me the first aid atleast. But when I approached SM hospital, Dr.Suseela mam (30+ years of experience -mother of Dr.Anitha) gave me strength by gaining my confidence and suggested for some medications and the staffs there too helped alot. I got good opinion on SM hospital by then itself. Then I got to know much about Dr. Anitha mam during my 7th month of pregnancy and I was much curious to continue with her for my rest of my pregnancy journey. 
But it was a big challenge for me to convince my husband and my family. By god's grace, one by one coincidentally we started hearing something related to SM hospital and their way of treatment. Initially it was recommended by one of my friends. Then I enquired about the same with some of the people who delivered their babies over there and their own experience. Then I searched for Google reviews too. When my husband enquired about the hospital with his colleagues they also referred SM hospital unexpectedly with their past experience. So we strongly decided to go with Dr.Anitha Mam during my 7th month of pregnancy.
All set when we together visited Dr.Anitha mam for the first time. In one word we can describe her as 'saviour'. She is just polite, humble, soft spoken and she never recommend for unwanted scans and medications. She spends time with her patients and for our clarifications. She always says 'nothing to worry'. She does the delivery like a piece of cake. She and her staffs always prefer to normal delivery, They wait for it too (even after long tired day with work) even if you stress for C-sec. In my case, I was thejr third patient for the day of delivery(10.30pm). I personally know they came to the hospital by 5am and was waiting for my delivery till 11pm. They had to come again next day for a surgery at 5am..Though none of their labor ward staff show that tiredness in their face. They helped much for my comfort at the labor ward. They discharged me in 24hrs. I am a happy mom now with the blessed just born baby. Our family had a life time feel good memories with SM hospital and Dr. Anitha mam. I strongly recommend her for the safest delivery.
 Adding to it, It is not a money motive hospital, it is very very affordable at cost when compared to other hospitals in Chennai, patient friendly one. And my husband was permitted with me in the labor ward during the whole delivery process. I thank Sister Aleyamma who was with me throughout the process and cheered me till the last minute . Dr.Anitha Mam, you should live a long to bring many more beautiful souls to the world üíù. Love you Mam!!

I believe that these 9 months are very precious and one always wants them the best as anything can go wrong at any point. So it is very important at this time to have good support, especially on the healthcare front especially from the doctors.

She was always available for all my queries. The best thing about her is how she focuses on natural birth and waits till the end.

She also goes in for minimal medications and testing and believes that a natural process like pregnancy needs no intervention unless really required. We feel really grateful & are happy we chose SM Hospital for our baby‚Äôs arrival. 

My overall experience at the hospital has been awesome.
