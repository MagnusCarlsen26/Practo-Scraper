"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Srinivas Priya Hospital is an family run Maternity Hospital, by Mother (Rajeshwari Jayaraman) and Daughter (Raja Priya Ayyappan) both are very humble doctors and takes care of their patients well. it also has various other joint pain section manage by her son (Srinivasan).
It has very good Ambience and Nurses are cooperative and helpful, however has strict 1 attendee policy and management policy of not locking the doors from inside which makes our privacy in stake inspite paying huge amount for private rooms.
Cleanliness is their top priority i understand that but AC's and Restrooms amenities are not maintained well some are broken.
I don't know what's the role of HR (Vijaya Shankari - that's what night duty sister told who bought phone call of her) indulging in rude conversation with old age attendees looking after an Caesarean women. I beleive HR role is to look after staff payroll not poke their nose into others privacy. She is not fit to be in Hospitality industry or else hospital name might get spoil because of her behaviour. 5 Star was reduced to 4 star because of her rude behaviour and conversation with my mother-in-law.",2022-10-04 08:56:59,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Rajapriya Ayyappan is an amazing doctor, got to know through one of my close pharma friend. After a brief research we chose to consult her for maternity. Sheâ€™s clear, confident in her communication and easy to approach kind of doctor. She answers most of your questions with adequate amount of patience and has a good sense of humour to knock you down for super silly questions. My wife Narmadha had natural birth and we have a beautiful angel in our arms. I would always be thankful to such skilled doctors. 
Cons - Admin staff has to improve a lot in terms of their work, ability, speed and accuracy.  Pricing is decent and affordable.
