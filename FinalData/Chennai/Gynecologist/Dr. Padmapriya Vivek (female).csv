"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"It all started when I was 3 months pregnant in the US and decided to come to Chennai for Delivery. Many of my friends in the US told that I took a wrong decision travelling to India for delivery since the medical facilities are advanced and percentage of normal delivery in higher in the US than in India. But I believed in Dr.Padmapriya since I had a very good feedback from my friends who had consulted her for delivery. 

When I came and met her at Glenegals Global hospital, she welcomed with a smile and told me we should aim for normal delivery.She told me the Do's and Don'ts and I started to follow her instructions.Many say that she is very strict in maintaining our pregnancy weight, but trust me I think that is her secret of success.

Here comes my Labor War story.
Yes I have mentioned Labor war because my labor was a battle field between normal and C-section.My EDD was Sept 16th 2017 and I did not get pain till 13th Sept.As per her advice I was admitted for induced labor on 13th Sept 10.30 Am. I was induced with a Gel at 1 PM and we waited for 6 hours and did not get pain. Here is my list of complications - 
No Passive labor pain 
Baby's Weight 3.2 Kg at 38 weeks 
My Height Just 5 feet
Thick Cervix
Baby's Head did not descend down the Pelvic bone and was at brim till the last moment
I almost lost hope, but she did not. She gave me a dose of tablet for induced labor at 7 PM but still no pain. At 11.45 PM, I had small leak of fluid.Duty doctors informed her and she told not to worry and I still had 24hrs of waiting time. 
Finally at 11 AM next day 14th Sept, I was induced with another dose and she told we will wait till 5 PM else I had to deliver through C-section since I was leaking fluid.

At that point I literally cried. I could feel her being upset and she asked me to be bold.Duty doctors were monitoring me carefully and my husband was beside me with full support.Since my delivery could anytime be C-section,I was given only liquid food from morning. So I started loosing strength physically and mentally. Thankfully I started getting action labor pain from 12 PM and it went intense around 4 PM. I literally begged for Epidural since I could not bear the pain. But I did not reach the stage at which Epidural should be given. Finally at 7 PM I was given Epidural and pain was bearable. I was shifted to labor room and duty doctors advised me to push to check if my baby can descend through the pelvic bone. 

Padmapriya mam come around 7.30 and said still baby head is at brim. They encouraged me to push and with 1 hour of pushing and her patience I delivered our baby princess normally at 8.52 PM.

She is a busy lady as she works round the clock but you can always share your concerns with her anytime via calls, whatsapp or meeting her in person. Late nights when I was in need she was availble on calls. 
She prefers normal delivery and also encourages the patients. If you have a strong will and trust in you, I would always prefer you to consult Dr Padma as I count on my experience with her.

I got to know her through my prenatal Mentor. When I asked my mentor for a Good Gyn.She told I will blindly suggest Dr. Padma Priya because she is one among the few Doctors who aims for Natural Delivery for her patients.

I remember the first day I met her.She welcomed me with her beautiful smile and told me, darling we are aiming for a Natural Delivery.She explained me Do's and Dont's during pregnancy and gave me advise on our every visit.

I never knew that she is a famous Doctor until my wats app group friends told me .She has worked for 96 hours During the chennai Flood time and was awarded by Vijay Tv but she never showed off that she is such a famous Doctor.Very Down to earth personality. I was totally impressed with her Dedication towards her profession.Even during vardha cyclone she stayed in hospital for 3 days to support her patience.

Like others we too faced difficulty in waiting in queue to meet her.We addressed this issue to her. From the next visit i saw a secretary was appointed and the Queue was managed well.

18th December 2016( Sunday ) I had a Membrane Rupture I called her and informed about it but unfortunately she was in Bangalore to attend a conference.But she canceled her evening program and came all the way from Bangalore to treat me.

She told me to get admitted and she made sure that Duty Dr and Nurses addressed me during her absence.Thanks to Dr. Bhargavi, Dr. Rajsri Nurse Elizabeth ,Eashwari who took care of me during her absence.

I was so happy when I saw Dr.Padma Priya mam :) .She was very encouraging during my Labor *** *** ******* ***** ********* ** **** **** ** **** ******** **** ******** **********

It was a big hurdle where we have crossed in our life. Initially we were looking for a good gynaecology doctor in chennai. One of my neighbour has shared her experience on delivery with Dr Padma Priya. Based on her feedback we have started to see her.

While entering in her room.She use do a blushing smile and i never seen a restless on her face.She always start to call a patient with an energetic sound.In start of my caring days, i had to put up a weight gain to increase my baby weight.In every check up she use to monitor and provide a healthly advise to gain weight. And always she say "" dont worry,  you will get a normal delivery"". I love her passion towards showing in her profession.

During delivery,  - suddenly i had a water leakage and got fear whether baby wouldve drink water at inside. Rushed up to the hospital and admitted  immediately. She has advised dont worry will do a normal delivery. Since it was evening she has to wait till midnight @12. I didn't get much pain and she addressed to night doctors. At early morning i got a severe pain and she run up quickly to deliver my baby. She never worried about sleepless night. Really she s gifted by god.Always god with her to do a wonderful service to the patient. At last, she never think, it is her patient, her thought is like a sister to take care. Yes, she did...

Hi All. We have been gifted with Baby Boy on 28/09/2016 @ Appolo Cradle, Karapakkam under the guidance of Dr Padmapriya Vivek (gynaecologist). Feeling blessed to share the experience I had during my first pregnancy.
Before I write the review, special thanks to Dr Padmapriya for her guidance and support.
I chose to consult Dr Padmapriya Vivek for my Pregnancy Check-up in Apollo Cradle Karapakkam after getting positive reviews from many of my friends and witnessing an overwhelming positive reviews in various websites online. Now I can safely vouch that all positive reviews are absolutely true.
Still I vividly remember the 1st day when I went to her for consultation. She is very soft spoken and generates very positive vibes. Her consultation room is full of flowers, good wishes messages and card (which I think she thoroughly deserves). She was very friendly to approach throughout the monthly check-ups. Just like a mentor she will examine you thoroughly and when required she used to warn mainly not to get overweight by eating junk foods. She insists on to follow a strict diet which I believe helps for a normal delivery. She prescribed the required exercise to stay fit as well. To put it simple she will take you to your comfort level and guide you through out these 9 months. With God’s grace and with her guidance I delivered a healthy baby through Normal delivery.
Thanks to all the Supporting staff who have been so kind and humble throughout this journey. I would strongly recommend the Doctor and Hospital to all the ladies looking out for the best option.

She is a busy lady as she works round the clock but you can always share your concerns with her anytime via calls, whatsapp or meeting her in person. Late nights when I was in need she was availble on calls. 
She prefers normal delivery and also encourages the patients. If you have a strong will and trust in you, I would always prefer you to consult Dr Padma as I count on my experience with her. Thank you Dr. PADMAPRIYA once again for all your support and positivity that made me deliver a healthy Baby.  Love you and wishing you all the best for your continued good service.

I got to know her through my prenatal Mentor. When I asked my mentor for a Good Gyn.She told I will blindly suggest Dr. Padma Priya because she is one among the few Doctors who aims for Natural Delivery for her patients.

I remember the first day I met her.She welcomed me with her beautiful smile and told me, darling we are aiming for a Natural Delivery.She explained me Do's and Dont's during pregnancy and gave me advise on our every visit.

I never knew that she is a famous Doctor until my wats app group friends told me .She has worked for 96 hours During the chennai Flood time and was awarded by Vijay Tv but she never showed off that she is such a famous Doctor.Very Down to earth personality. I was totally impressed with her Dedication towards her profession.Even during vardha cyclone she stayed in hospital for 3 days to support her patience.

Like others we too faced difficulty in waiting in queue to meet her.We addressed this issue to her. From the next visit i saw a secretary was appointed and the Queue was managed well.

18th December 2016( Sunday ) I had a Membrane Rupture I called her and informed about it but unfortunately she was in Bangalore to attend a conference.But she canceled her evening program and came all the way from Bangalore to treat me.

She told me to get admitted and she made sure that Duty Dr and Nurses addressed me during her absence.Thanks to Dr. Bhargavi, Dr. Rajsri Nurse Elizabeth ,Eashwari who took care of me during her absence.

It was a big hurdle where we have crossed in our life. Initially we were looking for a good gynaecology doctor in chennai. One of my neighbour has shared her experience on delivery with Dr Padma Priya. Based on her feedback we have started to see her.

While entering in her room.She use do a blushing smile and i never seen a restless on her face.She always start to call a patient with an energetic sound.In start of my caring days, i had to put up a weight gain to increase my baby weight.In every check up she use to monitor and provide a healthly advise to gain weight. And always she say "" dont worry,  you will get a normal delivery"". I love her passion towards showing in her profession.

During delivery,  - suddenly i had a water leakage and got fear whether baby wouldve drink water at inside. Rushed up to the hospital and admitted  immediately. She has advised dont worry will do a normal delivery. Since it was evening she has to wait till midnight @12. I didn't get much pain and she addressed to night doctors. At early morning i got a severe pain and she run up quickly to deliver my baby. She never worried about sleepless night. Really she s gifted by god.Always god with her to do a wonderful service to the patient. At last, she never think, it is her patient, her thought is like a sister to take care. Yes, she did...

Hi All. We have been gifted with Baby Boy on 28/09/2016 @ Appolo Cradle, Karapakkam under the guidance of Dr Padmapriya Vivek (gynaecologist). Feeling blessed to share the experience I had during my first pregnancy.
Before I write the review, special thanks to Dr Padmapriya for her guidance and support.
I chose to consult Dr Padmapriya Vivek for my Pregnancy Check-up in Apollo Cradle Karapakkam after getting positive reviews from many of my friends and witnessing an overwhelming positive reviews in various websites online. Now I can safely vouch that all positive reviews are absolutely true.
Still I vividly remember the 1st day when I went to her for consultation. She is very soft spoken and generates very positive vibes. Her consultation room is full of flowers, good wishes messages and card (which I think she thoroughly deserves). She was very friendly to approach throughout the monthly check-ups. Just like a mentor she will examine you thoroughly and when required she used to warn mainly not to get overweight by eating junk foods. She insists on to follow a strict diet which I believe helps for a normal delivery. She prescribed the required exercise to stay fit as well. To put it simple she will take you to your comfort level and guide you through out these 9 months. With God’s grace and with her guidance I delivered a healthy baby through Normal delivery.
Thanks to all the Supporting staff who have been so kind and humble throughout this journey. I would strongly recommend the Doctor and Hospital to all the ladies looking out for the best option.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"My name is Anbarasi Prem. I want share my feedback about my pregnancy checkups with Dr.PadmaPriya. I am glad to share my experience so others can benefit through it. Firstly I am very glad that I'm gonna write a feedback about Dr.Padma Priya. After my pregnancy was confirmed we went to Apollo cradle in OMR and asked for Dr.Padma Priya as my friend had recommended that she is a very good doctor for pregnancy check up. But we were told that she had already quit and joined somewhere else. We were suggested to check with the available pregnancy doctors in Apollo. But we questioned in which hospital she has joined and after knowing that we went to Global Hospital where she is the HOD for that department. I strongly believe that God has been always guiding us in every action we took which is applicable even in this decision of choosing the doctor. Our first consultation with Dr.Padma Priya has gave us the confident that we are at the right place and with the right doctor. As we all know when our parents gave birth for us, normal delivery was very common and most probably they were not even aware that there was a procedure by the name C-section. In the present day world where money matters the most in all hospitals to run their hospitals, C-section delivery has become common than the normal delivery. The words which we heard from Dr. PadmaPriya during our first consultation was ""We only try for Normal Delivery"".  Those were the best words a pregnant woman can expect from a doctor. For every time we consulted her all those months we were given all the necessary information like what will happen to the baby and for me that month and what changes and challenges that I might face during that month. So she prepared me mentally and physically well in advance from those pregnancy related events I had witnessed. I could say that there was nothing left which she might have missed to tell a pregnant lady who regularly consults her. You can feel a positive vibe penetrates you whenever you have a word with her because she isn't doing any magic on you but her words are magical which gives you the strength and hope. It continued even on the day I got admitted in the hospital. She infuses the strength that we set our mind for normal delivery. Unbelievably when I was in the delivery ward fighting with the pain I never gave up and I tried with all my force and ability. Finally , the sweetest noise I heard in the delivery ward as a result of all my struggles that i went through right from the day of my pregnancy began till the day I delivered my baby was the cry of my baby. Thank God. With His blessings * *** *** **** ****** *** ****** ******** ** *** ***** Ever since I got admitted for delivery till I delivered my baby all the ladies who gave birth there were all normal delivery. You will not hear this from most of your friends or relatives except for a person who consulted with her. To stay healthy even after delivery you only need a normal delivery and that is possible only with Dr.Padma Priya. Delivering a baby is like coming back to life which can happen in presence of God. My God helped me cross this divine journey of carrying a baby to giving birth through Dr.PadmaPriya.

First off, massive respect to all mothers!

I met Dr. Padmapriya in my 36th week of gestation (was in Bangalore initially). I was waiting for my turn of consultation, when she walked out of her room in a hurry. But she was observant enough to realize that it was the first time she saw me around, and she stopped by me to ask if I was waiting to see her. When I said yes, she asked for a quick excuse and said that she'll be back in sometime. 
Now, how many doctors are as down to earth as this?! 
When she returned, I had a long list of questions and a birth plan to be discussed. She spent around 20 minutes, discussing each and every point in good detail. 
Pretty much implies that she treats her patients with patience!
The 38th week scan showed a 3.2 kg fetus. She subtly asked me to follow a strict diet so that the chances of an NVD are not meagre. 
She is one doc who alerts her patients without alarming them. 
Everytime, I walked into her room, she would greet me with a 'Come in sweetheart'. I never felt frightened to meet her. She makes sure that her patients feel good about themselves.
On my D day, I was induced. 15 hours afterwards, I was dilated to 8 cm but the fetus was still at station 1. At this stage, NVD is difficult and so she was preparing us for a C Sec. However, she wanted to wait for another hour. She tied a belt across the top of my tummy and asked me to push during contractions. She cancelled her OP  during the final nail-biting hour and constantly checked my status.  Eventually, she helped me deliver a 4.5 kg baby doll, 'NORMALLY'. I don't think that is normal. 

To simply put it, if you want a good experience with a gynec (who opts for NVD herself), I would recommend Dr.Padmapriya Vivek.

From being an unsure couple to proud parents, we have had one super roller-coaster ride. We had come to you with issues which are perhaps not widely heard of. But for the reluctant us, we found a confident you. From that day to the day today, we cannot thank our stars enough that we came to you.

Being qualified as a doctor on paper is one, but being so deeply involved with your work and the level of commitment that you have given for us to experience puts you in an absolutely different pedestal.

We had presumed that the journey to becoming parents would be tough, but you paved our way throughout. From consultations, to discussions about work, to advises, you have been much more than a doctor for us. You are a great human being. We could see the soft side of you helping the people in need and a stronger side of you demanding quality work from your team. This only enhanced our confidence that we are in safe hands.

We see you working long hours and it is great to see you go that extra mile for your patients. We see you as one of the greatest doctors that this country has ever produced, and perhaps some day you would be honored in an appropriate national forum for your great work and we would be proud of the fact that we were among your many patients.

There hasn’t been one like you, there won’t be any in the future. We wish you the very best of success, health, wealth and peace!

I had few gynec related health issues since then and it made my life much harder to cope with. We decided to give ourselves some time to come out of all these, return to India and try being at home.

I have searched for a good gynecologist and have come across Dr.Padma Priya mam through word of mouth and online.
The decision to meet her could be rated as one of the best decisions we've ever made in our lives.
We explained everything and as usual with her charming and encouraging smile she guided us on what's next.

My consulting cycle with her started somewhere around May 2016 and by October 2016 we had the best news - that I'm pregnant !!
We didn't want to loose this and were very cautious in every phase throughout the pregnancy.

She was constantly encouraging during all checkups that I will definitely have normal delivery. During my last phase of labor, I myself wanted to go for C-section as I couldn't bear the pain but she dint agree to it, she encouraged me saying I was almost there and the baby’s head is visible. She kept saying when I can deliver naturally why should I go for C section. Also my baby had passed motion and the baby’s heart beat was fluctuating. She closely monitored the heart beat and was never convinced to go for a c section. Had it been any other doctor, they would have immediately operated me. But she along with her team kept motivating me till the last minute though I was begging for a C section. And finally she did it. I delivered my baby girl normally after all the struggle. She is very confident in her work and knows what is best for the patient. 
Just go by her instructions and I am sure you will have a very smooth delivery.

I am a working woman with frequent travel requirements. My husband is in the armed forces and I stayed alone throughout my pregnancy in Chennai. Being a first time mother, I had many apprehensions and thanks to ma'am, I worked till the day I delivered, traveled almost every month, did not gain any additional weight and delivered without any fear or tear. 

Dr Padmapriya will guide you to a tee regarding your diet, exercise, emotional health and overall well being. I developed hypertension during my last trimester and yet delivered normally in the 37th week. She also took additional care, as I would be alone at home, most of times. 

What sets her apart is her positive counselling and vibrant infectious energy throughout the birthing journey. 

I definitely feel blessed and grateful to have found her. She was like my elder sister, who comforted me like a mother and treated me like a highly dedicated professional doctor. Super thankful to her for my healthy little daughter and the countless hugs.

Dr. Padma priya was a wonderful guide for me through out my pregnancy journey.

I would definitely recommend anybody looking for a normal delivery to go with Dr. Padmapriya. One other very important thing is, she is always very approachable and available via whatsapp.

As all other couple, we also had lots of preoccupied things about doctors and C-sections. Every Time, we expressed our sense of fear by our doubts. During the last weeks it was very clear to the doctor that we had no belief in her. 
At this point many doctors would have directly said to consult the one whom you believe. But being so famous and with whole lot of patients waiting outside, She explained things in the most Humblest way possible. She literally put herself in our shoes.

One of my colleague highly recommended Dr Padmapriya.  I was surprised to learn she had a normal delivery, frankly speaking none of my friends had normal delivery. 
Padmapriya ma'am is very warm, vivacious and highly committed doctor. She suggests only natural things no extra medication and encourages you to maintain a regular lifestyle. Very particular about weight gain and exercise ( walking, squatting). 
Coming to my delivery part.... She had asked me to check the labor ward before hand so in case of emergency we were prepared. When my pain started she asked me to come. The whole staff of labor ward are wonderful be the doctors,  nurses or even the helping lady. I progressed very well through my labor and I requested for epidural. Everything went smoothly but after hours of pushing the baby just wouldn't come down. That's when Padmapriya ma'am encouraged me that I could still have a normal delivery even though I was so tired and given up and was begging for a c section.  That's when she said she will give a one last try and they did a fundal delivery accompanied by vaccum and I had my beautiful baby boy. I was later informed that my baby's head was turned towards pelvis and the cord was tied around the neck and it was pretty critical. But they all kept their cool and never panicked nor did she give up on normal delivery.  I am sure be it any one else I would have had a c section. 
She is one of the doctor's who encourages husband's to also be part of this beautiful journey so that they can be with you during delivery. The whole staff of the labor ward are exceptional. 
Gleneagles has good facilities post delivery which I have to mention. We had a lactation consultant visit to teach me the correct method of breast-feeding (posture,  holding the baby) which is very much needed for new moms and also a dietitian to chart our daily meals.

After preterm first delivery @ 31 weeks, I was in dilemma whether to go with second baby. After lots of discussion with my family members & reading lots of reviews about gyne doctor’s feedback, we have chosen Dr PPV as my gynecologist. 
During my first pregnancy I gone through various health complication like bleeding from third to fifth month so was in complete bed rest, diagnosed with gestational diabetes and was under insulin medication & urinary infection which were untreated till last weeks of first pregnancy. So it lead to premature labour and we suffered lot to bring up the first baby during first year since my delivery. Fortunately by god’s grace my labour ended with normal vaginal delivery.
For second pregnancy as my colleague suggested I visited Dr PPV. From Day 1 onwards she was very much cautious about my first preterm delivery and giving me the guidance & confidence to deliver full term baby & assured for normal vaginal delivery which gave me confident & mental support. She helped me to get in touch with dietician from first trimester onwards & I was under GDM for the entire tenure without insulin. Also I was diagnosed with urinary infection in first trimester and she got it treated immediately with necessary medications.  Also when I was around 31 weeks, she gave me an injection for babies lungs maturity, she suggested this could help to avoid any respiratory complication considering my preterm history.	 She tried hard to push my pregnancy to 38 weeks as I was under GDM.
Dr PPV gave me confidence @ the end of 34 weeks that we reached safe period and assured me that I will deliver safe and healthy baby.
Finally I got my labour pain all of sudden @ 35 weeks and I was hurried to labour ward. With support from Dr PPV and her team, I delivered boy baby through normal vaginal delivery. 
She is indeed a truly blessed Doctor and I’m also blessed to be in the right hands. We see you working long hours and it is great to see you go that extra mile for your patients.

      Our search for a good obstetrician across our medical circles ended with the repeated reference of her name as a trustworthy Doctor from her earlier stint to her current availability at Global Gleneagles.
       We walked in to her chamber on the appointed day expecting to find a senior person in the consultants chair only to find a young,fresh looking at 8 pm,live,bubbling with energy,warm, confident and smiling Doctor.Her antenatal care was meticulous and her front office para medical and receptionists made our visits comfortable.What amazed us was her willingness to address all our queries and worries without rushing us.
       Then the D day arrived and my daughter was admitted to the delivery ward and there too her pro‐ fessional and paramedical team exuded the same level of profeesional excellence.In the 24 hours that ended with a 2.5 kg normally delivered baby we encountered reduced level of water(Oligohydramnios),minimally dilated Cervix(Os),mild foetal distress,membrane rupture,maternal and attenders stress,all relative indic‐ ations for a caesarean section.But the team persisted and succeeded in their effort to give a normal delivery.
     Then during the post natal period again Madam and team along with the paediatrics team
    Madam and team along with the paediatrics team took good care of the mother and baby from healing, feeding, immunisation and friendly counselling.

I went regular check up at my 36th week on Feb 27.Dr Padmapriya mam advised me to remove my cervical encirclage ( I got conceived with twins,had stitches)..after removal we got to know that I got dilated 2 cm without pain.I was kept observation for 4 hours but I didn't get pain. Mam asked me to Stay near by and come on next day.We stayed in global accommodation.On next day while checking we came to know I got dilated 4 cm with out pain.The same thing happened for next two days I got 5 cm dilated without pain and returned accommodation. On March 2nd,around 8.15 pm my water discharge started..we run to labor ward immediately. I got 6 cm dilated. From 8.45 around my contraction started.
I started breathing exercises.At around 9.45 heavy pain started .As it is twins and mam trying to deliver it naturally everyone was very eagerly looking on my case. At last i delivered my first baby girl at 10.19pm.here the interesting twist happened ,my second baby changed from head down to transverse.  Entire Doctor team was much interested to see what going to happen next .Mam discussed with me and husband as baby turned we have to go for c section and started arrangements. I was little worried because I wanted to deliver my baby  naturally. But I said to myself  whatever happens let them happen now I am going to see my baby soon.At the same time Padmapriya mam tried to change my baby's position to head down externally, with her magical hands and gods grace she moved my baby's head to down .with her's only efforts My baby's position again came to cephalic and entire Doctors Team encouraged me to deliver normally. At 11.01pm I delivered my second baby girl naturally.

Our family will never forget Padmapriya mam because  she said when both babies are head down we will go for normal delivery from the beginning and she achieved it in my case by doing external cephalic version at last minute.

As we met her she welcomed us with all the smile and patiently listened to our concerns. She then asked me go through few tests. An HSG showed my tubes were open, no blockages. Apparently, the problem was the hormonal imbalance which had to be treated. Priya mam was always positive and assured me that I can get conceived very soon. The only key is to have patience and staying positive.
I visited her for follicular scan and she closely monitored the growth of the egg and induced ovulation. Some of my relatives even suggested that I go for IVF else it would be too late. But Priya mam was strongly against it in my case coz she believed if we are relaxed and patient this will surely workout without even having to go through IVF. This is exactly what I followed and after 8 months of treatment I was very happy to see the result – ohh yes!! I could see the 2 dark lines in the pregnancy test kit :)  
So guys, from my experience I would suggest you all please don’t be in hurry and desperate to see the results immediately as it will not help us in anyway. Please have patience, relaxed and hope in Priya mam. *** ** *** **** ** **** *** :)

Because of her only, We got our little angel with Normal Delivery.

Actually My wife only suggested her to get the treatment for Pregnancy since my wife's colleagues delivered baby with normal delivery by this doctor.

Initially we thought that we would admit for labor at our native place. Because most of my friends who were treated at chennai, delivered baby with C-section. Even our family too scared about that.
 But after consulting with this doctor, we made sure to admit for labor with Dr.Padmapriya only.

She is so friendly and explains the status throughout our course. She is always telling that they will do only normal delivery. She is so strict in diet & Weight gaining. She guides very well what to eat.

After 39 weeks, She asked us to admit before three days of our due. Fortunately Pain came on that day of admission itself naturally. It dilated  very fast and everyone thought that it would be delivered on that day itself. But it didn't happen on that day.
So, they induced  to get pain. Around 5.24 PM , my wife delivered Baby girl with natural delivery. During labor , my wife didn't bear the pain and lost hope.
still doctor and her team  did that. I don't think no doctors will wait more than one day for natural delivery.

IF ANYONE WANTS TO GET THEIR BABY  THROUGH NORMAL DELIVERY, SHE IS THE ONE  *** ****.

And She suggested Motherhood Pregnancy course by Ananthi where we could get a lot of knowledge and labor actions. Those are invaluable during labor.
They guides when to come to hospital, how to act during labor & breathing practices etc. It makes us to be aware and strong mentally.

We are always very grateful for her treatment.

Thanks A Lot once again DR. PadmaPriya Vivek.

She is one of the few doctors who does not give unnecessary medicines or tests and would let things happen naturally. 


She relies on her experience and knowledge rather than checking things now and then with machines.

Most importantly she knows how to take care of pregnant women.

Dr.padma priya made me believe that I can deliver normally. She encouraged me to do simple excercises and walking which helped me a lot during labor. It is because of her constant assurance that I was very confident and completely trusted her and had normal delivery. 

After I delivered my baby, she told me that the baby had a  loop around his neck. Usually lots of other hospitals make this a complicated issue.Also my baby weight is 3.5 kg during delivery. Dr.padma priya handled it efficiently and did not panic me when I was pushing my baby out.

Tip - As you prepare for the delivery, just follow what the doctor recommends (diet, exercise.etc) even if it is different (may be counterintuitive sometimes) from what your grand mom/ mom/ sister/ your own experience says. It is only to lead you to the most beautiful moment of your life in the least painful manner.
