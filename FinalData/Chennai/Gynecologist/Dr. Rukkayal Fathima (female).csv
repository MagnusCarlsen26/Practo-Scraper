She will Genuinely try her best for Normal Delivery, except some critical condition if any.

Also She is Friendly and skilled on her profession.

up to 5th month i had visited two different doctors in Laxmi Maternity and AMS Hospital at adyar. In both the places i am not satisfied with doctors care and treatment.

After 5 th month only we found Dr. Rukkayal through google and practo reviews and visited for pregnancy checkup.

At very first we asked some clarifications before consulting, she is polite and answered for all our queries clearly. 

Then only we decided to continue for check-up further. Before met her (upto 5 months) , I was confused and tensed whether i am visiting the correct doctor

to my wife. After visiting her, I was completely Free from pressure and believed her 100%. 

She will explain the things clearly and guide you for Normal delivery always. My wife also Delivered the baby in Normal.

Also very reasonable fees for checkup at Mylapore Golden Clinic.
