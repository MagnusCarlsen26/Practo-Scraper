None,None,0,0,YES,"Exceptional Experience at Promed Hospital - Heartfelt Recommendation for Dr. Arun Kalyanasundaram

I am writing to share an experience that has left me truly speechless and has given our family renewed faith in the medical profession. My family and I recently had the privilege of being treated at Promed Hospital, and I wholeheartedly recommend this hospital to anyone facing heart ailments.

In particular, I insist that any patient with a heart ailment should seek the expertise of Dr. Arun Kalyanasundaram. He is undoubtedly a subject matter expert and possesses an unparalleled depth of knowledge in his field. Not only does he have an excellent grasp of his subject matter, but he also ensures that his patients are thoroughly educated about their entire medical journey. Dr. Arun takes the time to consult with patients, actively seeking their views and ensuring they are comfortable throughout the process.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Dr. Arun is his friendly and approachable demeanor. He has the extraordinary ability to make the daunting medical procedures feel like a walk in the park. During my time at the hospital, I took a closer look at his profile and discovered his unwavering commitment to educating the masses on heart health, which is truly commendable. I also found him on Instagram, where he goes by the handle ""Heart of Living,"" a platform that exemplifies his dedication to spreading awareness and knowledge.

It is worth noting that Dr. Arun's influence extends beyond himself. He has impeccably trained his team to be just as caring and compassionate as he is, providing immense comfort to the patients they attend to. Special commendations go to Doctor Akinchan, Doctor Naseer, and all the instrumental members who contributed to the success of our surgery.

As a family, we cannot express enough gratitude to Dr. Arun Kalyanasundaram and his team. We believe that they are the go-to choice for anyone seeking treatment for heart ailments. Their expertise, compassion, and dedication have made a profound impact on us, and we will forever be grateful for their care.

Lastly, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Dr. T. S. Subramanuim for connecting us with Dr. Arun. Your support and guidance have been invaluable to us.

None,None,0,0,YES,I'm so happy with the treatment. Kudos to Dr. Arun and his team. They've done an excellent job. I recently underwent Angiogram. It revealed extensive three vessel disease with 100% blockage in Right side. My primary Cardiologist suggested Early open heart surgery. Then I came to know about Dr. Arun thru my friends. Dr. Arun Kalyanasundaram reviewed my Angiogram and he has treated all blockages with the treatment of Angioplasty. I got discharged after 3 days. Now I'm able toperform my daily activities without any discomfort. Many Thanks to Dr. Arun and his Team.,2022-08-29 15:45:50,False,True,Verified Patient,Thank you for your  valuable feedback,2022-08-30T09:50:50+0000,Promed Hospital
