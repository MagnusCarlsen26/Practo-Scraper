I had to get on a flight not knowing if I would see my mother in the morning, her condition was that serious. But thanks to Dr. Vignesh who literally saved her life and brought her back to us. His care and attention to detail for the patiant is exemplary. Dr. Vignesh goes above and beyond the normal bed side manor, he is kind and understanding with both the patient as well as the family and meticulous in answering all questions and in explaining treatments, options and outcomes. He was never rushed with us but was so calm and patiant in replying to all queries on medication and life style changes and whatever other things we asked him. Truly and exceptional, life saving doctor. We are lucky to have him as my mother's cardiologist",

                "review_text": "My father,Mr. Rajasekaran,  complained of chest pains on 4th February 2021 and compliance with his persistent symptoms; we took him to MIOT Hospital. He was diagnosed with Acute Inferior Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction.  We were consulted by Dr Vignesh, who explained to us clearly, the need for emergency revascularization by primary PCI and following that, a successful coronary angiogram was performed. Dr Vignesh was patient and kind in helping us understand the severity of the situation so that we could understand and gave us his best medical advice to take care of my father's health. We are indeed lucky and grateful enough to be in touch and to get treated by a sincere and diligent doctor who ensures my father's health is as best as it can be.",

I want to express my deep gratitude and appreciation of the highly professional and efficient medical service provided by the hospital.  My special thanks and appreciation to Dr. T. Vignesh of the Cardiology Department for not only giving a very prompt and good medical care, but also going to lengths in explaining the various aspects and subtleties of the malady and the treatment. Some of my friends from the medical fraternity elsewhere remarked after seeing the discharge summary and other reports that it was the best medical care I could have got anywhere and were particularly appreciative of Dr. Vignesh\u2019s skill and understanding. My good wishes to the doctors and staff of the hospital. - Anoop Jaiswal, IPS (DGP-retd.), Chennai.",
