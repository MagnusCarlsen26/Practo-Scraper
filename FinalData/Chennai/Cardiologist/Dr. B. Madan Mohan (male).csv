"Doctor friendliness,","Hypertension,",0,0,YES,"I had been to the clinic to consult with Dr Madan for my wife's hypertension. Dr Madan is a ******** professional and it is a pleasure to consult him. Our last visit was on 19Apr2017.

However my experience with his front office  / lab staff has been disappointing.
1) The front office staff did not give receipt for the consultation fee and asked me to come to the clinic at a later date for the receipt
2) The person who collected the blood sample was downright rude and unprofessional. He did not give the receipt. He was arrogant to ask us to visit the clinic after a few days for the receipt. He had promised that the report would be emailed - which was never done. 
I dropped by the clinic again on 25Apr to collect the report - he took a long time to pull out the report and again refused to give the receipt. He asked me to visit the clinic again on 28Apr for the receipt. 

A) Please AVOID doing any tests at this clinic. 
B) Please pay the Consultation fee only once the receipt is generated - otherwise they will make you run around.
