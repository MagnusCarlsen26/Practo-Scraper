I was a worried man with a lot of things specifically when it comes to my health and well-being. I am generally anxious and scared of hospitals and medical tests. When I get anxious or think of any negative situations, my heart starts racing and I end up with slight head-aches and pressure/tightness in my chest. This made me worry a lot given the type of personality I am. I also have white coat BP. With all these going on in my life, I was always hesitant to go to a doctor. But I started worrying a lot in the recent weeks and hence finally made up my mind and wanted to consult Dr. Harikrishnan P after reading some good reviews about him. I must say..it was a true blessing meeting this gentleman. Today I came out of the hospital with a perfectly fit man.  After hearing my problems, he demonstrated to me how breathing helps bring down my pulse rate. My first pulse reading was way too more :). He said I am completely fine and I just need some regular exercise. When I asked him for more he said that\u2019s all (no meds!) but for my benefit, he advised me to go for a heart package. I completed all the tests and the results are perfectly fine. I went back to him with the reports. He only said \u201cDint I tell you you are perfectly fine\u201d. He created a positive and beautiful impact on my life. Because now I am feeling like I am completely a new man with no such worries any more.  The best doctor I have ever met!",

We booked an appointment and had a consultation with him. His approach was friendly with us and he explained  the diagnosis procedure for cardiac problem in a layman's view. Before diagnosis, he recommended my father for blood test and covid test. Unfortunately, my father got positive for asymptomatic covid. Immediately we consulted him to know what can be done further. He was kind enough to reply us through whatsapp whenever we messaged him without time restrictions. He suggested to get advise from Apollo fever clinic. As per his advice, we consulted the clinic and underwent CT scan and they advised for home quarantine. Since it was asymptomatic, everything went smoothly. After 14 days of home isolation, my father became covid negative. With no further delay we contacted Dr.Harikrishnan. He suggested for immediate angiogram procedure in Apollo hospital, vanagaram.  My father was diagnosed with nearly 10 blocks in the coronary artery and the doctor suggested immediate surgery and refered a surgeon in the same hospital. The surgery was successful and my father's health recovered well. We are having regular check up with Dr. Harikrishnan.  Thanks a lot for his continuous support during our critical time.  ",

But the way Dr. Harikrishnan explained me about my health condition and way to look forward, half of my worries disappeared. I started believing in me, which was more than any medication. Dr. Harikrishnan spends enough time to his patients, listen their silly question and answers them politely and happily. He is always very co-operative, helpful, joyful and his such supportive quality helped me in building my self-confidence. He not only prescribes medication for us, but also encourage us to follow a healthy lifestyle, physical exercise.\nNow I am more confident and in good health, active person and all credit goes to Dr. Harikrishnan.  I truly respect him for his passion toward his profession\nI have visited him for my father & uncle. My father & uncle are also very much impressed with his treatment, diagnosis, medication & to the point treatment. \nI am very thankful to him for his treatment, motivation, guidance.\n",

Way back in 2013, when my mother, aged 70, was rushed to Apollo, Greams Road, Chennai, to our good fortune, my mother was put in the hands of Dr. Hari. That day after having her vitals stabilised, my mother was advised to undergo open heart surgery for her triple vessel disease as per family member's discretion. No wonder, as a layman and with all my apprehensions, I was in a dilemma whether to go ahead with her surgery or not. What Dr.Hari told me at that point of time didn't make me think twice to make a decision. Dr.Hari just told me \"If it were my mother, I would want her in the operation theatre immediately, to give the best chance for her survival\".  My mother was operated on as per Dr.Hari's advice and guidance and the rest is history. Till date, touch wood, my mother is doing good. As I told, despite his high end degrees in the field of medicine and despite all his experience as a doctor, it is that 'warm humanly touch' which Dr.Hari adds while treating his patients sets him apart. Sometimes I even meet doctor Hari with the excuse of getting my parents checked up. He is such a wonderful doctor-friend. I wish doctor Hari all the very best to reach greater heights in his career.

But once the frequency of occurence went up, We consulted Dr. Harikrishnan for treatment. Not to exaggerate but he was the most professional and patient friendly doctor I've ever met. He was patient enough to hear the issue and diagnose with precision and explain it to us in detail without panicking anyone. We were so impressed by his approach that my mom who had her apprehension to proceed with surgery all these days agreed to it immediately. Now my mom is absolutely fine and we are ever grateful to Dr. Harikrishnan for completely curing my Mom. ",

And when a doctor is warm and friendly, you forget your worries momentarily and are immediately made to feel at ease. Doctor Harikrishnan is one such divine doctor. I was worried about chest pains that I'd been feeling, he was sooooo attentive and his expertise spoke for itself. He didn't suggest unnecessary tests. Just to make sure everything was okay, he suggested only an Echo and a Treadmill Test. And as he'd said, the results were normal and he attributed the pains to gastric issues that had cropped up due to some strong medicines I'd taken previously. He made me feel instantly relieved and even put a smiley face on my prescription! I felt so happy I could cry! My mother was relieved as well. His reassurance has given me all the more strength to keep at my weight loss journey to live a healthier life! Thanks, Doc! I am forever grateful! :)",

I was a worried man with a lot of things specifically when it comes to my health and well-being. I am generally anxious and scared of hospitals and medical tests. When I get anxious or think of any negative situations, my heart starts racing and I end up with slight head-aches and pressure/tightness in my chest. This made me worry a lot given the type of personality I am. I also have white coat BP. With all these going on in my life, I was always hesitant to go to a doctor. But I started worrying a lot in the recent weeks and hence finally made up my mind and wanted to consult Dr. Harikrishnan P after reading some good reviews about him. I must say..it was a true blessing meeting this gentleman. Today I came out of the hospital with a perfectly fit man.  After hearing my problems, he demonstrated to me how breathing helps bring down my pulse rate. My first pulse reading was way too more :). He said I am completely fine and I just need some regular exercise. When I asked him for more he said that\u2019s all (no meds!) but for my benefit, he advised me to go for a heart package. I completed all the tests and the results are perfectly fine. I went back to him with the reports. He only said \u201cDint I tell you you are perfectly fine\u201d. He created a positive and beautiful impact on my life. Because now I am feeling like I am completely a new man with no such worries any more.  The best doctor I have ever met!",

We booked an appointment and had a consultation with him. His approach was friendly with us and he explained  the diagnosis procedure for cardiac problem in a layman's view. Before diagnosis, he recommended my father for blood test and covid test. Unfortunately, my father got positive for asymptomatic covid. Immediately we consulted him to know what can be done further. He was kind enough to reply us through whatsapp whenever we messaged him without time restrictions. He suggested to get advise from Apollo fever clinic. As per his advice, we consulted the clinic and underwent CT scan and they advised for home quarantine. Since it was asymptomatic, everything went smoothly. After 14 days of home isolation, my father became covid negative. With no further delay we contacted Dr.Harikrishnan. He suggested for immediate angiogram procedure in Apollo hospital, vanagaram.  My father was diagnosed with nearly 10 blocks in the coronary artery and the doctor suggested immediate surgery and refered a surgeon in the same hospital. The surgery was successful and my father's health recovered well. We are having regular check up with Dr. Harikrishnan.  Thanks a lot for his continuous support during our critical time.  ",

He is always very co-operative, helpful, joyful and his such supportive quality helped me in building my self-confidence. He not only prescribes medication for us, but also encourage us to follow a healthy lifestyle, physical exercise.\nNow I am more confident and in good health, active person and all credit goes to Dr. Harikrishnan.  I truly respect him for his passion toward his profession\nI have visited him for my father & uncle.

Then we proceeded with Angiogram as advice by Dr.Harikrishnan and doctor explained us that there are few minor blocks around 20 - 30% which can be cured by medicines instead of stunt with proper exercise and moderate diet plan as my Father was developing initial stage of diabetic. As advised by doctor my Father started following regular medications with proper exercise. \n           After three months we again went to meet Dr. Harikrishnan for a review with our latest results.

Way back in 2013, when my mother, aged 70, was rushed to Apollo, Greams Road, Chennai, to our good fortune, my mother was put in the hands of Dr. Hari. That day after having her vitals stabilised, my mother was advised to undergo open heart surgery for her triple vessel disease as per family member's discretion. No wonder, as a layman and with all my apprehensions, I was in a dilemma whether to go ahead with her surgery or not. What Dr.Hari told me at that point of time didn't make me think twice to make a decision. Dr.Hari just told me \"If it were my mother, I would want her in the operation theatre immediately, to give the best chance for her survival\".  My mother was operated on as per Dr.Hari's advice and guidance and the rest is history. Till date, touch wood, my mother is doing good. As I told, despite his high end degrees in the field of medicine and despite all his experience as a doctor, it is that 'warm humanly touch' which Dr.Hari adds while treating his patients sets him apart. Sometimes I even meet doctor Hari with the excuse of getting my parents checked up. He is such a wonderful doctor-friend. I wish doctor Hari all the very best to reach greater heights in his career.

He was patient enough to hear the issue and diagnose with precision and explain it to us in detail without panicking anyone. We were so impressed by his approach that my mom who had her apprehension to proceed with surgery all these days agreed to it immediately. Now my mom is absolutely fine and we are ever grateful to Dr. Harikrishnan for completely curing my Mom. ",

And when a doctor is warm and friendly, you forget your worries momentarily and are immediately made to feel at ease. Doctor Harikrishnan is one such divine doctor. I was worried about chest pains that I'd been feeling, he was sooooo attentive and his expertise spoke for itself. He didn't suggest unnecessary tests. Just to make sure everything was okay, he suggested only an Echo and a Treadmill Test. And as he'd said, the results were normal and he attributed the pains to gastric issues that had cropped up due to some strong medicines I'd taken previously. He made me feel instantly relieved and even put a smiley face on my prescription! I felt so happy I could cry! My mother was relieved as well. His reassurance has given me all the more strength to keep at my weight loss journey to live a healthier life! Thanks, Doc! I am forever grateful! :)",

I have booked an appointment and reached the hospital half an hour late. Hospital is located in koyambedu which is a heavy traffic area and our home is located in Avadi. After checking with receptionist regarding the doctors availability we were waiting for consultation suddenly this man came out of his room and called us and asked us regarding our appointment timing I told him we are coming from long and due to heavy traffic it got delayed he asked me to show the OLA cab booking timing just like a exam invigilator and he started shouting without considering the heart patient. We were very upset with his rude behavior.By reading google reviews I thought the doctor is very friendly that's why I have taken my father there.The only concern I have here is he may be very strict with the appointment timings but even if he left us unattended that will be more better option rather than shouting us in front of everyone. I have ever seen a doctor like him. * **** *** **** *** *** **** * *** **** *** *** *********Totally disappointed. Never ever recommend this doctor for anyone.",

I most definitely recommend this doctor. Visited a cardiologist for the first time as a precautionary measure for post-covid care.

He have a very good positive attitude. His post surgery treatment is so well. I am really thankful to Dr. Harikrishnan sir, he gave my mom a new life. I never expected that when you rush into a hospital in emergency you would get such a experienced doctor. He is so much concerned about his patience and their family.

Her Echo showed no pumping issues, Her ECG had some old changes and not concerning. They were concerned regarding Coronary artery disease and she was unable to do a TMT. Hence CT ANGIO done and this was reassuring.  Holter monitor was done to rule out any arrhythmias and this was also not concerning. \nHowever the patients son who is NOT a medical person started ADVISING ME what tablet to write. He was suggesting tablets to me that might improve his mother.  I was  very patient with him for three visits. I reassured the patient, patients husband and son that the symptoms are non cardiac. Advised life style changes and general physicians opinion. He wanted me to prescribe a particular tablet, which was not indicated for her. I tried to explain that and he was very aggressive and started shouting. I kindly requested him to leave with Namaste hands and he said I was the worst doctor he had known. The problem is that medicine cannot be practised with internet knowledge. ",

Next he sent me a snap shot of vitals and they were satisfactory and again I reassured that they were normal. \nI though enough time was spent to clarify his queries depending on the information given.\nI even asked him if I could speak to any doctors in the ICU ward which he could not help.\n Moreover he was telling that the doctors there do not know anything and hence he was seeking my opinion. \nIt is very difficult to guide treatment of critically ill people without getting proper info via online apps and I feel that he expected too much from the consultation.
