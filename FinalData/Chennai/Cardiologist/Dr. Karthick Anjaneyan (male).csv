None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr., Did angio at global hospital. Advised byepass surgery and Dr.Anto did the surgery on 5th Aug. 21. 1st review was on 14th, suiture removed. I was advised to take medicine prescribed and to apply ointment for the wounds. After 3months I was advised to take appointment with Dr.Karthik for review. I am doing as advised. I use to take BP reading every day morning. I found my BP High inspite of taking tablet both morning and evening. I have no way to contact or inform Dr. Today I asked for appointment and am given Thursday 12.30pm to meet Dr.Karthik.
I feel stressed. Expect my Cardiologist to provide atleast a direct communication so as to enable his patients like me to get relieved and to have a moral support. I pray the Almighty to have my High BP tension gets solved. Thank you for this facility to express my feelings ",2021-09-07 13:19:44,False,True,S.D.Ramachan,,,
