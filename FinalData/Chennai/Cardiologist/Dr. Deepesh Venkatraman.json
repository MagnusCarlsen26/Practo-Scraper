Coming to the medicines, he gave tablets for 5 days stating that will suffice, which is also worth mentioning as we are in a world where antibiotics are prescribed  for everything and anything. The clinic is also very clean and the aura of the place makes you feel like you will get better after the visit. The staffs are responsive and cooperative. ",
