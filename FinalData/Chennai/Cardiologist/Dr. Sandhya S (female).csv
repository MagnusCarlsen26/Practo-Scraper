,,0,0,YES,I was struggling with anxiety issues for 11 months and consulted many doctors and done basic heart work ups to rule out the cardio issues. I was looking for reassurance that time only came to know abt Dr. Sandhya. Dr. Sandhya is the most humble and kind hearted doctor who treats patients like family. She is always reachable and provides best support and response to all our queries at any time of the day. There is nothing more a patient can ask for than getting direct response from doctor even for any slightest doubts. She patiently explains the diagnosis and his interaction gives us confidence and positivity. Would personally recommend her to get consultedâ€¦,2022-11-21 10:46:53,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
