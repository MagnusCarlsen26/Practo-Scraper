Angio was done ,the block was removed  but stent was fixed by a leading international cardiologist.\nFollow up check up was done on 4 occasion s by him.\nBut unfortunately he never asked me to take ECG or Echocardiogram. Due to this on 23rd November 2021 I was breathless and could not lie down or sit.\nMy bladder was full. No urine output. This continued on 24 th November 2021. On 25 th November 2021 I was taken to Kavery for OP check up but all the cardiologists were busy in Angio and they refused to talk to me  at least over intercom.\nWe returned empty handed. No appointment in his private clinic.\nOn 26 th November God gave the contact of Dr E.BABU International Cardiologist through my younger brother.\nWe ,( myself and my wife) took an appointment by contacting Malar hospital and met him. By seeing condition of being wheel chair bound immediately instructed us to take ECG and Echocardiogram and added some medicines.\nWhat a miracle on the same night I had a good and sound sleep.\nAll my problems were completely resolved by his prescription of additional medicines.\nDr E  Babu is my saviour.\nDr E Babu is  my God..\nHe is very courteous to all the patients.\nHe is very kind and having lot of patience to hear the patient.\nHe is authority in his subject .Easily approachable. Very cordial .*****  **** *********.\nHighly Recommended.",

Doctor had immediately performed primary angioplasty with stenting in one of the vessels and performed staged revascularization on the other two vessels.  His quality of life is improved now.  He is recovered very faster with angioplasty plus stenting.",
