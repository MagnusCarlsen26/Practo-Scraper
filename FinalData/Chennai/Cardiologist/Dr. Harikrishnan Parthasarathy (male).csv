After checking with receptionist regarding the doctors availability we were waiting for consultation suddenly this man came out of his room and called us and asked us regarding our appointment timing I told him we are coming from long and due to heavy traffic it got delayed he asked me to show the OLA cab booking timing just like a exam invigilator and he started shouting without considering the heart patient. We were very upset with his rude behavior.By reading google reviews I thought the doctor is very friendly that's why I have taken my father there.The only concern I have here is he may be very strict with the appointment timings but even if he left us unattended that will be more better option rather than shouting us in front of everyone.
