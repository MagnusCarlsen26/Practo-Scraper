He sent me first a pic of the ventilation settings, I responded via practo app to request him to send the right readings. Next he sent me a snap shot of vitals and they were satisfactory and again I reassured that they were normal.

 Moreover he was telling that the doctors there do not know anything and hence he was seeking my opinion.
