None,None,0,0,YES,"My father in law age 81 had repeated blackouts.  Consulted Dr Sanjai at SIMS hospital. With ECG report he clearly explained that because of slow heart rate he had blackouts.  He performed Dual chamber pace maker surgery.  Considering age and other comorbidities, he patiently  did procedure.  My father in law was able to walk from 2nd day onwards and fully recovered. Now he is able to walk confidentially 3 times a day. All thanks to Dr Sanjai. ",2022-05-17 12:04:01,False,True,Sundaram,,,
