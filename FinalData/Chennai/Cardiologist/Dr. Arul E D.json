And it was 180/ 100 and he told to contact physician. He checked it for 3 days and my BP was not coming down. Suddenly even my BP was down due to heavy dosage.

First upon entering into his room for consultation, he doesn't even look at the patient, he simply see the computer and talk to patient as he take notes, this shows he has no valuable time for the patient and doesn't give listening ears. If the patient genuinely describes a chest pain that he is undergoing, he just brushes off immediately saying don't imagine things as if the pain is not real. On questioning that he cannot talk to patient rudely like that and the pain experienced is real he irresponsibly tells the patient: so what?! You don't have a heart attack right?! Does that mean people who have any chest discomfort cannot see him to get treated? Only heart attack patients can be seen by him. How irrresponsible and arrogant attitude. Absolutely ZERO BED SIDE MAaNNERS, ZERO COMPASSION, ZERO FRIENDLISNESS, and what not.\n\nWe do respect the medical treatment as a doctor he is providing to his patients but the way he talks is absolutely rude.\n\nWill not recommend this Dr if you really want a caring Dr to solve your health problems.",
