,,0,0,Yes,I had met the doctor and it was for vertigo and continuous neck pain. Doctor was good in consulting me. I would like to recommend the doctor to other people. Doctor was friendly with me. He told to reduce dosage of tablets as he had given high dose earlier. Entire body check up was done of Rs 3000 package. And report was good. There was no waiting time in the hospital when we went. Initially I went to physiotherapy and BP was checked. And it was 180/ 100 and he told to contact physician. He checked it for 3 days and my BP was not coming down. Suddenly even my BP was down due to heavy dosage. I took second opinion with Dr. Arul E D. Treadmill test was done. Diet and walking was suggested. He was friendly. ,2021-06-05 13:04:41,False,True,Venu C,,,

,,0,0,NO,"Dr Arul has worsst bedside maanners. First upon entering into his room for consultation, he doesn't even look at the patient, he simply see the computer and talk to patient as he take notes, this shows he has no valuable time for the patient and doesn't give listening ears. If the patient genuinely describes a chest pain that he is undergoing, he just brushes off immediately saying don't imagine things as if the pain is not real. On questioning that he cannot talk to patient rudely like that and the pain experienced is real he irresponsibly tells the patient: so what?! You don't have a heart attack right?! Does that mean people who have any chest discomfort cannot see him to get treated? Only heart attack patients can be seen by him. How irrresponsible and arrogant attitude. Absolutely ZERO BED SIDE MAaNNERS, ZERO COMPASSION, ZERO FRIENDLISNESS, and what not.

We do respect the medical treatment as a doctor he is providing to his patients but the way he talks is absolutely rude.

Will not recommend this Dr if you really want a caring Dr to solve your health problems.",2022-07-13 07:40:00,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
