With ECG report he clearly explained that because of slow heart rate he had blackouts.  He performed Dual chamber pace maker surgery.  Considering age and other comorbidities, he patiently  did procedure.  My father in law was able to walk from 2nd day onwards and fully recovered. Now he is able to walk confidentially 3 times a day. All thanks to Dr Sanjai. ",
