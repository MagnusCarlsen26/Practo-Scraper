He will give appropriate medical advice
I went to the doctor for my mom constantly for Angio   My mother's back pain has not subsided and I have seen more than 10 doctors

I finally met him 
By Dr. Basheer Orthopaedic Surgeon -vadapalni 

I have taken it to him and he gives proper advice to mother, medicines and pills and answers in a beautiful manner and half of the disease is cured by his speech. 

He is the right doctor during this period who will prepare you some medicine in the right way and send you home in good condition.

Now my mother has got back pain relief because of her proper medical advice and this happened.My sincere thanks. *** ** **** ******* ******* **********",2024-03-28 19:19:36,False,True,Mohammed sharief,,,
