Rendering healthcare service is complex and no-one (the doctor included) can give a fare guess of how long each procedure is going to take. The accuracy of the guess gets ruptured more when treatment involves young children. In such a scenario half an hour waiting time is fair from our perspective.

Also patients with dental emergencies(accute dental pain) need to be accommodated in the schedule amidst appointments. Onset of Dental pain does not fetch an appointment before it arrives.

You waiting time should have been because of these probabilities. 

However, the waiting time can be offset by deputing work, meaning scattering work with other doctors which we don't believe.
