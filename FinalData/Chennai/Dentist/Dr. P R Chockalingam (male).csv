Let me share my horrifying  and painful experience .
I consulted this doctor , for my severe tooth pain which had a filling and I knew in my mind it needed a RCT . 
Further I relied on practo review for this doctor  and after completion of RCT ,   trouble started .

Puss formed in my tooth , gums were infected and it was all RED  and swollen.I trusted the doc and went for multiple visit assuming he will give me the right remedy.
Doctor was so egoistic he did
Didn't accepted he made faulty treatment with very inferior quality GP material ( which I later came to know from other 2 endodontist)
Instead of accepting the fact after x-ray that RCT was not done properly and there was improper gap in both the canals, he suggested to wait if not cure then go for a Gum Surgery.I was scared and started going for second opinions.

I consulted multiple other dental clinic endodontist, and got a written recommendation from 2 for redoing RCT for both the canals,as there was a space in the canal and better quality of GP should be used, else infection and swelling of gum will continue.

Due to this mistake of Doctor, I had to undergo again re-RCT. Now I don't feel the same issues as it was before.

He explained every step of the process patiently, both to the child as well as to us (parents). Posting this message so that other anxious parents could make the right decision.

The accuracy of the guess gets ruptured more when treatment involves young children. In such a scenario half an hour waiting time is fair from our perspective.

Also patients with dental emergencies(accute dental pain) need to be accommodated in the schedule amidst appointments. Onset of Dental pain does not fetch an appointment before it arrives.

You waiting time should have been because of these probabilities. 

However, the waiting time can be offset by deputing work, meaning scattering work with other doctors which we don't believe.
