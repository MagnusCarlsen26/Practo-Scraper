Dr. Nishidha demonstrated expertise in handling these critical processes for children, and the entire team was both skilled and cooperative. Following the treatment, Dr. Kirthiga ensured free follow-up checks, and I appreciate her kindness in granting a discount upon request. I am truly delighted with the entire experience.",

She started bleeding profusely and her upper two central incisors started wobbling. This happened in the night of 31st December 2022, at around 11:40. At best we could access a children hospital in the vicinity, where the doctor on emergency duty attended and suggested us to visit a dentist instead. But which Dentist would be available at that time of the night? So the doctor gave her first aid and we left. Next morning which happened to be 1st of January 2023, we tried taking an appointment with a Dentist, but not a single dentist was available as it was a Sunday and more over being New Year Holiday. And while searching online for a dentist, we got to know that there are pediatric dentists as well. Very difficulty we found a Pediatric Dentist Clinic on google, and that was of Microsmiles. With almost no hope we contacted this clinic as we thought even this would be closed . But to our surprise they attended our call and when they heard that it was an emergency, even though the Clinic was closed, they were not hesitant to open for us. When we reached the clinic we were pleased to see their facility, which had a small play area for kids, a small dental reclining chair that kids would love, and a monitor fixed to the ceiling just above the recling chair where they played cartoon of our Kid's choice to keep them engaged. In short I would say it appears as a toy dental clinic with real dental services.Our daughter's injury was examined patiently by Dr. Kirthiga and was prescribed with few medicines. After her comments, we felt relieved.On enquiring I understood that Microsmiles is just not for Kids, but they even offer Rectification services of Root Canals improperly done elsewhere.That's not all, the clinic is managed by 2 Doctors, who seem to be proficient in what they are doing - Mr. Praveen Rajesh and Ms. Kirthiga M.I would strongly recommend anyone requiringdental related services, to visit Microsmiles. And I am confident that they would have a fulfilling experience.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

He neither felt any pain nor had any difficulties in eating but we wanted to stop the progression as it will take atleast 4 years for the milk teeth to fall, so we wanted to get it treated. We tried many paedo dentists and all of them suggested to do a filling as they are just milk teeth. We went for the teeth filling but after couple of months we started noticing bad breath issues and black stains.We explored many options and found Dr. Krithiga. She was the first one to diagnose it as Dental carries and also suggested it must be treated (by doing root canal with dental caps under general anesthesia ) before he starts feeling pain and eating issues.Initially, I was totally against the GA but talking to a fellow parent whose kid just had the surgery convinced us a bit that we are doing the best for our champ.But Even on the day of surgery we were still afraid and questioned ourselves if we really need to do this. But Dr. Krithiga consoled us and assured that everything would be fine. After almost 2 restless hours surgery was done and to my surprise she had done a great job with my son's teeth. He didn't face any after surgery effects except for the bleeding on the gums. We tortured her with lots if follow up questions in the coming days but she handled and answered all our queries patiently.Really appreciate her and all the staffs in the clinic. I'd definitely recommend her to all those who are in need especially for toddlers and kids.",

Before coming to Microsmiles, we had made 9 different visits in multiple different dental clinics, and ended up with a really bad experience with our daughter experiencing unbearable pain. But with Microsmiles, everything about the place just works - its literally god-given - they have a nice little play area, some drawing books, dental chair designed for kids, and the most magical thing- a tv on the ceiling above the dental chair. Our daughter was excited to step in to the clinic day 1 itself. Dr Nishidha was so sensitive and gained the trust of our daughter first, before the final pulpectomy. All-in-all it turned to be such a happy, positive, and most important un-painful experience for our daughter. .A big big thanks to the entire team of Microsmiles - you guys are angels. ",

Times like these prove that being at the correct place at the correct time is very important.Since the tooth hadn't come out completely,doctor placed temporary wire to try and save the tooth. Not everyone knows of these specialized treatments that are available and I too dint know pediatric dentistry existed too.Kudos to the excellent service provided by her and great follow up care.Good clinics like this should reach people who look for good and honest treatment.Thanks once again for trying to save my kids smile\ud83d\ude0aI'm sure if I had gone anywhere else, my son would have  had his teeth removed, even without giving a try to allow it to heal naturally.",

The facility is designed with kids in mind, creating a friendly environment that ensured my 7-year-old daughter remained calm and happy throughout the root canal, filling, and capping procedures. Dr. Nishidha demonstrated expertise in handling these critical processes for children, and the entire team was both skilled and cooperative. Following the treatment, Dr. Kirthiga ensured free follow-up checks, and I appreciate her kindness in granting a discount upon request. I am truly delighted with the entire experience.",

She started bleeding profusely and her upper two central incisors started wobbling. This happened in the night of 31st December 2022, at around 11:40. At best we could access a children hospital in the vicinity, where the doctor on emergency duty attended and suggested us to visit a dentist instead. But which Dentist would be available at that time of the night? So the doctor gave her first aid and we left. Next morning which happened to be 1st of January 2023, we tried taking an appointment with a Dentist, but not a single dentist was available as it was a Sunday and more over being New Year Holiday. And while searching online for a dentist, we got to know that there are pediatric dentists as well. Very difficulty we found a Pediatric Dentist Clinic on google, and that was of Microsmiles. With almost no hope we contacted this clinic as we thought even this would be closed . But to our surprise they attended our call and when they heard that it was an emergency, even though the Clinic was closed, they were not hesitant to open for us. When we reached the clinic we were pleased to see their facility, which had a small play area for kids, a small dental reclining chair that kids would love, and a monitor fixed to the ceiling just above the recling chair where they played cartoon of our Kid's choice to keep them engaged. In short I would say it appears as a toy dental clinic with real dental services.Our daughter's injury was examined patiently by Dr. Kirthiga and was prescribed with few medicines. After her comments, we felt relieved.On enquiring I understood that Microsmiles is just not for Kids, but they even offer Rectification services of Root Canals improperly done elsewhere.That's not all, the clinic is managed by 2 Doctors, who seem to be proficient in what they are doing - Mr. Praveen Rajesh and Ms. Kirthiga M.I would strongly recommend anyone requiringdental related services, to visit Microsmiles. And I am confident that they would have a fulfilling experience.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

He neither felt any pain nor had any difficulties in eating but we wanted to stop the progression as it will take atleast 4 years for the milk teeth to fall, so we wanted to get it treated. We tried many paedo dentists and all of them suggested to do a filling as they are just milk teeth. We went for the teeth filling but after couple of months we started noticing bad breath issues and black stains.We explored many options and found Dr. Krithiga. She was the first one to diagnose it as Dental carries and also suggested it must be treated (by doing root canal with dental caps under general anesthesia ) before he starts feeling pain and eating issues.Initially, I was totally against the GA but talking to a fellow parent whose kid just had the surgery convinced us a bit that we are doing the best for our champ.But Even on the day of surgery we were still afraid and questioned ourselves if we really need to do this. But Dr. Krithiga consoled us and assured that everything would be fine. After almost 2 restless hours surgery was done and to my surprise she had done a great job with my son's teeth. He didn't face any after surgery effects except for the bleeding on the gums. We tortured her with lots if follow up questions in the coming days but she handled and answered all our queries patiently.Really appreciate her and all the staffs in the clinic. I'd definitely recommend her to all those who are in need especially for toddlers and kids.",

But with Microsmiles, everything about the place just works - its literally god-given - they have a nice little play area, some drawing books, dental chair designed for kids, and the most magical thing- a tv on the ceiling above the dental chair. Our daughter was excited to step in to the clinic day 1 itself. Dr Nishidha was so sensitive and gained the trust of our daughter first, before the final pulpectomy. All-in-all it turned to be such a happy, positive, and most important un-painful experience for our daughter. .A big big thanks to the entire team of Microsmiles - you guys are angels. ",

Not everyone knows of these specialized treatments that are available and I too dint know pediatric dentistry existed too.Kudos to the excellent service provided by her and great follow up care.Good clinics like this should reach people who look for good and honest treatment.Thanks once again for trying to save my kids smile\ud83d\ude0aI'm sure if I had gone anywhere else, my son would have  had his teeth removed, even without giving a try to allow it to heal naturally.",

We remember that you had been to few other dental clinics before visiting us who could not handle the 4 year old child. We at microsmiles, despite being our official holiday, opened the clinic on your request since the child was in pain and treated her successfully with 2 root canals. We informed you that the fillings done were only a temporary solution and caps has to be done for both. We also insisted that you get the CAP done for the root canal treated teeth, however you denied it and asked us to just leave it with a simple filling. At this point we had clearly mentioned that this was not a definite solution and they wouldn\u2019t last for more than 3-5 days, and that a cap for the 2 root canal treated teeth will be necessary. At the end of the treatment, the bill payment debacle could have been avoided since a written consent for payment of Rs 9000/- was taken before starting the treatment itself.  At Microsmiles we aim at patient satisfaction and best treatment outcomes. The child friendly environment that we have has been designed to provide the best dental experience for a child. Please understand that we provided you with the best Pediatric dental treatment available across our country and relentless bargaining for mere 500/- was unwarranted. We are deeply hurt to see such reviews even after giving the best possible treatment for the child. We regret to have caused you any inconvenience.",

They were also very reasonable with the way they charged for the treatment. And I must mention, the clinic is hygienic and very neatly maintained which is highly important now! I will recommend Microsmiles to everyone. Thank you very much Dr. Krithika and Dr. Praveen. Kudos to your work! \ud83d\ude0a",
