During lockdown I traveled to Chennai for other medical reasons for limited days and I'd been avoiding the dentist for years due to bad experiences in Mumbai (hometown). Then due to a sudden toothache I had to make an emergency appointment for a RCT at Dent Eazee Dental Clinic in Chennai. 
 
Firstly they followed proper lockdown rules during this COVID pandemic which is the best thing. 
 

Trust me, I have experienced one of the best Dental care services at Dent Eazee Dental Clinic. The ambience at Dent Eazee is the best, it’s almost like being in a lounge. Best quality and the first class way that I have been treated. 
 

Dr. Phani & Dr. Vimala – are very professional, ***awesome treatment plan*** (very impressive), excellent, gentle, kind & calm and many more😊
