None,"Broken Teeth,Tooth Abscess,",0,0,Yes,Doctor Vimala & Phani are both extremely talented and is top notch in what they do.

She is very straight forward and an unconventional doctor who makes you feel at ease being it just a consultation or a procedure. I still remember the day i took my kids for their appointment and I landed up at the clinics doorsteps worrying about not giving the kids a traumatic dental experience. Doctor Vimala handled the kids with so much of patience and made it a fun memory for them indeed inspite of teeth extractions and the kids were so comfortable which in fact gave me the confidence and trust to  reach out to her when it was my turn.
