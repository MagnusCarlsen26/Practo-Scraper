Initially we went to a hospital at keelkattalai for tooth pain and the pain killer they gave caused heavy infections.

and after a day we took appointment with Dr. Suresh he was very kind and given proper procedures but already the infection spreaded all over the organs which leads to internal bleeding because of his advice i admitted my father at a super speciality hospital ICU and during the hospitalization Dr. Suresh contacted me 4 times a day to know about the status of my father which was very supportive for me at that moment,  

After a month treatment my father recovered now and then now we went again to Dr. Suresh for my father tooth problems and again am surprised to see the care and kindness while providing the treatment. 

I have never seen such a great Doctor Who cares this much really am thankful for him.
