The extraction itself was remarkably smooth and nearly pain-free, a testament to Dr. Revathi's expertise and gentle approach.\n\nThe aftercare instructions were clear and helpful, contributing to a swift and comfortable recovery. I greatly appreciate the follow-up call to check on my well-being, which reinforced the level of care and attention provided.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Revathi to anyone needing dental care, especially for complex procedures like wisdom tooth extractions. Thank you, Dr. Revathi, for your outstanding service and dedication to patient care.\n\n---\nAshok Kumar ",

Since then, I have broken a couple of my lower front teeth at age 16 and have tried to manage through dentures.  Procrastinate to address this permanently due to ignorance and resistance to explore the right doctor/clinic. Since there is a plan to move abroad in the coming weeks, I have decided to fix the missing teeth during my visit to Chennai. I have checked the procedures and costs in a couple of dental clinics, including one of the very famous chains in Chennai. The procedure proposals, timeliness including fees are not convincing. I heard about Dr Revathi through my brother's reference and visited her clinic in Kattupakkam. The 1st-day procedure of grinding the adjacent teeth is to introduce Zirconia Crowns & Bridges as a replacement and measurement, the stage 1 root canal to avoid the sensitivity at a later stage.  She & her assistant stayed very late (till 10:45 PM) to complete this procedure. The next day she has given the temporary teeth after completion of the root canal.  she also very accurately picked the teeth' colour shades ( Dual shades - A3.5, A2) under natural light for permanent teeth. We have decided to go with 3M Lava Zirconia Premium Crowns from DentCare Lab.  Next, I went to the Vipassana Meditation program for ten days without any contact. She is very kind for an appointment @ 2 pm on Sunday to fix the permanent teeth since we left for Delhi the following day. The return from the Vipassana program got delayed by 1 Hr & she patiently waited till 3 pm to start the procedure, which went well the first time, right without even a minor hiccup, including the shades. Now, my missing teeth look original, and it has added tremendous confident while talking and smiling. Dr Revathi also explained the different dental procedures available during our interaction, giving us enough wisdom about dental practices. I have started recommending Dr Revathi to our nears and dears to bring back smile on their face.  ",

From the initial consultation to the post-operative care, Dr. Revathi and the staff were professional, compassionate, and highly skilled.\n\nDr. Revathi explained the procedure thoroughly, addressing all my concerns and ensuring I felt comfortable and informed every step of the way. The extraction itself was remarkably smooth and nearly pain-free, a testament to Dr. Revathi's expertise and gentle approach.\n\nThe aftercare instructions were clear and helpful, contributing to a swift and comfortable recovery. I greatly appreciate the follow-up call to check on my well-being, which reinforced the level of care and attention provided.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Revathi to anyone needing dental care, especially for complex procedures like wisdom tooth extractions. Thank you, Dr. Revathi, for your outstanding service and dedication to patient care.\n\n---\nAshok Kumar ",

                "review_text": "Dr Revathi is excellent in all dental practices and specialises in Crowns & Bridge procedures. Since then, I have broken a couple of my lower front teeth at age 16 and have tried to manage through dentures.  Procrastinate to address this permanently due to ignorance and resistance to explore the right doctor/clinic. Since there is a plan to move abroad in the coming weeks, I have decided to fix the missing teeth during my visit to Chennai. I have checked the procedures and costs in a couple of dental clinics, including one of the very famous chains in Chennai. The procedure proposals, timeliness including fees are not convincing. I heard about Dr Revathi through my brother's reference and visited her clinic in Kattupakkam. The 1st-day procedure of grinding the adjacent teeth is to introduce Zirconia Crowns & Bridges as a replacement and measurement, the stage 1 root canal to avoid the sensitivity at a later stage.  She & her assistant stayed very late (till 10:45 PM) to complete this procedure. The next day she has given the temporary teeth after completion of the root canal.  she also very accurately picked the teeth' colour shades ( Dual shades - A3.5, A2) under natural light for permanent teeth. We have decided to go with 3M Lava Zirconia Premium Crowns from DentCare Lab.  Next, I went to the Vipassana Meditation program for ten days without any contact. She is very kind for an appointment @ 2 pm on Sunday to fix the permanent teeth since we left for Delhi the following day. The return from the Vipassana program got delayed by 1 Hr & she patiently waited till 3 pm to start the procedure, which went well the first time, right without even a minor hiccup, including the shades. Now, my missing teeth look original, and it has added tremendous confident while talking and smiling. Dr Revathi also explained the different dental procedures available during our interaction, giving us enough wisdom about dental practices. I have started recommending Dr Revathi to our nears and dears to bring back smile on their face.  ",

Can say, even much cheaper than few other medical facilities for the same required treatment.Finally i wish the doctor goodluck and sucess in her dental profession to keep going strong and help around those seeking patients .\nThank You",

Place was very hygiene.We decided to perform an extraction of infected teeth. Doctor was caring enough to wait patiently and remove infected teeth with less pain as the anesthesia took time to take effect. I highly recommend to give a visit to this clinic for dental issues where you will leave with 100% satisification. Also I would like to extend my thanks as there are not many dental clinics open during this pandemic.",
