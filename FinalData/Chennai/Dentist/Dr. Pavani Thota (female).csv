"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I and my little one had amazing experience with Dr.Pavani. This visit was for my 3year Son Vedha Narshima with tooth decay and severe tooth ache. 

Dr.Pavani explained as to what treatment she is going to do. She showed the before and after treatment photos which makes it very clear for the patient to understand.

The assurance and the explanations that she gives before the procedure is extra ordinary. It's in very simple terms for anyone to understand and she lists out the pros and cons and lets us take a call. She is very straight forward and an unconventional doctor who makes you feel at ease being it just a consultation or a procedure.

She is just brilliant and a master of her trade and I highly recommend her.

Pros :

The clinic is very neat and well maintained. 
Highly professional with great expertise.
Great patience in dealing with kids.
Good environment to engage kids.

Cons: - NONE
