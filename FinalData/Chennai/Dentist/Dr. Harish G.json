It requires more of engineering skills too and hand work for drilling tooth. That is why I had read hundreds of reviews in google, practo, quora, online and consulted a number of dentists in various places before meeting Dr.Harish for my fractured front tooth due to accident, with a long and complicated history .It took me a good 5 years to finally decide to get a treatment for this, is because I couldn't meet a dentist I could fully trust until I found Mr & Mrs Tooth. Dr.Harish didn\u2019t hide anything and explained everything in and out about the different treatment options, techniques and also the grade of crown materials, costs involved (Very Transparent-Nothing Hidden) how the warranty applies for it. Felt like worth for waiting him and to get it done as he patiently explained every single question clearly even when the patients are waiting outside to give me the valid importance. Im so happy that my teeths look just like natural and I owe a big thanks to him wholeheartedly for making me smile. My Treatment only took exactly a week and I am posting this after a month. Will review it during follow-ups too",

It requires more of engineering skills too and hand work for drilling tooth. That is why I had read hundreds of reviews in google, practo, quora, online and consulted a number of dentists in various places before meeting Dr.Harish for my fractured front tooth due to accident, with a long and complicated history .It took me a good 5 years to finally decide to get a treatment for this, is because I couldn't meet a dentist I could fully trust until I found Mr & Mrs Tooth. Dr.Harish didn\u2019t hide anything and explained everything in and out about the different treatment options, techniques and also the grade of crown materials, costs involved (Very Transparent-Nothing Hidden) how the warranty applies for it. Felt like worth for waiting him and to get it done as he patiently explained every single question clearly even when the patients are waiting outside to give me the valid importance. Im so happy that my teeths look just like natural and I owe a big thanks to him wholeheartedly for making me smile. My Treatment only took exactly a week and I am posting this after a month. Will review it during follow-ups too",

I had come to India for vacation and had few days left to travel back. As we know the root canal process takes days, Dr.Harish understood my situation and tried to complete the procedure at the earliest. I appreciate his advise and care post treatment. I would highly recommend Dr.Harish.",

Then, I found this clinic where doctors are More patience, experienced and moreover they are following all COVID protocols. I have met to Dr.Harish and his team where he clearly discussed all options. I agreed to go for the treatment for the infected tooth, 2 dentists performed the cleaning and restoring of my tooth, the root canal was done successfully, and I am completely alright. I have gone through total 6 session and two painless root canal treatment.

There was no pain post extraction , which was quite confusing to me , as i was expecting pain.\n\nOne more amazing thing has been the follow up which he has done post the extraction , it makes one feel taken care of. \n\nThanks to Dr. Harish.

Other doctors suggested to remove all Wisdom teeth and some even suggested general anaesthesia for removal of all wisdom teeth which was not even needed and were charging unreasonable amount .\n\nTreatment :\nTreatment was painless , literally painless . The only pain that happened was once the procedure is over and the wound is healing . But for that as well doctor gave pain medicine . \n\nRecent visit during corona :\nThe clinic is well equipped with pp kits and air purifiers . Proper sanitisation is maintained .",

We have seen allergic reactions in gums with the metal crowns or the metal with ceramic coated ones after few years as its mostly made of base metals like nickel or chromium and that\u2019s why we recommended you the standard ones which you have misunderstood. You have to understand the material science inherent in it rather than to see the cost difference alone.",
