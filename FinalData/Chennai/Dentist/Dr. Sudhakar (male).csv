              My dentist experience at ‘Gift A Smile’
On the 12th of January, my tooth was going to get pulled out by Dr.Sudhakar at “”Gift A Smile dental “”care. This was my first dental visit. I was a bit excited and nervous on how it would go. 
After reaching, he told me that he was going to put a spray that will make my lips, tongue and gum numb and dry.
The spray was bitter and kind of spicy and it was very tough to hold it in my mouth. Then after a couple of minutes, he told me to spit it out. After that, he gave an injection of anesthesia and then my whole mouth was dry and numb. While pulling my tooth out, he was distracting me by talking so that I feel calm and not nervous. After he took the tooth, he showed it to me and then only I realized that he had taken it out because I didn’t feel a thing!
he told me to have ice-cream after I go home and to not have hot things. I was very happy because I could have ice-cream!!
