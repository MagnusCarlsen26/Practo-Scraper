I was suffering from tooth pain caused due to cavities for about 3 years and was skipping the RCT thinking it was painful, risky and expensive as I had no idea what it was. I couldn't eat and skipped many of my favourite food like popcorn or non veg food items or ice cream for years as these gave me sleepless nights due to to tooth pain.  

As the pain started becoming unbearable I chose to visit Dr. Sharan's Dental clinic with lot of hesitation. I had fear of the scary Root Canal therapy and was looking to request for some temporary pain killing fix. 

But after visiting the clinic, Doctor madam helped me understand all the issues and patiently explained what and how it needs to be fixed. I had accepted for root canal for 4 tooth and also asked for tooth cleaning. The most impressive part of the whole treatment was that the RCT didn't even pain a tiny bit for any of the 4 tooth. I felt absolutely no pain during the treatment or the next day or days after the treatment. And within next few days I was able to happily eat anything I like with no pain. I am extremely satisfied with the treatment and the results and I am grateful to madam for fixing one of my greatest problems of my life which is to eat comfortably without pain. I almost forgot I had tooth pain for a month now. Thank you! 😊

There were no issues with wait times, I had to step in right on the time of my appointment and almost I could walk in without any waiting. The fees was also affordable and far less compared to the fees collected from the other clinics. This has to be the best dental clinic for our area. I will highly recommend anyone with dental problems to visit this clinic and get your tooth fixed !
