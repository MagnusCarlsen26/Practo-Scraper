She does not force any of the dental procedures on the patient, rather provides enough details about the issue, the procedure options (including wait and watch) and it’s outcome there by allowing the patient to understand and decide the best course of action. 
Her procedures, especially dental fillings are done with patient’s sensitivity in mind. She doesn’t time box a treatment which is  usually done at corporate dental care. She slows down the process if patient finds it sensitive and doesn’t mind if the treatment time gets extended. 
Her impeccable attention to detail and fore-bearing  nature ensures the treatment addresses the cause and at the same provides an almost pain free experience to the patient. In my opinion her dental care is one of the best  offered in and around Chennai.
