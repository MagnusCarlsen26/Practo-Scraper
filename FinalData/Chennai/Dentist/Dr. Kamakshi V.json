I was referred to Dr Kamakshi by my friend and went through all the reviews before visiting her. Was given genuine suggestions regarding the problems I had with clear explanation on advantages and disadvantages of each and cost for each was informed prior. For the expertise the implant cost or for the other treatmens the cost was much reasonable. They look in to fixing the problem for long time rather than treating it for time being. There was complete transparency at each step. The entire team is very warm and welcoming and they do check up the next day after the treatment. There was one review mentioning how there are so many dental clinics in each street and how we need to choose one. It's so true. Since the location is interior I wasn't aware of it now I m recommending to all known to me. Good job team Lumident. Thanks for fixing my teeth. ",

I was little bit confused because of past experiences with other dentists. After initial check up , she provided review on my teeth and suggested me for few treatments which are actually required. I was little bit negligent after that and suddenly pain started in my tooth(after 2 months) and it was unbearable. I visited the doctor again and she suggested me same treatment. 3days back, i got the tooth extracted and it was easy process and i didn't feel much discomfort. They made me feel ease and handling was good during the process. After extraction, pain subsided from next day and really feeling comfortable today. \r\nI can suggest those who are facing any kind of dental problems, try to get resolved in the initial stage itself , don't delay as i did. Dr. Kamakshi is very good, cool, and experienced doctor. *** ***** *** *** **** ********* *** only suggests if it's really required.  Dr.Kamakshi is a very good dentist in my opinion. I am giving this review so that it will be useful to others people who are really in search of good dentists. These days i see in every street there are 3-4 dental clinics and we need to choose the best one Dr. Kamakshi is good in treatment, affordable and cool doctor.",

No sharp edges on the filling, surface neatly polished so that there absolutely no discomfort to the patient. I highly recommend Dr. Kamakshi for her flawless work.",

I was told it'll close if I wear retainers and it never did for more than five years as the gap was more. I used to restrict my smile because of this and I was always self conscious. In my hometown they said no other option is available than wearing retainers which we obviously despise. Then I came to know about Dr. Kamakshi through a sister of mine. The first visit with her gave me hope that this can be treated. She said using crown on all the four teeth will close the gap. She took pics for my smile, did digital work on them and sent me the picture showing this is how it'll look after the treatment which gave me an idea. She explained everything clearly and politely and left the decision to me if I need this or not. After that I came for 2 sittings. One for measurement and temporary fix and the other for the final fitting and fillings. No one can differentiate between the real teeth and the crown. The teeth color is perfect and the size and shape are perfect too. I'm so happy with the result and the entire team was patient and caring throughout the entire process. Kindly visit her if you don't think you can fix something and she will tell you otherwise \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d",

I was referred to Dr Kamakshi by my friend and went through all the reviews before visiting her. Was given genuine suggestions regarding the problems I had with clear explanation on advantages and disadvantages of each and cost for each was informed prior. For the expertise the implant cost or for the other treatmens the cost was much reasonable. They look in to fixing the problem for long time rather than treating it for time being. There was complete transparency at each step. The entire team is very warm and welcoming and they do check up the next day after the treatment. There was one review mentioning how there are so many dental clinics in each street and how we need to choose one. It's so true. Since the location is interior I wasn't aware of it now I m recommending to all known to me. Good job team Lumident. Thanks for fixing my teeth. ",

I was little bit confused because of past experiences with other dentists. After initial check up , she provided review on my teeth and suggested me for few treatments which are actually required. I was little bit negligent after that and suddenly pain started in my tooth(after 2 months) and it was unbearable. I visited the doctor again and she suggested me same treatment. 3days back, i got the tooth extracted and it was easy process and i didn't feel much discomfort. They made me feel ease and handling was good during the process. After extraction, pain subsided from next day and really feeling comfortable today. \r\nI can suggest those who are facing any kind of dental problems, try to get resolved in the initial stage itself , don't delay as i did. Dr. Kamakshi is very good, cool, and experienced doctor. *** ***** *** *** **** ********* *** only suggests if it's really required.  Dr.Kamakshi is a very good dentist in my opinion. I am giving this review so that it will be useful to others people who are really in search of good dentists. These days i see in every street there are 3-4 dental clinics and we need to choose the best one Dr. Kamakshi is good in treatment, affordable and cool doctor.",

I was told it'll close if I wear retainers and it never did for more than five years as the gap was more. I used to restrict my smile because of this and I was always self conscious. In my hometown they said no other option is available than wearing retainers which we obviously despise. Then I came to know about Dr. Kamakshi through a sister of mine. The first visit with her gave me hope that this can be treated. She said using crown on all the four teeth will close the gap. She took pics for my smile, did digital work on them and sent me the picture showing this is how it'll look after the treatment which gave me an idea. She explained everything clearly and politely and left the decision to me if I need this or not. After that I came for 2 sittings. One for measurement and temporary fix and the other for the final fitting and fillings. No one can differentiate between the real teeth and the crown. The teeth color is perfect and the size and shape are perfect too. I'm so happy with the result and the entire team was patient and caring throughout the entire process. Kindly visit her if you don't think you can fix something and she will tell you otherwise \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d",
