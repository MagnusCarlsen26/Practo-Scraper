"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Cleaning,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Chandra is the best doctor I've ever experienced in my life.. I've undergone 6 dental scaling/cleaning till date.. Dr.Chandra is the best among them, with respect to,
1. the way she undertook the treatment.
2. the patient friendly approach.
3. the quality of the treatment.
4. the flexible techniques based on patient's comfort.
4. explaining the patient what's the actual problem and ways to overcome that.
5. keeping the patient innformed of what's she actually doing, throughout the treatment period.

My opinion is..
A Doctor who keeps the patient in their comfort zone, is far better than a traditional Doctor who just performs the treatment..

It's so difficult now-a-days to see such a Doctor.. Thanks a lot to Dr.Chandra..
