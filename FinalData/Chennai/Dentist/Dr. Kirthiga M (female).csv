At best we could access a children hospital in the vicinity, where the doctor on emergency duty attended and suggested us to visit a dentist instead.

Next morning which happened to be 1st of January 2023, we tried taking an appointment with a Dentist, but not a single dentist was available as it was a Sunday and more over being New Year Holiday. And while searching online for a dentist, we got to know that there are pediatric dentists as well. Very difficulty we found a Pediatric Dentist Clinic on google, and that was of Microsmiles. With almost no hope we contacted this clinic as we thought even this would be closed . But to our surprise they attended our call and when they heard that it was an emergency, even though the Clinic was closed, they were not hesitant to open for us. When we reached the clinic we were pleased to see their facility, which had a small play area for kids, a small dental reclining chair that kids would love, and a monitor fixed to the ceiling just above the recling chair where they played cartoon of our Kid's choice to keep them engaged.

We remember that you had been to few other dental clinics before visiting us who could not handle the 4 year old child. We at microsmiles, despite being our official holiday, opened the clinic on your request since the child was in pain and treated her successfully with 2 root canals. We informed you that the fillings done were only a temporary solution and caps has to be done for both. We also insisted that you get the CAP done for the root canal treated teeth, however you denied it and asked us to just leave it with a simple filling. At this point we had clearly mentioned that this was not a definite solution and they wouldn‚Äôt last for more than 3-5 days, and that a cap for the 2 root canal treated teeth will be necessary. At the end of the treatment, the bill payment debacle could have been avoided since a written consent for payment of Rs 9000/- was taken before starting the treatment itself.  At Microsmiles we aim at patient satisfaction and best treatment outcomes. The child friendly environment that we have has been designed to provide the best dental experience for a child. Please understand that we provided you with the best Pediatric dental treatment available across our country and relentless bargaining for mere 500/- was unwarranted.
