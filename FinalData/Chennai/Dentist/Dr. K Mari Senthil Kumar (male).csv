"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"I should say that I was very fortunate to see Dr. Mari Senthilkumar for my dental cavity problem few days back. 

Actually, I had consulted another doctor before and was advised Root Canal Treatment (RCT) followed by having a dental crown for fixing my deep cavity. Obviously, that treatment will involve lot of money and multiple visits to the doctor.

But Dr. Mari Senthilkumar offered me to treat my problem conservatively first with a composite filling and said only if there are any issues, I have to go for the RCT and the Crown later. Within 45 minutes, he completed the permanent composite filling without much pain and also showed me clear pictures of my tooth before and after the procedure. The cost was also very nominal compared to other doctors. So far, I do not have any issues after the filling and feeling normal as the cavity is gone now.

So, I highly recommend this doctor to anyone having any dental problems for a correct diagnosis and also for a cost effective *** **** ********* in a city like Chennai.
