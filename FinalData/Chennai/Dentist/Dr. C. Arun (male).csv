      I'm glad that you brought it to my notice. Dental treatment to a kid below 5years is the toughest , not that the procedure is difficult but the child will be very anxious about any dental procedure  when we put on gloves and face masks. It takes a lot of time to do even a single filling.

 Where your kid had more than 6 fillings to be done , i informed the patients attender about one filling cost  and the number of fillings to be done. The attender asked me to do the needful for the rest of the teeth also. 

Not that treatment itself is costlier, the number of procedures done is also matters !!! 

I'm happy that I have rectified your kids dental problem at ease
