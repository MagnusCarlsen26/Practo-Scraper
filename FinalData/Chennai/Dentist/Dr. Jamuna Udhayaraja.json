I forced him many times and finally decided to meet Dr. Udhayaraja about this. He was very polite and helping my father to understand his situation and explained very clearly about his procedure. That gave the confidence and made my father very comfortable. After meeting this doctor, my father finally accepted and he is with his new teeth now !! :) I would like to thank Dr. Udhayaraja and Dr. Jamuna for the excellent service. I have to mention the office staff as well! They were very humble in answering the phone whenever we call them for any queries. Thank you again! ",

That gave the confidence and made my father very comfortable. After meeting this doctor, my father finally accepted and he is with his new teeth now !! :) I would like to thank Dr. Udhayaraja and Dr. Jamuna for the excellent service. I have to mention the office staff as well! They were very humble in answering the phone whenever we call them for any queries. Thank you again! ",
