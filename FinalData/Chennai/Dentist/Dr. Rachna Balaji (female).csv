"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,NO,"I visited Dr.Rachna for the first time on 2nd May 2019. On the first day, she scanned the particular tooth I was facing issues with, took an X-ray and proceeded with cleaning the tooth. She asked me to come for RCT the next day. Before starting with the treatment, she told it usually takes 20 to 30 mins for RCT and it is not painful. Believe me, she took more than 2 hours and I had to ask her to stop with the procedure since I was not able to bear the sensitivity. I explained her my issue n number of times to which she angrily replied - if you do not cooperate, I will not be able to continue with the treatment and will call someone else... and continued drilling. After a while I desperately asked her to stop and her response to my request was -  had it been a public clinic nobody would have listened but since it is a private clinic I am accepting your request because for us your comfort is a priority. She called someone up and explained what I was going through. That someone advised her to use Articaine ****** *** *** *** ***** *** told her that I might be a case of hot tooth or hot pulp. She gave an open cotton dressing and asked me to come the next day. I obviously did not dare to go.
