  Good to hear from you after 3 months of your visit.when you visited here you presented serious symptoms which were(Feeling like Lump in cheek,Pain in joints of jaw,Burning sensation in tongue and Pain in gums). 
When we examined your mouth you had lot of deposits in your gums which where unhealthy and even showed you in the intra-oral camera and proceeded with cleaning on your approval.Just not to ignore your serious complaints and to take a safe call we suggested you for investigation of complete intra oral x - rays (As some serious bony lesion and wisdom tooth infections can remain hidden).As soon as we saw the X-ray we assured you that 100 % nothing serious and recommended diet modification and all your symptoms will be gone.
After cleaning we screened you again and found eight cavities for which estimate given was just (600-1000) per tooth depending on how deep the decay inside tooth and also told decay is a very slow process for you to get symptom and its always better to get it  done early more like a preventive approach and never urged to do it immediately all at once.
    we here guide to resolve your cavity issue at the earliest stage itself permanently with a simple advanced european standard dental filling rather to wait and do delayed as may lead to sensitivity with fillings at advanced decay stages and the risk of tooth going to root canal treatment is also more.Hope you found a better place and good luck with it.And the gum issues u had would have resolved with our cleaning treatment itself and no dentist will say cleaning of teeth professionally called as scaling is unwanted and is highly recommended to get it done once in every six months.
