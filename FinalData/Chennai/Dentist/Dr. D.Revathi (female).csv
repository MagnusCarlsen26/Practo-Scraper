Myself and my wife visited this clinic based on strong recommendations from my mother and friends for Dr. Revathi is friendly care and  knowledge. 

But we were hesitant initially about Root Canal and Wisdom tooth extraction and sutures as it involves lots of pain due to past experiences. 

We've been there and hardly was there 5 minutes of wait time. 

Dr. Revathi is friendly and smiling always. 
Cost is reasonable. 
Not money but service minded doctor. 

My wife spoke about the past experience in root canal treatment from another doctor, who also broke the tooth and caused much pain. 

But Dr. Revathi handled it in 12 minutes with no pain, to our surprise and comfort. 

I was frightened of wisdom tooth extraction but she handled it well, and surgeon who took off my tooth was very cooperative and explanative as well which helped me to handle after treatment care well. 

X-rays and tests are all done in house, all at one place.
