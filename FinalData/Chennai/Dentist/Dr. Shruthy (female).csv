"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Impaction / Impacted Tooth Extraction,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Dr Shruthy is truly a modern day professional. Got the exact diagnoses without knowing my history during the first consultation. Xray was advised and surgery was planned and explained to me very clearly and was done two days later. 

After a year or so of being afraid to get my decaying wisdom teeth removed, was finally able to get it done. I felt no pain during the process and the instructions given post surgery helped me recover and be at ease. Made two visits to clinic after surgery. Post surgery follow up and care at this clinic and by the Dr is great. 

Staff is very friendly and the clinic is clean. Will recommend Shruthy and True Dental Care to people I know. Especially ones who are scared to go to a dentist.

My first appointment was smooth and Doctor explained clearly what needs to be done and recommended for the wisdom tooth removal as it was giving me lot of pain.

Never in my lifetime I had to go thru tooth extraction and I was very afraid of the procedure but Doctor Shruthy gave me the right confidence for the procedure and I ended up taking not one but two teeth‚Äôs :-) To be honest I had zero pain during the whole procedure and I am so grateful to my doctor.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,I was quite surprised when the doctor mentioned such pocket friendly fee for tooth extraction and cleaning. Common on..we live in a day and age where we pay 1000 just for a pedicure whilst for the gruesome tartar deposit cleaning and scaling the doctor charged just Rs 800. My wisdom tooth was too brittle and had to be broken into pieces for extraction. The doctor again spent almost an hour fighting with the decayed tooth and pulled it out reassuring me every minute that it was going to be alright.
