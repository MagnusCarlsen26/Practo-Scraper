"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Artificial Teeth,Dental X-Ray,Bleeding Gums Treatment,Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,Periodontal Flap Surgery,",0,0,YES," We first got introduced as patients --alongwith -----continued also as  friendship bondage---- for more than 27 years  .We always feel secured under his care and treatment.We regard Dr  Chelliah Venkatraman as one of our family members --more than a doctor.  It can be said that he has created a space among the  masses to feel protected under a dentist for dental problems and to   wipe out  the general  opinion that a dentist  will always be known for extraction or replacement of tooth.He treats patients with total care and the most important thing is his positive approach which greatly helps the patients.In this regard We ,all our family members 
 feel very happy and lucky too!! It is needless to say he is very friendly and very efficient doctor who treats patients with patience full care ,and service mindedness.Though he is the Chief of the hospital he is always approachable which indicates the positivity between the patients and the doctors.Doctor Venkatraman is having a wonderful efficient team of doctors with him.We do recommend and suggest that for any dental problem people can approach PARASU for the best solution with remedy.We wish the DRVenkatraman to achieve many more and more success in the field .ThankYou somuch doctor and wishing PARASU all hte best to achieve still more success!!!
