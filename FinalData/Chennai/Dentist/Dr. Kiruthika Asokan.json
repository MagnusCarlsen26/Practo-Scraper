Their staff is predominantly awesome, and what they do best is to create a hospitable environment to all guest. \n\nClean and up to date facility also plenty of parking. Scheduling an appointment is a breeze with a very communicable receptionist team ensuring you get your reminders.\n\nDr. Devis always greets with a friendly smile and takes an interest in your life outside of the office. He takes his professionalism seriously and will provide you his best recommendations. With any procedure you take on, his goal is to make it as comfortable and painless as possible. He takes pride in what he does. \n The experience has been an absolute joy. Myself had severe crowding, an overbite and teeth were coming in in front of other teeth. Our Dentist told me when I was 10 years old that I would need braces and Dr. Devis and his team make the entire process something to look forward to. We have been kept well informed of current progress and anticipated progress and what to expect next. The office is happy to answer any questions and are just as pleased with her progress as we are. The office has a nice atmosphere, there\u2019s never a long wait from your appointment time until you see the doctor, the staff are always pleasant and happy and Dr. Devis always takes the time to talk about progress and answer questions. I could see the difference in my teeth within the first two months. Apart from the healthy mouth and teeth benefits, having braces has helped me to improve my self confidence. I had stopped smiling with my mouth open before I got my braces on, I had stopped smiling much at all really, and within days of getting my braces on I started smiling with my mouth open again and has not stopped. \n\nAgain, I want to thank your friendly staff for accommodating my needs and always taking good care of me.\n",

She recommends only what is required and nothing extra .I had gone to Doctor for tooth gap filling , I had straight teeth without any gap but in past few years , the gap between the tooth had widened significantly, it made me insecure . Elsewhere , I was suggested to fill the gap with cement - a costly & not a permanent fix . I'm so glad I didn't take up the suggestion. \nDr.  Kiruthika is particular about identifying the root of the problem and explaining the treatment procedure succinctly to the patient ,questioning  is strongly encouraged and detailed answers are given by her. I followed Doc's advise of wearing removable metal braces regularly and with a painless laser procedure ( attention to the root cause of teeth gap ) , my teeth gap has reduced visibly in a matter of 4-5 months , this was much earlier  than what I had anticipated! \nThanks to Doc , I can now  smile without any hesitation.  \nI also thank Doc &  team for maintaining a friendly & comforting atmosphere and wish them the best.",

Dr. Davis fixed it with perfection and i had absolutely no pain in the entire treatment. Now my teeth are perfectly aligned just how i wanted it to be. I would like to thank all the staffs and nurses present at the clinic because they made sure that i don't miss my appointments.

She gave me two options. One is temporary treatment cleaning my tooth cavity and filling, which is cost wise low compared to permanent treatment. The permanent treatment is to do root canal and fix tooth cap. I was frightened but she clearly explained about both the procedure. She asked me to take temporary treatment first if it does not ease the pain then we can go for the permanent treatment. I opted for the root canal treatment. It was less painful and the cost was also  reasonable when  compared to other clinics. I am really happy with her treatment. She gave the exact match of tooth cap for my treated tooth. Thank you very much ma'am.\n-Vaishnavi Vijayaraghavan.",

I was very much worried and confused whether to extract the tooth or go for rct and I had no trust on the dentists whom we had consulted earlier pertaining to dental issues. So by practo, I went to this doctor, waited patiently, looking at happy patients. Then we were asked to to meet her, and after some intros, we were astonished to listen to her, as She examined and told us one by one the treatments which we had done earlier and condemned us for not taking proper care. The magic is within few minutes we gained total confidence that our issue will be resolved and told to proceed as she prefers. This was because she was so down to earth, humble, kind and ethical, and not a person who will go back on her words.  Second she explained in detail the issue and the process which we will undergo and infact she made us decide ourselves by understanding the pros and cons.  The next moment when I came out I was out of burden and cancelled going for another opinion. But due to ifs and buts of my parents I consulted several other experts and felt confident in her method. Finally, family gave us the right remedy and we are highly thankful to Dr. Krithika Asokan her for helping us do the right thing. In fact, if anyone asks us for a dentist we shall recommend them to consult her.",

Because of this problem i was feeling bad and uncomfort while eating. So i contacted the doctor who gave some instruction about causes and effect of non-removal of wisdom tooth. Finally i accepted to remove my wisdom tooth. One of my wisdom teeth was removed first. I was feeling pain around that teeth 2 days. After that there is no pain. During treatment period, all staffs were treated me as a family member/ well wisher not like a patient. Thank you doctors  for your best treatment. Thank you all.\n\nInitially i was thinking that there will be a pain long time after the treatment so i was afraid to take treatment. But really there is no pain. After this extraction of my first teeth, all fear was gone since their treatment is excellent and was not painful.\n\nThank god for giving such a good polite and caring doctors and friends. ",

We used to follow a protocol that we will say treatment charges before starting the procedure or treatment . If you are not interested you could have stopped with your consultation alone. Nothing can be done without your acceptance.  Charges are varies depending upon many factors like experience, type of problem,type of material etc... \n\n2.Your second reason shows that you have not communicated with doctors regarding the X-ray. Then how come you are expecting immediate response from the doctor.\n\n3. We are having a power point presentation for the crown (tooth cap) types and models. We will show this to patients before starting the preparation. We can explain only if they come directly for the appointment. But you missed out the time slot for the cap preparation. Will you expect us to come to your home and do explain???\n\nAnd we always ready to give our time to do good service who believe us!!!",

I went to Dr. Kiruthika Asokan's clinic at Porur to fill my upper tooth without having confidence that it would not last long. Because the previous filling lasted only for one  week which I did in another clinic .why, when I consulted in a reputed dental clinic they advised me to remove my tooth. But after I filled my tooth and cleaned my teeth, I'm totally happy and trouble  free. Thank you. I'm  71years old and my both the parents were doctors. I'm Hale and healthy because my body is the most precious thing in my life.                The Dr is friendly and considerate. The clinic is neat and tidy. It has modern costly equipments. Thank you.                  ",

Since root canal treatment is a long process, we fixed an appointment for you at 5:30PM and for another patient at 6:00 PM. But, you reached our clinic only at 6:15PM. So we had to finish the consultation of the second patient, who arrived punctually at her fixed appointment time. We had to finish up with the treatment of the second patient before starting your treatment. We hope this doesn't happen again and we kindly request you to be punctual with respect to fixed appointments.All our appointments got delay for 45 mts and our clinic closing time too extended. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nRegards,\nTeam Family Clinic",
