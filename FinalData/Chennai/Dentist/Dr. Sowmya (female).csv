"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Crowns,Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Sowmya has been nothing but professional. She identified the issues immediately and explained the procedure and the costs involved.  Am grateful for her diagnosis and regular follow ups. I have never had to wait for too long. 

The Doctor who did the RCT was also very professional and tried to make the process as painless as possible. I got another couple of teeth extracted the following month and again the doctor that did the procedure was very kind and tried to minimise the pain as much as possible. Dr Sowmya has been very kind and friendly through out the treatment. Will definitely recommend Dr. Sowmya and Glow Dental.  ",2024-07-22 13:44:37,False,True,Ravi anand.K,,,
