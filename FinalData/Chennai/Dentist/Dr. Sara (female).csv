,,0,0,YES,"Very calm and patient. Listens to your problems and gives you the best treatment and advice . I had severe pain in my molar, which was  caused due to my wisdom tooth . The extraction was done smoothly and the healing process was very smooth . I have heard people getting rashes but it was done precisely and with least pain.
