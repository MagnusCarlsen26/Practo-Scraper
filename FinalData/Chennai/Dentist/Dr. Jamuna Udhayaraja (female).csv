None,None,0,0,YES,"I am posting this on behalf of my father who is approaching 70 yrs now.He was not comfortable and literally scared to extract his teeth and to implant both upper and lower jaw. I forced him many times and finally decided to meet Dr. Udhayaraja about this. He was very polite and helping my father to understand his situation and explained very clearly about his procedure. That gave the confidence and made my father very comfortable.
