"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dentofacial Orthopedics,",0,0,YES,"Although dental clinics have sprung up in every nook and cranny, Dew Cosmetic Clinic was founded after researching where to find the best treatment. After a lot of searching for a reliable and experienced clinic for dental treatment, I came to Dr Subashini Roubans Dew Cosmetic Clinic for my  dental treatment and the wart removal of my daughter. The clinic is located on the 1st floor opposite Devi Flats near Devi Academy School in Chennai Valasaravakkam. Treatment is done here by proper prior  appointment

Everyone‚Äôs interactions starting from the receptionist were very charming and cordial.
Dr. Subashini is a gem of a person who explained everything in detail about the treatment. She too explained the positive and negative side of the treatment. After explaining in great detail, treatment begins. They use the latest technology available in dental treatment and more. The treatment is very careful and takes time in several stages. The highlight of this clinic is the laser-assisted smile procedure, which attractively presents unsightly rows of teeth. 

The speciality of this place is that the necessary scanning tests are done at every stage of the treatment under the supervision of Dr. Subashini and it gives the best results. Dr. Subashini Reuban is one of the leading Dentofacial Cometic Experts with more years of experience in Chennai. Many patients from abroad often come for the treatment.

Even artificial teeth made of zirconia like natural teeth are designed in the best labs in India and used in the clinic for best results. They are not compromised at any stage to get the best results.
