None,None,0,0,YES,"I consulted Arun for teeth whitening and fixing the gap between my incisors teeth. Arun explained the options available in detail and with great patience. I was in Chennai only for a few days and he expedited his treatment upon my request and made it very flexible. The end result was fantabulous and I was 100% satisfied with Arun’s smile design solutions. I had never in my life smiled with so much confidence, thanks to Arun I don’t have to be self conscious while smiling any more ! It’s been a month since I got my smile design procedure done and I haven’t felt any discomfort or problems with my teeth caps. The clinic itself is well maintained with positive vibes. The staffs and support doctors are very friendly and flexible with patient’s needs. The only thing that I felt could be improved is the timing.  My appointments were always delayed by 15-30 mins. It’s understandable for a clinic and I didn’t have an issue since I was on a holiday but might be frustrating for office goers. Oh and I never felt a teeny tiny bit of pain during the entire procedure ( I had to take 8 injections in my gums at one point Ha Ha !)",2021-12-29 01:56:14,False,True,Anirudh,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Doctor Arun Suraj is always explains the problem and ensures we understand the issue and the treatment options available. The root canal treatments are done by him personally, wherever needed, he ensures specialists are invited to perform the surgery. The staffs are also friendly and flexible with the appointments.
He answers all our questions patiently. For all my dental issues, i prefer to visit 32 pearls only - either Velachery or Perungudi based on my convenience.

None,None,0,0,NO,"We reviewed in Google and choosen Arun suraj based on the number of years the experience he has, but after arriving we got treated by another doctor who looks very junior by the age. No complaints about the doctor we met. But we asked for appointment with Doctor Arun suraj, not with someone else. If we known we not gonna treated by Arun suraj, we would have opted some other senior dentist. So please give clear information about the doctor we going to meet.",2023-12-12 15:36:30,False,False,Prabhakaran R,,,
