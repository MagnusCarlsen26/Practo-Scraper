None,None,0,0,YES,"Mr. Jebin Paul Nesaline is a warm and friendly dentist. It has been 2 weeks since I had my wisdom tooth removed and he has been constantly in touch with me while I recover. Last Monday (about a week after the surgery), he'd asked me to pay him a visit just to check how the healing has been. 

I'd recommend Mr. Jebin to anyone who likes a touch of care and humaneness in a doctor.
