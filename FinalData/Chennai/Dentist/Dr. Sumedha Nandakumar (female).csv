"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Full Mouth Rehabilitation,",0,0,YES,"I am Ekambaram, 68 years old, was requiring a Full Mouth Rehabilitation, as I was suffering with many dental issues for years. I gone into right hands, Dr Nandakumar and Dr Sumedha Nandakumar of Sai Faciomaxillary & Dental Centre, where my treatment was scheduled for about two months, with 15-16 sittings. Today, I returned to my 40s, with a complete cure of all my ailments. 

I appreciate the excellent professional service rendered by Dr Sumedha, Dr Sivaranjani and their team and I adore their focussed attention in treating me. The clinic is well maintained and conforming to NABH standards, which demands customised care and total satisfaction of the patients.

The ambiance of the clinic is so cozy, and highly hygienic with premier interiors. The Clinic is fully equipped with latest and updated equipments, with the state-of-art technology, where the patients will get an international treatment at Indian cost.

At the Reception, Ms Fathima is so courteous to the patients, ensures they are regularly followed up, fix the appointments and makes them meeting the doctors, without any long waiting. I saw her, as a multi-tasking girl with good administration skills.

I could find Dr. Sumedha, never compromises, on the quality of her treatment, as well the accessories she uses, for her patients. Dr Sivaranjani, is a good support to the doctors and a good learner. Overall, I had and an awesome experience, through their personal care and painless treatment. 

Infact, they donâ€™t look for the Patientsâ€™ satisfaction, but for a â€˜Patientsâ€™ Delightâ€™, where untold requirements of the patients are also addressed and given right solutions. 

Sai Faciomaxillary & Dental Centre, is the best destination for the dental issues of any sort, on a most competitive cost as on date, in Chennai, as of now.
