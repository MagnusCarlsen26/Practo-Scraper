He is committed to 'no pain' treatments and even though I used to hate going to the dentist growing up, now a visit to Mark's clinic is a peaceful experience with no expectation of pain or trauma. Dr. Mark also has a great eye for cosmetic adjustments that need to be made, he knows exactly how to enhance your smile while still keeping a natural look. He uses only the latest technology and best products and his pricing is very fair. Overall would recommend Dr. Mark 100% ",

Since then Dr. Mark has been treating me for the past 8 years. He is extremely patient and kind, answering all queries and explaining all procedures in detail before starting any procedure. He is committed to 'no pain' treatments and even though I used to hate going to the dentist growing up, now a visit to Mark's clinic is a peaceful experience with no expectation of pain or trauma. Dr. Mark also has a great eye for cosmetic adjustments that need to be made, he knows exactly how to enhance your smile while still keeping a natural look. He uses only the latest technology and best products and his pricing is very fair. Overall would recommend Dr. Mark 100% ",
