"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"My name is S Mahalingam, retired from the Airports Authority of India and I am  aged 83 years and a resident of  Ashok Nagar, Chennai. About 15 to 20 years back - when I was in my middle sixties - I developed some tooth problem: two of my teeth on the lower jaw had  decayed and required attention, possibly extraction. I then came to know that  a fairly new procedure termed "" Root Canal Treatment "" had come into practice wherein the treatment is done without extracting the decayed tooth. Then a co-resident in my flat complex suggested that I consult Dr N Venkatesan who he said is a very competent dentist.  I immediately sought and got an appointment with Dr.N.Venkatesan whose clinic is located fairly close to my residence. After examining my teeth as expected he suggested root canal treatment. He fully explained the modalities of that treatment. I agreed and he took up and completed the treatment for both the decayed teeth in about a week's time His fees were also very reasonable.I suffered absolutely no undue inconvenience or discomfort either during the treatment period or subsequent days and I was fully satisfied.
    In the subsequent few years my other teeth decayed progressively due to age. and Dr Venkatesan administrated the same root canal treatment. Until in a period of 4 or 5 years all my teeth both in the upper and lower jaws had been covered by that treatment. The treatment was fully satisfactory and there were absolutely no complications. His fees were also eminently reasonable. 
  Then. after that for over many years I had absolutely no problem regarding my teeth. I could eat well, even hard substances like nuts or murruku.Based on my experience with him many of my relatives have also become his patients.
    Dr. N.Venkatesan's "" Venkaterwara Laser Dental Clinic and Implant Centre"" is located at an easily accessible place near the Ranganathan Subway. It is equipped with state-of-art dental equipment. Dr. Venkatesan is a Cosmetic, Dental Surgeon,
Prosthodontist and Oral Implantologist, highly qualified with a string of academic degrees. He treats his patients with consideration and confidence and one suffers no tension when undergoing treatment under him
His fees are also moderate.

in need of dental treatment
