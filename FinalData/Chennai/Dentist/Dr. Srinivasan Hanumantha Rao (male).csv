"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,It is a plesant experience with Spark Dental care of Dr.Srinivas Rao.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental X-Ray,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I am 69, type2 diabetic and have a phobia of visiting a dentist for fear of pain. 
Thanks to Dr H. Srinivasan, for I'm free from the phobia, for I never felt the pain while cleaning the teeth nor extracting a loosened wisdom tooth by him. 
The relaxed ambience and the soothing lounge music and the genial behaviour of the doctors in the Sparks Dental Centre is commendable.
