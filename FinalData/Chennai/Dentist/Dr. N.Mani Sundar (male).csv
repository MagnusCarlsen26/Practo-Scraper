None,"Toothache,",0,0,Yes,"Doctor has a thorough professional approach in decision making. In practice also, he exhibited the same class, in the sense that tooth extraction was painless, within minutes without any struggle, he swiftly did the extraction..  Credit should equally go to the assistant Doctors he has in his panel  who did the work of cleaning the teeth in the most efficient and painless manner.  Ambience is good. Why not I give him a FIVE STAR RATING. I rate his work with Five Stars.  Wish him, he continues in the same manner in the years to come.   __ A.GOPAL
