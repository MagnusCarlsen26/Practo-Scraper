"Doctor friendliness,","Braces,",0,0,YES,"Highest recommendation for Dr. Kiruthika and his team here at Family Multi specialty and Dental Clinic.


I live 150 miles away from his dental office but that doesn't stop me from returning. Their staff is predominantly awesome, and what they do best is to create a hospitable environment to all guest. 

Clean and up to date facility also plenty of parking. Scheduling an appointment is a breeze with a very communicable receptionist team ensuring you get your reminders.

Dr. Devis always greets with a friendly smile and takes an interest in your life outside of the office. He takes his professionalism seriously and will provide you his best recommendations. With any procedure you take on, his goal is to make it as comfortable and painless as possible. He takes pride in what he does. 
 The experience has been an absolute joy. Myself had severe crowding, an overbite and teeth were coming in in front of other teeth. Our Dentist told me when I was 10 years old that I would need braces and Dr. Devis and his team make the entire process something to look forward to. We have been kept well informed of current progress and anticipated progress and what to expect next. The office is happy to answer any questions and are just as pleased with her progress as we are. The office has a nice atmosphere, there‚Äôs never a long wait from your appointment time until you see the doctor, the staff are always pleasant and happy and Dr. Devis always takes the time to talk about progress and answer questions. I could see the difference in my teeth within the first two months. Apart from the healthy mouth and teeth benefits, having braces has helped me to improve my self confidence. I had stopped smiling with my mouth open before I got my braces on, I had stopped smiling much at all really, and within days of getting my braces on I started smiling with my mouth open again and has not stopped. 

Again, I want to thank your friendly staff for accommodating my needs and always taking good care of me.

Dr.  Kiruthika is particular about identifying the root of the problem and explaining the treatment procedure succinctly to the patient ,questioning  is strongly encouraged and detailed answers are given by her. I followed Doc's advise of wearing removable metal braces regularly and with a painless laser procedure ( attention to the root cause of teeth gap ) , my teeth gap has reduced visibly in a matter of 4-5 months , this was much earlier  than what I had anticipated!

Dr. Kiruthika Asokan's experience reflects in the way she educates the patient on the cause of the problem and the treatment that is required.

The key points that impressed me was
- No unnecessary / expensive medicines were prescribed.
- Appointments were scheduled and proper follow-up was given.

- Family friendly environment.

2.The X - Rays taken by the doctor were not given immediately.I was told by the staff to collect them at the end of treatment.It was not professional to hold the x-rays even after paying for them.

3.The Dentist did not explain the option for the teeth cap.Instead simply mentioned the cost for the cap.I came to know through a different dentist that there are 4 options available for tooth cap .I did only scaling ,filling and Root canal with this dentist.I choose a different dentist for the teeth cap.

Anyhow I will post the reply for others to understand! 

1. We used to follow a protocol that we will say treatment charges before starting the procedure or treatment . If you are not interested you could have stopped with your consultation alone. Nothing can be done without your acceptance.  Charges are varies depending upon many factors like experience, type of problem,type of material etc... 

2.Your second reason shows that you have not communicated with doctors regarding the X-ray. Then how come you are expecting immediate response from the doctor.

3. We are having a power point presentation for the crown (tooth cap) types and models. We will show this to patients before starting the preparation. We can explain only if they come directly for the appointment. But you missed out the time slot for the cap preparation. Will you expect us to come to your home and do explain???

Since root canal treatment is a long process, we fixed an appointment for you at 5:30PM and for another patient at 6:00 PM. But, you reached our clinic only at 6:15PM. So we had to finish the consultation of the second patient, who arrived punctually at her fixed appointment time. We had to finish up with the treatment of the second patient before starting your treatment. We hope this doesn't happen again and we kindly request you to be punctual with respect to fixed appointments.All our appointments got delay for 45 mts and our clinic closing time too extended. üòä
