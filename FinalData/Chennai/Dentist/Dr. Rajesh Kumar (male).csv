"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Crowns,",0,0,YES,"I recently got my wisdom teeth removed and also underwent a root canal procedure. I was really anxious about the process and the pain. Dr. Rajesh and his team were extremely friendly and made me super comfortable during the procedure. I did not experience any discomfort during the procedure. He patiently cleared all my queries.

The ambience is very hygienic. Follow-ups post-procedure made me more confident on the path to recovery. Furthermore, my mother underwent a tooth extraction procedure, and she is doing well now. Thank you so much, Dr.Rajesh.
Overall, great and exceptional service.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,",0,0,YES," I visited Doctor on 13th March 2024. The capping-built like a bridge, done 3 decades ago,  of late kept coming off.  Eager to get it set right, concerned at the same time  of what will this involve, cost and time involved. Having a 2+ month baby at home, these concerns were prominent. Went with my Spouse. We found the following as huge Plus Points:                               
 1) wait time: was Zero. We were attended on the time of Appointment.
2) Friendliness: Doctor has a way of engaging. Enquires about the  family,  small talk, listens with attention.  All these facilitate the Patient to relax and get ready for the process  that will be next.  
3)  Explanation of the issues: Doctor explained the material used for capping will have to change. Made a fix with a resin that will hold on for few months to come. 
4) Value gained:  I do not know what the Doctor gained.... but grateful the way he understands the concerns unspoken and billed in a way that the temporary setting will pull through the period. The cost was very minimal. Also, shared the aspects, that need to be attended as soon as possible.  Our Best Wishes to Doctor and his Family...
