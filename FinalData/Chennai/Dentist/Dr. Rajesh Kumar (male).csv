None,"Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"       I was very happy when I went to Thangam Clinic. Good ambience. Doctor is very kind and hospitable. I did not wait at all. As per appointment I was attended.No waste of time.The doctor takes the complete medical history and medication meticulously,before going into the diagnosis. Doctor gives a patient hearing .His advises before and after the procedure very good.During the procedure he treats the patient with extra care to make the patient feel at home.  In my case I did not feel any pain during the procedure.The follow up by the doctor after treatment is commendable.He has a good set of assistants. Even though I  am far from the clinic ,despite being old I still like to visit Thangam clinic  for any tooth problem.you go with pain and return with no pain. I have no hesitation in recommending Dr. Rajesh Kumaar.      for any dental problem.


God's Blessings  to everyone.
