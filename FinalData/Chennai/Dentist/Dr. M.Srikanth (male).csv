"Explanation of the health issue,","Dental Fillings,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"How did I find Dr. M. Srikanth?
■ After many days of searches in the Practo app for a dentist, I found Dr. M. Srikanth profile; he is a dentist, prosthodontist, cosmetic/aestheticist, and implantologist. He mentioned in his profile that he has well-rounded experience, as follows:

1. RCT (Root Canel Treatment)
2. Smile Design
3. Orthodontic treatment
4. Laser gum surgery 
5. Laser Dentistry
6. Dental implant fixing
7. Porcelain inlays and onlays
8. Cosmetic makeovers
9. General dentistry
10. RCT (single sitting)
11. Scaling/Polishing
12. Orthodontics
13. Pulpectomy
14. Dental X-ray
15. Dental Crowns

My teeth issue:

The molar tooth was infected. I went to other dentists earlier. They didn't follow the filling procedure properly. So the molar tooth was heavily infected after a few years.

Treatment:

I visited the Smile Solutions clinic after viewing the Dr. M. Srikanth profile in Practo. The doctor advised me to extract the tooth and do an implant. I told him to save the tooth. Then the doctor started the root canal treatment. The doctor told me that it would take 3 weeks to complete. Because of the heavy infection. In between 3 weeks, the doctor identified other decayed teeth and recommended filling, which was completed. Also, the doctor advised me to do a deep cleaning.

The doctor told me that the infection is reduced and the RCT tooth is ready for further procedures. Such as accessing and cleaning the roots, drilling through the tooth to access the root canals and pulp chamber, shaping the canals, filling the canals, filling the access hole, and healing. Once it was completed, the doctor grinded the tooth to measure the crown.

The doctor explained to me about crown types and the cost of the crown. Metal crown, porcelain fused metal crown, all-ceramic crown, CAD/CAM zirconia crown. I chose the CAD/CAM zirconia crown. Zirconia crowns are incredibly strong and resistant to fracture. With proper oral care and regular visits to the dentist, zirconia crowns can easily last 15 to 20 years. Now everything is fine. Let's see what happens in the future.

Actually, before every visit to the clinic, I studied about cleaning, cleaning instruments, filling, filling materials, deep cleaning, root canel treatment, RCT procedures, types of crowns, and which crown is giving more life. Also, cost comparison with other dentists for each treatment. That's why I didn't discuss much about treatment with the doctors in the Smile Solutions dental clinic. The cost for each treatment is reasonable at the Smile Solution dental clinic. The output is fantastic. Dr. M. Srikanth is very friendly. The way other doctors and assistants treated me was great. I am recommending this doctor for dental patients.

None,"Dental Cleaning,",0,0,NO,"Visited the doctor as I had toothpain, consultation was done, but no diagnosis sheet was provided. Xray was taken but only the digital copy was sent to my phone. 
During consultation, I was told nothing is wrong with all the teeth and there was a lot of plaque and cleaning the plaque might help reduce the pain and the cost for cleaning would be 1000rs. 

When I went for the actual procedure, they mentioned I'd require deep cleaning and it will cost 8000rs. Post which I'll need to do laser treatment and have my cavities filled.

Thanks for your feedback. 
We just wanted to make some clarifications.
 As you had mentioned in your feedback you don't have any dental issues which we could relate  your chief complaint which was severe pain, so we had asked you to come after 10 days for cleaning your plaque and deposits.
 Sir u required deep scaling as you are getting your tooth cleaned after several years. 
 Sir you reported after 10 days with no pain for deep cleaning,We had discussion regarding the procedure and the costing and with your consent first session of deep scaling was performed with local anaesthesia.
  After cleaning we could find some cavities below the region where you had plaque earlier and we showed you the cavities and suggested you to get them filled within few months. 
  During your next visit you raised your concern regarding cost and wanted the procedure to be done for the cost you preferred. 
  You had asked for x-rays , which we have sent by mail. Now since you are asking for summary, we will arrange for that one too.

I always had this fear of going to dental clinics due to the painful procedures that we have to undergo. But believe me, I can't wait for my next appointment and get my tooth treated completely. It relies solely on the doctor and the clinic's hospitality. Dr.Srikanth thoroughly checks his patient and he doesn't leave his patient behind. Everyday I used to get call from smile solutions and they check me upon my comfortableness on the procedure undergone and check upon my pain. I have never been under this kind of thoughtful treatment before. I am really thankful to Dr.Srikanth and Smile solutions staff's for taking care of my dental health.

First his clinic has all modern equipment then he clearly shows your mouth on screen then explains what needs to be done . Once you are completely clear he will start.
Last month I was on an abroad trip and I happened to develop a Mucocele. I consulted GP then another OMS there and they asked me to get operated.
I shared photos with Dr.Srikanth and he was kind enough to have them seen personally and I spoke to him and he gave me initial OTC gargle for temp relief and also the day I arrived I was operated without any wait.
Mind you it was a Sunday but due to my issue he was ready with another surgeon.
Also he himself called me up by evening to check how I was doing..
I find all traits in him which we expect from a doc.

Regarding your no visits for root canal,yours was a retreatment condition with seperated instrument, which usually takes more no of visits.

We would like to share ours. 

You are visiting us for 3 rd opinion sir
Your have a complaint of mild sensitivity with no cavity and no abnormal findings in x-rays. 

Previous doctors suggested root canal in some teeth .you were not happy with that suggestion .

Even we couldn't find any decay or reason for your pain clinically and in x rays.
so we suggested you wait for 2 weeks b4 deciding on the treatment and to take it slow.you are not happy with us either and you say that we couldn't diagnose .

Sir doctor Srikanth had a discussion for 10 minutes where you showed previous 5 x rays and all the previous doctors prescriptions/records.

Sir please don't expect doctors who are on proper PPE to sit with u and talk to u for 30 mins.
