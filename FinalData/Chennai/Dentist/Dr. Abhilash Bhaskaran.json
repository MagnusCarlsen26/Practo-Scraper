He instills such a deep confidence because of his simple, straightforward explanations of every issue and treatment. I had been recommended teeth straightening all my life but only after my husband went through a tooth extraction with Dr Abhilash is when I found someone completely trustworthy. I got my braces at his clinic even though it is a bit far for me and I have multiple options at walking distance from my home. Recently when my 5 year old needed some fillings, we went to Dr Abhilash again. It was such a smooth process because even my daughter trusted him and formed a bond with him, all because of his calm, soothing and friendly manner. I keep recommending him to everyone I know and I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for any kind of dental/maxillofacial treatment. Even if you have to travel a bit, it is completely worth!",

He instills such a deep confidence because of his simple, straightforward explanations of every issue and treatment. I had been recommended teeth straightening all my life but only after my husband went through a tooth extraction with Dr Abhilash is when I found someone completely trustworthy. I got my braces at his clinic even though it is a bit far for me and I have multiple options at walking distance from my home. Recently when my 5 year old needed some fillings, we went to Dr Abhilash again. It was such a smooth process because even my daughter trusted him and formed a bond with him, all because of his calm, soothing and friendly manner. I keep recommending him to everyone I know and I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for any kind of dental/maxillofacial treatment. Even if you have to travel a bit, it is completely worth!",

                "review_text": "As an expat I had no-one to recommend a dentist, which was unfortunate as I needed some Root Canal work. Checking on the internet I found Dr. Abhilash Bhaskaran whose practice was just around the corner from where I live and who had spent several years practicing in the UK. Do not be put off by the rather nondescript block of flats where he has his clinic as his surgery is fully modernized. And I am very pleased to say that (as far as visits to the dentists ever can be) that this was far from a bad experience. Dr. Abhilash talked me through what was required, always made sure that I was comfortable and worked with great competence. All in all I was impressed with his work and would thoroughly recommend him.",
