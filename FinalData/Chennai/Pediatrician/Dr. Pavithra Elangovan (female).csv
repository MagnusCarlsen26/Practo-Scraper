,,0,0,YES,Initially we went for dysentery issue for my 4.5 yrs baby girl along with intense  stomach pain. Doctor was so friendly and she gave correct medications and also she gave confidence to be calm as dysentery will not stop suddenly but it can take 2-3 days to completely become normal. And she was checking with us regularly about child's progress after medication. We were so happy that we found a doctor who is not keen about injections/admissions. We are thankful always to her. ,2023-12-16 06:13:02,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
