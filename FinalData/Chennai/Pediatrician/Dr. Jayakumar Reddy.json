I was clueless n worried ..\nOne of my friends suggested me Dr. J K Reddy... n forwarded his contact.\nI messaged the Dr. About the situation n to my surprise he messaged back after 30 min with medication. I worked on that n updated him the next day. He keep suggested me few more medicine n helped a lot with the situation. Today is day 5 n my child is much better.  Thanks to the Dr.\nEvery Dr. Start thinking like Dr. J K Reddy ...kids world will rock. Kids need immediate attention..can keep dragging n wait for one day or two n then action ...things can get worsen if not acted on that.  This i have experience with motherhood hospital....",

I find no difference in the treatment / vaccination chart what we had been given in the past in USA.\nBeing a first time mommy, I always have too many questions(most of them are usually silly), but this doctor never gets annoyed & ensures that he gives me a detailed picture of what it is in layman terms, which is always a big relief to me.\nIrrespective of time he supports. Online or offline his treatment is genuine. He keeps things simple rather exaggerating but at the same time he also ensure he doesn't miss any tests.\nAnother speciality is he is master in poking, kids give no reaction when he pokes, I wish I had one such doc when I was kid.\nHe is fluent in many languages & that is again one more advantage for kids to mingle much better. As I have seen him for last few years, he treats all children as same as his own child.\nHe has designed this clinic in a way that every kid loves to spend time. That also shows how well he has understood kids. Infact my son thinks that this is a fun place and asks me every now & then to take him there.\nAfter all this,  I should also be honest that he charges way too less for the hospitality, treatment, support, care he offers.\nUndoubtedly, Dr.Reddy is a godsend.",

I was clueless n worried ..\nOne of my friends suggested me Dr. J K Reddy... n forwarded his contact.\nI messaged the Dr. About the situation n to my surprise he messaged back after 30 min with medication. I worked on that n updated him the next day. He keep suggested me few more medicine n helped a lot with the situation. Today is day 5 n my child is much better.  Thanks to the Dr.\nEvery Dr. Start thinking like Dr. J K Reddy ...kids world will rock. Kids need immediate attention..can keep dragging n wait for one day or two n then action ...things can get worsen if not acted on that.  This i have experience with motherhood hospital....",

I find no difference in the treatment / vaccination chart what we had been given in the past in USA.\nBeing a first time mommy, I always have too many questions(most of them are usually silly), but this doctor never gets annoyed & ensures that he gives me a detailed picture of what it is in layman terms, which is always a big relief to me.\nIrrespective of time he supports. Online or offline his treatment is genuine. He keeps things simple rather exaggerating but at the same time he also ensure he doesn't miss any tests.\nAnother speciality is he is master in poking, kids give no reaction when he pokes, I wish I had one such doc when I was kid.\nHe is fluent in many languages & that is again one more advantage for kids to mingle much better. As I have seen him for last few years, he treats all children as same as his own child.\nHe has designed this clinic in a way that every kid loves to spend time. That also shows how well he has understood kids. Infact my son thinks that this is a fun place and asks me every now & then to take him there.\nAfter all this,  I should also be honest that he charges way too less for the hospitality, treatment, support, care he offers.\nUndoubtedly, Dr.Reddy is a godsend.",
