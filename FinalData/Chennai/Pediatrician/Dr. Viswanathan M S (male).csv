None,None,0,0,NO,"I have visited Chennai Apollo hospital for treatment of my daughter on August 2023. She has abdominal pain. Doctor has done all the tests including endoscopy. Findings was mild antral gastritis. As per his prescription all the medicine taken at right time. Still now no improvement. I have booked for digital consultation of doctor Viswanathan on 06/10/2023  around 5.30 to 5.45pm but before the day of scheduled appointment, appointment rescheduled on 10/10/2023 around 5.0 to 5.15pm. Today I am waiting since 4.45 pm to 8.05pm but no video/audio call received from doctor. Even no rescheduled date. Such kind of behavior from such a reputed hospital is Unexpected. Now I have cancelled the appointment. Don't visit him. ** ** *** * ********** ",2023-10-10 14:47:30,False,False,Pranjit Shil,,,
