"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,Felt really satisfied after meeting Dr. Karthik for getting my son's cough issue ********* ***** *** **** I was at the hospital yesterday 22/01/2020 night at 1am for an emergency as my son was not doing well as he had chronic cough and running nose. The doctor was a night duty doctor and she was not available when I entered the causality though the ward boys took immediate care on my child. The emergency doctor came after 15 mins and started asking questions rudely on what was the reason to rush to the hospital at late night hours. I don't know her name ** *** **** *** ******** **** *** *** ******* *** frankly I never felt like asking her name because of her behavior and the way she treated my son that gave us a very bad experience and impression on her  that she should not be a doctor. She was more focused on why we brought the child at late night and kept suggesting us to admit my son before she could even check the vitals. I never expected a doctor to be this rude and so unprofessional. She being a doctor should give the parents some hope instead of making negative comments. I wasn't satisfied with her prescription so I decided to step in the next day to meet Dr. Karthik and he said nebulization is not at all required as he saw there is no veasing for my son whereas the emergency doctor kept suggesting nebulization. I'm sending this the same evening seeing immediate changes in my son's health. ,2020-01-22 20:15:34,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Paediatric Critical Care,",0,0,YES,"We have visited Dr. Karthik Narayanan for my 2 kids who got sick on same day and it needed PICU care. 
Dr. Karthik was very much approachable, explains issues clearly. 
He is very polite. He talks with positive note and he actually understands a mom's pain when both kids are admitted in hospital. 
I have been visiting to many pediatricians for my kids, have never seen such a high professional, experienced yet so polite doctor. We need this kind of doctor.
