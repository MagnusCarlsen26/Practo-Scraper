"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"Dr Smitha is well learned, very patient and clarifies all the doubts. I was also satisfied about how she suggested some home remedies instead of medicines and also helped with feeding positions as a lactation consultant would do. However introduction of naan and solid foods advice could be better. By 2 months I was told to introduce naan as top up bcoz feeding time was very long - 20 to 40 mins. By 4 months I was told that ideal breastfeeding time is only 5 mins else it means that the baby is not getting sufficient milk. Baby's weight gain n pee counts were very good n indicated sufficient mother's milk. I was adviced to start solids by 4.5 months n I was given sachets of ragi porridge and rice porridge sold by a vendor. I feel a doctor should not advice packed foods n should be strict about only giving moms milk and home made porridge. All other doctors I saw later said it's very common for babies to feed for 40 to 50 mins and I can wait to complete 6 months for starting solid food. 
When we start naan as top up (extra after feeding mom's milk) automatically mother's milk supply will reduce. I had a tough time to stop naan and bring back my baby to mom's milk. ",2018-11-26 05:01:34,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
