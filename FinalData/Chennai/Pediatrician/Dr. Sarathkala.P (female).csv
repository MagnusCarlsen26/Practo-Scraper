"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,"My name is Dhivya Sriram, my daughter was born in Jan 2019. She has neonatal jaundice and had loose stools for about 10-12 times per day for more than 20 days. Her Then Peadtrician Dr. X suggested that it’s a transitional phase, but my girl didn’t have the stamina to suck milk n drink. 

That’s when my cousin referred to Dr Sarathkala, a very child friendly Dr. she analysed the issue on all aspects and suggested bifilac sachet to be given, which drastically arrested her loose stools, that’s when my lo started drinking milk. 
A very encouraging Dr that supports Breastfeeding.
