The doctor was a night duty doctor and she was not available when I entered the causality though the ward boys took immediate care on my child. The emergency doctor came after 15 mins and started asking questions rudely on what was the reason to rush to the hospital at late night hours. I don't know her name ** *** **** *** ******** **** *** *** ******* *** frankly I never felt like asking her name because of her behavior and the way she treated my son that gave us a very bad experience and impression on her  that she should not be a doctor. She was more focused on why we brought the child at late night and kept suggesting us to admit my son before she could even check the vitals. I never expected a doctor to be this rude and so unprofessional. She being a doctor should give the parents some hope instead of making negative comments. I wasn't satisfied with her prescription so I decided to step in the next day to meet Dr. Karthik and he said nebulization is not at all required as he saw there is no veasing for my son whereas the emergency doctor kept suggesting nebulization. I'm sending this the same evening seeing immediate changes in my son's health. ",

The doctor was a night duty doctor and she was not available when I entered the causality though the ward boys took immediate care on my child. The emergency doctor came after 15 mins and started asking questions rudely on what was the reason to rush to the hospital at late night hours. I don't know her name ** *** **** *** ******** **** *** *** ******* *** frankly I never felt like asking her name because of her behavior and the way she treated my son that gave us a very bad experience and impression on her  that she should not be a doctor. She was more focused on why we brought the child at late night and kept suggesting us to admit my son before she could even check the vitals. I never expected a doctor to be this rude and so unprofessional. She being a doctor should give the parents some hope instead of making negative comments. I wasn't satisfied with her prescription so I decided to step in the next day to meet Dr. Karthik and he said nebulization is not at all required as he saw there is no veasing for my son whereas the emergency doctor kept suggesting nebulization. I'm sending this the same evening seeing immediate changes in my son's health. ",
