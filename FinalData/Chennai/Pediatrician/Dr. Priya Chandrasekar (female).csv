"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"If a baby needs a vaccine ,it should be done patiently not in a hurry...since my niece came from Australia the vaccine BCG was not available at time of birth in australia,so came here to do it..this dr was in great hurry ,just took one minute,pricked the baby and said after that only left arm can be given and there will be puss and swelling after two months and then a scar
Now there is blood also coming from that area and when asked another dr they said there are different options to put the vaccine without scar...

None,"Children's Health,",0,0,NO,We visited this Dr last month for my 2mo baby. She was very impatient and never listened to anything we said. She was very fast in jumping to conclusions even before enquiring us properly. I don't know if she is generally a rude person or she was in a hurry to end the consultation. However experienced a Dr could be having respect towards patients is what i would look in.  Won't recommend it for parents who want a Dr who pays attention and has patience to answer queries. ,2017-03-28 18:58:31,False,False,Amirdha,,,
