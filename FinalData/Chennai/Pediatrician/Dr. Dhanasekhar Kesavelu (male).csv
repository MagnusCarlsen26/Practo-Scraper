We visited local doctors they given some mdicines but the problem was same, I took my daughter nearest city to my town There Doctros done scanning, x-ray and they suggested some medicines and told if it is not clear may be need to go for surgery and they suspected  “Hirschsprung's disease”.
I was utter shockedgot about my daughter and sesrched in web for good and experienced doctors I found Dr.Dhanasekhar Sir. I took my daughter to Dhanasekahr Sir, in the first visit it self by seeing my baby he told baby suffering from functional constipation, nothng to worry, My mind relaxed once after hering doctor words, No need surgery.

Very much satisfied with the doctor’s approach. Clarifies every single doubt in detail and offers valuable suggestions. Most important, he listens to patients. Usually, most of the experienced/popuar doctors spend hardly 5 minutes with the patient and don’t spend quality time. But Mr. Dhanasekhar Kesavelu is an exception in this.

Im unable to break the above rules and hence the reason for the change in turns and delay in seeing you i.e walk ins taking priority over online appointments and emergencies taking time over routine visits.
I will ensure that next time around I will make my best effort to see you as soon as possible and i'm sure you will appreciate my problems too!
