"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"We were visiting from the US last summer and my son started vomitting and had stomach pain just a day before your return. Looked up a pediatrician on Practo and went to Dr. Prashanth.

The doctors that I've seen before act like the patients are ignorant and expect them to follow their orders blindly. So it was a pleasant surprise when Dr. Prashant was very friendly and listened to us. He clearly explained that the stomach discomfort was due to the change in the environment from the US to here and all the junk food that were consumed made it worse. He took the time to answer our questions patiently (my wife asks a lot of questions to any doctor that even I get annoyed) and convinced us to not worry about anything. He just gave him probiotics and electrolytes. We were very satisfied and were confident to fly him back the next day,
