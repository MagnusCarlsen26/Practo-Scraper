He then proceeded to examine me for 30 seconds and then just sat back down on his chair and went back to whatever he was doing. I just sat there confused waiting for him to say something. He then just turns to me in a -oh why are you still here?- kind of manner and tells me to go wait outside and his assistent will come to bill me. I was so confused and ask what his diagnosis was and what's wrong with me and he looked almost annoyed that I was asking  questions. He said I just have some infection so please go wait outside and they'll bring me my prescription.\n\nWhen I got the prescription, under the part where it addresses what patient's concerns were, it mentions that I had stuffy nose for 1 week... which further confirms he wasn't paying attention to me because I CLEARLY told him I'd been suffering from congestion for over 2 weeks and have lost my sense of smell.\n\nI'm sure whatever medicines he has prescribed me will work but that's more than what a doctor should be. He was so impatient and quick to dismiss me without even telling me what was wrong. **** **** ** * ****** ** ***** Act respectfully and educate your patients accordingly. Just because you are a senior doctor doesn't give you the right to treat people this way. Patients are entitled to know and be educated on their condition. That's the whole point of coming to the doctor. ** ********** *** *** * ******* *** *********, *** ** **** ** ****** **** ******** ** ******* ******* *** ** ** ******* ** *** *** ********\nWill never go back to this doctor again.
