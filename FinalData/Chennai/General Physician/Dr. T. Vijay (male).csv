"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"I had visited the doctor by looking at the practo feedback for the problem of feeling very mild numbness in right side palm(part of) and below the right side feet. He checked me in first visit and suggested for a nerve test. I have done the test (outside of the hospital) and went to the doctor for showing the reports and reviewing it. He asked me few questions and answered to him, and i clearly explained about my neck problem and about vertigo during my first as well as the second (recent) visit. I know what i had gone through for the neck problem for nearly 5 years, and i knew too that what pain i had gone through to come out of it. Coming to the recent second visit, doctor was doing some test on my neck, bending the neck left and right (using good amount of force) and asking me that any pain, i said no pain but getting mild giddiness, doctor replied that ""no pain even after doing this much"" and he did it one more time. Finally, he prescribed few tablets and i came out of the hospital after paying 400 as consultation charges (though practo says 300). After i came out, was feeling giddy and definitely felt that my neck got disturbed. I was really worried for this, and as i mentioned in earlier that i had visited several doctors including the physiotherapists, none of the doctor had done this kind of testing (bending the neck with tight force) to me even after i mentioned that i have a neck problem and giddiness. After going home also it was troubling me, and i am feeling really sorry of myself why i went there for consultation? Once again i know what i had gone through to get rid of problems because of neck, now i dont know how many days i have to go through this.
