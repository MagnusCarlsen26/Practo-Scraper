None,None,0,0,No,"My wife had been to hospital and consulted the doctor for a general check-up as she had thyroid problem. We are not happy with consultation. Doctor spoke very limited and was not showing any interest to listen to patient. Treatment wise too not happy. He also made sarcastic comments thrice and we are very much disappointed with it. He asked what's purpose of visit and we told him we came for routine check-up and he was like you are coming after 3 years. He told to continue same medicines. Multivitamin tablets were prescribed but he didn't suggest or write when to use and how many to be taken. We purchased and later we checked with nurse about tablets. There was some waiting time in the hospital, it was for 30 minutes.",2021-03-30 03:44:43,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,Consulted the doctor at global hospital Perumbakkam. His team doctors had changed my previously high dose tablet saying my blood sugar was too low and prescribed a low dose for couple of weeks. Now that my blood sugar has shot up due to this new medication he's prescribing insulin. Also he was very inconsiderate and discouraging. I am now a bit apprehensive after consulting him.,2021-08-07 07:00:12,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
