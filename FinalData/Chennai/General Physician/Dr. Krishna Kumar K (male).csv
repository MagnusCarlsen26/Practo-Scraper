,"Outpatient treatment,",0,0,YES,Consulted regarding ear pain. Without wasting much  time he started the treatment & cleaned both the ears. Even microscopic examination was done & medicine applied. Prescribed minimum medicines. He is a very senior ENT Surgeon of more than 40 years experience & he is a no nonseman & no loose talk. All your ENT problems will be dealt with in his safe hands. The clinic in the Apollo speciality Hospital at OMR is fully equipped & hygienic & follows all norms in this epidemic systematically. I strongly recommend this knowledgeable doctor & you won't regret.,2020-09-15 11:38:39,False,True,Mohammed Khaleelullah ,,,
,,0,0,NO,"I do not doubt his experience and expertise BUT *** ********* ******* ******** ** ********** ***************** he barely acknowledged me when I walked in, after I sat in the examination chair he asked me what was wrong and I don't think he really payed much attention to anything I said. He then proceeded to examine me for 30 seconds and then just sat back down on his chair and went back to whatever he was doing. I just sat there confused waiting for him to say something. He then just turns to me in a -oh why are you still here?- kind of manner and tells me to go wait outside and his assistent will come to bill me. I was so confused and ask what his diagnosis was and what's wrong with me and he looked almost annoyed that I was asking  questions. He said I just have some infection so please go wait outside and they'll bring me my prescription.

When I got the prescription, under the part where it addresses what patient's concerns were, it mentions that I had stuffy nose for 1 week... which further confirms he wasn't paying attention to me because I CLEARLY told him I'd been suffering from congestion for over 2 weeks and have lost my sense of smell.

I'm sure whatever medicines he has prescribed me will work but that's more than what a doctor should be. He was so impatient and quick to dismiss me without even telling me what was wrong. **** **** ** * ****** ** ***** Act respectfully and educate your patients accordingly. Just because you are a senior doctor doesn't give you the right to treat people this way. Patients are entitled to know and be educated on their condition. That's the whole point of coming to the doctor. ** ********** *** *** * ******* *** *********, *** ** **** ** ****** **** ******** ** ******* ******* *** ** ** ******* ** *** *** ********
Will never go back to this doctor again. I suggest you find a better ENT. **** **** ******** ********* *** *** **** ***** *******",2024-04-23 09:14:33,False,False,Chriscilla,,,
