Dr Rau is an exception. He was very attentive and listened to me and also he ensured that I give him all the background details of the various issues that I have. Then he started his diagnosis.

When I was young, we used to have family physicians and gone are those days. After a very long time, I felt that Dr Rau should be our family physician. We are encouraged to go to Specialists.
