I consulted Dr Sivaraj since a few months. His methodical treatment and highly positive approach gave great strength and high hopes of quick recovery.Due to his correct and high clinical knowledge I gained and recovered dramatically within the shortest time. I would like to remain under his care and treatment even in future. He is a great asset to not only to the hospital but to the whole array of patients. I wish him great success in his career.
