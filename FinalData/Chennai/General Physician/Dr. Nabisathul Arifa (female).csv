"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,I have consulted Dr.Nasbisathul Aarifa for the first time to get treatment for fever and body pain. I am very much satisfied about her way of approach and kindness towards me.. She really cared about my health because I didn't take food and went simply and she ignored to give injection and she was waiting for us to take food and then she started do inject.. I was happy to this kind of treatment..

,,0,0,YES,"Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit Adam's Clinic run by Dr Nabisathul Arifa when my daughter injured her head when a window grill hit her head.she developed swelling &severe pain . When we reached the clinic, around 9:00 p.m,the doctor had already left ,but the receptionist called her and she rushed to the Clinic within 10 mts,had a thorough examination ,comforted her and prescribed the essential medication.
It is indeed a blessing to have such a Dedicated & Caring Physician at the proximity of our house.. we are so grateful to her on attending on my daughter especially during this pandemic times and too at night leaving her children behind at home. And also avoiding an immediate CT scan, thereby saving us from shelling out too.
