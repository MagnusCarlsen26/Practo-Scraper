None,None,0,0,YES,I would definitely recommend Dr. Balamurugan K. My mother had very high diabetes. He provided my mother with the right treatment to lower her diabetes level. He listens to the patient's concerns and administers the correct medicines. Thank you so much Doctor!,2022-12-31 02:58:17,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
