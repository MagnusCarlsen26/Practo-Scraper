"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Autism Spectrum disorders Treatment,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We know Dr Sai Sucheetra for the past 15+ years. We have never seen such a dedicated person to her job. Actually, she is the one who discovered my son has ADHD/ASD at the age of 2 during a casual visit. It was a complete shock to us. But she stayed a strong support and immediately suggested few home programs to start with and we did so. I believe she is the only person in Southern India (not sure about the rest of India) to come up with this integrated therapy classes (Occupational therapy + Sensory therapy + Speech therapy + Special Education). Because we are basically from Bangalore and we heard therapist there appreciating this kind of integrated classes, which is not there anywhere. The benefit of the integrated therapy classes is that each therapist can know how the kid is improving collectively across all areas. This helps them to set clear goals and work towards it. We took this integrated therapy classes for my son during the summer holidays for a month and we could see a drastic improvement in him. Since then based on her advice we are continuing with different therapist in Bangalore, but still we come to Chennai to check the progress of my son and guidance from her. Now my son is about 4 yrs old and he has shown tremendous improvement in terms of speech, behaviour, and studies. We can completely vouch for Dr Sai Sucheetra and for her treatment. Because we know how sincere she is to this job and her love/care for kids. ",2019-09-30 02:41:59,False,True,Karthikeswaran V,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,Extremely professional and down to earth doctor. She is very well read and patiently answered all my questions. I approached Dr. Sai for my 2 years old girl baby. She heard all my concerns with attention and gave an assessment plan. The assessments were done by her team of therapists who showed commendable diction and precision in their approach. A clear plan was provided and doctor counselled us about the strengths and difficulty faced by my child very well* **** ****** *** *********** ***** **** ***** ** ** *** ************* ***** ** ******,2021-06-05 19:07:37,False,True,Vasavi,,,

None,None,0,0,YES,My experience was amazing with Dr. Sai Sucheetra. I felt that Dr. Sucheetra is very much interested in my 4 years sonâ€™s physical and mental health and his comfort. Everything is well explained about his shortcomings. I never made to feel that caring for us is a burden for doctor. I am no reluctance to ask for what I need . On top of that the medical outcome is great in last 8 month since we start to work and taking care of our child with her guidance. I would recommend Dr. Sucheetra to anyone home and abroad who needs this procedure.,2020-07-29 08:52:29,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
