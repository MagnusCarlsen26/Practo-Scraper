Thanks for all your support  (Medical and Emotional). Your contribution in my life is nothing short of magical.

Until now I associated the word Surgery with Misery. After being under the careful watch of a doctor like you, I associate Surgery with Recovery. Thanks.

If every doctor strives to be as caring and generous as you, the world would be filled with smiles and laughter instead of pain and sorrow. Thanks for everything Sir!!",2017-02-28 13:14:39,False,True,Divya U,,,
