He's a brilliant diagnostician and connects multiple dots in split seconds. He's also upto date with the latest and evolving research in medicine and provides us with the approach that works. Highly, highly recommend Dr Subhash!",

He was very attentive and listened to me and also he ensured that I give him all the background details of the various issues that I have. Then he started his diagnosis. Paying attention is very important for the patient to get confidence. I experienced this most with him. As a General Physician his approach is total and he also made sure he explained the medications to be taken. He was never in a hurry. I am 59 years old. When I was young, we used to have family physicians and gone are those days. After a very long time, I felt that Dr Rau should be our family physician. We are encouraged to go to Specialists. But, General Physicians should be the first step and there should be continuity in treat. GP can always refer to specialists. Thank you Doctor for your service. I appreciate it. I also thank my friend who referred me to him. I am doing better now. Hope to continue with him. ",

He was very attentive and listened to me and also he ensured that I give him all the background details of the various issues that I have. Then he started his diagnosis. Paying attention is very important for the patient to get confidence. I experienced this most with him. As a General Physician his approach is total and he also made sure he explained the medications to be taken. He was never in a hurry. I am 59 years old. When I was young, we used to have family physicians and gone are those days. After a very long time, I felt that Dr Rau should be our family physician. We are encouraged to go to Specialists. But, General Physicians should be the first step and there should be continuity in treat. GP can always refer to specialists. Thank you Doctor for your service. I appreciate it. I also thank my friend who referred me to him. I am doing better now. Hope to continue with him. ",

He has diagnosed and treated my friends, family and me over the years and we are very grateful to him. \nAfter weeks of excruciating pain and fever and several meetings with other doctors and tests, I went to see Dr. Subash for a bladder infection. He was the only doctor I met at the time that instructed me to do the correct tests. The results showed that I had an acute kidney infection that was unresponsive to oral antibiotics.  I was admitted immediately and treated under his supervision at Venkateswara Hospitals and made a full recovery within weeks. \nDr Subash is kind, courteous and an excellent diagnostician! ",
