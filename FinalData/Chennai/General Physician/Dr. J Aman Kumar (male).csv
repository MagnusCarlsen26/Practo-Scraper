None,"Wellness checkup,",0,0,YES,"Is it really possible to see a cool doctor in city like chennai ? Such a friendly doctor with lots of positive vibes around him. My consultation with Dr.aman is for general check up and mainly for excessive sweating on head. After all prescribed laboratory test , He suggested me to do some stress relief exercises.  Now after a month , I feel better. Sweating is now on control. Thanks Doctor for your advice and support.
