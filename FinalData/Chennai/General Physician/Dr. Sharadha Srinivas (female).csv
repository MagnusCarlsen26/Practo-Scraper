None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Sharadha was my husband's paediatrician and now our first born's paediatrician. That in itself speaks volumes of both her experience and the trust we have on her. She has a very warm and positive personality and answers our numerous questions with patience. Her approach to treating ailments seem very practical - using the efficiency of modern medicine and at the same time not forcing us to deviate from cultural practices (unless they are harmful for the baby). Despite being a visiting doctor in numerous hospitals hinting a very busy schedule she responds to us on a timely manner.

None,None,0,0,NO,"Have visited thee doctor twice for my infant's vaccination. 

My baby's first vaccination - 
The appointment was delayed by more than an hour as the doctor arrived late. When it was our turn, she had hushed up to close the appointment in less than a minute before I could clarify my doubts. 

Second vaccination -
The second appointment was as well delayed by more than half hour. This time I had my list of questions ready to shoot before she sends us out. 
This time around, she forgot to tell us that the baby could fall sick post vaccination and suggest the appropriate medicine. When asked as well, this did not strike her. Well, she was too busy with her smartphone to have heard it. The baby did fall sick and cried all night. We rushed to the hospital at 3am (READ 3 IN THE MORNING) where he was delivered and the duty nurse suggested we give Paracetamol for the time-being and admit the baby so the doctor could visit the following day! The Paracetamol worked well. We decided not to admit and see her ever again!",2015-12-21 10:10:45,False,False,Charan,,,
