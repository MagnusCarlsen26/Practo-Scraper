"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Acupuncture,",0,0,YES,"I am married for 7 years and we planned to have a child after 3 years of our married life. While we were very eager to start a family, I could not get pregnant as easily as I thought. Myself and my husband were living abroad and were quite hesitant to start with any fertility treatment hastily without any proper guidance. 
Hence, I came down to India in 2018 for a health checkup at a renowned hospital in Chetpet, Chennai. After a master checkup, the chief doctor there performed Hysterolaproscopy for a left  tubal disconnection. Also, later I was told that I could get pregnant only through IVF. With no other option left and without asking any 2nd opinion, I underwent all the procedures for IVF. Finally at the end of the IVF procedure, after embryo transplant , it was sad to know that I did not conceive. It was so harrowing to experience that feel, because emotionally and financially it was quite a loss for us. Though the IVF doctor asked me to go for a second attempt immediately even after the failed attempt, I was not physically and mentally prepared for it again.

Thats when I met Dr.Rajesh Verma at Bliss Acupuncture, Vadapalani in November 2019. After talking in detail about my experience and going through my health reports, Dr. Rajesh Verma guided to me undergo an Acupuncture session for a period of 6 months and assured me that I will definitely get pregnant before the completion of this 6 months. It was a 15 day session every month and I also took combination medicines that he suggested along with Acupuncture to improve my overall immunity and better health and fertility. Doctor assured me that I could naturally conceive and if by chance needed also I could try for IUI option and definitely not in need for IVF as I had age and my fertility level was satisfactory. 

With all the confidence that Dr. Rajesh gave me and the best Acupuncture treatment that I got from him and the blessings of the almighty I got pregnant in March 2020. Owing to my time constraint I opted for IUI for my pregnancy. I got pregnant in IUI in my first attempt. 

I am now a happy mom to a BABY BOY. I cannot thank Dr. Rajesh Verma enough for the happiness that I am enjoying today being a mother. I should say, he diagnosed where my problem was and treated me exactly. His accuracy in the treatment is excellent. I highly recommend other people who are trying for pregnancy or not able to get pregnant to have an opinion with Dr.Rajesh Verma before choosing any hasty options as he genuinely guides you in the right path.

It was nice to meet you & your brother for the first time. I was hoping to have a long term Doctor/Patient relationship. 
As you know you were suffering for the last 14 years from chronic back pain, sciatica and immobility as you discussed on the first day of your visit. You told that you had visited many doctors but their treatment didn’t help you much. So you had come to us after going through our positive comments in practo.

As Explained to you on day one of your treatment

1.	Your condition is very chronic and after the basic sessions you will have to take the maintenance session for 1 yr for which you agreed and the treatment was started with your consent. You completed your basic session and got relieved of pain and inspite of my advice for not riding a two wheeler you injured yourselves  while riding a bike. However your deteriorated condition was taken care of promptly. And you got rid of your pain once again. Thereafter you have not followed our protocol as suggested for maintenance sessions and had stop coming without any information for the last one month. However, you have last visited me on 12 May  and you commented that I discussed now about further  treatment of 1 yr which is not true.  And Again I informed not to travel in two wheeler  you have not followed my suggestion and was travelling as a pillion on your brother’s bike.
 
2.	In your feedback you have written that I have always been late for your treatment but let me remind you have sometimes reached prior to your appointment for your monetary benefits from OLA cab and rescheduling the timing according to your convenience but still I accommodated you even during my lunch hours. However you don’t want to be transparent and wanted to defame me with wrong allegations. For your information I have done a lot of free medical camps for the poor and needy people (who can’t afford). This I didn’t want to mention to you cos you will not understand “what is a feeling of being a Doctor”.


3.	 You have also commented about medicinal marketing done by our centre. Let me tell you consultation fees of Rs 500 is clearly mentioned in practo. Secondly one hour acupuncture session with fresh needles additional cost of needles Rs 100 was informed and as you have agreed also.  If I have all my information of practice in practo ie consultation charges with treatments you call  “Medicinal marketing”  but for many other patients it is a boon that they have come to our clinic with reference, feedbacks and content published from Practo. I take my profession seriously and only if you had been equally serious about your treatment your condition would have been better now. 

No regrets and hoping that you get rid of your pain soon.",2016-06-01T19:48:50+0000,Dr. Rajesh Verma

We also sometimes recommend to consult doctors in case of hypertension or in acute conditions to take modern medicine as we do encourage other system of medicine given by doctors for relieving of symptoms faster. However we cannot compare the system/therapy with cost and duration as benefits depends on many factors like lifestyle,  diet,  season change etc. I am happy that you got well and cure for all the above conditions.

Hi, you have visited twice and taken medication for 2 months. We give prescription thru mail with complete details of the medicines. I had sent the prescription and bill on 2nd September 2017, If you haven't received the mail I will send again and i apologise that you haven't received it.
Asthma is very chronic disease and it is not possible to get relief in 40 days. We have to assess your condition after three months of treatment to know for improvement and the medicines prescribed were taken in time or any other condition to be taken care for better results. Surely we will help you in this regard. In your 2nd visit you have not taken medicines as we have suggested. You have not come on 1st week of this month to collect the remaining medicines and only taken medication partly. However please take the medicines regularly as prescribed. I remember that you said some relief in dry cough in the first course of medicines, when taken properly. But now you comment that there is no relief. I am glad that you are visiting this month for continuing the treatment after the conversation over phone we had today.  I have sent again the prescription. 

Hope you get relief at the earliest

Hi,
You visited our clinic with the problem of loss of appetite on 4th December 2017. As we take complete history of the patient by not only pulse diagnosis but also try to find the sign and symptoms of the disease by questioning and suggesting further test. There are various causes for Loss of appetite including psychological factors like Stress, Anxiety, Depression, loss of taste, bloating, chronic illness, ill effects of medication etc. You, in any case, had not agreed with any of the above reasons for your problem and you insisted that you have already got the endoscopy done few months back which was not reproduced at the time of consultation... That’s the reason why I suggested further investigation before starting any treatment. However, If u have done latest test and there is no issues... It is a good sign.
