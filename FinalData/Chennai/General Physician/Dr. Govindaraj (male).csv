"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Pain Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Met Dr ABG  (as he is addressed by every one there) referred by a Friend who speaks very high of the Doctor. Consulted him for pain in the right knee which also has ligament tears and pain beneath the right shoulder.

He asked appropriate questions to understand the issues and ordered for X-ray. Though he had to leave Office for other commitments, stayed back to see my X-rays to suggest treatment.

Very patient, friendly, humble for his stature and answered all my queries without any irritation as I was eating into his time.

No tests were ordered and he advised me not to go for scans unnecessarily and told me to meet him after 3 months. Only exercises were  advised which he himself taught me and waited patiently till I got them right.

He is so approachable and makes u feel at ease throughout the consultation. 

Was happy I met not only a good Doctor but a very good human being also.",2020-11-14 08:33:32,False,True,Mrs. C. Sindhu,,,
