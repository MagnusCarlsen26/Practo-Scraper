Doctor was very kind. Gives enough time for you to explain your problem. Does a brief diagnosis of your problem. Most important of all, he has the courtesy to listen to you completely. When a doctor listens, you feel half the pain come down.

He asked me to twist my arms in different directions. Then gave me two options to find the exact issue. Whether to take X-ray or to take a Scan directly. He also told that the scan shall straight away reveal your problem but X-ray shall or shall not. This would help me reduce the cost of going again and again. Being this transparent is much appreciated than asking me to take X-ray and then again call me for scan.

He also explained the clear consequences of this pain and what it shall lead to. He suggested me few immediate precautions to be taken that shall reduce the pain.

I started following those precautions and now feeling a lot better. He is the first doctor who has not suggested me any pills till any diagnosis has been done. This shall be well appreciated.
