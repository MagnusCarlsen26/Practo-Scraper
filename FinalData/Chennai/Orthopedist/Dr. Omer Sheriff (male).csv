,,0,0,YES,"This feedback is with regard to Dr. Omer (Orthopaedic),

We can't *thank you* enough for what you've done for us doctor. Our mum Violet came in with Rotator cuff tear and supraspinatus ligaments tear with fluid secretion that needed immediate attention and surgery.
Words won't suffice to say thank you to doctor Omer for guiding us with the end to end procedure with patience and also coordination with the billing team for a smooth transitioning! Doctor went above and beyond in every way doing the best for our mum with the surgery and the care, for assuring and comforting her when she needed it and assuring the finest treatment when she was terrified and for all the valuable advice. Thank you for turning this terrific nightmare to something we could deal with ease knowing that through God you were working on her. We will always be grateful to you. We extend our gratitude to the physiotherapy team, anaesthetia team, the kind nurses and all who helped with the smooth hospital experience. 

God bless you always and the work of ur hands.
