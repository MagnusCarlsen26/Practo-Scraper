When my father met with an accident and broke his legs, he was the one who operated and fixed it.  This time, my spouse fell down and suffered from ligament tear. He operated and fixed it. Both are fine now. Thanks to Dr. Arun.",

It was a very sensitive time and Dr Arun had consoled us, explained in detail of the condition of the fracture and the treatment procedures. He had implanted three screws (ORIF) inside her knees and made her walk without any support (walker etc) in 6 months with continuous follow-ups and physiotherapy. \n\nIn general that the implants supposed to be removed within a stipulated time (i.e within 3 years) from the time of implantation. However, due to my wife\u2019s pregnancy and personal challenges, we had postponed the implants removal as many times. We were very much worried as it had been many years over and thinking of the complexity of the operation / removal of implants. However, Dr Arun had removed those three screws completely at Murugan Hospitals in Kilpauk in Oct 2018 and made my wife walk in few days. \n\nLast but not least that I would thank every staffs at the Murugan hospitals. They were very friendly (be it duty Doctors, Nurses, Helpers & housekeeping staffs) and polite in attending / responding us. \n\nThank you very much Dr Arun Sir! \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr Arun / Murugan hospitals for your needs / medical attentions.",

It was a very sensitive time and Dr Arun had consoled us, explained in detail of the condition of the fracture and the treatment procedures. He had implanted three screws (ORIF) inside her knees and made her walk without any support (walker etc) in 6 months with continuous follow-ups and physiotherapy. \n\nIn general that the implants supposed to be removed within a stipulated time (i.e within 3 years) from the time of implantation. However, due to my wife\u2019s pregnancy and personal challenges, we had postponed the implants removal as many times. We were very much worried as it had been many years over and thinking of the complexity of the operation / removal of implants. However, Dr Arun had removed those three screws completely at Murugan Hospitals in Kilpauk in Oct 2018 and made my wife walk in few days. \n\nLast but not least that I would thank every staffs at the Murugan hospitals. They were very friendly (be it duty Doctors, Nurses, Helpers & housekeeping staffs) and polite in attending / responding us. \n\nThank you very much Dr Arun Sir! \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr Arun / Murugan hospitals for your needs / medical attentions.",
