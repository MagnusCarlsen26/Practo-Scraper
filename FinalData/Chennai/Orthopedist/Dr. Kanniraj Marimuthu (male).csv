Even though my father met with severe fracture on last July 2017, he made him walk very well at an very affordable cost which I never imagined.

When my father admitted into a popular ortho hospital in chennai, They told me that cost of hip replacement would be around 7 lakhs.

By god grace, i got connected to this doctor through our regular doctor.

Cost me a total of 1.4 lakhs ( Inc of Hospital charges for 5 days, Room rent etc & got covered by my brother insurance.)

Now my father started walking very well.

We will get confident about our health when he speaks...

He saved me from making huge debts.

Our family will never forget him.

After an year I went there for severe back pain.

After checking, he prescribed some exercises to learn it from physio therapist.
