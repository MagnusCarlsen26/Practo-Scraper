                "review_text": "Dr. Damodaran P R \u2013 The best of the best Ortho Doctor\n\nFour years back, my mom met with a road accident and fractured her right arm. She was rushed to Apollo Perungudi in an ambulance to the ER. After the first aid, she was diagnosed with humerus bone fracture. That was the first time, we met Dr. Damodaran. He not only assessed my mom\u2019s condition but also our family\u2019s anxiety and fear because of the traumatic road accident. The first thing he did was to calm all of us down by patiently explaining what has happened and what corrective measures he is going to take. He spoke very patiently to my sobbing mom, relaxed her and gave all the assurance she needed. He explained the procedure to me in detail. I still think he absolutely had no need to take the time to talk to the distraught family, but he did that. Just by talking to him, we, including my mom were at peace and gained strength to face the surgery. \n\nThe surgery was successfully completed. Mom went to recovery room, where her vitals were monitored. Doctor reached out to us to explain how the plate was fixed and the process of recovery. I could not imagine how a busy surgeon like him finds time in the world to talk, not only to the patient but also to their family members, just to put their mind to ease. Even before the surgery, I was confident that he is going to cure my mom and I have come to the right place. We had total faith in him.\n\nDr. Damodaran\u2019s loving care did not stop with the surgery. During every OP visit, post-surgery, he attended to my mom with the same care. He reassured her, encouraged her to do physio and motivated her back to normal health with full functioning of her arm.\n\nLast week, while cleaning the house, my mom had a bad fall in the living room. She was in severe pain. After I got the call about the incident, my first thought was, maybe she hit her arm again and the plate she had has moved. Oh boy, was I wrong! She could not move her right arm. I remembered from the last incident that fracture causes swelling. But this time, it did not swell or I misses to see it with the cloths on. We went to a local hospital, they did the Xray and diagnosed it is a fracture again, near the shoulder. It was devastating to see my mom, 61 years now, suffering from unbearable pain. I panicked. I called Dr.Damodaran\u2019s number directly. This was on a Saturday, around 8 PM. Doctor immediately picked up. I tried to remind him that he treated my mom with a surgery 4 years back and she has another fracture now.  Doctor asked me to bring her to the hospital immediately and share the Xray over phone. \n\nWhen there were some complexities in getting the ambulance, I called the Doctor again. He immediately spoke to the ER and we got the ambulance in 15 minutes. After we reached the ER, my mom was examined fully to ensure that she is all good from the fall except for the fractured arm. Doctor called me again, explained what has happened this time. My mom also complained of chest pain, which she started realizing only after the settling down of arm pain with the painkillers. We guessed, with the terrible pain of the fracture, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to the chest. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t turn out to be anything serious. \n\nAfter consulting with cardiologist and his clearance, Dr. Damodaran performed the surgery. This time, I absolutely had no questions on the surgery or no doubts. I had nothing to worry. I knew that he is the best of the best and he is going to make my mom alright again.\n\nOn the day of the surgery, Doctor had a pretty busy day. He had back-to-back procedures with different patients. My mom\u2019s surgery went for a long time, or I felt like that. I figured it was a complex operation as Doctor decided to not remove the old plate and add the new one without causing a friction.\n\nJust like last time, Doctor met us after the surgery. He showed us pictures of the new plating, and explained the deformity correction and rotator cuff repair. We will be meeting him in the coming weeks for regular check-ups.\nI really feel fortunate that I was able to reach Dr. Damodaran that night and he was available to perform the surgery. He is an angel in disguise. I wish from the bottom of my heart that he lives a very long life, to help people recover from pain. ** ** *** **** ** *** ***** Thank you, Doctor!",

But following fall, she developed severe burning sensation and weakness in the left hand. My wife was struggling to do any work and even struggling to look after her self. She has been taking various medications for that but did not improve. Then we met Dr Damodaran through practo in his clinic. we didn't need to wait long as it was by appointment and the staffs were pleasant. Dr Damodaran examined my wife thoroughly and diagnosed that she had  isolated nerve injury and called it ulnar nerve neuropraxia due to dislocation. Apparently this is unusual occurrence. He suggested physiotherapy to start with. I must say within few days my wife experienced improvement and the burning sensation reduced. and her tablets intake came down drastically. The physiotherapist in his clinic was experienced and she could teach simple things. Dr Damodaran's correct diagnosis and timely treatment helped my wife gain her strength. She has improved a lot.\nI recommend Dr Damodaran not only for his ability but also for his pleasant demeanor and the patience he has to explain things in detail.",

Based on the initial x-rays, we were told by the emergency treatment doctor that she had dislocated her ankle and met with multiple fracture and might have to undergo an immediate surgery and that Dr.Damodaran will advise us further. This had put the entire family into a state of anxiety and concern.  \n\nDr.Damodaran came over to meet us and explained the situation very clearly with the x-ray reports and rationale for the immediate surgery required.  He also explained the situation to my sister who was anxiously waiting over the phone call from the US.  The doctor was extremely patient with us and answered all our questions, which helped us decide to go ahead with the next course of treatment.   \n\nMy mom felt a great sense of relief and comfort with the assurance provided by the doctor before the surgery that she will do well.  \nBy God's grace, the surgery went well.  Immediately after the surgery, the doctor came out of the theatre and showed us the pictures of the implant done to the ankle fracture.  Post 6 weeks of complete bed rest, the doctor suggested a good physiotherapist and gave complete oversight and supervision throughout the sessions.  \n\nToday, we are all so happy to see our mom walk on her own without support.   We owe this credit to Dr.Damodaran who has been with us throughout  during this phase by providing utmost care and attention and offering medical guidance as and when needed.   Thank you very much Doctor and truly appreciate your service.   \n\nA treatment can provide physical cure to a patient but mental strength can be gained only through the doctor's friendly, patient, re-assuring positive attitude.  My mom gained immense mental strength through your amazing attitude.  Thank you once again and our humble regards. Rama & Chitra\n ",

Even if he was new to us, we felt that he was old time friend and we can ask him any questions and share any kind of treatment issues or problems and he attends to it immediately. He also keeps track that his supporting team is also doing their best for the patient and the patient is fully satisfied and taken best care of. He is updated in his work and very competent and I feel safe to take my old parents to him for treatment as he would do only what is necessary and he would treat my parents so well throughout the treatment. Thank you Doctor ",

My uncle enjoys the care, respect and attention \ngiven by Dr Damodaran which probably helped him to get over this ordeal with minimal discomfort.\nThank you very much Dr Damodaran for everything. \n",

                "review_text": "Dr. Damodaran P R \u2013 The best of the best Ortho Doctor\n\nFour years back, my mom met with a road accident and fractured her right arm. She was rushed to Apollo Perungudi in an ambulance to the ER. After the first aid, she was diagnosed with humerus bone fracture. That was the first time, we met Dr. Damodaran. He not only assessed my mom\u2019s condition but also our family\u2019s anxiety and fear because of the traumatic road accident. The first thing he did was to calm all of us down by patiently explaining what has happened and what corrective measures he is going to take. He spoke very patiently to my sobbing mom, relaxed her and gave all the assurance she needed. He explained the procedure to me in detail. I still think he absolutely had no need to take the time to talk to the distraught family, but he did that. Just by talking to him, we, including my mom were at peace and gained strength to face the surgery. \n\nThe surgery was successfully completed. Mom went to recovery room, where her vitals were monitored. Doctor reached out to us to explain how the plate was fixed and the process of recovery. I could not imagine how a busy surgeon like him finds time in the world to talk, not only to the patient but also to their family members, just to put their mind to ease. Even before the surgery, I was confident that he is going to cure my mom and I have come to the right place. We had total faith in him.\n\nDr. Damodaran\u2019s loving care did not stop with the surgery. During every OP visit, post-surgery, he attended to my mom with the same care. He reassured her, encouraged her to do physio and motivated her back to normal health with full functioning of her arm.\n\nLast week, while cleaning the house, my mom had a bad fall in the living room. She was in severe pain. After I got the call about the incident, my first thought was, maybe she hit her arm again and the plate she had has moved. Oh boy, was I wrong! She could not move her right arm. I remembered from the last incident that fracture causes swelling. But this time, it did not swell or I misses to see it with the cloths on. We went to a local hospital, they did the Xray and diagnosed it is a fracture again, near the shoulder. It was devastating to see my mom, 61 years now, suffering from unbearable pain. I panicked. I called Dr.Damodaran\u2019s number directly. This was on a Saturday, around 8 PM. Doctor immediately picked up. I tried to remind him that he treated my mom with a surgery 4 years back and she has another fracture now.  Doctor asked me to bring her to the hospital immediately and share the Xray over phone. \n\nWhen there were some complexities in getting the ambulance, I called the Doctor again. He immediately spoke to the ER and we got the ambulance in 15 minutes. After we reached the ER, my mom was examined fully to ensure that she is all good from the fall except for the fractured arm. Doctor called me again, explained what has happened this time. My mom also complained of chest pain, which she started realizing only after the settling down of arm pain with the painkillers. We guessed, with the terrible pain of the fracture, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to the chest. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t turn out to be anything serious. \n\nAfter consulting with cardiologist and his clearance, Dr. Damodaran performed the surgery. This time, I absolutely had no questions on the surgery or no doubts. I had nothing to worry. I knew that he is the best of the best and he is going to make my mom alright again.\n\nOn the day of the surgery, Doctor had a pretty busy day. He had back-to-back procedures with different patients. My mom\u2019s surgery went for a long time, or I felt like that. I figured it was a complex operation as Doctor decided to not remove the old plate and add the new one without causing a friction.\n\nJust like last time, Doctor met us after the surgery. He showed us pictures of the new plating, and explained the deformity correction and rotator cuff repair. We will be meeting him in the coming weeks for regular check-ups.\nI really feel fortunate that I was able to reach Dr. Damodaran that night and he was available to perform the surgery. He is an angel in disguise. I wish from the bottom of my heart that he lives a very long life, to help people recover from pain. ** ** *** **** ** *** ***** Thank you, Doctor!",

But following fall, she developed severe burning sensation and weakness in the left hand. My wife was struggling to do any work and even struggling to look after her self. She has been taking various medications for that but did not improve. Then we met Dr Damodaran through practo in his clinic. we didn't need to wait long as it was by appointment and the staffs were pleasant. Dr Damodaran examined my wife thoroughly and diagnosed that she had  isolated nerve injury and called it ulnar nerve neuropraxia due to dislocation. Apparently this is unusual occurrence. He suggested physiotherapy to start with. I must say within few days my wife experienced improvement and the burning sensation reduced. and her tablets intake came down drastically. The physiotherapist in his clinic was experienced and she could teach simple things. Dr Damodaran's correct diagnosis and timely treatment helped my wife gain her strength. She has improved a lot.\nI recommend Dr Damodaran not only for his ability but also for his pleasant demeanor and the patience he has to explain things in detail.",

Based on the initial x-rays, we were told by the emergency treatment doctor that she had dislocated her ankle and met with multiple fracture and might have to undergo an immediate surgery and that Dr.Damodaran will advise us further. This had put the entire family into a state of anxiety and concern.  \n\nDr.Damodaran came over to meet us and explained the situation very clearly with the x-ray reports and rationale for the immediate surgery required.  He also explained the situation to my sister who was anxiously waiting over the phone call from the US.  The doctor was extremely patient with us and answered all our questions, which helped us decide to go ahead with the next course of treatment.   \n\nMy mom felt a great sense of relief and comfort with the assurance provided by the doctor before the surgery that she will do well.  \nBy God's grace, the surgery went well.  Immediately after the surgery, the doctor came out of the theatre and showed us the pictures of the implant done to the ankle fracture.  Post 6 weeks of complete bed rest, the doctor suggested a good physiotherapist and gave complete oversight and supervision throughout the sessions.  \n\nToday, we are all so happy to see our mom walk on her own without support.   We owe this credit to Dr.Damodaran who has been with us throughout  during this phase by providing utmost care and attention and offering medical guidance as and when needed.   Thank you very much Doctor and truly appreciate your service.   \n\nA treatment can provide physical cure to a patient but mental strength can be gained only through the doctor's friendly, patient, re-assuring positive attitude.  My mom gained immense mental strength through your amazing attitude.  Thank you once again and our humble regards. Rama & Chitra\n ",

Even if he was new to us, we felt that he was old time friend and we can ask him any questions and share any kind of treatment issues or problems and he attends to it immediately. He also keeps track that his supporting team is also doing their best for the patient and the patient is fully satisfied and taken best care of. He is updated in his work and very competent and I feel safe to take my old parents to him for treatment as he would do only what is necessary and he would treat my parents so well throughout the treatment. Thank you Doctor ",

My uncle enjoys the care, respect and attention \ngiven by Dr Damodaran which probably helped him to get over this ordeal with minimal discomfort.\nThank you very much Dr Damodaran for everything. \n",

Dr Damodaran was very professional in his approach and having sensed from the test results that patient could have spinal related condition, he drafted in two of his relevant colleagues and they explained to us the condition which determined the future course of action. Despite being a senior/speciality and busy doctor he was kind, considerate and gave us sufficient time, and more importantly provided us sound professional judgement.
