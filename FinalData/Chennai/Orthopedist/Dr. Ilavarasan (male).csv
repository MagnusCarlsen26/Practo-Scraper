,,0,0,YES,"I have consulted Dr. Ilavarasan for my mother spine and leg pain issues. The way he explained her issues and concern over prescribing the medicine and treatment is really heart melting. Really he is taking care of complete health issue before prescribing any tablet or even for ointment. Also he is explaining to patient in a better way they can understand what they can do and protect themselves in future.

After his consultation my mother and my whole family is felt really very happy. ",2020-11-27 16:22:33,False,True,M. JAYASEELAN,,,
