"Explanation of the health issue,","Spinal Disorders,Spinal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My family finally advised that I should go to MIOT hospital after visiting two or three hospitals due to my mother's spinal disorders surgery problem. There, I met Dr. Charanjit Singh Dhillon, and they quickly identified the issues within a few hours. They recommended having spinal surgery and explained the costs along with other procedures; everything is fine aside from the surgery's price tag. As a middle-class family visiting MIOT hospital because of your excellent surgery, I am aware of the tremendous  of work and effort you put in. I kindly ask the doctor and MIOT hospital administration to extend a discount to middle-class families. After Sale our house, we had to pay for the surgery. Every hospital has a department dedicated to raising money for our middle class citizens. a score of 10/10
