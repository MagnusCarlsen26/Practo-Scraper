"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr Madhan sir is an excellent orthopedist by profession and amicable in nature. Due to an accident, I had very complex tibial plateau fracture and Dr Madhan did the surgery.  Though it was a complex fracture, with his expertise Dr Madhan treated it very well. Within 2 months I almost became normal and able to walk without any assistance. 

He has lots of patience and was always available to clarify my doubts (with a smile) in a friendly manner during the course of rehabilitation. Finally I would say that I am fortunate to undergo surgery by Dr Madhan and always grateful to him.",2018-05-13 08:18:39,False,True,Venkataraghava P,,,
