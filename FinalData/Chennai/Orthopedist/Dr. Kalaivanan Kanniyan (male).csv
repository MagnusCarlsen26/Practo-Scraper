None,None,0,0,YES,I had taken my dad with a chronic  back ache. Doctor was extremely kind in understanding his problem and attended to all the aspects of his complaint.

In this busy day and age to find such an empathetic doctor was such a blessing ,2023-06-13 10:49:08,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
