I recently visited Dr. Jeff Walter to seek treatment for my wife's frozen shoulder condition. After a thorough examination, he prescribed minimal medication for seven days followed by a tailored set of exercises. Over the course of six months of dedication to the exercise regimen, my wife experienced a remarkable recovery.

Initially, my wife was unable to move her right hand from the shoulder to the elbow due to the stiffness and pain associated with frozen shoulder. However, thanks to Dr. Jeff Walter's treatment plan and her commitment to the exercises, she has made significant progress. She can now lift both her hands fully, indicating a complete recovery from the condition.
