"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Damodaran P R ‚Äì The best of the best Ortho Doctor

Four years back, my mom met with a road accident and fractured her right arm. She was rushed to Apollo Perungudi in an ambulance to the ER. After the first aid, she was diagnosed with humerus bone fracture. That was the first time, we met Dr. Damodaran. He not only assessed my mom‚Äôs condition but also our family‚Äôs anxiety and fear because of the traumatic road accident. The first thing he did was to calm all of us down by patiently explaining what has happened and what corrective measures he is going to take. He spoke very patiently to my sobbing mom, relaxed her and gave all the assurance she needed. He explained the procedure to me in detail. I still think he absolutely had no need to take the time to talk to the distraught family, but he did that. Just by talking to him, we, including my mom were at peace and gained strength to face the surgery. 

The surgery was successfully completed. Mom went to recovery room, where her vitals were monitored. Doctor reached out to us to explain how the plate was fixed and the process of recovery. I could not imagine how a busy surgeon like him finds time in the world to talk, not only to the patient but also to their family members, just to put their mind to ease. Even before the surgery, I was confident that he is going to cure my mom and I have come to the right place. We had total faith in him.

Dr. Damodaran‚Äôs loving care did not stop with the surgery. During every OP visit, post-surgery, he attended to my mom with the same care. He reassured her, encouraged her to do physio and motivated her back to normal health with full functioning of her arm.

Last week, while cleaning the house, my mom had a bad fall in the living room. She was in severe pain. After I got the call about the incident, my first thought was, maybe she hit her arm again and the plate she had has moved. Oh boy, was I wrong! She could not move her right arm. I remembered from the last incident that fracture causes swelling. But this time, it did not swell or I misses to see it with the cloths on. We went to a local hospital, they did the Xray and diagnosed it is a fracture again, near the shoulder. It was devastating to see my mom, 61 years now, suffering from unbearable pain. I panicked. I called Dr.Damodaran‚Äôs number directly. This was on a Saturday, around 8 PM. Doctor immediately picked up. I tried to remind him that he treated my mom with a surgery 4 years back and she has another fracture now.  Doctor asked me to bring her to the hospital immediately and share the Xray over phone. 

When there were some complexities in getting the ambulance, I called the Doctor again. He immediately spoke to the ER and we got the ambulance in 15 minutes. After we reached the ER, my mom was examined fully to ensure that she is all good from the fall except for the fractured arm. Doctor called me again, explained what has happened this time. My mom also complained of chest pain, which she started realizing only after the settling down of arm pain with the painkillers. We guessed, with the terrible pain of the fracture, she couldn‚Äôt pay attention to the chest. Thankfully, it didn‚Äôt turn out to be anything serious. 

After consulting with cardiologist and his clearance, Dr. Damodaran performed the surgery. This time, I absolutely had no questions on the surgery or no doubts. I had nothing to worry. I knew that he is the best of the best and he is going to make my mom alright again.

On the day of the surgery, Doctor had a pretty busy day. He had back-to-back procedures with different patients. My mom‚Äôs surgery went for a long time, or I felt like that. I figured it was a complex operation as Doctor decided to not remove the old plate and add the new one without causing a friction.

Just like last time, Doctor met us after the surgery. He showed us pictures of the new plating, and explained the deformity correction and rotator cuff repair. We will be meeting him in the coming weeks for regular check-ups.
I really feel fortunate that I was able to reach Dr. Damodaran that night and he was available to perform the surgery. He is an angel in disguise. I wish from the bottom of my heart that he lives a very long life, to help people recover from pain. ** ** *** **** ** *** ***** Thank you, Doctor!",2022-09-27 17:34:08,False,True,Nithya Kannan,,,

This had put the entire family into a state of anxiety and concern.  

Dr.Damodaran came over to meet us and explained the situation very clearly with the x-ray reports and rationale for the immediate surgery required.  He also explained the situation to my sister who was anxiously waiting over the phone call from the US.  The doctor was extremely patient with us and answered all our questions, which helped us decide to go ahead with the next course of treatment.   

My mom felt a great sense of relief and comfort with the assurance provided by the doctor before the surgery that she will do well.  
By God's grace, the surgery went well.  Immediately after the surgery, the doctor came out of the theatre and showed us the pictures of the implant done to the ankle fracture.  Post 6 weeks of complete bed rest, the doctor suggested a good physiotherapist and gave complete oversight and supervision throughout the sessions.  

Today, we are all so happy to see our mom walk on her own without support.
