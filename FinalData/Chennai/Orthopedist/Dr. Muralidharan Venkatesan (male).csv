Now on the appointment, it ran on time,  Dr.Muralidharan *** ****** ************* ** ***** *** ***** ******* ****** *** made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment
Coming to the main picture, I had a severe leg pain and was unable to walk even a single step, consulted few medical college professors and leading orthos in the city but none could  help me to sort out the issue. Most of them advised pain killers for temporary relief. 
But when I visited Dr.Muralidharan spine surgeon at Chennai Ortho and Spine Center, Adyar he took time and carefully analysed and found out the underlying issue, it was a compressed sciatic nerve that was causing severe pain on my thigh while walking. He explained the whole problem taking time and also advised the practical dos and donts that I need to follow to avoid the problem in future. 
He advised me few physio exercise and vitamin tablets, I recovered 80% the very next day and within a week I was able to do my routines and other tasks regularly.
One of the best thing is, he is extremely knowledgeable and dedicated and is not money motive. He charges a very reasonable cost for the care and service he offers. He takes time for each patient until finding the underlying cause and solution for the same.
If you are looking for a doctor whose medical knowledge is encyclopedic, treats the whole person, and takes the time to be caring even while maintaining a very efficient office, then Dr.Muralidharan is the right person
I would definitely recommend him to anyone that values their health and find the solution for the spine and ortho related issues.
