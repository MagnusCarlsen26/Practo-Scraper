"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My father in law had a serious issue with his spine. He underwent a spine stabilization surgery ** ******  ******** ****** **** in August 2019. Which was an absolute lost cause. We wnet back to again and again to set it right, but to no avail.
By November of 2019 he was almost laid up in bed.. at this time only we were referred to Dr. Muralidaran at apollo hospital Perungudi. We mde an appointment with him and he explained to us in very clear manner what the problem was and also what can be done to set it right.. 
We were sceptical about under going such a mjor surgery again with in 6 months time , considering his 73 years age. 
But Dr. Muralidaran was very confident that it can be performed with very minlmal risk...which in turn gave us confidence m.
He had advised us ,how best the surgery can be done and he had told us that with in 6- 8 weeks he will be able to walk.
Cages and screws were put along the spine at 8 levels . He was in the hospital for 5 days and then he was back home. Where he recaptured very well. As assured by the doctor he was able to walk with help of walker  in 2-3  weeks with in 8 weeks he was able to walk well. 
After surgery visits were also hassle free.. we are so relieved now. He is walking much better with out support and he is able to perform all his work by himself. He had prescribed very little medicine always advising that taking lots of medicine is not good in the long run.
He is also always available if we have any issues or doubt. Very approachable.
We are very thankful to Dr. Muralidaran for his help.
