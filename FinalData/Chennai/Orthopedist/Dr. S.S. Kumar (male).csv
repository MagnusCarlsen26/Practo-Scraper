When i searched about the best doctors i read everyone's review. Then we found Dr S S Kumar.

When i booked the appointment right the follow-up to appointment till I met the doctor, hospital staffs were guiding us properly. Staffs were very friendly and cooperative.

Then I met Dr S S Kumar, he was patiently listening all our problem to diagnose the root cause. Once I finished telling about our problems then he asked us to do X-Ray. 

After the X-Ray, he found the root cause. Most of the doctors asked us to do surgery. But Dr S S Kumar was the only one to tell us it can be cured without surgery and he diagnosed the problem.

I followed up his treatments and visited him for reviews. Gradually i could see the difference in the pain and comfort. I could say I'm cured without any surgery.

When others asked for surgery, he diagnosed the cause and cured me without surgery which is a huge relief for patients.

Thank you Dr S S Kumar and team for the wonderful experience by giving proper treatment and service.

I highly recommend everyone to consult him for all your Ortho problems.

Please note that, Doctor doesn't always fully examine the patient when they are suffering from pain as it will aggregate the pain during the examination, which is why pain killers are precised first. 

As the pain subsides, The final diagnosis is usually made after examination during the second free visit. As it is required in some patients who are in pain during the first visit.

In an outpatient clinic, Doctors don't always have time to know entire history as an in patient. If you felt you had relevant ok history, you should have 
informed at that time.
Please note that, Doctor doesn't always fully examine the patient when they are suffering from pain as it will aggregate the pain during the examination, which is why pain killers are prescripted first. 

As the pain subsides, The final diagnosis is usually made after examination during the second free visit. As it is required in some patients who are in pain during the first visit.

Please note that you haven't visited for the review nor informed us your concern on the same. 

It is disheartening to see such comments against a doctor without undergoing his treatment.
