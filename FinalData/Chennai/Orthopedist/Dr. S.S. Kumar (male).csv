"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Surgery,Spinal Disorders,Spine Injury,Slip Disc,Neck Pain Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Hi.. I have visited the doctor twice once for me and other for my sister. We both have same problem which is disc bulge. For me after thoroughly checking MRI film and reports doctor have suggested the bulge is mild and surgery not required. This can be treated with medicine and physio therapy.
For my sister the disc bulge at L5-S1 is severe and has significant disc bulge in L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels. Before consulting doctor S. S. Kumar we have consulted spine surgeon in CMC vellore and MIOT Chennai. Both the doctors recommended for fusion implantation surgery and that is the best option.
After I gave a consultation with S. S. Kumar sir he examined both patient and reports then he suggested for endoscopy or microscopy surgery can be done to cure this issue and no need to go for open surgery. He explained clearly why we should not go for open surgery clearly as below.
1. Patient is only 29years old
2.As she has multiple bulge along with severe bulge we should not do major surgery which will impact other two discuss.
3.Spine stability is 100% so endoscopy or microscopy is the best option.

The felt like I have saved my sister's life from hospitalized for rest of her years.

When i searched about the best doctors i read everyone's review. Then we found Dr S S Kumar.

When i booked the appointment right the follow-up to appointment till I met the doctor, hospital staffs were guiding us properly. Staffs were very friendly and cooperative.

Then I met Dr S S Kumar, he was patiently listening all our problem to diagnose the root cause. Once I finished telling about our problems then he asked us to do X-Ray. 

After the X-Ray, he found the root cause. Most of the doctors asked us to do surgery. But Dr S S Kumar was the only one to tell us it can be cured without surgery and he diagnosed the problem.

I followed up his treatments and visited him for reviews. Gradually i could see the difference in the pain and comfort. I could say I'm cured without any surgery.

When others asked for surgery, he diagnosed the cause and cured me without surgery which is a huge relief for patients.

Thank you Dr S S Kumar and team for the wonderful experience by giving proper treatment and service.

I highly recommend everyone to consult him for all your Ortho problems.
