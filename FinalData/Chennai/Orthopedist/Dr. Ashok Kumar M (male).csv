None,None,0,0,YES,"We are so grateful to this doctor who spared his time patiently in listening to the complete case history of my father aged 75, ailing with back pain for over 8 months.
 We really owe this doctor for the complete analysis and diagnosis of the prostrate cancer which was metastised to almost all bones in the body. 
He roped in all the specialists to analyse things and after the root cause diagnosis, handed over the case to concerned Urologist who further gave a very cost effective and painless treatment for the underlying disease.
Dr. Ashok Kumar has suggested that the type of prostrate cancer in my dad had a good prognosis and longevity will not be hampered. The words were so warm and consoling for the family hearing a new angle of diagnosis after having multiple opinions at regular intervals.

Thank you so much doctor.
