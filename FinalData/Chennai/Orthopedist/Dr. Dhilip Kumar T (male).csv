"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,","Fracture Treatment,Orthopedic Physiotherapy,",0,0,YES,"DR DILIP TREATED MY WIFE FEW YEARS BACK. SHE HAD MET WITH AN ACCIDENT AND GOT FRACTURED KNEE AND INTERNAL BLEEDING.
ON ADVISE OF MY FRIEND I CONSULTED HIM. 
HIS TREATMENT WAS SIMPLE, VERY MUCH ECONOMICAL AND 
FAST CURING. 
HE MADE HER WALK NORMALLY WITHIN 2 WEEKS. HIS BEST DOSE
OF MEDICINE IS GIVING CONFIDENCE TO THE PATIENTS  THAT
""THIS IS NOTHING, YOU CAN COME OUT OF IT EASILY""
THIS BOOSTS PATIENT'S MORALE AND SELF CONFIDENCE.

REALLY A GEM OF A DOCTOR IN OUR CITY....
