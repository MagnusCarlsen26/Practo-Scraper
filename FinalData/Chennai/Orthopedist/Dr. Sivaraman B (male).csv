"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","ACL Surgery,Meniscus Injury,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Sivaraman is a gem. Trust his skills and follow his lead. He will be there to guide you at all times. My wife(Mar 2023) as well as I (July 2023) had got our ACL surgery done from him last year. We both are doing good. 

My Wife'S Left Leg  ACL Surgery - keyhole surgery:[Mar 2023]

My wife had to undergo ACL surgery last year because of an accidental fall in her past  and she was very worried about the Surgery and its  recovery phase. He was very diligent in addressing all the issues and necessity of the surgery. That was our first visit and we decided to trust him for the surgery. She was able to give full load on her leg the very next day of surgery and slowly walked with a walker.  He has a good team of people who are also very kind. We were discharged in a day and since we live in first floor she wasn't allowed to use stairs atleast for 4 weeks.  Hence he was kind enough to make arrangements to help with surgery dressing. He also arranged home physio and Mrs.Megala was very helpful with exercises and she also helped my wife when she had doubts. My wife recovered gradually and he was there to help us at all time. He never shunned away from clarifying our doubts in phone. 

My right leg ACL Surgery-keyhole surgery (July 2023)

I met with an unfortunate bike accident and fell down from my bike and was not able to stand up in road due to elevated degree of pain. I tried to call him to ask if I can come to any one of his clinic. He said he was in abroad and asked me to go for a first aid. Even when he was in a far away place, patients are always his priority.  I just took a first aid. Took MRI scan as per his advice and went for consultation. My MRI suggested that I had ACL tear. I initially tried to do physio and manage things. Doctor taught me exercises and told to analyse if the surgery has to be done immediately or can be pushed (as I wanted time to process things as ACL recovery phase is hard). At the end I couldn't manage and underwent  ACL surgery. Same team of his doctors and staffs  who operated for my wife were present for me as well.  Recovery was similar to that of my wife.

Recovery phase is approx six months atleast. We both have recovered and doing our every day normal chores without any issues. We were able to go for hike road trips adventure activities without much of a trouble. Physio is mandatory for the recovery. Thanks a bunch to him. Grateful. 

I would recommend him for any ortho problems. He is one of the most friendliest doctor with a sound knowledge.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","partial hip replacement,",0,0,YES,"Sharing the experience of getting my 86 year old father treated for partial hip replacement after a fall.  

Dr Sivaraman advised us to directly reach to the Apollo OMR and communicated to his team to be ready. We reached within an hour to the hospital and his team of doctors immediately initiated the preliminary diagnostics.  Dr Srivaraman arrived at the hospital by then and clearly explained us about the injury and the course of treatment. 

When we were going through this trauma Dr Srivaraman  instilled us with great confidence and assured us that my father will be able to walk with a little support in about six weeks.  Dr Srivaraman patiently attended to our worries. He clearly explained the procedure and also advised us on the risks and precautions.  Immediately after the surgery he explained the success of the surgery, advised the next course of action was in constant touch. 

Iam thankful to his team as well. Throughout our hospitalization for the next three days his team was constantly monitoring my father. They were able to motivate and make my father take a few steps with support over the next three days.  The best part of the connect with the doctor was his genuine concern after the discharge from hospital.

Dr Sivaraman was constantly in touch with me over a phone call or through WhatsApp.  There were times when I have sent him a message with a doubt, and he would call me back as late as 10 pm or even in morning at 6.30 am on a Sunday.  Every alternate day he was monitoring the progress over phone with me as well as through his team who would attend to us at home for dressing and physiotherapy.   
   
Now it is 8 weeks post-surgery and my 86-year-old father is able to resume all his activities and walk inside the house with the help of a walker.  Doctor has even certified that he is even fit to undertake long distance travel by car which we intend to do next month.  

Overall I would rate Dr Sivaraman one of the friendliest, yet most professional  doctor I have met so far.  The confidence that he provides, the assurance and the approachability I guess there is no match to him.
Thank you Doctor.  ",2023-05-30 10:39:04,False,True,Arun Kumar Gopalaswamy,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"I have been a type 1 diabetic for 25+ years and had been suffering from a frozen shoulder for around three years. Since it showed no signs of getting better on its own, I sought help. I did wax therapy, IFT and other exercises but there was no improvement. The only other option that was available to me in my small town  was the capsular release surgery. However I wanted to avoid a surgery given that healing would be take much longer for me as a diabetic. Therefore, I approached Dr. Sivaraman at his clinic where he suggested that I opt for hydrodilation, capsular release and manipulation under anaesthesia.

I agreed with this suggestion and underwent these procedures at Apollo Speciality Hospital, OMR on 4/11/22 with Dr. Sivaraman and his team performing them. The procedures went well and Dr. Sivaraman and his team as well as the hospital staff took good care of me and accomodated all my requests. 

I experienced slight discomfort and pain in the days following the procedures and within a week I was able to lift my arm which was a feat that was impossible for me since 2021. At present I no longer have shoulder pain and my previously frozen shoulder is as mobile as the other one.

As someone in an age group (I was 30 years old at the time these procedures were carried out) that usually does not experience a frozen shoulder, I did not have the option to ask other people of their experience in dealing with this issue. Instead, I placed my trust in Dr. Sivaraman's qualifications and his extensive experience and I am glad I did that!",2023-02-23 08:42:22,False,True,Anna. T.,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Meniscus Injury,Ligament Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,I had a ligament tear back in 2014 while playing Volleyball and in MRI it was confirmed that a partial tear had occurred. Then I visited few doctors and they conveyed ligament tear has the ability to cure naturally but you have go through strengthening exercise with a physiotherapist. I did not take it seriously and after 4 years when I played Badminton once again back in August 2019 the same tear became a complete one. Tried natural treatment for 2 months but the pain kept on creeping. Then took an MRI and met Dr Shivaram from Chettinad after seeing reviews in Practo. The moment I met him the way he greeted me took me by surprise. He was so down to earth and listened to my entire history. He said it's better to go for surgery since meniscus had blood cloth. I immediately agreed for the operation he sent the confirmation to insurance desk within few hours and he was so supportive in this approval process. His turn around time was unbelievable. I was operated in November 2019. The operation was delayed by few hours. He visited me when I was in the waiting room and informed me about the delay. During entire operation he was enquiring about my stability and if there was anything am feeling uncomfortable.Once after being changed to room he visited and for the next two days he took care of me with utmost kindness.Even today he calls me and enquires about my recovery process and am feeling much better as days pass by. One of the best orthopedic doctors and probably the best doctor I have met in my life. Doctors have a godly image and when you meet someone close to that then you are privileged.If you are suffering from ligament tear and meniscus tear without any 2nd hopes reach to this doctor and get yourself better.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. SivaRaman was the one who treated me when I had met with an accident on 07/12/2018.
He investigated on my left leg little toe which was deformed and let me know clearly on the treatment options available. He also suggested the importance of K-Wire taping for my broken little toe bone. That was the first time I had met with an accident in my life.
At first, I thought there might be some surgery required to fix my bone. But, Dr.SivaRaman boosted my confidence by saying, ""Nothing to worry. K-Wire taping is a small procedure and it would take hardly half an hour! Post which you can walk in 6 weeks."" His convincing tone gave me enough strength to undertake the procedure.
My heart was beating faster due to shock when I was taken to Operation Theatre. I was shivering in shock and requested the nurses and assistants who accompanied me to the theatre to reduce the air-conditioner and give me additional bed-sheets. But those folks didn't do that indeed. I even told them I have to urinate. But they told me that doctor will come in few minutes and didn't respond to my words.
When Dr.SivaRaman arrived and saw me shivering, he told to reduce air-conditioner and immediately gave me another bedsheet. His connetion with the patient was much appreciable as he had understood the feelings of the patient. I asked him I need to urinate and he started the procedure once I am ready to start with and had not hurried. He had ensured all items in checklist were met before he started the procedure. The procedure was completed painlessly and he showed me the X-ray with K-Wire after the procedure is completed. The next day visit of the doctor and the way he had explained the recovery procedure was admirable.
I would 100 percent recommend Dr.SivaRaman to all my friends and relatives.
He is so patient-friendly, answerable to all our queries and the most comfortable doctor to reach out to. Overall, he is an inspiring doctor and a humble person with genuine heart.

I was in Hyderabad and it was complicated to arrange to take her out to hospital appointments in an ambulance and due to Covid times, the risk was higher. I just found Dr Sivaraman on Practo and explained the situation to him. For the next 6 months, Dr Sivaraman went OUT OF HIS WAY to take up my mother as his patient. He saw her a couple of times at his clinic ensuring that she is safe from Covid risks by seeing her at the entrance only. He worked on a treatment plan and constantly kept in touch with me and the doctors at her geriatric facility over phone and whatsapp and I cannot thank him enough for the patience and simplicity that he displayed throughout this time. Finally she had to go in for surgery and Dr again went out of his way to operate on her at her resident hospital. The surgery happened very smoothly with the best outcome for my mother - where many other doctors had expressed doubts that removing a metal implant after 25 years would be complicated.
