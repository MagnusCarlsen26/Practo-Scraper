"Wait time,","Knee care,",0,0,NO,Bad experience from ur hospital we had to wait 2 hours to show the report when yo cant cordinate well with the patients and why you ask to wait for hours. We pay and go for treatment and yo dont give it us for free. Yo guys dont even understand the pain of the patient. This is my 1st n last visit to you hospital.
