"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Pain Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Problem statement : Am in my early 40s who follows very strict lifestyle, be it food, exercise, sleep, work life balance etc. During Covid my routine changed with lack of exercises. Post Covid when I started working out, my knees weren’t supportive. I started feeling heaviness around my knees when I jog or jump

My experience: Ojas hospital building gets more than 5* for the interiors and architecture. You will feel entering a 7* hotel. All staffs are very kind and professional. They answer every question you ask without slacking.

I had to wait for 45 mins approx. for the consultation (this is ok because doctors schedules can’t be on the point). When I met the doctor he was very kind and attentive in listening to my problem statement. He recommended x-ray to diagnose my issue.

When the x-ray was out he prescribed physiotherapy and mild medications. I am not convinced with his diagnosis or his explanation for my problem. I have pain in both my knees while the doctor gave the root cause only for one knee which I am not convinced. His explanation wasn’t detailed to a layman person.

Wish doctor explained me clearly the cause and the diagnosis statement. May be it’s too early for him to conclude?

I am glad for others who are very much satisfied with his treatment while am looking for such good experience. Hope during my next review session he will explain things more clearly",2023-05-18 07:19:10,False,False,Maheswari M,,,

 I have had tremendous pain for years and been in and out of MRI scanners. I learnt about DR Ashwin from one of my friends and had an appointment with him on 04/04/2022, He told me that though I had some physiological issues, the pain was mainly aggravated by stress. He suggested yoga as the MAGIC KEY to all my pains. I was surprised and wasn't sure of what to expect. But I believed that it would be the best way ahead as he reassured me that things would be better soon with yoga.  Both me and my husband are every so grateful to DR Ashwin for all his help.
