None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr Barani is a great orthopedician and spine surgeon. More than that a lovely human. He treated my wife, for her disc problem who suffered for quite a few years. We had approached him for my Wife long spending spine issues. Though we had been to multiple orthopedicians, who treated my wife condition as disc prolapse, it was Dr Barani who, in the first visit itself, came to the correct diagnosis and offered the correct treatment advise. With the surgical treatment and post operative care she's all thee more to normalcy now. I recommend the doctor for all spine and disc related problems.
