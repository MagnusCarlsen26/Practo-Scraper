None,"Bone Fracture,",0,0,YES,"Excellent Doctor !! Had met with a road accident that resulted in left forearm bone fracture & which required surgery with metal plates to be inserted. Consider extremely fortunate to have landed in the safe hands of Dr. Ravi.  Explained in detail the injury/ surgery to be done and most importantly very approachable and a great comfort level.  Perfect diagnosis too, had a nerve compression in my right hand & it was  Doctor who identified it and put us on to a Neurologist to sort things. My physiotherapy is on at present and with Dr. Ravi around very confident of coming back to my usual self very soon. Highly recommended. Go ahead even without any second thoughts !!",2016-02-21 03:13:45,False,True,Siddharth M Rao,,,
