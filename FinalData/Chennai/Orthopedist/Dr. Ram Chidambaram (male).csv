"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Shoulder Dislocation Repair,",0,0,YES,"**** *** **** ** *** ***** **** ** ***** ** ******** ******* ** ********* My wife dislocated her right shoulder badly due to successive episodes of seizures. On examining further, her shoulder cup had cracks. We were fearing it'd be replaced by a titanium implant. Thank God! Dr. RC restored the original configuration; reviewed and followed up to guide us through the process in an impeccable manner. We're very, very happy and are thankful to him!

I'll surely recommend the doctor for any shoulder related issues. **** *** ***** ",2021-05-13 20:45:25,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
