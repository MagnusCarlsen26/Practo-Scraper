I was suggested to go for operation in an other hospital.  Then i visited Dr.  He spent close to 30 minutes during consultation asked so many questions about nature of job, hobbies, travel, sports activities, habits etc. Later Dr suggested that operation is not required for my life style and suggested physiotheraphy and exercises.
