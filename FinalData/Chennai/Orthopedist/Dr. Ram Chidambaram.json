One vehicle hit me hard. I could not bear the pain . i was diagnosed with some malunited fracture and stiffness of elbow. I was stunned. I managed to go back home and then i went to my native person   they applied slab but unfortunately it dint work for me . And i came to Dr Ram Chidambaram with one of my senior officer . he explained my problem in detail. he tole me he will do metal work removal and arthrolysis of elbow. He spoke to him and today my hand is all fine i am able to move my hand freely . I am very much relaxed my hand movement is very good i had lost all my hopes of getting back to normal. Sometimes like a blessing we get people like Dr Ram Chidambaram  who gave back my life now i am only given fit for light duties hopefully i start my work back.Thanks to the Miot Hopsital and Dr Ram Chidambaram for both Moral support and Treatment. I like him because he sees us like a human being and not just like patient he spends time for us . Make some jokes . Make my mind free . and then tell me the problem and treatment. He is a great man and a great doctor too thanks doctor Ram  . ....!!!!!!!!!!!! i want to move my hand 100 %",

He spoke to him and today my hand is all fine i am able to move my hand freely . I am very much relaxed my hand movement is very good i had lost all my hopes of getting back to normal. Sometimes like a blessing we get people like Dr Ram Chidambaram  who gave back my life now i am only given fit for light duties hopefully i start my work back.Thanks to the Miot Hopsital and Dr Ram Chidambaram for both Moral support and Treatment. I like him because he sees us like a human being and not just like patient he spends time for us . Make some jokes . Make my mind free . and then tell me the problem and treatment.

On examining further, her shoulder cup had cracks. We were fearing it'd be replaced by a titanium implant. Thank God! Dr. RC restored the original configuration; reviewed and followed up to guide us through the process in an impeccable manner. We're very, very happy and are thankful to him!\n\nI'll surely recommend the doctor for any shoulder related issues. **** *** ***** ",
