A very friendly doctor, zero alarm ie..however worried or concerned I was about a condition, he explained it so clearly and satisfactorily that i gained maximum confidence, my mental state was strengthened that even my healing process was so fast! I can now drive, walk anywhere, stand for as long as i want, climb hills etc in short, live my life comfortably after treatment. Kudos to the doctor. The hospital was very comfortable.
