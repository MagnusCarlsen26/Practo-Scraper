For my nagging right shoulder pain for the past 1 year and (after exhausting all conservative and other treatments)  I decided to undergo Arthroscopy surgery by Dr Jaheer Hussain. \n He meticulously and patiently went  through my reports, MRI etc and explained in detail what exactly my problem is and how he is going to perform the surgery through  his video presentation and how the problems are going to be fixed. I underwent surgery 6 weeks back and from day one I was confident that I was under safe hands. After succeesful surgery now I am in stage 3 of physio therapy,  sling removed and there is remarkable recovery. There was no problem  at all in the shoulder excepting very minor pain which i managed without pain killers . I should express my gratitude to Dr and his assistant\n Dr Prabhu and the friendly  reception team . I should thank the Almighty for taking me to this hospital.",

For my nagging right shoulder pain for the past 1 year and (after exhausting all conservative and other treatments)  I decided to undergo Arthroscopy surgery by Dr Jaheer Hussain. \n He meticulously and patiently went  through my reports, MRI etc and explained in detail what exactly my problem is and how he is going to perform the surgery through  his video presentation and how the problems are going to be fixed. I underwent surgery 6 weeks back and from day one I was confident that I was under safe hands. After succeesful surgery now I am in stage 3 of physio therapy,  sling removed and there is remarkable recovery. There was no problem  at all in the shoulder excepting very minor pain which i managed without pain killers . I should express my gratitude to Dr and his assistant\n Dr Prabhu and the friendly  reception team . I should thank the Almighty for taking me to this hospital.",
