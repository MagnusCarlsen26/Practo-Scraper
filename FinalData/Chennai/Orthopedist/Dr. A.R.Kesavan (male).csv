,,0,0,YES,"I had a serious lower back pain and siatica for more than one year before I met Dr A R Kesavan. Before that I have consulted several doctors including Apollo, where one famous surgen advised me surgery. He prescribed me some medicines including multi minerals tablet, use of medical belt and one week full rest. After a week I was feeling better and started short walking. Slowly I started getting better and restarted my exercisers and stopped the use of belt in 15 days. Now I am perfectly normal.",2021-09-29 18:00:17,False,True,Krishan Pal Singh,,,
