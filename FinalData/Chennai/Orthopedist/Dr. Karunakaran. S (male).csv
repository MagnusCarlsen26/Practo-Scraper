"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Spinal Surgery,Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I am Shyamala U, 69 yr old woman who had a fall 4 months back. I had severe back pain and found it difficult to get up from bed and do other regular activities. An orthopedic doctor I consulted diagnosied that my spine had a compression fracture and advised that I wear a brace. But there was no relief from my pain. My daughtet after online search zeroed in on Dr. Karunakaran. He is a down to earth person. He listened patiently when I explained my difficulties due to the pain. His kind and encouraging words gave me the courage to go through D11 to L1 percutaneous pedicle screw fixation done under GA which was decided after a series of tests, x rays and scans. 
After the surgery on 17th Aug 2021 his advices and approach were extraordinary to me. His team of doctors is also excellent.
Post surgery I felt immense relief from pain within a couple of days.
So I strongly recommend Dr. Karunakaran for any spine related problems and one can rest assured of positive outcome within a short period.
