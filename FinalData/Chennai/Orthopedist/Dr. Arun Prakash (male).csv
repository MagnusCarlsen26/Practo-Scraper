"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"I know him (Dr.Arun Prakash) for almost 7 years. He doesn't waste your time.  He is very quick and reliable. No stories, but he listen to his patients. He also takes time to explain to the patient and the attender about the problem and the treatment to be given.  He is not money minded. Service comes first.  When my father met with an accident and broke his legs, he was the one who operated and fixed it.  This time, my spouse fell down and suffered from ligament tear. He operated and fixed it. Both are fine now. Thanks to Dr. Arun.",2017-06-28 13:39:24,False,True,Murugan,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","ORIF,",0,0,YES,"I know Dr Arun Prakash from Feb 2011. My wife and I met with a major accident, and my wife had fractures on her left knee. It was a very sensitive time and Dr Arun had consoled us, explained in detail of the condition of the fracture and the treatment procedures. He had implanted three screws (ORIF) inside her knees and made her walk without any support (walker etc) in 6 months with continuous follow-ups and physiotherapy. 

In general that the implants supposed to be removed within a stipulated time (i.e within 3 years) from the time of implantation. However, due to my wife’s pregnancy and personal challenges, we had postponed the implants removal as many times. We were very much worried as it had been many years over and thinking of the complexity of the operation / removal of implants. However, Dr Arun had removed those three screws completely at Murugan Hospitals in Kilpauk in Oct 2018 and made my wife walk in few days. 

Last but not least that I would thank every staffs at the Murugan hospitals. They were very friendly (be it duty Doctors, Nurses, Helpers & housekeeping staffs) and polite in attending / responding us. 

Thank you very much Dr Arun Sir!
