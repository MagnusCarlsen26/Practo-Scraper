"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Consultation provided for newborns ,Paediatric Emergency  Care,Pediatrics Critical Care,Childhood Infections,Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,YES,"I owe this review to Neonatologist  Dr. Shrishailesh Mantur

We were blessed with twin babies on 2nd October 2020  at Apollo cradle Koramangala,  it was premature delivery of 32 weeks with babies' weights of 1.01 and 1.05.

we were sure from the words of Dr. Mekhala our gyno that nothing to worry about because Dr. Shrishailesh Mantur is there to take care of the babies.

NICU team were prepared well in advance, after birth they monitored and took extreme care of babies with proper counseling given to us each day.

Its always a tense situation for parents to see babies in NICU, but the timely treatment where instances of low HB blood transfusion were very well managed, necessary tests and scans were done to avoid further complications, proper information was given to us and I need to say this Apollo cradle is blessed to have such doctors. 

Dr. Shrishailesh gives us the comfort to ask endless queries, his confidence in treatment sets him as the best Neonatologist.

My babies stayed in NICU for 45 days and were discharged with the weight of 1.7 and 1.65, they were blessed to be taken care of so well by the best Neonatologist and NICU nurses who are always there 24hrs.

also while discharge they guided us with follow-up plans, vaccinations & feeding plans.

Thanks a ton, doctor !!

He is very patient and kind. He diagnoses the problem properly, will listen to the parents very patiently.

We have gone for all the vaccinations to him. You can easily reach to him over a phone call incase of any confusion / followup if you are staying far.

I have reached out to him many times when my kid falls ill and sometimes I am satisfied only after consulting him. 
One thing that stands out in him is that he is very passionate about his profession, very dedicated and sincere. To him it is very important to treat the kid right and he is not the one who does things for financial benefit. 
I remember he helped one of my friend’s daughter over a phone call during an emergency late in the night. He was on the call till my friends reached hospital by giving directions & he had spoken to the hospital in parallel & arranged a doctor by the time my friends reached the hospital in the night.
