"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Nandini Nagar has been a very comfortable doctor who understands the illness well and does not panic the parents. she gives logical reason and symptoms and remedy which could be tried before hospital visits. Does not ask us to visit unnecessarily for hospital, and she would respond comfortably on a call or on whats-app. 
She was treating my daughter earlier and now our new born son.

when it comes to New born / kids, we parents often tend to get tensed up. She would ease us and comfort by explaining the illness, causes and when we need to be cautious.  
My son was supposed to be admitted at hospital, he was not even a month old, however other would have insisted us to admit , but Nandini Nagar understands parents feelings, she did not take admission however responded well on phone call and whats-app. End of the day we all see for a good doctor who is ************** having patience,  good experience, interactive, genuine, reasonable and comfortable doctor.

I would strongly say that her kai guna   is very good (when she gives vaccination, my son has less pain compared to other doctor).

None,"Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,NO,"Would not recommend this doctor to anyone. Had travelled all the way from Sarjapur Road to Cloudnine Jayanagar to get the ear piercing done for my 6 month old daughter.
I was asked by the practo team to be at the clinic 30 mins before the appointment as there is some gel that needs to be applied. We were a bit late and reached just 20 mins before the appointment. After 45mins, the doctor's tells us that her shift now ends and she cannot wait for the gel to take effect, which needed another 15-20 mins to completely numb the area.

She said that either we can get the piercing done now (without the ear being completely numb) or  come again some other day. Despite asking her repeatedly on what would she recommend to be the best way for my daughter, she was not straightforward enough to say that we should not do it without the ear being completely numb not was she courteous enough to give more weightage to the pain that a 6month old baby may undergo just because she cannot wait for 15 more mins.
I decided not to go by such a doctor and got the piercing done by another doctor at the same clinic with a lot of difficulty.
