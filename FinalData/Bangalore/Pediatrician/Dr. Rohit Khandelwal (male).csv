None,"Weight Gain Diet Counseling,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Rohit Khandelwal when our baby was 5.5 months old. We just returned back from Mangalore and the sudden change in climate gave her a severe cold. What we most liked about Dr. Rohit is his patience in taking us through his diagnosis, addressing all our queries with a smile on his face and never rushing through an appointment. 

As first time parents, he instilled in us the confidence to battle our baby's various health issues. My daughter had some digestive issues because wheat was introduced early in her diet. She drastically lost a lot of weight and was always constipated. Once he identified the cause, he guided us through the right steps to follow.

The medicines he prescribes, only if necessary, are of minimum dosage. He encourages a healthy diet and home-made food. The diet charts he shares are very informative and useful.

Today, we have a happy and healthy child and a major share of the credit goes to Dr. Rohit.

We also visit him for our baby's regular immunizations and it has never been chaotic.

Thumbs up to Dr. Rohit!
