In this situation of Covid every where outside we took virtual appointment with Dr.  Bharat with the doubt in our mind that how he is going to diagnose the cause for fever on video call... But it was extremely satisfactory.  The explanation of doctor made us calm n relaxed and my baby was fine after 2 days of medication. Thanks dr Bharat for your genuine care towards my little one",

Not just that, the nurse had to call the doctor to ask him to come to the clinic. He started inquiring the nurse what the visit was about. Since the nurse said it'd take him 5 mins to arrive. We went to the shop above the clinic. It had been 3 mins, and doctor arrived at the clinic. He didn't even have the patience to wait till the nurse to call. He just left the clinic. We came within a min of receiving the call. And the doctor was gone! Don't want to judge but if he really have to attend our baby we would've come the next day. Very rude! ",

When we reached the clinic, doctor was not there. Why have a slot open at 6PM if the doctor is not available at the clinic? Not just that, the nurse had to call the doctor to ask him to come to the clinic. He started inquiring the nurse what the visit was about. Since the nurse said it'd take him 5 mins to arrive. We went to the shop above the clinic. It had been 3 mins, and doctor arrived at the clinic. He didn't even have the patience to wait till the nurse to call. He just left the clinic. We came within a min of receiving the call. And the doctor was gone! Don't want to judge but if he really have to attend our baby we would've come the next day. Very rude! ",
