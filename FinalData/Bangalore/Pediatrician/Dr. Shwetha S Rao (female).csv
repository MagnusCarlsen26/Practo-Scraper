"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Shwetha is excellent and her approach to treatment is very methodical. She is my family doctor and I'm very thankful to have her treat both my kids. 

Special thanks to her great help when my 2 month old son was very sick and on the verge of getting admitted when Dr.Shwetha gave the right kind of treatment and we could manage him at home and he was back to normal within 24 hours. Much different than most others

Her diagnosis is more pre-emptive than reactive
