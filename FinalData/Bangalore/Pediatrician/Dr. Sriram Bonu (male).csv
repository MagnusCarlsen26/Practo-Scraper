None,None,0,0,YES,"I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Sriram Bonu at Apollo Brookfield in Bangalore, and I couldn't be more impressed with the care and compassion he showed. As a pediatrician, Dr. Bonu is not only highly ************* *** professional, but he also has an incredible ability to connect with his patients and their families.

From the moment we walked into his office, Dr. Bonu made us feel at ease with his warm and empathetic demeanor. He took the time to listen to our concerns, answer all our questions, and thoroughly explain the treatment plan in a way that was easy to understand. His genuine care and attention to detail truly set him apart.

Dr. Bonu's approach is patient-centered, and he goes above and beyond to ensure that every child receives the best possible care. He is incredibly thorough in his examinations and has a knack for making even the most anxious patients feel comfortable.

We are incredibly grateful for the outstanding care Dr. Bonu provided and would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a compassionate and skilled pediatrician. Thank you, Dr. Bonu, for your exceptional service and for making a difference in our child's health and well-being.",2024-08-08 07:54:00,False,True,Ravinder ,,,
