"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pediatric Vaccinations,Newborn Jaundice,",0,0,NO,"Have visited to doctor twice, both time had to wait for 1 hour from appointment time.
1st time for showing for jaundice and regular follow up after birth, he just saw the report checked by nurses from external devices. Didn’t even examined the baby, didn’t even touch him and just wrote some medicines. And there was no communication with us (parents) as well. Was very surprised by this.

Next we visited another doctor ****** **** ** **** ********* **** ****** *** *********** ** ****** *** ************ my wife didn’t remembered doctor’s name at that moment and hospital mentioned Prashant Gowda, so we booked appointment with him. 

This time also, he came very late, didn’t had any communication with us or examined the baby, just put the vaccination without consoling/diverting the kid. Felt very robotic and no empathy. 

Both time he just pointed to his hospital and shared number of his hospital. And I think this is the only thing he spoke to us. 

This was my last time I visited to him. But as it happened twice I felt its better to share the experience and feedback.

I amount of time he spent to write down the number for appointment is more than the amount of time he spent to check the baby.
When we went to the skin specialist her expression was like “really for this”.
