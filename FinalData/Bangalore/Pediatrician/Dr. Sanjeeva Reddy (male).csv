"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Newborn Jaundice,",0,0,YES,"I came across Dr.Sanjeeva Reddy quite accidentally. My 13-day old son was suffering from Jaundice and his regular paediatrician was out of town. Someone suggested Dr.Sanjeeva Reddy(thank god for that!).
He diagnosed accurately and had my son admitted immediately. With personal interest and dedication, he cured my son soon. After that I never went back to my son's regular paediatrician. I find him warm, approachable and very committed.My son is now a 5 year old. In these 5 years, several times when he has suffered from cold, cough, fever, stomach problems, I just had to pick the phone and call this doctor. Every time he has received the calls and guided me.Never once has he ignored my call. Tell me, how many doctors will do that in this busy world that we are living in. I would absolutely recommend him to all!
