I am seeing him since my daughter’s birth and I don’t listen to anyone but Dr. vikas. Very patient, very positive, very encouraging. He will look at baby’s face (color, skin, dullness) and tell the problem.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,NO,"We wanted to like Dr. Satwik and his clinic, but after 3 visits for vaccinations we can't recommend his care if you have other options.

The good:
The clinic is clean and everyone is trying vary hard. It is attached to Motherhood so you have access to any facilities you could want including a pharmacy and specialists. Dr. Satwik is technically excellent so if you don't have any other option at least know his medical training is top notch.

The bad:
We always call ahead because we are travelling quite far, but we always wind up waiting and need to be ""squeezed in"". It's not surprising given how busy they are, but another good reason to find a smaller clinic. Some easy ways to improve service include 1) vaccination days, 2) allow child measuring, pharmacy pickup, and checkin to be done simultaneously, and 3) have enough doctors on staff to accommodate overruns.

I am a high stress first time mother, but I do not appreciate metal health diagnosis from a non-psychiatrist doctor or his staff. We've been here 3 times and aside from the first visit Dr. Satwik hasn't listened preferring ""just do this"" and don't ask why answers.
