"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fever,",0,0,YES,"Had a wonderful experience with the Doctor.She was really friendly and wasn't just filling in an appointment slot. Even before asking about the actual problem, she ensued that she knows about all other details about the child such as past problems, diet etc. Coming to the actual problem, she never was in a hurry to listen and prescribe. She listened to the problem and subsequent questions very patiently and answered all of them in detail. Whether the treatment works or not is secondary but the intent and content of the doctor matters and thats where she has been a wonderful person. In my experience with most doctors at Bangalore, they expect us to book another appointment in order to ask follow up questions. But Dr Tejaswini never had any such expectations. In fact when I booked another appointment after 4 days, she asked me why did I book another appointment. This was very kind and ethical of her and builds a trust that she will not prescribe any unnecessary treatments or tests etc.Coming to the actual treatment, Dr was really thorough and told me all stages of treatment. She didn't prescribe all tests etc for the first day itself and asked us to wait before getting tests and subsequent medications.Glad to have found her for my child.Thank you!
