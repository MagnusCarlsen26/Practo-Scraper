I was visiting because I wanted to be assured of my child's progress as we hadn't seen a doctor for almost 6months.

The session was smooth until the Dr asked my child if she could put a stethoscope on my child to check her chest. My child is weary of strangers so at this point she cried and when the Dr went ahead my child made a hitting action. Of course I told my child that this behaviour was uncalled for. I think the Dr at this point got very angry because she started taking the conversation towards my child being autistic. Then she said ""oh, but she is making eye contact... So maybe not autistic..."" she asked me if my child had any difficulty in school because of her behaviour... I said that she had adjusted in school and the teachers in fact have told me that she does all her activities diligently.
