1.This was our 2nd check up post my baby's birth.
My baby had developed some red granular rashes on his face, chin and neck side. She gave one ointment to apply over but that didn't help even after using it for 13 days and it turned to some watery itchy eruptions as if the skin is burnt.

2. My breast milk production was not enough to feed my baby in every 2 hrs for 10-15 mins. This was a major concern for me as no one would like to keep her baby hungry. So I needed some guidance for formula feeding. To this i didn't get any suggestions on correct quantity and frequency based on age and weight. She gave one medicine for 10 days to increase milk but that too didn't help much after taking it upto 5 days. 
I understand bm is best for babies and she was trying to help my baby with mother's milk but mother's who don't have much milk have to depend on formula and giving formula to infants defenitely require some guidance on quantity and frequency which we didn't get from her. Initial days were traumatic for me as my milk didn't help my baby much and the formula feed given to him was completely based on guidance written on pack.
