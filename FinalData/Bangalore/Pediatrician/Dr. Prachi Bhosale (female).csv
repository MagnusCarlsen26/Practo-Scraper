"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr Prachi - A hope as pleasant as rising sun which spreads light and life in this planet, a source of energy. 
She is real angel, which I saw in human form. Her caring, well being, health oriented, approach and attitude towards kids heals the kid faster. 

Specially in my kid, where she was underweight and frequent illness during initial one year after birth, we approached Dr. Prachi. She not only heard us patiently but asked us many questions related to lifestyle and kid's behavior, which helped to find out the root cause as well as cure my kid forever. Now my kid is hale and hearty with stronger immune system. Words are not enough to appreciate your humble caring attitude. Whenever I see my kid smile and playful, I know, Dr Prachi is behind this heavenly feeling which we feel as parents. 

You are the true living epitome of hope, devotion and care.
