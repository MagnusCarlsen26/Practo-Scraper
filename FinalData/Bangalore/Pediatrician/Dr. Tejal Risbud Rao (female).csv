She is affable, compassionate, and best of all, friendly with babies and toddlers, which creates an amicable environment for smooth and effective check-ups. Recently, my toddler was diagnosed with a Preauricular Sinus, and Dr. Tejal’s medication and advice were right on the money. Finding an exemplary Pediatrician like Dr. Tejal is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. With our hands on our hearts, we are grateful to Dr. Tejal for her outstanding care for our toddler.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Tejal has a very relaxed demeanour which brings a calming influence - a great quality to have for a paediatrician, given most of us parents get very worried for no reason. She answers all questions with utmost patience and also answers queries on WhatsApp in timely manner - which helped me to take care of my baby without getting panicked when my husband was away and I couldn't visit hospital. Given we are first time parents, it was great to have a Doctor who understands our anxieties and is always available to calm us. I would definitely recommend her.",2018-10-08 05:56:47,False,True,Shilpi Chhabra,,,
