,,0,0,YES,The accessibility to Dr Neha jain is worth a million bucks! We have never had any issues getting our kid in when she need to see her and have always felt very confident in her care. She has a very ************* *** friendly staff. I would (and do)recommend rainbow to anyone looking for a pediatrician.,2024-05-03 07:34:15,False,True,Sambit Nayak,,,
,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Neha is child-centric, methodical, and very diligent in her approach. We had reached out to her when my child had contracted Dengue and the platelets had dropped too low. The way she guided us through the entire treatment of the child was amazing, her calmness and confidence alleviated all our anxiousness. She cares to explain the reason behind every medication that is prescribed and the rationale behind the diagnosis. We would highly recommend Dr. Neha.",2022-01-03 16:21:44,False,True,Vinita S Kulkarni,,,
