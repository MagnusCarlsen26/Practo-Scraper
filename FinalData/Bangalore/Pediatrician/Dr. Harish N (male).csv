None,None,0,0,YES,"I am consulting doctor Harish for the last 12 years for my daughter (now 16yo) and son (now 12 yo).  He gives sufficient time and his diagnosis, explanation and treatment is very effective, he prescribes minimal medicine and as parents we are totally satisfied.

None,None,0,0,NO,"One of the bad experiences with this doctor. We met him for vaccine of my daughter. She was afraid to go inside the clinic. His assistant came and tried pulling my daughter, once I asked to leave my kid his assistant went inside. Later when I took my daughter inside doctor has not even took an attempt to make my daughter relaxed. They took her to table and gave her vaccine with brute force. I expect a better experience.
