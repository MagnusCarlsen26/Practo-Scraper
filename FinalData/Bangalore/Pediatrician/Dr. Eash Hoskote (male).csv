We visited Ovum hospital for consultation with Dr Eash Hoskote on Monday evening during which he suggested blood test for a range of issues as the high fever had not subsided for over 4 days.  Vrishank's matter was handled with great care by both the duty doctor on Tuesday who consulted with Dr Eash and suggested him getting hospitalized for further monitoring and care.
