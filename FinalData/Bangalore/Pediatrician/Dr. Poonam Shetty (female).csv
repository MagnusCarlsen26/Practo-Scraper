"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Childhood Infections,",0,0,YES,"I have always visited Dr. Poonam at Apollo and would highly recommend  her mainly because she does not believe in prescribing unnecessary medicines. For constipation in my 2 yr old, she insisted on potty training over medicines which really helped. When i visited for bacterial infection which was 3 days old, she immediately prescribed the antibiotic which was the need of the hour instead of waiting for another 3 days which some other doctors prefer. That approach may not help with toddlers as they already become quite weak in first two days of fever and throat infection. And she is a friendly person and responds when my son wishes her which says a lot about her.  ",2019-02-05 05:24:13,False,True,Rajshree Mishra,,,
