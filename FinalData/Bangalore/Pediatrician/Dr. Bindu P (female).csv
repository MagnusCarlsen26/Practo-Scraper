It was so surprising *** ****** *** *** ***** **** ***** ************ Then comes the second chapter, we asked to inspect our baby and doctor was not asking us to put baby on the inspection table and check her. Instead baby was sitting in our lap and she even checked her tummy health while baby is sitting!! Unbelievable, there is no basic health concept here!!!
Later got shocked by seeing the baby food products they sell in their little pharmacy. All baby food contains animal fats and protein which is deleterious for infants!! There is no basic standard in this place. Please check every single detail before accepting anything from this clinic.
