If in case there is a condition, he explains it in detail to the parents before starting the treatment which helps us understand why we are doing something for the baby. Also, he's always available on call during emergency and responds back to messages quickly which avoids unnecessary visits to the hospital. \nIn my personal opinion, as parents we love to give the best care to our babies and with a paed who understands the baby's health so well, we wouldn't be compromising on healthcare :) ",

If in case there is a condition, he explains it in detail to the parents before starting the treatment which helps us understand why we are doing something for the baby. Also, he's always available on call during emergency and responds back to messages quickly which avoids unnecessary visits to the hospital. \nIn my personal opinion, as parents we love to give the best care to our babies and with a paed who understands the baby's health so well, we wouldn't be compromising on healthcare :) ",
