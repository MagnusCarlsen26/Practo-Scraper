"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"We have been going to Dr.Meghna Manocha for years now - for both our sons, one is 10 and the other 5. I don't know what I would do had she not been around. She is SO good. I trust her implicitly, and whenever I have had any doubt about any medical issues with my kids, I have gone to her and been relieved about my kids being in the best of care. 

A couple of times when due to the distance and immediate requirement I had to go to someone else, I remember how I could only rest assured when we saw her after a couple of days anyway. She is just very very nice as a person and as a doctor, she is professional, and thorough but in such an easy-going manner. The combination is so calming for parents, and so relieving to know that your kids are in the best of care. Besides all this, my kids love her.

My older son was born under Dr.Arvind Shenoi's care and I am ever ever grateful to him, I look up to him and admire his skill. Having Dr.Meghna on his team just re-affirms my trust, they are the best.
