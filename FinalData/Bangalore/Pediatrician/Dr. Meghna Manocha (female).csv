My kid fail down and got hurt in the forehead. By consulting near by hospital (speciality hospital) a dr I gave medicine. But thn my kid had diarrhea and vomitting. We did ultrasound. After 2times of ultrasound the dr told that some obstacle is thr in kid's stomach so meed to do citiscan and surgery. I was schocked and thank god before further process I was to be sure by consulting another hospital.
Whn I reached cloudnine dr Meghna's consultation time was over. So in emergency I consulted another dr. But I was praying to see once her. And thanks to god and her whn she came to emergency room I was so happy that my tension went. She was so humble even her dutu time was over she checked my kid and as my kid was passing motion and gas so she told nothing to b worried. Thn there again we did ultrasound and it was gastric no obstacle. After this also she personally waited for another 2hrs to further consult senior specialist and when everything clarified as normal thn only she went. 

I am really thankful to you dr Meghna how I became relaxed when you told no surgery required which was earlier told by other dr.  You treat patients like family not just like others.So everytime I prefer you snd also advise others. Thank you.",2020-07-18 11:08:59,False,True,Divyansh ,,,

We feel its her passion towards profession that drives this excellence. Can not thank her enough for the critical diagnosis that she made in case of our 1.5 year old child that too in a very short time span. She made us understand the urgency of the matter and for that she gave us time on Sunday despite being holiday for her. Her profession for her is way beyond just the duty as a doctor. She simply loves her little patients.
Everytime we visit her, there is always an assurance that our little kids are in extremely safe hands.  ",2020-12-18 05:29:10,False,True,Yamini Darwhekar,,,
