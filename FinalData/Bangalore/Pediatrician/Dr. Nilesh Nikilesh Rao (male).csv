"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Cough In Children,",0,0,NO,"We waited for 45 mins to see Dr Nilesh for my sons cough, cold, weight gain & allergy problems. We were called in and he examined the childs cough and asked questions on symptoms. After that, when we were about to tell him the next problem the child was facing when he interupted and called the next patient. But I insisted that my child has some rash. So, he suddenly got impatient and rudely replied that we should have told this before. He did not even examine my child and turned the other way without acknowledging.

Most of the time, he will only talk and not let patient describe the complaints.

He was in hurry to move on to next patient. We travelled 1hr, waited 1hr, paid 850, appointment  finished in 2 mins.  He doesn't spare 2 mins more listening to your concerns. We took our 6year old for cold and cough, after that we wanted to discuss about other concerns we had related to some skin allergies. Doctor got irritated and told you should explain everything one shot, I can't spare time checking him again and again. I have other patients to see. Later he checked and said it is nothing we are done. My son was still sitting on the bed he said get him down, take your file and leave. ******** ********* I wouldn't recommend him to anyone. I had a huge respect for cloudnine and the way they handle kids. We were in shock to see how unfriendly this doctor was.
