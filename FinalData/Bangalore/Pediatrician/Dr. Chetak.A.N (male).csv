Specific Experience 
My newborn had a mild jaundice when he was born. This continued for long and several people suggested me to get medication for him. We consulted Dr. Chetak that time and he brought us into confidence that no medication is required. Worried at the first place since others were constantly pointing to yellow color on my baby's face, But ultimately he became alright in a month or so. In nutshell,  he evaluates the problem carefully and sympathetically. Hope this helps practice readers and followers.
