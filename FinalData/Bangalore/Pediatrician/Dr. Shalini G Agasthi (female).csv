,"Paediatric care,",0,0,NO,Booked a slot. No proper response from reception staff about appointment asked wait. On asking again they mentioned doctor is in traffic. After an hour only we could meet doctor. Childs situation worsened after that and the visit didn't help. Charged Covid administration fee though they don't anything at all additionally for that. ,2022-06-12 23:29:10,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
