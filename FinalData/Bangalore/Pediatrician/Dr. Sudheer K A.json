Very Happy to share that our baby is now weighing 2 kgs. Have visited many countries and consulted doctors. Felt very surprised to see all international standard  techniques used by him as part of his treatment methodology. He gives very good attention and proactive. During our visits, we have also seen many cases of premature babies, babies with low birth weight, babies with severe infections are being treated successfully by doctor. Would highly recommend this doctor for babies and kids.",
