We hope that your baby has recovered. We have looked into your record and it looks like you had brought the baby for loose stools at the end of February, then you had come with history of baby being warm and then last week you had brought the baby for cough and fever. Everytime when the temperature was checked in the clinic it was low grade or there was no fever. If you had mentioned that he had high fever for one week, we would have definitely evaluated further. The reason we waited was because he  had low grade fever and mild respiratory symptoms and he was active and you didn't have to give paracetamol to control fever , if I remember right. Moreover, if any concern goes on for more than a week we always evaluate with lab tests as needed and in your case also we would have done the same. We don't misuse resources or don't make patients spend unnecessarily by doing tests early on when there is no indication. It's a reasonable choice to wait and observe for a week when there is low grade fever or minimal clinical symptoms.

If you don't trust us you are welcome to go elsewhere. But, please remember you are NOT  qualified to comment on the ability of the doctor when you don't have the clinical expertise. ",2019-03-16T10:24:39+0000,Dr. Anjana Hulse
