My 9year old daughter has visited other doctors multiple times for cough, cold, fever & other ailments. But it was Dr Gururaj Biradar who identified that my daughter having thyroid in her throat..a condition called lingual thyroid. I was so stressed.\nDr Guru sir took active approach & asked us to do few blood tests & thyroid scan. He also referred us to pediatric surgeon. Fortunately with God's grace, no surgery was required \n         Dr sir started my daughter on thyroid tablets as her thyroid levels were low. My daughter is absolutely fine now. Dr Gururaj is truly God sent. Never met such a friendly & professional doctor..",

Symptoms are life cold fever and cuff, and I also had a blood test done where the CRP % was little Hight this was my issue then soon after I visit Dr Gururaj Biradar, he told we need a admission and need to admit for 4 to 5 days then it will be fine. Then he gave me admission form and he called somebody from emergency department and suggested few blood tests worth of 15k but none of the reports are +ve and the issue what he supposed to check (CRP %) he didn\u2019t perform only. And finally, he started the treatment for pneumonia, *** **** ** *** ***** ******* **** ********** \nBut very next day morning only my kid is not even talking to me and saw that he started swelling mostly on the face and neck region and when I try to feed him forcibly but my kid said, mom I am unable to swallow anything and my neck is paining a lot then I try to touch his neck and observed large swelling around the neck and I immediately called the doctor and trying to explain my problem but no body was listening my words * **** ******** ******* ** **** **** *********** ***** *** doctor is not willing to listen at all and finally someone suggested to do the neck ultrasound but nothing was observed and I was speechless I have no solution and no one willing to looking at my kid but I was finally hoping on god to save my kid . because I lost all hops with this Gururaj. and finally, I was checking with Nurse. The nurse said that doctor suggested to change medicine so after 20 hrs. of the issue report the nurse started with new antibiotics and with that, I observed the swelling reducing ** **** **** *** ****** ** *** ***** ** ***** *** ******* ** ************* ********* ** **** ** *** ***** ******* ********* ******  anyways the treatment continued for only swelling around the next for 4 days nothings else was done.

Symptoms are life cold fever and cuff, and I also had a blood test done where the CRP % was little Hight this was my issue then soon after I visit Dr Gururaj Biradar, he told we need a admission and need to admit for 4 to 5 days then it will be fine. Then he gave me admission form and he called somebody from emergency department and suggested few blood tests worth of 15k but none of the reports are +ve and the issue what he supposed to check (CRP %) he didn\u2019t perform only. And finally, he started the treatment for pneumonia, *** **** ** *** ***** ******* **** ********** \nBut very next day morning only my kid is not even talking to me and saw that he started swelling mostly on the face and neck region and when I try to feed him forcibly but my kid said, mom I am unable to swallow anything and my neck is paining a lot then I try to touch his neck and observed large swelling around the neck and I immediately called the doctor and trying to explain my problem but no body was listening my words * **** ******** ******* ** **** **** *********** ***** *** doctor is not willing to listen at all and finally someone suggested to do the neck ultrasound but nothing was observed and I was speechless I have no solution and no one willing to looking at my kid but I was finally hoping on god to save my kid . because I lost all hops with this Gururaj. and finally, I was checking with Nurse. The nurse said that doctor suggested to change medicine so after 20 hrs. of the issue report the nurse started with new antibiotics and with that, I observed the swelling reducing ** **** **** *** ****** ** *** ***** ** ***** *** ******* ** ************* ********* ** **** ** *** ***** ******* ********* ******  anyways the treatment continued for only swelling around the next for 4 days nothings else was done.
