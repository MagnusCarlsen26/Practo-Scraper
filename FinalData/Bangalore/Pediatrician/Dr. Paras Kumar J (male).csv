None,"Children's Health,",0,0,YES,"Previously I had visited this doctor and provided a low rating as the doctor suggested to examine my baby only with the medical file. I was bit disappointed as I had come from a far distance just to meet this doctor. 
This time met the doctor with all the required files and the doctor attended my baby with really good care and later explained me about the necessity of the medical file as why itâ€™s important. Now  I feel that I took a hasty decision in providing a low rating because thinking from the doctors perspective he was right as the medical file is really important. 
5 stars to the doctor. ",2024-04-10 12:59:52,False,True,Bhavya,,,
