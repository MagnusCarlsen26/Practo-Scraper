His mother told several time about this and doctor after examining his chest give Sinarest AF. Always assure about my baby that she is a smaller weight - everything is OK. But as cold and cough is not reducing we went (just after his visit) to another doctor who gave some blood test to the child by seeing his development and D3 deficiency was enormous. The new specialist with his equipment found child has suffering from ear infection gave antibiotic and advice Tympanometry after 2 month. After doing the test we found even after the medicine the ear infection is still there. Even the new ped found issue in teeth.

Since first 3 month after his birth we used to go to him in Rainbow Marathalli and our child is little bit on thinner side. He suffered from cold and cough frequently. His mother told several time about this and doctor after examining his chest give Sinarest AF. Always assure about my baby that she is a smaller weight - everything is OK. But as cold and cough is not reducing we went (just after his visit) to another doctor who gave some blood test to the child by seeing his development and D3 deficiency was enormous. The new specialist with his equipment found child has suffering from ear infection gave antibiotic and advice Tympanometry after 2 month. After doing the test we found even after the medicine the ear infection is still there. Even the new ped found issue in teeth. We are scared if my wife didn't insist and we put our child under this doctor!",
