She cried all night and we had to rush to the emergency at 12.30am because we weren’t told what to expect.

But what made me really angry was when I asked what I can do to pacify my baby because our baby was crying non stop, this were his exact words : “what’s the extreme that can happen, she’ll cry, maybe turn blue, maybe go unconscious for a while and wake up again”.

1. Firstly, he picked up his call and was busy on it while we were in his chamber and were discussing on my concerns. The doctor made us wait and my baby was crying while he was busy on his call for more than 10 mints. He didn't even apologise which is very unprofessional.
2. When I told my concerns, he was least interested and did not have patience to listen completely. He behaved very rudely and somehow wanted to finish and get away. Due to his behavior I could not ask much of questions which I had. The consultation charges for 550 rs and he did not even spent 5 minutes. 
3. I went 2 times for consultation and both the times he was in a hurry. He does not sit and explain anything properly. I am not going to him again and already consulting a different doctor.",2020-01-08 17:05:48,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
