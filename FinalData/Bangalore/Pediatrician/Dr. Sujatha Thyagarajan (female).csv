"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Paediatric Intensive Care,",0,0,NO,"We had very bad experience with this doctor in Rainbow hospital. Child was admitted with high fever and stomach problems. Doctor was very rude  and not ready to listen to parents opinions. They did all the tests including CT, Meningitis and encephalitis and everything came negative and final conclusion is it can be due to food poisoning.  Same thing when we told at beginning,they were not ready to listen. Never recommend hospital or doctor",2018-06-15 06:34:10,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
