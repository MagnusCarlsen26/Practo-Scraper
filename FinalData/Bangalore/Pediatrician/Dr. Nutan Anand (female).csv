- Lacks human touch and friendliness
- Does not look interested to really connect with the patient and assure them
- Does not really explain the details. She isnt bothered if you are convinced or your concerns are put to rest. 
- We also had to get vaccination done for my baby during covid-19, But as per the process we were asked to do video consultation with the doctor. And then doctor says she is not available for vaccination. This could have been informed to us by staff before fixing appointment or atleast the doc could have handled this better by forwarding us to another doctor who was available in same hospital.

- Overall, not worth the high fee we pay at the hospital. Doctors at clinics give  us much much better experience than this.

Appreciate you taking out time to provide feedback.

I give my 100% to ensure all babies receive the best of treatment possible. My patients return back to me for my approach towards treatment of their kids and I leave no stone unturned if that means doing the right tests for their wards as a measure of precaution. Genetic disorder test is an important test (minor investment for kids well-being).

I had advised you to visit the hospital for any emergency beyond the OPD hours, Motherhood is equipped with skilled Doctors to take care of any emergencies round the clock. I can assure you, every kid that comes to me will get the best of treatment in my capacity however choosing a doctor is one’s choice and I leave that to you.
