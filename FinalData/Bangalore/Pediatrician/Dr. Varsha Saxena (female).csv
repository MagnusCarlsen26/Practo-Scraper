My life and health are worth every penny.I am happy that that she is young, and will not be retiring on me any time soon.Like everyone else here, I cannot say enough about Dr Varsha and about this practice.

We found her when we were searching for a pediatrician for our baby. Waited in crowds of people in many cold waiting rooms. Met many overworked late tired doctors.  Until we met Dr Varhsa.

The practice is intentionally small and so warm and caring. Dr Swan spends a long time with you -- and you feel like you're the only thing in her day at that moment. We loved her manner and experience and caring with our requirement.

Dr. Varsha is the best, most attentive, caring, whole-person treating doctor I've ever had. She's got an unusual mix of being a top-educated doctor plus a kind, empathetic human being. I have never felt so well taken care of.

The best feeling is going there and knowing she's treating your whole being -- if I have one ailment somewhere, she still checks in on progress with other issues, and by the end of the 30 or 45 minutes, I feel so well attended to!

I would not hesitate to recommend anyone to Dr Swan and to this practice.
