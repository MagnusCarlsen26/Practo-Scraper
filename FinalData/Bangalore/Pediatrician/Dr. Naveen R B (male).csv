I switched to Dr. Naveen following lukewarm response from Manipal Paediatrician while seeking treatment for both my daughters, aged 12 and 4, respectively. Dr. Naveen was very kind and patient with the younger child. His treatment was thorough, yet conservative. He does not dispense antibiotic without real need. Moreover, he takes time to educate the child's parent on his/her condition, as well as treatment provided. He even follows up with the patients family to ensure he is aware of the progress/outcome of the treatment. This aspect is very humane and indeed, very comforting for the ailing child's family. 

Really recommend Dr. Naveen as paediatrician to all who is reading this!

CloudNine should take care of these things *** *** ***** ***** ********** *** ** **** ********",2020-08-24 11:27:19,False,False,Sheetal Dixit,"Dear Sheetal Dixit,
Thank you for ur concern.
First The Whole World is in Corona pandemic, According to the hospital rules only One Attender is allowed inside the hospital. Attenders should wear proper mask and maintain social distancing. For both Safety of the Patients and the Hospital staff also.
My OPD timings was over & I had removed my PPE kit, the management told a walk in patient want to consult for the Vaccination.
But I still took the risk and did the consultation by wearing Facemask and Faceshield and Double glows.
Since the Lockdown has started we are allowing Only One Attender to enter inside the OPD for Safety measures.
But u started having Argument that I also want to enter the OPD along with the mother and baby to overcrowd the OPD [ 10 by 10 feet OPD room ]. As in the previous consultation other doctor had allowed to do so.
If other doctor don't follow safety measures it's risking the Doctor, Urself, Baby & Nursing Staff attending to the patient .
You were not wearing a proper mask as well which Covers both ur Nose and Mouth ( Spong mask which u were wearing is of 0% protection for Corona virus ), Ur Nose was Protruding Outside Inhaling & Exhaling the air outside Risking Urself and Hospital staff also.( As Corona is Airborne especially in closed Air-conditioned environment ) WHO World Health Organization has declared it. 
Virus can transmit upto 8 feet & keep suspended in air for many hours.
Coming to the consultation inside the OPD room. Red tape line is put on the Floor & Sticker ( One Person Only allowed Inside ) Legibly and Pictorial Foot Image also ( Any Layman can also Understand it ). 
And my OPD doors are always kept open for Proper Air Circulation. ( Since lockdown we are following the protocols in my OPD room ).
Inspite of it u were crossing the safety line and trying to touch the table risking Urself & Hospital staff for the Corona infection by Not Maintaining Social distancing.
Your baby was Preterm Born with weight of 2.03 kg but ur baby was not put on Proper Supplements, I advised u to start the Supplements and explained the mother regarding the proper growth and development. I don't know what was the reason the Supplements was not started for ur baby in the previous consultations. ( Please read the prescription )
Mother asked can she feed in Nipple bottle, I advised Nipple bottles should never be used to any baby at any point of life, use only spoon or pallada only. ( Standard Pediatric protocol ) 
These all discussions I had with the mother after the Vaccination.
You were upset ( father ) for not allowing you inside the OPD. ( Reason is to Avoid over crowding inside the 10 by 10 OPD room ) 
Next time when u visit any doctor please Wear Proper Mask and Maintain Social Distancing. It's my Sincere Advice as a doctor. Corona will not spare any one. Till now many doctors have succumbed for Corona for not taking Safety Measures. 
Till we get Vaccination & Proper Treatment Protocol. We should follow all safety measures. 
As a Responsible Citizen please follow Safety measures from now on atleast and educate others also.
Please start the Supplements as prescribed as your preterm babies require it for proper Growth and Development of Brain & Body it's already delayed. 80% myelination of brain happens in first 12 months( 1st year ), 15% myelination happens in 2nd year of life, rest 5% happens later. ( Supplements are prescribed according to standard Pediatric protocols )
All discussions in hospital was not arrogance it's for patients safety ( ie Your safety ).
I have followed all safety measures since lockdown has started & will continue to do till we come out from the CORONA Pandemic.
Hope you will also follow it in future hospital visits.
Hope I have answered ur concerns Sheetal Dixit.
At last Please consider Doctors as Human beings they also have there old aged parents & near dear once waiting at home, they risk their life and treat the society even in Pandemic.
I haven't taken a single day leave since the pandemic has started, done my duty sincerely.
Hope this reply will be helpful & educating many in the society.
Stay safe & Stay healthy for Healthy Society.

Thank you.
