Dr. Sreenath is a terrific Doctor and an awesome human being. At times the word ‚ÄòThank you‚Äô seem so little to express your gratitude. Through this note I just want to convey my words of thankfulness to him. 

My wife had delivered our Son at Fortis LaFemme under Dr. Pratima Reddy and it was there we came across Dr. Sreenath who heads the Pediatrics department there. 

All was well for the first 15 days for my baby until the 16th day when he got high grade fever ranging up to 104.2F. He was not taking his Mother‚Äôs milk and continuously crying incessantly. Utterly concerned with the unusual fever at this stage, we rushed to the hospital where he was delivered to find Dr. Shalini. 

Understanding the gravity of situation she recommended to admit my infant in NICU immediately. She contacted Dr. Sreenath and made him aware of the situation. He was given  paracetamol to bring down the temperature but there was no relief whatsoever. He continued to make painful sounds. 

Doctor Sreenath diagnosed my baby the next day Morning and suggested a series of medical tests including the CRP, PCT and others. The initial reports suggested late onset of sepsis which is nothing but the bacterial infection.  He recommended antibiotics with the likes of amic acid and peptas which helped in his treatment to a great deal. Later to understand the root cause he suggested Molecular DNA test to understand the presence of micro-organisms and treat with the right medicine. Dr. Sreenath prescribed complete 15 day anti-biotic treatment so that  the infection does not haunt back in my neonate. 

I vividly recall in his first counselling he explained the situation being empathetic truly sensing our concern. I cherish his words that he treats every children like his own and give his best. He even consoled my wife uttering in hindi, our mother tongue, though not his. I was amazed with his compassion and passion towards his job. 

What amazed me was his accuse sense of personal responsibility. ** ** ************* ******* listens to the patients/guardians well and does best to provide the right treatment with a phased approach ensuring the problem is treated from root level and not just the surface. Dr. Sreenath is a Go-To Doctor when it comes to your pediatric needs. 

Thank you and God bless.

"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,Doctor friendliness,","Paediatric Critical Care,",0,0,YES,"My baby was 15 days old and he had passed blood in stool. This is due to providing formula feed (Similac advanced) along with my feed (as my feed was  insufficient). We immediately consulted the doctor and he changed the formula feed to Nutramigen. The blood in the stool has stopped but however I observed that he had discomfort in digestion and he started to mourn, when I took him to doctor I understood that he is not only intolerant to lactose but also to cow's milk protein.  We did the required tests and the result was positive. Doctor switched to Neocate from Nutramigen and the baby is fine with this feed. Simultaneously I had to stop consuming milk and curds as the baby is not able to digest. This has resolved the feed issue.

Also due to my hormonal changes he had neonatal acne and the doctor suggested Atogla and Ritch lotion to subside the itchiness and red rashes that had occured on his face. I could see the results in a day's time and my baby stopped crying

I wish I had a magic wand to clear away behavioural problems in 15 minutes , which child psychologists take 5-10 sessions to deal with !!!My appointment slots are for 15 minutes only so that I can see all my waiting patients. 

I do conduct parental workshops voluntarily to educate parents regarding positive parenting. That‚Äôs the service I do voluntarily to help children have better parenting at home. I screen Children for any behavioural problems and refer to the right people if they need any help. Parenting and behavioural issues need longer one to one sessions of 60-90 minutes to sort out the issues. 

As a pediatrician my job is to identify any red flag signs and decide which therapist to refer depending on my assessment of the child and family. I remember that I spent at least 30 minutes with you and your child, despite 4 patients waiting outside to see me. I‚Äôve Assessed your child‚Äôs development and ruled out red flag signs which need immediate attention. After having ruled out major psychological illnesses, I reassured you and gave some tips on positive parenting and how to work on his behaviour. I referred you to a specialist who can help you further. These issues take some time to work on and need one to one sessions with the child. I suggest you to find by yourself a good child psychologist & behavioural therapist and take few one to one sessions to work on your child.

"Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,NO,,2023-02-07 17:05:15,False,False,Saravana Kumar T,"Thank you for your feedback. Sorry for your experience. I very rarely prescribe antibiotics and your son presented with a massive lymph node swelling in the neck which needed antibiotics. I generally prescribe very less investigations , however your child case was different. Whenever child presents with such a massive swelling it‚Äôs always prudent to investigate to find out the cause. Simply giving antibiotics without any tests can sometimes mask underlying disease such as TB or Malignancy. Hence I recommended the tests, which are standard protocol in any good hospital. Also majority of kids who present with such massive swelling may not respond to oral antibiotics, which is a fact.",2023-05-08T14:25:47+0000,Dr. Sreenath S Manikanti
