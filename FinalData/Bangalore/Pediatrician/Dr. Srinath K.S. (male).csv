None,None,0,0,YES,"This is our first time ever with Cloud nine hospital and it's doctor.

Having recently moved to Bangalore, we have very little knowledge about whereabouts in this new city. We desperately needed to find a paediatrician for my baby in a span of two weeks as his immunization was due this week. We were referred to Dr. Srinath by my husband's aunt's family who live in the same area where the hospital is located.

Upon entering the doctor's chamber, he greeted us with a great smile. The doctor made us feel comfortable and asked us if we had any concerns regarding the baby. He made sure that when we left we had nothing more to ask of him.

We are happy with the services provided by him. ",2017-04-16 17:15:16,False,True,Mrs.Trupti,,,
