,,0,0,YES,First of all i am very much thankful to almighty God for providing such a humble and nice doctor for the treatment of my son. His explanation about the decease and the line of treatment is very clear and satisfactory. Professionalism to the core and sangfroid nature is something I admire him the most. *** ** *** **** ********** ******* ** *** ********    ,2020-08-22 06:38:28,False,True,Mohammad,,,
