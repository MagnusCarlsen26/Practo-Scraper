I was very pleased by Dr Suneela\u2018a professional , polite and precise approach  and she was patient and  wonderful to my 11 year old daughter . My daughter was very very anxious to have skin prick allergy test but Dr Suneela was very quick to build rapport with her and explained the procedure so well to my daughter such that it allayed her anxiety completely. \n\nMyself being a doctor in UK and having lived there for 15 years I must say Dr Suneela was excellent and comparable to any , in fact better than specialist doctors in UK . Thank you Dr Suneela",
