We have been going to Hopeberry Clinic for about 7 months now with Dr. Arjun as a primary doctor for our daughter. Dr. Arjun is extremely diligent and thorough when it comes to Pediatrics. He is very patient and at the same time very friendly who genuinely cares about his patients. He clearly explains things to us in terms that we can understand. We have always felt very confident in his care. He is also available for phone calls & WhatsApp in case of emergency which is very much necessary when we have become parents for the 1st time. The staff always follow up with us and call to remind us about our appointments. I do recommend Dr. Arjun if anyone is looking for a good Pediatrician.
