Her treatment helped our son to recover from rare bacteria is less than 3 days. She is one such person who never forced us to be in hospital unlike many other doctors.

After listening to the fever pattern and looking at kid's current state, she suggested to continue with the home medication and observe for next 2 days. She comforted us by suggesting to take similar approach in future and not worry if there are no major signs of illness apart from fever. She is the first doctor I ve ever consulted who suggested that such viral fevers do not even need her involvement and usually go on their own. I liked her methodical approach, patience in listening to the problem *** ******** ********** ****** ********** ********** My kid was also very comfortable with her and kept engaged in toys she gave him.

She is available over on phone for any emergency or clarification. We really impressed with her patience and good care of Kid and it was necessary to take blood test for my kid and she came by herself to blood test room and gave confidence to my kid and took care of his fear. \nWith all her good care and treatment he is doing well. Highly recommended doctor for Kids. Thank you !! \ud83d\ude4f",

She comforted us by suggesting to take similar approach in future and not worry if there are no major signs of illness apart from fever. She is the first doctor I ve ever consulted who suggested that such viral fevers do not even need her involvement and usually go on their own.

She took the time to listen to our daughter\u2019s concerns and answered all of our questions in detail, making sure we understood everything. What impressed us the most about Dr. Shilpa was her caring and compassionate approach towards our daughter. She was patient and gentle with her, making sure she felt comfortable and at ease not just during her vaccinations but also when she was suffering with flu. She took the time to explain things in a way that our 2.5 year old daughter could understand, which helped to alleviate her fears and anxieties. Overall, we cannot recommend Dr. Shilpa Pandya highly enough. She is an outstanding pediatrician who goes above and beyond for her patients. If you are looking for a compassionate, *************, and caring pediatrician for your child, then look no further than Dr. Shilpa. ",
