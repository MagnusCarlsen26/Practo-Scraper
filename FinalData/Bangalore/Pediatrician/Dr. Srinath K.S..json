We were referred to Dr. Srinath by my husband's aunt's family who live in the same area where the hospital is located.\n\nUpon entering the doctor's chamber, he greeted us with a great smile. The doctor made us feel comfortable and asked us if we had any concerns regarding the baby. He made sure that when we left we had nothing more to ask of him.\n\nWe are happy with the services provided by him. ",

We were referred to Dr. Srinath by my husband's aunt's family who live in the same area where the hospital is located.\n\nUpon entering the doctor's chamber, he greeted us with a great smile. The doctor made us feel comfortable and asked us if we had any concerns regarding the baby. He made sure that when we left we had nothing more to ask of him.\n\nWe are happy with the services provided by him. ",
