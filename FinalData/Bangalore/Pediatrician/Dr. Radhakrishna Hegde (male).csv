None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Hegde has a way around with the little ones. He seems to wear a combination of hats for both his wards and those who come along with them. He's a doctor, a consultant, a confidant, a friend, a magician with the syringe (hardly seen my grandson cry after he has been picked), a well wisher (prescribes medicines on SOS basis & doesn't recommend unnecessary tests) and an expert trusted advisor! My appreciations to him for being there for my grandson anytime he's needed him, for making the most appropriate recommendation (as if my grandson were his son) and more importantly for being attentive to the real needs of my grandchild. Thank you!",2020-02-11 06:10:44,False,True,Shridhar Bhandary,,,
