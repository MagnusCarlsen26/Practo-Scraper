None,None,0,0,NO,"He recommended Dolopar-250 worth 43 rs and said he is having only viral...but u bring ur son after 3-4 days..And my son was not having fever on the 4rd day only weakness was their...So I went to Apollo  thought Dr Akram asked me to come.
On 4 th day Dr Akram given list of test 
1- Complete blood count
2- Dengue Profile
3- Malarial Antigen Rapid (Card)
4- C Reactive Protein
5- Typhit Dot

total cost of test =3,000.
And all the test were Nagative. 

Only for sake of money he has given these test...and one more important thing that he asked to have these test not from Apollo clinic,But from ""add-onScans &Labs""..

Is this right way of earning money by Doctor's ?

Please tell where we should go where we can have genuine treatment ...

He called us immediately to clinic and expressed his inability to handle the case and asked to admit my son to Sakra.

"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"Over subscription of antibiotics. Took my kid for a cold and ear pain. Told him clearly that he has no ear pain now, just want to confirm that he has no infection.
Immediately without even examination he said I will put him on antibiotics.
And suggested to take it from the pharmacy he suggested.

Went for a second opinion with another doctor, found that there was no infection at all. Ear pain was just side effect of cold and is very common in kids.
