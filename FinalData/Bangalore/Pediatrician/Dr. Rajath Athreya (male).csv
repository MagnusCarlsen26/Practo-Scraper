"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,I had been seeing Dr. Rajath for my daughter. She contracted severe cold at just one month of age. He prescribed medicines and did not push for hospital admission. He is very gentle and I am surprised to read reviews stating that he is not approachable. Some cases require hospitalization since immunity of babies and adults are different. So it's not fair to say that Dr. is unnecessarily pushing for hospitalization. In fact in our case the cold was so severe we thought hospitalization might be necessary. But Dr. Rajath assured us that it will not be needed and prescribed some medicines which cured our daughter eventually. ,2020-01-08 08:23:03,False,True,Rony,,,
