She is quite friendly with kids and our child soon felt very comfortable with her and started expressing her problems. Later she checked the child completely . She very clearly explained to us as what could be the possible reasons for the problems. We did few tests which were suggested . Again very clearly explained the reasoning for doing the test. We did MRI Brain at Hospital .Medicines were started . A detailed description of medicines and possible side effects were mentioned too.

We would like to express our Gratitude and are Highly Thankful to have met Dr Usha Mallinath . our child was in a critical situation and upon visiting  two  hospitals in Kolar we were told that child is critical and would need a specialist Pediatric Neurologist care . We immediately got our son to Manipal Hospital . Our child was not in his senses , disoriented and had significant headache . He was admitted at Pediatric Intensive care under Dr Usha Mallinath. All relevant investigations were done and treatment was started soon . we were regularly updated about reports , clinical  condition of child and treatment .

Dr Usha is such a wonderful Doctor . She is so professional and practical . She used to examine the child completely daily and make changes as needed. we were updated daily on child progress and treatment plan . Our child started recognizing us in 2 days and soon headache resolved and all other problems too. Unfortunately he had  severe Brain infection .She made a diagnosis in 2 days and all appropriate medications were commenced on timely basis . No tests were done without informing us and she would explain to us the need for test and possible side effects too. She is very clear and transparent  in her  explanation . She gives clear picture of problem .Overall Excellent care provided by the doctor .

This enables faster analysis and early detection and cure.
On a lighter note , my kid enjoys the cafetaria canteen Dosa's and the Dr always mentions that he could be one of the few who would like so!
