We are Extremely happy and grateful to  her for taking care of our Daughter 

our child was noticed to have certain movements and difficulty in walking . We had consulted quite a few doctors prior to visiting her . She was referred by our Pediatrician . We immediately booked an appointment and visited her . First impression itself was very pleasant.  she is highly profession and very composed person. She made us feel very comfortable. Doctor is highly respectful for her patients . She very clearly listened to us and went through all the tests which were done . She spoke to the child and child was also allowed to express herself. We were really amazed with her approach . Very rarely we had seen doctors being so Methodical. She is quite friendly with kids and our child soon felt very comfortable with her and started expressing her problems. Later she checked the child completely . She very clearly explained to us as what could be the possible reasons for the problems. We did few tests which were suggested . Again very clearly explained the reasoning for doing the test. We did MRI Brain at Hospital .Medicines were started . A detailed description of medicines and possible side effects were mentioned too. 

She is very transparent and clear in her approach. Doesnt promise false outcomes and results . Medicines were started . We are also getting regular Physiotherapy at Hospital as suggested by Doctor .We have come for regular follow ups . Our child slowly has shown tremendous improvement. Every visit she speaks to the child as well to know the progress and issues. Slowly all the problems were taken care off and child is able to walk well now with no abnormal movements .Medicines have been slowly taken off and stopped now. Our child is back to what she was before .
We were very worried about our child but the way Dr Usha has managed her is highly commendable . Our Daughter will be looking forward to meet her . Feels very happy to see such doctors who are Highly Professional , Young  and friendly . She is an Inspiration to kids . Our daughter says she would want to be like her .

We would like to express our Gratitude and are Highly Thankful to have met Dr Usha Mallinath . our child was in a critical situation and upon visiting  two  hospitals in Kolar we were told that child is critical and would need a specialist Pediatric Neurologist care . We immediately got our son to Manipal Hospital . Our child was not in his senses , disoriented and had significant headache . He was admitted at Pediatric Intensive care under Dr Usha Mallinath. All relevant investigations were done and treatment was started soon . we were regularly updated about reports , clinical  condition of child and treatment .

Dr Usha is such a wonderful Doctor . She is so professional and practical . She used to examine the child completely daily and make changes as needed. we were updated daily on child progress and treatment plan . Our child started recognizing us in 2 days and soon headache resolved and all other problems too. Unfortunately he had  severe Brain infection .She made a diagnosis in 2 days and all appropriate medications were commenced on timely basis . No tests were done without informing us and she would explain to us the need for test and possible side effects too. She is very clear and transparent  in her  explanation . She gives clear picture of problem .Overall Excellent care provided by the doctor .

She is so good with kids , our child started talking to her next day and would express what he is going through . She is an inspiration and Role model for Kids .

Excellent care provided by the doctor ,Dr Usha Mallinath . we visited her from Andhra Pradesh as suggested by our friend . Both of our kids had issues with seizures and behaviour and they were on lot of medicines  which were not helping . we are very fortunate to have met the doctor. She looked into issues completly and advised to wean off medicines . As per the advice , we weaned of medicines and both our kids are doing very well now . They are competly off all medications without any problems . we are following all other advice suggested by her .
Its very easy for doctors to prescribe lot of medicines but the doctor who understands the problem , makes parents understands the same and doesnt prescribe lot of medicines is Great and is really concerned  about the well being of the  child . She is truly our Hero .
we are very satisfied that we came all the way for Andhra Pradesh and got this wonderful care form her . Its a blessing to see such well educated and  experienced doctor who cares for well being of children .

Clearly explained the problem and advised medication to be followed. 
The way the issue was approached with clear and logical steps is really commendable. Every time the Dr sees my child, she makes him feel very comfortable speaking with him while performing the physical examination. This way both us and kids feel very reverential towards her. My kid is doing absolutely fine today. I urge all parents to not to wait for any such events and without delay a specialist has to be contacted rather than a General Paed. This enables faster analysis and early detection and cure.
On a lighter note , my kid enjoys the cafetaria canteen Dosa's and the Dr always mentions that he could be one of the few who would like so! This atttitude brings Usha (light rays) in many peoples lives and we sincerely thank the Dr from the bottom of our heart. May the light of Jupiter shine on her and entire family and may she bring light to many many more peoples lives.
