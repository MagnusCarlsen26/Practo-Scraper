Since  that day she is the only Pediatrician we are seeing till now. We visit for vaccinations and periodic viral infections that she suffers  from. Each time we see her she listens to the problem carefully and does right diagnosis of the condition and prescribes appropriate medicine. She starts with mild medication in the beginning and waits for the child to respond to it and then move on to antibiotics only if necessary. This is what we like most in her and also she doesn\u2019t scare parents by advising to do lots of tests and reports. Overall she is ver reliable  and efficient doctor that one can look for.",

Parents who come for vaccination normally know that it is temporary painful experience for baby and they do understand that it is actually for their baby's benefit in long run to protect against many serious infections. As doctors , we try to do best to out little patients. We try to explain about vaccines and possible side effects, how to deal with them and at same time ,see if baby is growing appropriate for age. We try to answer to your queries and clarify parents doubts. We are more than ready for that.. ...But people need to ask if something is bothering them. If you think about discussing something, then discuss. Ask.. Doctor can not read your mind. \nAlso, oral vaccine which is provided by company in a vial has to be given that ways as it is sterile. \nBest wishes !",

Vaccine were discussed prior to giving. It is surprising & worrying  to see you having no respect for doctors who are doing their best in Covid pandemic ,even putting their own life at risk !!  Anyways.....Any vaccine(even \"painless \") has potential to cause problems in the area they are  given. Vaccine side effects are universal & are not created by doctors. In such situations,we appreciate if the patient reverts back( visit/call/ msg) so that we can help. ...Lastly, my knowledge & experience gives me confidence to say-\"Its normal\". Many newborn issues like colic, reflux settle as baby grows with minimal medication ,which was discussed with you... Hope you get it.",

Doctor never explained to me what vaccines are being given. Nurse told me doctor would do and doctor never bothered to do before giving them. As a parent its my right to know what is being administered and its impact.I know its written in a booklet but you shoudl still explain.2. Doctor never took time to comfort the baby before doing vaccinations. I have another daughter who was vaccinated by 4 different doctors during her time, *** **** *** ** **** * ****** She came and just Did her job as if she was being forced to do it.3. I opted for a painless vaccination and the result is after a day i see start of infection on both her legs. I consulted another doctor who is of similar experience. * ***** **** *** **** *** ** **** ** ***** ****** *** **** *** ** **** ***** ** **** ********* This was not at all done with care.** *** ***** ******** ** **** ** ** **** ******** ** ******* ************ I risked taking my baby to hospital mainly for consulation and she didnt even care.

She pays close attention on the concerns and then provides a step by step consultation which is easier to follow. She also engages well with kids which helped us in having hassle free vaccinations. From hereon we will have only \"online consultation\" available  with us as we are relocating out of India, but this is to all who are looking out for a great pediatrician on whom you can trust for nothing less than an excellent care. \n\nThank you, Doctor - From Avni!

Since  that day she is the only Pediatrician we are seeing till now. We visit for vaccinations and periodic viral infections that she suffers  from. Each time we see her she listens to the problem carefully and does right diagnosis of the condition and prescribes appropriate medicine. She starts with mild medication in the beginning and waits for the child to respond to it and then move on to antibiotics only if necessary. This is what we like most in her and also she doesn\u2019t scare parents by advising to do lots of tests and reports. Overall she is ver reliable  and efficient doctor that one can look for.",

Vaccine were discussed prior to giving. It is surprising & worrying  to see you having no respect for doctors who are doing their best in Covid pandemic ,even putting their own life at risk !!  Anyways.....Any vaccine(even \"painless \") has potential to cause problems in the area they are  given. Vaccine side effects are universal & are not created by doctors. In such situations,we appreciate if the patient reverts back( visit/call/ msg) so that we can help. ...Lastly, my knowledge & experience gives me confidence to say-\"Its normal\". Many newborn issues like colic, reflux settle as baby grows with minimal medication ,which was discussed with you... Hope you get it.",

What really broke my experience was when i visited her at Sarjapur motherhood for vaccination and consulation of my month old baby.Couple of problems1. Doctor never explained to me what vaccines are being given. Nurse told me doctor would do and doctor never bothered to do before giving them. As a parent its my right to know what is being administered and its impact.I know its written in a booklet but you shoudl still explain.2. Doctor never took time to comfort the baby before doing vaccinations. I have another daughter who was vaccinated by 4 different doctors during her time, *** **** *** ** **** * ****** She came and just Did her job as if she was being forced to do it.3. I opted for a painless vaccination and the result is after a day i see start of infection on both her legs. I consulted another doctor who is of similar experience. * ***** **** *** **** *** ** **** ** ***** ****** *** **** *** ** **** ***** ** **** ********* This was not at all done with care.** *** ***** ******** ** **** ** ** **** ******** ** ******* ************ I risked taking my baby to hospital mainly for consulation and she didnt even care. All my questions are answered in 2 words \" Its normal\" . **** *** *** ***** ******* *** ********** ** ****** *** ***** ** ** **********I have already consulted some other doc and not going to come to her again. I hope things improve in future. I have no problema with Hospital though.",

From hereon we will have only \"online consultation\" available  with us as we are relocating out of India, but this is to all who are looking out for a great pediatrician on whom you can trust for nothing less than an excellent care. \n\nThank you, Doctor - From Avni!
