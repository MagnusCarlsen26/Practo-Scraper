"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,","Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,NO,Had visited her for vaccination last month. After paying the consultation charges vaccination wasn’t done because it could induce fever and my son has some exams coming up. She wrote some multivitamins and asked us to come for vaccination later and we need not pay the consultation charges again. When we went again after couple of weeks she asked us to pay the consultation charges once again as the last visit was for illness. When I pointed out that It was clearly written on the consultation sheet that we came for vaccination last time and multivitamins she wrote was something she did on her own. She behaved very rude with us. I felt very insulted. I would not advice anyone to visit her ** ****  ****** ***** ** ******* *** **********,2022-10-06 09:38:57,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
