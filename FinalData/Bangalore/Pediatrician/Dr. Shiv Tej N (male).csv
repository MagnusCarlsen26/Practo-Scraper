,,0,0,YES,"I had taken my 4year old daughter,as she was suffering from high grade fever with pain abdomen.. I had consulted other paediatrician they got multiple blood test.. evrything was normal .. then I found Dr shiv tej  on ovum website and consulted him.doctor was very polite and humble and he had so much patience to listen about my daughter illness.. he said since all blood test is done , I just want to get urine test done because he suspected my daughter might be having urinary tract infection and that was true. My daughter received a course of antibiotic and now she is doing well..
All thanks to this humble doctor. Strongly recommend him",2024-01-15 13:18:18,False,True,Shree,,,
