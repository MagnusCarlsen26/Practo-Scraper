My Experience Story:
Met Dr. for the first time during a checkup for a normal checkup. I know for sure today i have a baby only cause of Dr Chaitra. From the moment i conceived again possible only due to doctor and her treatment and encouragment. I had a hemorage a week afte knowing i conceived and Dr was very clear about the siutation and explained it to me very well no fear mongering neither did she sugar coat it but in a calm manner which in turn gave me the encouragemnt to face it. Advicing me on what to do and promptly giving me medical care .As the pregnancy progressed Dr was on mark with all checks and vaccinations and fetal monitoring. Coaching me to do the best and encourging me when i got dishartened .
Both Dr and us had planned for a normal delivery( starting me on squats and kegel exercise at the begenning of my thrist trimester) but by the end of my final trimest my BP started to shoot up and due to less fetal movement we had to rush in for a emergency C-Section. This was within 1-2 hrs and Dr was immediatly available and present . After the delivery and based on what happend in the OT ( and  lot of googling later ) I am 1000% sure that C-Section was the only solution and I am really glad i put blind fait in my Dr who has never advice anything wrong for me.
Dr Chaitra was the only doctor ( even pediatrics did not help) who asked how my son and liteally showed me what i was doing wrong with breastfeeding and how to latch properly. This is above and beyond what was expected and this shows how much the doctor cares about her patients .Since the others just told me to watch youtube videos.
I can never thank Dr Chaitra enough for all the suppport she has given me .
