Firstly she told me that my pregnancy was absolutely normal and I need no treatments. I had a normal delivery and very smooth pregnancy period also . Would never be able to thank her enough. So now, even for my silliest gynaecological problem, I visit only her. ***** *** ****",

Instead of Explaining what the issue was she just wrapped up and proceeded with the next patient saying I will explain in the next visit. Waiting for one hour, and got consulted for hardly five minutes. please do not go consult her. Myself  and my husband were very disappointed. ",

After such a long wait, the doctor was least bothered to explain the issue. She was in such  haste and no empathy at all. Please do not consult her. Instead of Explaining what the issue was she just wrapped up and proceeded with the next patient saying I will explain in the next visit. Waiting for one hour, and got consulted for hardly five minutes. please do not go consult her. Myself  and my husband were very disappointed. ",
