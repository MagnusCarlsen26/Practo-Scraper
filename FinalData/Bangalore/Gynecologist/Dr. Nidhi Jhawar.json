At first we consulted Dr. Jayashree Nagaraj, who recommended us to meet Dr. Nidhi as this will have a huge impact on my fertility related things and for her expertise in fertility related issues as well.\n\nDr. Nidhi was very sweet and welcoming, she explained to me throughly about the condition, entire medical procedure and post surgery recovery and all. She didn\u2019t just limit it to the specific procedure, instead genuinely looked at and took in to consideration about every way that it will affect my health, fertility in the future also. \n\nThrough the entire procedure, she constantly made sure that everything was going well, was available at anytime ready for any concerns even after I was  discharged from the hospital.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Nidhi for her expertise, kindness and also for being so supportive which is extremely important for a women going through such a phase",

She didn\u2019t just limit it to the specific procedure, instead genuinely looked at and took in to consideration about every way that it will affect my health, fertility in the future also. \n\nThrough the entire procedure, she constantly made sure that everything was going well, was available at anytime ready for any concerns even after I was  discharged from the hospital.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Nidhi for her expertise, kindness and also for being so supportive which is extremely important for a women going through such a phase",

She Truly deserves all appreciation and accolades . She is very experienced, calm, & friendly in nature. The best thing about her is how she focuses on patients. During the time she motivated my wife to stay active and eat healthy.she also goes in for minimal medication and testing &  believes that a natural process like pregnancy needs no intervention unless really required. she has been patient in answering questions. now suddenly i got transfer order from my job & we decided to shift new place . everything is all right but when I think about wife pregnancy treatment that time I really missed Dr Nidhi . we both Decided wherever we r moving we will go with Dr Nidhi advice. Would definitely recommend Her ! *** ** *** **** ************* * **** **** *",
