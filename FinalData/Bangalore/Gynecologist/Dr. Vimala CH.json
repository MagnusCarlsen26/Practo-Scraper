Her guidance was outstanding, helping to alleviate my fears and anxieties.\nShe recommended specific exercises to promote a normal delivery, which I followed diligently. I didn't need to join any additional yoga classes or other programs. I was able to deliver my baby naturally just by strictly following her advice and maintaining a regular exercise routine. Dr. Vimala is undoubtedly the best and most supportive doctor I have ever met. Thank you, doctor, for all your support :-)",

I've gone for pregnancy treatment for 2nd kid with some complications between my 1st and 2nd pregnancy and sharing my personal experience. \n\nShe has been the best doctor in treating me with utmost care. She always used to treat for what is absolutely required and avoid unnecessary medication, unnecessary tests.  Listens very patiently and clarifies all the doubts even if it takes time. She never used to rush when talking with patients and gives all the comfort to clarify even silly questions, doesn't get irritated and understands the patient's situation and consoles along with reasoning. She explains the solutions in easily understandable manner (in layman terms). Always available for any help over mobile if anything urgent. \n\nMore importantly, she highly prefers normal delivery and encourages required exercises if necessary. We were about to get baby delivered 1 month early but with her proper guidance (many thanks!), we are blessed with healthy baby girl at the right week.  \n\nWe still remember she came in lightening fast to hospital during the delivery time (almost like driving an ambulance) and didn't allow anyone else to take chance / to perform procedure on her behalf (Many many thanks ma'am). She was there until complete procedure and greeted with smile once delivery is completed. We can't forget the help, guidance, support, which she has provided through out our 2nd pregnancy journey. \n\nWe wish her to help more and more people and brings the happiness in their lives. May God bless her to fulfill her wishes, gives her and her family with good health. \n\nThanks a ton to Dr. Vimala Chapala ma'am! We wouldn't have been this much happy without her support. \n\nYours lovingly, \nSharada & Siva.",

Dr. Vimla Chapala\u2019s name came up as a first option on our search for a good doctor on the net. Trusting the google analytics we decided to go ahead with Dr. Vimla, in Apollo Cradle and Child Hospital, Brookfield , Bangalore. Right from getting an appointment for consultation our experience has been exceptionally positive. Suggesting a Proposed line of treatment: Hysteroscopy with D And C and explaining in detail the full implications in a soft assuring tone -I could see Dr. Vimla possessed the three fundamental qualities one looks for in a doctor - credibility, professionalism, and ethics. Once the Hysteroscopy with D and C was carried out - and examining the test reports it became clear that a hysterectomy was also needed. Once again we were in the safest hands and Dr Vimla followed a very thorough process of taking the inputs of an eminent Neurologist and an equally eminent Physician, this covering all other implications before moving ahead with the line of treatment. Dr. Vimla has a highly skilful  hand and in all her procedures and she takes  extra care to make the process as painless as possible.\nWhen I exchanged notes with my relations and friends and heard  some of the most horrifying experiences - even as I relax on the bed in post operative care , I felt a compulsive urge to let women know that such post-menopausal treatments need not be a torture in terms  of physical , psychological or economic hardship. And if we have Good Doctors like Vimla - we can still retain our pride in our womanhood and bounce back to a normal life. I strongly recommend this doctor.\n",

Her guidance was outstanding, helping to alleviate my fears and anxieties.\nShe recommended specific exercises to promote a normal delivery, which I followed diligently. I didn't need to join any additional yoga classes or other programs. I was able to deliver my baby naturally just by strictly following her advice and maintaining a regular exercise routine. Dr. Vimala is undoubtedly the best and most supportive doctor I have ever met. Thank you, doctor, for all your support :-)",

I've gone for pregnancy treatment for 2nd kid with some complications between my 1st and 2nd pregnancy and sharing my personal experience. \n\nShe has been the best doctor in treating me with utmost care. She always used to treat for what is absolutely required and avoid unnecessary medication, unnecessary tests.  Listens very patiently and clarifies all the doubts even if it takes time. She never used to rush when talking with patients and gives all the comfort to clarify even silly questions, doesn't get irritated and understands the patient's situation and consoles along with reasoning. She explains the solutions in easily understandable manner (in layman terms). Always available for any help over mobile if anything urgent. \n\nMore importantly, she highly prefers normal delivery and encourages required exercises if necessary. We were about to get baby delivered 1 month early but with her proper guidance (many thanks!), we are blessed with healthy baby girl at the right week.  \n\nWe still remember she came in lightening fast to hospital during the delivery time (almost like driving an ambulance) and didn't allow anyone else to take chance / to perform procedure on her behalf (Many many thanks ma'am). She was there until complete procedure and greeted with smile once delivery is completed. We can't forget the help, guidance, support, which she has provided through out our 2nd pregnancy journey. \n\nWe wish her to help more and more people and brings the happiness in their lives. May God bless her to fulfill her wishes, gives her and her family with good health. \n\nThanks a ton to Dr. Vimala Chapala ma'am! We wouldn't have been this much happy without her support. \n\nYours lovingly, \nSharada & Siva.",

Dr. Vimla Chapala\u2019s name came up as a first option on our search for a good doctor on the net. Trusting the google analytics we decided to go ahead with Dr. Vimla, in Apollo Cradle and Child Hospital, Brookfield , Bangalore. Right from getting an appointment for consultation our experience has been exceptionally positive. Suggesting a Proposed line of treatment: Hysteroscopy with D And C and explaining in detail the full implications in a soft assuring tone -I could see Dr. Vimla possessed the three fundamental qualities one looks for in a doctor - credibility, professionalism, and ethics. Once the Hysteroscopy with D and C was carried out - and examining the test reports it became clear that a hysterectomy was also needed. Once again we were in the safest hands and Dr Vimla followed a very thorough process of taking the inputs of an eminent Neurologist and an equally eminent Physician, this covering all other implications before moving ahead with the line of treatment. Dr. Vimla has a highly skilful  hand and in all her procedures and she takes  extra care to make the process as painless as possible.\nWhen I exchanged notes with my relations and friends and heard  some of the most horrifying experiences - even as I relax on the bed in post operative care , I felt a compulsive urge to let women know that such post-menopausal treatments need not be a torture in terms  of physical , psychological or economic hardship. And if we have Good Doctors like Vimla - we can still retain our pride in our womanhood and bounce back to a normal life. I strongly recommend this doctor.\n",

My wife had a little complicated pregnancy where she had diabetes starting the day she conceived and gall stones.Dr Vimala was cognizant of these complications since the beginning and kept a close watch on any symptoms that may require immediate attention. She was kind enough to suggest good Endocrinologist and Gastro doctors to keep a regular check on diabetes and ICP. Moreover she was extremely approachable on phone/WhatsApp anytime my wife had a minor discomfort. We lived a little far from Trinity and keeping that in mind many times the reports were consulted on the phone so as to avoid travel. Overall it was really great having her by our side all this time.On the day of the water break we were able to talk to her post mid night and follow her instructions. After all these complications i can say overall she took great care of my pregnancy/baby. We were in Apollo Cradle where she helped with the C Section delivery.We are grateful to her.",

She was able to guide me well on my each & every concern and cleared all my doubts which kept me confident through the entire journey. She's a perfect blend of good human being and a doctor. Most humble, polite, positive and off course most capable which always keeps her patient's at ease.\nI requested for a C-section because of my labour agony, but my doctor stood beside me and helped me sail through the normal delivery process, plus I had many concerns during my labour pain, which Dr Vimala managed it very well and kept motivating me and my family.\nDr Vimala's dedication to her patient is commendable. She was always available on the phone whenever I needed her support. Having such a dedicated and selfless doctor in today's world is a blessing, I'm so grateful and thankful to her always.\nI would strongly recommend everyone to consult my doctor(Dr Vimala Chapala) and get best advice at all the time.",

She always patiently listened to what I had to say and would always come back with good advice and suggestions. She encouraged me from the very beginning that she will ensure I have a normal delivery. She gave proper advise regarding medication and exercises and all thanks to her I am now a proud mumma of a healthy baby. \nI will definitely recommend doctor Vimala to my  friend s and relatives.Pregnancy is a tough journey and a good gynaecologist eases the pre delivery period with kind words and good treatment.

She treats you very well, she has a way of making you feel like you\u2019re not just a patient.\nShe is very quick responsive over Wats-up and keeps following up/monitor from her side. She never suggests any unnecessary tests and medications. Her aim is always delivering a healthy baby in normal delivery. I really felt in control over the situation and was able to use her as an educated resource to help me make the best decision possible.\nDue to some reason, I had to change doctor at 8th month of my pregnancy, I was very afraid about this. But once we Consulted Vimala Madam, I was very happy and got confidence that I have chosen right person. I never thought that, I will have normal delivery, but it happened only with the help of Dr. Vimala Madam. I was very afraid of labor pains, but it went very well and smooth with her support. The procedure and the treatment she offered was awesome. She went above and beyond during my labor, finally I gave birth to healthy baby girl through NVD without epidural.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr. Vimala Madam.\n\nThank you So much Vimala Mam for all this, \n*** *** ****** ********",

To my surprise, she was exactly what I was looking for in a doctor that is I did not want c section birth at all. Since the starting she suggested what exercise to do in which month so that my natural labour period can be minimised during delivery. She gave me confidence I was looking for. I have lean body structure but she filled me with confidence that I can do it. She had discussed all options of pain relief during labour when she saw me worried but explained pros and cons for the same. She helped me getting prepared for it that is natural process of delivery. I m really thankful for her suggestion of getting induced after finishing 39 weeks. My entire labour process just took 4-5 hours because of her advice.  I would definitely recommend her to my friends and people in my circle to take her help in case you are looking for normal vaginal delivery.",

For delivery, she and Dr. Nethra ensured that my husband and I were in the know for even the smallest of the decisions. We were explained thoroughly about the injections that were given, the procedures that were being followed. They both went above and beyond to ensure that the best decisions for me and the baby were carried out. They were immensely patient and extraordinarily encouraging throughout the process. As doctors, Dr Vimala and Dr Nethra have our highest recommendation and admiration.)]\n",

Through out my pregnancy she suggested exercises, diets etc to stay healthy and also handled my anxieties so well. She is also so calm and friendly  that you can ask her any silly doubts without any second thoughts and she also responds to all your WhatsApp queries irrespective of the time.She always encourages you to go for a normal delivery bt due to certain last minute complications I had to undergo an emergency c-section.  But both me and my baby are absolutely fine.If anyone is searching for a gynec who eases your tension and keeps you calm throughout the entire journey then Dr.Vimala Chapala is the go to person :)",

The day we met, we are in the cross roads about the condition of the baby. While we interact with her - we slowly gained confidence and assured ourselves whatever the complications which we thought off is not actual things . Earlier going for a checkup is a scary thing , after we started to visit Dr Vimal  it was a pleasant, interactive and tension free Sessions along with right Guidance at right time. She is ready to answer queries at any point of time and don't discourage us to ask further more. The efforts Dr Vimal took while treating my Wife during pre and post pregnancy commendable and really appreciable. Post pregnancy -  Kid and wife are in good health. \n\nThank you so much Doctor for your support. I would you like to recommend to my friends and relatives. ",

She wont stick to  5-10 min of consultation timeframe which i observed in other doctors. She spares as much time as you want. She made every consultation session so comfortable for me. Finally, I delivered my baby via vaginal delivery with her support and guidance.. Hands down, i would recommend Dr. Vimala. Unlike others, she would always encourage for vaginal delivery. During my labour process, doctor and her staff continuously motivated me to not give up in between. Once again , I would like to thank Dr. Vimala for an amazing pregnancy and delivery experience.",

Every visit she would take time to patiently listen and never allowed us to lose hope. When my wife finally convinced Dr. Vimala took great care of both mother and child! Even during this Covid 19 situation, Dr. Vimala would personally enquire about health and child's growth. My wife had a smooth delivery and the child  super healthy.Thank you so much Dr. Vimala.

She took special care *** *** *** ********* *** *********** ************ She ensured that my wife will  have natural delivery. Throughout the pregnancy she was very friendly and reachable all the time even on phone. The way Vimala mam handled on the delivery day was commendable (my wife could not bare pains and was looking for C-section but as doctor said on Day1, she made normal delivery possible).\nWe are blessed with a baby boy and its all because of the extra care and support that the doctor provided from day 1 to delivery date. Its not only the treatment that she provides, its actually the time, care, counseling she provides makes her the best out of others. Me and my family are forever grateful to her. Of course, we strongly recommend Dr. Vimala mam.",

Once she was not in the city so I had to visit some other gynecologist, to be very honest, I was not comfortable. So I waited for her to come back and continued with her...on 22nd of may I delivered a baby boy...it was her support otherwise I was very upset as it was a premature...she gave me confidence and also assured that she will not let anything bad happen to me or my child. Even after delivery she visited regularly to see me in hospital and that too this pandemic Corona situation and suggested some best practices after delivery...she was always available there on the phone if I need her or I need any suggestions. I feel she is like my elder sister or family member....lucky to have a doctor like her...some one said that doctors are the God on earth..by looking at her dedication I can say this is true....thank you so much would be very tiny as compare to your support...may God bless her....\n\nRajni chauhan",

Even though we stay 20kms away from the hospital we still travelled this far only because of Dr. Vimala . She is very supportive, energetic, cheering smile, motivator and soft spoken person.  Also at any point of time if any doubts and concerns during the pregnency she use clear our doubts and recommend medicines. All our family were worried about last minute difficulties we faced but she made it look easy and it was a normal delivery. \nWe would always recommend Dr. Vimala Chapala for her great work \ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90",
