Then we met doctor deepmala in june 2022 for the problem in conceiving as I was having pcos and thyroid....I was so depressed and eager to conceive that I told her that I want to conceive at the earliest but doctor deepmala unlike other doctors told me to start following a healthy diet along with regular exercise in order to reduce weight.She didn't even  gave me HCG injections neither told me to get the follicular study done every alternate day..and also she told me to wait for 3-4 months then we will look into other options . All these 3-4 months I started doing gym to reduce my weight and followed a healthy diet but one thing kept clicking my mind that all these 2 years nothing has happened and i couldn't conceive then what new  will happen now..Then in oct 2022 I again met doctor deepmala for regular check up...she was happy seeing my weight loss and encouraged me to further to reduce my weight.she gave me minimal medicines.\nWith god's grace and doctor deepmala's advice i conceived in nov 2022...doctor deepmala gave me proper advice in follow up check ups and also sometimes scolded me when I was taking taking care of myself during pregnancy.My LFT ,SGPT and SGOT was little bit higher so every now and then I called and messaged doctor deepmala and she was always available over phone.My due date was in July 2023 but Doctor deepmala adviced me for a early delivery as i had problems with the increased levels of LFT,SGPT,SGOT.But she was sure that my delivery will be normal only.I got admitted on 24th June ....Dr deepmala was in constant touch will the staff of the delivery room .The moment junior doctors informed Dr deepmala that situation is not good for the baby,she rushed from her home to hospital at 12 'o clock in the night..I was shifted to OT and my C Section was done.I gave birth to a lovely baby girl...it has all happened because of Dr deepmala....She has made my 9 months  journey easy and made it possible for me to enjoy the journey to motherhood with happiness.Dr deepmala has made us parents which we were thinking is not in our fate.\nI would strongly recommend all ladies  to consult Dr deepmala and see the magic ....** ******** * * *** *****\nThanks a lot mam\nNandini and Ajit\nAnd load of love from cutie VAIDEHI\n\n",

Then she patiently answered the questions related to the issue , provided encouragement, and ensured that my comfort was prioritized throughout the entire process. When the big day arrived, we went to hospital around 7.30 pm and Dr. Deepamala asked the staff to shift my wife to the labor room as the doctor wants try for normal delivery first before she attempts the C-section. Dr. Deepamala is an absolute Rockstar. Her calm and composed demeanor, coupled with her expertise, guided my wife through every stage of labor, making feel safe and supported. Overnight, Dr. Deepamala monitored my wife's condition by calling the staff and next day Dr. Deepamala  is present in the hospital at 6 am and the moment my baby was born, I was overwhelmed with joy and relief. Dr. Deepamala skillfully managed the delivery, ensuring both my baby's and my wife's safety. Her attentiveness, expertise, and quick decision-making skills were truly remarkable and played a significant role in a smooth and uncomplicated delivery. Me and my wife will be forever grateful to Dr. Deepamala for her exceptional care, professionalism, and dedication. Thanks to her expertise and unwavering support, I was able to welcome my baby into the world in the safest and most joyous manner possible. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Deepamala to any expectant mother seeking the best possible care throughout her pregnancy journey. Her remarkable skills, compassionate approach, and commitment to the well-being of both mother and baby make her an exceptional gynecologist and obstetrician.\n\nThank you, Dr. Deepamala, for making my wife's pregnancy and delivery experience truly unforgettable.

They have been exceptional throughout.\nSince we were having our first child, it was very important for us to find a Doctor who can understand the anxiety in new parents but not for a single moment we felt clueless. They made sure all our doubts were clarified, there were proper guidance on DO's and DONT's. Not in a single visit we were unhappy about choosing this hospital and thank God for Dr. Deepmala and her associate Dr. Suchi.. you both were amazing so thank you for all the support!!\nI highly recommend Motherhood Sarjapur Road and highly recommend consulting Dr. Deepmala\n\nThe reason I am marked four star is because our experience with the billing department was not very pleasant. We were treated as if they were the one paying for all the consultation and delivery. It is not just for us but anyone who visited around the same time with us had a similar experience. There is a lot they need to do make things smooth during the process because this is one of the most critical aspect for new parents or even any parents.",

Being suffered from one miscarriage in 2020   We were saddened and that stress impacted me with not being able to conceive for 4 months in straight . We had enquired many good gynic in Bangalore and finally visited  Mam at @motherhood Sarjapur . First approach of Mam towards our issue was so confidence giving, she made us feel like nothing is wrong with us . She treated us with less medicine and more positivity and the good news was with us in a month. The entire pregnancy consultation with Mam is a very much good experience for us . She took care of every minute details and guided us with do\u2019s and don\u2019t. Mam always available over call and whatsapp to respond any urgent quieted Now we are proud parents of a beautiful angel . She also has advised to the nutrition and diet part (pre and post pregnancy ). Dr Deepmala mam along with Dr Suchi Mam from motherhood has played a very important role in our parenthood journey. We will cherish this for life . I highly recommend Dr Deepmala mam .\n\nRegards\nSumana and Kausik",

She delivered our first born on 21 Dec'17. We were recommended by Doctor Gowhar (an excellent doctor) to Doctor Deepmala, for which me and my wife will always be extremely grateful. The way she quickly deduces and tackles each issue / query (big or small) is remarkable. Her warm smile, professionalism, personal touch / care, willingness to answer all queries, penchant for humor (even during tense moments in Labor Room) dispensed all our fears and made us feel in the safest of all hands. The way she motivates, guides to do right things and dispel all fears is striking. She has given us an indelible experience of a lifetime which we will cherish forever, story of which we will tell our Daughter once she grows up. We spoke to other parents during our first born's delivery and all shared similar feedback for her. She is a credit to Motherhood, the hospital is lucky to have her. Hence from our personal experience we would recommend all to blindly put their trust / worries in Doctor Deepmala\u2019s capable hands.\n\nMadhumita & Shubhendu",

Her approach was less medicines more meditation and yoga . She gave only multivitamin to my husband and iron to me and within one month we got positive results. This time both me and doctor were more cautious she took all the necessary steps to make my pregnancy viable. My first trimester was a bumpy ride where i got spotting pain and what not she gave me injections and every time I visited her her smile made me more confident and positive. During my third trimester sometimes I use to feel less baby movements for that she use to call me and check how I am feeling. I never saw any doctor calling her patient to check there well being. She is just amazing. During my 37 th week I got lose stool which we got to know later was due to Covid. She delivered my baby immediately. I was very scared that being Covid positive I should not breast feed my angel but she again gave me the boost I needed and I continue breastfeeding. Now my baby is 1 month old. All I have is gratitude and thankfulness in my heart for Doctor Deepmala. She is one of the best doctor I have ever seen. I will always recommend her.\n\nThanks and regards\nAnshika and Priyank",

Her approach towards every pregnancy stage was very natural; be it diet or medication. Every pregnant woman is different and she knows it very well as she handled my wife\u2019s issues uniquely and accurately.\nEach time we go to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She pays attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity. As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions/issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding on WhatsApp every time; be it day or night. This helped us a lot throughout our pregnancy.\nComing to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. We thank you, Dr. Deepmala, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything, you have a lioness\u2019s share in the joy that our baby\u2019s birth has given us.\nWe would strongly recommend her.\n",

Then we met doctor deepmala in june 2022 for the problem in conceiving as I was having pcos and thyroid....I was so depressed and eager to conceive that I told her that I want to conceive at the earliest but doctor deepmala unlike other doctors told me to start following a healthy diet along with regular exercise in order to reduce weight.She didn't even  gave me HCG injections neither told me to get the follicular study done every alternate day..and also she told me to wait for 3-4 months then we will look into other options . All these 3-4 months I started doing gym to reduce my weight and followed a healthy diet but one thing kept clicking my mind that all these 2 years nothing has happened and i couldn't conceive then what new  will happen now..Then in oct 2022 I again met doctor deepmala for regular check up...she was happy seeing my weight loss and encouraged me to further to reduce my weight.she gave me minimal medicines.\nWith god's grace and doctor deepmala's advice i conceived in nov 2022...doctor deepmala gave me proper advice in follow up check ups and also sometimes scolded me when I was taking taking care of myself during pregnancy.My LFT ,SGPT and SGOT was little bit higher so every now and then I called and messaged doctor deepmala and she was always available over phone.My due date was in July 2023 but Doctor deepmala adviced me for a early delivery as i had problems with the increased levels of LFT,SGPT,SGOT.But she was sure that my delivery will be normal only.I got admitted on 24th June ....Dr deepmala was in constant touch will the staff of the delivery room .The moment junior doctors informed Dr deepmala that situation is not good for the baby,she rushed from her home to hospital at 12 'o clock in the night..I was shifted to OT and my C Section was done.I gave birth to a lovely baby girl...it has all happened because of Dr deepmala....She has made my 9 months  journey easy and made it possible for me to enjoy the journey to motherhood with happiness.Dr deepmala has made us parents which we were thinking is not in our fate.\nI would strongly recommend all ladies  to consult Dr deepmala and see the magic ....** ******** * * *** *****\nThanks a lot mam\nNandini and Ajit\nAnd load of love from cutie VAIDEHI\n\n",

Then she patiently answered the questions related to the issue , provided encouragement, and ensured that my comfort was prioritized throughout the entire process.

They have been exceptional throughout.\nSince we were having our first child, it was very important for us to find a Doctor who can understand the anxiety in new parents but not for a single moment we felt clueless. They made sure all our doubts were clarified, there were proper guidance on DO's and DONT's. Not in a single visit we were unhappy about choosing this hospital and thank God for Dr. Deepmala and her associate Dr. Suchi.. you both were amazing so thank you for all the support!!\nI highly recommend Motherhood Sarjapur Road and highly recommend consulting Dr. Deepmala\n\nThe reason I am marked four star is because our experience with the billing department was not very pleasant. We were treated as if they were the one paying for all the consultation and delivery. It is not just for us but anyone who visited around the same time with us had a similar experience. There is a lot they need to do make things smooth during the process because this is one of the most critical aspect for new parents or even any parents.",

Being suffered from one miscarriage in 2020   We were saddened and that stress impacted me with not being able to conceive for 4 months in straight . We had enquired many good gynic in Bangalore and finally visited  Mam at @motherhood Sarjapur . First approach of Mam towards our issue was so confidence giving, she made us feel like nothing is wrong with us . She treated us with less medicine and more positivity and the good news was with us in a month. The entire pregnancy consultation with Mam is a very much good experience for us . She took care of every minute details and guided us with do\u2019s and don\u2019t. Mam always available over call and whatsapp to respond any urgent quieted Now we are proud parents of a beautiful angel . She also has advised to the nutrition and diet part (pre and post pregnancy ). Dr Deepmala mam along with Dr Suchi Mam from motherhood has played a very important role in our parenthood journey. We will cherish this for life . I highly recommend Dr Deepmala mam .\n\nRegards\nSumana and Kausik",

She delivered our first born on 21 Dec'17. We were recommended by Doctor Gowhar (an excellent doctor) to Doctor Deepmala, for which me and my wife will always be extremely grateful. The way she quickly deduces and tackles each issue / query (big or small) is remarkable. Her warm smile, professionalism, personal touch / care, willingness to answer all queries, penchant for humor (even during tense moments in Labor Room) dispensed all our fears and made us feel in the safest of all hands. The way she motivates, guides to do right things and dispel all fears is striking. She has given us an indelible experience of a lifetime which we will cherish forever, story of which we will tell our Daughter once she grows up. We spoke to other parents during our first born's delivery and all shared similar feedback for her. She is a credit to Motherhood, the hospital is lucky to have her. Hence from our personal experience we would recommend all to blindly put their trust / worries in Doctor Deepmala\u2019s capable hands.\n\nMadhumita & Shubhendu",

Her approach was less medicines more meditation and yoga . She gave only multivitamin to my husband and iron to me and within one month we got positive results. This time both me and doctor were more cautious she took all the necessary steps to make my pregnancy viable. My first trimester was a bumpy ride where i got spotting pain and what not she gave me injections and every time I visited her her smile made me more confident and positive. During my third trimester sometimes I use to feel less baby movements for that she use to call me and check how I am feeling. I never saw any doctor calling her patient to check there well being. She is just amazing. During my 37 th week I got lose stool which we got to know later was due to Covid. She delivered my baby immediately. I was very scared that being Covid positive I should not breast feed my angel but she again gave me the boost I needed and I continue breastfeeding. Now my baby is 1 month old. All I have is gratitude and thankfulness in my heart for Doctor Deepmala. She is one of the best doctor I have ever seen. I will always recommend her.\n\nThanks and regards\nAnshika and Priyank",

Her approach towards every pregnancy stage was very natural; be it diet or medication. Every pregnant woman is different and she knows it very well as she handled my wife\u2019s issues uniquely and accurately.\nEach time we go to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She pays attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity. As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions/issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding on WhatsApp every time; be it day or night. This helped us a lot throughout our pregnancy.\nComing to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. We thank you, Dr. Deepmala, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything, you have a lioness\u2019s share in the joy that our baby\u2019s birth has given us.\nWe would strongly recommend her.\n",

We had an amazing experience with her throughout our journey of 9 months of pregnancy. One thing that stood out personally for me was that she always took a safety first and precaution first approach which resonated well with our thought process of delivering the baby.In the middle of 2nd month in our first trimester we had a minor bleeding scare due to low lying placenta condition but doctor helped us promptly and my wife recovered after 2 nights in hospital.Post the eventful 1st trimester, the 2nd and 3rd trimester was relatively much smoother as doctor had suggested the right medication and even stopped the medication in a phased gradual reduction manner. Finally, Dr Deepmala delivered our baby girl through C-section after 37 weeks 5 days of pregnancy and both me and my wife are very grateful to her for delivering our baby without any challenges and post pregnancy complications.

We recommend her to everyone looking for a gynecologist.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy and also after delivery, she has been very approachable and gave personal care, attention and her time. She never gave any fancy-pancy-heavy-on-pocket advises. She never rushed through any appointment and answered all the questions, important and silly ones, with patience. She encouraged that I ask as many questions as I wanted so that I go to the delivery table with as little doubts as possible. The best thing about her is that she encourages normal delivery. \n\nMy husband and I would like to thank her for the amazing person and Doctor that she is!",

After suffering from 2 miscarriages earlier and 7yrs of marriage I had almost lost trust that  I will be able to deliver a healthy baby. When I was pregnant in feb 2020 I started consulting another well known hospital and doctor till 4th month. Every visit was traumatic for me and made me more negative. Finally I decided to change doctor and my friend recommended Dr Deepmala. My first consultation with her made me feel I am in the right hands finally. Such a friendly and warm doctor. Despite not having family and friends during pregnancy due to covid I never felt alone. In 7th month  covid hit me and again I was scared. I had gone weak and low oxygen level. Dr Deepmala helped me sail through the bad phase checking on me through whatsApp and being virtually there all the time for me. I finally delivered in Oct 2020. I cannot thank Dr Deepmala enough for all she has done to me. She is God for me. ",

But she made it so comfortable and ease that the whole pregnancy period went well. Her positive attitude and friendliness is the best. Her smile just takes away each and every concern that you have. She greets everyone in the bestest way. She shows so much patience to listen and discuss the issues which we have. One thing she always said was 'It's not important whether to have normal or C section, most important is baby and the mother'. She also interacted for queries thru whatsapp which very less doctors do. Her pleasant behavior in OT to keep me relax and relieve just worked like magic and I gave birth to a cute baby boy. Thank you so much maam for your support throughout these 9 months. I would surely recommend my near and dear ones to consult her for obg services. ",

But Dr deepmala has helped me to come over all the fear and doubts she is so friendly and never scares a patient unnecessarily instead she brings in confidence in you by her encouraging words. She is so calm and patient and listens to you carefully also suggests appropriate treatment at right time. My biggest surprise was when she said even after 10 years of late pregnancy I can go for normal delivery which I have preferred always. At the time of delivery she was so so good as a Dr and delivered my baby girl through normal delivery. Can't thank her enough , she came like a true goddess in my life.",

Also, she didn't ask for any previous medications taken. What really pissed us off was the fact that she was looking into her mobile when we were talking to her. When I mentioned this to her and she got angry at us.  It was around 9:45 pm and we got an impression that she wanted to finish off her day somehow. Very unprofessional behaviour from her part. Would never recommend this doctor to anyone.",

At 35 week when I had AFI+doppler scan, all our peace was gone when we got to know that our baby had 2 loops of cord around her neck(first pregnancy). Ma\u2019m suggested C-sec immediately if we dont want to take the slightest risk but was also very supportive when we dint want to undergo csec all of a sudden as we were worried for the baby\u2019s growth. She suggested to track baby movements, any slight change in that we were asked to rush to emergency room, and every 3rd day we had to get an NST done. She supported us very well through this and was always available over call and chat. I finally delivered the baby at 37wks+3 days  elective csec as baby\u2019s movements were lesser than before, heartbeat was not as stable as always, mucous plus was out before which brown discharge had started, cervix had opened 2cm and baby was nowhere near pelvis. Ma\u2019m always told us that she will support us till baby and mother are safe, once she finds anything unstable she will ask us to undergo csection. She supported us till the end. I am forever grateful to ma\u2019m for staying with us through our first pregnancy and the tough times in it. Will surely recommend her to friends and family.",

As the due date approached, I felt fully prepared for labor and delivery, thanks to the extensive guidance and information provided by Dr. Deepmala.  She took the time to explain the entire birthing process, discussing various options and ensuring that my birth plan aligned with my preferences and medical requirements.",

After 10 days I had been to her just to show the report but I feel it's  not right to change a consultation of 400 Rs just for showing a report.

You enter her room with a lot of queries and come out with clear and peaceful mind. Deepmala is very spontaneous in analysing reports, scans and actions to be taken as per patient condition. Dr.Deepmala always suggests simple techniques incase you face any issues during pregnancy.Her presence in labour room makes the patient stress free even in those tough times. And the staff at the hospital were also friendly and helpful all the times. Just a simple thank you is not sufficient for making me deliver a healthy baby girl\ud83d\ude00",

To me, she is a magician, a great physician, a special gift from God. She suggested me few medicine and tests. I took some time, but finally I conceived. She was more happier than me that day. My entire journey through out the pregnancy was smooth because of her. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Thank you so much Dr. deepmala. You are such a wonderful person and you always made me feel so safe. Thank you for being positive , supportive when I gave up my hopes. You are an amazing doctor.",

We finally got our turn around 1pm as there was a queue. Not sure if they were also via practo or direct walk-in. But it seems there FCFS was used rather than appointment time. This was our 1St visit so not sure about the medication and treatment just yet.",
