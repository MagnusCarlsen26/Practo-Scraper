None,None,0,0,YES,"***The way she examines and explains everything is really commendable.***I couldn't have felt more comfortable with any other doctor for all of my pregnancy scans. Also while checking current patient, she makes sure her next patients are not waiting unnecessarily in line for long but that also doesn't mean she will overlook current patient. She checks everything and explains those at the end very well.Really liked this that she respects everyone s time and the slot they have booked her for.
