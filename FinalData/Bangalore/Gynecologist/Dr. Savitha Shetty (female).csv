So I went to her for irregular periods. She gave me some tablets that helped but time spent in trying to explain what was actually going on with me was zero. In fact when I simply asked ""What exactly should I tell a dietitian if they ask me what my condition is"" rather than stating what was going on or taking the time out to explain things to me, she just brushed it off and said ""Show them your scan they will get it"". She has zero concern for trying to make the patient understand what is going on. Apart from this, time spent in general is extremely limited, looks like she's always in a hurry to get somewhere and she's doing us a favor? Terrible.

None,"Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"Doctor suggested all the tests worth around 10K and later upon getting all the tests done with all efforts, Doctor do not have patience to answer our queries,
Doctor will be completely in hurry burry state of mind.

Everything was well in the first visit and upon next visit, doctor have separate time to check the follow up patients itseems and we Never knew that, or if we go outside of that time we have to pay itseems.

Not recommended for the newly married couple if you are visiting to this doctor.

I know doctor will be having all the answers for the questions asked but even we should know what are those answers right, just yes yes yes.. will never answer our question. 

You have to wait for days together to get your reports done at Apollo and Never expect on spot reports, schedule your appointment and wait for reports at the Report counter till they provide and even in Apollo clinic you will never get ORS solution.

And doctor had to reply I am with a high risk patient so I have to discuss in detail with patient.  I am not wasting time here. 

Hospital facilities people are forcing doctor to finish appointment with patients soon,  so that other patients need not wait much. 

I know Dr savitha madam,  she is very responsible towards a patient,  she never does time pass with patient. I request the hospital authority,never force doctor to finish the patient appointment soon. 

I request hospital to have clean and smell free restroom in -1 floor.
