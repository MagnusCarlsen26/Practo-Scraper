None,None,0,0,YES,"****** ** **** ***** She is 
Very friendly in nature. Diagnosis the problems very early and gives treatment accordingly. We should just follow the doctor's advice & you can see the result definitely. She is so kind & down to earth. We have two kids both were monitored by the doctor during pregnancy, we just followed her advice and that's the result what we got. I would suggest the doctor to anybody for good results. But believe in this doctor. 
Thank you doctor you will be rembered in our life forever.
