She explained in detail the whole process as to how she will proceed and things that we need to take care of. She is someone who will advise you to focus on your health, diet, exercise, stress level and not rely only on meds. What we loved about her is that she didn\u2019t make any tall claims nor any false promises. She respected our decision of going ahead with one cycle of IUI even when she knew it may not be successful. My whole process of IVF was very smooth under her guidance and I conceived in my first cycle. \nThings are not mechanical here. Everyone in Mannat, be it the ladies at the reception desk, the team of sisters led by the amazing Rajmani sister, Dr.Trina, the lab technicians or Dr.Archana, will always greet you with a smile, ask about your health or if your eating well, calm you down when you are stressed. There is  a sense of comfort and  positivity here. I highly recommend Mannat.",

With all the facilities like samples collection, scans, etc in the hospital itself put me in very comfortable position. \nWe had a 2-year-old baby and with him playing and making noise, the staff was also kind enough to support us and we never felt that we are disturbing. \nWe are very thankful for Dr.Archana.\n",

She make us understand the real situation and what she is going to do to handle that and how that will work very well. Done regular and timely checkups, and answers every possible query even the silliest one.\n\nWe were having feelings of something good is going to happen and in the 2nd try only the reults came positive. We are going to be parents soon, and this is because of Dr Archana.\nMANNAT came as blessings in our life . Thanku so much Archana mam.",

Trust me, at times she had spent almost an hour just counseling us. We had got all kinds of guidance, information and support from her till the delivery of the baby.  I can't take a little credit away from of others staffs like, Dr Shabia , Dr Anjali . Everyone were very approachable , supportive and helpful. I strongly recommend everyone who have fertility issue to Mannat . This will be a step towards parenting :).",

Whenever we visit her, her positive attitude lifts us up and gives us hope and one can discuss anything with her freely. Dr. Meenakshi too is helpful and supportive, she always answers our queries very patiently. Dr. Kavya is also very good .The sisters (Lidsy, Rajmani and others ) are equally reliable and caring. The two front desk staff are very responsive and prompt . Overall an excellent team .All the medical facilities are excellent and state of the art. We highly recommend Mannat fertility, wish them all the best and pray that everyone seeking help here is blessed by the divine for parenthood.",

Since I was already 35 by then, mam suggested to go for IVF. She suggested only required reports to be done and we started getting faith in her treatment. Even though, first cycle failed but it was all smooth like egg pickup, embroyo transfer procedures. Staff is really good. Special thanks to Rajmani sis for being like friend and always supporting. Thanks to Sabeeha mam as well for answering all our queries whenever asked. After first failed one, we were told to go for few more reports and exact problem was found. Then I was on medicines for the same and then did transfer. And finally it clicked 3rd time. Today we are very happy and thankful to Archana mam and her team for giving us joy of parenthood.",

I have been going to treatment with Archana for 7 years.  I had couple of IVF treatments done.  I had miscarriages but I never lost hope or trust in mannat. They treated the same way every time I go there. Archana maam knows what she is doing . she is well experienced. Very friendly and has lot of patience. Big smile on the face gives so much relief and confidence. I went for IVF treatment again in June 2022. Currently I am 8 months and waiting for the baby. I can feel the baby kicks and movements which is really good feeling. Thank you Mannat team for everything. Some tips for IVF treatment1. Do not take stress2. Be very normal with your day to day activities3. Go for walk. walking was really helpful for me. but whatever possible.4. Eat healthy food. whole grains, eggs, legumes, veggies, milk or milk products and lots of different fruits. select veggies and fruits with different colors.5. If working then good. if not, then try to be active in your hobbies.6. Practice mindful meditation. take care as if you are already pregnant and be positive. Everything else will fall in place.7. last but not least...pray to God. ",

After this I took a gap of 6 months and changed doctor and she again tried 3 IUI and 1 egg pickup and 3 transfers which did not give me any result but ended only in pain of taking injections everyday during the cycle. Lost all the hope and then I read reviews of Mannat clinic and Saw that Dr. Archana was one almost the top doctors and decided to change doctor again and went to Mannat clinic I am 9 weeks pregnant now, I must say the entire team of Dr. Archana know how infertility is troubling our life's. There is positively in the clinic. They majorly focus on what the problem is, like in my case all my reports used be normal but I used to take lot of stress, she suggested to go to healer and that helped me I feelI am sure you will have personal touch in Mannat clinicJust leave everything to Dr. Archana, I am sure she will make you parentsSince I have been to 3 doctors, I definitely see a change here in Mannat clinic",

We usually spend more time waiting at the hospital to talk to doctor, but here it wasn\u2019t that longer wait.\n\nDuring our first appointment she was very open to listen to all that we have to say about out past history. she was very clear on her plan to do. Though we had couple unsuccessful IVF cycles but Dr Archana used to take it as a challenge, tested few to exactly know the problem. Whenever we talked to Dr Archana her trust gives us a positive vibes and motivations and then finally we have got that positive Cycle. After hearing this it was not just we who were very happy, but all the staff also which felt like a family members. It was a great experiance\n\nThanks to all the team of Dr Archana (Dr Meenakshi , all Sisters and Receptionist\u2019s ) who really took care during this process.\n",

On top of that, the best part is I concieved during my first ivf cycle which itself is\u00a0 dream come true for us. After going through several other centre's to get correct advice, when we reached here, we felt lot of positivity during first visit.Dr. Archana & Mr Sanjay Agrawal explained everything in detail and answered all my questions with patience. We don't get feeling like a hospital when we visit Mannat, as it's so clean and ambience is extremely good and refreshing. Since the ivf treatment involves several visits to the hospital and during this pandemic time it becomes very imp to manage patients waiting lounge with proper care. At Mannat, we enter stress free with sitting areas placed well apart for individual patients with minimal waiting time to seek consultation, which is not the case at other centres in Bangalore.Reception Staff is extremely friendly and reachable all the time. Every single nurse is very good and they care & bother equally for their patients and give useful advice all the time. ",

I only noticed that it's a white and red pen kind of thing, day 2 and day 3 same pen was there along with 1 more injection not sure what was that. 4th day they bring a blue and yellow pen to give shots to me so out of curiosity I asked that injection is changed for me sister said this is your injection I told her I am not taking this daily so she went and came with another white and red pen kind of injection.she apologies to me for this and next day again she did same again I pointed her and this incident was done for 3 times. I am not sure how a hospital do this with patients. *** ***** ** *** *** ****** * *** **** **** ** *** ******* ** ********* ** ********* we spend so much of more on such a costly treatment so we expect that hospital is carrying for us more than that it affects you emotionally, failed IVF break the person. I am still not concived and I am not sure what do doctor do.",

Dr Archana, Dr Akash and team, love you guys. Thank you sounds so small for what you are doing for couples like us. \n\nFor the context, ours was a quite complicated case. My wife has a low AMH and this is our first cycle. It all sounds like a dream. If it wasn't for your meticulous planning and experienced hands, we would not have seen this day. What really mattered was the transparency from day 1, advise and detailed explanations at every step of the process. We knew and understood our chances well and you made it happen. \n\nMannat feels like a big happy family, everyone trying their level best to help people achieve life changing moments. Each one of you are so good at what you do. The always helpful and smiling people at reception, and all the nurses on ground. A big thank you to all of you. Specially, sister Rajmani, She is awesome, so committed, caring and hardworking, always with a big smile.  \n\nI know we have a long way to go but we are so much more confident under your guidance now. \n\n",

We have been taking IVF treatment at Mannat Fertility Clinic for last couple of months and today it turned out to be positive in pregnancy test in first cycle itself. Unfortunately in tests problems are identified in both side in my wife and me, it has thrown up a challenge to DR. Archana to deal with our case, as well as to us.  Dr. Archana was cool and confident in our case and explained each and  every aspect of our treatment plan and executed successfully.  I would like to appreciate everybody here Dr. Akash, Shabia, staff and reception for their efforts and I'm thankful to all of them. Everytime we step in they greet us with smile and we impressed a lot with their attitude which was a big miss in well know hospitals that we had been to earlier. The most important thing is, it costed us less compared to other hospitals, guys believe me it costed me an arm and a leg in other hospitals just for tests itself. At Mannat, with experienced doctors and low cost, it is like killing two birds with one stone. Our 9mon journey just started today, I believe our 5yrs restless journey filled with emotions, tests and counting on ovulation days will end with a little one soon, A big thanks to Manat looking forward for your continuous support for rest of the  journey.\n\n\n",

I have low amh and I was worried, I saw other doctor first who left the decision on us whether to go for IUI or try naturally. However, this doctor instantly told us that we should not wait as if the amh goes even lower then no one will be able to do anything. She also said that trying naturally would not be a problem but it would be in our best interest to speed up things a little. She also created a plan for me as in 2 cycles of IUI followed by IVF. Best thing about them is that they do Day 2 or Day 1 scan and in my case they found out a cyst on Day 2 scan which led to cancellation of the entire IUI cycle that month. If I would have listened to other doctor, I would have taken clomid for first few days and then would have come for Day 9 scan and by that time that cyst would have become worse because of Clomid. So, they helped us not only in getting IUI done, the entire process was very systematic, all side effects were taken care of, pre natal vitamins were prescribed well in advance. One can be very confident if they are seeing Dr.Archana Agarwal. ",

Dr. Archana Agarwal and Dr. Trina do not start the discussion with \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d but with \u201cYou should be enjoying life out in the world.\u201d \u201cMedication is for support but you need to change the lifestyle all along\u201d. That gave me a positive kick in the first ten seconds.Dietician Ms. Neeti didn't give the diet plan directly but focussed on my daily routine for the entire day and offered a custom diet plan.Lastly, the staff isn't just doing their medical support and admin job but as friends and offering smiles to ease you out. This is definitely their personal choice.\ud83d\ude0aThank you, everyone.",

Some other junior doctor at Manthan clinic attended to the patient, even though Dr. Agarwal was available on the floor. The junior doctor insisted on taking unnecessary tests at clinic immediately for a small health issue, though the patient was hesitant and conveyed the same to the doctor. The test was conducted infront  of 3 or 4 nurses, patient felt very uncomfortable and clinic was not sensitive to patient's privacy. The test reports took 5 days, but free consultation on reports are only available for two days post first checkup. Even the reports results were questionable, as tests reported abnormal parameters. \nAdding another small detail not related to diagnosis. Clinic had asked for Aadhar card copy, not sure why it was required for general checkup. Also, the patient form requested information on race and caste, not sure why the information is relevent for doctor checkup.",

Archana mam is so calm and listened to our concerns n understand our problem. My treatment started but the first IVF got unsuccessful. Archana mam is like motherly figure, she consoled me just like my mother and promised me next time it will be success. And here it is, we are pregnant, in the 2nd attempt. The whole hospital staff is very supportive and caring. Have to mention Minakshi mam, Rajamani Sis n Lincy Sis, they all are very very caring and cares like sisters. Front desk staff Sabina, Tabi n Aruna were very cordial and supportive in all our paper works. All the hospital staff were just a phone call away, always ready to listen and help. I must say as the name Mannat, ur Mannat will also fulfill here. We surely recommend to come here.",

But need to have a patience to conceive. we waited for 4 cycles to get the results and it finally happened when we took a break and stopped medicines for a month. so, peace of mind plus trust on the treatment is the key. The more we stress and think about conceiving, the more it will get delayed.I recommend the doctor to get positive results , but don't rush on the treatment and patiently wait for 3 to 6 cycles to get results. Few Lucky people get success on their first or second cycle itself, so don't compare yourself with them and stress your mind, just understand that everyone's body is different and everyone's response is different to medications, same medicine that works for your friend need not produce results for you. So , have patience, have trust in your doctor, don't get stressed and keep in mind that conceiving is a part of life but it is not the only thing in life.",

She has been so kind compassionate and caring, giving so much time on consultation is rare these days..Under her guidance, medication and follow ups we went with IVF. And to our surprise, I conceived in my first cycle And happily Pregnant :) Cannot ask more...My journey towards motherhood have been such smooth supportive and Specially the immense Care taken by all the sisters, special thanks to Sister Rajmani. Mannat is true to its name...Our prayers are listened! ",
