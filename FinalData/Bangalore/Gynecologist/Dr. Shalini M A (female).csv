,,0,0,YES,"Shalini ma'am was nothing short of a friend through our entire journey towards being parents. 

She was patient, cooperative and helpful through out. No matter what time we reached out to her, she always made sure to answer. We underwent IUI and she explained everything in detail and with such an ease, that we never felt any hesitation. She was always around. And the best part, she was always upfront about everything, which was refreshing and reassuring.

Her treatment made us proud parents of a beautiful baby boy. I do owe it to her for all her efforts and patience. She has been nothing short of a miracle for us. 

Thank you ma'am for everything you did for us and thank you for being there with us, throughout the journey. ",2023-12-22 05:39:49,False,True,Monika,,,
