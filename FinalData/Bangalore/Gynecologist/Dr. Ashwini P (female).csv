"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care, Prenatal Care,Child Birth Education,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Ashwini was our doctor right from pregnancy detection to delivery and postnatal care. With complications of fetal anaemia in 32nd week and risk of preterm delivery, she supported us right through to deliver a healthy girl baby in the 38th week. The doctor till the last minute was trying for Normal Vaginal Delivery, but due to multiple complications we had to opt for C-Section. 

She is very positive and takes genuine interest in the patient. All through the pregnancy she was accessible to me from answering silly questions to allaying fears over procedures such as FBT (in our case) over phone. She even went the extra mile in following-up with me about results of ultrasounds after week 34 and fetal movement monitoring whenever we were in doubt. 

Each of my counselling with her, she encouraged me and made me feel completely comfortable. She devotes a lot of time for her sessions and hence long wait times might be expected. She is also accessible at the Sthree and Shishu clinic which was closer to our house.
