We had a doubt if we can consume saffron during pregnancy to have a fair baby, doctor said if you like the taste, go ahead else it doesn't make any difference. To be on a safer side, I didn't allowed my wife to consume the saffron, and we are now blessed with a fair baby)\r\n\r\nThe delivery was normal only because of the this Doctor, we all gave up because my wife could not bear the pain, but till last minute doctor was keeping us motivated by saying that my wife is progressing well and can deliver baby soon. Though it was a tough time during the labor pain, all the pain did not go in vain and finally my wife delivered a baby with a normal procedure.\r\n\r\n",

She is patient with all and takes as much time as necessary to answer all questions. I had visited her first time almost 13 years ago as a teenager due to irregular periods. After doing all tests she assured me I have no issue and sure enough, I didn't have any issue with conception after marriage even though my periods are very irregular. She is truly an expert and is flexible to get our lab tests done at any clinic. Usually doctors will have tie ups with certain clinics but not dear Dr Annamma. We also met another couple who said she didn't charge them beyond the first consultation (they we're in their second trimester we met them). Very dedicated and expert doctor. Don't bother about the negative reviews- they are very biased for sure.",

We had a doubt if we can consume saffron during pregnancy to have a fair baby, doctor said if you like the taste, go ahead else it doesn't make any difference. To be on a safer side, I didn't allowed my wife to consume the saffron, and we are now blessed with a fair baby)\r\n\r\nThe delivery was normal only because of the this Doctor, we all gave up because my wife could not bear the pain, but till last minute doctor was keeping us motivated by saying that my wife is progressing well and can deliver baby soon. Though it was a tough time during the labor pain, all the pain did not go in vain and finally my wife delivered a baby with a normal procedure.\r\n\r\n",

After doing all tests she assured me I have no issue and sure enough, I didn't have any issue with conception after marriage even though my periods are very irregular. She is truly an expert and is flexible to get our lab tests done at any clinic. Usually doctors will have tie ups with certain clinics but not dear Dr Annamma. We also met another couple who said she didn't charge them beyond the first consultation (they we're in their second trimester we met them). Very dedicated and expert doctor. Don't bother about the negative reviews- they are very biased for sure.",

I had to wait an hour to see her. But I had no choice for there were other patients who had tokens before me, and come from various parts of the country.  Others waited as well. However every patient who came out of her chamber after the consultation, seemed to be radiating with satisfaction, joy and blessed. No one thought their wait was in vain.  While waiting I spoke to others who were waiting and asked  them why they were coming here inspite of the wait. The unanimous answer was that this doctor is more sympathetic and understanding than any other person or doctor. Several patients had come for second opinion including myself. Dr Annamma was very upfront and clearly indicated that her choice of delivery will always be a normal delivery. After my consultations I never minded the wait as I had found an Angel, whose tender loving hands mixed with love and sympathy, I had never seen  or experienced before.  For me, my family and friends there cannot be another doctor for Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  Thank You Maam.",

Right from the time we met her till the time we got pregnant  every second she lifted us up emotionally and mentally. Usually the doctors write medicines at  every meet during any treatment but she supported me both mentally and at physical level with good normal medications. With normal medications she told me that I will get pregnant at that time when my inner-self was totally in dilemma regarding my pregnancy. She was very polite and calm during our every meeting to her. She listened very carefully our every concern regarding pregnancy. We wish that every Gynecologist should learn from her that how to deal with the person who comes in hope of good treatment. Now we have two year old baby and its all because we got Dr Annamma Thomas as doctor. Best of luck to her...",
