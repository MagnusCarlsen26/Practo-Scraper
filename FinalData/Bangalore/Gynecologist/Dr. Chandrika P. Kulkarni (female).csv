In fact, it was on our insistence that we even went for the only IUI cycle that we did. Even during this one IUI cycle that we underwent, she took into consideration our inhibitions of taking hormone injections and modified the procedure accordingly. She treated our health issues with minimum medication. We conceived naturally after trying for just 2 months. She is a fantastic doctor, always available on-call to help us out with our queries.

In this digital world i was under the impression that people are comfortable but your app made me disappointed. Doc was not available today and i had to travel 2 hrs to reach clinic. With so much of pain I was desperate to meet doc but in vain.

Moreover the hospital receptionist says that they aren't even aware of the appointment being booked. It's very disheartening. Pl don't hurt patients who are already suffering with pain.
