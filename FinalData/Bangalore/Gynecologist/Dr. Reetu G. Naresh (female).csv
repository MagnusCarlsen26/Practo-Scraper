None,None,0,0,YES,"I had been visiting many Gynec Dr in Bangalore for the past 2 years as I had non stop hip and stomach pain.  Finally I met Dr.Reetu G Naresh in Apollo. She did all her diagonosis and did few tests and nailed the issue. Since i had polyps in my uterus, i was having pain n later on spotting. Few days ago I had Hysteroectomy and I have recovered in a week. Today I went for a review and Dr confirmed that I am perfectly recovering n have no aches. I am very sensitive to pain n I m happily writing this review as I have recovered from all pain n aches.

I am in my late 20s and do not wish to have children, nor do I need to be berated for my choices. The experience would've been better had the discussion been purely medical, with an explanation of the procedure being performed and it's reason. I understand with the volume of patients this may not be possible, but the energy used to provide an assessment of my life could've been spent in an explanation of the procedure.",2021-12-13 09:20:38,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
