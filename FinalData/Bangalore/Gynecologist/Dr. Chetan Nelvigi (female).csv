"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy care and management,Pregnancy,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Chetan K. Nelivigi at Rainbow Childrens Hospital, Bannerghatta Road, at the onset of my 2nd pregnancy in April 2020. My first pregnancy in 2015 involved several complications including IHCP (raised liver enzymes), IUGR (intrauterine growth retardation) in baby, leaking amniotic fluid etc. I required an emergency LSCS at 36 weeks, and had internal bleeding post-delivery because of which I required a 2nd surgery on the same day. This past history, in addition to the pandemic situation, kept me worried and I was skeptical about the hospital and the doctor in the beginning. Dr. Chetan, however, earned my trust with time. In the hindsight, I realize that choosing her was one of my best decisions ever.

1. I recommend Dr. Chetan as the 'go-to person' for high risk pregnancies. She is cautious. On day 1 itself, I saw her studying my previous case history with great interest and taking meticulous notes. Throughout the pregnancy, she took proactive measures (timely tests and supplements) to ensure that things didn't go haywire this time. 
2. She takes time to talk to the patient about the progress of the treatment. Whenever I faced any minor or major issue (say, persistent constipation, cohabiting with a corona-positive patient at home, less baby movements, itching, sudden onset of severe diarrhea on the day after delivery), she offered assurance, lifestyle and diet management advice, and medical intervention if the situation demanded so. None of my worries or queries were ever dismissed without sufficient discussion. Her attentive, caring attitude always made me feel secure and comfortable.
3. I found her very hands-on and proactive, in terms of physically examining me, or talking to the appointment desk personally to have a last-minute scan request accommodated, or talking to the radiologist about the scan conclusions, or walking to the radiology unit herself to witness the live scan, or providing direct guidance to the hospital dietician whose diet plan wasn't addressing my post-delivery diarrhea, and so on. There were 'n' number of instances throughout the course of my pregnancy when she made me feel that she was personally responsible for my complete well-being and every facet of my pregnancy.

My baby was delivered by her on Dec 2, 2020. Thanks to her, my whole experience, including delivery and post-delivery care, was extremely smooth this time. ",2021-03-11 07:24:42,False,True,Antara Kundu,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Hi,
We recently delivered our first baby (April 23) at Rainbow hospital Bannerghatta road under the guidance of Dr. Chetana Nelvigi.
After doing a lot of research on best doctors available in Bangalore (like all we wanted a normal delivery!), we had decided to go ahead and consult Dr. Chetana (good reviews and a great record for normal deliveries).
Well, it turned out to be the best decision of our life! She is very professional, authentic, and absolutely an amazing person.
Very humble and always jovial. You would never feel like you are consulting a doctor, you feel like you are having a conversation with a family member.
She makes patients really comfortable with her vibrant smile (yeah most doctors just keep a pale face ) and even lights up the hospital environment. Even in the labor room she was super cool cracking jokes and delivered our little bundle of joy with ease.
We are really fortunate to have met her. And indeed no rating is enough for her service, 100/100.
