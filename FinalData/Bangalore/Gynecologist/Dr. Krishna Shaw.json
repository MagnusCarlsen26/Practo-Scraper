I am very much satisfied with this doctors treatment and because of the trust I have in this doctor,I decided to consult her during my pregnancy period. Though I am from Kerala, my delivery wss done by Dr.Krishna Sha because of the trust I had in this doctor. She is a very experienced and sincere doctor. She explains all about the disease and treatment very well. She has time to answer to our queries and is never in a haste. The most important thing which I liked about this doctor is her calm manner. She never gives us stress nor scares us...be how serious the problem. This surely increases our confidence and positivity. I had recommended this doctor to my neighbour as well and she is also satisfied with this doctor.",
