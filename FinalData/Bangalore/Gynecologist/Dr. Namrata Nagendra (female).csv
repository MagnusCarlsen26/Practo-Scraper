"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"I had the privilege of being under the care of Dr. Namrata during my pregnancy and my journey with PCOS, and I can't praise her enough for the incredible support and expertise she provided.

In a world where the 'C' in C-section seems to stand for ""common,"" Dr. Namrata champions the 'N' in normal delivery with gusto.

My adventures in pregnancy began early on when I had bleeding episodes and contracted COVID during the 14th week of my pregnancy. Dr Namrata was not only my medical guide but also a pillar of support throughout this trying period.

One of the standout aspects of Dr. Namrata's care was her holistic approach to pregnancy. She encouraged me to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which included prenatal yoga and even recommended a Yoga Guru. This recommendation not only helped me maintain an optimal weight but also kept me active and energised throughout my pregnancy. Her guidance in this regard contributed significantly to my overall well-being and made the journey to motherhood more enjoyable.

The luxury of time she offers her patients is something I really appreciate. Appointments were never rushed; she never hesitated to dedicate ample time to explain, clarify, and address all of our concerns - no matter how trivial they may have seemed.
This is true for her appointments as well as queries on Whatsapp; she was always just a message away on WhatsApp, promptly addressing any doubts or concerns I had. This accessibility and her willingness to engage in open and clear communication gave me peace of mind throughout my pregnancy.

Though, I am one to get myself tested for every little thing, the doctor doesn't believe in overmedication or unnecessary tests and has a minimalist approach. 
She's not one to prescribe a pharmacy-worth of pills or send you on a wild goose chase for endless tests/scans.

Additionally, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my pregnancy. Instead of rushing to medication, Dr. Namrata encouraged me to manage it through diet and exercise, again emphasising the importance of a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy.

Then came the moment when my mucus plug decided it had better places to be at 35 weeks, and the prospect of a preterm delivery loomed large. However, the doctor was quick to respond with a plan to delay the delivery by a week and make it as smooth as possible for both me and my baby. Thanks to her expertise and guidance, my baby did not require a stay in the NICU, and the entire childbirth experience was remarkably smooth.

I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Namrata to any expectant mother looking for a compassionate and knowledgeable gynaecologist who values the importance of natural childbirth. 
She's simply fantastic at what she does, and her results speak for themselves. No need for over-the-top praise, just heartfelt gratitude for a skilled, and compassionate gynaecologist who made my pregnancy journey an extraordinary one.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"I will say 100% that we made the right decision in choosing Dr.Namrata Nagendra for my second pregnancy. Under her immense care, right treatment and guidance, I delivered a baby boy successfully on Sept 25, 2022 among complications like gestational diabetes and urinary tract infection. 

I was in my native place during the conception of my second baby and was visiting local doctor for the first 4 months. At the end of 3rd month, I was diagnosed with diabetes and the local doctor gave me lots of stress and tension and totally demotivated me. That's when I started consulting Namrata doctor through video call. I chose the doctor purely based on the reviews and hence was bit skeptical. But starting from the first call, I liked the way doctor handled my situation and gave me the confidence to face it. I came back to Bangalore in 5th month and started visiting her in-person and that's when I got my peace of mind back. It was a big stress relief for me and I started enjoying my pregnancy. Under her guidance and along with yoga and diet control, I switched from insulin to tablet and then stopped tablet also, all in a span of 2.5 months. If we get diabetes, most doctors say that we need to take insulin or tablet till the end of the pregnancy or even post that. The local doctor also said the same. But I wanted to bring my sugar levels under control without any medication and the local doctor did not support me at all. She did not even listen to me. But Namrata doctor supported me, gave me the right guidance and helped me to stop medication and that was a big stress relief for me. Thank you very much Doctor!

Another stress factor was urinary tract infection in my 4th month. The local doctor asked me to take injection for 5 days but Namrata doctor asked me to stop it immediately because it was a powerful dose and could harm the baby. She gave me a low dose tablet and the infection got cured. She also stopped bunch of other tablets that I was taking as given by the local doctor. Namrata doctor gives minimum tablets and also of low dosage and also suggests minimal tests and scans. 

Most doctors don't spend time with patients in listening to our concerns or worries. But Namrata doctor listens to patients concerns and worries and gives motivation, encouragement and positivity to handle the situation. At the same time, she is transparent in explaining the problem also and doesn't hide anything from us. 

I wanted to try VBAC since my first delivery was c-section. Doctor was very supportive for that as well and explained me the criteria for it. But since my scar thickness was very thin, I wasn't able to try for normal and delivered through c-section. It was midnight 3 AM when my water broke and the baby passed motion as well inside the womb, so it was an emergent situation. Though it was night time, doctor immediately came to the hospital and successfully delivered the baby. 

Even among these complications, doctor always motivated me to be active and never suggested me to take rest. Along with yoga, my post recovery was pretty fast compared to my first one, though my age got increased by 7 years between the 2 deliveries! For my first c-section I was very tired for the first 2-3 weeks but for my second c-section, I was able to climb stairs on my 3rd day and got pretty active in the first week itself!

Overall, 3 things about the doctor stands out - patience, positivity and easily approachable. Doctor is available on watsapp and is very prompt and responsive in answering our messages. It was a very pleasant experience with the doctor and I would strongly recommend this doctor to anyone.

Review:
We are immensely grateful to Dr. Namrata for her exceptional care and support throughout my wife, Muskan's, pregnancy journey. From the very beginning, when complications arose due to fibroids and the need for cervical encirclage emerged, Dr. Namrata stepped in like a guardian angel, guiding us with her expertise and empathy.

Her compassionate approach made us feel like family rather than just patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of Muskan's condition, alleviating our concerns and ensuring we were well-informed every step of the way. Her reassuring presence gave us the strength to navigate through the challenges of a difficult pregnancy.

When it came time for Muskan's delivery, Dr. Namrata's skill and dedication were truly remarkable. She ensured that Muskan felt comfortable and empowered throughout the process, guiding her with patience and professionalism. Thanks to her expertise and unwavering support, Muskan was able to undergo a successful normal vaginal delivery, despite the initial complications.

Dr. Namrata's impact on our lives goes beyond her medical expertise. She provided not just medical care, but emotional support and encouragement when we needed it most. We are forever grateful to her for her dedication, kindness, and the precious gift of bringing our baby into this world safely.

In our eyes, Dr. Namrata is more than just a doctor; she is a blessing, a beacon of hope, and a true guardian of maternal health. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking exceptional care during their pregnancy journey. Thank you, Dr. Namrata, for everything you've done for us. You've made a profound difference in our lives, and we will always be indebted to you.",2024-03-05 19:41:55,False,True,Verified Patient,Thank you,2024-03-08T05:11:08+0000,Dr. Namrata Nagendra
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Dr Namrata is an amazing doctor and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for more during my care with her. I delivered a 3.6kg baby vaginally with her.
I am a OBGY specialist working in UK and I came to Namrata for my pregnancy and delivery. She practices the latest Uk guidelines . As this was my first pregnancy I was nervous and being a doctor, the anxiety level is a lot more.

I have worked with her before and I knew about her passion and dedication to the patients and she always makes sure they get the best outcome no mater what the case may be. 

During my pregnancy I wasn‚Äôt sure about going through a vaginal birth, but she always motivated me.   She listens to you and address all the issues without dismissing your concerns. I always felt like everything was easy and that is a rare feeling to get.

When I got into labour , she personally called the staff and doctors with instructions and would regular check on the labour progress. Once I got into active labour she was there in the hospital with me from 8pm and sacrificed her family time for which I am grateful . Having her there in the labour room during the most painful phase reassured me. I was able to just concentrate on myself without worrying about the medical stuff. At the last part of labour when I had to push, it was painful inspite of having epidural analgesia, but she  was calm yet in control of the situation. This final stage can get tough and it is easy to give up  but she kept encouraging to keep going. I still cannot believe I had a normal delivery and this is only and only because of her support .

Post delivery she had come regularly to check on me. This is the most underrated phase with probelms ranging from breastfeeding initiation, pain and aches from top to bottom , lack of sleep , baby‚Äôs jaundice issues  and the emotional roller coaster , so instead of saying everything will get back to normal she provided solutions to tackle this  phase.

 I have not only been blessed with this pregnancy but my journey with Namrata has made this the most beautiful phase. Hence as a doctor and as a patient  I strongly recommend Dr Namrata for your care.",2023-10-12 16:35:01,False,True,Amritha Nair,Thank you Amritha.. ,2023-10-13T15:47:05+0000,Dr. Namrata Nagendra

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"This is my heartfelt note for the amazing doctor I have met last year. All of it happened by chance and I am extremely fortunate that it happened. New to the Bangalore city, I read lots and lots of reviews on Practo & took a leap of faith to go with a relatively young age doctor with plethora of positive reviews and recommendations.The first thing that you will notice when you meet her is her friendly nature. In no time, you will start feeling that you are in safe hands. She takes care of her patients very well. She is always available to give suggestions(responds quickly on whatsapp, reviews reports, follows up on the diet plan, tracks sugar levels on a regular basis and what not). She is extremely practical. She gave me a clear cut guidelines that for normal delivery the weight of the baby has to be in a certain range and I should have the strength to deliver the baby. And, I should focus my efforts only towards that. It was important for me to keep a track of my weight (have a strict diet plan) and do regular exercise to ensure that my body has the stamina and capacity to handle labour pain. She helped me a lot in this. Within a few months, I realized that she has the right balance of being friendly and being strict / super strict like a mother. She plans everything in advance, encourages to read more about pregnancy and ask more questions and clear all doubts. A perfect, no-nonsense doctor who removes all the unnecessary steps and guides you with only what's important and relevant for you. She encouraged me to continue going to office till 9th month, continue with regular household work. She doesn't let you feel bad, less energetic/effective just because you are pregnant. She helped me sail through in a smooth manner. I had a normal delivery(this is what I had requested her for in my first visit :) ).I would strongly recommend her for all couples who need a doctor whom they can completely trust.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"This is my heartfelt note for the amazing doctor I have met last year. All of it happened by chance and I am extremely fortunate that it happened. New to the Bangalore city, I read lots and lots of reviews on Practo & took a leap of faith to go with a relatively young age doctor with plethora of positive reviews and recommendations.The first thing that you will notice when you meet her is her friendly nature. In no time, you will start feeling that you are in safe hands. She takes care of her patients very well. She is always available to give suggestions(responds quickly on whatsapp, reviews reports, follows up on the diet plan, tracks sugar levels on a regular basis and what not). She is extremely practical. She gave me a clear cut guidelines that for normal delivery the weight of the baby has to be in a certain range and I should have the strength to deliver the baby. And, I should focus my efforts only towards that. It was important for me to keep a track of my weight (have a strict diet plan) and do regular exercise to ensure that my body has the stamina and capacity to handle labour pain. She helped me a lot in this. Within a few months, I realized that she has the right balance of being friendly and being strict / super strict like a mother. She plans everything in advance, encourages to read more about pregnancy and ask more questions and clear all doubts. A perfect, no-nonsense doctor who removes all the unnecessary steps and guides you with only what's important and relevant for you. She encouraged me to continue going to office till 9th month, continue with regular household work. She doesn't let you feel bad, less energetic/effective just because you are pregnant. She helped me sail through in a smooth manner. I had a normal delivery(this is what I had requested her for in my first visit :) ).I would strongly recommend her for all couples who need a doctor whom they can completely trust.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Well, the full star rating and reviews here are the testimony about Dr. Namrata. As I write this review, I literally mean every word of it.

Being an outsider and first pregnancy, I was looking for a place near to me, where I can get a dedicated attention. Thanks to Google, we found Dr. Namrata. We started consulting her for the pre-pregnancy counselling and in the first visit itself, we didn't have a second thought. It was assured that we are in safe hands.  

Dr. Namrata is very confident, knowledgeable, friendly, transparent and honest. She explains everything you need to know beforehand, all pros and cons in details in simple language so that you are ready even in case of any bad situation. There won't be sugar coated advice from her just to make you feel good, but she suggests the right thing which brings fruit at a later stage. She's there throughout the pregnancy being a proper guide, focusing more on lifestyle changes rather than unnecessary medications. Following her advice, I didn't have any side symptoms like bodyache, bloating, swollen feet etc in my entire  pregnancy. She ensures that the money and time are utilised at right place, advising on the best possible solution at every step. Just book an appointment and She takes care of the rest, she makes sure that scans, blood tests, hospital etc get done at the ease. 

Dr Namrata is an angel sent by God to welcome more angels to earth hassle-free. She was constantly monitoring me throughout the labour being my rock, I owe her completely for my NVD. Just few hours after delivery, I was as fit as any normal girl. She's not a doctor, she's a friend/sister who's just a message away for any silliest queries and concerns(this is rare to find these days and this shows how personal she takes her patients and their well being). Every visit to her is like a therapy, that makes you anxiety-free. She always involved my husband in everything, which I loved personally. The fees you pay at this clinic is like a shell in the sea in this medical world, compared to the care, focus and positive vibes you get. 
Words will fall short, if I go on writing about Dr. Namrata, a highly broad-minded and non judgemental doctor.

And I must say, that turned out to be the best decision for us. We conceived the very next month of following her advice and since then, she's been nothing less than a guardian angel.In the 12th week, I was diagnosed with a short cervix during our NT scan. She took no chances and immediately proceeded with surgery while most doctors would have wanted to wait and watch. Later in the 6th month, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes which she managed calmly through diet control and minimal medication. She ensured my weight gain was minimal while making sure that my baby was growing well.Finally, she delivered our healthy baby girl and gave us the biggest gift of our lives.Her clinic is also maintained professionally with minimal wait time even on weekends. She spends quality time with her patients during consultation and answers even the silliest of doubts via WhatsApp anytime.Apart from all this which covers how good she is as a doctor, I thank her for how well she managed my shooting anxiety levels like a friend. She was very confident of doing a normal delivery for me but due to my anxiety, I wanted an elective c section which she tried convincing me against but ultimately understood that I'm too anxious to go through labour.*** *** ***** * *** ***** I recommend her to every woman who wants to meet with a friendly, non judgemental and broad minded doctor.",2022-12-07 15:02:37,False,True,AISHWARYA SIVAKUMAR,Thank youüôè,2022-12-08T08:28:53+0000,Dr. Namrata Nagendra

Your search for a gynaecologist whom you can trust, who is receptive, who will make you feel like home and who puts the interest of the patient first, ends here. 

Pregnancy is a beautiful  journey which can turn stressful in the absence of a doctor you can trust. Thanks to google and reviews of past patients, We were lucky to discover Dr Namrata while searching for a doctor to consult in our first journey as parents.

We were very impressed by Dr Namrata's philosophy which encouraged normal delivery, avoid overmedication, giving priority to what is best for the long term for the patient. We never felt there was any conflict of interest in whatever she advised us.

Dr. Namrata gave ample time in her clinic and genuinely listened to all our concerns and never looked in hurry. Beyond the clinic, she was accessible any time of day over text and felt she was not just a doctor but a counselor, a friend whom we could reach out to when ever required.

For me as father, the best part was when the D Day arrived and doctor encouraged me to be in the labor/delivery room for the entire duration which was more than 5 hours. Doctor Namrata was instrumental in ensuring we were calm during this stressful period. It was surreal to see the natural vaginal delivery and appreciate the woman body. As a father, it made me even more sensitive and appreciative of what a mother goes through. 

This privilege would not have been possible without Dr. Namrata and me and my wife will forever be grateful to her for the most precious moment of our life. 

We became parents to our son Aaroh on 28th September 2022 with the magic hands of Dr Namratha! 

We express our gratitude and whole-heartedly recommend Dr Namrata to all lovely couples looking to become parents!

She understood and communicated to us such a way that we felt assured that someone is always there with us on different stages of our pregnancy and guide us at each and every step to experience a healthy pregnancy ,

We consulted pre pregnancy and she understood our pain, guided more like a friend than Doctor in planning our second pregnancy and was with us all through the journey giving us the much needed positivity. While everything was not smooth with our second pregnancy, she constantly encouraged us to be positive and guided us with the available options. With high NT in the scan, we almost lost hope, at some point, didn't follow Dr. Namrata's suggestion but she's always there, like a friend and sister and ensured that we're trying all the possible options before giving up. With such care and knowledge that she carries, my pregnancy went so smooth that I didn't even feel pregnant all through nine months; I trusted and followed her all through pregnancy, including diet and yoga asans, resulting a smooth nine months and happy delivery of baby girl. Doc is available 24*7 for our questions and promptly followed up with me on how I was doing all through pregnancy. Dr. Namrata is the next best thing happened to us after our baby during this pregnancy. From friends and family saying Normal delivery may not be possible to delivering our little princess through natural labour, my baby girl is both God and Dr. Namrata's gift to us. 

I recommend Dr. Namrata more than 100%. If you're looking for a Gynaec, look no further, she's the best you could consult in Bangalore; no unwanted medicines or scans, just what is right for you and your health profile.

Thankful to have her as my obgyn!

We moved to Bangalore during the 6th month of my pregnancy and I was searching for an obgyn. I found Dr. Namrata on Practo and based on positive reviews I decided to have a video consultation. At first I was hesitant and doubtful as I was going to her purely based on online reviews.

That changed over the remaining course of my pregnancy as she was very good in communicating with me and was clearly explaining/reasoning things. She allowed my husband to join during in-person consultations at her clinic (following covid safety protocols). During appointments, she gave us ample time to consult, answered all our queries and never rushed us. She gave me good advice on prenatal diet and exercise routines. The part that I appreciate the most was her availability on WhatsApp and her quick responses (for simple questions I had at random times).

She was straightforward in communicating potential risks at different stages of the pregnancy. She was also receptive to our opinions and reasoned with us for what would be best for me and my baby. I delivered exactly at 40 weeks. I didn't get natural labor pain and I wanted to wait, but she explained clearly the risks of waiting beyond 40 weeks and convinced me that going for induced labor pain was the right thing to do. Her motto for delivery was ""Healthy mom, healthy baby"".

From my first appointment, I was clear that I wanted to try for a normal delivery and she was supportive of it. During delivery, I had an episiotomy but I also had an uncontrolled tear which led to significant blood loss. I'm thankful for Dr. Namrata and her labor room team to quickly identify the tear, take corrective actions and prevent further complications.

Every time we sat with her for consultation,  she cleared all our doubts and my unnecessary stressors. The pregnancy progressed smoothly under her care. Even the exercises and diet prescribed by her helped me in controlling my weight and gestational diabetes. Any doubt i had, maam would clear in WhatsApp messages. She insisted that husband should be in the labour room which is what I have always wanted. Moreover I wanted a normal delivery.  Namrata maam was sure to make it happen. My husband was more confident and ready to be with me in the labour room after all the classes taken by Namrata maam. He and maam gave me the boost throughout the delivery without epidural. Towards the end,  head was not positioned properly and cord  was round the neck.  But Namrata maam was super confident that she got the baby out once fully dialated. We are blessed with a normal healthy baby girl and NICU was not required. Everything happened as per God's grace and because of Namrata maam' s expertise.

My pregnancy went on so smoothly with no hiccups and she ensured that I got my tests done in a timely manner so everything could be kept at bay.

* Sheer Professional with touch of empathy and compassion. 
* Throughout Support during pregnancy till delivery and beyond.
* Doctor was Focused on normal vaginal delivery from the starting, 1st trimester, and we finally achieved it on 6th December 2020. I think Even if complications would've arrived, I'm sure we would've tackled it with Dr. Namrata by our side. 
* Followed everything that Doctor advised and it helped us a lot. 
* Patience that doctor kept during delivery is appreciated not only by us but within my circle of friends and family. 
* Doctor was keen on Normal delivery whereas my wife had given up due to labor pain and was asking for c-section delivery. Doctor had belief on the data i.e heartbeats of baby within womb and blood pressure of my wife, which were monitored throughout the labor and were perfectly normal.
* Doctor's words were very encouraging during this time and my wife was convinced for normal delivery. We delivered a healthy baby boy!! Jyoti is recovering well too!! 

* To be very honest, we have not seen any doctor like Dr. Namrata Nagendra. 

May be some of the words above are coming out of over joy but we achieved this joy because we followed doctor and doctor followed us at every step. The synchronisation between us was phenomenal which came because of the cognitive empathy that Doctor possess.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,I got pregnant during lockdown period. We found very difficult to find any gynecologist during that pandemic period. Then one of my close friend refer Dr. Namrata Nagendra's name. She was very friendly at the time of very first call and asked me to come to Mommy & Me Clinic. We got instant relief after meeting her as she was very friendly and explained everything in detail. I was more than 100Kg that time and she was the person who gave me confidence that it could be a healthy pregnancy if I could maintain proper diet. She broke the myth that during pregnancy one has to gain weight and can not lose weight. I started following her diet plan and lost almont 5 Kg within 3 months. Throughout my whole pregnancy she strictly maintained my weight. That was why I had a pregnancy without any complication. It was she who gave me confidence that I can have normal delivery. It was just out of my imagination that I can try for normal delivery. But her every word motivated me so much that I was mentally prepared for normal delivery by my 3rd trimester with the help of proper diet and exercise. Then my delivery day came. I was in labour throughout the night. She replied to my massage even at 1am during my labour. Again she visited to see me at 5am in the morning. And when delivery time has arrived she again came at 6:30am. Because of her warmth I felt that she was like my mother. Finally with my utter surprise I had a normal delivery and gave birth of a healthy baby boy. Even from the very next day she made me walk and climb stairs as well.

Have you ever seen films where the gynaecologist sits while holding the mothers hand lovingly in the delivery room and says PUSH‚Ä¶.. ?! Thats exactly what happened to me. 
I chose Dr. Namrata after reading her reviews. I went to her with Diabetes , yet she did not discourage me to get pregnant. We worked as a team and got the sugar readings under control. I followed whatever she said to the T and in exactly 20 days, I had conceived. Yes, it was that easy only because we had complete faith in her. The moment the pregnancy was confirmed, she said ‚ÄòYour Next 9 months are mine‚Äô. 
It was a high risk pregnancy with high sugar readings, not the best of BMI and yes Covid- which drained me emotionally- doctor was just a message away. 
Not many women of my age prefers vaginal delivery - for the obvious reasons. But I strictly wanted a Vaginal Delivery. Dr. Namrata‚Äôs Track record says that she promotes Vaginal birth. She mentally prepared me, made me do pre - natal yoga(Mommy and Me has certified Pre Natal classes- I highly recommend Yogini Meenakshi ji), encouraged me to walk, have quality time with my husband( she asked us to hold hands and go for evening walks :) ). The entire pregnancy I had gained only 9 kgs.Thats how strict Doctor is! :)

When my water broke, from then till my delivery which is 22 HOURS of labour, Dr Namrata was right next to me, holding my hands, waiting for the cervix to dilate. You would only see it in movies!  I told her to fulfil my dream of a vaginal delivery and SHE DID IT.
She was the first who got to know I was pregnant, she was the first to make me hear the heartbeat, she was the first to hold my baby,She is equally a mother to my daughter and that, for any mother is a very big thing to say.I was discharged on a Sunday and the next day I was washing clothes. Thats how smooth my Pregnancy was.

Vaginal Delivery- I knew I would do it, but I didn‚Äôt know I COULD do it.-

I consulted with Dr. Namrata for my pregnancy right from the time I took a home pregnancy test, through my delivery and post natal care as well. It felt like she was part of this whole journey with me like a family member, because I met with her every two weeks, consulted over phone for even the smallest of doubts and she would patiently address everything. She takes her time with patients and not once will you feel like your time is up, she will go through all your questions and concerns and calmly address everything. She‚Äôs superbly up to date with practices, trends and behaviours and somehow always knows what to do. 

I went in with borderline sugar, blood pressure and thyroid issues which she tackled through the course of the pregnancy making sure my body is ready and capable enough to deliver normally when the time came. Finally, in the labour room, she was perhaps the only one confident on a normal delivery when even I had given up because of the contractions and the way my labour progressed. 

With Dr. Namrata, you get a doctor, diet consultant, advice from a mother and a friend all in one. She also never dispenses with prescriptions for medication unless absolutely necessary and never makes you get unnecessary tests or make lab visits if not needed - I think I went through only 2 or 3 Dolos through the whole course of the pregnancy besides my vitamin top ups. If there is a better way to deal with your health issues such as through exercise, yoga or diet, she will herself guide you and help you find a plan that works for you. She senses your state of mind, your motivation to do or not do certain things and can talk to you at that wavelength. I continue to consult with her for post-natal care and will continue to for all my regular gynaec consultations - I have been extremely extremely lucky to find an obstetrician like her during my pregnancy and I would blindly recommend her to anyone looking for Gynaec or obstetric consultation for what ever issues small or big. Especially during these COVID times, it was an absolute blessing to have a doctor like her by my side.

Her holistic approach to care ensures well rounded outcomes. Speaking specifically about pregnancy and childbirth experience, Dr Namrata not only gave medical advice but also encouraged us to adopt healthy physical AND mental lifestyles. She‚Äôs also one of the few Doctors who understands and appreciates the power of counselling. A detailed counselling session ahead of childbirth on postpartum blues and depression was extremely helpful. I wish more medical professionals dabbled with the mental wellbeing aspects like she does.

All in all, as you can tell from all the other raving reviews here, she‚Äôs excellent at what she does. Trust her to provide the best possible care for you and you‚Äôll go back healed in more ways than one.

Like this there are many things to share. Dr. Namrata managed every new challenge of my pregnancy (my age, gestational diabetes etc) so well. 
On the whole..  I would say.. she is a very dedicated gynecologist with modern outlook and  who also believes in traditional ways to carry through the pregnancy and delivery. Dr. Namrata spends great amount of time with patients and explains each and every information meticulously. She is a very friendly, supportive and approachable doctor. 
One rarely gets such experiences. Doctors like Dr. Namrata matters a lot especially when journey is not so smooth. 
I would strongly suggest Dr. Namrata. It was the most memorable time. Thank you Dr. Namrata.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Namrata Nagendra is an expert Obstetrician/Gynecologist with a caring and friendly nature. She is full of energy and keeps herself available over a call/WhatsApp to advice/answer any query.

She is very clear in her communication and keeps the expecting mother well informed. She prefers to prescribe very less medicine and limited number of scans, unless absolutely required. She knows the subject very well, so her treatment steps are well planned. We luckily got in touch with her from the pre-pregnancy/planning days, and then on never had a second thought. 
Planning, Pregnancy, Delivery and Post Delivery is a journey, we are happy to have her by our side as a caregiver. We were blessed with a baby girl in July 2022 perfectly fine and healthy.

We were excited and determined to have NVD, but our first consulting doctor scared us that it was a high-risk pregnancy. As it was unsettling, we started looking for a second opinion, thankfully we landed at Mommy and Me Clinic after reading about Dr.Namrata Nagendra.

She is not only a Doctor, but for me, she has been a constant source of positivity and care throughout the journey. All my myths and dreads vanished during our visit to her, though I was obese she gave me the confidence to have a normal delivery. She set goals for me during each review in terms of diet, maintenance weight, and exercise for me to maintain a healthy and low-risk pregnancy. 
Her approach was always humble, and her recommendations for scans and medicines are effectively planned. We were educated about each and every scan, and method involved during the delivery process. She is easily reachable on WhatsApp for any query and all the concerns are addressed swiftly. 
She was there with me from the first pain of labor, until I delivered after 24 hours of labor. We can't express how grateful we are to Dr.Namarata for the normal delivery of our baby girl!
Our journey with her became more beautiful and comfortable.
We highly recommend her for people leaving in B'lore, for all the gynecological issues, pregnancy, childbirth, and especially NVD. Thank you, Doc!

Throughout the three trimesters (9 months), Dr Namrata ensured we are equipped with all the required information on pregnancy and child birth.

I had a normal delivery but a tough one, with more than 7 hours in labour, tired and on the verge of losing hope of a normal delivery it was Dr Namrata who pushed me to not give up, she ensured I keep trying as she believed I could do it. Today I‚Äôm a proud parent & I thank Dr Namrata for believing in me and guiding me through a healthy pregnancy and child birth process.

We were really scared and upset about our situation, that is when a common friend referred us to Dr Namrata, after consulting her, for the first time, we felt really happy and at piece, she cared and listened to us and provided us with the right guidance, it was always an inclusive conversation with her, we never felt rushed to make any decision. 

She always explains all the pros and cons so that we could make an informed decision, sometimes she corrected us if she felt we are making a bad decision. 

My wife also had gestational diabetes, the way she followed up through whatsapp and provided guidance was really heart-warming, she also reviewed our reports on whatsapp and provided guidance.

She was always there for our queries, and she was very responsive. 

When ever we went to her clinic the max we had waited for is 10-15 min.

We faced number of issues during our entire pregnency including short cervial lenght, complete bed rest from 4th month onwards, gestational diabetes, difference between baby weights (30%), reduced amniotic fluid for one baby, low birth weight (1.5 KG) for one of the babies and many more.
