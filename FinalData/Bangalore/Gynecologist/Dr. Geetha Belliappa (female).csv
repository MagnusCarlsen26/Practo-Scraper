"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Highly recommended! I've met a few OB-GYNs over the last few months, and had given up on finding a doctor who is enthusiastic, positive, friendly and helpful until I met Dr. Geetha Belliappa. Generous with her time, be it during consultations or over phone, she is always available for her patients, to clarify any doubts or to reassure them. 

While most doctors don't bother answering the questions of patients or brush it away as nothing because ""they've heard the same questions many times already"", Dr. Belliappa takes the time to explain everything because she understands that a pregnancy is a new and unique experience to each new mom. If you're someone who can't help researching an overdose of pregnancy information, consult with Dr. Belliappa because she'll guide you through every query of yours.",2020-04-06 06:54:27,False,True,Preeti,,,
