More than a doctor, she is a mother and a human being. We always feel relieved consulting her at our most challenging times.\n\nWe get to know about her from a friend's recommendation and after spending a couple of years consulting doctors in eminent hospitals in Bengaluru we have realized that we need special attention and a doctor who has time to let us speak and understand our problems and we are grateful to meet Kavitha Ma'am at that point.\n\nIt's been already a couple of years since we are in continuous touch with Kavitha Ma'am for different complications. She is quite calm and an easy to approachable doctor. \n\nFew scenarios which have kept this bond strong:\n1. Due to my wife's criticality Ma'am was never hesitant to share her contact number to reach her during emergencies and she responds\n2. Once before an OT, my wife was facing some difficulty with a medicine, informing the sisters on duty didn't help and I need to call Ma'am directly and she get the situation controlled immediately\n3. At one point, we were clueless about the next steps and surrendered to her on our circumstances, the conversation ended in her consultation cabin with all three of us (Ma'am, my wife, and me) crying about the situation\n4. There was a certain requirement of immediate hospitalization at late night, I never thought Ma'am will come at that time to see my wife. There were some tough calls that have to take at that point, and I could see how helpless she was feeling for us. On the very next day, she was there with my wife almost all the time.\n\nWe are really grateful throughout our life for Kavitha Ma'am's contribution.  We wish her all the best.",

She's known for her expertise, calmness, patience and so on.\nWe came across Dr. Kavitha Pujar based on reviews/ testimonies in google and practo while in search for a good Gynec.\nWe visited her couple of years ago when we were trying to conceive and was diagnosed for PCOD. Frankly, our first visit itself was promising.\n\nLikes:\n- Her calm nature spreads a positive vibe. Feels like surrounded\nby her aura.\n- She listens to us very patiently which makes us even more\ncomfortable and explains well about concern and treatments.\n- No false promises, just 100% facts.\n- No pressure being put on patients, irrespective of any situation.\n- Her method of treatment is something unseen in this market, but just serves what we need.\n- Very impressed by her pace of treatment, medication methods,\nand more important is her tailor made treatments.\n- She provides what we 'NEED' more than what we 'WANT'.\n\nDislikes: Unable to find one.\n\nHaving said that, moral of the story is, we are PREGNANT now naturally :) :) What more can one ask for.\n\nShe had taken equal effort by her treatments as a professional and supported us so far.\nWould continue to be under her guidance throughout our pregnancy journey too.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for good Gynec.\n\n- Monisha Nilukshi, Joseph Hecto",

More than a doctor, she is a mother and a human being. We always feel relieved consulting her at our most challenging times.\n\nWe get to know about her from a friend's recommendation and after spending a couple of years consulting doctors in eminent hospitals in Bengaluru we have realized that we need special attention and a doctor who has time to let us speak and understand our problems and we are grateful to meet Kavitha Ma'am at that point.\n\nIt's been already a couple of years since we are in continuous touch with Kavitha Ma'am for different complications. She is quite calm and an easy to approachable doctor. \n\nFew scenarios which have kept this bond strong:\n1. Due to my wife's criticality Ma'am was never hesitant to share her contact number to reach her during emergencies and she responds\n2. Once before an OT, my wife was facing some difficulty with a medicine, informing the sisters on duty didn't help and I need to call Ma'am directly and she get the situation controlled immediately\n3. At one point, we were clueless about the next steps and surrendered to her on our circumstances, the conversation ended in her consultation cabin with all three of us (Ma'am, my wife, and me) crying about the situation\n4. There was a certain requirement of immediate hospitalization at late night, I never thought Ma'am will come at that time to see my wife. There were some tough calls that have to take at that point, and I could see how helpless she was feeling for us. On the very next day, she was there with my wife almost all the time.\n\nWe are really grateful throughout our life for Kavitha Ma'am's contribution.  We wish her all the best.",

She's known for her expertise, calmness, patience and so on.\nWe came across Dr. Kavitha Pujar based on reviews/ testimonies in google and practo while in search for a good Gynec.\nWe visited her couple of years ago when we were trying to conceive and was diagnosed for PCOD. Frankly, our first visit itself was promising.\n\nLikes:\n- Her calm nature spreads a positive vibe. Feels like surrounded\nby her aura.\n- She listens to us very patiently which makes us even more\ncomfortable and explains well about concern and treatments.\n- No false promises, just 100% facts.\n- No pressure being put on patients, irrespective of any situation.\n- Her method of treatment is something unseen in this market, but just serves what we need.\n- Very impressed by her pace of treatment, medication methods,\nand more important is her tailor made treatments.\n- She provides what we 'NEED' more than what we 'WANT'.\n\nDislikes: Unable to find one.\n\nHaving said that, moral of the story is, we are PREGNANT now naturally :) :) What more can one ask for.\n\nShe had taken equal effort by her treatments as a professional and supported us so far.\nWould continue to be under her guidance throughout our pregnancy journey too.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for good Gynec.\n\n- Monisha Nilukshi, Joseph Hecto",
