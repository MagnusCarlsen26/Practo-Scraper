Dr.Kavitha has given good inputs and suggestions, she has been amazing,  very kind, professional, caring, friendly, thoughtful, compassionate and cheerful. At the Sai Speciality Clinic, Kasthuri Nagar everyone I have ever dealt with from the support staff to the doctor made me feel so at ease and has been pleasant and helpful. Dr.Kavitha and her nurses were absolutely fantastic , attentive, respectful, caring, and personable attitudes made me look forward to my appointments. I feel blessed that Dr.kavitha took such wonderful care of me with both pregnancies and was the person to bring my girl and boy into this world. It was truly an honor to call Dr.kavitha as my doctor and to have her share in our special memories in our lives. As we know this time the whole world is dealing with covid 19 and we need such types of doctors. We got our second child(baby boy) delivered in Cloudnine Hospital, Horamavu recently and the kind of service the hospital had provided is really commendable. My experience during my delivery period was awesome . I would highly recommend considering Cloudnine hospital for delivery and post natal care and of course Dr.Kavitha for Consultation. Thank you so much Doctor for your help in making my pregnancy and delivery a wonderful, happy, and loving experience.",

I delivered a baby boy on 10.3.2022 after 7 yrs of married life. I had PCOS issue which was well treated by Dr and finally I conceived within 1 month of consulting her. \n\nThen the major problem started which is hypertension, Dr took utmost care of me as if I was her sister. She was always available on watsapp/ call to clear my queries at any given point of time. \n\nShe will never scare you or never leave you with a question mark, she would explain everything in detail which makes us feel relaxed. She will never prescribe unwanted tests or medicines. \n\nAt 1 given point in time, we had to take decision to deliver the baby in 34+ weeks. The way my guardian angel dealt was phenomenal! She gave us time to decide and never rushed for a immediate decision, assured us that baby and me would be fine without any complications. \n\nShe is such a dedicated lady who came early in the morning at 5, just to handle my case! She came with a bright smile and told me to relax everything will be fine! 5.16am my bundle of joy came out to this world! What a joyous moment it was!\n\nAll thanks to my dear Dr. Kavitha Lakshmi.\n\nI'm completely happy with her and her treatment and would refer to my family/ friends.\n\nWe love you loads guardian angel!\n\nRegards,\nVikram, Thabitha and Dudu",

I have always felt Ma'am very friendly during our visits and gives the motherly touch to advice on things to be followed. She even helped to choose the best options for delivery and on my delivery day tried so much for Normal delivery. But since the labour couldn't progress we had to go for emergency C-section keeping the safety of me n Baby in mind. \n\nVery Happy that she gave all the care and attention during pregnancy and post delivery n follow-up consultation too.

She is so systematic with her work and does not let even the smallest doubt remain in us. She has been available and approachable at any point of time. In the 35th week of pregnancy, all of a sudden when the baby weight seemed to be a little high, the words she told me were: \"Every baby is unique..some babies are born chubby..we do not have the right to alter that and therefore please continue your usual diet and follow the routine exercises. Do not try to control the baby's weight by eating less. The mother needs to be fit\". These words instilled so much confidence in me. July 1st was the expected due date and doctor asked me to get admitted on the 30th of June if labour doesn't start by then. On the 30th of June early morning, my contractions started naturally and we waited for a few hours for normal delivery. But, mine was a posterior baby and doctor saw very less chances of a normal delivery. She  explained the condition to us so clearly and we went ahead with a c section. I didn't have the slightest of fear in the operation theatre. I trusted her and she gave us our priceless gift -our little prince. Forever indebted to her!\ud83d\ude07\u2764\ufe0f",

The way she made me comfortable and she made me understand that this journey is not a tough journey but a happy experience. there will be health issues, mood swings, vomit, constipation and many other things but i should be relaxed. \n\nDuring my all scans and check-ups, she never said any single thing which can be disturbing for me. Even if i had issues, she always explained things very politely.\n\nShe was always available on her phone also incase i have any query or issues.\n\nShe delivered my healthy baby as if i am her own family member. I am very thankful to her as this journey would have been very difficult if she wouldn't be my Dr. I thank her for all the support and patience she carried during the journey.\n\nEven now after 3 months of my delivery also, if i have any query regarding my health or any issues, she is still always there.\n\nI must say, in this time when medical facilities has become a a curse, she is someone who is doing her job with all her heart..\n\nThank you Dr Kavita.",

As we were in lockdown in 2020, we were a bit worried about getting the regular pregnancy check-up done by right Dr. and at a right hospital. Finally, we managed to find Dr. Kavitha Lakshmi at CloudNine, HRBR. \n\nDr. Kavitha is very kind, friendly and very professional. I feel lucky to have found Dr. Kavitha for my second baby. While most of the DRs in Bangalore doesn't even listen to patients properly, she had patience to listen to our complete history on our first visit. Also, she recommends to do tests only when it is necessary.\n\nAlso, Dr. Kavitha had given liberty to call her in case of any emergency and that gave me confidence and I felt safe during my pregnancy. Dr was also kind enough to adjust her schedule to have the delivery done during her busy hours. \n\nOverall, my second delivery has been a great experience with all guidance from Dr. Kavitha mam. Thank you very much, mam!",

(I request not to call her unless it is an emergency )\nEven when I was in the labour ward - she made me feel very comfortable and I appreciate her patience and humble nature.

I liked her behavior, way of cummunication, however most impressive things I found her that she dosen't have attitude of being doctor, a successful Doctor.\r\n\r\nShe has blessed me for good Baby for this as I had painful experience in first pregnancy case.\r\n\r\nSo far her word has become true.  I am not rich person in term of money so bit scared about what  would be total delivery expenses in MotherHood Hospital but one thing I must know that Dr. Kavita Lakshmi Easwaran would be my only doctor who would help us to get our first baby.\r\n\r\nI think I trust her now.

As we know this time the whole world is dealing with covid 19 and we need such types of doctors. We got our second child(baby boy) delivered in Cloudnine Hospital, Horamavu recently and the kind of service the hospital had provided is really commendable. My experience during my delivery period was awesome . I would highly recommend considering Cloudnine hospital for delivery and post natal care and of course Dr.Kavitha for Consultation. Thank you so much Doctor for your help in making my pregnancy and delivery a wonderful, happy, and loving experience.",

I delivered a baby boy on 10.3.2022 after 7 yrs of married life. I had PCOS issue which was well treated by Dr and finally I conceived within 1 month of consulting her. \n\nThen the major problem started which is hypertension, Dr took utmost care of me as if I was her sister. She was always available on watsapp/ call to clear my queries at any given point of time. \n\nShe will never scare you or never leave you with a question mark, she would explain everything in detail which makes us feel relaxed. She will never prescribe unwanted tests or medicines. \n\nAt 1 given point in time, we had to take decision to deliver the baby in 34+ weeks. The way my guardian angel dealt was phenomenal! She gave us time to decide and never rushed for a immediate decision, assured us that baby and me would be fine without any complications. \n\nShe is such a dedicated lady who came early in the morning at 5, just to handle my case! She came with a bright smile and told me to relax everything will be fine! 5.16am my bundle of joy came out to this world! What a joyous moment it was!\n\nAll thanks to my dear Dr. Kavitha Lakshmi.\n\nI'm completely happy with her and her treatment and would refer to my family/ friends.\n\nWe love you loads guardian angel!\n\nRegards,\nVikram, Thabitha and Dudu",

I have always felt Ma'am very friendly during our visits and gives the motherly touch to advice on things to be followed. She even helped to choose the best options for delivery and on my delivery day tried so much for Normal delivery. But since the labour couldn't progress we had to go for emergency C-section keeping the safety of me n Baby in mind. \n\nVery Happy that she gave all the care and attention during pregnancy and post delivery n follow-up consultation too.

She is so systematic with her work and does not let even the smallest doubt remain in us. She has been available and approachable at any point of time. In the 35th week of pregnancy, all of a sudden when the baby weight seemed to be a little high, the words she told me were: \"Every baby is unique..some babies are born chubby..we do not have the right to alter that and therefore please continue your usual diet and follow the routine exercises. Do not try to control the baby's weight by eating less. The mother needs to be fit\". These words instilled so much confidence in me. July 1st was the expected due date and doctor asked me to get admitted on the 30th of June if labour doesn't start by then. On the 30th of June early morning, my contractions started naturally and we waited for a few hours for normal delivery. But, mine was a posterior baby and doctor saw very less chances of a normal delivery. She  explained the condition to us so clearly and we went ahead with a c section. I didn't have the slightest of fear in the operation theatre. I trusted her and she gave us our priceless gift -our little prince. Forever indebted to her!\ud83d\ude07\u2764\ufe0f",

The way she made me comfortable and she made me understand that this journey is not a tough journey but a happy experience. there will be health issues, mood swings, vomit, constipation and many other things but i should be relaxed. \n\nDuring my all scans and check-ups, she never said any single thing which can be disturbing for me. Even if i had issues, she always explained things very politely.\n\nShe was always available on her phone also incase i have any query or issues.\n\nShe delivered my healthy baby as if i am her own family member. I am very thankful to her as this journey would have been very difficult if she wouldn't be my Dr. I thank her for all the support and patience she carried during the journey.\n\nEven now after 3 months of my delivery also, if i have any query regarding my health or any issues, she is still always there.\n\nI must say, in this time when medical facilities has become a a curse, she is someone who is doing her job with all her heart..\n\nThank you Dr Kavita.",

As we were in lockdown in 2020, we were a bit worried about getting the regular pregnancy check-up done by right Dr. and at a right hospital. Finally, we managed to find Dr. Kavitha Lakshmi at CloudNine, HRBR. \n\nDr. Kavitha is very kind, friendly and very professional. I feel lucky to have found Dr. Kavitha for my second baby. While most of the DRs in Bangalore doesn't even listen to patients properly, she had patience to listen to our complete history on our first visit. Also, she recommends to do tests only when it is necessary.\n\nAlso, Dr. Kavitha had given liberty to call her in case of any emergency and that gave me confidence and I felt safe during my pregnancy. Dr was also kind enough to adjust her schedule to have the delivery done during her busy hours. \n\nOverall, my second delivery has been a great experience with all guidance from Dr. Kavitha mam. Thank you very much, mam!",

(I request not to call her unless it is an emergency )\nEven when I was in the labour ward - she made me feel very comfortable and I appreciate her patience and humble nature.

I was not aware of that the person/lady to whome I am going to me would stand much beyond my expectation. She was  Dr. Kavitha Lakshmi Easwaran. I liked her behavior, way of cummunication, however most impressive things I found her that she dosen't have attitude of being doctor, a successful Doctor.\r\n\r\nShe has blessed me for good Baby for this as I had painful experience in first pregnancy case.\r\n\r\nSo far her word has become true.  I am not rich person in term of money so bit scared about what  would be total delivery expenses in MotherHood Hospital but one thing I must know that Dr. Kavita Lakshmi Easwaran would be my only doctor who would help us to get our first baby.\r\n\r\nI think I trust her now.

She is very friendly and most importantly provides a positive vibe each time you meet her. I was very much scared about the health of my baby due to previous health issues faced in my first pregnancy. But Dr.Kavitha provided me full support and confidence which really helped me in delivering a healthy baby girl. She is very approachable which is important during this pandemic time. She recieves calls and replies to messages without any hesitation at any point of  time. Me and my family are very much happy with this pregnancy. She explained very well and took care about the complications I went through during the pregnancy. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a smooth, safe and happy pregnancy journey to visit Dr.Kavitha. Thank you so much Doctor for the care you have given me \ud83d\ude42",

When we first met she gave us enormous confidence, and we were immediately sure who our gynecologist would be. Amidst the lockdown and having 2 miscarriages earlier, we were very concerned about our pregnancy, and Dr.Kavitha always referred to as precious pregnancy during each visit. And, it is indeed our precious baby. She was very patient and guided us through delivering a healthy baby.My husband and I will be grateful to Dr. Kavitha. She has been a blessing to us, and she is the reason for our happiness who bought the bundle of joy to our life. Our heartfelt thanks go to Dr. Kavitha and her team at Sai Speciality for all the timely support. I would strongly say that one can reach out to her for pregnancy. *** ** *** ********",

I was diagnosed with one side blocked tube and was suggested to undergo those treatments before. We were ready to try the same set of treatments again, but doctor did not rush through this. March 7 2020 we went for general consultation, she suggested some basic blood test and gave some egg growth medication, she never mentioned the previous failures as reason and asked for iui or IVF, even though we were ready for that. The positive feeling that I got that month was immense, in the same month we got conceived. The struggle of 4 years vanished just like that in one month. To us she is a God in disguise. It\u2019s been a month since I delivered a baby boy. Even now if any doubt I reach out to doctor on whatsapp, never once she skipped to answer my concerns.",

We were very happy on the first visit itself, as she was very soft and friendly, in speaking and listening, understanding our issues (my wife has PCOD).  Her treatment and guidance helped us to get pregnant.  Dr. Kavitha was there with us in the entire journey of pregnancy, The entire pregnancy were managed by ourselves without family support due to COVID. I would say without Dr.Kavitha's care and help we wouldn't have got our little girl delivered safe & easy in this COVID situation.  I strongly recommend Dr. Kavitha to anybody without second thought.  ",

She didn't behaved properly with my wife, but because of circumstances we couldn't oppose about it. She was just in a hurry to just sent us back as soon as possible. She even misbehaved with my wife during the conversation.\n\n2.) She was talking about principles and standards she has followed at her clinic, and irony is for every other appointment she was late for >1hr.\n\n3.) Every time reports were messed up and were not organized properly, \n         a.) Once they gave me incorrect reports and I was the one who pointed \n              out and explained them their mistake.\n         b.) They missed out one test and did the same test again.\n\n4.)  Tests and scans extremely expensive. I didn't see any sort of service even for consultation I paid for, it lasted for 3-4 mins, always in a hurry to finish it off, my wife couldn't clear her doubts properly. \n\n5.) Overall, pregnancy related things are very critical things and think twice before consulting here.",

My mom is well on her way to recovery now.  Dr Kavitha is that kind of rare doctor who can take away half your illness by just the way she smiles and talks to you. We felt totally at ease to ask even the most private embarrassing sort of gynaecological questions thanks to her open inviting approach. Will recommend her any day happily to anyone. And certainly plan to run back to her anytime a need arises. My mother even told dr kavitha she liked her so much ! We also noticed that she was very polite gentle n patient with even her hospital support staff.",
