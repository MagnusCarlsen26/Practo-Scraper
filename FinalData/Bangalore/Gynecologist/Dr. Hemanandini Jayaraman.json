I called the hospital to confirm they said the doctor is on leave! but there's another gynac on call who can see me. So I walked the 1.5 kms to reach the hospital. Upon reaching i was told there is no gynac available! is this a joke to you guys?Also, if a particular doctor is on leave then why isn't practo doing its due diligence and updating their app??? Why is the doctor also making slots available at practo? Most horrible experience and half a day gone! ",

I went to apoorva diagnostic clinic and then was told the doctor sits at apoorva hospital whic is 1.5 kms away. I called the hospital to confirm they said the doctor is on leave! but there's another gynac on call who can see me. So I walked the 1.5 kms to reach the hospital. Upon reaching i was told there is no gynac available! is this a joke to you guys?Also, if a particular doctor is on leave then why isn't practo doing its due diligence and updating their app??? Why is the doctor also making slots available at practo? Most horrible experience and half a day gone! ",
