Myself and my husband for the first time we visited Balaji Health care center for pregnancy planning.  we met DR Jyoti Lakshmi mam for the first time , just by checking the reviews in practo , we felt that she might be good and we visited her in her own clinic Balaji Health Care Center RT Nagar.  So during the first consulation itself she was very friendly with us and used to explain and answer to questions. During the first consultation mam asked us to undergo few tests , after test I got to know that i am having hormonal imbalances. So currently taking treatment for that with Jyoti lakshmi mam. She will prepare our body for pregnancy.  Unfortunately during my first consultation i was diagnosed with one of the rare case , and that rare case was found by Jyoti lakshmi mam. And she suggested us that we have to go for hymenotomy surgery(minor surgery max of 15 to 30 mins) , Jyoti lakshmi mam only operated it . And now I am normal. The case which was happened to me was  very rarest case . But  with doctor experience  she was able to tackle and operate it successfully.  Now  she is preparing my body to get pregnant.
