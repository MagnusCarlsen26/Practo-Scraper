During the first consultation mam asked us to undergo few tests , after test I got to know that i am having hormonal imbalances. So currently taking treatment for that with Jyoti lakshmi mam. She will prepare our body for pregnancy.  Unfortunately during my first consultation i was diagnosed with one of the rare case , and that rare case was found by Jyoti lakshmi mam.
