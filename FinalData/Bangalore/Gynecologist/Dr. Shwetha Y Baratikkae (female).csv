Nurses were telling she went on OT. Finally my wife went her to show previously written comments. But bad luck is she doesn't have patience to listen her problem. she was in urgency, didn't looked report as well, didn't ask what is the problem also. My concern is if she is busy then she could have ask to come next day, instead of telling you don't have any issue. Off-course we have some problem then only we are going to hospital, otherwise to simply spend money and time who will go to hospital.
