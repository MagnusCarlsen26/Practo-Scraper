,,0,0,YES,"Toughest phase of my life turned out to be positive after meeting Dr.Sowparnika as I took an appointment to meet Dr.Sowparnika after my friend got her positive results and Now I feel this is the best decision I ever made. I consulted the doctor and discussed my concerns with her and she did verify my reports and suggested me the necessary treatment and I am happy to say that I did get my positive pregnancy result which I was unable to believe. Also, most of the doctors I have met tried to push through unnecessary tests and procedures but trust me Dr. Sowparnika is genuine enough and she did not suggest me any unnecessary procedures told by the previous docs that I visited and she did provide me the right treatment accordingly. She has the passion for her work and considers every single patients concern. I am truly blessed to have met her and I am now blessed with a baby girl.",2022-07-29 03:55:38,False,True,Sanchaya,,,
