She explained details about the delivery and was always open to the option we wanted to go ahead with.\n\nI was very nervous and anxious when i was in the OT and maam helped me calm down and assured everything would be alright, 15 minutes later I heard my baby boy\u2019s first cry who was in perfect health. I was able to walk and be active after only 2 days of delivery. It has been 1.5 months since delivery and I and the baby are in perfect health, and I have had good recovery & no complications.\n\nFrom admission for delivery at Ovum Hospital till discharge, she was always available to address our every need. \n\nShe\u2019s a calm, composed and extremely kind person, it is very comforting to talk to her. If we do plan for a next pregnancy, we know we would surely go ahead and choose Dr. Manjula Patil and would highly recommend her ** *** ** ********** *** ** *** **** ******* ** *********.",

On our first meeting she was very very understanding, very patient, heard my concerns, Told me all options and answered all my queries (no matter how silly they sounded). Later I visited her for full time pregnancy and was under her observation for full 39 weeks.  Couple of things that really stood out 1- She knows her stuff, very confident but very down to earth 2- She hears your concern, asks how u feeling and tries to make the whole 9 month journey as amicable as possible. During my pregnancy She properly monitored my health condition and made me smooth normal delivery.  3. She is lovely to speak at every appointment, she listen problems and Explains all the medicine she is giving.\n4-She is available for any SOS calls. I have messaged her at odd hours (I found some rash and freaked out) and she responds as quickly as possible. Even I called her at 4 AM and she responded me very smoothly. This is rare to find.  \n5-When I got labour pain and I was unable to tolerate I said to the doctor gowith c sec. when I got overly emotional and cried but she was so patient and understanding and like an elder sister heard me and answered my concerns. 6- I had a very smooth normal Delivery. Again a very very good experience. She talks to you before the procedure, during and after as well. Always goes out of her way to make patient comfortable. When I was in labour room and my husband was waiting outside of the room but doctor call and asked him to stay with me. I felt so calm and happy ! . \n\nOverall - 10/10 for patient care,* **** ********* * *** ***** \nwonderful doctor !\n\nI would like to recommend the doctor Manjula S Patil\n\nThanks you so much Dr. Manjula mam\n",

Dr. Manjula was persistent in ensuring a proper prognosis before prescribing any high-dosage medications, a testament to her thorough and meticulously cautious approach. \n\nDr. Manjula truly felt like a godsent angel in my life, especially as she is the first gynecologist I've seen in my 42 years. Her expertise in her field, combined with the positivity she radiates, significantly impacts her patients\u2019 mindset. Additionally, her warm smile immediately puts you at ease, making the entire experience much more comfortable.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Manjula to anyone in need of gynecological services. She is not only an expert in her field but also brings a level of compassion and reassurance that is truly rare.",

I\u2019d consulted a well known doctor in Mysore once before, who had told me that it was not possible for me to have a full term pregnancy and that I would have to get a C section at 8th month itself, which had got us worried a lot. After hearing a lot of positive reviews about Dr. Manjula, I consulted her, who from the very beginning told me that even after being on blood thinner injections everyday, full term pregnancy and normal delivery was very much possible and the same happened. \n\nI cannot thank Dr. Manjula ma\u2019am enough for the support through out my pregnancy and during my labour too. I was scared about my labour regarding how painful it\u2019d be. But as I laid on the labour bed, Manjula ma\u2019am and her team before me (who at that moment looked like Avengers who had come to save me, lol!), I knew that I was in the safest hands possible. Also, the calmness and the smile on her face gives anyone the strength to believe that anything\u2019s possible.\n\nConsulting Dr. Manjula ma\u2019am was the best decision I made and I cannot thank her enough.

She explained details about the delivery and was always open to the option we wanted to go ahead with.\n\nI was very nervous and anxious when i was in the OT and maam helped me calm down and assured everything would be alright, 15 minutes later I heard my baby boy\u2019s first cry who was in perfect health. I was able to walk and be active after only 2 days of delivery. It has been 1.5 months since delivery and I and the baby are in perfect health, and I have had good recovery & no complications.\n\nFrom admission for delivery at Ovum Hospital till discharge, she was always available to address our every need. \n\nShe\u2019s a calm, composed and extremely kind person, it is very comforting to talk to her. If we do plan for a next pregnancy, we know we would surely go ahead and choose Dr. Manjula Patil and would highly recommend her ** *** ** ********** *** ** *** **** ******* ** *********.",

On our first meeting she was very very understanding, very patient, heard my concerns, Told me all options and answered all my queries (no matter how silly they sounded). Later I visited her for full time pregnancy and was under her observation for full 39 weeks.  Couple of things that really stood out 1- She knows her stuff, very confident but very down to earth 2- She hears your concern, asks how u feeling and tries to make the whole 9 month journey as amicable as possible. During my pregnancy She properly monitored my health condition and made me smooth normal delivery.  3. She is lovely to speak at every appointment, she listen problems and Explains all the medicine she is giving.\n4-She is available for any SOS calls. I have messaged her at odd hours (I found some rash and freaked out) and she responds as quickly as possible. Even I called her at 4 AM and she responded me very smoothly. This is rare to find.  \n5-When I got labour pain and I was unable to tolerate I said to the doctor gowith c sec. when I got overly emotional and cried but she was so patient and understanding and like an elder sister heard me and answered my concerns. 6- I had a very smooth normal Delivery. Again a very very good experience. She talks to you before the procedure, during and after as well. Always goes out of her way to make patient comfortable. When I was in labour room and my husband was waiting outside of the room but doctor call and asked him to stay with me. I felt so calm and happy ! . \n\nOverall - 10/10 for patient care,* **** ********* * *** ***** \nwonderful doctor !\n\nI would like to recommend the doctor Manjula S Patil\n\nThanks you so much Dr. Manjula mam\n",

Dr. Manjula was persistent in ensuring a proper prognosis before prescribing any high-dosage medications, a testament to her thorough and meticulously cautious approach. \n\nDr. Manjula truly felt like a godsent angel in my life, especially as she is the first gynecologist I've seen in my 42 years. Her expertise in her field, combined with the positivity she radiates, significantly impacts her patients\u2019 mindset. Additionally, her warm smile immediately puts you at ease, making the entire experience much more comfortable.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Manjula to anyone in need of gynecological services. She is not only an expert in her field but also brings a level of compassion and reassurance that is truly rare.",

I\u2019d consulted a well known doctor in Mysore once before, who had told me that it was not possible for me to have a full term pregnancy and that I would have to get a C section at 8th month itself, which had got us worried a lot. After hearing a lot of positive reviews about Dr. Manjula, I consulted her, who from the very beginning told me that even after being on blood thinner injections everyday, full term pregnancy and normal delivery was very much possible and the same happened. \n\nI cannot thank Dr. Manjula ma\u2019am enough for the support through out my pregnancy and during my labour too. I was scared about my labour regarding how painful it\u2019d be. But as I laid on the labour bed, Manjula ma\u2019am and her team before me (who at that moment looked like Avengers who had come to save me, lol!), I knew that I was in the safest hands possible. Also, the calmness and the smile on her face gives anyone the strength to believe that anything\u2019s possible.\n\nConsulting Dr. Manjula ma\u2019am was the best decision I made and I cannot thank her enough.

During scan our doctor noticed she could see some membrane it\u2019s seems, which was sign of cervix might be got open. Hence for expert advice we got referred to Dr Manjula Patil at Motherhood hospital HRBR layout. Over there during scan and investigation she found my wife cervix was completely opened and doctor was able to see membrane. It seemed both babies were okay and around 900 gm weight by then but the challenge was if the cervix kept it can be ruptured anytime which will lead to premature delivery.\n\nDr Manjula madam explained all the details and pros and cons about the surgery. So now the only option was left to stich the cervix by pushing the babies inside which itself was great risk and chances of success was less than 5%. We didn\u2019t had much options so in order to save the little ones from premature delivery which itself was great risk for their survival. Anyhow we decided to go as per Dr Manjula advice for cervical stitches. There was also high chance during the cervical stitch procedure babies could push back and which would lead to emergency C-section. \n\nDr Manjula Mam took the heroic stand and was successfully able to push the babies inside and stitched the cervix. Post which my wife was kept under observation for 48hrs, and when everything was normal we were allowed to go home. \n\nFrom here on the journey was more tough everyday was like a bonus for us and every week was like a milestone. At home my wife was on completely bed rest and was only allowed to get up for bathroom use.\n\nDays went slow from here on, after completing 30 weeks we had a scan and everything was found normal and baby growth was also good. Babies weight was around 1.5 kg. \n\nWe reached 32 weeks, which was the minimum target set by the doctor, both babies were doing good.\n\nStaring 34 weeks my wife started feeling more pain and discomfort, back was also started hurting during sleep. During the regular visit Dr Manjula checked and found the cervix was barely trying to hold the pressure. So she updated it was time for delivery. \n\nOn 22nd March we got admitted and on 23rd March we are blessed with twins baby girls !! First baby weight 2.2 kg and second baby 2.3 kg. Both babies and mother are doing good, for observation both babies were kept in NICU. \n\nFrom NICU One baby was handed over after 24 hrs monitoring and another one after 36 hrs. Both the babies are healthy and doing good now. This miracle journey for our babies wouldn\u2019t been possible without support of Dr Manjula Patil !! \n\nMe and my entire family is very grateful to Dr. Manjula Mam for her support and giving new lives to our babies. We had a very remarkable experience with Motherhood. We want to thank each and every staff of motherhood for their dedication and support. \n",

All thanks to Dr  Manjula for navigating us through it. We reached out to Dr Manjula when we were planning to expand our family. Right from the very moment we consulted her she was kind and empathetic. She understood from where we were coming and listened to each and every question patiently even if some of those were silly doubts.Post consultantation we started on our journey and finally concieved. My first trimester was pretty turbulent. I was nauseaus, literally puking my guts out. Everytime my hopes and morals went down, Dr. Manjula lifted us with her energy and medical expertise.Second trimester for us was a breeze! We were even able to take a little vacation. All these while Dr Manjula was available on whatsapp and responded whenever we needed any counsel. That was a huge assurance and relief.Cut to third trimester, it almost felt like the plane that was flying well up until now was about to sink! I started getting pre term labour contractions. I was admitted multiple times. It was painful and exhausting. There have been multiple times when we thought the baby will come anytime prematurely but Dr Manjula somehow stayed calm. I dont know how she does it but it felt like she was on a battle for us to nurse the baby till full term. It would have been probably easier to take out the baby at 29 weeks but Dr Manjula did everything in her capacity and managed navigate the pregnancy from 29th week till 34th weeks, up until my water broke! Finally our Amaya came into this world on 5th May, 2021 via c-section. Honestly, I was very skeptical about c-section but medically that was the best option at that point and we trusted Dr Manjula's judgement on it fully. She helped me get over my fear. My recovery was super quick. I was pretty much back on my feet next morning. All of these could happen because Dr Manjula had faith! She is not just an exceptional Doctor but the sweetest person we know and we are so glad that she delivered our baby. She has that motherly, humane touch which is so rare to find.Also, big vote of thanks to all the LDR doctors and nurses team, nenatology team, pediatrics team, canteen staffs, housekeeping staffs and the rest everyone at Motherhood, HRBR Layout for taking such good care of us. Since our baby was preterm, she needed that extra care. Even admidst covid scare, motherhood's nenatology team took utmost care of our baby and we cannot be thankful enough!I was admitted so many times that by the time we left the hospital we formed that bond. We could not have asked for a better journey to become parents",

                "review_text": "This could easily be too small space to provide a detailed Feedback. Let me break this into couple of parts for anyone who is reading this while planning to consult Dr.Manjula especially during Early Pregnancy.\n\nWhat, When, Where, Who and Why's :\n\nWhat:\nWhat made me select Motherhood Hospital and consult Dr.Manjula?\nI have been introduced to Motherhood about 2 years ago for another procedure. The experiences I had during the procedure made me realise that the Doctors, Staff, facilities and Services offered in Motherhood were above my expectations. I am not even going to try to compare other hospitals, I witnessed the number of births and happy parents within the same week in this hospital.\nNalini was the first person I spoke to from Motherhood, during the phase when we were planning for Dual Opinion and Delivery/Birth. We specifically requested for an experienced doctor with great patient history. She recommended Dr. Manjula, couple of weeks later We are thankful to her, Doctor and the entire staff.\n\nWhen:\na) When did I decide to have the delivery with her help?\nI have had 3 Missed abortions in the past, all with no heartbeats. During the 4th Planned pregnancy (where my and my husband were not planning to take any Risk), We had been consulting 2 Doctors for dual opinion. One being from another Hospital from RammurthyNagar. I did decide to stay only with Dr. Manjula, **** ** **** ******* ********* ** *** ******** *** ********* ********* If I went by her opinion, My child would've been born in June last week coz of the Cord around the neck and Thin Placenta. On the other hand, Dr. Manjula adviced that there's no reason to be worried and to continue until the first week of July with a NST Scan. She assured us that everything is under control, and gave us a heads-up that only when I felt there's no baby movement or water bursts I need to get admitted immediately. Thanks to her suggestion, It indeed went well, everything went smooth !!\n\nb) When was she helpful and supportive?\n- During the regular visits to hospital\n- Even when i just planned to walk-in after her normal consultation hours/duration, she stayed back for us !!\n- During the Prenatal Phase when I had questions about the changes in my body, risks, and updates, she answer every piece of my query.\n- During the Natal Phase/Delivery/Birth. She ensured the safety of myself and my baby, kept my husband updated/informed at every stage.\n- The day when I was getting Discharged\n- After the delivery, she continued to answer my questions.\n\nWhere:\nWhere did I get her help?\na) At the Motherhood Hospital, HRBR Layout, on every visit i got positive advices, suggestions and vibes from her.\nb) At Home, She was available for direct calls/messages.\n\nWho:\nWho should meet or consult Dr. Manjula?\nAll Expecting Parents, especially first pregnancies. She is an expert in Normal Deliveries, To be honest My Delivery was almost painless bcoz of her expertise, and her team !! Although I truly appreciate her team, her efforts outshines everytime i recall how nervous we have been since it became our first successful birth !!\n\nWhy:\nWhy should you consult Dr. Manjula (Instead of any other doctors around HRBR Layout, Bansaswadi, Rammurthy Nagar, Hennur Area)\nIf you are close or in this area, good for you, go for the consultation with her. Trust me, you'll feel better when you would step outside of the hospital.\nShe listens to your query, goes thru every minute detail of your/Patient's case history, performs thorough checkup and recommends medication and tests only if its required. She may give you all possibilities in the future based on your case of pregnancy and scenario, to ensure you're prepared in every possible way, this is Awesome !!",

The emotional pain was overwhelming, and it was during this challenging time that we sought the guidance of Dr. Manjula. Though our subsequent attempt, post her consultation, ended in the fetal heartbeat stopping at 8 weeks, Dr. Manjula's empathetic approach provided us with the strength to persevere.\n\nFollowing a six-month break, we decided to try again with the hope that things would be different. Unfortunately, history repeated itself, and my wife had to undergo her second DNC. It was during this phase that Dr. Manjula's expertise shone through. She identified the root cause\u2014an Autoimmune issue. With proper treatment over the course of 8 months, she instilled confidence in us and committed to guiding us through the process once again.\n\nUnder Dr. Manjula's unwavering guidance during our third attempt, the level of care and dedication she demonstrated was beyond description. She made herself available at any time of the day or night, addressing even our simplest doubts. Her reassuring demeanor provided us with the confidence that we were in safe hands. We had regular check-ins every 15 days to ensure that the pregnancy was progressing well.\n\nOn 23rd November 2023, our journey with Dr. Manjula culminated in the birth of a healthy baby girl. The joy and gratitude we feel are indescribable.\n\nThis review serves as a testament to the remarkable doctor that Dr. Manjula is. Her services to the people at your HRBR Bangalore facility are nothing short of amazing. I implore you to recognize and preserve the treasure you have in her.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to highlight that if anyone is going through a complicated pregnancy, Dr. Manjula S Patil is the one to contact. Her expertise, compassion, and commitment make her an invaluable asset to the medical fraternity.\n\nThank you for fostering an environment where such outstanding medical professionals can thrive and make a significant difference in the lives of those they touch.",

I was scared of normal delivery however doctor explained things really well to me and gave me options though it was difficult for me to bear the pain I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if not for her, she stood by my side genuinely cared for me and was so happy once I delivered the baby she even stayed back and stitched me up herself without having her assistant or other nurses do it. I\u2019m extremely thankful to her because if not for her I might have ended up having a c-section but the doctor made sure I delivered normally and showed her genuine care throughout my delivery process.

Navigating the complexities of pregnancy planning, particularly given my type 1 diabetes, was an intricate challenge. Our journey began in June 2022, and after encountering a few minor obstacles, we had the privilege of meeting Dr. Manjula in November 2022. Right from the outset, her demeanor exuded warmth and professionalism that resonated with us deeply.\n\nRemarkably, our fortunes took a wonderful turn as we conceived in that very month, marking the commencement of our remarkable voyage into parenthood\u2014a journey closely intertwined with our beloved Dr. Manjula. Having previously sought counsel from some of the most esteemed gynecologists in Bengaluru, it was Dr. Manjula Mam's meticulous attention and exceptional ability to forge connections that set her apart. Her willingness to invest genuine time in her patients is a true rarity and something we cherished immensely.\n\nMy medical history, encompassing diabetes and a prior open myectomy, was intricate. Dr. Manjula expertly orchestrated the entirety of my pregnancy, orchestrating meticulously timed consultations and tests. Throughout, I never felt overwhelmed, drawing strength from each interaction with Mam.\n\nDuring the initial and middle phases of pregnancy, I encountered concerning bleeding episodes. Dr. Manjula's wealth of experience and her soothing disposition proved to be invaluable during this time. Her constant accessibility and unwavering support around the clock were genuinely comforting. Her pragmatic and relaxed advice on navigating the pregnancy journey was a beacon of reassurance. From the outset until delivery day, she served as our guiding light, unwavering in her commitment.\n\nFor anyone embarking on the wondrous path of parenthood, I wholeheartedly endorse Dr. Manjula. Rest assured, you'll find yourself in the most capable and caring hands.",

Everything was so minutely taken care of that it gave me a feeling of home away from home with all staff and doctors making me feel as part of the family. I thank Dr. Manjula, from the bottom of my heart. \\nFor her it may be one more success story in her career but for us, proud parents, this has brought a whole new feeling and meaning in our life.\\n\\nMy husband and I would like to thank you for taking part in the birth of our little baby girl. We all know that the tension was high that day. We felt very comfortable and confident knowing that you would be able to handle any situation if one was to arise. You are amazing! You knew when to be serious and when to make us laugh. We will never forget that day or you!\\u201d\\n\\nWhat I liked about Dr. Manjula is very unique, her body language, dressing sense, always fresh minded, positive vibes inside her cabin Me and my Husband come out of her cabin with a smile.    \\nDr. MANJULA was available on whatsapp\\/phone even on odd times for any kind of emergencies throughout my pregnancy.\\n\\n\\\"I would recommend DOCTOR MANJULA S PATIL to anyone who has been trying to have a baby for a long time and needs the right advice.

The overall process from admission till discharge went smooth and well managed. Her experience and skills made our journey and the last lap a very good overall experience.\nDr. Manjula Mam has vast experience and knowledge about all the aspects associated with pregnancy.\nAs this was my first pregnancy I had many doubts/questions and every time she used to clarify my doubts with great patience. She is very friendly and calm and you can rely upon her treatment without any doubt. We followed her consultation from day one and were very much comfortable with her.\nAs we did not had any prior Gynecologist experience whatsoever! Thanks to Manjula Mam, we are blessed to have her as our doctor.\nWe got endless Mental support, she is very patient in listening and gives you the **** diagnosis, medications and best Labor room experience. She was available all the time whenever we needed over call or messages. \nAlso, post-pregnancy, she provided complete guidance.\n\nAgain Me and my family will be always thankful to you Mam. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a professional yet friendly gynecologist.\n\n\n",

She is so sensitive and considerate about your problems with amazing intuition , politeness and patience for patients that most indian doctors unfortunately lack. I have been told by other doctors \"Not to Google and ask questions!!\" Which is terrible advice especially for first time parents.\n\nAn expecting mother has every right to politely ask as many questions about her medication or options or issues because the doctors abroad that I was accustomed to were really trained in psychological counseling and being polite and kind to patients which I was looking for in a doctor here in Bangalore during Covid after shifting back to India.\n\nAfter visiting and consulting many doctors who I prefer not to name I was shocked with the unprofessional and rude - sometimes downright dictatorial insensitive behavior of some so called doctors who hold many degrees but unfortunately lack the technical knowledge and human kindness - empathy for a patient. I sincerely am impressed with Dr. Manjula's knowledge and skills/expertise. I told her I am very comfortable with a c section if needed as I trust her judgement completely but she insisted on a normal vaginal delivery and in Dec 2020 - I gave birth to a healthy baby boy despite some of the complications I felt safe and secure the entire time as she patiently explained the pros and cons to me and my husband answering all our questions.\n\nShe is the only doctor I have met with no chaotic - negative energy around her at all , its very positive blessed vibes which is why I wanted her to be the first person to touch our child as they do say some of the personality and positive energy is transferred onto the child. :)  In india with the quality of doctors depreciating as far as I have seen its a rare few that are genuinely interested in your well being so please choose wisely. \n\nBest",

So decided to consult there for Surgery. \n\nWhile looking at list of Doctors available at the nearest Motherhood Hospital HRBR layout branch was confused for a moment to choose a right Doctor from the avaliable list for consultation. \n\nWhile looking at the details of Doctor's with their specialization and experience, we made up our mind to consult with Dr.Manjula S Patil. Which was one of the best decisions we took.\n\nWe met the doctor for the first time in the first week of January 2022. We never felt like it was the first time that we were consulting with doctor, actually after meeting the doctor we felt like having an association with the Doctor for ages. This feeling came to us because of the very friendly nature of Doctor with her special way of approach. \n\nBefore meeting the Doctor we had decided to undergo the surgery on 28.01.2022 due to weekend and also due to some auspicious reasons. The same date was discussed with Doctor for surgery, Doctor asked whether we can do the surgery one prior or later to 28th. But we requested Doctor for doing the surgery on 28th itself and Doctor agreed to do it in the morning around 6.30am\n\nDr.Manjula S Patil was there at 6.30am sharp and executed the surgery for around 4hrs. The surgery was very much successful. \n\nDr. Manjula madam treated us like one of her family members from day one to till date.\n\nI really appreciate the dedication of Dr.Manjula Madam for giving respect and value for request by conducting the Successful Surgery on 28.01.2022 inspite of her family commitments which we came to know later that it was Doctor's wedding anniversary on that day. This is one of the reasons we felt that she has treated us has her family member giving priority to our request. \n\nMe and my wife render gratitude to Dr.Manjula Madam from bottom of our heart and will be thankful to her Motherly affection shown to us. I'm really blessed to get my wife's treatment done under the guidance of Dr.Manjula S Patil. \n\nI would really suggest my family members, Friends and the people who are reading this to consult with Dr.Manjula S Patil related to Obstetrics and Gynecology & For Fibroid treatment. \n\nThanks and Regards \n\nSreesagar Deepak.

She was very patient calm and composed every visit I have met her. Very kind humble human . I had a twin delivery and she was the only person I could believe in because I was blessed with no complications throughout pregnancy only because of Dr Manjula Patil. She was available on phone through out my pregnancy for help . All the pregnant women need a doctor like her.i must say Unlike other doctors she stayed through out the delivery procedure and made sure I was comfortable and relaxed from the beginning till they shifted me to the ward. Infact she did the last stitch up herself with out letting her assistants do it. I m really happy and glad that I have met her and she was a part of my most memorable journey of life. \nI recommend her blindly any day to you all. \n",

This situation helped us in trusting her completely and helped us in deciding to go with doctor instead of Hospital when she moved to Ovum Hospital from Motherhood Hospital. Even though the infrastructure in Ovum was something that can be improved like Lift, Housekeeping and Cafeteria those were secondary to us, what was much more important for us was the doctor and how comfortable we were consulting her. We were amazed to see her calmness and decision taking ability during delivery.  One more experience we had was the scan doctor twice told us to come for follow up scan in a week or so but doctor after looking at the scan reports was honest to us and told follow up scan is not required both the times. Now our son is healthy and 3 weeks old. Thanks a lot for all your support and guidance.",

Her detailed instructions and encouraging words helped us to calm our nerves. \nMy wife's pregnancy journey had started in February 2023. During this journey we encountered very big obstacles like cervical cerclage.  Dr. Manjula guided us very well about this process and gave relaxed advice to us.\nDuring the middle phase of pregnancy, we encountered diabetes also. She helped my wife to monitor sugar level continuously on weekly basis. \nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Manjula to anyone embarking on the wondrous journey of parenthood. You can be confident that you will be in capable and caring hands.",

Based on the positive online reviews, we booked an appointment with Dr. Manjula in Motherhood HRBR layout.  \n\nAt first visit itself, we became very happy and felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind. Dr. Manjula  is jovial and listens to you patiently & gives you sufficient time to say your problems.  It's only because of your expertise, timely care and guidance which helped me to avoid pregnancy complications.  \n\nDuring the last trimester we had to shift to Kerala for delivery, considering family support.  Eventually, we were blessed with a Baby Girl.\n\nMost importantly, as it is the second child, Dr.Manjula  gave good guidance in taking care of the elder son(six years) during pregnancy and after delivery. This indeed helped to build strong bond between our Son & Daughter very early stage itself.\n\nHence I strongly recommend Dr.Manjula.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Manjula from the bottom of our heart for taking such good care of me during the pregnancy \n\nBest wishes\nMekha, Midhun,  MasterVedik , Baby Vajra\n",

It's rare of find a doctor that combines personal touch and care for a patient as a person with outstanding medical achievements. ( probably that is the also the reason why everyone wants their case to be handled by her ) \nI would highly recommend her. ",

First time when we met her, We were greeted with a warm smile and a friendly demeanor. Throughout my wife's pregnancy, Dr. Manjula always took the time to listen to our concerns and answer my questions. She made us feel at ease and confident in their abilities.\n\nThe delivery of my baby was a smooth and positive experience, and I attribute a lot of that to the care and confidence I received from Dr. Manjula. She was supportive, *************, and kind throughout the entire process. I felt like we were in good hands and that my baby's health and well-being was always a top priority. There was a point where we had to choose between Cesarean (C-Sec) or normal due to some complication, but Dr. Manjula's confidence in making it through normal delivery helped us to take an easy call and it was well paid at the end, a flawless normal delivery !\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Manjula S Patil to anyone looking for a gynecologist. She's an excellent practitioner who truly cares about their patients. And a big Thank you, Dr. Manjula, for your amazing care!\n",

At any given time of emergency she was always available to assist directly or thru duty doctors. We are very happy to get in touch with her for our first pregnancy. Main concern as all other dad/mom to be, even we had the same concer i.e, Normal or C-section ? Ma'am always gave us that hope of Normal delivery is the first priority and if any complications only then the thought of c-section. With all this said we are blessed with healthy kid on normal delivery and my wife is also doing good!My advice to all those who are reading this, you can definitely consult Dr. Manjula S Patil without any hesitation or doubt. Above is not a story, it's our true experience with ma'am.Thank you ma'am for all your support.",

Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment with all queries answered which were easily understood.It is difficult to find a doctor who combines personal touch and care for a patient and has high medical experience.\n     With a list of risk factors like - Age - 40 \\/ 2-Laproscopy sessions \\/ SUA and High BP, which otherwise would call for a C- Section, she continued with regular monitoring to attempt for normal delivery(to ensure mother & baby are not at any risk) \n    On the day of delivery, Dr Manjula and team were there all the time and ensured it was a normal delivery.

I would be grateful forever as I had high chances of pre term labor at 7 months due to shortening of cervix which was detected in third trimester but doctor had done cervical cerclage without any delay. She performed regular assessments, ensuring prevention and cure that helped me and my baby to stay healthy.She has always been very approachable and made me feel comfortable with regards to any doubts or concerns that I have had.She has an exceptional quality to bond with patient.Only because of her guidance and care I delivered my baby girl through Normal Delivery at 35 weeks.Thanks again to make my journey smooth even after so many hurdles.",

I was scared of getting uterus removed, even though I am 35-40 age group.\nBased on Practo reviews about Dr. Manjula, we have consulted her. She allayed our concerns, got effective (very important) diagnostic reports, worked on the high-level surgery, and post surgery plan, considering patient's inputs. Dr. Manjula was prepared for all eventualities during surgery (as per diagnostic reports), and discussed with us. \nA special mention for anesthesiologist Dr. Somashree for giving me more confidence. This has helped me get into Operation Theatre, full aware and confident of result. I believe patient's confidence has a strong forebearing in an operation's result. \nThe operation went better than we expected, with fewer cuts, and lesser recovery time. My uterus is intact, instead of multiple sittings, we could get done in a single sitting, and instead of multiple procedures, a single procedure was enough. \nThe doctor has done post-op checks to ensure all is well. The nutritionist gave a high-level understanding of the diet to be followed. \nA special note of thanks to hospital staff for always being around, timely in response, and care provided. \nI am still in post-op recovery at home, and it is better than I expected.",

We felt like we were truly blessed to have Dr manjula who is so friendly, who has got deep knowledge and can give suggestions/advices timely. At times, she sounded bit strict when we missed our check ups but the care and responsibility she provided to her patients is truly and highly appreciable. I'm sure that her patients will feel like they are talking to their close friends and will get soo comfortable eventually. She is definitely one of the best doctors we have seen so far and would love to appreciate her great and tremendous work done with two of our kids. As a doctor, she is technically sounded, highly qualified, humble, very friendly , helps patients to settle down with great gesture and gives valid advises keeping patient's health in future ( always encouraged us to go for a normal deliver, even when we opted for c-sec) which is rare to be seen across we believe. Last but not the least, her communication with us in our local languages helped us a lot to explain issues in details as well as it made us comfortable talking to her on few instances which is very very imp for many people. Finally, we thank her to the greats and her smiles made our lives to smile always with one girl and a boy.",

Her reviews were excellent and what we liked most about her was that she advocates and recommends normal delivery.  Throughout pregnancy she addressed all our questions and concerns. With her high expertise, knowledge and guidance, my wife's pregnancy journey went on smoothly.  During her interaction with the doctor, she assured my wife will have a normal delivery. During labour, there were complications of distress and baby passing motion making normal delivery difficult and challenging. Yet the doctor and her expert team did their level best and made my wife deliver normally. It was an emotional moment for us holding a perfectly healthy baby in our hands. All this was possible only because of Dr Manjula and her excellent team of doctors and nurses.  She also guided my wife on post delivery recovery. Our overall journey can be summed up in one word only, \" Beautiful\" !!",

She was friendly during our first meet and made us comfortable. She suggested us to take our time for conception instead of having deadline. Her words are always encouraging. After conception, she did not tell us to do any unnecessary tests. The experience of going through pregnancy phases was made easy and understanding by the doctor. I was infected by covid mid of my pregnancy, she quickly diagnosed and immediately started with the medication which helped me recover. We were worried alot about the baby, doctor made sure that all our worries are answered. She kept on boosting my confidence during the last phase of pregnancy. During last month of pregnancy, I started getting contraction (36th week), but doctor pushed it, so that I deliver full term baby and thus same happened :-) She tried her best for Viginal delivery, but due to contraction, she had to take a call for C -section, for the safety of me and my baby. And finally I was blessed with the beautiful baby girl. Thank you doctor your support and help made my pregnancy journey memorable one. ",

Since it was our first baby we were scared and anxious about every thing and it was Manjula ma\u2019am who kept us on track and boosted our moral. She understood our question before we ask and throughout my pregnancy and kept us motivated.\n9 September 2020 on our final day, she encouraged us to start thinks normal during my labour and explained things calmly. She took my care through labour and explained how to push and deliver my little angle normally.\nWe were really lucky to have Manjula Ma\u2019am for our pregnancy, she came like saviour in our life in this Covid-19 situation where no was around us to guide and help us to get our angle in our hand safely. I would really suggest friend and family to consult Ma\u2019am. Once you are under her guidance you need not to worry about anything, she will take your all worries and you will be having world precious gift in your hand safely.\n",

Over the past few months, we would have visited her 10-15 times and on every occasion Dr. Manjula addressed all the concerns we had and took us through the logic for each and every test she was recommending. \n\nDuring this time, it is normal to receive zillions of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts from every where you could imagine and having a doctor like Dr. Manjula keeps you grounded.\n\nShe encouraged Rashmi to go for a normal delivery despite few issues with growth of the baby. She, at times, would pinged Rashmi to check if she was doing ok during her 39 weeks \n\nDr. Manjula is extremely nice, smart and expert in her field. She made us feel confident of the entire process and we had a wonderful experience with her. \n\nThanks a lot doctor for delivering us Anaira",

With our every visit we came to know her even better and felt blessed that we have chosen her for our first delivery. \nEverything was going on fine until we had the Anomaly scan, my wife was diagnosed with Single umbilical artery (SUA). We knew nothing about this and after we searched it over the internet, we became even more worried.  On our next appointment Dr Manjula not only did a fine counselling but also gave us the assurance that she is there to help us with this condition and we can go home without any worries. I must say she stood by her words and examined by wife on regular basis and ascertained that the child growth was happening properly and there were no other complexities. Finally, on 17th of July my wife was admitted and after 14 hours she normally delivered a healthy beautiful baby girl. In the labor room she had given motherly comfort and constant confidence to my wife. We were able to achieve a smooth delivery only because of Dr Manjula\u2019s phenomenal experience, excellence and patience. We know we cannot thank her enough, so we are not doing that instead we pray for her success and good health and wish all her all the best.\n",

The best decision we took was to start our pregnancy journey under the guidance of Manjula mam. she has been a great support from the start and always available for us. Mam is very friendly and encouraging. the way she treats her patients is very comforting. Mam always takes time to explain everything in detail. as this was our first pregnancy mam responded to all our naive questions with great patience and a cute smile. we have already started recommending her to people. the way mam handled some of the concerns just before the delivery was really amazing. we always felt we were under the right guidance.thank youu ma'am!!!",

She without wasting anytime asked me to do a rescan and immediately determined the issue. I conceived again within 2months and since then the journey till my delivery was perfect. She explains every silly doubt of yours without any hesitation. She built my confidence for a normal delivery and finally I did have a normal delivery with her support. I was mentally okay for a c session, but doctor from my 7th month scan kept telling me I will have a normal delivery and stay positive on that. I'm super happy now and all well. I would 100 \u2105 recommend Dr Manjula for anyone. ",

She respected our decision-making process, and after careful consideration, we opted for the surgical treatment she proposed.\n\nThe surgery was performed successfully, and my wife is currently in the good recovery phase.

After 9 years my wife is getting pregnant, and both are very worried. Doctor clearly explained about the situation and step by step she guided us. We strictly followed doctor guidelines and never we didn't follow any \"search engines\" to ask questions. Every visit to the Doctor makes us confident to move for the next few months.\nPast 9 years we never met such an excellent doctor in our journey. I would highly recommend the doctor for Gynaecology.\nRating is just a number, but from the heart I would like to give \"Infinite\" to the Doctor.  \nAfter nine months, our wait is over. \"We are glad to welcome our princess\". Thank you very much, Doctor . ",

Pregnancy can be normal, but after the first pregnancy was c-section and second will be normal is some thing which is tough to believe. But it happened and reason behind is your confidence and guidance. Without you I don\u2019t think it would have been possible.\nThe entire journey from 1st month till delivery you were just superb.\nWe all go to God and pray but some one will believe and some not, but Doctor like you have proved that (Doctors are next to God) \nI again thank you and mother hood hospital, the entire staff.\nAll were so friendly and after 14 years of gap we had a healthy baby.\nGOD BLESS YOU. \n\n\n",

Every visit was great and the doctor\u2019s demeanor has really put me at ease. She takes time to answer questions and provide as much information as possible to ensure I understand what is going on and what the next steps should be. The doctor also helped with the appointment schedule so that our regular work wasn't affected. Also cleared our doubts through WhatsApp when we were unable to come to hospital.\n\nShe also followed up post discharge and enquired about my health condition.\nHighly recommended!",

We were happy with the facility as well, the hospital premises and the room was very hygienic and clean.Food and liquid diet was given time to time by the hospital. I would like to thank Dr. Manjula for taking the utmost care in treating my mother. It has been almost a month now after the surgery and my mother is doing really well. I would recommend Dr. Manjula as she is skilled at what she does and never fails to respond to our queries on her personal number even though she has busy schedules. Thank you for your service doctor.Much obliged!",

As I suffered severe symptoms during the first two trimesters, she was empathetic,\u00a0 answered all queries and addressed the concerns with patience during those testing times.\n\n2. Childbirth:\u00a0 She explained and guided us throughout the process of childbirth. She also supported our requests/preferences during and immediately after the child birth.\n\n3. Staff and Facilities: She has a supportive staff working in a hygienic environment. The hospital stay during childbirth was comfortable. Although, the food served to the patients can be better/healthy.\n\nThank you doctor for being empathetic, supportive, clear in communication and delivering a healthy baby.",

(means again 1 hr I need to wait)\nI don't know what is the point of taking appointments.\nIt's very pathetic that making carrying moms take this long wait for consultation.This is the second experience for me with this same doctor.\nI wasted my  3 hrs time all together today just to meet a Gynecologist.",

It's hard to find a patient-friendly doctor in today's world but Dr Manjula is an exception, I was always thrilled to meet her for consultation during pregnancy. My parents would say I was in the safest pair of hands! My hubby, parents and younger are so happy and overwhelmed while listening to my interactions with Dr Manjula. We are ever grateful and particularly I will cherish all my meetings with her. God bless her abundantly....... ",

She tries her best to opt for normal delivery in all situations.Even the staff at motherhood is really good. the labour room staff are a great motivation, they helped me a lot during contractions. The nurses are also really friendly and approachable. The cleaning staff is also upto mark, they kept cleaning the room every now and then.

She has good knowledge on what medicines to give for what kind of pregnancy and everyone's pregnancy is different and experience is different. We had visited few other well known hospitals as well but the doctors over there were more like robots, didn't care about mother's feelings. But at Motherhood they make sure mother and he family is made comfortable and decisions are taken in  mutual understanding. One more thing to add is you don't get surprises or rather shock when admitted like others do as you are not  in A situation to make decisions. On a closing note, Dr Manjula mam was like our Google map, even if we missed a turn she would get back us to the track to reach our destination. Thank you all who helped usbin our journey.",

Throughout the pregnancy, my queries related to illnesses that I had were promptly answered and I always could count on her to guide me correctly. She even took the trouble to ask me how I was when I was in pain during a fibroid related issue. \nWe were able to go through a normal delivery with her care as she is someone who stays calm n collected when it matters. I could put my trust completely in her to deliver our child safely. We will be always grateful for how she made our pregnancy journey a beautiful one with her excellent care and sense of humor. ",

She is very friendly ,approachable and most importantly explains everything in detail. She really spends time with all her patients , ensures all their doubts are cleared. \nUnfortunately I was tested Covid positive along with my family just few days before my EDD. It was a whole lot of stress and panic. I immediately spoke to Doctor and she reassured me and gave me the strength which was so very important at that time. She confidentially promised me that every arrangement will be made and everything will be done safely. Like a friend, like a family she messaged me time to time to check if I was ok and counseled me. I had to undergo c section the next day. My baby was born with no complications and everything went so smoothly. Once again thank you to Doctor for the mental support and taking care of me so well. \nThank you so much .",

Her approach to a patient is really something I admired, a lot. She made us comfortable, showed compassion and made us feel that we are important and she is concerned about our well-being. First she requested the history of the patient and suggests tests and medication required and then proceeds with the treatment which is both important and necessary. The best thing about her is her behavior and the way she explains (in very simple language as we or anybody who isn\u2019t a doctor would not understand the medical terminologies) where the problem is and what we need to do resolve it. We really thank her for everything. * ***** ** ** *** ** ** **** **** *** ** *** **** ************ * ********* Sunanda & Ranjan",

The Dr is vastly experienced and the visits throughout the pregnancy are smooth, caring and with a personal touch. Her treatment and suggestions are on point and precise and really helpful. One should follow her process and the results are there to see as a byproduct. She has helped us deliver a perfectly normal delivery.The best thing with Dr. Manjula is that she really enjoys humour and participates in them too which makes the whole experience a lot happier and worth remembering.I would strongly recommend Dr Manjula to everyone. We have thoroughly enjoyed the whole pregnancy duration with her. Thanks to Dr. Manjula",

She spends enough time with her patients (no hurry) and makes sure all the issues are understood and clarified. She makes you smile every time you visit. Her knowledge and experience, personal touch with her patients and her approach is commendable. She had assured normal delivery on our first visit and voila it was a normal delivery:) I whole heartedly thank Dr. Manjula for making this journey such a pleasant one. - Amina",

We got scared and tensed as any parent-to-be would be. That's when we went to motherhood and met Dr. Manjula. She explained about the complication in-depth and gave us positivity and confidence to carry on with the pregnancy one week at a time. She is tremendously experienced, calm, polite, patient and answered each and every question that we had. Ultimately, she delivered our baby through normal delivery. Both mum and baby are healthy and all is well. We are so glad to have her as our doctor. I couldn't thank you enough doc \ud83d\ude42.",

I had C- section and with Dr.Manjula being a big support involved, the entire process was smooth and the delivery was sucessfull. The babies are also fine. I completely recommend Dr.Manjula for any OBJ care that anyone might require. Moreover, she doesnt make you feel like it is a hospital and you are the patient. Thats the main thing I love. ",

It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I feel today Motherhood is having good reputation in hospitality because of Dr. Manjula. \n\nComing to administration, I would say it is not upto the mark. There are no proper communication given to the Patient or Patient companion. Food services are good and house keeping has done an wonderful job in taking care of the Patient from day 1. \n\nOnce again, Hats off to Dr. Manjula S Patil who helped me deliver a healthy baby.

And even ovaries and tubes were removed vaginally.. This surgery is one of the complicated procedure and Dr Manjula, being an expert in performing such procedures gave us confidence and it was successful as promised. Now my mother in law is doing fine after the surgery. We also had a follow-up consultation a week after, she is recovering quicker than expected!Thanks to Dr Manjula ",

In my 9th month scan two loops of umbilical cord was seen around my baby's neck, and many people suggested we go for a c-section. But with the help and encouragement of doctor I was still able to have a vaginal delivery. All thanks to the doctor for this. It's her friendly and positive nature that helped us believe her/trust her completely and take the risk of trying for vaginal delivery with two loops around the neck. \nEven post delivery when I was facing some post delivery issues, and I ping her she would immediately respond in a positive way.

As soon as she got to know my condition she only approached the hospital to start doing the delivery of covid patient, accordingly they made all the arrangements and delivery was done safely.

Initially we were little anxious, but once we met her, we felt like it was our best decision. She is one of the most approachable and builds a positive vibes. As this was our first delivery, she understood my concerns and answered to all questions patiently. Though we didn't had full hopes on normal delivery, she is the one who motivated us for normal delivery. Overall my delivery experience is happy and pleasant. I would like to thank  doctor from bottom of my heart . I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a safe and happy delivery.",

She also tried and prepared me for my normal delivery as I had expressed that I would like to go for the same. We had a good normal delivery experience towards the end.

We were under a lot of mental pressure due to the approaching Pregnancy. The Doctor whom we were earlier consulting seemed to be adamant on performing a C-section without much explanation. We went to Manjula ma'am for second opinion. She immediately put all our concerns to rest. She did a very skilled diagnosis and explained us everything in Laymen terms. \n\nOn 24/6/20 we were blessed with a Baby girl. It was normal Delivery.\n\nI keep thanking my stars for going to Manjua ma'am for a second opinion. I can\u2019t thank her enough for the on time, prompt and professional advice.\n",

She will explain the problem in details and then will give a solution with a smile. I believe doctor also play a large part to have a healthy baby which we are expecting by God grace.\n\nThank you Manjula for the experience.

During our first consultation, she explained to us the stages that one goes through this process, the expectations we should have in the coming months and the mindset with which we should approach the journey.  \n\nAll throughout Dr. Patil addressed our concerns keeping our best interest in mind and instilled confidence in us, which helped us have a full term baby by normal delivery. \n\nShe was always accessible over the phone and was prompt in her response to our queries. Her patience with us made our pregnancy journey comfortable, for which we shall forever be grateful to her.\n\nWe would highly recommend Dr. Manjula Patil to anyone looking for an experienced OB-GYN. Her positive attitude, practical approach and calm demeanor will put you at ease and help you have a wonderful and healthy pregnancy.",

The first trimester of my pregnancy was very smooth but in the 15th week I was daignosed with Placenta Previa due to which there was multiple episodes of Antepartum Haemorrhage.It was an high risk pregnancy so I was very much concerned and stressed due to my medical condition.In my 2nd Trimester I met Dr. Manjula. Dr. Manjula came as a blessing during my pregnancy journey. She handled all the risks involved in my pregnancy very efficiently. She also addressed all my concerns as per my satisfaction even the trivial ones.Her friendly approach gives a comfort to discuss any issues or concerns going in ones mind.Mine was an elective C section and I delivered a baby girl on 28th October 2021. Dr. Manjula was also very flexible with the delivery date and timings. She made sure that the delivery could happen on the timing and date decided by me.After C Section the recovery was also very faster only because of the proper care under Dr. Manjula.I highly recommend Dr. Manjula S Patil for ones pregnancy journey.",

Her friendly nature and ever smiling face gives a very positive feeling when ever we meet her. Doctor is very approachable,  extremely patient and explains every single detail. Even during delivery, doctor was so patient and tried 100% for normal delivery until the last minute. She had clearly mentioned what will be the process and if vaginal delivery is possible a month back. Overall I had a great experience with Dr Manjula. She made my entire pregnancy journey very smooth and memorable. I would definitely recommend Dr Manjula to anyone who is looking for pregnancy care.",

The best decision to consult Doctor Manjula Patil.. Everybody took care of me and the baby as if we are all a family. Also to mention I had delivered my baby before the provided expected date of delivery I must say the doctor was very helpful to do it as normal delivery and I was recovered the same day of delivery.. Me and my family are very happy and would highly recommend to visit Dr Manjula Patil at mother hood..\n\nOverall an awesome experience at this hospital\nWill definitely recommend this hospital to others :)",

She advised for the healthy diet chart which begets the outcome of levelled sugar. \n\nAlso, with the routing follow up she was always suggestive to get a better approach about delivery. She assured the chances of normal delivery and made it smoothly. \n\nA thank you note would not be sufficient for how obliged we are but KUDOS to Dr Manjula and the team. \n \nI will recommend her to every pregnant lady for the best health care support.

While we started browsing for alternatives, we came across Dr Manjula's profile which also indicated they had practiced in St Philomena which instantly gave us confidence to meet this Dr.   And from there, she has been nothing but a blessing to us and never short of God to us in many ways. Dr Manjula is more concerned and well prepared to have a normal delivery and she is breaking those records in Motherhood. We are also blessed that Dr Manjula successfully did Vaginal birth after cesarean. If you are one of those Mother's who is determined to have a Normal delivery, please meet Dr Manju.Those who are in confusion of Choosing the Gynaecologist, Dr Manjula is the go to person. ",

She ensured that we are in safe hands and given the confidence that normal delivery is 100% possible when other doctors said chances for normal delivery are only 50%. At the end it was a normal delivery and Manjula was supporting us throughout till discharge. We are 200% happy with doctors professionalism, concern and care towards us.

Doctor explained clearly all the possible scenarios that could cause the above symptom  and guided me properly from the first consultation. My case was quite complex as it was ectopic pregnancy and the pregnancy needs to be terminated  but she guided us through proper  step by step procedure and we were  able to achieve it in medical management. She explained each and every possible scenario how the treatment will happen, at the initial stages only so that we were well aware of our situation. She was supportive and  she even came to the scan room and consulted with other doctor  to understand my situation better. Overall I was totally satisfied and I would recommend the doctor to anyone I know.",

Her friendly, supportive nature made us move on during that critical period. There was a situation , we were not sure if it will exceeded after 29weeks but as per the guidance from manjula madam, we took a next step n finally blessed with healthy mature baby princess in our life after 38th week. We are really happy for the support we received from manjula madam. Thanks a ton! You added one more precious bundle of joy in our life :)",
