None,None,0,0,YES,We consulted Dr. Suguna throughout our pregnancy journey. She diagnosed my thyroid issues and provided with proper pre pregnancy care which helped us conceive within 2 months. She was very empathetic and kind throughout our pregnancy. She was available whenever there was a query or emergency.  Her emotional support during my delivery helped with my anxiety. Overall our experience with the doctor is very good.,2024-08-05 15:45:05,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

None,None,0,0,NO,"We already have had a healthy issue 6 years ago and visited Dr. Suguna for my wife's second pregnancy. Everything went well for the initial 6 months but unfortunately , the scans detected an anomaly in the foetus due to which we had to terminate the pregnancy. We were not really happy with the way she behaved in the labour room and even complained about this to the Apollo Cradle management. We did not follow up on the action taken on her as we were in grief of losing our unborn child. However, I would not recommend her to anyone.   ",2022-12-09 11:24:25,False,False,Manish Mathur,,,
None,"Vaginal Infection Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I had gone for medical advice on a ****** infection. After finding out that I am 34 , married and  I do not have kids, the first thing she said was - You should have already had atleast 1 kid by now. I told her politely that at this stage, my husband and I do not want . She went ahead with the check up and again started lecturing me to have kids. I again told her that we donâ€™t want right now. Then she started asking about any family history of diseases and when I told her that my father is a diabetic, she again said that you should have a kid before you get diabetes. I was shocked!! 
So in 5 minutes, she tried to coax me 3 times instead of focusing on the issue I was visiting her for. ** ***** **** *** *** *** ** ********** ** ** ******** ****** * *** ** ** **** * *** ******* ** *** ** ******* *** *** ********** ********.
