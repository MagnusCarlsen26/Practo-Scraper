We tried consulting 5 doctors to find the right one. Based on the feedback in practo, our conversation with her, care taking nature and data of practo such as her super strong recommendation, reviews ( count and recency) we chose her for pregnancy. I can say now that the decision to consult her was extremely right.  

My feedback on her care is; she raises in her customer obsession, **************** and capability in taking right judgement. We have seen at least 8 gynaecologist in Gujarat,  Bangalore (Marathahalli and Rajajinagar suburbs) *** *** ** *** *****

We always have consulted at her own clinic rather the hospitals she visits. Timings are very comfortable. We got very good personalized experience over there. Unlike big hospitals, you can save a lot of time and struggle to find the places and dealing with queues ( I got fed up previously). Also the place is in proximity of diagnostic labs and imaging centers. Her consultation charges are quite reasonable and worth of each penny. I found her highly professional and  prescribe right and only required medication and scans.

Actually we took her advice for second kid on prepragnancy. She always provided us sufficient time. Takes notes, listen well and answers all queries. Provides adequate time for case descriptions and checkup. Handle patient awesomely with both positive and negative motivation at the right time. Have some patience and you can see the best judgement and command over the advises and consultation. She strictly follows ethics and taken right trade off considering risks and suggested vaginal or c-section for delivery. I would strongly suggest you to save brain and just follow what she says. 

Today my wife successfully delivered the baby at late night (at 11.35). Delivery was super smooth. Post delivery, she didn’t rush to go home despite of late night. She did post operating checks. She also had a check over baby and if that gets mother’s feeding or not etc. This is exceptional and give you trust on having your wife and baby in right hand. 

I would also like to thank Practo for super reliable platform for finding such doctors. If practo allows, will have an update after a week with more details. Till the date, I am 200% satisfied and strongly recommended to consult her without any dilemma.",2017-10-07 21:36:53,False,True,Paras,Thanks for the feedback.

She provided us the best care and attention throughout my pregnancy.

From the day 1 of my visit with her, I never felt talking to a stranger. The doctor is very friendly, kind, caring, has lots of patience, listens to all your silly questions and answers all of them in the way you can understand. She prescribes right things at the right time. No unnecessary scans; no unnecessary blood tests. At the same time, never missed any necessary scans or tests. She has done the best that my baby and I need. I am very thankful to the Doctor for being very supportive throughout my journey of pregnancy.

Whenever I get worried of some pregnancy symptoms, the doctor was always there to support and clarify what it is and why I have got. Every consultation with her was a very good experience, that when leaving her clinic, I come out very lighthearted. 

I was desperate to have normal delivery and Dr.Bhanu made my dream come true. From the time I got admitted in the hospital, the doctor was always there whenever required giving her personal attention. For every 2 hours, she was following up with the nursing staff even at the midnight. Next day, early in the morning, she was right there at the hospital to check on the progress. Every minute of my labor, doctor was there next to me, with her motivational words. She made me feel safe, cared for, and comfortable. 

The confidence she gave me on the labor bed was phenominal. She spent more than 2 hours standing next to me in the labor room helping me deliver the baby safe. She guided me and helped me push the baby right. No words match to express my gratitude for the doctor. I enjoyed every moment of my labor and relish it now as well..  All this is because of Dr.Bhanu's supervision.

Even post delivery, she gave time to check on the baby and mother's feed. She personally called me after couple of days to check on the baby's health and my health (I had postpartum edema - swollen legs) and suggested medications over the call. That is the care she has for her patients. 

The Doctor is a cute little Angel in disguise with incredible ability and potential.

We are super satisfied with the doctor and very strongly recommend her :) ",2018-02-19 09:14:03,False,True,Mahalakshmi,,,

During this time she did advice me in all the worries  i come across and even she supported after clinic hours and i still i reconcile she asked us to visit for check up at the very early morning when i had a worry and which was bothered me.
My labor-delivery was well scheduled with the consent from Dr.Bhanu ma’m and i had normal delivery which was indeed by Dr.Bhanu ma’m.
