"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"At the very first visit of my pregnancy check i became more comfortable.
Dr.Bhanu ma‚Äôm was so kind and with patience she clarified all our queries.
I was still going to the work until 7th month and she was kind with the flexible appointments and so much supportive over the months.
Regular follow up schedules, insisted us to get scannings and tests done at right time.
During this time she did advice me in all the worries  i come across and even she supported after clinic hours and i still i reconcile she asked us to visit for check up at the very early morning when i had a worry and which was bothered me.
My labor-delivery was well scheduled with the consent from Dr.Bhanu ma‚Äôm and i had normal delivery which was indeed by Dr.Bhanu ma‚Äôm. 
Post delivery ma‚Äôm followed up with me many times and visited multiple times to check wellbeing of baby and me.
All i got from consulting ma‚Äôm is.......
Positive feel during pregnancy 
Proper diet plan 
Became more comfortable and confidence with regular tests
Normal delivery. 
Thanks a ton ma‚Äôm...
