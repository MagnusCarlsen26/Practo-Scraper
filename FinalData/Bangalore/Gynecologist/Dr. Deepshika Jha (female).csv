As the lock down started, I had tough time to meet my previous doctor, who was taking care of me previously. I got to know that my previous doctor had just closed her hospital and she was away and not meeting any of her patients due to Covid 19, I, infact tried to reach many other doctors in RT Nagar , Bangalore, but everyone was scared to give appointment, all the doctors I spoke were giving online appointment. 

And in the mean time I came across Dr. Deepshikha Jha, she was the only one who gave me an appointment, she did meet me face to face and got me admitted as I was really not well. 

Dr. Deepshikha Jha is a very brave and a very responsible Doctor, though the Country was locked down and there was fear of Covid 19 everywhere, she never hesitated to meet me fave to face, She is very friendly and ready to help her patients. Even in the lock down I never had any problem for appointment and regular check ups. 

She is very positive in her nature and also shares lot of positivity with her patients. It helped me a lot to relieve the stress and stay relaxed all the time. 

In case of emergency Dr. Deepshikha Jha was just a call away. 

She is the only doctor I would strongly recommend.
