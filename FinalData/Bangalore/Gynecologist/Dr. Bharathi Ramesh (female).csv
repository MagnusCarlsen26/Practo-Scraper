I visited Dr Bharthi Ramesh when I was in my 8 month pregnancy, but initially was very skeptical on how she would handle my twin pregnancy as we choose Dr Bharthi Ramesh based on the reviews and recommendations on Practo.
But hands down, I am happy to say we made the right choice.
She is very calm and composed and handled my high risk twin pregnancy with such ease.
From day one of my consultation I immediately was very comfortable and confident of not going to have premature pregnancy. 
With her insights and direction I was able to successfully complete 37 weeks and delivered healthy twins.  And the silver lining was that not having to keep my twins in ICU.
She never treated my case as a high risk pregnancy, I cannot imagine a more supportive, brilliant OBG.
