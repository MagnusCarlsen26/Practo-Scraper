I did not consult for pregnancy however I had a few questions in my mind related to dieseases in women and also the fees that doctors charge for just checking your report.  It’s sad that an educated lady doctor should behave rudely with her patients. Being the daughter of a cancer victim I get scared while visiting any doctor and that gives rise to many questions in my mind and I tend to ask them just be more informed. When I pay a doctor I expect them to give me a reassurance and not negative vibes. Being educated means humility and gentle attitude towards someone with a problem. If you are a patient like me then you certainly don’t deserve a doctor like Ms.Rathi. I was literally in tears after my consultation only because of her behaviour.

We are in digital India where cloudnine doctors prefer to use paper and make a big fuss of it if not available. Moreover her tone was very rude. Such behavior impacts patient's health further. There is no trust on a person behaving like this. Doctor's are preferred to be polite and willing to hear the patient and make them comfortable. I can tell you making comfortable is far off rather she disturbed me more due to her rude behavior. Last thing I expected from cloud nine.
