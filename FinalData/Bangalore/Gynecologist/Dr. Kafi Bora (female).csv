"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Writing Reviews is a job which I don't like until its worth and this is WORTH **** ** *** *** **** ****** ** ***********We are staying in BTM 2nd Stage, Bengaluru & hence visiting nearby Rainbow Hospital in Bannerghatta was convenient for my wife's regular pregnancy checkups. 
Its hell of a job and a daunting task of finding a doctor in this kind of scenarios, who can assure you that don't worry I am there. That is where we found Dr Kafi Bora in Practo, we were bit dicy when we visited her 1st time as this is totally a new horizon of experience for young parents (Woruld be :) yuppyyy). In the 1st visit She ensured that she answered all our queries considering we were first time anxious parents (when ofcourse your wife ask you so many questions make you realize why haven't you done MBBS) 
One of the smoothest Journeys we had from April 16 till Jan 17 and I am always thankful to Dr Kafi for all the family friend like attitude, soft spokenness, patience, understanding nature, personal care/touch for my wife and baby. During the pregnancy and regular checkups, she monitored the baby and mother very closely. She also ask to call any time if need help which is rare, in between the pregnancy we had to travel for few days and instead of us calling her she use to call us and get reports settled. 
After months of regular check-ups finally when the time arrived we were very scared to opt between normal delivery or C-section (Really when my wife is so scared of even injections and this is a new life entering a new world). She really helped us understand the pros and cons of both types of delivery. We opted for normal delivery via induced labour (Were waiting almost for Whole night till next day afternoon) but it didn't workout for us and we decided to go for c sec as advised by her. For me I was so nervous about the c sec procedure and as soon as I saw my wife entering the delivery room, I started feeling cold & nervous. She made me understand that I need not worry everything is going to fine. 
After all this drama :), we were blessed with healthy baby boy. Thanks a lot Doctor for all those smiles on our face, Any one should not have any doubt in mind or second thought to visit her.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Doctor is extremely polite , humble and expert in her profession.
She listens to patient carefully and explains the situation meticulously.
We start visiting her when my wife was 7th month pregnant and under her guidance and support, my wife delivered a healthy baby girl with Normal Delivery.
During the long delivery time from evening 6 to next day morning 3am, Dr Kafi not only encouraged my wife but also waited patiently and sleeplessly till morning 3 for the labor pain.
I would highly recommend her for any pregnancy related issues and rate her skills 10/10.
Thank you again Dr Kafi!

None,None,0,0,NO,I visited the doctor to get my Anomaly scan done. The doctor was very rude and literally shouting asking me to get my hands off my tummy and that it was her area. She could have conveyed the same in a normal tone. Also during the scan I had to inform her that she is taking the screenshots of my report under the previous patient’s name and not under my name. **** ** *** ************ ** **** ******. *** ****** *** ***** ***** ** *** ** ****** **** * *******. We are paying for her time and she is responsible to behave accordingly. I did not pay her to get scolded by her. ******* *** ******* ********** ** **** ** ****** ***** **** **** ** ** *********. Would never recommend her to anyone. ,2023-11-01 20:35:24,False,False,Verified Patient,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"The moment i came to know that, when i am carrying the twins, my search is started to find a good doctor. My search is ended when i met the Dr. Kafi Bora. I had a great time when ever I visited Dr. Kafi Bora. She had been taken the very much care of myself and my twin babies.
