"Doctor friendliness,","Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,YES,"No issues with the doctor. However major issues with the staff.
This was my second visit to the hospital. I went to show my blood test report to Dr. Praveena Shenoy. When I visited for the first time back in March, the doctor had advised me to get these tests done and walk in without prior appointment as is the norm. I even called before visiting to ensure I didn't need an appointment and they confirmed the same. After I reached, I was told by the receptionist that I would need to pay for the visit since I didn't go back with the reports within a week's time since my first consultation. Now this was totally new for me as I wasn't informed of any such policy at the time of my first visit. After 45 minutes of waiting and speaking with multiple people, including the OP in charge, Ms./Dr. Tulika, I was told I would need to pay even though it was a miss on the hospital's side to apprise me of this policy. Totally disgruntled and frustrated I had no other option but to pay since I didn't want to spend time any further.A couple of fellow patients also expressed their irritation with the staff and the way they handled ""customers"" (I was shocked to hear the staff there addressing us as customers/clients). Their grim and stern faces added up to my misery. They weren't one bit apologetic about their blunder for which they made me go through all of this.
Had it not been for Dr. Shenoy, I would have never ever visited cloud nine again. I would not recommended anyone to visit this branch ever just because of the staff.",2019-04-24 05:05:35,False,True,Nikita Patel Baid,,,

"Wait time,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"Like many others I was very keen and excited to be consulted by Dr Praveena for my first pregnancy. Also because she was my sister-in-law's doctor as well and she handled her pregnancy very nicely. So in spite of long waiting hours,difficulty in getting an appointment and that she isn't easily available (over phone, only email) I still went ahead to consult her for my pregnancy. 
First trimester was ok. In one of my blood reports of  2nd trimester my RBC count was touching the borderline . On highlighting this to her assistant doctors, she dismissed it stating that it was normal. For her assistant doctor everything's ok and Dr Shenoi hardly noticed it as she spends only few secs per patient. So I didn't bother at that point of time as I thought it was ok. 
But it was not because this triggered in my 3rd trimester. On having severe body itching Dr Shenoi advised for a test and when the test report was not ok. she advised me to consult endocrinologist and refer her name. however I couldnt get through the endocrinologist as he was busy for next two days. I referred another endocrinologist  wherein I  was diagnosed with HELLP Syndrome with ICP. during this time my health was deteriorating and due to an emergency I was admitted to Apollo. When the docs there mentioned that my condition was critical and will have to go for an emergency c section . There could be a possibility of platelet transfusion as well. I contacted cloudnine emergency section.I couldn't get through Dr Shenoi. Somehow I get the contact number of Dr Shenoi and i msg her the whole situation and ask her for her advice. Only response ""All the best"". Post delivery at Apollo I sent emails to her with reports and my condition. No response. No follow up. 

Is that what doctors are for? To leave your patient when she needed you.
Not expected. Hence please beware when consulting her. 
Also Cloudnine is not a multi speciality clinic. You have to consult different doctors should some complication arise. Also its not well equipped to handle emergencies. Baby will be fine but god forbid any complication arise for mother she is transferred to nearby hospital. 
So my sincere request to all please consult Dr Shenoi at your own risk.",2017-02-08 09:47:16,False,False,PRAGYA,,,

Surgery was done. Next day my blood tests were done and my haemoglobin had fell down to 4 and i was not given any blood transfusion but iron shots the following day. Due to lack of blood i found it difficult to breathe and breathlessness was there for following 2-3 weeks and headaches for couple of months which went away as my health improved. After surgery i kept complaining of pain on left side (my left tube was removed) and kept asking doctor the reasons during my successive visits but she kept saying it will be fine and there was nothing to worry.
