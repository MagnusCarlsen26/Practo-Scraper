We recently shifted to Bangalore (during 7th month of pregnancy of my wife) and was unsure about the Gynaecologist within our vicinity. Earlier we started consulting with one of the renown doctor who left the hospital (which we chose for delivery) when my wife had completed 8 months and it was difficult for us at that moment to change the doctor again so temporarily we had to consult Dr. Sri Vidya and in first meeting only we realized that God has chosen her to help us at that critical moment and we decided to have the delivery in same hospital by her only. She gave answers to all our silly answers very patiently with smile, gave time to understand each and every issue and took care of my wife right from the beginning till baby was delivered normally. She encouraged my wife to deliver the baby normally when my wife was loosing patience due to pain and we also thought to go ahead with C-Section. I would strongly recommend her for any gynae related issues. Thank you very much Doctor :)",
