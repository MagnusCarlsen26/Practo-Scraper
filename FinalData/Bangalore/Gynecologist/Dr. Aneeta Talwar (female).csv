"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Myomectomy,Pregnancy,Breast Examination,",0,0,YES,"I was Dr. Aneeta Talwar's patient twice. One was back in September 2021 where I was diagnosed with a large fibroid of about 15-20cm and I had to undergo myomectomy. While all other doctors, I consulted for second third opinions literally freaked out looking a the size of the fibroid, Dr. Talwar was confident that it can be treated well and I am happy to say that she did an amazing job. Explained all the possible precautions and risks very well. The second time I went to see her was for my pregnancy. I delivered a baby in 2024. My experience for those 38 weeks was nothing but phenomenal.  It was a high risk pregnancy and she did her best to be ahead of those risks.She is very efficient at her job and does whatever is the best treatment for her patients. The best part about consulting her is that she won't sugar-coat situations. Instead she will be straightforward, practical and objective in her treatment. I am really thankful to her for the kind of emotional support she provided me during my delivery and myomectomy in the OT. She is an amazing and wonderful doctor. Thank you Dr. Aneeta Talwar for being so objective, detailed, practical, result oriented and thorough.",2024-04-29 01:01:35,False,True,Richa Mishra,,,
