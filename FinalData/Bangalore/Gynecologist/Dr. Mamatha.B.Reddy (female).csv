It was my first ever visit to a gyno and my level of consciousness was long forgotten seeing the poor/unorganised condition of the hospital. Most importantly, the appointment I scheduled through practo was cancelled, As the receptionist informed they had closed online appointments...I had to take a fresh appointment and wait for about over an hour. The receptionist took forever. She was so lost that she had forgotten I paid the amount I had to. Instead, she asked me to stay back insisting the same is pending. While I was forced to put down my foot and plainly mention "" I am leaving""  although I didnt intend to be rude. I had the receipt she printed out for me. Special mentions to the toilet which was in no way to be considered a toilet fit for a multi speciality hospital where, hygiene is primary. I had to demand for the toilet paper and explain it's a mandate in a hospital while the nurse told me "" Sorry madam, we have no tissues."" which left me astound. I have a photograph of the toilet if I have to attach it. I believe this hospital and its services are over rated on practo and they should re consider the ratings.
