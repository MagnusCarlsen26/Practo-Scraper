"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"Our experience with Dr. Shobana had been awesome. Me and wife had started visiting Shobana madam for my wife's first pregnancy in February, and my wife delivered a healthy baby recently in October 2019.

Dr Shobana mam really looked into my wife case extremely well, she was always there for my wife's queries and for any emergencies.
I think it's madam's personal connect and care that helped my wife to recover and heal fast.

My wife's case was a critical one because of her past medical history, but with Dr. Shobana everything went so perfect, that we have no words to express it.

Dr. Shobana mam is so caring and punctual, I remember the night my wife delivered, she went into labour around midnight, we assumed from our past experiences with other doctors that we can go to hospital and doctor will arrive in sometime. We were surprised to see that doctor is there before us and she is eagerly waiting for her patient, to know how is she now?

We have meet a lot of doctors but with Dr. Shobana everything is so cool and relaxed. 

Thanks Dr Shobana mam for all your care for my wife and new born. Also, a big thanks to Sir and your team for all the support and care.
