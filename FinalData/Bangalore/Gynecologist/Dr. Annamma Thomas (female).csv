Very patient doctor especially when you have lots of doubts and also if you want to clarify myths coming from your ancestors (For Eg. We had a doubt if we can consume saffron during pregnancy to have a fair baby, doctor said if you like the taste, go ahead else it doesn't make any difference. To be on a safer side, I didn't allowed my wife to consume the saffron, and we are now blessed with a fair baby)

The delivery was normal only because of the this Doctor, we all gave up because my wife could not bear the pain, but till last minute doctor was keeping us motivated by saying that my wife is progressing well and can deliver baby soon. Though it was a tough time during the labor pain, all the pain did not go in vain and finally my wife delivered a baby with a normal procedure.
