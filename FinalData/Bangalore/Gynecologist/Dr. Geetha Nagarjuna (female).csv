"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Prenatal Checkup,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Hi..Meet me Bharath & my wife Pallavi, yet another Software Engineer working for Big IT firms. When it comes to choosing Doctors, we always tend to go for a known Doctors. Same was with our case. We were doing Hit Refresh after 5 years. We have a son who is 5 years old. I am native of Davangere and as the schools were all online mode due to COVID, we kind off shifted to Davangere. It was December when my wife gave good news of our second pregnancy. We were doing all the regular check-ups with our known Dr. Divakar and everything was going well.

How did we meet Dr Geetha Nagarjun?

As the schools started and everything was offline, we shifted back to Bengaluru. It was June 24th; we were all set for our New Housewarming ceremony and my wife was 31 weeks pregnant. On that day my wife started bleeding. For a moment, my whole body became cold, and I was clueless on what had to be done. I quickly called up Dr. Divakar and explained the situation to him. He took some time and called me back and asked me to rush to MotherHood hospital near Devegowda Petrol Bunk and meet Dr. Geetha Nagarjun. He had met her during one of the conferences. Dr Divakar had informed Geetha with our situation. We asked our parents to carry on with the Housewarming pooja and we both started towards MotherHood hospital. It was close to 7kms from our House. Lots of negative thoughts going in our mind and not sure what will happen next. We reached the hospital around 7:30AM, Dr Geetha had already informed at the reception, and we were rushed to first floor for scanning. During the scan, the baby’s heartbeat and movements were normal and it gave a sigh of relief for us. Because of Dr. Geetha we didn’t go through the hassle of doing the registration at the Hospital until things got stabilized. My wife was admitted and was kept for observation for 4 days. In these 4 days, the only question that was going through my mind was “What If”. Dr Geetha explained to me about all the pros and cons and her aim was to put her under observation and see that we can push the delivery by couple of weeks as nothing can replace mother’s womb for baby’s development. Every day they used to scan and see the progress. On day 1, there was bleeding with adequate liquor. Day2, clots were gone, and liquor had reduced. Humans are prone to errors. Dr Geetha didn’t want to take a chance. She wanted to take a third opinion from a different radiologist and this time everything was normal, and we were discharged. She advised my wife to take complete bed rest.

Post Meeting Dr Geetha
MotherHood has a clinic in Kanakapura Main Road and Dr Geetha comes for consultation into that clinic. We had our regular checkups there and luckily my wife was able to complete 38 weeks of pregnancy. When the due date is nearing, the questions that come to everybody’s mind: will it be Normal or ‘C’ Section. Dr Geetha did her due diligence and suggested us for a C-Section. When it comes to our Indian tradition, given an option we always pick a date and time for good things to happen. Similarly, we fixed it for Aug 15th between 12 PM to 2:30 PM. Dr Geetha was very accommodative to do the delivery during this time. Every story should have a happy ending. On Aug 15th, we were blessed with a little angel.
 
Dr Geetha Nagarjun was great in both handling the complication that we faced and in delivering us our little princess. Dr Geetha is not just a very good as a doctor but is empathetic as well. She has very good experience despite being so young. All her suggestions & directions given throughout the last trimester journey helped us sail through the pregnancy & delivery at ease.
My wife was highly concerned about the delivery process and post-delivery pain & recovery. But, with Dr. Geetha’s support this phase was comfortable.
Thank you Dr. Geetha for Everything.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Myself Ashwini I just need to share my experience with Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna who is currently in motherhood hospital- banashankari. I was carrying twins due to covid pandemic i changed doctor as there was no proper response for regular checkup and later on my friends suggestion met Dr. Geetha on my 5th month of pregnancy. She is good hearted person with amazing smile always on her face, she clears very patiently even a small doubt asked numbers of times through phone or in person. I made right choice of choosing her. As i had cervical stitch in 3rd month from previous doctor, I use to say I need C-Section because of twins, need of NICU care and cervical stitch but Dr. Geetha encouraged me saying that she can try for normal delivery though it is twins with cervical stitch with complete bed rest.  At 36 weeks, around 2AM at home my water bag broke, called Dr. Geetha she asked us to come immediately to hospital. Dr Geetha came immediately to see me at 3am. I remember she said I was only 1cm dilated and not in labour. She removed my cervical stitch. She inserted gel to increase my labour pains, as I had leaked most of the water at home. Dr Geetha said by inserting gel, pain will increase, and chances r there for normal delivery. Within half an hour I had excruciating pain and me and my family asked for C-Section as I couldnot bear pains. Dr Geetha convinced me  and councelled to go for epidural. I took Epidural analgesia. Later my pains completely reduced. I had a Painless NORMAL DELIVERY for TWINS.  She did it and helped me achieve my bundle of joy.  I had a healthy male baby weighing 2.8kg at 11:55am, healthy female baby weighing 2.5kg at 12:04pm in may 2020. Though Dr Geetha had 3months old baby she was with me throughout my labour from 3am to 1:30pm and gave me lots of courage and extremely so supportive.. I was surprised to see someone with so much dedication towards her patients. I feel lucky in that way. I heard many are going for c section because of pandemic. Though I was on shorter side ( 5 feet), with cervical stitch with twins, water bag broke with all this I had normal delivery.  
Patience that Dr geetha kept during delivery is really appreciated. I would suggest all my friends and others to go for Dr Geetha Nagarjuna.  Thank you so much Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for so much caring and responsibility as i felt Iam with my own family. Especially during these COVID times, it was an absolute blessing to have a doctor like her by my side.

We (me and my hubby) decided to undertake this awesome journey together with the Motherhood and I must say that this has been the best decision so far. Like all other 1st time parents, we were having lots of doubts, confusions and curiosity about the parenthood, But as they say that when you have doubts, pray to God and go with the flow. We selected Motherhood and Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna based on google reviews and it was the best thing that we did. She is an amazing and humble doctor we have met so far. She is very transparent, passionate and approachable. We consulted her from day 1 and our journey with her has been incredible. She guided me so well regarding diet, exercises n everything regarding pregnancy. She is very approachable & directly available on calls and whatsapp for all queries/concerns 24x7 even in her hectic schedule, you will be surprised at the super quick responses you get each time from her don't recall having any troubled thoughts later. Whenever we visit hospital she welcomes with her warm smile and whatever doubt we ask she used to guide us even for small questions.
Regaring labour, seriously we were so tensed because baby weight was 3.8kg and we have lost the hope about normal delivery but Geetha mam given confidence in us and we have delivered (normal) healthy boy baby. Geetha mam specialist in that, Honestly telling in the beginning we have thought that who has insurance they will end up with c-section but our prediction was wrong it is not that whether you have insurance or not, it's completely depends on baby position.
We strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna, we have to do what she suggests then everything will be all right. Thank you Dr
Geetha Nagarjuna mam.
To add thanks to Dr. Lissy who helped during labour and the support staff, Nurse, house keeping Aunty, I would definitely like to extend my thanks to the entire team of Motherhood Banashankari and MH Kanakpura clinic for ensuring the smooth transition to the new role of Parenthood and making it memorable from time to time by organizing few celebrations and learning sessions.

Doctor is true Professional in her approach and have a very calm and intelligent way of handling all the situation and gave the best output.

I and my mom met Dr. (Geetha nagarjuna) she is incredible. Not only has she taken great care towards my mom surgery of uterus removal,  but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!

I would personally like to explain about my mom situation, we got to know 4years back, that mom  had a Fibroids in the uterus, god's grace she dint suffer the stomach ache, but slowly she got all the side effects, seviour pain in knee and toe, trust us we met all the fine doctors in the city, and everyone said to get the fibroid removed through the major surgery, as mom had already crossed 40+ , she kept on postponed to avoid surgery at this age ...

When we finally decided to undergo the surgery, we again got one more reference and went to Dr.geetha nagarjun,
with the first appointment itself, she gave lots of hope and gave us lots of confidence about the surgery, after all the tests done she said she can do it through laproscopy instead of major surgery, wi should really thank her from the bottom of my heart,
The operation which we postponed for 4 years , finally when Dr.Geetha gave us a hope of laproscopy surgery , we dint gave a second thought, and we made the surgery done within a week,
Godsgrace surgery was success and mom is safe here and happy

All thanks to the doctor.😊and i definitely recommend Dr geetha nagarjun. Her guidance and consultation made all our confusion clear and and gave mom lots of confidence to undergo the surger.",2022-05-23 19:11:39,False,True,Akila,,,

My wife had severe vomiting had to visit late in the evening at 9pm. With such care and knowledge that she carries, we were impressed with first consultation the way she explains things. She almost finished all her consultation we were last to see. But she could still spent about 20mins explaining do and dont’s, symptoms which is common during pregnancy, about diet and exercises. My wife pregnancy went so smooth that she didn't even feel pregnant all through nine months; my wife trusted and followed her all through pregnancy, including diet, exercises, yoga, lamaze, resulting a smooth nine months and my wife had a happy normal delivery of baby boy of weight 3.9kgs. Baby was on the bigger side, where doctor took so much of risk to deliver my wife normally. Doctor waited for almost 22hours. I really appreciate for her patience, support which she gave us at the time of labour. My wife recovered so fast after a normal delivery. We were lucky we found her in Motherhood hospitals- Banashankari. Doctor is available 24*7 for our questions and promptly followed up with me on how I was doing all through pregnancy. Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna is the next best thing happened to us after our baby during this pregnancy. I recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna more than 100%.

But as soon as she entered third trimester multiple problems started. First in GCT got to know that my wife is  in higher side of gestational diabetes then got diagnosed with cholestasis in pregnancy and then got to know that umbilical cord is around our baby's neck because of that baby was not moving much. Everyone told that my wife will be having ceaseron delivery there is no chance of normal but in this whole world Geetha Ma'am came as only hope for us. She told us if we are mentally prepared for normal delivery then we can do normal delivery.  She induced my wife at 38 weeks, and as she promised my wife delivered a healthy baby girl on 16th jan via normal delivery weight 3.6kgs. And my wife followed her instructions very strictly and my wife and baby are doing good. If you live in Bangalore and are expecting a baby please close your eyes and associate with Dr Geetha Nagarjuna.

She was very approachable. 
To begin; my wife was getting checked in Cambridge Hospital near to my house. Visiting was twice in a month and scanning almost every visit; since there was no Cashless Insurance here I was looking for alternative. 
Then I was suggested this Dr. Geetha  and  I visited her from the end of 7th month of my wife pregnancy. *** **** *** ******* ************ ********* literally none scanning was done till delivery. 

Delivery day: My wife felt the water bag is breaking at 1:40 AM Monday; immediately I took her to Motherhood, Bsk. reached there at 1:50 AM, I just whats app ed a message to Dr. Geetha; saying she is admitted; that was about 2 AM. At 2:20 AM she replied that she has spoken to duty doctors.  I went back home to pick up essential item as was back in an hour. By the Dr, Geetha was in LDR, she said the delivery might happen any movement ; she also gave me a chance to witness the last few minutes of normal delivery at one corner side.
I was moved and speechless when I saw the infant. This was my first experience though its my 2nd child. When she congratulated me; I could not even say Thankyou.
I had to leave and wait outside the LDR; at bout 5 AM Dr. Geetha came out of LDR and said both are fine. Then I had voice and thanked her.

Post Pregnancy and Hospitalization:
She visited every day evening enquiring health of my wife and giving necessary suggestions. All 3 days till discharge.

The doctors response; care; follow up is all extremely good. I would strongly suggest and recommend. I was suggested by my cousin who underwent delivery couple of years ago; hers too was a normal delivery. This way I visited her.

Hospital : Mohterhood Banagiri, Bengaluru opp; KIMS
To say  I was extremely satisfied with the Nurse and Care takers there.
They were doing their job wholeheartedly without any expectations from us. The care being given by them when every baby cries at night was superb. I felt they are like another mother there.
On discharge day when we offered some tips to the Nurse they refused.

Doctor is true Professional in her approach and have a very calm and intelligent way of handling all the situation and gave the best output.

I and my mom met Dr. (Geetha nagarjuna) she is incredible. Not only has she taken great care towards my mom surgery of uterus removal,  but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!

I would personally like to explain about my mom situation, we got to know 4years back, that mom  had a Fibroids in the uterus, god's grace she dint suffer the stomach ache, but slowly she got all the side effects, seviour pain in knee and toe, trust us we met all the fine doctors in the city, and everyone said to get the fibroid removed through the major surgery, as mom had already crossed 40+ , she kept on postponed to avoid surgery at this age ...

When we finally decided to undergo the surgery, we again got one more reference and went to Dr.geetha nagarjun,
with the first appointment itself, she gave lots of hope and gave us lots of confidence about the surgery, after all the tests done she said she can do it through laproscopy instead of major surgery, wi should really thank her from the bottom of my heart,
The operation which we postponed for 4 years , finally when Dr.Geetha gave us a hope of laproscopy surgery , we dint gave a second thought, and we made the surgery done within a week,
Godsgrace surgery was success and mom is safe here and happy

All thanks to the doctor.😊and i definitely recommend Dr geetha nagarjun. Her guidance and consultation made all our confusion clear and and gave mom lots of confidence to undergo the surger.",2022-05-23 19:11:39,False,True,Akila,,,

My wife had severe vomiting had to visit late in the evening at 9pm. With such care and knowledge that she carries, we were impressed with first consultation the way she explains things. She almost finished all her consultation we were last to see. But she could still spent about 20mins explaining do and dont’s, symptoms which is common during pregnancy, about diet and exercises. My wife pregnancy went so smooth that she didn't even feel pregnant all through nine months; my wife trusted and followed her all through pregnancy, including diet, exercises, yoga, lamaze, resulting a smooth nine months and my wife had a happy normal delivery of baby boy of weight 3.9kgs. Baby was on the bigger side, where doctor took so much of risk to deliver my wife normally. Doctor waited for almost 22hours. I really appreciate for her patience, support which she gave us at the time of labour. My wife recovered so fast after a normal delivery. We were lucky we found her in Motherhood hospitals- Banashankari. Doctor is available 24*7 for our questions and promptly followed up with me on how I was doing all through pregnancy. Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna is the next best thing happened to us after our baby during this pregnancy. I recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna more than 100%.

Any concerns if I have and call to her personal phone she would always answer all my calls, she never takes consultation fees for any phone consultations or any wats app video consultations. She will just refuse to accept the consultation fee. Hardly we find doctors like her these days.  I could enjoy the full term and with her guidance, I Had a NORMAL DELIVERY only because of her support and guidance. We are blessed with a baby boy weighing 3.8kgs and we’ll always be thankful to mam. Though it is a big baby, She encouraged me for a natural delivery. All my family and friends thought I would land up in c- section because of weight of the baby. My family dint want to risk with normal delivery complications and asked doctor for C section. Doctor said she can still try for normal delivery though it is a big baby. She suggested various exercises and remedies to ease my discomfort and I was able to recover soon after delivery. She is one of the most polite and knowledgeable doctor in the city. She knows her patients well and ensures to make the journey easy. She is a delight to meet and consult.

She was very approachable. 
To begin; my wife was getting checked in Cambridge Hospital near to my house. Visiting was twice in a month and scanning almost every visit; since there was no Cashless Insurance here I was looking for alternative. 
Then I was suggested this Dr. Geetha  and  I visited her from the end of 7th month of my wife pregnancy. *** **** *** ******* ************ ********* literally none scanning was done till delivery. 

Delivery day: My wife felt the water bag is breaking at 1:40 AM Monday; immediately I took her to Motherhood, Bsk. reached there at 1:50 AM, I just whats app ed a message to Dr. Geetha; saying she is admitted; that was about 2 AM. At 2:20 AM she replied that she has spoken to duty doctors.  I went back home to pick up essential item as was back in an hour. By the Dr, Geetha was in LDR, she said the delivery might happen any movement ; she also gave me a chance to witness the last few minutes of normal delivery at one corner side.
I was moved and speechless when I saw the infant. This was my first experience though its my 2nd child. When she congratulated me; I could not even say Thankyou.
I had to leave and wait outside the LDR; at bout 5 AM Dr. Geetha came out of LDR and said both are fine. Then I had voice and thanked her.

Post Pregnancy and Hospitalization:
She visited every day evening enquiring health of my wife and giving necessary suggestions. All 3 days till discharge.

The doctors response; care; follow up is all extremely good. I would strongly suggest and recommend. I was suggested by my cousin who underwent delivery couple of years ago; hers too was a normal delivery. This way I visited her.

Hospital : Mohterhood Banagiri, Bengaluru opp; KIMS
To say  I was extremely satisfied with the Nurse and Care takers there.
They were doing their job wholeheartedly without any expectations from us. The care being given by them when every baby cries at night was superb. I felt they are like another mother there.
On discharge day when we offered some tips to the Nurse they refused.
Such is their commitment 

I am happy both with the Doctor and the Hospital",2021-01-06 05:57:13,False,True,Pradeep M R,,,

She accepted me as her patient when I was towards the end of my first trimester, as I had to change my doctor. I was amazed in the first consultation itself by her depth of medical knowledge, quick diagnosis, and the treatment procedure. I had less amniotic fluid and she recognized the problem merely by hearing the noise during scan (no visual, only audio). She assured me of my baby’s well-being, and after a few sessions of taking IV injections and fluid, combined with a daily oral solution, my amniotic fluid levels returned to normal. She even gave some of the solution sachets for free, and discouraged unnecessary consultation so that we do not spend more than what’s necessary (in fact, she was very approachable on Whatsapp). My vomiting, weight, and blood sugar levels – everything improved under her treatment. She also encouraged me to do Yoga and prepare my body and mind for a normal delivery – she never suggests on unnecessary C-section. After a beautiful pregnancy, I gave birth (normal delivery) to a beautiful baby boy. Even after the delivery, she gave me attention and tips for my and baby’s well-being. I simply cannot thank her enough! For anyone in search of the **** doctor under whose care they can enjoy their motherhood – I very strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna.

She asked us to consider getting admitted to the hospital ASAP to get the indued delivery done, as there are other complications and she didn't want to take the risk + the baby's growth was good too. Also, she put faith in us that even with these complications the normal delivery is possible and she would try her best, and then she did it!

I had to visit her last year since I was not able to conceive normally. As soon as she saw me she was very clear that I have cysts and that has to be cured to try to become pregnant. she treated me for the same for 3 months and then asked me to meet her. The scans were performed and ensured that there was nothing and we can try now. She explained the complete process of ovulation stimulation and gave me HCG shots but some how it got failed. I was very worried and troubled her asking what next.. But the quality I loved in her was her patience, since there was Corona pandemic she suggested me to try naturally for next 3 months and then she shall advice for next treatment and she did not hurry. This patience somewhere convinced me and I tried naturally. The very next month wonder worked!! I was pregnant and that feeling. I called her right away and she asked me to meet her on same day. She adviced me and guided me throughout the journey of my pregnancy. The qualities I love in her 1. Patience 2. Smiling 3. Availability any time - she provided her direct contact number and asked to call her any time even if we have any small doubt 4. Last and most importantly her guidance and support to get the normal vaginal delivery
She was so nice while explaining every small concept of pregnancy each month and making us mentally strong that normal delivery is not painful if we are strong! When I visited her for my 7th month scan I was diagnosed with cervical incompetence. She explained me about the scenarios that without cerclage the baby might come out early pre-term and she prepared me in 2 ways. 1. She provided me medications like progesterone harmone so that the baby will not be delivered early 2. She provided medication so that baby's lungs do mature faster so that there shall be no complications if at all if I deliver preterm. She was prepared and made me prepare for either of it. She put me on bed rest for my month 8. Even then at my 34th week my water broke and I gave her call and immediately she asked me to come to hospital. Throughout she did thorough scans and checks to ensure that baby is fine and I am fine and she did normal vaginal delivery. I don't think anyone shall take such risk when something like this happens at Week 34. She was so patient and quick to deliver my baby. I was induced around 11am and by god's grace delivered baby boy at 4 pm. She explained end to end of my pregnancy.
I must mention my many thanks for all the support, risk she took and the care, love she renders and the encourament and explainatons she provides. She values money a lot. She does not unnecessarily ask us to do additional tests until unless they are really required.
I am speechless for the dedication you have for your work and the love you show for your profession! hats off for that.
Thank you Dr. Geetha for all this. May the almighty bless you and your family with lot of happiness and abundance of joy and love.",2021-01-21 19:07:04,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I feel very happy that I got an opportunity to express my gratitude towards Dr Geetha Nagarjuna. After a thorough research and feedback from dr.santhosh kumar(Pediatrician). we selected motherhood Hospital only because of dr.Geetha Nagarjuna who is known for normal deliveries until unless any complications arise during pregnancy. She is very cool and always have a smile on her face which makes us feel good.My  first delivery was C-section in my hometown ( Govt hospital) and I was thinking  and worrying about 2nd delivery also would be C-section. She accepted me as her patient when I was end of my 2nd trimester, as I had to change of my doctor.

Doctor was always Available and would take my call or would immediately reply back if anything was required. My due date was in 25th dec 2020. Dr Geetha said can't wait beyond 39- 40weeks in case of previous c section as I will have rupture uterus if I wait beyond. I have booked for repeat C section on 24th dec. On 21st dec, I started with slight back pain and pain in the lower abdomen. At 2pm went to Dr Geetha and she said I was 1cm dilated. Labour pain has just started. My baby had single loop of cord around the neck at the time of scan.After examination Dr Geetha said she will try normal if I'm progressing. I was surprised when Dr Geetha said that when I was all prepared for repeat c- section. Till 7pm I was only 3 cms dilated. Baby head wasn't coming down. Pain became very bad, I gave up and asked for c section. She gave me courage and extremely supportive, convinced me and my husband saying she will still try. She was there from beginning till the end of delivery continuously monitoring me and my baby. Finally at night 9:41pm baby girl was born with normal ( vacuum) delivery .In my case No doctor wouldn't have thought of giving trial for normal delivery taking so much of risks.

"Doctor friendliness,Wait time,Value for money,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,PCOD,Infertility And Pcod,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I had the best experience one can ever expect during uncertain times during the COVID 19 lockdown n pandemic. Our baby was born in June 2020 in Motherhood hospital- Banashankari and the days leading to the delivery were very stressful and with lot of uncertainty. Dr Geetha Nagarjuna was very humble and caring during such time.



I Had PCOD issues, was under treatment for 3 months. And I conceived with ovulation induction medicines with her proper guidance and close monitoring.

she was very clear on do's and don'ts and explains the reason behind the symptoms during pregnancy. Rarely she prescribes any medicine other than for Calcium and Iron which is essential during pregnancy. Very patient doctor especially when you have lots of doubts. She has a lot of patience and never hurry things up. She knows in and out and much knowledgeable doctor.



I came to know I had low lying placenta at 13 weeks. Dr Geetha suggested me take bed rest, no exercises, no travelling until the placenta moves up.

Unfortunately I had severe bleeding at 25 weeks, me and my family thought I had an abortion. The way she gave me great confidence, comfort at that moment, can never forget in my life.



She can even predict what will be the test report. Her way of treatment, judgement, communication, confidence everything is too good.

Scan shows I had bleeding because of low lying placenta. Gods Grace everything was good in scan expect bleeding. I was admitted for a day and got discharged. 

Doctor always suggested to call her right away even at mid night in case of emergency. She was the first point of contact for any emergency. She always cares for her patients no matter what. Patients safety is her first priority. Finally my placenta moved up at 36 weeks. 



I started doing exercises after 36 weeks with her guidance. 

She just insisted to do Pelvic/Kegel exercises ,Squats, butterfly, duck walking and sweeping/mopping floor in-order to stay active and healthy.

Due to less pain tolerance and my short height with big baby everyone including me had an impression that I cannot withstand normal delivery.



I was induced at 39 weeks because of big baby. I was in labor for 22 hours, requested Dr Geetha Nagarjuna to go for c section because of intense pain. She made me comfortable by giving epidural analgesia. I Had a “ NORMAL Delivery” delivered baby boy weighing 3.74kgs. 

But she put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Her support , guidance and encouragement during labor was impeccable.

She waited till last moment and insisted on normal delivery though we gave up on our hope.

I never knew that someone would fill that confidence in me which I never had, her smile and positivity will boost the confidence in anyone.



Me and my family was really impressed the patience she has at this young age.

We came to know from my friends that Dr Geetha is very famous for normal deliveries and gives the best trial even during COVID times. She achieved the same in my case.

Seems to keep the ethics of Doctor of providing quality service to people than being looking at bussiness perspective.

Myself and my family members are very happy and we pray great success for her.

We were looking for a good gynecologist in Bangalore and while searching for the same we realized that there are a lot of cases where patients are forced to have C section just because doctors don't want to take any chance of normal delivery if not sure. At that time I searched for a doctor that would try to go for normal delivery if there is even a small chance. While searching I found her and a lot of reviews regarding normal delivery and trust me, it is true!
In my case baby's position was not perfect. Although it was cephalic but baby still had to turn thrice for perfect position and other than that she had two loops of cord around her neck. I am sure if it would have been another doctor he or she might have suggested to go for C section.
I had a friend in my yoga classes who delivered a baby girl on the same day as I did and she also had the same case of two loops of umbilical cord around her baby. However, her doctor suggested to go for a C section. Seems like I was lucky to choose the right doctor.
For any emergency or advice, she would always be there. Infact once I had late night emergency and she reached hospital before I could. Sadly, I am transferred to another city, otherwise I want her to be my doctor for 2nd time too.

I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes later in my pregnancy. Dr.Geetha monitored the baby's growth and activities with due diligence given the complications of GDM. I was put on insulin (12U) per day to control the sugar levels. Liquor level was very less by the time I was in 36 weeks. Baby's heart beat and movements were monitored closely. 

When I went into labor, baby had passed motion at 3cms; still Dr. Geetha gave me normal delivery. Delivery process was very quick and was over in about an hour post getting admitted. Dr.Geetha took quick and dynamic decisions and gave me normal delivery. Post delivery, she has been very supportive and provided me with all the guidance required, be it to travel after 15 days of delivery, monitoring my blood sugars post delivery and diet to be followed.

There was a complication in 38th week of my pregnancy and she recommended to induce labor immediately. I was hospitalized at 10 A.M on 18th November and labor was induced by inserting gel.

I would first like to extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for her constant support in helping me have a safe and normal delivery. We have been consulting Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for PCOD, then she conceived naturally with her guidance and timely follicular monitoring. Dr Geetha Mam came as an angel to our life.

From the very first month of my pregnancy. My wife and I always dreamt of delivering our child normally and our dream came true only because of this wonderful doctor who worked miracles for us. 



I had an issue with my water levels from the beginning of my 7th month and was able to go till the end of the month only with Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna continuous monitoring and treatment. She encouraged us to stay positive at every phase and ensured that we smoothly sailed through the last month till delivery. 

My  wife AFI was 8cms she induced her, she was in labor for about 24 hours, baby had passed motion in the womb, We thought she would go with c- section, 

The way she gave us confidence at that point, changed everything.

Taking so much of risk and my wife had a vacuum ( NORMAL) delivery weighing about 3.54kgs. No Doctor would'nt have taken so much of risk. My Baby was all fine, there was no requirement of NICU care.

I am not quite sure if there are many doctors today who would really go the extra mile, while it might just be simple to do a c-section.

She maintained transparency and educated us about every course of treatment. Her patience and dedication towards her patients and profession is commendable. A doctor who is so passionate towards her profession is hard to find and I'm really grateful to our friends who recommended Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna to us.

We are forever indebted to her for her selfless service. Thank you doctor for being a blessing in disguise and an advocate of God in bringing our bundle of joy to this world.",2021-04-05 13:48:46,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

We were expecting our first child after 5 abortions, we went through the anxious moments in the last few weeks before delivery, as any expecting couple would. At such moments, Geetha Madam's words were soothing, her observations were steely and the occasional one liners were just perfect for us - nothing more, nothing less.

I am very fortunate that I got in touch with Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for my pregnancy and delivery. I really thank the person who recommended her to me, and I recommend her to everyone now. 
The moment I met her I knew I wouldn't want to consult anyone else other than her.

You can trust her judgement 100%! I am not a person who is easily impressed with someone but this woman is a wonder! Golden hands is what they call her and rightly so!! 

She is very systematic in her approach and explains everything very clearly. We always came back with a positive feeling after interacting with her. 
Everyday my wife was taking injection Enoxaparin for my recurrent pregnancy loss. This time fortunately I could carry my pregnancy tilll 38 weeks.

We were planning to go for c- section. We dint want to have any complications with this pregnancy. 
She encouraged my wife with exercises and gave me confidence that my can have a normal delivery by doing internal check at 38 weeks.

The day I got admitted, she induced my wife to get pains. She was in labour for 12 hours. she took epidural. She had absolutely no pain after epidural.

Some of the reasons I was this impressed was her quick decision making ability in the labor room and she does it with such ease and confidence, her wonderful team of nurses.

And to round it all up I almost gave up the last minute for a normal delivery but she did not give up and made sure I did it, and all I am is thankful and greatfull to this woman, hats off to you Doctor!! Never thought I will have Normal Delivery after 5 abortions.

To all women out there looking for a doctor who they can trust with their baby and themselves!!
how hard she works day and night.. this is to name a few!!!                        

In this beautiful world, there are many people performing their duty to the best of their ability and who can put a hand on their heart and say, yes Dr Geetha mam did the best.
