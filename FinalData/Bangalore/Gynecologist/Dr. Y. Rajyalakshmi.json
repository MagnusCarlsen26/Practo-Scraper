This time again she rose to occasion & my wife delivered 2nd child also naturally ( a big deal in today's time).\nThank you mam for the 2 flowers I have in my life.",

No matter how long your list is. She carries a big smile in her face everytime i visit.which gave me  a positive vibe always. I remember some consultations i entered with a big tensed head and came out with a big smile on my face. Never waited long to meet her during the consultations.\n\nShe explained me everything in detail regarding delivery and all. She is always focused on normal delivery.my baby's head was not in down position upto 38 weeks.she waited till 39 week by saying it will change. And yes it did. Unfortunately the water level was decreased and i got admitted on the last day of my 39 weeks for the delivery. She tried almost 16 hours for normal delivery.but my body didn't respond well to the induction process and some emergency situation occurred like my baby had done poop inside( i was having continuous cough and nose blockage but no medicines were recommended at that time as it might hurt the delivery process) and i got a C-section.\n\nWill share my experience inside the O.T too. As i was in labour pain I remember before giving anaesthesia to me Rajyalakshmi mam gave me confidence there too to keep calm and everything will be alright.i felt like my mother is beside me.and it made me so happy.after that i was so relaxed and yeah finally saw my baby girl.\nALL thanks to Dr. Rajyalakshmi mam for the proper guidance and treatment during my pregnancy. I am fully satisfied. Thank you mam.\n\nEven she observed me post delivery too. Make me learnt some exercises. And in cloudnine hospital i got all the facilities (bill was high though) and the nurses and the other doctors were so helpful and friendly.\n\nI will highly recommend Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi if you want to consult for your pregnancy or any gynic problem.i am sure you will get your solution with all satisfication.\n\nThank you",

Every visit we went to her she explained us every aspect of the pregnancy period that we were going through, as well as all the tests that we got done and why were those tests being done. I had a very tough pregnancy with acidity, digestive system issues and persistent puking that didn't stop even after first trimester. My hormones were really crazy. She is a very patient doctor and never rushed us just to make time for other patients. Every time I went to her I was impatient and complaining about so many things. She was able to help me with my anxiety and I felt relaxed once I had talked to her. She answered all our questions( be it anything diet, exercise, mood etc.) and in my case exactly told us what and when to be careful when things seemed a little difficult. She was always available on phone and \"availability\" in itself was a big positive for me. The best thing is she never recommended any \"unnecessary\" tests and also recommended us the best place to get the tests done since Cloud Nine Whitefield Hospital at that time around 2 years ago was very new and didn't have all the facilities (now they have). She helped us deliver a beautiful baby who is now an year old. I am so glad I consulted with her for my pregnancy and I would recommend her to anyone who is seeking help for her pregnancy.",

She encourages normal delivery and patiently waits for normal delivery to happen. In our case, she came in the afternoon when we got admitted and waited till evening and never forced for C-section. She patiently supported me during the critical hours and was encouraging me and providing mental support for doing normal delivery. We blessed with the baby by doing normal delivery under the supervision of Rajyalakshmi Doctor.\n\nIn the initial stages, she never prescribed any unwanted medicines or tests. She was always recommending needed medicines and explaining why the tablet needs to be taken. I would strongly recommend her to everyone. I really thank her for being a great support during my wonderful journey.\n",

We are very happy to have found Dr. Rajyalakshmi. She made this journey a very memorable one. Always she has listened to all the symptoms and problems mentioned by my wife. The best part is that she gives importance to important things. Very short and crisp up to the point which is very much helpful. \nEspecially she encourages only normal delivery. The delivery experience was also very good. The doctor came to visit at odd times and comforted us and our family members.\n\nHighly recommend the doctor for pregnancy and delivery for anyone in whitefield area. Cloudnine hospital in whitefield is more like a second home for us and the doctor is like a mentor/guru. \n\nThank you doctor for your patience and support. ",

Even though I was conceived by IVF and she knew that it's complicated pregnancy, but she did normal vaginal delivery for me without any difficulties. I was shocked and ofcourse very happy that we are blessed with a healthy baby boy.

No matter how long your list is. She carries a big smile in her face everytime i visit.which gave me  a positive vibe always. I remember some consultations i entered with a big tensed head and came out with a big smile on my face. Never waited long to meet her during the consultations.\n\nShe explained me everything in detail regarding delivery and all. She is always focused on normal delivery.my baby's head was not in down position upto 38 weeks.she waited till 39 week by saying it will change. And yes it did. Unfortunately the water level was decreased and i got admitted on the last day of my 39 weeks for the delivery. She tried almost 16 hours for normal delivery.but my body didn't respond well to the induction process and some emergency situation occurred like my baby had done poop inside( i was having continuous cough and nose blockage but no medicines were recommended at that time as it might hurt the delivery process) and i got a C-section.\n\nWill share my experience inside the O.T too. As i was in labour pain I remember before giving anaesthesia to me Rajyalakshmi mam gave me confidence there too to keep calm and everything will be alright.i felt like my mother is beside me.and it made me so happy.after that i was so relaxed and yeah finally saw my baby girl.\nALL thanks to Dr. Rajyalakshmi mam for the proper guidance and treatment during my pregnancy. I am fully satisfied. Thank you mam.\n\nEven she observed me post delivery too. Make me learnt some exercises. And in cloudnine hospital i got all the facilities (bill was high though) and the nurses and the other doctors were so helpful and friendly.\n\nI will highly recommend Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi if you want to consult for your pregnancy or any gynic problem.i am sure you will get your solution with all satisfication.\n\nThank you",

Every visit we went to her she explained us every aspect of the pregnancy period that we were going through, as well as all the tests that we got done and why were those tests being done. I had a very tough pregnancy with acidity, digestive system issues and persistent puking that didn't stop even after first trimester. My hormones were really crazy. She is a very patient doctor and never rushed us just to make time for other patients. Every time I went to her I was impatient and complaining about so many things. She was able to help me with my anxiety and I felt relaxed once I had talked to her. She answered all our questions( be it anything diet, exercise, mood etc.) and in my case exactly told us what and when to be careful when things seemed a little difficult. She was always available on phone and \"availability\" in itself was a big positive for me. The best thing is she never recommended any \"unnecessary\" tests and also recommended us the best place to get the tests done since Cloud Nine Whitefield Hospital at that time around 2 years ago was very new and didn't have all the facilities (now they have). She helped us deliver a beautiful baby who is now an year old. I am so glad I consulted with her for my pregnancy and I would recommend her to anyone who is seeking help for her pregnancy.",

She encourages normal delivery and patiently waits for normal delivery to happen. In our case, she came in the afternoon when we got admitted and waited till evening and never forced for C-section. She patiently supported me during the critical hours and was encouraging me and providing mental support for doing normal delivery. We blessed with the baby by doing normal delivery under the supervision of Rajyalakshmi Doctor.\n\nIn the initial stages, she never prescribed any unwanted medicines or tests. She was always recommending needed medicines and explaining why the tablet needs to be taken. I would strongly recommend her to everyone. I really thank her for being a great support during my wonderful journey.\n",

The best part is that she gives importance to important things. Very short and crisp up to the point which is very much helpful. \nEspecially she encourages only normal delivery. The delivery experience was also very good. The doctor came to visit at odd times and comforted us and our family members.\n\nHighly recommend the doctor for pregnancy and delivery for anyone in whitefield area. Cloudnine hospital in whitefield is more like a second home for us and the doctor is like a mentor/guru. \n\nThank you doctor for your patience and support. ",

Even though I was conceived by IVF and she knew that it's complicated pregnancy, but she did normal vaginal delivery for me without any difficulties. I was shocked and ofcourse very happy that we are blessed with a healthy baby boy. She always addressed our concerns politely at any time.Her experience and commendable knowledge  makes us feel that we are in safe hands.I would highly recommend Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi for gynec treatments.",

I was able to give birth to a baby with normal delivery. She was always available for consultation even when she was not on duty. She also reached out to me when I was out of town to make sure I was doing okay. She has been more than a doctor. She has given a very good moral support during the delivery time. I am completely satisfied with her.Really thankful to the Dr.Y.Rajyalakshmi for her great work",

Due to change in my residence during my last days of pregnancy I consulted Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi on 21st(37th +1 week). Doctor clearly explained the complication which my previous doctor also explained. I could not go to my previous hospital as I stayed far away and was convinced to get my delivery done through Dr Y Rajyalakshmi. Doctor tried for normal delivery for nearly 12 hours but my body could not respond as required. So doctor decided for C - Sec which was than the best for baby and me. Even after Post Delivery doctor examined me patiently and explained me how to take care of myself. \nI strongly recommend Dr.Y Rajyalakshmi. \n\nBut I do not recommend Cloudnine whitefield branch as the communication is very poor by the staff there. Till the admission I got nearly 5 different communications regarding the package price. And nursing staff are very rude. One sister literally threw a pillow on my body when I asked her to help me with an extra pillow post delivery. 2nd day I had severe pain and my bladder was full. During this time my mom called sisters for help. But not even a single sister or house keep staff came for help. Billing is hilarious. ****** ** *** **** *** other staff including nurses are not good. \n",

There were some complexities like less ammonotic fluid, low placenta. But she managed everything with her expertise. On the day of delivery, she is reached hospital at 3 AM night. I am blessed with healthy and beautiful baby for which I will be ever thankful to  Dr. Y. Rajyalakshmi.",
