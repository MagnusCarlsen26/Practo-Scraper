Her friendly nature, the way she explains every stage of pregnancy, her patience and her smile, just keeps any pregnant women at ease.. she answered to all my queries patiently at every visit. She made my pregnancy journey as smooth as possible.  Even on the day of my delivery, even though it was in the middle of the night she came to the hospital and made sure she was there until the baby was born and it was a normal delivery. Every stage was explained even in the labour room and I donâ€™t think anyone could have made my delivery feel so easy! Thanks to the doctor, she was really like another mother at the labour room. I highly recommend her to all the preggie mommies!
