It was 6 years of my marriage and I was not able to conceive. Previous doctors diagnosed PCOS problem and mentioned that it would be difficulty in conceiving. We lost interest and had stopped thinking about having a baby.

	After 2 years, one of my aunt suggested Dr Sripradha in Cloudnine. I took an appointment and met her. She seemed to be down to earth, friendly, understanding and took time to diagnose and come to a conclusion for any medication further. I was diagnosed Chocolate cyst and did a laparoscopy.  

She gave all the positive vibes to us and we as a couple had really found it to be developed hope and were sure this time. I conceived in next 2 months!!!

Dr.Sripradha helped me all 9 months to have a pleased and smooth going pregnancy. She carried her patience all over my pregnancy with all my stupid questions and unnecessary scare of anything unpleasant to happen. 

She was so committed and helpful during all the ups and downs in my pregnancy when I had complications in my 5th month.

On 10th July 2015, I delivered a baby boy – Healthy, Tall and Heavy weighted that really changed my world.

Tanya and I had an incredible experience with you during our pregnancy. The normal delivery was a wonderful culmination of your care and support. Your approachability and openness have always been a comfort to us. When we've discussed anything with you, you've explained everything with a warm smile, eliminating our usual fear of doctor visits 😄. Your sharing of personal contact details during our initial visit made us feel supported and cared for throughout. Every consultation left us feeling confident and positive about our journey. Your detailed explanations at every stage of the pregnancy were immensely helpful. Despite your hectic schedule, your lively presence was always reassuring. Thank you for making our pregnancy journey comfortable and creating memories we'll cherish forever.
