It was confirmed that we will be having twin babies and finally blessed with 2 cute boys on March 06, 2017.\n\nCare taken by the doctor during critical situations of pregnancy.\n\n1. During 02nd month she had severe bleeding and admitted to the hospital. The doctor came immediately and checked the babies and my wife and managed so that the bleeding got stopped and all were fine.\n2. During 03rd month had cervical stitches which was early detected by the doctor during regular check ups. The time and the way doctor took the decision is really appreciable because with the twin babies it would have been very difficult and due to this miscarriage was prevented.\n3. Almost at the end of 06th month, had severe early contraction pains at midnight and got admitted to the hospital again. Doctor managed and took utmost care so that the delivery is postponed.\n\nAlong with these critical conditions , she had diabetics & hypertension which was also taken care completely.\n \nFinally my wife completed 8 months (36 weeks) and got delivered twin boys.\n\nAll the family members are really happy and very much convinced with the doctors treatment / care / managing during critical conditions and the way of responding.\n\nFor those who are planning to consult this doctor, we strongly recommend to have the consultations. She will be taking care of the patients with care and patience.\n\nThank you very much Dr Triveni for all your care, support during my wife's pregnancy and giving us the 2 cute little boys :)",

My wife was Having PCOD, it was difficult for us. We got to know about PCOD when we met Dr. Triveni. Initially we were hesitant to start the process explained by her. However, we wanted to be positive and had a long conversation with her about this. \n\nShe ensured everything will be fine. We started the process in the month of Oct and in the month of December my wife conceived. There after we went on regular check ups without any misses and followed all the prescription given by her.  From day 1 she has taken good care of my wife and during every check up she has provided ample information about the baby's growth and condition( All scans including blood,Sugar, Urine and Anomaly). Every single issues related to baby was handled with ease by her. Finally we went to our native after 7 months of check up and during that phase also she gave us information what all are needed and what need to be done in 8th and 9th month. Finally on 30th July we had a baby boy born( Normal Delivery- CMC Vellore). \n\nFinally I want to say about Dr. Triveni is that she is one of the best doctors we have seen in recent times. She carries more than 13 years in this Industry and she is humble all the time you visit. She asks every single questions and remembers each and every conversation with every patient who is visiting her regularly. Though the tablets and few Injection might seems little expensive but for problems we had it was the best. Don't be hesitant in meeting her. She knows what she is prescribing . Have a faith on her.\n\nI will highly recommend her to everyone who is reading this and I have already recommended it to few of my friends.\n\nKeep up the good work Dr. Triveni. Thank you for taking care of my Wife. We really are grateful for everything you have done.\n\nRegards,\nSushmitha & Naveen ",

The day I met Triveni ma'am all my problems started getting resolved gradually and with great care, patience and proper guidance of ma'am, I could conceive and finally delivered a healthy term baby girl on 3rd April. Dr. Triveni is very humble and patient friendly. Before advicing anything she always tries to understand the problem and also the past history of the patient, thus the treatment is always on spot and works very well. I still remember the day morning I took my pregnancy test at home and informed her over WhatsApp and for the same day I also booked appointment to visit her at hospital..And in the hospital when I met her she was so happy for me, i could feel that. Throughout my entire pregnancy journey she was always there to guide me even on call and over WhatsApp incase I couldn't make it to hospital and gave the correct advice at right time which helped me to complete the term without any complications. She has taken all the precautionary measures during my pregnancy which has kept both me and my baby healthy till my delivery. Even after my delivery she is taking care of all the aspects of my postpartum journey so that my mental as well as physical health would be in good shape for forever. Most importantly Dr. Triveni is a great human being. ",

Honestly there was a lot of negative response and no proper guidance from them. We kept searching for doctors and came across Dr Triveni in the beginning of 2021 in Practo. We started visiting her in her clinic first. My first impression, she is very calm, composed and explains to us every thing in detail. Good part was, she always told us that it may take time (as there were few complications) but we will have a baby. This positivity gave us a lot of assurance plus her lovely behaviour.We visited her always advised and the treatment went on. She explain us in every stage about the problem and what the treatment is about out.I was able to conceive in April, 2022. She guided me through my pregnancy like I am her family member. Always available on phone and messages for me. She has answered my calls during her vacation, during function at her home, while she was traveling. She answered calls at every time and guided me with the medicines or alternate steps.We now have a baby and it is all because of Dr Triveni. She came to our life like God and she will be like one forever for us. We almost lost hope of having a baby but she kept our hopes alive and kept us positive throughout. We don't know how to thank her for what she has done for us but we will be forever grateful to her.Thank You,Sananda and Shubhabrata",

I remember how I got worried and reached Dr's clinic. she checked me and adviced me for a complete bed rest followed by the required medicines.Unnecessarily she has never sent me for any tests or scans.even during when lockdown started she was always approachable via phone.she supported me throughout a lot.During my third trimester I got diagnosed with preeclampsia and used to have a very high blood pressure n swelling.Dr adviced me an appropriate strict diet followed by medicines to keep my bp in track. since I was diagnosed with preeclampsia my pregnancy had become a little complicated so chances were there that I had to give birth a little early around 36 weeks.I still remember the day before my child was born, Dr calmed me down and prepared me for the situation ahead n to face it bravely. today my child is three months old.Even today if there is any health issue I take her suggestion. the staff members too at the clinic have been supportive and helpful.Thank you Doctor for your support, treatment, advice , positivity and friendly way in which you have treated meShashank and Shefali \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",

I was suffering from pcos and it was difficult for me to get pregnant, but with her treatment and continuous checkup I got pregnant. I also had a miscarriage when I was 5 months pregnant, the reason was cervical incompetence. I waited few more months to get pregnant again, but this time she suggested cervical stitching to save my pregnancy and I  was put on bed rest. And finally blessed with a baby boy. I want to tell everyone who is looking for a good gynaecologist, please come to her. She is always available whenever u face any problem. And u will definitely end up having a baby for sure. I highly recommend this gynaecologist to every woman out there.",

It was confirmed that we will be having twin babies and finally blessed with 2 cute boys on March 06, 2017.\n\nCare taken by the doctor during critical situations of pregnancy.\n\n1. During 02nd month she had severe bleeding and admitted to the hospital. The doctor came immediately and checked the babies and my wife and managed so that the bleeding got stopped and all were fine.\n2. During 03rd month had cervical stitches which was early detected by the doctor during regular check ups. The time and the way doctor took the decision is really appreciable because with the twin babies it would have been very difficult and due to this miscarriage was prevented.\n3. Almost at the end of 06th month, had severe early contraction pains at midnight and got admitted to the hospital again. Doctor managed and took utmost care so that the delivery is postponed.\n\nAlong with these critical conditions , she had diabetics & hypertension which was also taken care completely.\n \nFinally my wife completed 8 months (36 weeks) and got delivered twin boys.\n\nAll the family members are really happy and very much convinced with the doctors treatment / care / managing during critical conditions and the way of responding.\n\nFor those who are planning to consult this doctor, we strongly recommend to have the consultations. She will be taking care of the patients with care and patience.\n\nThank you very much Dr Triveni for all your care, support during my wife's pregnancy and giving us the 2 cute little boys :)",

My wife was Having PCOD, it was difficult for us. We got to know about PCOD when we met Dr. Triveni. Initially we were hesitant to start the process explained by her. However, we wanted to be positive and had a long conversation with her about this. \n\nShe ensured everything will be fine. We started the process in the month of Oct and in the month of December my wife conceived. There after we went on regular check ups without any misses and followed all the prescription given by her.  From day 1 she has taken good care of my wife and during every check up she has provided ample information about the baby's growth and condition( All scans including blood,Sugar, Urine and Anomaly). Every single issues related to baby was handled with ease by her. Finally we went to our native after 7 months of check up and during that phase also she gave us information what all are needed and what need to be done in 8th and 9th month. Finally on 30th July we had a baby boy born( Normal Delivery- CMC Vellore). \n\nFinally I want to say about Dr. Triveni is that she is one of the best doctors we have seen in recent times. She carries more than 13 years in this Industry and she is humble all the time you visit. She asks every single questions and remembers each and every conversation with every patient who is visiting her regularly. Though the tablets and few Injection might seems little expensive but for problems we had it was the best. Don't be hesitant in meeting her. She knows what she is prescribing . Have a faith on her.\n\nI will highly recommend her to everyone who is reading this and I have already recommended it to few of my friends.\n\nKeep up the good work Dr. Triveni. Thank you for taking care of my Wife. We really are grateful for everything you have done.\n\nRegards,\nSushmitha & Naveen ",

The day I met Triveni ma'am all my problems started getting resolved gradually and with great care, patience and proper guidance of ma'am, I could conceive and finally delivered a healthy term baby girl on 3rd April. Dr. Triveni is very humble and patient friendly. Before advicing anything she always tries to understand the problem and also the past history of the patient, thus the treatment is always on spot and works very well. I still remember the day morning I took my pregnancy test at home and informed her over WhatsApp and for the same day I also booked appointment to visit her at hospital..And in the hospital when I met her she was so happy for me, i could feel that. Throughout my entire pregnancy journey she was always there to guide me even on call and over WhatsApp incase I couldn't make it to hospital and gave the correct advice at right time which helped me to complete the term without any complications. She has taken all the precautionary measures during my pregnancy which has kept both me and my baby healthy till my delivery. Even after my delivery she is taking care of all the aspects of my postpartum journey so that my mental as well as physical health would be in good shape for forever. Most importantly Dr. Triveni is a great human being. ",

Honestly there was a lot of negative response and no proper guidance from them. We kept searching for doctors and came across Dr Triveni in the beginning of 2021 in Practo. We started visiting her in her clinic first. My first impression, she is very calm, composed and explains to us every thing in detail. Good part was, she always told us that it may take time (as there were few complications) but we will have a baby. This positivity gave us a lot of assurance plus her lovely behaviour.We visited her always advised and the treatment went on. She explain us in every stage about the problem and what the treatment is about out.I was able to conceive in April, 2022. She guided me through my pregnancy like I am her family member. Always available on phone and messages for me. She has answered my calls during her vacation, during function at her home, while she was traveling. She answered calls at every time and guided me with the medicines or alternate steps.We now have a baby and it is all because of Dr Triveni. She came to our life like God and she will be like one forever for us. We almost lost hope of having a baby but she kept our hopes alive and kept us positive throughout. We don't know how to thank her for what she has done for us but we will be forever grateful to her.Thank You,Sananda and Shubhabrata",

I remember how I got worried and reached Dr's clinic. she checked me and adviced me for a complete bed rest followed by the required medicines.Unnecessarily she has never sent me for any tests or scans.even during when lockdown started she was always approachable via phone.she supported me throughout a lot.During my third trimester I got diagnosed with preeclampsia and used to have a very high blood pressure n swelling.Dr adviced me an appropriate strict diet followed by medicines to keep my bp in track. since I was diagnosed with preeclampsia my pregnancy had become a little complicated so chances were there that I had to give birth a little early around 36 weeks.I still remember the day before my child was born, Dr calmed me down and prepared me for the situation ahead n to face it bravely. today my child is three months old.Even today if there is any health issue I take her suggestion. the staff members too at the clinic have been supportive and helpful.Thank you Doctor for your support, treatment, advice , positivity and friendly way in which you have treated meShashank and Shefali \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",

I was suffering from pcos and it was difficult for me to get pregnant, but with her treatment and continuous checkup I got pregnant. I also had a miscarriage when I was 5 months pregnant, the reason was cervical incompetence. I waited few more months to get pregnant again, but this time she suggested cervical stitching to save my pregnancy and I  was put on bed rest. And finally blessed with a baby boy. I want to tell everyone who is looking for a good gynaecologist, please come to her. She is always available whenever u face any problem. And u will definitely end up having a baby for sure. I highly recommend this gynaecologist to every woman out there.",

There I got to meet Dr Triveni, a wonderful human being, friendly in nature, very down to earth, she has very good listings skills, she gives ample amount of time for your concerns and then she explains things in layman's language. She will make you understand what's happening in every stage of pregnancy and give enough information and advice and clear all our ambiguities by time.\n\nRight from the beginning, we are in touch base with her and I strongly recommend to others for anything related to gynaecology.\n\nShe prescribes medicine and scanning and other treatments as and when it's needed. Only if it's needed she will recommend to go for the tests/scanning. And even the consultation fee is also reasonable.\n\nAt times, she gives quick response on call or text even she is busy with other consultations. Her response to our urgency is highly appreciable even in her busy schedule. Hats off Dr.\n\nIt's amazing to know, we have this kind of good doctors around. \n\nThank you so much for all the care and support you have been providing us throughout our journey of pregnancy.\n\nRegards,\nNaveen",

But this time we were referred to Dr Triveni and the first time we visited we relised that doctor triveni is sensible and knowledgeable. the way she treated us was impressive and she had some doubt on something but report was normal she took a daring step and informed us to go with small procedure in result that doubt became true and what she did saved our baby's life and unforgettable in result we are blessed with baby boy and the baby is healthy. As I have experience from past Dr Triveni is 100% better and I personally recommend her. ",
