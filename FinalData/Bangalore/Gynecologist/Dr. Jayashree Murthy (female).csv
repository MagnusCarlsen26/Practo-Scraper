"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr.Murthy has been the most friendly dr. I have ever met and it is so important to have a dr. Who can strike a conversation related to your health or anything under the sun. Due to this sometimes the wait can be a little longer. But she was very frank and confident with the treatment. I had a normal delivery the first time and was keen to have a normal one again. She assured me that she will go for normal. Towards the last trimester, I had high BP and complications on the delivery day. Inspite of this, she made  sure that I have a normal delivery. Although to some extent it could have turned out fatal. But she assured me throughout my delivery that nothing would happen and she will ensure everything goes well. Honestly, I felt my baby girl gave her a hard time.... When my baby was born, she told me that it’s underweight but not to worry as she is very healthy and seems to be a smart and strong one. That was so kind of her. She made me very comfortable with those words.
Thank you doctor, for the kind words and assurance. ",2018-03-07 03:20:28,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
