"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Fertilisation In Vitro - Embryo Transfer (IVF - ET),",0,0,YES,"After going through various positive reviews,
and speaking to Mr Sanjay at Mannat Fertility Clinic,
We came down from UK for IVF treatment.
After investigation Dr Archana gave medicines and asked us to come again in Day 11.
With further investigation and additional medicine,embryo transfer was scheduled for day 15.
2 best embroys were transferred.
Took extra care after FET with almost complete bed rest of 15 days.
Finally the result day came and turned out to be negative.
Though ,it was heart breaking but I started doing 1 hr yoga (which actually helped me in recovery) and around 5 kms evening walk.
Dr Archana has suggested yoga and surya namaskar around 6 months back before even coming down to India.
But like most people you tend to follow things pretty seriously only when it really comes down on your head.

After cancelling the 2nd cycle finally the doctor was happy with the blood flow and other parameters required for FET 
the day came when the 2nd cycle FET was to be done. 
But this time the embroys were of not good quality, infact the doctor was totally disheartened with the quality of sample for the embryo and the resultant embroys.
Even then she took the chance of transferring 3 embroys 1 average preserved from 1st cycle and 2 not so good from 2nd cycle.
Though she took the chance but was quite honest about the entire background with me ,the patient which I really aprreciate.
I lost almost all the hopes after hearing all this and started crying like anything in the OT itself. 
With 1-2 hours of continuous crying I gathered myself to go for the 3rd cycle. 
Started checking flight bookings for my husband as he has to come back from UK for providing further sample.
Before leaving the hospital I checked with the doctor how soon she will be able to perform 3rd cycle.
Doctor just said we will do asap but take bed rest only for 2 days and just forget everything.
So after 2 days bed rest i joined office , and since I was not at all hopeful, i did regular household chores , 15 days passed by so quickly.
Finally the result day came and to everyone's suprise it was positive.

Key things which I really liked about Dr Archana and her staff.
a) Doctor is very friendly and give lot of time in interaction with the patient and the family.
  In fact you feel like visiting one of your close friend whom you trust and can share everything.
  This actually eases out the pain and depression one is going through.
  Also increases the trust, if you trust your doctor things definitely works out.
b) She does not give too many medicines. 
c) She analyses each person individually and give treatment accordingly and does not suggest unnecessary treatment just to earn money.
d) She has maintained a very positive environment in her clinic which is reflected in her staff as well.
   Its quite a homely atmosphere and everyone is so jovial and friendly.

In short she is an angel for me and special thanks to her staff (Dr Anjali, Dr Sabhya, RajMani, Rani and everyone else),
Without their team effort I would not have progressed to parenthood.

However, this doctor instantly told us that we should not wait as if the amh goes even lower then no one will be able to do anything. She also said that trying naturally would not be a problem but it would be in our best interest to speed up things a little. She also created a plan for me as in 2 cycles of IUI followed by IVF. Best thing about them is that they do Day 2 or Day 1 scan and in my case they found out a cyst on Day 2 scan which led to cancellation of the entire IUI cycle that month. If I would have listened to other doctor, I would have taken clomid for first few days and then would have come for Day 9 scan and by that time that cyst would have become worse because of Clomid. So, they helped us not only in getting IUI done, the entire process was very systematic, all side effects were taken care of, pre natal vitamins were prescribed well in advance.
