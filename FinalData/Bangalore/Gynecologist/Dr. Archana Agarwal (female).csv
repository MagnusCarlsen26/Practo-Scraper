We heard many positive reviews from our friends and also from online reviews, we thought this would be our last try at the clinic and took an appointment at Dr Archana, 

On our first visit we saw the hospital how clean, hygiene and the hospitality we received from doctors and staff. We usually spend more time waiting at the hospital to talk to doctor, but here it wasn‚Äôt that longer wait.

During our first appointment she was very open to listen to all that we have to say about out past history. she was very clear on her plan to do. Though we had couple unsuccessful IVF cycles but Dr Archana used to take it as a challenge, tested few to exactly know the problem. Whenever we talked to Dr Archana her trust gives us a positive vibes and motivations and then finally we have got that positive Cycle. After hearing this it was not just we who were very happy, but all the staff also which felt like a family members. It was a great experiance

Thanks to all the team of Dr Archana (Dr Meenakshi , all Sisters and Receptionist‚Äôs ) who really took care during this process.
