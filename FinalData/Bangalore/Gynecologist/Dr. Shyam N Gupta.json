I was taking infertility treatment past 16 years from almost all the famous hospitals.  I had undergone 9 failed ivf  in different hospitals and we were planning for surrogacy and met  Dr.shyam Guptha. Doctor suggested us one more IVF and now  I am 6 month pregnant. You are the best doctor which i have seen in my life. He has taken lot of effort and given advanced treatment for me...He is an excellent doctor. I would recommend all those who are facing infertility should get treatment under DR. Shyam Guptha.\n\n",
