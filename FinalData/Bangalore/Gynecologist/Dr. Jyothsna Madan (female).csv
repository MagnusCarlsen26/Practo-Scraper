"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,",,0,0,NO,"The experience was not good..
Don't have words to explain it was that bad...
We had visited since we were planning for pregnancy.. she literally doesn't have time for patients.. I recommend you to choose some other doctor instead of this one who doesn't want to give you time.* *** ***** ** ** *** ******** ** *** **** *** *** ****** *** ** ******** *** ** **** *** **** **** ***** I hadn't organized the file because of my own reasons it doesn't mean she has rights to shout at me.. I was in my own tensions and in that state I was replying her in English though I knew Kannada it doesn't mean she has the rights to shout at me.. when a patient visits a doctor they will have multiple taughts in there mind.. also tensions related to health and surrounding situations.. I really look forward for a doctor who can calm me down and give positive vibes.. a strict no for this doctor.. I personally will never visit her in my life..
