And is the fact that, It's very rare to find a doctor like Dr Ashwini Mam, very special, highly qualified, committed, innovative, expert in all latest medical technologies/procedures, highly experienced, commendable and approachable, explains very clear on the situation and advises only required treatment.
Day 1, we met Dr Ashwini Mam, we found the hope, trust and got a confidence that, we are in right and safe hands.
Dr Ashwini Mam is very kind, transparent, swift,understands the problem very well and directs the concrete, crisp, and right treatment. Also explains the anticipated/probable chances very clearly.
One important point, measures the risk very well and mitigates with all possible precautionary medicines/procedures to reduce the risk at the maximum.
At times, when situation is little critical, Dr Ashwini Mam is more concerned than anyone. Mam is always very supportive, provides instant plenty of solutions/options with medicines/alternative to medicines to avoid any side effects.
What we observed and realized that, always there is a solution for all your problems with Dr Ashwini Mam, and you realize it one by one which we could’t in earlier hospitals.
Wholeheartedly thanks to Dr Ashwini Mam for the life time gifts(We blessed with Angel & Prince).Absolutely no words to express, like us, think how many families got the gifts, really it’s a pride, gratitude, much pleased to be lucky to get the treatment/care under Dr Ashwini Mam.
Take this opportunity to thank Dr Narmatha Mam for all your treatment,scans, support, care, for everything, thank you Mam.
Also, would like to thank all the staff who supported all the way and helped in each phases. Always treated us as Aspire Family members, very polite, supportive, experienced and demonstrating solidarity, smilefull posture is a key motive of Aspire staff and its the indication of right place, Doctors and faculty and feel the confidence of positive hope. Dr. Ashwini Mam has not only given us a ray of hope, but also gave smile on our face to be blessed and cherish for the rest of our life.
We cannot forget how each phases the Dr Ashwini Mam shown us a kindness, care and support is really a pride and blessed. My words will be countless to express my gratitude, thank you for everything and we wish you a very all the best for all future endeavors, wishing to fulfill/achieve all your ambitions, dreams comes true Mam.

And I would also like to mention that I am writing this review with immense pleasure and immense gratefulness to Dr. Ashwini GB.

Usually we have experienced with other doctors that with this kind of high status profession, little ego, little harshness in speaking, business mindedness, busy with crowd of people, treating patients as if they are doing a favor to them, all these come along naturally with people but Doctor Ashwini GB has kept her far far far away from even the shadows of any of these. We have met a few doctors in USA for various other reasons while we were there for quite a while and we found that Doctor Ashwini’s attitude and personal attentiveness matches their level. Unfortunately, we don’t see that kind of humane quality in doctors much in our own country here. Dr. Ashwini is a rare example. Those of you who have experienced usual Doctors’ attitudes in USA during their visits would probably understand my point that I am trying to emphasize here. In our words, we would simply put Dr. Ashwini as “A GREAT HUMAN BEING WHO HAPPENS TO BE A DOCTOR LUCKILY !”
And similarly well trained and wonderful is her entire staff. Her clinic is also very nice, clean with all good facilities including couple of private beds for patients who undergo procedures there. 5 stars for her entire STAFF too !
And we are saying this based on our own first hand experience throughout almost an year right before conception to post delivery. Tried and tested with passing results ! We would strongly recommend if you are planning to have a baby or already on the way to it, Dr. Ashwini is the person to go, you can trust us on this !
A BIG THANK YOU to Dr. Ashwini for bringing the greatest ever joy in our lives with the ease and personal care she did. Only she could do it.  YOU ROCK MA’M !  3 Cheers for you !!!

My wife was undergoing treatment for PCOD in a Multi specialty hospital in Bangalore for almost an year. Her periods got regular with the medications but she was not able to conceive while undergoing treatment there. Then I read the reviews about Aspire clinic in Practo and based on the reviews, we decided to consult Dr.Ashwini. 

Doctor gave ample amount of time for us to hear about past history, present problems and issues we were facing. She was very understanding and have a lot of patience to listen and answer all the questions we were asking her. During the first visit itself , Doctor told my wife will get pregnant and there is no doubt about that. Hearing it was a big relief for us and it gave us lot of confidence. We started the treatment in October last year and finally she got pregnant naturally in March :). My wife is 28 weeks pregnant now and we are eagerly waiting for our baby. As a husband, I can’t express my happiness in words, we find ourselves very lucky that God brought us to Aspire Clinic.

Thanks to Dr Ashwini and her entire team for all the support. Last but not the least, thumbs up to all the support/reception staff for your efficient operational support and management.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Infertlity Treatment - Iui,",0,0,NO,"We had a very bad experience with this doctor.

I had a missed abortion in the first year of our marriage and could not conceive for nearly next 3 years. After consulting many gynaecologists and trying naturally, we lost hope. We felt that we had to take IUI, IVF route. So we found Dr.Ashwini and consulted her. 

She also did not beat around the bush and right away agreed to IUI. But then our bad experiences started happening slowly. The clinic was always over crowded beyond its capacity and we had to spend nearly 3 to 4 hours everytime to get the consultation done. The main doctor (Dr.Ashwini) never does the IUI (atleast for us). Only the second younger doctor always did the IUI for me.  We tried 2 IUIs on Dec 2016 and Jan 2017. Both failed (no result). We were very much heart broken and thought child was never in our destiny. 

We took a break and unexpectedly I became pregnant next month naturally. We became very happy and approached the doctor. ****** ****** *** * **** ***** ***** ********** *** does not show whether she is happy or sad. Anyways, we continued consulting with her for pregnancy. TVS scans in the first 2 months were going fine.

Then the major thing happened. We were advised to do NT/Anomaly scan in their clinic itself during 12th to 14th week. We did it close to end of 14th week and it was 3.3 ( a little higher than the higher normal limit of 2.8). Doctor insisted that we should do another anomaly scan by only a particular radiologist ""Dr.Krishna"". We were already worried by the high value and my husband was not getting enough time off work to take me to Jayanagar. **** *** ****** ******* ** ********** **** *** *********** ** **** So we went ahead and did NT/Anomaly scan in other diagnostic centre.

Meanwhile, we were awaiting the double marker blood test results. Generally, the NT scan values are seen in conjunction with this result. We were so relieved to find that our double marker test results were all positive and were happily waiting to show it to doctor. 

She became extremely angry that day that we did not visit the radiologist she had suggested and virtually threw the other scan report (we got from other diagnostic centre). Despite our multiple requests, she did not even bother to look at the double marker results. And then, she said a sentence which still rings in our ears - 
 "" 'I' do not want to bring a child with down syndrome into this world"" (as if it has already been declared that our child has down syndrome). 

Even with those NT results, the probabilities were around 1:250 or something like that. And she said that we might have to do extra tests (not really asking for our consent or anything) which costs around 50 to 60K and are pretty invasive procedures. 

At this point, we decided to leave this doctor. Nobody other than us (the parents of the child) can decide whether our child should be brought to this earth or not.  I delivered a baby boy on Oct 2017. He is perfectly healthy. 

If someone asks us for recommendation, we would not recommend her.",2017-10-29 11:58:54,False,False,Verified Patient,,,

So obviously before listening our problem she was sure that doctor will say this. We didn't go for scan as we knew that this is not required for what we came. Later our turn came to meet the doctor and we thought that she will tell whatever queries are in our mind. When we asked our questions to the doctor, in every question she was saying you first do the scan later we will  discuss on this.

Normal Scanning charge is 400 and when the patient will conceive they will charge 1400, normal consultation is 300 and when conceived its 600 and in this 600 she will not tell anything.
