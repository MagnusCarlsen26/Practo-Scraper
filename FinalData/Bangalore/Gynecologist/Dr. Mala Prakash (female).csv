I had been seeing her from the start of my pregnancy.  At the last moment I was told that doctor Mala will not deliver my baby. Only her team will be there.

She does not give you her number no matter the emergency. I had fallen right on my stomach and had to go to the hospital, still the doctor did not give her number in case of emergency.

If you start asking a lot of questions especially if you are a first time mother, your questions will not be entertained. 

If you get late to the clinic even by 5-10 minutes, their receptionist will make a hullabaloo and you will be asked to reschedule.

I was forced for an internal checkup. There was no consent. And I was told that how will I manage labour pain if I can’t handle the internal check up. 

The doctor was all pro normal delivery from the start but changed at the last moment.  The doctor pressurised to get an elective c section to be done in week 37 and the reason given to me was that in corona, they don’t want to wait for natural labour pain to start. And in case I opt for normal delivery, and if the pains can start anytime, they will deliver my baby in the covid section of Apollo hospital Bannerghatta even though I would be covid negative. My pregnancy was super smooth. I am not on the heavy side also. All normal. 

I immediately changed my doctor *** *** *** ******** **** **** **** ****** ** ***** ** ***** **** ** **** ******** *** * ****** ****** **** ********** ** **** ** *** ** * ****** ** * ********* ******* *** ****** *** ****** ** ****** ** ****** ** *** **** ****** *** ** *** *** ***** ******** **** * *****
