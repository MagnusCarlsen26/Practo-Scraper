We consulted Dr Mala for treatments of my wife. My wife was suffering from stomach pain. I had a very bad experience of waiting in the clinic.

They have a good staff and clinical environment too. Doctor is experienced enough to listen to the problems and analyse the same and help patients solve them at quickly.

Me and my wife visited Dr Mala Prakash for our personal problems. Doctor is good in treatment and we are happy for the same. Usually there will be a waiting of 30 mins. In our first visit we were waiting for thirty minutes, later in follow up appointments the waiting period increased to one hour and sometimes more than that.

Though the doctor is good the nursing staff whom seems to be old enough is not at all good. She is very careless in performing procedures. We once went to doctor's own clinic (MN Speciality Clinic) to inject drips to my wife as she was suffering from weakness. The nursing staff at the clinic injected so hard that my wife got hurt because of that and the wound went on for many days.

Just because of this we never go to doctor's clinic, instead we go to other places where the same doctor practices. We visit same doctor at different places just because doctor is very good.

Also the consultation fee which doctor charges is very high and it might me difficult for middle class people afford the same.

One of my friend booked appointment for me with Dr. Mala Prakash . I went to Doctor for consultation on my gynecology problems. I had a very bad experience over there. I took appointment for 7.30 PM slot but i was treated by 9.15 PM. When i visited the clinic there were female who were 4 months 6 months and 8 months carrying. A man whose wife was carrying around 8 months was waiting from around 4 PM, he repeatedly asked the doctor to take them on priority, still doctor nor the staff cared about the mother. She never cares her patients.

When it comes to my issue, i had problems with my regular periods, doctor did not even listen to my problem, she randomly prescribed me few medicines, which were too expensive. Her consultation fee (500 INR ) is also too high, added to this no receipt was given for the same. The tablets (which very high dosage tablets) were prescribed for a period of 10 days.

After consuming tablets for 2 days i was feeling very uneasy in my health. Hence i consulted another doctor who suggested me to stop the intake of those tablets as they were not the right tablets that should be prescribed for my problem.

I had checked on internet about my issue, all i got was in such case doctor should perform blood test for thyroid or hemoglobin imbalance or scanning to for other issue, than only they should prescribe the tablets, but nothing like that was done by the doctor.
