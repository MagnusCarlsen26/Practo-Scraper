"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"It was 6 years after marriage and we failed to have a baby. Met several doctors, tried different types of medicines, visited places of worship, my wife went through mental trauma as the people around were always asking about the baby. When everything failed, I came across Dr. Joshita Naik on Google and the reviews were very promising. When we met her the first time, we felt like we are meeting Dhanvantari. She was calm, no hurries, went through everything in the reports and understood our problems and within few months, there was immense happiness at our home and hearts. Next month we are expecting the baby and the only thing we say about Dr. Joshita Naik is THE GODESS in disguise. Thanks so much Doctor ",2021-07-10 03:06:08,False,True,Renu Kumar Nagaraj,,,
