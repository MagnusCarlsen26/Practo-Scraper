None,None,0,0,YES,"She is a wonderful human being and a brilliant doctor to consult who makes sure that you are in the right hands and doesnâ€™t disappoint you. 
I had visited her for a consultation earlier than I had conceived. The way she had diagnosed my problem and treated it with smile I was very satisfied with it and later when I had conceived i visited her for my pregnancy and to describe her brilliance in handling my case itâ€™s just awesome... I am a type of person who gets nervous very easily. And on my each and every visit she had calmed me down and gave me confidence and cleared all my doubts patiently. On the duration of entire 9 months she has kept her treatment smooth and with precaution so that nothing goes wrong. What will you call her when at the time of delivery she had hugged me to calm me down and delivered a beautiful baby girl ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ she is a fantastic doctor and I would Recommend her to all with the rating of 5*.... and to be honest I donâ€™t have enough words to describe her... she is just an amazing human being and an excellent gynaecologist...

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"It was 6 years after marriage and we failed to have a baby. Met several doctors, tried different types of medicines, visited places of worship, my wife went through mental trauma as the people around were always asking about the baby. When everything failed, I came across Dr. Joshita Naik on Google and the reviews were very promising. When we met her the first time, we felt like we are meeting Dhanvantari. She was calm, no hurries, went through everything in the reports and understood our problems and within few months, there was immense happiness at our home and hearts. Next month we are expecting the baby and the only thing we say about Dr. Joshita Naik is THE GODESS in disguise. Thanks so much Doctor ",2021-07-10 03:06:08,False,True,Renu Kumar Nagaraj,,,

None,"Acne,",0,0,NO,"Though Practo shows that Dr. Joshita is available from 6 to 8 p.m, the Hospital only gives appointments until 6:45 p.m. I waited for 35 min the first time. And 30 min the next time (to show the previous reports. She suggested a few more tests which I got done and went back the third time). The third time, my appointment was canceled and shifted to the next day. When I turned up the next day (after a prior call) I had to wait 1 hr 25 min before i was told by the receptionist Sonia - ""you can wait if you want to see the doctor. if not, you may leave"".

Never again visiting Apollo Cradle. By far the worst.

While all this was going on - I enquired if i can get the ultrasound done. they agreed. After waiting for over 45 min for the scan, the doctor simply walked off. 

This hospital does not care about people's time or health! God save those who go here for their pregnancies.",2016-06-04 15:20:53,False,False,Priya M,,,
