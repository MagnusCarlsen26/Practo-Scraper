"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Myomectomy,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Aparna Jha is an absolute expert with loads of empathy, understanding and an endearing attitude. 
In 2022 November , I first consulted Dr. Aparna Jha for a uterine fibroid and pregnancy related concern. She shared her expertise on the fibroid which allayed my fear and guided me on fertility and pregnancy related concerns. Dr. Aparna lend her expertise in every step of my pregnancy journey. She kept a caring eye not only on the fetus but also on the uterine fibroid . Since the uterine fibroid's size increased during the pregnancy , doctor advised that a myomectomy (removal of fibroid) can be done along with c-section which will prevent multiple surgeries. We went ahead with that advise and it was the best decision taken. Just after the c-section delivery , myomectomy was performed to remove the fibroid. I recovered in 2-3 days( in terms of pain and being up and about on my feet). 
I am really thankful and grateful to Dr. Aparna Jha for my smooth pregnancy journey , child delivery and removal of fibroid. I couldn't have received better care from any other doctor.",2024-05-05 06:26:46,False,True,SHAYARI Purkayastha,,,

Under her continuous assistant, I was having a 100% healthy pregnancy and was able to deliver a healthy baby by vaginal birth.

I wanted to have Normal delivery even before planning for my pregnancy. And, it was very difficult to trust anybody for such sensitive journey of our life.
Aparna ma'am always keeps her patients on priority.
Explains everything so well that you would rarely like to have any queries left.
After meeting her, many myths related to pregnancy got broken which I knew.
She is very energetic and keeps her patients at ease even during the tiring labour.
She makes sure that the baby is growing perfectly well in the womb.
Never asks for unnecessary tests and medication.

She is the biggest asset to Apollo Hospital.
Dr. Aparna is the one you can blindly trust to have a beautiful pregnancy and birthing experience.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Myomectomy,Fibroids Removal Surgery,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I have started my first visit with less hopes of completing my maternity and have my own child. It was because I had huge fibroids in my uterus which caused miscarriage once. And I had visited atleast 4-5 doctors who firmly said pregnancy is not possible until fibroids are removed with myomectomy. Even if I undergone surgery they wouldn't promise I can get pregnant again as they saw very less chances.
With all the pain in our life me and my husband decided to try again and leave faith in god. Just after I got positive test results, we have booked our first appointment with Aparna Jha. And first thing she did was making me mentally ready for everything with still asking to keep faith and she would try her best to help us with pregnancy. Here I saw the first difference with other doctors who had concluded my uterus capability on my first visit. Dr.Aparna Jha was supportive, a strong motivator, never gets too much emotional but still understands, prepares the patient physically and mentally. She was available on phone, WhatsApp, online appointment whenever neccessary. Also, on my last day of delivery at midnight 12 where I had water break. I would say she handled all of situations perfectly that I did not even panic with water breaking.

Today, while we are writing this review I have a son of 18 months old who is sleeping in between me and my husband reminding us all of the happy tears when he was born.  We are now living a happy life where we never forget how much Aparna Jha mean go us.
I know is took me so long to write this here, but I say it again she is always comes to our mind.

Fun fact: Me and my husband  call her Appu or Bihar ki Sherni when talk about Dr.Aparna Jha üòâ

Keep us the good work and we meet again when we cross the roads.
