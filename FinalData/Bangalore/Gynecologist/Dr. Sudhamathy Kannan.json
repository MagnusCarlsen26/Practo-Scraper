She always seems to be in a hurry, especially if you book an appointment towards the end of her visiting hours since there are other clinics/hospitals that she is associated with and wants to make money there as well.\r\n3. I have seen her scolding the hospital reception staff in front of us. This does not look professional.\r\n\r\nWe have no personal rivalry against the doctor, but we have just shared what we genuinely felt, not just once, but after observing the doctor for a few visits. We pay so much for hardly 5 minutes of consultation. I feel we deserve to ask relevant questions and get them clarified. \r\n\r\n",

I have seen her scolding the hospital reception staff in front of us. This does not look professional.\r\n\r\nWe have no personal rivalry against the doctor, but we have just shared what we genuinely felt, not just once, but after observing the doctor for a few visits. We pay so much for hardly 5 minutes of consultation. I feel we deserve to ask relevant questions and get them clarified. \r\n\r\n",
