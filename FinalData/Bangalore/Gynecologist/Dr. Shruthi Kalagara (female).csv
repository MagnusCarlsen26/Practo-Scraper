None,None,0,0,YES,"*** ******* ******** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ******** **** *****  She is very friendly. I felt like she was one of my family member. I would highly recommend Dr. Shruthi to all women, and any time she is just a message away or call. She responds to all your doubts everything, let it be small doubts or big, she will reply to all queries.

Mine was first pregnancy and I had induced labour as I didn‚Äôt get any pain after completing 39 weeks too. But I am happy to say I had normal delivery though it was induced. All thanks to Dr Shruthi . I had continuous support from her. She was really great. Once I thought as it is induced pregnancy I might end up getting caesarean, but I appreciate Doctors effort to ensure everything went smooth. Night I admitted to Natus and next day by noon I delivered with proper cervix dilate.  Dr Shruthi has all the patience to wait till the end not like other doctors who goes into a conclude of caesarean.

Thank you once again Dr Shruthi for all your talks and support in my pregnancy journey.‚ô•Ô∏èüòä",2023-08-11 13:34:55,False,True,Snehalatha,,,

If I had delivered my second child safely , it is certainly because of her blessed hands, as I have had a complicated first delivery we were unsure if we should proceed with the second child, however, we consulted with Dr.Shruthi, after thorough examination she had promised me that I will be taken care from day one till we were discharged home safely, and definitely she stood by her words and rendered the best service we could get and she had put her heart and soul to keep us safe.
Thank you Doc.

Then I got a chance to consult with Dr Shruthi. The first meeting itself she made me understood the process and gave me a confident. She was extremely friendly, without whom I would not be able to think of my labour journey. These times normal delivery is very rare. Though I told her to do c-section as I could not bare the contraction pain, but she believed in me and it was a successful normal delivery. Complete credit goes to Dr. Shruthi. 
She was available whenever needed and has never ignored giving guidance post pregnancy. I‚Äôm whole heartedly satisfied. 
Thank you, Dr. Shruthi!!

None,None,0,0,YES,"It was an instant connect when I met Dr.Shruthi on my first visit. It was an unplanned pregnancy and I was so scared and had so many questions and issues in the initial stages but it was never difficult to tackle with her guidance and inputs. She responded to all my questions and WhatsApp messages. She was always a ping away and very responsive. 
My water broke on a Sunday , still she made it to the hospital within no time and made sure the entire process was seem less . She was my confidence. 
The exercises she suggested and the diet helped me maintain a very healthy lifestyle throughout pregnancy and now during postpartum.
I am very glad and feel lucky to have met a person like Dr.Shruthi ‚ù§Ô∏è

None,"Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,NO,"I consulted Dr.Shruti to confirm whether my body is physically ready for pregnancy or not. She recommended many tests, which I took and shared results with her. After sharing the reports, I asked her whether I should visit clinic to understand my reports or she will reply on WhatsApp. She didnt respond anything regarding me coming to clinic to understand my reports, nor she gave a proper response on my reports on WhatsApp. When I asked her whether I'll be fit for pregnancy if I plan it after a year she just responded with ""yes"". My AMH levels were very high than normal. She didn't bother to tell me measures to bring them under control. Neither she helped me to understand what measures I should be taking to regulate my PCOS nor she mentioned my PCOS. When I'm paying so much money to take up the tests recommended by her and her consultation fees, she could atleast share the problem areas she sees in my reports, if not possible on WhatsApp, I asked her whether I should visit clinic for better understanding (for that also she didn't respond). **** *** *********** * ****** ** **** ****** ******",2024-06-07 05:01:27,False,False,Nishant Bavishi,,,
