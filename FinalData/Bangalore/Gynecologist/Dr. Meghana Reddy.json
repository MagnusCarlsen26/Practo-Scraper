At the first time when saw doctor she gave me enough information abt the diet, pregnancy and for normal delivery and she was very friendly to me. On each visit she insisted abt the normal delivery tips. I used to have positive feel each time when I have a conversation with her. She completely remember my health history throughout my preganancy. As she assisted I had done all the exercises and the food control. My due date was Nov 24, 2020. I dilated to 3cm one week before my due date, but due to corona period we need to induce the pain by Nov 20 itself, as I didn't get any pain till that. doctor gave me two dosage of induction on the second dose I got the pain and contraction within 5 hrs I delivered a baby boy on Nov 21st 2020. As it was the lockdown time none of my parents or inlaws with me its only me and my husband and it was our first baby I got the complete support and energy from doctor's words only. Her positive words drove me throughout my pregnancy till my child birth. Whatever problem I report during the visit she gave me a positive word which gave me the strength to deliver the baby without any fear of first pregnancy. My and husband and I believed God has shown her to us while we searching for pregnancy consultation. We wanted to thank doctor for our lifetime. I hope everyone knows abt the importance of normal delivery for a women, I wished to have it but I never believed that I will do a normal delivery  till I meet the doctor because on the present times normal delivery was a bigger thing to be done. Only her encouraging words gave me a belief on myself that I also can make it possible. After delivery also doctor and the hospital gave a complete care to me and the baby. Doctor asked me to visit after 2 weeks of delivery to see the stitches. The stitches are also completely healed without any problem within a month. I am posting it little late my son is now 5 months, we both are doing good. Thank you doctor and God who showed us the doctor",

Dr. Meghana listens to all problems, queries and concerns completely and then explains about the risks and non-risks followed by her remarkable treatment with a beautiful smile. \nIn our case, in the initial months of pregnancy my wife struggled with sever cough. After consulting Dr. Meghana, we saw the results in the 2nd day itself and the medication was zero harm to our baby. Later in the end of 2nd trimester my wife BP was started fluctuating randomly in daily basis and had kept us in scary zone. Right treatment, timely follow-ups and remarkable support through Dr. Meghana\u2019s personal channel made us to reach 38 week 3 days without any issue and we blessed with healthy baby boy.\n\nWe strongly recommend our beloved Dr. Meghana Reddy Jetty, *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** **** *** *** ** **** In one single sentence Dr. Meghana is \u201cone stop solution for pregnancy care\u201d. \nToday me and my family were so much happy because of you.

First we went to gynaeconcologist referred by my physician when my ca 125(marker test or Anti gen test to find if cyst is benign or malignant) level was high and a cyst found near the ovary. Doctor had  recommended us to go for open surgery for the removal of cyst , ovaries and uterus to avoid the risk. Then on my  friend's recommendation, we went to Dr Meghana Reddy for the second opinion, she had a detailed look at the reports,  advised to take ca 125 one more time and ultra sound. With the new ca125 result (it came down) She explained us in detail and helped us to understand the diagnosis and go for Laproscopy. Her knowledge and confidence made our decision easy. She performed laparoscopic surgery and removed the cyst and it turned out as predicted to be benign. She took extremely good care from diagnosis to surgery and post surgery. Her empathy, sound knowledge, calm, composed and caring nature gives required comfort and confidence. I really appreciate Dr Meghana has taken care of the entire situation and the care she is taking after the surgery. Highly recommended for any Gyneac issues.",

At the first time when saw doctor she gave me enough information abt the diet, pregnancy and for normal delivery and she was very friendly to me. On each visit she insisted abt the normal delivery tips. I used to have positive feel each time when I have a conversation with her. She completely remember my health history throughout my preganancy. As she assisted I had done all the exercises and the food control. My due date was Nov 24, 2020. I dilated to 3cm one week before my due date, but due to corona period we need to induce the pain by Nov 20 itself, as I didn't get any pain till that. doctor gave me two dosage of induction on the second dose I got the pain and contraction within 5 hrs I delivered a baby boy on Nov 21st 2020. As it was the lockdown time none of my parents or inlaws with me its only me and my husband and it was our first baby I got the complete support and energy from doctor's words only. Her positive words drove me throughout my pregnancy till my child birth. Whatever problem I report during the visit she gave me a positive word which gave me the strength to deliver the baby without any fear of first pregnancy. My and husband and I believed God has shown her to us while we searching for pregnancy consultation. We wanted to thank doctor for our lifetime. I hope everyone knows abt the importance of normal delivery for a women, I wished to have it but I never believed that I will do a normal delivery  till I meet the doctor because on the present times normal delivery was a bigger thing to be done. Only her encouraging words gave me a belief on myself that I also can make it possible. After delivery also doctor and the hospital gave a complete care to me and the baby. Doctor asked me to visit after 2 weeks of delivery to see the stitches. The stitches are also completely healed without any problem within a month. I am posting it little late my son is now 5 months, we both are doing good. Thank you doctor and God who showed us the doctor",

Dr. Meghana listens to all problems, queries and concerns completely and then explains about the risks and non-risks followed by her remarkable treatment with a beautiful smile. \nIn our case, in the initial months of pregnancy my wife struggled with sever cough. After consulting Dr. Meghana, we saw the results in the 2nd day itself and the medication was zero harm to our baby.

Right treatment, timely follow-ups and remarkable support through Dr. Meghana\u2019s personal channel made us to reach 38 week 3 days without any issue and we blessed with healthy baby boy.\n\nWe strongly recommend our beloved Dr. Meghana Reddy Jetty, *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** **** *** *** ** **** In one single sentence Dr. Meghana is \u201cone stop solution for pregnancy care\u201d. \nToday me and my family were so much happy because of you.

First we went to gynaeconcologist referred by my physician when my ca 125(marker test or Anti gen test to find if cyst is benign or malignant) level was high and a cyst found near the ovary. Doctor had  recommended us to go for open surgery for the removal of cyst , ovaries and uterus to avoid the risk. Then on my  friend's recommendation, we went to Dr Meghana Reddy for the second opinion, she had a detailed look at the reports,  advised to take ca 125 one more time and ultra sound. With the new ca125 result (it came down) She explained us in detail and helped us to understand the diagnosis and go for Laproscopy. Her knowledge and confidence made our decision easy. She performed laparoscopic surgery and removed the cyst and it turned out as predicted to be benign. She took extremely good care from diagnosis to surgery and post surgery. Her empathy, sound knowledge, calm, composed and caring nature gives required comfort and confidence. I really appreciate Dr Meghana has taken care of the entire situation and the care she is taking after the surgery. Highly recommended for any Gyneac issues.",

This is our first child and I am really happy that I chose Dr. Meghana as my wife\u2019s gynaecologist consultant. All do's n don't's .diet n minimal exercises etc. She is very helpful and makes one feel very approachable.\n\nSince the very first day, she guided us in a very friendly manner regarding everything and my wife just became fan of her. She was very comfortable with doctor. She gave us confidence to go forward with a normal delivery, just close your eyes and let her decide what is right for the baby and the mother. Her knowledge about the patient's needs are unmatched. Thank You\n",

She was very patient to hear out all our concerns and spent more than 30 minutes and addressed all our questions. Within 3 months\u2019 time, I was able to conceive naturally where other doctors were suggesting some surgical treatments. Throughout the pregnancy journey, Dr. Meghna has been very approachable and gave all the required information for a healthy pregnancy. She was even responsive on the personal channel for any questions I had during the journey. Even during Covid times she was able to provide online video consultation and was willing to come to her clinic if required even for 1 patient.\n\nShe had remarkable expertise in operating for C-section in Rainbow Marathahali (I opted for C-section over normal delivery) and in Sep 2021 we had our healthy 3.2Kg baby with us :)\n\nI would highly recommend everyone to consult Dr. Meghna for any Gynac / Obstetrician need. She has great expertise in her profession, keeps her patients away from fancy pregnancy-related products available in the market, and advises them to follow as normal and healthy a routine as possible as she always says \"Pregnancy is not a disease\". She is never in a rush to move to other patients and charges a very nominal fee.",

My wife is blessed with a baby girl recently. Dr. Meghana has always guided and provided us with detailed explanation and way forward. There were few complications in the first and last trimester and Dr. was very helpful in explaining the issue and providing the solution. She has been extra cautious and caring through out our pregnancy which we very much aspired and needed.we are very much thankful for the care and attention provided to us by Dr. Meghana. I would seriously recommend consulting Dr. Meghana as she can provide the right treatment with an extra care and attention which is highly required during pregnancy. ",

She paid utmost care in everything and boosted my morale everytime she came for checkup in hospital room after surgery and was extremely vigilant in telling me solutions to all uneasiness I was facing. It was just coz of her motivation , kind words and expertise in treatment that I was able to cope up with surgery and was even able to walk day 2 onwards. I am really thankful to her.",
