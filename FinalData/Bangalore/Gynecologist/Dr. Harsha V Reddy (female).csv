"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"One of the best decision I made was to consult dr. Harsha. I was initially taking treatment from other hospital bcos of some personal reasons switched my doctor. When I met dr. Harsha with my previous reports (6th month of pregnancy) she has gone through all the reports, explained the situation and asked to continue same tablets, encouraged me to have healthy diet and excersise. My second and third trimester journey was really smooth bcos of her advices. 
At the end of third trimester she explained clearly abt all the scenarios of delivery process. When I was in 39th weeks ,she said that baby weight is seems to be higher than normal range if we wait till natural labour pains then baby might gain more weight in that case labour process would be difficult. So she said will induce labour and try for normal delivery if not possible will go for C-section. 
On the of delivery she suggested me to get one more scan. By seeing those reports ( baby's weight and head circumference was large) she suggested and clearly explaind that NVT would be difficult if we proceed with that it may hurt baby, will go for C-section. My family also agreed for C-section bcoz baby was too large and we want our baby to be safe. Then finally we accepted for C-section but we wanted the operation on a particular time. Finalised time slot, on the day of operation she was exactly on time and operation also completed on scheduled time. We were blessed with a cute and healthy baby boy. 
We were very happy and very much satisfied with Dr's service. We always remember her and would defenatly recommend dr. Harsha to my friends and family members.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Dr. Harsha was my consultant gynecologist for my 1st pregnancy from 5th month onwards. My initial  treatment started in home town because we were working from home during COVID. When my husband's office started and we came down to Bangalore, I was really concerned about changing doctor during my 5th month of pregnancy. I did all my research before meeting her and was too much worried about how will she react after knowing that I am changing doctor at this time. But there she was, too much calm and she went through all my previous reports one by one and made a note of all of it. She was very clear in her instructions. Also, the most important thing was she didn't change or added any of my medicines.

I know it's gonna be a long story here but after few more visits, I got infected with COVID. She used to respond to all my emails and gave proper instructions. Also, at around 7th month of my pregnancy, in my scan I was diagnosed with short cervix and I was having gestational diabetes as well. She gave clear instructions on what could happen and asked me to follow strict diet and complete bedrest. Also, I could deliver prematurely, so she gave medicines and injections accordingly so that I can deliver at the right time.

I followed complete bed rest, blood sugar monitoring and strict diet during pregnancy. And with her help, there came when I was into my 37th week and I went to her for 9th month check up. She examined me physically and said that I am already 2cm dilated. She asked me to get admitted on the same day as I was going to deliver today. I was really worried and was literally sweating. But she seemed excited of me delivering at the same day. At around 8 PM in evening, I got admitted to hospital and around 12 AM , I was fully dilated. I was not able to push for around 2 hrs, but there she was giving her clear instructions and she had to wait 2 hrs for me to push. She was still calm in her words and didn't shouted even once. She was always saying that you can do it. With all her help I could deliver normally at around 2 am in the morning. I am really blessed to be consulting with such a good doctor. As a human being also, she is  quite good.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES," I have consulted with Dr. Harsha at CloudNine, Bellandur for ObGyn. Initially when I was looking for gynaecologist in  Bellandur area I came across reviews of Dr. Harsha Reddy on online forums. Reading these reviews I was convinced that she dedicates her time to your case, does thorough check on med history and prepares a personalised consultation routine. I experienced the above when I consulted for early pregnancy in Sept 2019. Dr. Harsha advised me on the nutrition and supplements. Based on ultrasound scan reviews and pregnancy progress she revised the medications, nutrition info, supplements and exercise routines. But she never has advised on medicines or scans unnecessarily...  She has a calming presence which helps soothe anxious moms like me. She will ask if you have doubts or anxiety at every visit. With COVID-19 restrictions coming in early 2020, visits to Clinic had to be reduced. I was glad that the video consultations with Dr. Harsha helped keep the health routines in check. During 3rd trimester, for physical consultations, Dr. Harsha provided overview of future consultations so that all bookings including scans could be advance booked.  Nearing delivery, she would check in on me and be available on call as well as come to the clinic for any unplanned checkup. We had opted for natural delivery and Dr. Harsha was committed to easing the process for us. Since I went into labor before the due date, she examined and  advised to get admitted for delivery and really calmed me down. Dr. Harsha and labour room team were by my side through the labor and delivery. They kept me motivated and focused on the natural delivery and supported me (emotionally, mentally and physically) throughout. I thank her for being by my side through this journey and helping us bring our bundle of joy to the world.",2020-10-03 16:09:47,False,True,Shweta,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES," Dr Harsha V Reddy is a true professional and she spends enough time to understand every minute detail to provide the right treatment, recommendation and minimal medications to her patients. We were planning for kid and had some issues including miscarriage in past, my friends 
 even suggesting for IVF as an option to avoid further delay but with her expert advice, in the same month we got pregnant without any special/expensive treatment and our journey began.During the pregnancy doctor advised right medicines, diet and activities to ensure both remain healthy. She would ask all relevant questions and pay very close attention to each aspect and keep the couple educated and confident. We got her best support through out the pregnancy.When my wife was admitted for delivery, she was not there in the hospital owing to covid situation and I was worried but what I realised soon is she is in constant touch with the patient and the staff (literally 24x7) and though she were to perform the surgery next day, she was there in the hospital same day evening coz she felt something isn’t right and after her inspection, she explained that the baby have passed urine and we shouldn’t wait for normal delivery and got the csection done.Baby and the mother were doing good after the surgery, the stitches were hardly seen, that’s how perfectly the surgery was done. It’s 2 months now, everything is fine and this wouldn’t be so smooth had we consulted any other doctor.
She is an angel for us! And more than me it’s important what my wife feels....I was in complete aww when my wife told that Harsha mam spoke to her as a friend and took care of her as a mother.***** ******* good human being, caring, ********** sincere and serious for each patient!!!

We would like to express our gratitude towards Dr Harsha for guiding us throughout the Journey and achieving the normal delivery despite of the complications. Overall, it was a great experience to go through the paternity under the guidance of Harsha and we would like to recommend Harsha for couples looking for normal and healthy delivery.
Consultation: 
We started consulting Dr Harsha from 1st month of pregnancy. Harsha helped us with the overall consultations, open suggestions on the tests which are mandatory and tests which can be nice to have etc. We expressed our wish to go for normal delivery and she started providing the tips like regular exercises, balanced diet and managing the sleep cycles etc.
After 7th month, she was able to help us with video calls due to covid. During 9th month, we went to hospital only for the mandatory tests/ checkups.

Delivery: 
Mother got the labour pain on the previous night and got hospitalized by 11PM. Doctor Harsha attended us in the hospital and helped with the initial check-ups in the labour room. It was a very long labour of 12+ hours. It was found that the baby's position is complicated and the normal delivery would be difficult. But Dr. Harsha and team was able to help the mother for the normal delivery and the overall experience was really wonderful. Father was also allowed inside the labour room and OT and witnessed the event of joy. 
After the delivery, the mother and baby were shifted to the private rooms and Dr visited regularly to check the health of mother and do the inspection of the episiotomy related recovery.

We are grateful to Dr Harsha for everything. 
Thank you Harsha:)

Without any recommendation we visited her and we were glad with our destiny that we choose her. This was the first time for us so we were really worried and anxious. However we are really happy and satisfied with her care throughout the pregnancy and post pregnancy.
I always wanted to have normal delivery and I had followed all advice doc gave to be active, maintain healthy diet and daily walking routine but when i was in labour I requested doctor to go for C- section due to extreme pain. But she explained and encouraged me that you are doing good and your body is responding well there are full chances of delivering normally. She was rigid and decided to proceed with normal delivery. With all my past consultations with her somehow I knew and had faith and confidence on what she says and I followed exactly the way she said and finally later I was so blessed to have baby boy delivered normally.
 
During pregnancy i had complaint of severe abdomen and back pain for which she conducted tests to find the route cause and recommended us to meet gastroenterologist as there were gallstone found in ultrasound to avoid any future complication due to ignorance and later she provided medication.
She is crystal clear and explains every necessary required information.

Another case i had was post delivery was my stitches got infection and i was in tremendous pain.When we visited her she examined and was so concerned and told me in why i didn't call her and had all these pain. Later she gave ****** medication and those were healed. Her intention and care for her patient shows how sincere she is at her work.
We are very thankful to her and now i feel a personal bond with her due to her now despite of the fact that it is a doctor patient relationship.

Thank you so much Dr. Harsha😊

I felt very positive and optimistic after meeting her, as it was my first pregnancy and I too had a lot of queries, confusion, fear, tension etc like others. As it was very early, she suggested an early pregnancy scan for me after 4 weeks, but she prescribed the needful medications on that itself and instructed to start having them immediately. After 4 weeks, post scan she confirmed my pregnancy and from then on, the journey continues.We have chosen Dr. Harsha randomly, nobody recommend us. But none of the day, we regretted our decision. She is very positive, friendly, explains each tiny thing very keenly and patiently. On every consultation, she carefully goes through the entries of our last consultation from the file, which implies that she is very responsible and don't want to take the risk of missing anything w.r.t her patients health. She is very approachable through emails with quick responses. She never scared me for anything, instead she always motivated me for normal delivery. As my due date was nearing, she explained to me many scenarios in detail for when to go to hospital. For emergency, she has also provided her mobile number for communication.As her name suggests she brought the same happiness and joy in our lives on Nov 15th, 2019. We were blessed with a baby boy. She has instructed about all the necessary medications post discharge and called for a follow up checkup after a week. We are happy to meet Dr. Harsha and would like to recommend her to all.

We had our reservations when we came to her but all those were gone in the first two meetings. Not only she was quick to peruse through our history but was prompt in recommending us must have tests to ensure the baby was fine. I was on some meds due to existing medical conditions and she informed me that I should stop it and she referred us to to right doctors all of whom were best doctors in Bangalore. Without her help i would not have been able to overcome those meds. She has been an immense pillar of support through out my pregnancy. She listens to all your queries patiently and never writes a test if it's not required.Immediate response on phone calls /emails.Speaking to her during my pregnancy was like sharing everything with an elder sister. She composes you always and encourages you no matter what. I was in labour for 6 long hours and it was getting difficult so i requested her to. Please do a c section. Her response still echoes in my head- you have withstood the pain for 6 hours and give me one more hour to monitor things as if i want to do a c section all it needs is a couple of cuts and stitches and i could have done it 2 days back and not asked you to go through this ordeal. She did take 1.5 hours and ensured that i had a normal delivery when i wanted an easy way out. Without her support my pregnancy would have been very tough leave alone the question of delivery. We as a couple can't muster enough words to thank her. She is not only a great and thorough professional who excels at her trade but above all a great human being.

Took personal care of me through out the pregnancy and made sure every single point through out my pregnancy is taken care with utmost care. My pregnancy is categorised as a high risk one as I had this condition in heart which is known as Hypertrophy cardiomyopathy HCM.Dr in our first visit took a complete notes of my medical history and also the way how first pregnancy was handled. Every time we visited the Dr she revised the entire notes and she will be ready with the next set of plan for us. As it is a high risk pregnancy the Dr was available over phone 24*7 and whenever I called her she listened to the symptoms and guided appropriately. She did a lot of research on my heart condition and was very confident that she is going to do a normal delivery with less labor time and without epidural as it is not advised for people with HCM. There was a big effort that went into getting us the right facilities. The  way she conducted my delivery was awesome as there was one another lady went in to labor in the same time.  The Dr toggled between two different locations and made sure both the deliveries were successful and normal. Post delivery care and follow up was very satisfactory and I would highly recommend the Dr for pregnancy and any gyneac related issues and I am sure you will love the Dr. A few things cannot be expressed by words but suffice to say that we treasure this association with the Doctor. ,2018-12-29 08:47:10,False,True,padmini,,,

We believe Dr. Harsha had gone that extra mile to make our life happy for which we were blessed with a wonderful girl baby. Not a single day passes without we remembering Dr. Harsha whenever we see our smiling angel.

We were always late to visit Dr. Harsha for our consultation given the notorious Bangalore Traffic. But Dr. Harsha never showed her complaint even in her gesture. Dr. Harsha please accept our sincere apologies now :)

On the day of delivery during those anxious moments Dr. Harsha was very patient to answer all our concerns. We remember she had come to the hospital very early to ensure we felt assured that we had no reasons to be worried about the operation. Even during the operation our patience was  tested cause i encountered severe blood loss and ended up with a complicated C-Section.God's blessing in the form of Dr Harsha finally resulted in successful surgery  and our difficult times came to and end and happy times begun with little princess in our hand.

I started consulting her when I was second month pregnant. Starting right from the first day we visited her she listens all the family medical history and everything which is related to your pregnancy or your health.She starts her guidance step by step and always keep in mind the health of the mother and the child. During my pregnancy I had lot of health concerns but she was the one who was very confident enough and always provided me with the correct health solution as well as emotional mental support which is very less seen in doctors now a days.. She always responded to my emails and phone calls. And when my due date was near, to my surprise she herself used to call me up and used to take update each day and guide me over the phone which used to give me more strength and confidence. I still remember the day when I was in labour and she was over the phone the entire night guiding the duty doctor what step needs to be taken. That day an emergencey case also came and the lady who came was also Dr. Harsha patient. As soon as the doctor heard about this emergency case she rushed to the hospital at around 3 at night and served her responsibilities towards the other lady who came. Now a days where doctors are more concerned about Money, I can assure and guarantee that Dr harsha is a doctor who knows her ethics towards her profession and serves the patient keeping in mind their well being. The reason why I am saying this because I was unable to progress in my labour even after 12 hours and hence c section was needed to be done. But Dr. Harsha was the person who said no she would be doing normal delivery and for that we need to wait for more 3 to 4 hours. But my destiny was something else. I had to go c section. I was being taken to the OT and anesthesia was already given still the doctor asked me that she wants to wait for more 3 to 4 hours and that she could take me back to the labour room and wait. Infact she went out and approached my husband and said the same thing to him that she is confident that normal delivery is possible. But as I said destiny have something else written and I have to go c section. Her duties towards her patinet doesn't end here she will also take care her patients after the post delivery and guide the mother each and every thing giving her motivation, positivity and strength to recover fast. Words are less to express what a wonderful doctor she is. I was very lucky and blessed to have a doctor like her beside me everytime and will be thankful to her till my last breath.

And although we did end up with a normal delivery without any complications thanks to her expertise, one thing we particularly appreciate is the way she prepared us for the delivery. She told us very clearly about the situations where delivery will be normal and how to prepare ourselves for it or the situations where it will end up in a c-section for reasons which can't be controlled.

In such scenarios I have heard that many doctors directly go for C section. However Dr. Harsha has tried as much as possible to make the delivery happen normally and avoid C section. However our baby had to be delivered through C section only due to very slow progress in delivery and the risk associated in delaying it further.

We had a discussion with her over trying to have a normal delivery and she was very supportive. Also, she made us aware of the all the scenarios. 

Our due date was when there was a alarming  flood situation in Bangalore and in that situation also we had discussed alternatives with her where she guided us well. When we got admitted to the hospital at night for the delivery she kept a close check on my health condition in every hour or two and guided us to take correct decisions during the process.

After a long labor period , thankfully we were blessed with a healthy baby and the delivery was normal under her guidance.

During my first trimister i had Hyperemesis gravadrium (HG). Because of the execssive nausea and vomiting related to HG i was not able to eat anything and lose more than 5% of my body weight. I requested the doctor to give me IV fluids but she ignored my request saying that vomiting are common and it will go away second trimister onwards and will not cause any threat to my pregnancy. My HG lasted till 16 weeks of pregnancy and during that time i lost 3.5kg weight.  17 weeks onwards i started eating a lot thinking that i will not only have to gain more weight for my pregnancy but will also have to get back my lost weight. I was following the standard weight gain recommendation of 1pound each week by international standard. But this doctor discouraged my weight gain and told me if i start getting so much weight then what will happen at 3rd trimister. Because of this at 28 weeks i was only 55kg. Based on my bmi (body mass index) should have been atleast 58.5 kg as per the international standard.
As such i broke my water at 32 weeks and my baby was born at 34 weeks 5 days through emergency c-section because of placenta abruption. I was a healthy woman with bmi<24 before pregnancy.

here in Bangalore with Dr. Harsha's supervision in cloudnine Bellandur.

Finally, the day came. We were aware that for us it won't be a normal delivery from the 1st day. Just prayed God to help us & on the other hand we have Dr Harsha with us. Dr. Harsh was available during the delivery along with her Team. Delivery got over successfully. Both Mother & baby are well.

That's not the end. We have to be admitted in hospital for around 5 days. So, the thing we appreciate with Dr. Harsha is she took care of my wife's health post operation also in a timely fashion.

Our experience with Dr Harsha was wonderful. Got absolutely what we needed - someone who:
1. Listens patiently to curious first time parents, and answer all questions to their satisfaction
2. Relies least on medication
3. Encourages physical activity based on pregnancy stage. Does not restrict things unnecessarily. Provide essential guidelines for traveling
4. Is available through some medium, and is responsive
5. Supports the couple through the ups and downs of pregnancy from the fear of the first trimester, till the anxiety of delivery.

There were multiple instances in the 9 months when the doctor was more of a friend, and we could rely on her without doubt.
