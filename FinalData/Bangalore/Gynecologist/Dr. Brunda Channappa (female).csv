"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I was recommended Dr Brunda by my relative. When I checked reviews about her on Practo I was a little reluctant as many said she’s strict and straightforward but anyway I went ahead and let me tell that you that’s the best thing that I did.  I was 47 kilos when I was 6 weeks pregnant I was very worried about it but when I met her she said I’m healthy and she got all the necessary tests done to make sure everything is fine.. the reports said I had very low iron levels and Vit D. So she immediately gave me the necessary tablets and she made sure she cross checked everything just to be on the safer side which I really appreciate... not every doctor would take that extra step.  Usually we see pregnancy as a sickness but this doctor made my pregnancy like a cakewalk. She didn’t warn me about anything she said all you have to do is eat healthy and be normal like how I was before pregnancy..in my third trimester I opted for elective c-section ( it was my decision) she suggested we could go for induced labour but I obliged. She neatly explained the pros and cons of a surgery. Then in my 39th I delivered a baby girl. Doc was on time and she did the surgery with so much ease.. I wasn’t on general anaesthesia so I had an idea of what was happening around me. She kept talking to me throughout the surgery and I felt so relieved. I trusted her completely. Then came post partum she made sure she changed my supplements and she even suggested on what I should eat and she kept a tab on my iron levels by getting my blood tested. So be it pre or during or post pregnancy she was there throughout my journey with the same enthusiasm. I would definitely recommend her because she’s such a professional. 
She also has her own clinic. First health clinic which is close by to Cloudnine Jayanagar. Sometimes when I had to just show her my report I’d go to her clinic because it wasn’t as crowded as Cloudnine. 
I’d give her a 10 on 10 for her professionalism and the way she deals with situations. She’s one amazing doctor and a person.",2020-07-24 07:25:59,False,True,Pravin kumar,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Brunda madam was firstly very friendly person or can say someone who’s very known to us  who tries to make us understand whats the issue happening with our body what is the alternatives methods can be done also she suggested me what kind of treatment goes well with my condition 
Also out of the treatment she suggested me other health tips for my further healthier pregnancy. 
Seeing positive negative comments about her i felt little scared that she is straight forward in talk and also half minded before meeting her but then when i met her and spoke to her about my issue happening she calmly listened to me and told me wait for sometime and do scanning again. She gave me a positive hope which other 3 doctors dint gave me a hope wherein i met for the same issue. 
I would highly recommend brunda madam ",2022-04-13 18:08:04,False,True,Keerthi kiran,,,
