None,"Pre and Post Delivery Care,Gynae Problems,",0,0,YES,"We consulted Dr. Brunda Chanappa at Cloud Nine right from the beginning. She also consults at her clinic by name First Health in 3rd Block Jayanagar. I am writing this review about 10 days post the birth of my son whom Dr. Brunda delivered by means of a caesarian as there was a fetal distress in the 33rd week. 

We are very impressed with Dr. Brunda’s proficiency, experience and know-how related to complicated pregnancies and would definitely recommend her as a go-to gynecologist. Her recommendation of a specific blood test in the early stage of pregnancy made sure we got the right medication at the right time due to the presence of a deficiency.

The pregnancy itself was a bumpy ride with my wife being diagnosed with appendicitis in the 12th week. Dr.Brunda worked together with another surgeon at Cloud Nine and ensured the appendicitis surgery went fine by recommending specific doses of medicines to ensure fetus can withstand the surgery. 

Post this, we found that one of the uterine arteries was supplying less blood – once again she prescribed medications to ensure we overcome these complications. Despite all complications she always encouraged by wife to keep doing her regular activities and advised us to not treat pregnancy as a handicap but as a normal phase of life. She even encouraged my wife to continue to work during pregnancy. 

Finally during the 33rd week, one of the scans went awry and when we met Dr. Brunda she immediately asked us to get admitted and performed Non Stress Test (NST) periodically to ensure the safety of the baby. A key thing to highlight is that during the same time, Dr.Brunda was going thru a personal emergency (her husband was hospitalized and in ICU). Despite this, she was a thorough professional and monitored the progress of our baby. Hats off to Dr. Brunda for her dedication to work despite the personal situation she was in. Finally after multiple consultations with another Radiologist who had performed the Pregnancy scans – Dr. Brunda decided to proceed with a Caesarian and successfully delivered the baby. 

However, keep in mind that she is an extremely busy lady and you possibly would be only visiting her once in 3-4 weeks during the course of the pregnancy. You will need to remind her of your specific case each time. We overcame this by making notes and ensuring we go prepared to the consultation session with the questions that we needed to get clarified. Also, note that she is sometimes very open and straight forward if she identifies any issues which may sound a bit negative or discouraging to expectant mothers. But I guess that’s her style of ensuring she does not set too much expectation.

Mine was a first time pregnancy, coupled with the fact that I was a bit on the wrong side of 30 made me very anxious about the whole thing, initially I was consulting another hospital which was near to my home, but felt that the facilities were lacking, so was searching for an alternative.

A friend whose baby was delivered at cloud nine, suggested to consult Dr Brunda Chanappa, and I am so thankful for that.

Dr Brunda delivered my baby girl this December, when I first met the doctor, I was scared, as I had read reviews about her being strict and all, but everything changed after the first consultation, as we quickly understood that she is frank, not the one will sugar coat things.

I have seen her get angry at a lady, as she withheld the information that her “fasting” blood was not really fasting blood, as she had a cup of milk!!, now the lady most likely is going to feel bad about scolding, and you can guess what kind of review will end up coming from her.

This is exactly the point that I want to make here about Dr Brunda.
She has more than 3 decades of world class experience, communicates very clearly on what one need to do and not do, some folks may find her a bit of a disciplinarian, which trust me is exactly what you need. She ensured that I don’t gain weight during pregnancy, never prescribed unnecessary scans or medicines.

She has never rushed me, have always answered my questions, as she is a very strong confident person, people tend to be not themselves in front of her, so end up with a feeling that she does not answer your questions, we noted our questions and only left the room when all of them were answered. NEVER once were we felt we were being rushed.

She is a no nonsense doctor, laying out the facts before you, does not mince words, or try to sugar coat them, she just wants the best for the mom and the baby, and will definitely throw a fit if you gain weight beyond the limit.

For me the pain was induced at night, and the baby was delivered the next morning, all through the night the duty doctors were calling and informing her of my progress, In the morning I was taken to the labour room, the duty doctors prepared everything and then she rushes in, the moment I saw her enter the labour room, I was so so relaxed, cannot explain that feeling, I knew I was safe now.

She calmed me down, as the pain was severe, I did not opt for an epidural, neither did she ever recommend that, then very calmly she led me through the delivery process.

All through out the pregnancy, there was never an instance where she was rude or impatient with me, she was under going severe stress at a personal level, as her husband was in the ICU, but never once did it show.

I have seen her very very stressed out too, a lady was about to lose her twins, as there was a lot of bleeding, she got the lady admitted, directed the doctors on the treatment, then saw me in the consultation room, but her mind was not there, even her handwriting was not the same, we asked her to go and check up on the lady, we will wait, She went and came back a lot calmer afterwards, this showed that her empathy is not at all fake.

There was another instance, where she sent a lady who was in the theatre, fully prepared to give delivery, to be told by her to go home, as it was still not the time, she always tries for a normal delivery, unless the situation warrants a c section.

I am glad that I consulted Dr Brunda, and will always recommend her to anyone who is looking for a good gynaecologist.",2017-02-14 06:11:17,False,True,Sreekala,,,
None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"I want to give a review on Cloudnine and Dr. Brunda Channappa. 
I was completely normal throughout my pregnancy, active and regular excercise. Dr. Brunda never gave sufficient time during my visits and did not explain the delivery process and options such as epidural, etc. She would always be in a hurry.

I did not get labor pain even at 40 weeks. She asked me to get admitted for inducing pain. They admitted me to a common room with 3 beds and did not give me a separate room or take me to the labor room due since all the rooms were full. That room had no facilities at all except for one small bed. No space for my husband also.(he had to sit with me on the same bed).

A general consulting doctor came in and did my internal examination and said that I was already dialating and pain would start shortly. They put me on drips. After an hour she came in again and did my examination. It was about 11pm in the night. I had my next examination at 12:00am. Post that no one came in to check on me for 5 hours.

When my husband went to check with the nurse she repeatedly said the doctor was performing an operation and is busy. By 6pm my pain was unbearable and I could take it no more. I repeatedly called Brunda and my husband was pleading with the nurse to send the doctor to check me.

At 6:30am finally Brunda came and also the consultant doctor came in (I was still in the common room with 3 beds and was never taken to the labor room). Brunda then said the baby's heart beat is dropping and they need to do an emergency c-section. My husband and I had to sign a few documents and my c-section was performed. 

I would never recommend cloudnine or Dr. Brunda to anyone. They only look for extracting money. After delivery i was again shifted to the common room and I had to stay there till evening and then they finally shifted me to a private room.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"This is my first pregnancy. After lot of speculation we thought we should go to cloudnine since we didn't know any other place and we chose Dr. Brunda. Although I have read mixed reviews on practo I thought I should not judge her based on a few bad reviews. So we went ahead since cloud nine assured us that she is a very experienced doctor. 
So Dr. Brunda turns out to be an extremely blunt doctor with no empathy. On the first visit she made herself very clear that she would not entertain any sob story. Ok, I thought may be that's good...in a way I will be strong. So as my pregnancy proceeded I developed cramps in my stomach...like serious cramps. When I told doctor about those cramps and asked her why it might be happening...her epic reply was, '' pregnant women come with various imaginary complaints, we can't explain everything. If it was so serious today you wouldn't be able to sit in front of me''. However I was not convinced. So I decided to take another opinion. These cramps were really bothering me. So my new doctor examines me, even without me telling her she asked me if i  have cramps. When I said yes, she examined me some more and said that my uterus is soft and I have chances of going into premature Labour!!!! She put me on medication immediately. I was shocked. Dr. Brunda didn't even listen to my complaint...didn't examine me...directly concluded that my problem was imaginary. Other than this particular experience there were instances where she would not listen to complaints I had regarding my health. ''Don't cry wolf. Because when the wolf would actually be here I wouldn't know''. So I actually stopped complaining and started googling for anything that bothered me.
After this I am definetely never going back to her neither am I recommending anyone to go to her.
A piece of advice for the doctor. Not everyone knows what to expect during pregnancy. As a doctor we look up to you. We trust you. The least a patient can expect is your empathy and a listening ear.",2017-12-25 04:42:06,False,False,Tantrima Basistha,,,

When I checked reviews about her on Practo I was a little reluctant as many said she’s strict and straightforward but anyway I went ahead and let me tell that you that’s the best thing that I did.  I was 47 kilos when I was 6 weeks pregnant I was very worried about it but when I met her she said I’m healthy and she got all the necessary tests done to make sure everything is fine.. the reports said I had very low iron levels and Vit D. So she immediately gave me the necessary tablets and she made sure she cross checked everything just to be on the safer side which I really appreciate... not every doctor would take that extra step.  Usually we see pregnancy as a sickness but this doctor made my pregnancy like a cakewalk. She didn’t warn me about anything she said all you have to do is eat healthy and be normal like how I was before pregnancy..in my third trimester I opted for elective c-section ( it was my decision) she suggested we could go for induced labour but I obliged. She neatly explained the pros and cons of a surgery. Then in my 39th I delivered a baby girl. Doc was on time and she did the surgery with so much ease.. I wasn’t on general anaesthesia so I had an idea of what was happening around me. She kept talking to me throughout the surgery and I felt so relieved. I trusted her completely. Then came post partum she made sure she changed my supplements and she even suggested on what I should eat and she kept a tab on my iron levels by getting my blood tested. So be it pre or during or post pregnancy she was there throughout my journey with the same enthusiasm. I would definitely recommend her because she’s such a professional. 
She also has her own clinic. First health clinic which is close by to Cloudnine Jayanagar. Sometimes when I had to just show her my report I’d go to her clinic because it wasn’t as crowded as Cloudnine.
