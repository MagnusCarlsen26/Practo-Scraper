We just had that mutual trust between us and we believed the doctor 100%.\n\nBefore the due date she explained us the scenarios where she could try for c section delivery. Even during that time we didn't ask for assurance of normal delivery. When the time came, everything happened as planned by doctor and my wife had a normal delivery. By this everyone can understand that this doctor is 100% trust worthy.\n\nEven during midnight doctor was answering the calls of sisters to know the status of my wife's condition. She arrived early in the morning once the water broke and delivered the kid. It was such a pleasant experience.\n\nShe even took time to check on the patient after delivery and even spoke to the elders of the family to make sure she gets nutritious food and not to restrict to any diet that involves not giving much water etc. and after following the diet that doctor recommended, baby's weight is also increased healthily\n\nShe is 100% genuine and we love her",

However, my worries were quickly put to rest after my initial appointment with her. From that point on, I regularly sought her guidance throughout my pregnancy journey.Dr. Pavana Prakash is not only a skilled and knowledgeable doctor, but she also possesses a warm and approachable demeanor. I felt comfortable discussing even the most trivial gynecological concerns with her without any hesitation. Her friendly nature made a significant difference in my experience.Thanks to her expertise and support, my pregnancy journey was largely smooth. Dr. Pavana Prakash played a crucial role in ensuring everything went well. Additionally, her availability on WhatsApp and for calls 24/7 was immensely helpful and convenient. I had a fantastic experience with her during my first pregnancy.Without a doubt, I highly recommend Dr. Pavana Prakash to anyone in search of a competent and affable doctor. She genuinely cares for her patients and provides exceptional care.",

I had to undergo c section as I stopped feeling baby movements . I was quite well but after a week I had secondary PPH and that was the toughest situation . I was bleeding heavily . Got admitted again and mam picked up the call at 12 in the night and she came to meet me at 2 Am in the night in the hospital. She was available at that odd hours. She stopped my bleeding the same night. She was with me till 7 30 in the morning. D and C was done and I recovered .I would reco her for 3 reasons - friendly , availability, handles high risk during pregnancy \n very well. ",

She makes you feel comfortable, explains every doubt of yours with at most patience and gives you the right advice to help you with your anxiety(because pregnancy is one of the most anxious times in a woman\u2019s life, let\u2019s be honest). My pregnancy was especially a difficult one because , I had a huge intramural fibroid. The doctor I was consulting before her, told me point blank that I might only be able to carry the baby till 34 weeks max and to be prepared for any casualties. She was rude and behaved like I was wasting her time which made me feel anxious and hope less. That\u2019s when I did my research and decided to consult Pavanna Prakash and thank God I did. She put me at ease from our very first meeting, made me feel hopeful, took quick decisions when she saw any issues with my ultrasound and with her help, I was able to deliver my baby at 38th week. I\u2019m ever so thankful to her. Thank you!",

We just had that mutual trust between us and we believed the doctor 100%.\n\nBefore the due date she explained us the scenarios where she could try for c section delivery. Even during that time we didn't ask for assurance of normal delivery. When the time came, everything happened as planned by doctor and my wife had a normal delivery. By this everyone can understand that this doctor is 100% trust worthy.\n\nEven during midnight doctor was answering the calls of sisters to know the status of my wife's condition. She arrived early in the morning once the water broke and delivered the kid. It was such a pleasant experience.\n\nShe even took time to check on the patient after delivery and even spoke to the elders of the family to make sure she gets nutritious food and not to restrict to any diet that involves not giving much water etc. and after following the diet that doctor recommended, baby's weight is also increased healthily\n\nShe is 100% genuine and we love her",

However, my worries were quickly put to rest after my initial appointment with her. From that point on, I regularly sought her guidance throughout my pregnancy journey.Dr. Pavana Prakash is not only a skilled and knowledgeable doctor, but she also possesses a warm and approachable demeanor. I felt comfortable discussing even the most trivial gynecological concerns with her without any hesitation. Her friendly nature made a significant difference in my experience.Thanks to her expertise and support, my pregnancy journey was largely smooth. Dr. Pavana Prakash played a crucial role in ensuring everything went well. Additionally, her availability on WhatsApp and for calls 24/7 was immensely helpful and convenient. I had a fantastic experience with her during my first pregnancy.Without a doubt, I highly recommend Dr. Pavana Prakash to anyone in search of a competent and affable doctor. She genuinely cares for her patients and provides exceptional care.",

My first delivery was quite complicated and I was afraid during this pregnancy.Pavana mam was very friendly. Unfortunately I had an emergency and my consulting doctor had recommended  to get admitted as the aminiotic fluid was less around the baby.\nI explained pavana mam about  this and she immediately  took control of situation.  I had to undergo c section as I stopped feeling baby movements . I was quite well but after a week I had secondary PPH and that was the toughest situation . I was bleeding heavily . Got admitted again and mam picked up the call at 12 in the night and she came to meet me at 2 Am in the night in the hospital. She was available at that odd hours. She stopped my bleeding the same night. She was with me till 7 30 in the morning. D and C was done and I recovered .I would reco her for 3 reasons - friendly , availability, handles high risk during pregnancy \n very well. ",

She makes you feel comfortable, explains every doubt of yours with at most patience and gives you the right advice to help you with your anxiety(because pregnancy is one of the most anxious times in a woman\u2019s life, let\u2019s be honest). My pregnancy was especially a difficult one because , I had a huge intramural fibroid. The doctor I was consulting before her, told me point blank that I might only be able to carry the baby till 34 weeks max and to be prepared for any casualties. She was rude and behaved like I was wasting her time which made me feel anxious and hope less. That\u2019s when I did my research and decided to consult Pavanna Prakash and thank God I did. She put me at ease from our very first meeting, made me feel hopeful, took quick decisions when she saw any issues with my ultrasound and with her help, I was able to deliver my baby at 38th week. I\u2019m ever so thankful to her. Thank you!",

Pavan Ma\u2019am is nothing less than that \ud83d\ude0a she has all the patience in the world- you may ask her a 100 questions, she would patiently answer and ask if we had any more clarifications. My first pregnancy was smooth due to her handholding at every stage. And it\u2019s not over, her decision to make a normal delivery for me was unbelievable. Like every woman who is worried about- doctors recommending c section even if we are capable of having a normal delivery; this thought was on top of my mind. But trust me, even when my family and me asked for c section or asked to epidural procedure due to delivery pains, doctor denied and insisted for a normal delivery and she successfully made it even when there were 3 loops of chord around my son\u2019s neck.. Hats off to you and your team Ma\u2019am \ud83d\ude0d you will always be remembered for your work!! Wish you all the success in your life. May many many more people benefit from your service. Thank God for making this happen through you. \nThanks a ton Ma\u2019am \ud83d\ude0d lots of luv!!",

NORMAL delivery with Fibroids and without Epidural... Really unbelievable..\nBut it wouldn't be possible without Dr. Pavan Prakash. Hats off to her patience and positivity. No words to express my gratitude...\nMy heart felt thanks to her.\nAnd I strongly recommend her...\n\n\nThe hospital is every well maintained.

My pregnancy was critical since we were in the middle of peak Covid pandemic and Dr Pavana was very helpful in putting down my fears.  \nThe OT staff and post delivery nursing care at Ovum is very good and the hospital maintained hygiene and cleanliness during the Covid period.\nI will definitely suggest Dr Pavana and Ovum hospital for expecting mothers.

Throughout my pregnancy she gave lots of courage , care and concern which I'll never forget. I can say that she is the best gynecologist having full of patience to listen our doubts and clear them.
