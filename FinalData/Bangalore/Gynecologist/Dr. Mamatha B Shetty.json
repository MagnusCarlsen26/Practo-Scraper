I had normal delivery 1 week ago. Our baby had umbilical cord surrounded to his neck because of which it was longest 19 hours labor and Dr Mamatha mam waited throughout the time by cancelling all her other evening OPD appointments and she was supporting me to have normal delivery as all other health parameters were good. Dr Mamatha mam kept her patience and we delivered a healthy baby through normal delivery process. She is truly exceptional and one of the best doctor we have ever seen.\n\nWe are very grateful and thankful for Dr. Mamatha Shetty from Cloudnine HRBR hospital.",

Highly recommend to anyone looking for an OBGYN with great response and treatment.\nShe's full of positivity and enthusiasm. Doctor is available 24/7, she can be called/texted any time of the day. I would have called her at least 10 times during the last 9 months between 12AM - 4AM and not once was she frustrated. In fact, I was shocked when she happily told me what to do when I was confused/stressed due to something that I had no idea about as it was my first pregnancy. Mine was an emergency c-section; however, she kept trying till the last minute for a normal delivery.\nWe are forever grateful to doctor Mamatha Shetty for bringing our little bundle of joy into this world with utmost precaution and care. She's an angel sent from heavens for women. Some people choose their profession but with her it always feels that gynaecology chose her.  There are enough stressed women with complicated hormones, struggling to understand and Dr. Mamatha is that fairy Godmother with her magic wand who exactly knows what to do.\n\nI've referred a few of my friends to her and everyone had only nice things to say about her.\n\nKeep up the good work.

As my liver enzyme level was too high I visited her randomly to get the report and found her very nice enough to continue treatment. Dr. Mamtha is a wonderful person, caring, and was always available on the phone whenever I needed her support.It was only because of her continuous mental support and confidence that I was able to go for a normal delivery at the age of 39. I would not have gotten through it without you. Thank you so much for helping us through this journey and bringing our little prince into this world. I am privileged to have a doctor like her and would highly recommend her",

Whenever we visited her, she listened to us patiently and answered all our queries, also examined us with utmost diligence. She encouraged us and supported us to have normal delivery. I had normal delivery 1 week ago. Our baby had umbilical cord surrounded to his neck because of which it was longest 19 hours labor and Dr Mamatha mam waited throughout the time by cancelling all her other evening OPD appointments and she was supporting me to have normal delivery as all other health parameters were good. Dr Mamatha mam kept her patience and we delivered a healthy baby through normal delivery process. She is truly exceptional and one of the best doctor we have ever seen.\n\nWe are very grateful and thankful for Dr. Mamatha Shetty from Cloudnine HRBR hospital.",

I would have called her at least 10 times during the last 9 months between 12AM - 4AM and not once was she frustrated. In fact, I was shocked when she happily told me what to do when I was confused/stressed due to something that I had no idea about as it was my first pregnancy. Mine was an emergency c-section; however, she kept trying till the last minute for a normal delivery.\nWe are forever grateful to doctor Mamatha Shetty for bringing our little bundle of joy into this world with utmost precaution and care. She's an angel sent from heavens for women. Some people choose their profession but with her it always feels that gynaecology chose her.  There are enough stressed women with complicated hormones, struggling to understand and Dr. Mamatha is that fairy Godmother with her magic wand who exactly knows what to do.\n\nI've referred a few of my friends to her and everyone had only nice things to say about her.\n\nKeep up the good work.

It was great experience as I have delivered healthy baby through normal vaginal delivery (NVD)  on 20 may 2021. During pandemic, I was struggling to get good Gyn then my friend asked to visit her, started my consultation from third month with Dr Mamtha. She is very knowledgeable, experienced and friendly as well as approachable though Whatsapp, which made my pregnancy journey more smooth during covid time. I was not particular till last moment that I will be having baby by normal or c section. Doc was sure that she will take care if it's normal or c section. Baby was having head in pelvic area, she decided to go for normal. I had full term baby (39 week 5 days). I was getting contraction irregularly so visited doc on 19 may, my water broke the moment I reach to hospital. I got admitted and she had made my admission process smooth. She monitored me for 3-4 hour and gave one harmone injection which will increase pain and contractions regular (as there was no need to inject pain) . I was shifted to labor room after 4 hours then pain was unbearable so gone ahead with epidural ( doc asked if u can bear pain then u may avoid the epidural injection but if u think it's unbearable go ahead. Dilation was only 3 cm only ) I chose for epidural with less dose so my pain was reduced for only 3 hours then I had very painful labor pain till midnight. She has coordinated with entire team and gave couple of more injection to make dilation faster and cervix smooth. This was really needed as after epidural also dilation was only 5 cm. She has prepared the entire team for delivery in midnight when dilation was 8 cm. She came to labour room in midnight when I was almost ready, her Cloudnine team was ready too with full preparation. Doc along with her team and my husband ( who was present during entire delivery and that's a best part) has helped me to push the baby down, at the end I lost my energy and my baby\u2019s head was stuck in cervix. Then there was one sister who was another a angel to me, she has pushed the baby out from her hand by hitting hard above my tummy. Everyone was shouting that I shall try more otherwise vaccume will be used as baby heartbeat was going down. I got scared and Thank God I was able to push the healthy baby out.IFinally I had given birth to wonderful beautiful daughter :) Thanks to doc Mamtha, her entire Cloudnine HRBR Team. ",

A very big thanks to Dr. Mamatha Shetty for treating me from the day we were planning for the baby till my delivery. \nI visted doctor for the guidence when we started planning for a baby, with no doubt she guided us with all pre-medication and pre checkups. I conceived within next 3 month itself.She has lot of patience and is very comfortable to talk too. She spends enough time during visits to clarify our doubts and is also available over phone anytime we reach out to her.I always feel safe and secure when i visit her.Also, I had informed mam about my preference of Normal Vaginal delivery from the beginning- she was very practical and during labour- she didn\u2019t force anything on to us.she was calm and very positive and this is her best quality. There was a complication where the amiotic fuild level was going down during 37th week of my pregnancy and there was a single loop of cord around my baby neck. With lot of dignity Dr.mamatha explained us the situation and suggested the next steps. She made sure i deliver safely. During labour with so much of contractions i wanted to give up and go for C-section in middle. However Dr.Mamatha motivated me during labour and did normal delivery. everything was possible because of Doctor Mamatha.\n\nHighly recommended for one who is looking for Best Gynaecologist in Bangalore with great response and support. \nShe is very supportive, friendly, highly experienced, responsive and communicated well throughout my pregnancy journey and now in my post delivery aswell.\n\nShe is the best doctor I have seen ever.\n\nThanks a lot to you Ma'am !!!",

In 2020 I had visited her clinic 6 months post Cesarean as my internal stitches had still not recovered completely and also I was experiencing a strange tingling muscle pain in my joints which became unbearable gradually. I had delivered at a different hospital. Upon visit she identified my health issues and gave an apt solution to the same. I had gained excess weight during pregnancy which in turn slowed down my recovery process and also had some deficiency in the body. Dr. planned an excellent diet for me to reduce weight keeping in mind that I am breastfeeding as well. I can happily say that I have reduced 12 kgs in a span of just 2 months and I feel so lively and confident again. I have forgotten the pain I had suffered from for 6 months post delivery. She is a great Doc. Thank you Dr. Mamatha Shetty. I am really grateful to you Doc. Dear all, it is very very very important to have a proper diet pre and post pregnancy and Dr. Mamatha Shetty really helps with the same. Do consult her.In 2023 when I conceived my second one she has always been available when I need her and the best thing about her service is that she becomes your strength and helps you through your pre and post pregnancy days like it's a cakewalk. I am always awestruck by this woman and to add to this I was really amazed when on the day of my operation (early morning operation) madam visited the hospital again past midnight to check on me and her other patients.She is a very hard working, professional and experienced doctor. She worships her job \ud83d\ude4f Words can't describe what she means to me and my family. She is truly a form of God.",

Barring the mishap, I was sure my third pregnancy was going to be easier but boy was I in for a huge surprise! I was put on hormonal tablets to sustain the pregnancy from the get go. Around  13 weeks when I met Dr. Mamtha, my cervix length was a big concern, it was 3 cm. I was immediately advised complete bed rest and regular scans and injections. Doctor kept tabs on the cervix length! To add to this I had nausea and constipation to the highest degr. I would message and call her often and she was always there for me. \n\nDr. Mamtha was always prepared to see any anomaly through, she prepared me for a pre term delivery as it was quite imminent. Luckily and with all the efforts of the doctor and my family, I carried my daughter till 39 weeks. I had a huge fibroid around 10cm which was obstructing the babys head to fix into the pelvis. But she was very sure of trying the best for a vaginal birth and even a c section would have proven tasking due to my fibroid. \n\nMy amniotic fluid was lesser than expected at 39 weeks and so was induced labour. From the time I was induced, the doctor hand held me throughout my labour. Dr. Mamtha did everything to speed up my labour and when she saw that i was exhausted and wasn't dilating fast enough, she suggested that i take an epidural and sleep for a couple of hours. It was the best decision ever to have taken, my nap in the labour ward is my best nap so far! When I woke up after 2 hours or so, my contractions were strong and Dr. Mamtha and her entire team was ready to deliver my baby. Within a few pushes, she helped my baby out, despite my babys head still not being in the apt position! \n\nDr. Mamtha, being so thorough and knowledgeable, is surprisingly humble, friendly and approachable! I was so at ease with her within a few minutes of our first meeting. She doesn't fuss about a quick scan or an overnight call. She made sure I was informed of delays in appointments if she was in emergency cases. Also, the day my daughter was born was the doctors birthday, yet she was there from midnight till the wee hours of the morning. She visited me multiple times after the delivery to check on my recovery. Im so so grateful that God put me with the most capable hands! ",

Many times I had asked her queries through WhatsApp and she had responded in due time.\nI had a long labour and with her constant support in OT, I gave birth to my little angel through vaginal(normal) delivery.\nDr Shetty is undoubtedly a very talented, experienced gynaecologist doing great service to the profession.

The same day we have decided not to go for the 2nd opinion with any other doctor. Whatever she says, we followed. Multiple times we have visited her. Within a few weeks we have got good news.\nAfter 1st scanning, we got a little shock because my wife's cervix length was short. Again Dr. Mamta shetty asked us to go with the cervix stitch and bed rest. My wife was really nervous. Again our doctor did a great job for us. \nMy wife used to get motivation whenever we met our doctor. Finally we passed 38 week.\nMy wife was really in nervous to remove the cervix stitch. It was paining for her while tried to remove the stitch.\nSuddenly labour pain started and admitted to the hospital. And my wife was asking for c section because of that pain. Our doctor did a wonderful job for us in few minutes ( in less than 15minute). You will not believe its NORMAL DELIVERY.\n\nA big YES to recommend Dr. Mamatha Shetty",

So this pregnancy was very precious to me and my family. Dr Mamatha is very calm, friendly and always available for any queries. She proactively follows up for all tests, medicines, vaccines and exercise during pregnancy. She made me feel safe and secure during my delivery. I was scared of vaginal delivery. However she motivated me to go for normal delivery. \nWhen I was admitted in the hospital, my dilation was very slow, I had to wait for almost 2 days to fully dilate. I had given up after a day and asked the doctor for c-section delivery. She motivated me to wait for more time and delivered normally only. Those had been the longest hours in my life and she was there to support me. My baby had 2 cords around his neck. However, the doctor made sure I delivered normally and safely. I would definitely recommend her.",

Initially before I met her I had a narrow belief that I should go straight with C-section rather than normal which I thought was very difficult and painful(though it is) , but Dr Mamatha changed the perspective of it and suggested that the decision of C section or normal delivery should be made only on the final stages of labour depending upon the conditions and favours of the patient. We had a normal delivery though :) . I have seen from my friends who were also pregnant and confused with the doctors they chose during pregnancy, many of them changed the doctors because they were not comfortable with them, But I can strongly recommend Dr Mamtha Shetty to my friends and family, or whoever reading this.... We are thankful for all her help and support.",

This wouldn't have been possible without the supervision of our renowned Dr.Mamatha B. Shetty ma'am. One of my friends referred me to Dr.Mamatha when we were planning to have a baby. Though we had a few complications in having a baby, with no doubt she guided us with all pre medication and pre-check-ups, and i conceived naturally within the next three months itself. She has been more than a doctor in my pregnancy journey. She is very knowledgeable, friendly, has a pleasant personality, has a lot of patience and is very comfortable talking. She spends enough time during visits to clarify any sort of query or doubt. We truly enjoyed our pregnancy journey with her, and we are blessed with a healthy baby. We are extremely greatful to her and couldn't thank  her enough.We highly recommend Dr. Mamatha Shetty for those who are expecting to be parents.",

She was available for every emergency even at night time. from day one till delivery we were consulting her only.\nshe has given all facilities and information to help with normal delivery.

With so much research and practo reviews we finalized three doctors and visited them in person, and somehow we instantly connected so well with Dr. Mamatha Shetty, she\u2019s full of positive energy, highly experienced and very friendly. Best part is she explains everything in layman\u2019s term and answer your every doubts, also you can reach her anytime on her mobile. Its because of Dr. Mamatha that we decided to stay back in Bangalore and have our delivery here rather going to hometown. She made my pregnancy journey wonderful and memorable, towards the end of my pregnancy instead of me she started following me up on my health (how sweet \ud83d\ude0a), I got into mild labour 4 days before my delivery and for the next 3 days she\u2019d check me once in the morning and come around 11pm to hospital just to check on my NST and then finally on 8th Dec 2021 we had our girl baby (rainbow baby) through normal delivery. From the bottom of my heart, I thank Dr. Mamatha and I highly recommend Dr. Mamatha for your precious pregnancy journey.\n\n",

I'm married for 9 yrs now, where I had lost all my hope for my pregnancy after all the efforts of trying for conceiving, but with her counseling I started the treatment and the result was very immediate where I conceived with a month's treatment. As the day passed, she invigilated me closely as I had a previous history\u00a0 of miscarriage n abortion. She made sure the baby n myself are doing well with a constant follow up and then d day arrives for my delivery, where I'm blessed with a baby girl on 28th Oct with her guidance in a normal process. she motivated me to go for a normal delivery, which I preferred\u00a0 personally. Even though my labor was a roller coaster ride for me n d doctor, she was there with me as an all time support which helped me to deliver a healthy baby girl. I'm thankful to her support, guidance, kindness, responsiveness and her friendly gesture n I'm blessed to consult d best doctor. I will again say I would\u00a0 highly recommend her if anyone looking for infertility or gynaec related.",

You always go above and beyond and work tirelessly towards a healthy outcome. We feel so blessed to know you and have you as our doctor during the pandemic time. \n\nThank you for delivering [Jasmika] and all the care leading up to the delivery. My wife Ramya has recovered well and appreciate all the advice and tips you gave her beforehand about how to deliver a baby. The class you recommended at Cloud Nine Hospital was fantastic and helped her to feel less anxious about the process. \n\nHaving delivery, labor pain (blah blah) is scary for a new couple, knowing that there is a risk that something can go wrong. I\u2019m thankful for all you did to have a normal delivery as the world is now perplexed with normal delivery as that of C- Section.  My baby is doing well here today because of your efforts. I will always be grateful for what you did. \n\nYou deserve B. C. Roy Award for your dedication and perseverance. ALL THE VERY BEST. ",

She was always available on calls even during odd times. I was a person who was even very fearful about injection but Dr so was friendly which helped me to build confidence and had Normal delivery. Thank you so much Dr Mamatha Shetty and the entire nursing team of the hospital who were available all the time post delivery. The hospital stay and the labor experience was pleasant for us. I got into labor within 5 hrs and could deliver the baby. House Keeping, Nursing,Staff Behaviour,Dr consultation,Lactation consultation,All the services were excellent.I would definitely choose the same for my Second delivery. If it happens \ud83d\ude09.",

Either it be day or night she is available for all my queries. I would highly recommend her, if anyone looking  for the best gynaecologist. I have a kid who was 6 when we started planning and followed up with the best names in town for 4 years but all in vein, and I had lost all my hope for my pregnancy. I went to Dr Mamatha who was referred by one of my friend and I found her approach extremely different from what others used to talk. She never said I was overweight or due to PCOS it will not happen. She started the treatment in a phased manner and striked out every possible cause. I remember it was my 4th visit and she said congratulations!! It was like a dream come true after struggling so many years. She made sure the baby and myself are doing well with a constant follow up and then the day arrives for my delivery, where I'm blessed with a baby boy on 8th Oct with her guidance in a normal process. I always used to ask her \"Ma'am, I hope it will be a normal delivery only\" I am afraid even of an injection and she was like you just relax, everything will be normal only. Even though my labor was a roller coaster ride for me n d doctor, she was there with me as an all time support which helped me to deliver a healthy baby. I was not able to bear the pain and asking her to make it painless but she was like stay calm, you can make it. I'm thankful to her support, guidance, kindness, responsiveness and her friendly gesture and I am blessed to consult the **** doctor.",

She takes in our requests and provides solutions around it- which showcases her qualities.\nAlso, I had informed her about my preference of Normal Vaginal delivery from the beginning- she was very practical and during labour- she didn\u2019t force anything on to us.. she was calm and very positive and this is her best quality. I had a Normal Delivery. And she ensured this could happen., keeping the best team around. Super grateful to have chosen her as my gynaecologist.\nThank you Dr Mamatha!",

By God's grace she did normal delivery which is hard to find with any of the doctor in Bangalore today.She is always energetic and advice what is required. Thanks a ton Mam. For all the expecting mother just visit Mamta mam once you will feel the difference. But before visiting call and take the appointment as you might have to wait if it is a walk-in (non emergency).

She never asked for any unwanted tests, no unnecessary medication and would try to explain everything in such a detailed manner. During labour and delivery she was always with us monitoring everything. She was the one who took the first pic with my LO. So glad and very happy we found her. ",

Right from the beginning to delivery she has managed each and everything very smoothly and always helped on call or WhatsApp. \n\nDuring the peak Corona second wave, we got admitted for delivery. The hospital was under strict protocols to prevent the spread of corona which is awesome.\n\nHousekeeping was prompt and maintained the hygiene in all nooks and corners of the facility.\n\nI can go on and write endlessly about Dr. Mamatha. Just one word about her \"Eyes closed just go to her, you will be happier that you have chosen the right person for welcoming your new bundle of joy to your family\".  \n\nHighly recommending Cloudnine HRBR to any expecting couple.",

During my 2nd month I started to bleed and I was really scared and nervous and when I asked about this with Dr. and she was not able to tell the reason why I was bleeding and she was literally ignored me. Then I decided to change my doctor and met Dr. Mamatha who is very talented as well as down to earth kind of person. She treated me like a elder sister by giving  mental support and hope. She treated me with **** medicines and proper guidance. And within a month I was cured and I was started to gain weight. I am really thankful to Dr. Mamatha shetty and I fully recommend her to all moms especially who has complications like me. She is a wonderful human being *** *** **** *******",

Her beautiful smile and gentle work in doing procedures do all the miracle and gives a lot of strength to the patient. My sister underwent a cesarean during her first pregnancy with a different doctor. However for her second pregnancy when we consulted Mrs Mamatha Shetty, she gave an assurance with the best of capabilities to perform a normal delivery. As situations prevailed close to her due date, her decision making and motivational actions made a way to a safe and a normal delivery above all possibilities of cesarean. Truly appreciate her work because any other doctor in her place would have performed a c-section. Thank you doctor.",

Thanks to her insight and care,I cannot imagine a more supportive, brilliant gynaecologist. When I found out that delivery would be a struggle she made both my husband and myself extremely comfortable during that stressful situation. She never once make us feel rushed. Her attention and dedication was the same high level during my first consultation, as it was during my last appointment. She always responded to my every phone and message. Dr. Mamatha was absolutely  fabulous on both a personal and professional level.  I would strongly recommend her to any family and friend without hesitation. She truly cares about her patients. Thank you Ma'am for your outstanding  support. I can't express to you what that meant to me. Please don't ever change. You are the perfect Doctor. ",

This is exactly what we expect from a doctor as most of the terms and jargons are not understandable to a layman. She helped us throughout our 9 months and we truly felt blessed to have a baby girl \nDr. Mamatha explained everything and took the right decision at right time. Another good thing is she is available on weekends, We strongly recommend Dr. Mamatha for everyone. She would make sure your journey to parenthood is as smooth as it can get.",

One can discuss about all the doubts/problems freely and get proper response from her. My journey of 2nd pregnancy was very nice in her hands. Had a normal delivery at Cloud nine Sahakar Nagar which was possible for me just because of her confident soothing words.\nShe'll suggest some simple remedies for common issues like nausea, weakness, backache etc during pregnancy. Her support during delivery is also amazing. \nPost delivery consultation also went well. I can refer her to anyone for pleasant pregnancy and delivery experience. ",

You are one of the best doctors I have ever met. You are so dedicated to your services where a patient feels safe under your care. All the very best and I am certainly going to consult you for all my gynecological needs. Thank you so much for all the care and wonderful treatment. \nXoXo \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

We recieved lots of care from Dr. Mamatha Shetty during delivery and in hospital as well. She is always reachable whenever we have even minor health issues despite of her busy schedule. I strongly recommend Dr. Mamatha Shetty, for  those who have very complexity in their pregnancy and needed mental support. She is always very kind and welcoming in nature. ",
