"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I cannot express enough how grateful I am for the incredible care that my wife received from Dr. Thejaswini. From the very first visit to the last, Dr. Thejaswini has been an absolute godsend. Her dedication to her patients and her unwavering commitment to their well-being is truly remarkable.

First and foremost, Dr. Thejaswini's warm and compassionate demeanor immediately puts patients at ease. She takes the time to listen attentively, addressing all concerns and questions with patience and empathy. This level of genuine care goes a long way in reducing the anxiety that often accompanies visits to a gynecologist.

What sets Dr. Thejaswini apart is her exceptional ability to educate and empower her patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of my wife's treatment, making sure we fully understood the options and decisions ahead. This transparency was invaluable in helping us make informed choices regarding our healthcare.

One of Dr. Thejaswini's most remarkable qualities is her conscientious approach to medical care. She firmly believes in not prescribing unnecessary medicines or tests. She said ""You don't need a doctor; you need a dietician first,"" embodies her commitment to addressing the root causes of health issues rather than relying solely on medications. This approach demonstrates her dedication to the long-term health and well-being of her patients.

Thank you, Dr. Thejaswini, for being the incredible doctor that you are, and for making such a positive impact on our lives.

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"For my pregnancy , I had consulted Dr. Thejaswini J. with a very skeptical mind in the beginning. The reason has nothing to do with her skill-set but since I had not known her before. But it didn’t take time to change my mind and become very comfortable with her. She was ready to entertain all my doubts and queries about pregnancy. Unlike others without any hesitation, she shared her personal number to call her in case of need at odd hours. My first pregnancy tenure went on very smooth under her guidance. Upon her advice, my weight gain check and pre -natal yoga really helped to keep me fit till the very end. Her habit of checking the weight & pulse rate herself instead of a nurse gave a very personal feel n developed our bond stronger. During delivery, her constant encouragement helped me to get through the painful process of labour. Later it was my baby’s decision to come by the c-section way. Dr. Thejaswini was confident, dedicated and absolutely skillful to operate on me . Under complications, I am absolutely thankful for a safe delivery of my beautiful daughter. Even after delivery, her routine checks used to add very friendly notes” Stop wearing these hospital clothes, you are all fine, wear regular clothes”! This really made me feel at home.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Was fortunate enough to find her. What a gem of person and professional ma’am is. 

She was consulting doctor through my wife’s pregnancy and there was no one better I could’ve wished for. Now I will tell my reason in the most layman’s perspective 

1. Very grounded in her approach and would only make the necessary recommendation in terms of medicines or scans, so one can be assured if Dr has prescribed it then it is of utmost importance and not for the pharmacy or the scan clinics profits as sometimes people are apprehensive about.

2. Listens and encourages you throughout your journey, without you ever feeling if she is rushing into things

3. Approachable for people from all kinds of economic strata in the society.

4. Will never hint at or even make a passing reference of C Section unless absolutely necessary, will encourage you and give your tips for natural delivery right from day 1.

5. She helped us naturally deliver a healthy baby boy in Columbia Asia Sarjapur after my wife went in labour 24 hours after her water broke. She insisted on not going the c section route or even giving epidurals as she said that the vitals are all good and natural route is best one at this stage even when my wife said that the pain was unbearable, she held her hand and encouraged her to be the most comfortable position to push, which the nurse weren’t allowing (squat position).

"Doctor friendliness,Wait time,Value for money,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"Hello,

First of all, thanks to PRACTO for allowing me to give my feedback.

I am the husband of the patient. This was the first time, I made use of PRACTO services or check-up related to my wife in Bangalore. I had nice experience with my previous doctor at hometown based in UP earlier.
I decided to make a visit to this clinic after checking reviews online in Practo. But, I found the scenario very different post the visit. I booked appointment for 7:20 PM for 5 Jan 2019; however, I received a call from clinic on same day in afternoon that doctor would come late and so, they rescheduled my appointment for 8:20 PM. I reached clinic at 8:05 PM and found that doctor was already there. Receptionist told that my appointment was for 7:20 PM not for 8:20. Due to this, I waited till 9:45 PM because a lot of patients were there in queue, but I believed that if my appointment was rescheduled properly, I didn't have to wait for long there.
Secondly, I found some sort of aggression within the doctor. I usually found the doctor in hurry and for this, she didn't exhibit much concern/cooperation for our problems. 
I usually have a habit to ask questions with doctors, but literally I didn't find much encouragement from the doctor's side. I understand that in pregnancy, a lot of questions are there which a normal person won't appreciate but anyhow, it is doctor's responsibility to encourage the patients for asking questions. Obviously, this was missing from the doctor's side. 

Pros:

1. The doctor prescribed some tests there, which I found correct as per the situation.

Cons:

1. Wait time was literally very high
2. Doctor friendliness was very limited. (I found the doctor with a lot of attitude)
3. Doctor cooperation was very limited
4. Doctor was reluctant, most often, answering questions I made.
4. They are charging consultation fee for every visit
On 5th Jan '19, they charged 300/- and on 7th Jan '19 they charged 50/-; though, it is a minimal amount but I never found it with other doctors. There should be time period made by clinic/hospital in which consultation fees should be chargeable.

Because of the aforementioned reasons, I decided not to make any further visit to this clinic again. I'm sorry, but I didn't find any further reason to appreciate anything about the doctor or clinic.

Thanks.",2019-01-08 06:21:51,False,False,VANDANA SINGH,,,

There are no unnecessary tests or medications advised.Through out pregnancy, she has been very supportive, approachable and and always have heard if there were any doubts and concerns and also her patience is highly appreciated. I had a normal delivery and something that I noticed was Dr never spoke of C-section or even mentioned about it any point, only thing she suggested was do regular exercises, so that it would help during delivery. So it's not that all doctors suggest C-section, atleast not in case of Dr Tejaswini, unless it's a need depending on patients health condition and baby's position.Post pregnancy care was also extremely good. I had developed breast absses post devilery and she went out of her way to get my dressing done and make sure the absses would heal faster.

But, they simply refused to speak to the customer care executive. The staff and even the doctor misbehaved with me and spoke in a loud tone pointing fingers at us.

After waiting for 15-20 more minutes, I again went and checked with them about the status. This time they even stopped responding to me which was not at all a gentleman’s gesture. Looking at all this, I tried questioning them further but without any satisfactory answer. I even called at Practo customer care where the customer care executive heard my concerns and asked me to handover the phone to the receptionist. But, they simply refused to speak to the customer care executive. The staff and even the doctor misbehaved with me and spoke in a loud tone pointing fingers at us. I am really saddened to see such things happening at a place where sensitive things like childbirth, gynae problems and motherhood are handled.
