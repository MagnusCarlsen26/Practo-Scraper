"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I met Dr Anupama Ashok at Columbia Asia Hospital last year. I was diagnosed with Endometriosis which led to infertility. After couple of laparoscopic procedures we met Dr Anupama Ashok. She was very understanding in everything and always tried to boost my morale. I was such a girl who was scared of TVS at the first stage but by her support and patient handling we could complete our treatment successfully. Doctor was very clear of the procedures, is she was sure of a particular treatment not working she wouldn't suggest or want to try that and she saves time and money, initially doctor had advised for 3 cycles of IUI but as I had increased complications due to multiple endometric cysts Doctor took a call after one cycle of IUI and we immediately started off with IVF with out wasting any time. Every single scan and procedures were handled with much care and she made all efforts to be less painful and made me very much comfortable through out the treatment. We had one cycle of IVF and I m blessed with twins now. Doctor also goes an extra mile to monitor patients records when we had to do clinical tests for the procedures, she would always follow it up for results much before we get to know the results this was very surprising as a doctor who meets 50 patients everyday is able to give individual attention and preferences. She was also available on phone for any kind of emergency situations. I would definitely recommend Dr. Anupama Ashok for anyone who is struggling with infertility issues. She is been a blessing to us. We feel lucky that we were in the right hands and still it feels unbelievable that I could also conceive  with so many complications . All thanks to the Doctor.
