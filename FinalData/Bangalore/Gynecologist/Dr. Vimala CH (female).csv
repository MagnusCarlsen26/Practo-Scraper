She explains the solutions in easily understandable manner (in layman terms). Always available for any help over mobile if anything urgent. 

More importantly, she highly prefers normal delivery and encourages required exercises if necessary. We were about to get baby delivered 1 month early but with her proper guidance (many thanks!), we are blessed with healthy baby girl at the right week.

We went to Dr. Vimala when we were told to proceed with the abortion or terminate the baby by our previously consulting doctor from a well-known hospital.
Dr. Vimala gave us hope, did the necessary tests and scans, and told us not to worry too much and to trust her throughout the pregnancy, even though it was a high-risk pregnancy.
End result after trusting Dr. Vimala:
gave birth to a very beautiful baby girl with no complications and a normal delivery.
Thanks to the doctor, this baby is like a gift from Dr. Vimala to us. I don't think we would have continued with the pregnancy if we had consulted any other doctors after all the complications that I mentioned above.

Carefully listens to all pregnancy history and takes more time to go through all the past medical records. She makes patient very comfortable, clears all the doubts and confusions, for sure she never let you out with questions. She treats you very well, she has a way of making you feel like you‚Äôre not just a patient.
She is very quick responsive over Wats-up and keeps following up/monitor from her side. She never suggests any unnecessary tests and medications. Her aim is always delivering a healthy baby in normal delivery. I really felt in control over the situation and was able to use her as an educated resource to help me make the best decision possible.
Due to some reason, I had to change doctor at 8th month of my pregnancy, I was very afraid about this. But once we Consulted Vimala Madam, I was very happy and got confidence that I have chosen right person. I never thought that, I will have normal delivery, but it happened only with the help of Dr. Vimala Madam. I was very afraid of labor pains, but it went very well and smooth with her support. The procedure and the treatment she offered was awesome. She went above and beyond during my labor, finally I gave birth to healthy baby girl through NVD without epidural.
