Dr. Dhivya is a highly skilled gynecologist who provided exceptional care throughout my pregnancy journey. From the very beginning, she was approachable, friendly, and put me at ease with her warm demeanor.\n\nDr. Dhivya is a great listener, and she took the time to understand my concerns and questions. She provided clear explanations and made sure that I fully understood my options at every step of the process. She also encouraged me to ask questions and never made me feel rushed or pressured.\n\nDuring my delivery, Dr. Dhivya was calm, professional, and reassuring. She provided me with the support and guidance I needed to have a smooth and safe delivery. Even during a challenging moment, she remained calm and focused, which helped me to stay calm too.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Dr. Dhivya for anyone looking for a caring and approachable gynecologist who is highly skilled in maternity and delivery care. She is an exceptional doctor who truly cares about her patients and goes above and beyond to provide the best possible care. Thank you, Dr. Dhivya, for everything you did for me and my family!",

I would like to share my story so that anyone who falls under my category can be benefited. Based on Google reviews, we visited the doctor for irregular periods and planning maternity. Upon checking my conditions, it is discovered that I had PCOD and hormonal imbalances, in addition to that I have chronic hypothyroidism and was in medication for that. Doctor was very clear with her step by step approach. For first 4 months i was administered some medications to regularise the hormonal imblances.then on 6th month, got pregnant naturally. During the covid days, she was always available to instruct us on things over call and online consultation. Doctor was very patient to explain all our queries. successfully delivered the baby even when I had multiple complications. Only one thing we did was to trust her and followed her advices accordingly. sincere thanks once again ",

We're now feeling quite let down. The doctor didn't show there until 11.45 am despite the fact that our appointment was supposed to start at 10.15 am. The doctor just wanted us to repeat the same process even though we still had all of the earlier prescriptions from our previous gynaecologist. We still had all of our previous gynecologist's prescriptions and the most recent lab results, despite this. The doctor seemed a little mute when we asked her questions. We wasted our time, and we won't go back to see this gynaecologist.  How can someone who doesn't respect others' time give excellent advice to others?",

She has always been available on call even in odd hours. Our baby Girl got delivered on 30th Dec, 2021. It is a normal delivery. Thanks to Dr. Dhivya and support staff.Her friendliness, clear communication and the care received from the Doctor is beyond expectations. Apart from everything she is as a doctor, she is a great human being and gives a sense of security (sense of being in safe hands), when she is around.We highly recommend Dr. Dhivya R.

Dr. Dhivya is a highly skilled gynecologist who provided exceptional care throughout my pregnancy journey. From the very beginning, she was approachable, friendly, and put me at ease with her warm demeanor.\n\nDr. Dhivya is a great listener, and she took the time to understand my concerns and questions. She provided clear explanations and made sure that I fully understood my options at every step of the process. She also encouraged me to ask questions and never made me feel rushed or pressured.\n\nDuring my delivery, Dr. Dhivya was calm, professional, and reassuring. She provided me with the support and guidance I needed to have a smooth and safe delivery. Even during a challenging moment, she remained calm and focused, which helped me to stay calm too.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Dr. Dhivya for anyone looking for a caring and approachable gynecologist who is highly skilled in maternity and delivery care. She is an exceptional doctor who truly cares about her patients and goes above and beyond to provide the best possible care. Thank you, Dr. Dhivya, for everything you did for me and my family!",

I would like to share my story so that anyone who falls under my category can be benefited. Based on Google reviews, we visited the doctor for irregular periods and planning maternity. Upon checking my conditions, it is discovered that I had PCOD and hormonal imbalances, in addition to that I have chronic hypothyroidism and was in medication for that. Doctor was very clear with her step by step approach. For first 4 months i was administered some medications to regularise the hormonal imblances.then on 6th month, got pregnant naturally. During the covid days, she was always available to instruct us on things over call and online consultation. Doctor was very patient to explain all our queries. successfully delivered the baby even when I had multiple complications. Only one thing we did was to trust her and followed her advices accordingly. sincere thanks once again ",

We're now feeling quite let down. The doctor didn't show there until 11.45 am despite the fact that our appointment was supposed to start at 10.15 am. The doctor just wanted us to repeat the same process even though we still had all of the earlier prescriptions from our previous gynaecologist. We still had all of our previous gynecologist's prescriptions and the most recent lab results, despite this. The doctor seemed a little mute when we asked her questions. We wasted our time, and we won't go back to see this gynaecologist.  How can someone who doesn't respect others' time give excellent advice to others?",

She has always been available on call even in odd hours. Our baby Girl got delivered on 30th Dec, 2021. It is a normal delivery. Thanks to Dr. Dhivya and support staff.Her friendliness, clear communication and the care received from the Doctor is beyond expectations. Apart from everything she is as a doctor, she is a great human being and gives a sense of security (sense of being in safe hands), when she is around.We highly recommend Dr. Dhivya R. Once again Thank you doctor for everything.",

Best part is she was always reachable and she never recommends unnecessary tests nor advices for extra medication if it can be cured by natural food. During my pregnancy i was affected with covid and during that time also she was vry supportive. She informed us earlier only that there are chances of pre-delivery . In 34th week of pregnancy my water got broke and we were highly tensed and from the time we informed her, she was following us vry regularly. By the time we reached hospital she was available and took care of evrything and after some tests she explained us the situation and in next 2 hours baby boy was born . Currently me and baby boy both are doing gud. Thank you so much doctor",
