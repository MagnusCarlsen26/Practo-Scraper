We meet Dr. Aparna Panda after we lost our hope (miscarriage). Me and my wife were totally depressed after the miscarriage. We didn't even knew what to do next.

We searched in Google for best Gynecologist near by and then we found Dr. Aparna Panda. On our first meet we felt relaxed after consulting with her , she explained exactly why miscarriage happened and what can be done next. Soon after talking to her, me and my wife felt very relaxed and hopeful.
She suggested some medication and asked us to visit after 2 weeks.

After 2 weeks,
My wife recovered but still she was under depression. We visited her clinic and we consulted what can be done next.
She with calm and cool mind replied us not to worry at all and she will guide us from then. We did spend a good amount of time with her and she guided us with a proper and very accurate timeline.

She advised my wife to undergo medication for hormone imbalance (which caused the miscarriage) after some tests and she gave us a strict timeline of the treatment.
But the main challenge was I had to travel abroad for 3months for urgent replace of my colleague.I was tensed because she was alone here and also for the huge loss.
Dr. Aparna Panda made sure and took a great care of my wife during her treatment period during my absence.

My wife starting feeling good , hopeful and relaxed after every meet with the doctor. She took care of my wife like her own family member. Even though I was not here she treated my wife very well and advised her what to do and what not to do.

But we had a fear in our mind that it takes long time duration to get conceived after first miscarriage and we didn't knew when we are going to be blessed.
I returned back and we meet doctor and she said everything is normal now, she waved green signal for planning.

After 2months, when we tested it was a different feeling for us. Yes it was good news and we were so happy we couldn't believe.
We meet doctor in evening and she also confirmed, that day was the most happiest day of our life.
Dr Aparna Panda treatment really has magical power and the timeline what she gave was perfect.
She recommends only necessary tests and medication.

Then She asked my wife to follow some protocols and advised many things to get things very smooth. My wife followed every word of her.
After 6th week,during scan we heard the heart beat of our baby and tears of joy in our eyes. We were so happy we couldn't still believe and then we informed our closed ones.

Times passed on and everything went very smooth. After nine months of journey we were blessed with a baby boy..through normal delivery.
Dr Aparna Pandas patience during normal delivery is really respectable. She has very good patience.

We are really very thankful to Dr Aparna Panda for treating us and taking care like member's of her family.
She turned our Hope into Real so soon , we didn't even felt that something bad had happened earlier with us.

For Dr. Aparna Panda from my wife.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I checked Dr.Aparna's profile in practo and was very much impressed by her positive reviews on normal delivery. So, we decided to consult her for pregnancy check ups, we were happy about the covid safety measures taken in her clinic.I had my own birth plan like breastfeeding in the 1st one hr, delayed cord clamping and skin to skin. Dr.Aparna agreed to all of it and I was totally satisfied when she mentioned that she practices all of it. So, we convinced our parents to have the delivery in Bangalore itself instead of our native.The pregnancy went on really smooth, did walking, squatting, yoga and was active throughout the pregnancy,ensured not to gain more weight. Doctor also promised 99% for normal delivery inspite of the low water level. She suggested us to admit in Rainbow hospital in my 37th week as the baby was in Cephalic position and 2.9 kgs of weight. I was induced on Jan 25th around 8 pm, I started getting contractions but I did not dilate. Still the doctor in the ward told we will try for normal delivery till 26th Jan 12 noon if the fetal heart rate is stable. From midnight my contractions were intense, but I dilated only 3 cm by 26th Jan around 9.30 AM. Baby was distressed by then, the fetal heart rate was going down.Dr.Aparna suggested us to go for C- section, in less then 10 mins they shifted me to the operation theater. She had a wonderful team in Rainbow children's hospital, Bannerghatta road they swiftly made all the arrangements and I delivered  a boy baby on 26th Jan, 10.19 AM.Baby was distressed, he had mild respiratory issue. He was shifted to NICU immediately, the doctors in the NICU took the necessary care. He was shifted to the ward in 30 hrs and we got discharged on 28th Jan. My sincere thanks to the doctors and the staffs in NICU for the treatment and care provided. Service provided at Rainbow hospital was impressive. Due to covid only my husband was allowed with me and this being our first pregnancy, things went on smooth because of kindness and support of the nurses in the ward throughout our stay.My sincere gratitude to Dr.Aparna for extending her support during my pregnancy and postpartum.  She was always available in watsapp to support. She is extremely professional, *** **** *** ********* *********** ********* ** ***** *** will not panic you at any time.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Here my journey starts with Dr.Aparna ma'am.
When I googled about her I found very positive reviews about normal deliy.I also read different opinions about her but I strongly recommend her name and I will tell you the reason why.
So first of all I am Dr.Renu a physiotherapist. I had to go through a phase of miscarriage in my first conception and I was very sad and worried thinking what will happen in my  second time conception.When I came to know about Dr.Aparna I decided to meet her in my 2nd month . Though I was hesitant when I met her for the first time because she didn't explain me in detail. But when I went for second visit she explained to me everything about my pregnancy and then on things started to look very nice and smooth.I started to gain trust on her.Suddenly 6th month and onwards my pregnancy had some complications like Gestational diabetes,Cholestasis jaundice,severe itching,my haemoglobin was also very low and on top of these I was overweight. Since I am from medical background I could understand these problems and tried to take care of these as per doctor's guidance.Because of my complications doctor said she will do induced labour on 37th week and try for normal delivery.But until you see your baby out and everything is fine you don't really accept everything what doctor says.I was scared and worried.Finally the day came when I had to undergo induced labour. I got admitted in Rainbow hospital, nurses started to give medicines to induced pain but my pain and dilatation was not progressing as expected till next morning.Then doctor quickly decide to break the water and checked how much i had progressed. After that my pain started to progress. I was coping up with pain by doing gentle breathing exercises. When my pain become high I started getting tired. My doctor had suggested me for epidural but I wasn't ready for it and said i will bear the pain. Being a physiotherapist I was aware of side effects of  epidural and wanted to avoid it. As my pain was progressing further I was becoming very tired and started to think if this continues I will lack with energy and won't be able to deliver normally and then I quickly decided to take epidural. By this time I had dilated only 4cm.
Now my epidural procedure went very smooth and experienced no pain after that and dilatation was progressing. After that I delivered normally.
Dr.Aparna handled my case very well. I was really amazed by her experience of handling the situation and taking quick decisions. At that moment I really felt blessed to be having my baby under her hands..I cannot thank her enough for what she did for us...I highly recommend Dr.Aparna ma'am especially to those who are looking for normal delivery in Bangalore.
After taking epidural and having painless normal delivery I strongly recommend to take epidural and enjoy painless delivery because I feel it's a blessing for people like us who do not want to take labour pain and still have smooth normal delivery.
Nowadays normal delivery is becoming a rare thing and when we get to know someone have normal delivery we feel very happy. And same happened to me. I am blessed with a baby girl weighing 2.9 kg and all because of ma'am.
Thank you so much ma'am for taking such a good care of my pregnancy..
Thanks a lot.",2021-04-10 15:49:28,False,True,Renu Kumari,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Painful Periods,Heavy Periods,PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Pregnant,Infertility in Women,",0,0,YES,"3 weeks agoI've waited too long to give this review.My relationship with Dr.Aparnaa mam began way back in March 2018 when I visited her for heavy menstruation flow and pain and with a single scan I was diagnosed with PCOS in one of my ovaries. Mam had a clear conversation with me regarding my family planning and suggested I should hold on for sometime and get treated for PCOS first so that I can conceive naturally. 6 months of treatment and I was ready to conceive. However, due to personal commitments, I had discontinued medication and consultation for a few months and tried conceiving on my own. After 3 failed attempts,I went back to Aparnaa mam for help. She immediately recognized me and had a hard talk regarding my discontinuity of medication. However, I was determined this time and with mam's help I was able to conceive within a month. My pregnancy journey has been super smooth. I was lucky enough to not have any complications and those 9 months have been the most amazing months of my life so far. I was due on April 29th and the Covid 19 situation was really getting into my nerves. On my end term scan, doctor told me that baby was in a position for normal delivery.But I was so paranoid with the lockdown situation and post recovery stories from my friends about normal delivery that I didn't want to get into any kind of emergency situation and requested mam for a planned c section. Aparnaa mam tried to explain me that every body is different and it's not necessary that I would go through the same things that my friends experienced. She was determined to have my mind set into normal delivery and she assured nothing would go wrong. As fate would have it, my water broke 2 days later , i.e on 4th April and I got admitted to Rainbow hospital immediately. Aparnaa mam visited me in the evening and explained that I had to be induced as I had not gone into labour yet. She was courteous enough to ask me if I want to get induced or go for c section. I opted to follow what she feels is right for me. 15 hours into labour but my baby was in no mood to come out 😊. Finally had to go for c section at 10am on 5th April and got blessed with a baby boy.

None,None,0,0,YES,"High Risk Pregnancy 

First time I met her was Oct 2016. I went to her adamantly wanting a cervical stitch due to a previous los. But she suggested against it and instead advised other non invasive and natural methods during pregnancy. Instead of advising us to just getting preg she asked us to do certain tests to eliminate all possibilities, advising me to fix all my dental problem, losing weight, etc etc. During my entire pregnancy she watched over my diet, my weight , my bp, my fibroids and such other factors like a hawk. She monitored me very very closely. She never ignored even the smallest factor. I knew my preg was a hard one due to my late age, overweight, multiple fibroids, previous los, tendency of G.D, bp, etc. So she put me on strict bed rest and diet. My entire preg I never put on weight, I remained the same thru entire preg. With her guidance and advice I had one of the most normal smooth easy pregnancy ever, I have known young healthy girl to have complications. But I dint have a single issue. Not one complication. She dint only advise us medically, but spoke and counseled us on a personal level. She helped us become more mature, take further responsibility, prepare us financially and most of all she turned us into parents before our baby came. She instilled the feeling of mother and father into us , always ensured we put the pregnancy and the baby first and the highest priority. I had one of the most smoothest delivery. I don’t know when it started and when it ended. Again zero complications. I was walking and resuming all my normal activities the next day. I felt no pain , no issues.  Today we are blessed with a baby and it’s all due to her guidance. I recently met her for follow up, asked her when can we try again, her answer was minimum 2 years. Any other doc would have said anything between 6months to 1year. But she saw my and my newborn’s well being first. It’s like she is allergic to money. I was paranoid during entire preg and kept asking her for some or the other thing which would have earned her a lot of money, but all she did was turn me down. Her only advise was bed rest, food and lifestyle. She is very particular about tests and scans though, to a level where she will call the scan people personally while my scan is getting done. She knew the report before it was printed. She is like an anxious mother. She does not overlook anything. She is blunt, very honest ( may seem rude), extremely ethical , disciplined , highly principled. If you are looking for a doctor who sugar coats and is very diplomatic or will provide you polite customer service, you need to go to a good hotel. Because she is only about the baby, medical and ethics. By the end of my preg she was like my family member. She is on top of all latest medical and technological updates. She does not need to look at your file, does not forget any detail. Is always available for chats on whatsapp. Towards last few weeks of my preg she was more bothered about my reports than her fees. As mine was a HR pregnancy she never bothered me to come multiple times for visits. Her only concern was my baby’s safe delivery. If every doctor in the world is like her than there will no patients. I wish she was my paediatrician,  my dentist, my physiotherapist etc etc etc. Grateful is a small word, Me, my husband and our families are indebted to her forever.

Dr. Aparnaa has been the light bearer throughout my pregnancy journey right from week 5 until week 38 when i delivered. Although she may come off as a very strict gynae, but in reality that’s exactly what is needed for a healthy pregnancy. I was at a risk of gestational diabetes and high BP but thanks to her constant vigilance and diet charting, i made it through without any need for medications at any instance for the above while being active throughout my pregnancy (driving to work until 1 week prior to delivery)

She answered each and every query of mine patiently(even with diagrams), be it originating from myths from family and friends, google-researched scientific data or just silly random thoughts in the head. One very good and convenient thing about Dr. Panda is that she remembers her patients’ history and answers all your questions on whatsapp texts.

Lastly i would like to write that had it not been her and her excellent team of practitioners in scrubs at the labour room/OT, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to have a normal vaginal delivery at any cost; given the fact that i had signed a written consent of C-section in case of emergencies.

"Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"
I would like to thank everyone who gave their reviews, which helped me decide to meet Dr. Aparna, when my wife was pregnant with our first child. Having stayed in many cities and having met many doctors for different medical problems, I usually have trust issues when it comes to medical help and it was no different even this time. I have hardly met doctors who actually believe in what they do and unless you are ready to try what they are asking of you, they tell you on your face to seek medical attention elsewhere. I respect these doctors because they take accountability of their patients and are not ready to take any chances with their health conditions. 

Dr. Aparna was happy to listen to us everytime we met her but was never inclined to make any changes for my wife's diet plan which could allow her to gain more weight. All through the pregnancy period she kept a strict watch on my wife's health and counselled both of us to make the right choices and decisions. I now understand that for a pregnant woman, her gynaecologist is somebody who she can not only open up in confidence and trust with her changes and challenges, but also someone who can create a cushion of comfort should something not go as planned. Our child's delivery happened in one of the most unplanned conditions but Dr. Aparna seemed unfazed and ensured a successful normal delivery, with both my wife and child in perfect health. She was instrumental in getting the facilities and staff ready for the delivery process even before I could fill in the in-patient documentation.

Needless to say that we were lucky to have had Dr. Aparna as my wife's gynaecologist. She has not only been there for my wife but also for our child. I was not happy with the paediatrician that we met at the hospital and was referred to for further OPD consultations. Dr. Aparna sensed that and recommended us to another child specialist. Our child is 4 months old now and we still continue to meet the same paediatrician and are very happy with his treatment. Not only do we recommend Dr. Aparna to our friends but would recommed her to anybody willing to experience a smooth and successful pregrancy with the best chances of a normal delivery, without any frown or frustration or any agonising moments of distrust. From the multiple reviews, I can understand that she has time and again offered the same experience to many couples like us and we can only be thankful for her support. Thank you very much Dr. Aparna.",2018-12-10 14:51:39,False,True,Abhijit Debroy,,,

"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"To Start, firstly we were Thankful to Dr. Aparnaa Panda for all the support during this entire journey starting from pregnancy confirmation to till NORMAL delivery. I take this opportunity to mention our experience with Dr. Aparna panda, so that it shall be useful to others , i can explain this in 3 steps...

1) Choosing right doctor: Finding right doctor is every thing that decides your entire journey, To provide best care to mother and child and we have googled and learned about as many as doctors with in radius of 20km from my place, read every review of doctors, their expertise, experience, behavior of clinic staff, waiting time, followups etc., after analyzing all the information we choose Dr Aparnaa Panda *** *** ******** **** ********* *** **** **** ** ********* she suggests only necessary things nothing else.... no unnecessary medications, no unnecessary tests or scanning..... 

2) Choosing Right Hospital: Having coming from other southern state, we planned delivery in our native place, again wanting to give best care and service i have enquired and visited few hospitals in southern states that ensures normal delivery, but none of places gave me confidence to my expectations,,, Then Dr. Aparnaa recommended Rainbow hospital,,,, we visited and enquired about rainbow hospital and having strong belief in Dr. Aparnaa, we choose rainbow hospital....

3) Type and during delivery:  I strongly hope my child birth should occur normally, but having seeing pains of the mother ,couple of hours before delivery , i requested Dr. Aparnaa to take any decision to make the delivery as soon as possible, still she made it smooth NORMAL delivery....

Loads of thanks to Dr. Aparnaa Panda for all the support and guidance....",2019-12-20 15:40:37,False,True,Harish T,Many thanks for posting your story online. Congratulations on your wife's normal delivery.,2019-12-21T08:22:28+0000,Dr. Aparnaa Panda
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I still remember 01 of Sept when I did a pregnancy check test and realized that something unusual is happening with my body... I was happy and but equally worried that I never consulted any Doctor before conceiving. So, I decided to lookout for Doctors who can guide me. Needless to mention, “This was the first experience”

This is when I accidentally met “Dr. Aparna Panda” and, ""the ease at which she treated me and made me comfortable”, I think every women should have this accidental experience.

Throughout the whole pregnancy, she was always there to help and guide me… You name any technology and she was on “Top of it”. She just told me one thing during the initial stage “Vandana, if you not clear on anything, wtsapp me even if it is late.."". ***** ******** **** * **** ********* ** *** *********** *** * ********* ******** *** ******** **** *** ********** **** **********

I was during my 7 month diagnosed with gestational diabetes and had to undergo a lot of test but every time when the results came, I knew why these were required... Over a period of time, Thanks to Dr. Aparna, everything was under control.
She makes you feel very comfortable and explain everything in detail. 
On 18th April, I was worried and tensed when I got admitted but I was confident that I am in safe hands. The last thing that I remember is that I was happy entering and exiting OT of the hospital and the very next day, Dr.Aparna started pushing me to start walking. I was into pain but I know why she said this.. So thanks again!!  


Now below message is for ladies who feels their husbands are not ready for babies or don’t like visiting hospitals… 
Trust me ladies, Dr. Aparna has such a magic that your husband will start loving the whole experience of visiting and talking to Doctors… There have been times when he is directly discussing few things with Dr. Aparna and used to update me on the next steps….
Now, a lot of you might feel that it is natural – Trust me, It’s not!!! And even if it is, I would still give credit to Dr. Aparna as her nature itself makes everyone comfy.

So after writing on my entire experience, I would like to say “A BIG THANKYOU” to Dr. Aparna… If I have a healthy baby, it’s because of “YOU”. You came out of nowhere and offered me “A WORLD OF HAPPINESS”.
THANK YOU !!",2017-07-06 17:03:26,False,True,Vandana  Sharma,,,
None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Mine has been a tough pregnancy. Dr.Aparna Panda made it a beautiful experience. SHE IS THE BEST!!
I truly recommend her to anyone and suggest to just keep the trust on her. Dr.Aparna Panda will make sure mom and baby are safe in the time of pregnancy and are delivered safely. 

I first met her in January2013 when I was pregnant with my first baby. I was going through depression because of my father's death and was obese and 32 then, with constant panic attacks. She made me first comfortable and mentally prepared me to accept that I will be fine. She brought the confidence in me that I will be a happy mother and I delivered a beautiful boy in August 3013. 

2.5 years later I am again pregnant with my second baby and this time it's much more difficult and complicated. I had an emergency of a slippped miscarriage in the second month and I was actually thinking of not continuing my pregnancy as it's so threatening. To my amazement she made me believe confidently just within a week that I will be able to sail through very well and this time too I will deliver very safely a healthy baby. I also have high BP problems and get stressed very soon. Still Dr. Aparna Panda made sure everything is in control.

It's now my 7th month and I am eagerly waiting for my due date which is on 1st week of July. I am happy that I have Dr. Aparna Panda beside me and I know I have trusted the right person. 

I don't know the definition of a best doctor, but I know that Dr. Aparna Panda has been the best doctor who is a saviour to her patients. They are in safest hands and all they have to do is PUT COMPLETE TRUST IN HER. That's enough and the final experience any patient would have is ""THANK GOD, I WAS HANDLED BY DR. APARNA PANDA"". 

SHE HAS BEEN AND IS THE BEST. 

I wish her all the best in her career and life full of happiness as she is the cause so many smiles of so many contented and happy mother's.

A loyal &satisfied patient and a great well wisher!!

On my first visit I was anxious and bit worried as this was my first pregnancy but Dr. Aparnaa was kind enough to answer all my doubts. Thereafter I started visiting her regularly. My due date was in 1st week of March but my water broke on 28th January 2022. I was not sure whether really my water broke or was it something else. I visited Dr. Aparnaa for confirmation and she immediately told me to get admitted in Rainbow Hospital Bannerghatta. By the time I reached hospital I was in labour and pain increased as time passed by. Dr. Aparnaa came and visited me in Rainbow Hospital and told me that they won't be doing anything to stop or induce labour. Dr. Aparnaa was in constant touch with duty dr. Enquiring about my health condition. Since the pain became unbearable by 5.30 I went for epidural and I was told that I would be delivering between 8-10pm. After taking epidural at 6pm the pain reduced for an hour and again it started by 7pm. By this time Dr. Aparnaa had come to labour room and set everything for delivery. At 7.41 I delivered baby girl normally. Since my baby was about to be delivered way before it's due date I was scared whether I'll be able to deliver normally or have to understand c-section. But with Dr. Aparnaa's support and hospital staff's help I was able to deliver normally. I would any day recommend Dr. Aparnaa for normal delivery.

I came across Dr Aparnaa Panda, on my first visit to the doctor I felt she had a different approach compared to the others who I visited in the city. Her approach gave me the results I was seeking. Since then I have been consulting Dr Aparnaa Panda and it's been 3 Years from then. The reasons for visiting her each year was different. My recent visit was to confirm my pregnancy. Thereafter, throughout my pregnancy, from Day 1 she has been very cautious and ticked all basic checkpoints to make sure the baby is safe at every milestone until the delivery. She kept a close watch on my monthly follow ups and monitored regularly on my sugar and BP levels to make sure the baby is not at risk at any time. She doesn't take even 1% chance in a high risk situation. Even during my admission to the hospital, she and her staff followed up with me until I was hospitalized and took necessary steps to induce normally. With 16+ hours of inducing and with very little dilation. She took up a decision that's time sensitive and delivered our little bundle of joy in no time. Dr Aparnaa Panda is a very straightforward, hardworking, efficient and approachable doctor. You will get to know these traits when you visit her. And yes, she is strict when you don't follow up her instructions for your own good.
My experience with Dr Aparnaa Panda and her staff has been great! They have been nothing less than sincere, upfront and satisfactory at every level. Her approach and solutions towards the problems are very unique. She is a strict observer and follower of how your body responds and treats accordingly. She takes your inputs and feedbacks seriously at all times and answers all your questions. (It's best to get all your questions written on a notepad so that you don forget to ask her).

I felt like sharing mine coz this should help someone in determining the right decision. The 9 months of my pregnancy journey with Dr.Aparna has been extremely satisfying.

I had severe chest infection due to covid during my 35th week of pregnancy and had to be hospitalised in SOS. The way she had handled my case from helping me admitted in emergency to keeping me in priority without even thinking once that shifting me to another top hospital (who has better covid treatment facility than the maternity specialised hospital I was admitted in) in the city of Bengaluru during the last weeks of my pregnancy which ideally means is letting your patient go at the end moment, but she chose my health on top priority and advised us on the real time situation.

I visited Dr. Aparnaa when I was 4 months pregnant. She went through all old reports and explained everything. When I asked doctor if I can go for normal delivery, I was amazed to see how doctor encouraged us and 
gave us believe that she will definitely try for normal delivery first, C-section is 2nd option though I had gestational diabetes. 

As it was my first pregnancy, so me and my husband had lot of doubts. Aparnaa ma'am always answered all queries with lot of patience. She is so friendly in nature and same time she is strict on certain guidelines like; diet, regular walking which is actually good for pregnant mother and baby's health.

During covid lockdown, when many clinics are closed, Dr. Aparnaa never stopped looking after her patients. She always told me to keep in touch with her through Whatsapp.

I was nervous thinking how my delivery will be done during lockdown. But Doctor gave us relief and trust that she will be always there to take care of her patients whether it is lockdown or not. Even if pregnant mother becomes covid positive, she will never leave her patients. This is best thing you can hear from a doctor at this situation and I will be always grateful to Aparnaa Ma'am for that.

We wanted an initial scan and that too in the lockdown period.  Most of the well known Hospitals and Clinic (including the Doctor whom we visited before lockdown) refused to do a scan. We saw a review on google and visited Dr Aparnaa Clinic . She adhered to all the Corona Specific guidelines in her Clinic and that impressed us. She did the initial scan and has given minimal medicines to start . She explained about the diet importance and some daily exercises to be done and was too soft to my wife while explaining all. No unnecessary tests or medicines prescribed by her in the entire tenure. We faced another  setback during the 35 weeks of pregnancy when we (all family members) got infected to COVID-19. In this tensed situation we talked to  her even at  mid-night (without hesitation) . She suggested us some medicines and some precautionary measures to be taken.

After getting admitted to Rainbow on 5th Dec, she tried her best for the normal delivery. Thing got slightly complicated when the baby heart rate went too down and later baby has passed motions.

Yes I remember it was so difficult to keep our clinic open during the pandemic. Initial days of the lock down, I had to convince our staff to come to the clinic. They we so scared and the police used to harress them on the way. We had to keep our board light off and some other anxious patients in Ranka colony used to come and ask us every alternate day whether we were open or not. In that period, your wife had come to me in a very anxious state due to her previous bad experience and I am vey happy to provide the best of support during the pandemic. It was my duty to provide online support during unfortunate event of covid striking your family members.
We take great pride in being available during the lock down of the  pandemic and giving quality service while maintaining social distancing, ensuring all wear masks and use hand sanitisers at our clinic. Thank you so much for the understanding and cooperation that your family maintained. except for the patient, no other family member was allowed inside the chamber, which you understood as a ICMR protocol and had no complains against.

US doctor could never figure out the actual problem and kept giving me high dose of “Provera”. After 6-7 month of going through struggle and almost loosing my life due to so much of blood loss, I decided to take opinion from Doctor in India and that’s where I came in contact with “Dr Aparnaa Panda”. She looked at all my US medical reports, explained possible issues. She was worried about the treatment I was getting in US and recommended me to travel to India so that she can look into the problem/solution in right way. After 2 week of my virtual appointment with Dr Aparnaa, I came to India and met her in her clinic. She immediately took action and prescribed many tests to figure out the actual problem. She gave me few medication that I took for 4 days and my bleeding almost stopped. I had surgery done on 6th day by Dr Aparnaa after my bleeding was stopped and the whole process from start to end took 10 days. I am treated 200% for my problem in 10 days by Dr Aparnaa which US doctors could not even figure out in 7 months. She kept her check on me post surgery and gave advices for fast recovery over Whatsapp. I just can’t imagine what situation I would have been if I wouldn’t have contacted Dr Aparnaa. It’s been close to a month and I got my regular period which ended on time without any issues. ** ******* ** ** ************** humble and of motherly nature.

Hello All,This is my second review previous one is before delivery this is after delivery. i know how the reviews are important for individual to choose the doctor as i also gone through as every one and found awesom Dr Aparna Panda (we consulted only her). I will list my experiance.
1. Waiting time - MAXIMUM 15 mints on an average. Except in rare case that is bcz like us some one need her help,kindness,smile in labour ward.*** *** ********* **** ********* **** *** ********** Along with Yoga and Walking.
3. Need patients - she needs some time to study your body bcz all medicine will not suite all person its based on individual.my suggestion nothing will happen overnight be patient and have positive thoughts and believe her.
4. Choosing right hospital. We are very much comfortable with her so we took her suggestion to go with RAINBOW. Because she will take care of delivery because she studied my wife body for past 15 months(9months pregnancy + 6 months). As she knows her which treatments need to give, how to treat my wife also there is bond formed bw my Doctor and my wife.  in this case my wife was comfortable to express her feelings during labour pain.
5. Delivery - we expected NORMAL delivery. She gave full hope and support along with her team dr - sumitra nurse - subhasini,anita). More than that when delivery time is close by always you can reach to her dont worry about time. She is always ready to hear you even during labour pain. Only HUSBAND is allowed in labour ward so i am telling you.

I strongly recommend DR Aparna Panda for PREGANANCY from starting till you get beautiful baby in your hands.
Believe in HER she will take care all things.

THANKS A LOT mam for all and for our ANGEL.

"Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"I started visiting Dr. Aparna from 3rd Month of my wife's pregnancy and from that time till the day I was blessed with a boy she has taken care of all what was needed. I must tell she is extremely well aware and professional on every front, a bit strict but certainly needed.
There was a time in around 6month, when we got really tensed( since we did our non medico reading on internet) after a scan which showed cervix length to be short, but Dr. Aparna made us really confortable and kept things under control by just medication rather than complex procedures to prevent pre-term.
Post 38 weeks, we went for a routine checkup along final growth scan,when she suggested to get admitted since water level was fluctuating, she did multiple checkup with some interval to come to this conclusion. She was certain and explained us about all the possible scenario's, so that we can make our mind well before rather that wasting time to decide during labour.
It was induced labour,so that normal delivery can be attempted.With god's grace my wife's body responded well due to timely decision and effort from Dr.Aparna along with all the staff of the hospital. The wife as well as baby are healthy and fine, and were discharged the next day after all the neccessary checkups and test.
All in all it was a wonderful experience with Dr. Aparna Panda.

I am really thankfull to Dr. Aparna for all the effort and guidance.My wife always wanted normal delivery and she made sure to do all possible to fullfill that.

I went immediately to the hospital and got it checked and aparna followed up over phone and ensured that there s no water leak and i  am perfectly fine and then went home.Such is her attitude towards patients.
Unexpectedly mine was a sudden c section because i started getting contractions ,but baby head was nit fixed, so aparna suggested to wait for few more hours for the head to fix,but it did not and she suggested its better to go for c section ,because baby head fixing was uncertain and also i had already gine through mild labour contractions for more than 24 hours, she promptly came on time and conducted the c section and delivered a beautiful healthy baby boy on dec 10th.

She has been always accessible and responds to all our queries in Whatsapp or in person. She also has a personal touch when she deals with her patients and knows most of their case personally. This is so reassuring when it comes to the Big Day of Delivery.

Since we lived in Electronic City, we could meet her at the Anjana Polyclinic  for the regular checkups which was quite convenient for us and for the delivery, she referred us to Rainbow Hospital.

She is exceptional and has taken care of like a gem.I can't express enough gratitude for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Aparnaa throughout the pregnancy journey and the challenging NVD. From the very first prenatal visit to the delivery room, Dr. Aparnaa demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to ensuring both mine and my baby's well-being.Dr. Aparnaa'a attentiveness and dedication were evident from the beginning. Regular prenatal check-ups were thorough, and any concerns or questions were met with patience and clear explanations. The doctor's calm and reassuring demeanor helped alleviate anxieties that often accompany pregnancy. No unwanted medicines were prescribed, a healthy diet was suggested by the doctor and I was able to keep the vitals under control along with body weight.What truly set apart was the prompt response during the crucial moments of the delivery. As I got the labour pain, we reached the hospital and informed the doctor, the doctor's ability to reach the hospital in no time, very early in the morning, played a crucial role in ensuring a safe and successful delivery.Throughout the labor process, Dr. Aparnaa maintained a perfect balance of professionalism and empathy. Clear communication and genuine concern for both me and my baby's well-being were evident at every step. The doctor's expertise was evident, and the calm presence provided much-needed reassurance during a crucial situation by which I was able to give birth naturally to a healthy baby boy.The postpartum care was equally exceptional.  Doctor continued to monitor both my recovery and the baby's health, ensuring a smooth transition into motherhood. The consistent follow-up appointments further highlighted the doctor's commitment to their patients' long-term well-being.Dr. Aparnaa is not just a skilled medical professional but a genuine lifesaver.

I got to know about her from google reviews and started consulting her from the very first day of suspect of my pregnancy. She is a very professional doctor, neither used any sugar-coated words nor prescribed any unnecessary medication. This has been our 1st pregnancy and being totally unexperienced, she guide us like a friend and supported us with prompt response through whatapp on any minute health related issues. Since I am bit obese with a family history of hypertension, she suggested me to stick to a very controlled diet and following her instruction the entire 9 months had been the most amazing and easy-going experience one can ever think off. I gained very minimal weight during this time and thanks to God, did not suffer from any added complications of gestational diabetics or high blood pressure. Following her guidelines, I must happily admit that I was able to fit into my regular dresses even on the 9th month of pregnancy. Not only about looks, I was able to carry on with my regular chores and office works without any discomfort till the last moment of pregnancy, until the water broke. This happened just the next day of visiting her on my 37th weeks and she too warned me to be prepared as she observed that I have already started to dilate. Although I got admitted to Rainbow hospital just after the water broke, I was not getting pain and she suggested to medically induce labor. Even then the labor processed very slowly and I was hardly getting any contractions. A heartfelt thanks to doctor and the support staff in the hospital as they have been extremely patient and waited for 19 hours to let it happen naturally. Interestingly, towards midnight I felt light contraction and was put on epidural, which soothed my pain. Right after that, again thanking God here, as my baby too held long along with me and that dilation started to progress naturally. Early in the next morning I was fully dilated and doctor proceeded with normal vaginal delivery. Thanks to all the supporting doctors and nurses in the labor room as I couldn't have done it without their push. Within 30-40 mins Aparna maam handed me my bundle of joy and it was such a wonderful feeling to see the body I was nurturing within my body. I would give all credit to her for such a smooth and satisfactory experience of the otherwise know extremely painful process and helping me delivery a healthy boy and support my post process recovery as well.
Finally, me and my husband are very glad and count ourselves fortunate to have consulted Aparna maam and her supportive team of radiologist, nurses, consultants and receptionist for their prompt and adequate response in time of need. I will always recommend my friends, family and acquaintances to consult her for any Gynae-related problems.

Dr.Aparna agreed to all of it and I was totally satisfied when she mentioned that she practices all of it.

The best part was, I went through lot of pregency related complications, with Aparna mam's help, suggestions and guidence I conceived and delivered a baby boy and all the credit goes to mam and her approach.

My relationship with Dr Aparna mam began way back in 2019 when I consulted her for pregnancy related issues. She looked at all my previous reports and prescribed necessary tests to figure out  the actual problem and explained possible issues and solution. Her approach and solution towards the problems are very unique. Throughout my pregency she has been very cautious to make sure the baby is safe at every milestone until the delivery. During my journey, I found her very straightforward and approachable , I could contact her anytime whenever needed. I can't thank her enough for her care,promptness and honesty.

Though Dr had suggested us for normal delivery but went through C section due to some emergency. My C section experience was also satisfactory since Dr had done exceptional job and I had started walking on the first day itself. My stitches are also healed within 2 weeks.

We have been consulting with Dr Aparna from last 10 months and she is very friendly, approachable, responsive and helpful. Our main concern was to deliver baby through NVD, in Bangalore we heard most doctors are suggesting C-Section (in my Society 9 out of 11 are C-sections), but after meeting Dr. Aparna we realize NVD is possible and she took 100% guarantee for it and my wife delivered baby through NVD. she had never prescribed any unnecessary scan or medicine also, during labor pain my wife gave up and decided to take Epidural analgsia (which reduce labor pain, cost is Approx. 12 to 14K INR), but Aparna mem had convinced her and brought back her confidence. She is always responding over phone without any time constraint. During labor pain she responded our whats up message early morning 05:00 AM and helped us and given instruction until ambulance arrived. Aparna mem had kept us positive until my wife delivered baby through NVD.
before delivery we were in tension how we are going to handle everything alone but she helped us in each and every aspect. In Rainbow hospital also, she used visit us twice in day and spent few minutes with and guided with right Approaches to get well soon and also inquired Medical staff with Dose and way of taking medicine every time.

My wife had vomited twice during a day and after vomiting she felt something is stuck in her throat. We immediately went to Rainbow but the duty doctor after consultation with our regular doctor told to visit any ENT. This was really a bad experience and then luckily we saw Dr. Aparna Panda's clinic just opposite to our apartment and we visited her for the first time. She said that its very normal in pregnancy and she told its because of acid reflux. She gave medicine and my wife was fine in a span of few hours. Later during our entire treatment she guided us properly. At the end of due date since my wife didn't get the pain she told us to go for induced pain and then at the end of an eventful night on 14th May early morning we had a normal delivery. This became possible only because of encouragement of doctor and strong belief that normal delivery is possible although heart beat of baby was dipping sometimes.

The medication and flowup they did was so good . Doctor responded to all our query during the consultation and if there any medical emergency doctor was available over the phone anytime ..

After conceiving  we were hoping for the normal delivery and also the track record of normal delivery by Aparna doctor was very good .. 

During the pregency period she took good care by doing regular scanning/blood test  and provided medications based in the reports .

At the 8th month due to food infection ( Outside junk food) we had severe 
vomitting and doctor suggested for three bottles of drips after which vomitting got reduced.
And during the 9 month after general scanning doctor the stomach of baby was little big .. By doubting it doctor suggested for blood test and in which sugar levels was bit high for normal delivery was quite difficult at that time . 

In the next day had a severe pains and got admitted to Rainbow hospital it was almost night 10:30 duty doctor did a NST and shared the reports to doctor Aparna , the pulse rate of the baby was less than 100 which was difficult for normal delivery and we had a call with Aparna doctor and agreed to keep in observation for some more time there was a severe pain and doctor suggested for Epidural injection for painless delivery and was in a continues observation .
It was around 7:30 i think doctor Aparna came for the check and did internal checkup as she observed bleeding and started with the delivery procedures and final it was like a film climax everything was too fast and it was a baby boy with Normal delivery .

On 9th Oct 2017 my wife noticed the spotting as this is normal in some cases we just ignored it and tried to get in touch with Dr. Aparna Panda but couldn't get in touch with her as she was busy, then we consulted our doctor in our home town she helped us out and we didn't visit the clinic of Dr. Panda as my wife didn't want to take the risk of travelling as she was afraid of bleeding more.  When my wife noticed blood spot again on 11th Oct 2017 in the morning she decided to visit Dr. Panda and when she did the scanning Dr. Panda came to the conclusion that the heartbeat of the baby has stopped. This is the same doctor who said everything is fine on 8th Oct 2017. She asked us get admitted in Rainbow Hospital and gave us a list of lab tests and asked us to give the samples at her clinic as it is cost effective as compared to Rainbow Hospital charges. She asked us to get admitted by between 2pm-4pm as we needed time to make arrangements for our elder kid. We have the insurance and to be on a safer side we wanted to know what would be an approximate cost for the abortion, Dr. Panda said that it would be around 40,000 to 50,000. When we were preparing to go to Dr. Panda's clinic my wife started bleeding heavily and we tried to get in touch with the doctor she didn't show any concern and asked to visit Rainbow Hospital directly.

Anyways my wife is doing fine and we have no complains against anyone. ",2017-10-26 17:01:39,False,False,Verified Patient,"I think the summary of your story is that I have been unfriendly with you and your wife? 
I had explained to you that your wife might start bleeding at anytime and to please get her admitted immediately. But you refused because the cost of hospitalisation was 22,000 without blood tests, medicines and consumables and 32,000 including the previously mentioned charges. Please remember that you are talking about a standard and reputed hospital whose charges are fixed and can be clarified at anytime by the billing section whose phone no I had  provided to you  at 11am of 11th Oct 2017, when you had come to my clinic. The cost is not 40,000 to 50,000 as what you have mentioned.
For you, her condition was not important, and you wanted to do the procedure in your hometown.  Also, you  took away from my clinic, a very important paper, which I need to submit to the DHO, instead of handing it over to my receptionist.
I requested you to atleast do all her  baseline blood test done asap so that if she comes as an emergency, providing her the lifesaving procedures will be faster.  
At around 5 pm , you called me up and said the she was bleeding and you yourself asked me whether you should come to the clinic or the hospital with your wife.
It is then that I asked you , how is her condition and how much is the bleeding? 
When you said that the bleeding is more I asked you a few other questions and found out that her condition must be stable, so I said that you can come to hospital so that  immediate lifesaving procedure like starting an IV line can be started. This was at 5pm.
Again I called you up at 6 30pm and then again at 7 45 pm  because you reached neither the clinic, nor the hospital till then and kept on saying that you were on the way.
At 8pm, U called me yourself and told me , "" Dr Aparnaa, it is done, we have admitted ***********( your wife's name).""
I was surprised and I asked how did you get admitted so soon, because just 15 min back, you said you were still on the way.
That is when you said that you had got admitted in another hospital which I am also attached to. It is then that I asked you to tell me clearly name of the hospital that you were admitted in.
Please remember that I had called you up again and again and asked why you have not reached and how your wife was doing despite me being busy with my patients in my OPD.
After you mention that you have got admitted under some other doctor, it is unethical on  my part to interfere in her treatment.
It is then that I requested you to return the important document back into my clinic.
Anybody who reads this can conclude that while you kept on making me wait for you to come on a rainy day, you were actually bargaining for a reduced rate in a nearby hospital which does not have ICU facilities to take care of your wife as compared to the cost effective hospital which I had suggested you. 
Also to set the records straight, however busy I am, I am always available on phone for all emergencies and in whatsapp to clear all doubts.
I dont know what you want to achieve by misinterpreting and omitting many important events in your story.",2017-10-31T06:05:24+0000,Dr. Aparnaa Panda
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"First of all, thanks a lot ma'am for making our family complete and sorry for posting review so late.
I have been consulting Aparnaa ma'am for last 2 years since i was diagnosed with hypothyroid and minor prolactinoma. But despite all these complications, I conceived naturally just because of her guidance. When we decided to have a baby, our primary concern was to deliver a baby through NVD. From 1st month of pregnancy until delivery, Aparnaa ma'am guided us throughout each stage. She always welcomed us with a bright smile, which made us feel positive and confident and listened to all our small queries, which we came across. I simply followed her invaluable medical advice and as a result, i had a smooth and healthy pregnancy. She always insisted on eating healthy food rather than taking unwanted medications. Moreover, she always responded to queries whenever needed no matter what the time it is, which is truly appreciated. Under her able guidance, i had a normal delivery. We blessed with a baby boy on 23rd May.
On 22nd May, i visited ma'am for my last pregnancy checkup and that day ma'am told us that my amniotic fluid level wasn't sufficient and so the delivery cannot be delayed. We went for RT PCR test immediately since i was told to get admitted to the hospital the moment i received my covid report. But my baby had his own plans. My labor pain started on 22nd May around 1pm after i returned to my home. I reached at the hospital at 6:30pm. The pain got intense around 7pm. Around 12:30am,I was only 7cm dilated. Despite my insufficient amniotic fluid level and excessive bleeding, Aparnaa ma'am tried her best to deliver my baby normally. But my cervix wasn't ready to be dilated more. At last, ma'am Decided to go for C-Section. I was shifted to OT. Ma'am checked my cervix for the last time. And surprisingly, i was fully dilated by then. Ma'am was so happy and she decided to go for vacuum delivery. At last, my baby was delivered through NVD thanks to ma'am. I would like to say thanks to the team of Rainbow Hospital who took care of me and my baby very well.
In a nutshell, her calm demeanor, expertise, and experience make her patients feel assured that they are in the safest hands. We are happy and satisfied to have Aparnaa ma'am in our lives because of which my pregnancy ended on a happy note.

I would strongly recommend Dr. Aparna for Normal delivery and she is a masterpiece in Gynaecology and obstetrics. She is one of the most inspiring and admirable doctor i have ever seen.

In the seventh month we have visited Dr. Aparna madam (at care diagnostics)and she encouraged,  motivated & given enough confidence for normal delivery. After consulting her, there was no fear of C-Section. She has great commitment and patience.

I am extremely thankful to Dr. Aparna madam for taking right decisions at the right time during labor (40 hours of labor). Day and Night she was available for us  over phone calls, whatsapp and visited when required. No doctor would have waited for such long time in hospital.

After getting intense contractions we went to  Rainbow Hospital at night 1:30 A.m (27th march). and Aparna madam suggested to stay in observation room.
NST test was performed continuously to monitor baby health , even in the Midnight  3 am madam answered calls and given suggestions.

After 36 hours of labor, cervix was only 2 cm dilated.   very  less progress in dilation. Duty doctor suggested to go for C-section. We lost hope for normal delivery and in complete disappointment. Dr. Aparna was continuously monitoring , over phone calls with Nurse and duty doctor entire night from 11:30 pm to morning 7 :30 Am.

Suddenly Dr. Aparna came to hospital in the morning time and taken right decision & changed medications which helped for the dilation of cervix from 2cms to 10 cms & delivered baby successfully on March 28th.

Extremely happy with facilities provided by Rainbow hospital(Bannergatta road) & providing best infrastructure.

I consulted ma'am and she made us understand the cause in a single consultation and guided us on how to prepare for getting pregnant. 
Actually I was diagnosed with LUPUS (SLE) which I got to know after consulting ma'am and she gave me hope and positive energy to conceive naturally without any medicine. With god's grace I got pregnant in a month . Whole pregnancy ma'am gave me proper guidance and ma'am gave positive vibes in each follow up which gave me the positive result. I delivered a baby girl last month. Before consulting ma'am I was not sure whether I will become a mom. I will be grateful for you ma'am you made high risk pregnancy into a smooth journey thanks a lot 🙏 ma'am

I expected that it would be discarded to my horror the nurse asked me to lie down on the same.After the tests I was informed doctor has gone on a leave and I should come the next week.So again I had to come back and pay a good amount just to get the reports shown.Third Day- Doctor did not bother to have a look at the reports, ****** said take some medicines we will help you concieve. I expected an explanation but I got a cold reply. Anyways not bothered. Did not visit her again. P.S I am not here  to malign anybody's image. I don't need my money back. ***** Neither am I unhappy with my life or weight, height etc etc . So don't want to hear this stuff too cliched and rude. At least create hygienic conditions for the patients, they are paying a good amount and deserve it.",2019-05-16 13:17:01,False,False,Verified Patient,"I have taken your feedback very seriously and have warned the diagnostic center I go to for two hours five days in a weeks, twelve kilometers away from my house, to be more patient friendly. 
Also, I have spoken to you telephonically two weeks back and told you that I am not the owner of the diagnostic center and you have apologized to me for misrepresenting the facts online and have promised to edit your feedback accordingly but have not. 
Firstly, I can’t understand why you had to endure the horrible experience when you could have pointed out the unhygienic condition to the radiologist who owns the place during your ultrasound and that doctor would have taken necessary steps so that you would not have to suffer all the trouble.
#2. It is human for doctors to take leave and if you had clarified with the receptionist, she would not have charged you for the follow-up visit to show the reports after 10 days since I was on leave for a week.
#3. You visited me because  you were anxious to conceive and not because you wanted a pregnancy consultation.
#4. You had come late for your appointment and I had a delivery patient waiting for me twelve kilometers away from the diagnostic center I met you. I was displeased with the receptionist for collecting your consulation fees. What should I have done? Returned the fees back to you, not considering the fact that you had come spending your time and energy to pay a visit to me? 
#5. I did see your reports in detail and still you have written that I did not bother to see your reports. I saw that your thyroid was under-corrected and gave you proper medication and diet to correct the same and do a repeat check after 6 weeks which you did not. This you have yourself admitted in the telephonic conversation you had with me two weeks back.
#6. Your blood reports also showed low fertility values for which I gave you adequate diet, exercise tips and medications. I did not want you to feel low about it and hence did not go into the details of it. Is that what you mean by a cold reply? In that case I promise to myself that next time onward I will not hesitate to call a spade a spade and definitely be more specific. I accept this is a unpardonable mistake from my side.
PS. I cannot understand why you have written a long anonymous review misrepresenting the facts six months after the incident happened. But I would like to say one thing. We are all humans and small mistakes can happen by everyone. By me, the radiologist, the receptionist, the nurse and even by you. Love and understanding for fellow humans and effective communication can make this world a better place to live in.
Peace be with you.",2019-05-26T07:34:25+0000,Dr. Aparnaa Panda
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Gynae Problems,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Aparna is one of those gynac who I would blindly recommend to anyone in B'lore.
I visited her post 9 mths of my wedding , when we were ready to get into a family  planning. On consulting, she told me that I had issue (PCOD) and this may not make me conceive without treatment, but she also explained why PCO's is not a big issue these days as it's very common for every 3rd lady, due to lifestyle, food habits etc. she guided me through what lifestyle I must follow to make things easy + suggested some medicines and test and a small diagnostic surgery, to regularize my  period.  
Most importantly, since she treats you in her own clinic, she takes personal interest in your concerns and address them, unlike doctors in Big hospitals who may not be able to give you a personal attention all throughout. she has lovely staff, who make you feel belonged as well.
Since she was new to me, i was also checking on my treatment with my aunt, who is a gyno (not in B'lore) as well, and i learn the treatment is exactly same what she would have done had she treated me. 
i have conceived and both me and bby is doing great by far. i would blindly recommend Dr. Aparna for any gynac issues with any Lady. you can just trust her, coz she scolds you like a Mom, guides you like a friend and treats you like a professional. :) :) Thanks Dr. Aparna for all the care you have taken till date !",2019-04-25 05:10:35,False,True,Verified Patient,Many thanks for your kind words.,2019-04-25T08:04:26+0000,Dr. Aparnaa Panda

She spends more time with patients and clear every doubts that is being asked.
Initially we felt that she is not spending enough time and not talking too much. But as the day progresses, she became so friendly and was explaining everything very nicely.

Though it's not recommended but we used to ask questions in Whatsapp as well. And she was responding in Whatsapp and was clearing our doubts. Sometimes even at nights my wife felt something unusual and we were having no clue whether it is normal or alarming. We used to do Whatsapp and by morning we were getting the reply from Dr. Panda.

Clinic is very clean and hygienic. Staffs are very good and polite.

She gave us choice to decide and do the delivery any hospital of our choice.
We decided to do the delivery in Rainbow hospital and Dr. Aparna Panda did the delivery in Rainbow Hospital.

She was recommending for Normal delivery. But we couldn't wait and decided for CS. We are so happy that she cares so much about patients. She was suggesting to go with the natural process.

At the time of delivery, she came and had a chat with my parents about the conditions in details. My parents are also very happy.

At the end we became a complete family and thanks to Dr. Aparna Panda for all her help and support.

"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"A doctor who knows where she is heading to and build the current foundation accordingly. We went to Doctor few months before my wife conceived and wanted proper guidance and medication. Its been 10-11 months of best of guidance, a happy wife and a sweet little princess. Dr. Aparnaa has played a role of Dietician, Pediatrician and finally a Gynaecologist all the way.

NOTE: She may scold you at times if you go off track, but that's what parents are supposed to do. 

Regarding Amenities: The clinic is right in front of Rainbow Hospital and since we were using Rainbow for our scans it was a perfect pairing. Wait time is never beyond 15-20min. 

Regarding Expectation Setting: Doctor is logical here and doesn't over doze you with medicines and scan schedules. The one thing I liked about the doctor was that in 7th month itself she told us that its going to be a C section delivery and not a normal one. This helped me in plan better (not only financials but call relatives accordingly). 

The last visit: Most of the doctors do set grounds for the next delivery on the last consultation day, but what doctor did was to give a diet chart and some advise on exercise and stay healthy.

Overall Rating: if given a chance to rate the doctor: 5/5.
Amenity: 4.5/5 (too much traffic to tackle)
Reliability: 5/5

I am very surprised to see your comments.  Each and every patient who  comes to me for early pregnancy checkup is given folic acid tablets and told specifically that it is for baby brain development.
I firmly tell all my first trimester patients not to eat papaya and pineapple and not to travel in first four months of  pregnancy. Exact reason for the same is also explained to the patient. 
Only after that i advise them for a early pregnancy scan to check for viability and location of pregnancy.
In your case,  ur first visit was on the 30th of June and only after u were convinced with my first consultation, u did ur early pregnancy  scan in a nearby diagnostic center and then again met me on the 3rd with ur early pregnacy scan report.  U were 6 weeks 3 days by dates and also 6 weeks by scan.  It was a viable pregnacy with no subchorionic haemorrhage and hence I said that it was a normal scan report. 
U must have read well online and since the answers to ur questions were yes, i answered yes. I have spent adequate time with u in both ur visits to my clinic. 
I am also in regular touch with my patients over whatsapp and their remaining doubts are answered.

I am extremely sorry to know that u had an unpleasant experience.
I am sure there is some misunderstanding her. Because I take a long time to review my patients past records. How is it possible that in ur records, there has been a miscarriage and I say that there hasn't been? 
For a miscarriage to have occurred, there should be a simple urine pregnancy positive report or a positive BHCG report or an ultrasound report saying that u were pregnant. 
If u have just missed ur periods but preg test is negative, then it might be just a case of irregular cycles. 
If at all I have told you that you were not pregnant and it was due to abnormal hormones that u have not got your cycles, I must have given you my true opinion on your condition. 
How can you judge me based on what you think is right? Please don't judge me based on what you think is right. Rather you should judge me on my honest opinion based on my experience.

Bad experience ,2019-08-30 07:39:18,False,False,Verified Patient,"Despite loosing an important family member of my household to death, I had been visiting electronic City which is 15kms from my house alternate days so that patients who need me don't suffer. I never took leave for 4to 5 days at a stretch and I can show u my calendar data at any time. 
I had already explained to u that and told you to Whatsapp me the report which you did and I advised you what to do too. 
Instead of thanks, you come after 12 days with a new problem(your old problem was cured) and expect to be seen free of cost. 
I am still ready to do charity, but do you expect the diagnostic center where I work to run at a loss?
I regret seeing thankless patients like you and don't recommend any doctor to see a patient with such cheap mentality as yours.
The receptionists never give false reasurrances like this. Our follow up guidelines are clearly demonstrated at the reception and also in the registration form which you have duly signed.
And you are not a young adolescent, you are a working lady so please no sympathies for young ladies like you.

Want to bring out some facts here. You had come to me first on 25th Oct 2016 and then continued to come for a few visits to solve  your problem not to mention the countless free consultations I gave you on whatsapp.

She asked me if she can travel and when I replied her in the negative, I had to give her a detailed 2 pages typed NOT HANWRITTED explaination of why she should not.
On a busy Saturday afternoon OPD when she asked me the same question along with her husband, I requested her not to ask the same question again and again.
Since you had chaproned her and were waiting outside she went like a 35 year old baby crying up to you for your comfort.
