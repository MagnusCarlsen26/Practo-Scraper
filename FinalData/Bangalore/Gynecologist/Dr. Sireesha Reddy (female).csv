"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"It is bit too late to write my experience with Dr. Sireesha Reddy as now my daughter is 3 years 3 months but its better to be late than never.
Initially I was consulting couple of other gynecologists but felt that the personal touch was missing. Then one day I consulted Dr. Sireesha @ Columbia Asia Hebbal. *** ** **** ** ***** ** *** 

Her pleasant personality and the rejuvenating smile took away half of my nervousness. She is very humble and gives attention to each and every small things about your health. During my 6th month of pregnancy, I developed Gestational Diabetes. I was very scared that this might affect the baby as well but she handled it with so much of personal care that I sailed it through smoothly. 

My sugar level was very high hence I had to attach a insulin cartridge device to my body which helped me to balance continuous & flow of insulin in my body. As per her guidance I had to keep noting down each and every reading of sugar level for 3 times a day.It was very complicated but she gave me so much confidence that it looked all easy & simple to me.

Finally the day came when I got admitted. Due to my Diabetes Dr. had to induce Labor. Everything was going smooth, I was going through the labor pain for almost 3 hours then in the midnight around 3:45 they had noticed that the heart beat of the baby was going down. From 140 heart beat per minute it came down to 60. This was scary as it could have costed the life of the little one. After this everything happened as speed of light.The nurse informed the Dr. and with in no time she was standing in front of me. That time my water bag was also not broken. They had to break it manually and immediately took me to the Operation theater and by early morning around 4:20 the baby was out. 

I was amazed to see the speed and action to execute things so fast by Dr. Sireesha. Through out my pregnancy, she has been standing beside me like my guardian ****** I have got lot of gratitude towards her.
I strongly recommend her. In spite of so many complications in my pregnancy I delivered a very healthy baby. It was all possible because of Dr. Sireesha.

During my labor in the last few minutes I was never confident of delivering the baby ""normal"" , I was feeling really tired and felt it's not possible as the entire labour and pain took for 15 hours long 
, due to which my  entire energy got drained and I had no energy to push the baby out but the minute Dr Sireesha Reddy arrived , the confidence she gave me at that moment really helped in pushing and the baby was finally ""out"", I was actually suprised at myself that I  could finally do it.I can't thank her enough for motivating me to do it.
