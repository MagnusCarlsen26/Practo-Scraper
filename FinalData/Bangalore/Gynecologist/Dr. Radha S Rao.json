I have been referring her to my friends and family personally, finally thought of sharing a review publicly.\nMy wife went through an early pregnancy event way back in 2018 that' when we met the doctor for the first time. She was very accurate in diagnosing the situation and responded very quickly during an emergency.\nShe has helped us through the pregnancy of our two kids until now.\nDoctor supported and encouraged my wife to go for normal delivery both times and provided the confidence that once we reach the hospital she would make sure the best possible course of action would be taken from then on. For example, during both labours she was monitoring the situation through the night at a regular interval.\nShe is crystal clear in her communication and she has been very transparent in disclosing the details. Her diagnosis/assessment is spot on.\nThe experience in the clinic were mixed in the beginning ( until first few visits) but then it has been smooth with booking of an appointment or in clinic waiting etc.",

Doctor was very kind, simple and a very calm who answers all my questions patently and gives advice appropriately. Consultation charge was below normal compare to other clinics and in my opinion she doesn't prescribe any unnecessary medication or scans through out my Pregnancy. She also asked us to share reports via emails so that she can advise on mail, thus saving time for both of us. \n\nThough I use to travel almost 10KM and wait up to 2 hours to see doctor , I fell which is really worthy waiting. Staff behaviour and clinic ambiance are average compared to other big hospitals in Bangalore. \n\nFor delivery she suggested Cloud9 Jayanagar . It was a normal delivery and I delivered a baby boy. During good whole 10 hours of labour she and her team at cloud9 took care of me very well and now we both are doing fine. Now I need to find equally good paediatrician to show my son:-). Overall you can blindly trust her and follow what she advises without thinking twice, trust me you are in the right hands. Surely I recommend her to my friends and relatives.",

And that's when we decided on Dr. Radha purely based on her reviews at Practo. We used to visit her at Janani clinic. Over the course of time she moved to Apollo Cradle, however, since we were very much confident about her that it didn't bother us.Dr. Radha is very good and experienced in what she does and during the whole pregnancy, we never felt even for once that we have taken wrong decision. She always make sure that her patients get all their queries resolved no matter if you are asking even silly ones. She is very calm and explain the things in detail. My husband always had his own set of questions during every visit and she never failed to answer those. We clearly expressed our wish for going through natural delivery to her and she was always supportive of that - by the way it was natural in the end :) . In conclusion, I definitely recommend Dr. Radha to everyone. Only advise is that you have to be patient as waiting time during appointments is little high. ",

However the time she spends is too less, not much importance given to history and no possibility to consider alternate therapy before prescribing hormonal therapy etc.,\n\nShe did a wonderful job with ovarian cyst removal for my wife but then prescribed a hormonal injection which she said would help stop periods and help with menopause. She did not spend time explaining the side effects or possibly long term effects of this. I feel she should have done this and that would have helped us take an informed decision. My wife is now suffering many side effects of these two injections taken and the periods did not stop (restarted after few months), they have become more painful etc.,  We will never go back again there for any treatment.\n\nIt would have been better if she had spent more time explaining what these injections are for, would they really help, what are the possible side effects, is there really a benefit from these v/s some other methods or not doing anything etc., But now we cannot reverse what has been done, sadly. So have to live with that. This is our story.",

                "review_text": "We went to Dr. Radha after taking treatment from another doctor in one of the leading women's hospital on Sarjapura road. We visited the doctor there for close to a year.  We were having problem in conceiving the child. After many months of trying, the other doctor gave up and asked us to visit fertility clinic in Kormangala. We did visit the fertility clinic and they advised advanced techniques IVF without actually confirming whether there is really a problem or not. After this point, somebody gave us the contact of Dr. Radha Rao. \nIn the first visit itself Dr. Radha said (I remember very clearly)  we will have go through 6 complete cycles before we jump to any conclusion. Also she said we will have to keep track of things with regular medical tests to understand what is happening. She was very much in control of the situation and confident of her skill from the very start. This tracking helped because in the first very  cycle the problem was found and rectified. We completed the whole 9 month time period under her guidance and found her way of working very good. She never created fear or urgency to get any extra medical tests done. On the contrary she told us the need of medical tests and the importance to our particular case. There is a test during the second trimester that cost 40,000/- Rupee and is applicable only to couples where the lady's age is above 34-35 years. She did categorically told us that it is applicable to situations where lady is of higher age and is not necessary in our case. Similar she gave the correct opinion on stem cell banking as well. \nOverall I would recommend Dr. Radha to every body. We stay good 15 km away from Jaya Nagar and the visits to the doctor took full one working day (She does not practice on weekend)  because of traffic and tiredness of travel. But in the end it was all worth it. A good and ethical doctor is very difficult to find and bad ones can do great harm mentally and physically.  And there is a very wide disparity in the skill and experience of various doctors practicing out there. Choose wisely! ",

Doctor is very kind . she treats her patient very well and she interact a lot with her patient and try to find out the correct reason of the the illness.I have visited her in JP nagar Locality. staff behavior and clinic ambiance was also good.\n\nFriendly, efficient front desk staff. Courteous medical staff. Appointment making (and canceling) is a simple process. On line system easy to navigate. Dr Radha is the best! If you are like me you dread going to your annual check up But going to Dr Radha makes it like a interactive session ask what ever you wnat to ask about your health issue . She is caring, gentle, and fast! She makes you feel totally comfortable and is there to listen to you. I am so thankful I switched doctors and found Dr Radha I've never had a bad experience here. Every doctor and nurse I have visited has been extremely helpful, kind, and understanding. The receptionists are wonderful too. I highly recommend them for any and all medical needs.\n\nI really liked Dr Radha - I felt very comfortable with her while under her care.\n",

But that time due to some reason i could not able to continue my treatment so again few days back i have visited to her . I booked my appointment with Practo.I am satisfied with the doctor . I am still following  up the doctor. Now my next appointment is after two months.\n\nDoctor is very patient  she tried to check out the other related problem also and finally conclude the major reason of the problem. I  usually visit to her with appointment when ever i reached in the clinic on the the time of appointment they will attend me on the same time but i fail to attend the appointment then also they try to reschedule my appointment so in that situation only ten to fifteen minutes here and there. Overall they are managing the clinic very efficiently. Trying to avoid the waiting time as much as they can .\n\nI visited her in JP nagar clinic basic facilities are available there in the clinic staff is also professional and helpful . I would definitely like to recommend her.\n\nDr Radha is so great. Super welcoming and informed. Their nurses are so great. Very happy with the entire facility and experiences.",

Her recommendations were practical and she explained the rationale behind everything she prescribed. She allayed our fears and was available on whatsapp to answer our queries. Her bedside manner during delivery was great and that definitely helped calm me and enabled me to deliver my son at full term through normal delivery without an epidural. Overall, I had a positive pregnancy experience and a big part of it was due to Dr.Radha Rao.",

Ma'am assured my complete safety during delivery and encouraged me for a normal delivery. She has a well equipped clinic, so I didnot hav to run around anywhere for my scans and tests during pregnancy. After 2 years of child birth I developed a vaginal infection along with irregular periods for 5 months. With minimal medication prescribed by the Dr within a weeks time i'm feeling almost back to normal. The best qualities I like about madam is she is patient in listening to our problems, very quick and precise in examining the problems of patients and prescribes minimal medicines. *** ** *** ** *** **** ************** ",

She was very accurate in diagnosing the situation and responded very quickly during an emergency.\nShe has helped us through the pregnancy of our two kids until now.\nDoctor supported and encouraged my wife to go for normal delivery both times and provided the confidence that once we reach the hospital she would make sure the best possible course of action would be taken from then on. For example, during both labours she was monitoring the situation through the night at a regular interval.\nShe is crystal clear in her communication and she has been very transparent in disclosing the details. Her diagnosis/assessment is spot on.\nThe experience in the clinic were mixed in the beginning ( until first few visits) but then it has been smooth with booking of an appointment or in clinic waiting etc.",

Doctor was very kind, simple and a very calm who answers all my questions patently and gives advice appropriately. Consultation charge was below normal compare to other clinics and in my opinion she doesn't prescribe any unnecessary medication or scans through out my Pregnancy. She also asked us to share reports via emails so that she can advise on mail, thus saving time for both of us. \n\nThough I use to travel almost 10KM and wait up to 2 hours to see doctor , I fell which is really worthy waiting. Staff behaviour and clinic ambiance are average compared to other big hospitals in Bangalore. \n\nFor delivery she suggested Cloud9 Jayanagar . It was a normal delivery and I delivered a baby boy. During good whole 10 hours of labour she and her team at cloud9 took care of me very well and now we both are doing fine. Now I need to find equally good paediatrician to show my son:-). Overall you can blindly trust her and follow what she advises without thinking twice, trust me you are in the right hands. Surely I recommend her to my friends and relatives.",

And that's when we decided on Dr. Radha purely based on her reviews at Practo. We used to visit her at Janani clinic. Over the course of time she moved to Apollo Cradle, however, since we were very much confident about her that it didn't bother us.Dr. Radha is very good and experienced in what she does and during the whole pregnancy, we never felt even for once that we have taken wrong decision. She always make sure that her patients get all their queries resolved no matter if you are asking even silly ones. She is very calm and explain the things in detail. My husband always had his own set of questions during every visit and she never failed to answer those. We clearly expressed our wish for going through natural delivery to her and she was always supportive of that - by the way it was natural in the end :) . In conclusion, I definitely recommend Dr. Radha to everyone. Only advise is that you have to be patient as waiting time during appointments is little high. ",

However the time she spends is too less, not much importance given to history and no possibility to consider alternate therapy before prescribing hormonal therapy etc.,\n\nShe did a wonderful job with ovarian cyst removal for my wife but then prescribed a hormonal injection which she said would help stop periods and help with menopause. She did not spend time explaining the side effects or possibly long term effects of this. I feel she should have done this and that would have helped us take an informed decision. My wife is now suffering many side effects of these two injections taken and the periods did not stop (restarted after few months), they have become more painful etc.,  We will never go back again there for any treatment.\n\nIt would have been better if she had spent more time explaining what these injections are for, would they really help, what are the possible side effects, is there really a benefit from these v/s some other methods or not doing anything etc., But now we cannot reverse what has been done, sadly. So have to live with that. This is our story.",

                "review_text": "We went to Dr. Radha after taking treatment from another doctor in one of the leading women's hospital on Sarjapura road. We visited the doctor there for close to a year.  We were having problem in conceiving the child. After many months of trying, the other doctor gave up and asked us to visit fertility clinic in Kormangala. We did visit the fertility clinic and they advised advanced techniques IVF without actually confirming whether there is really a problem or not. After this point, somebody gave us the contact of Dr. Radha Rao. \nIn the first visit itself Dr. Radha said (I remember very clearly)  we will have go through 6 complete cycles before we jump to any conclusion. Also she said we will have to keep track of things with regular medical tests to understand what is happening. She was very much in control of the situation and confident of her skill from the very start. This tracking helped because in the first very  cycle the problem was found and rectified. We completed the whole 9 month time period under her guidance and found her way of working very good. She never created fear or urgency to get any extra medical tests done. On the contrary she told us the need of medical tests and the importance to our particular case. There is a test during the second trimester that cost 40,000/- Rupee and is applicable only to couples where the lady's age is above 34-35 years. She did categorically told us that it is applicable to situations where lady is of higher age and is not necessary in our case. Similar she gave the correct opinion on stem cell banking as well. \nOverall I would recommend Dr. Radha to every body. We stay good 15 km away from Jaya Nagar and the visits to the doctor took full one working day (She does not practice on weekend)  because of traffic and tiredness of travel. But in the end it was all worth it. A good and ethical doctor is very difficult to find and bad ones can do great harm mentally and physically.  And there is a very wide disparity in the skill and experience of various doctors practicing out there. Choose wisely! ",

Doctor is very kind . she treats her patient very well and she interact a lot with her patient and try to find out the correct reason of the the illness.I have visited her in JP nagar Locality. staff behavior and clinic ambiance was also good.\n\nFriendly, efficient front desk staff. Courteous medical staff. Appointment making (and canceling) is a simple process. On line system easy to navigate. Dr Radha is the best! If you are like me you dread going to your annual check up But going to Dr Radha makes it like a interactive session ask what ever you wnat to ask about your health issue . She is caring, gentle, and fast! She makes you feel totally comfortable and is there to listen to you. I am so thankful I switched doctors and found Dr Radha I've never had a bad experience here. Every doctor and nurse I have visited has been extremely helpful, kind, and understanding. The receptionists are wonderful too. I highly recommend them for any and all medical needs.\n\nI really liked Dr Radha - I felt very comfortable with her while under her care.\n",

As i was expecting a long list of medication for my problem but she made it simpler for me.Earlier also approximately one year back i had appointment with her. But that time due to some reason i could not able to continue my treatment so again few days back i have visited to her . I booked my appointment with Practo.I am satisfied with the doctor . I am still following  up the doctor. Now my next appointment is after two months.\n\nDoctor is very patient  she tried to check out the other related problem also and finally conclude the major reason of the problem. I  usually visit to her with appointment when ever i reached in the clinic on the the time of appointment they will attend me on the same time but i fail to attend the appointment then also they try to reschedule my appointment so in that situation only ten to fifteen minutes here and there. Overall they are managing the clinic very efficiently. Trying to avoid the waiting time as much as they can .\n\nI visited her in JP nagar clinic basic facilities are available there in the clinic staff is also professional and helpful . I would definitely like to recommend her.\n\nDr Radha is so great. Super welcoming and informed. Their nurses are so great. Very happy with the entire facility and experiences.",

Her recommendations were practical and she explained the rationale behind everything she prescribed. She allayed our fears and was available on whatsapp to answer our queries. Her bedside manner during delivery was great and that definitely helped calm me and enabled me to deliver my son at full term through normal delivery without an epidural. Overall, I had a positive pregnancy experience and a big part of it was due to Dr.Radha Rao.",

At first consultation Dr diagnosed & said I had polycystic ovaries. After 2 months medication for polycysts I conceived and I'm blessed with a baby boy who is 2 years now. Ma'am assured my complete safety during delivery and encouraged me for a normal delivery. She has a well equipped clinic, so I didnot hav to run around anywhere for my scans and tests during pregnancy. After 2 years of child birth I developed a vaginal infection along with irregular periods for 5 months. With minimal medication prescribed by the Dr within a weeks time i'm feeling almost back to normal. The best qualities I like about madam is she is patient in listening to our problems, very quick and precise in examining the problems of patients and prescribes minimal medicines. *** ** *** ** *** **** ************** ",

In the first month of treatment I conceived and now blessed with beautiful baby girl. She doesn't prescribe unnecessary medication or scans. She suggested diet which I followed as per her advice.She is so friendly and sweet and never rush as you see in other doctors these days. We used to travel 16km to consult her which is really worthy. I had induced vaginal birth with the help of her. She didn't push for c section like other doctors these days.During labour at night she took atmost care for good whole 11 hours of labour. Totally wonderful experience with the doctor and really thankful to her whole heartedly.",

She supported my wife mentally and physically,  she has done nice surgery  and C Section stick healed very quickly.  No unnecessary scanning Or Blood tests. She listens to all your queries patently and give you sufficient time, that's what is need for a patient , that we hardly see in Bangalore..  Highly recommended. We had little complications but the way she guided us, it everything went so smoothly.. \n\nOnce again Thanks Dr Radha for anything to everything. We remember you forever.\n\nDeepak and Gouri. ",

Being out of country and searching for a doctor to do the delivery can be daunting. We just looked at the reviews here and chose Doctor Radha. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION! She oozes confidence and comfort and we were at ease from day 1 of consultation. You can feel free to ask your queries and she is patient. Pre and post delivery care is excellent. Most importantly, she is not one of those doctors who pushes for c-sections. Even though my baby was in full breech position, she got me to wait till 39th week and then did a c-section - that too since i developed severe rashes. All in all, definitely coming to her for baby number 2 :)\n\n- vibha and Amit (Singapore)",

First she has examined me and in every visit she check for the improvement and it all b went very smoothly.I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for an gynecologist because Dr. Radha is really  amazing and i am so lucky to have found her. Dr. Radha came to clinic every day on time and truly made us feel as though we were her only patients. I was a little nervous about when i was visiting her first time but she made me comfortable  and feel free to share my problem with her. The other clinic staff at the clinic were also very professional. Only one area is there where the clinic can improve that there should  be some arrangement so patient should not wait for long time to see the doctor.\n\nOtherwise the doctor is very professional as she gave us the required time to my  check ups, she even shared with us his personal mobile number and email Id to reach her at any time. Thanks Dr Radha yes I highly recommend her.\n",

In my pregnancy we rushed to her as we thought there was no heart beat of baby.  we got her contact through relative and we just went normally let's try out n see. But we never looked back. First thing was she made us calm and asked us few questions and later she gave positive news and response. Throughout my pregnancy she has guided me very well and post pregnancy also she took care of me. very rare to find such doctors. Even I go to her for any kind of periods or stomach issues and she will always help in patience as she is a fantastic listener. Just go to her without second thought! ",
