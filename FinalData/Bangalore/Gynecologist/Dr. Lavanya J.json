She thinks she has more experience so the patient need not have to ask her something or even talk a few words. I never ever recommend this doctor to anyone.

So much of negativity, rudeness and impatience. **** ****** ***** ********* ****** I consulted her for my first pregnancy confirmation, the way she gave her consultation was horrible. She was not even ready to listen to me, prescribed progesterone tablet and told me to take picture in case of pregnancy loss. She thinks she has more experience so the patient need not have to ask her something or even talk a few words. I never ever recommend this doctor to anyone. First of all when a patient visit the doctor all he/she expects is hope, few positive words and good consultation. * **** ** ********** ***** * ********* **** It is really good if the doctor shows some empathy.",

But most of the times, it is not started and the moment we see the patient, we start the tablets. It doesn't require ultrasound to be done before starting the tablets as the tablets are started even before trying for Pregnancy. \nTill 12 weeks of pregnancy, we don't feel anything on examination, only ultrasound will show  us about pregnancy details.\nWe are still in the phase of COVID pandemic,  covid appropriate behavior has to be followed for the safety of all of us. \nAll pregnancies are taken care of with utmost love and care.
