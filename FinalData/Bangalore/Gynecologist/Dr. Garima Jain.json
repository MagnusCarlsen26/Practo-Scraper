Since it was my first pregnancy, I was anxious on variety physical changes which our body goes through when we are pregnant,she helped me understand those are normal and doesn't require any medication, have heard from some of my friends their gynaecologists used to give medication for every silly issues which is not actually required. Also whenever I had any serious concern regarding my baby, she have suggested tests to be sure everything is going right. She recommends doing flexibility and strengthening excersices throughout your pregnancy if you're not having any complications so that you are prepared for a normal delivery physically. She well explained me about labour pain and delivery after my 36 weeks which helped in avoiding confusions and looking for the right symptoms to get admitted for delivery. I could have a normal delivery without any complications with her help. She is extremely positive and you can rely your pregnancy and delivery on her.",

Right from day1 she has been very practical without any exaggeration. \u201cEnjoy each day of pregnancy without complicated thoughts\u201d has been the motto always. She never treated pregnancy as a disease. The first delivery was planned in my native and ended up in a c session. \nFor the second pregnancy I was determined to have a normal delivery. When I introduced this to doctor Garima, she patiently listened and ask me to learn more about VBAC. She gave us a clear picture of the risks and was very pragmatic with her approach towards VBAC. \nFinally on the day of delivery her support helped us attain what we were dreaming for the last 9 months. Without her guidance my VBAC experience would never be so positive. Thank you.",

She never treated pregnancy as a disease. The first delivery was planned in my native and ended up in a c session. \nFor the second pregnancy I was determined to have a normal delivery. When I introduced this to doctor Garima, she patiently listened and ask me to learn more about VBAC. She gave us a clear picture of the risks and was very pragmatic with her approach towards VBAC. \nFinally on the day of delivery her support helped us attain what we were dreaming for the last 9 months. Without her guidance my VBAC experience would never be so positive. Thank you.",
