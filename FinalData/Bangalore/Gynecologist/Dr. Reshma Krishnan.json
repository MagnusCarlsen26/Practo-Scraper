Also while checking current patient, she makes sure her next patients are not waiting unnecessarily in line for long but that also doesn't mean she will overlook current patient. She checks everything and explains those at the end very well.Really liked this that she respects everyone s time and the slot they have booked her for. Giving the feedback after all of my 4 Pregnancy scans. Thank you so much Dr Reshma :) ",
