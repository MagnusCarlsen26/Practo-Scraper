She encouraged me to stay active and do the right exercises at the right time. Even after some complications like cord around the neck, our doctor managed a normal delivery keeping all the safety checks in mind and we trusted her judgement completely.My family was quite impressed with the doctor and her team and how they managed the whole labour and delivery and the post delivery care. We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better OBG, and we recommend her to everyone seeking exceptional prenatal care.",

I thought let's go for the best and and went to a reputed hospital for the MRI scan. The hospital staff connected with Dr. Namita as the MRI was not written on the prescription. Then, she said MRI/CT is not required and just go for Ultrasound. I was ok with it and got a ultrasound done. Today when I took all the reports to her. She as usual very quickly explained, how to and when to take the medicines. I didn't understand some bit and asked her to explain that bit and she lost it. She started talking rudely and loudly.\r\n\r\nI was shocked and Doctor, I wanted to give it back to you right there, but didn't! All because of those grey hair that I could see on you. I know you would read this and my only request to you is to deal with patients \"PATIENTLY\". ",

After a long search and reading lot of reviews we got some confidence to meet and discuss our next course of action. Since day one we got good confidence on her and with every visit this confidence level increased and we decided to proceed for rest of the process with Dr. Namita Kapoor (with a regret why we didn't choose her since start). \n\nWe liked the suggestions and the process she follows for whole consulting process to keep it as Natural as possible. And even when other doctors starts scaring with few natural minor complications like in our case for 1 loop round the neck and other doctors were scaring and forcing us to plan early delivery (cesarean post 32 week or 36 week max) because of this which was not necessary. \n\nDr. Namita checked all the previous scans and reports and said because of this there is no need to plan early delivery. we can still wait till last day (with monitoring baby movements at home) and still Normal delivery can be tried. In case baby do not come down and heartbeat fluctuates while trying then on last day last option will be caesarean otherwise most of the cases Normal delivery is possible. We were convinced with the way she told at least she is still trying for normal delivery and there can be chance we can have baby delivered without caesarean. \n\nOn the Day of delivery. She tried her level best to get baby delivered normally but we can see that every time its tried the baby heartbeat was fluctuating. So considering 2 complications (loop around the neck and baby poop in womb) and heartbeat fluctuation while trying for normal delivery we have to go for emergency caesarean delivery or it will be risk to the baby that we can understand. \n\nOur satisfaction was like Doctor tried her level best for normal delivery that was enough for us to still keep on continuing with Dr. Namita for any of our future need. She is great doctor and this kind of attitude and skills are rare nowadays. I highly recommend Dr Namita to anyone who is really concerned about Normal and Natural process and avoid unnecessary intervention. She has great history of Normal delivery even in some complicated cases with great knowledge and skills.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Namita Kapoor for all the support and taking care of what is needed. I would like to thanks Columbia Asia Hospital too for the seamless process and good arrangements made during the process. And last but not the least thanks to the hospital staff for full support at any time round the clock. ",

                "review_text": "It was one of my best friend who referred me to the Dr. Namita Kapoor Sehgal when I was going to have my first baby.And believe me it was proved to be one of the best descision I have made in the recent past to consult Dr. Namitha. Being first time pregnant my mind was full of questions, concerns & useless unnecessary thought. But after consulting the Dr everything was cleared and my pregnancy journey throughout the baby delivery was smooth & planned. \n     \tDuring these 9 months I got sick many a time but just one advice  from the doctor worked like a charm and I recovered fast. The doctor was always reachable on watsapp/phone during the pregnancy starting 7th months because after this only the critical time of any pregnancy starts as per my experience.\n\t Initially after going through certain feedback on Practo saying the Dr. was little ruude to them I was also little sceptical but believe me I was proved wrong  with each consultation.Since during the first 6-7 months & carrying the 1st baby our mind is full with thousand of unnecessary question so to take care of those the Dr. had to be like a teacher little strict & always caring to tell you what is right & what is wrong.And sometime we want to be told in a certain way that clears our doubt.And then comes the part when you feel connected with the doctor because of the motherly feeling you get when you are with her.\n         My situation was that I was carrying a big baby inside me. My little princess was 4+ kg when she took birth. Still the Dr. left no stone turned to make sure that I go for a normal delivery rather than c-section. Till the due date I could not have my labor pain & there was no point of inducing me as the baby head was not fitted yet in my cervix. And because of this I had to go for a c-section on my 40th week 4th day of pregnancy.As the doctor also predicted before birth that the Baby is 4+ kg in weigh & it was proved to be correct.\n\tBelieve me after 15 days of my operation when I think of all the wild thought & scariness I had for c-section all seems silly. It was all because of Dr. Namita Kapoor that my operation was so smooth it feels like a thing of long past already.Post operation day, I am able to manage my house chores, taking care of my baby all by myself.Already its a so faint scar on my bikini line that it doesn't look line I was ever operated (just passed 15 days from operation day). Now also doctor is always available on a phone call & watsapp (unlike other doctors).\n\tDoctors Care made me feel that I was in safe hands always. Coming to her is like dealing with trusted family. I can never think of consulting any other Dr.. I will blindly & always refer my friends to her & even consult her my 2nd baby if at all I am going for one. :)\n\nA big thumbs up to the doctor & her attitude...!! \nThank you from  me  & my Baby. \nGod bless !!",

She explains every issue very nicely and talks to the point. My consultation experience with her was very nice from starting till now after the delivery.Delivery experience: My edd was 10th june and i did not got natural pains till 9th june so doctor advised me to get admitted the next day for induced pain but i wanted to wait for natural pains and discussed the same with her. She told you can wait few more days if you want but get regular nst and ultrasound scans. We followed the same for next 3 days, everything was normal and i got natural pain on 4th day. Got admitted in hospital and i was only 2 cm dialated, we got to know that baby has passed stool in the womb as we waited post edd. There was panic in OT as there were chances that baby might get infected if he consumes the stool. So doctor told me that she would try for normal delivery for next 30 mins but if baby heartbeat fluctuates then we will go for caserian birth. Thankfully i was fully dialated in next 20 mins and baby heartbeat was constant. Dr. Namita closely monitored everything and took right decisions at that time. I had very smooth natural delivery within 1 hour of getting admitted in hospital. She is very experienced and talented in this field and i would highly recommend everyone to consult her for delivery.I would be thankful to her for my entire life for this normal delivery in such panic situation. She is the best in her field. Thank you so much doctor for this good care and advice.",

She doesn't recommend too many medicines unless it is required.\n\n2. With the gud opinion visited her for my second pregnancy.  I had diabetes from my first trimester itself. So she referred me to an endocrinologist who is very gud indeed.  she wanted all the scans to be done by the specialist who are very good.  She guided me very well.  \nShe is easily approachable both by mobile and in hospital. \nThough my first delivery was c section,  she wanted me to go for normal delivery for the second one.  She wanted to wait till my due date.  But I was mentally very  weak to bare the last month pain and restlessness.  I have visited her atleast 3 times in 10 days in the tenth month. Everytime I visit her I will go with some complain that not able to breathe,  sleep,  eat,  walk though I know that these all natural problems in the last month. She will console me and send back to home. \n\nEverytime we go,  my husband  used to ask too many questions.  But she was so polite to answer everything.\n\nShe also clearly explained the hospital procedures for delivery. \n\nFinally I ended up in c section in 38 weeks. I didn't want to take risk of normal delivery.  My husband somehow convinced the doctor.  \n\nEven during operation she told me that I could have waited for normal delivery becoz my previous scar has healed well. \n\nThroughout this 9 months she was very caring,  approachable even at 11 PM n also strict abt my diet becoz of diabetes. \n\nI would highly recommend her for all.

The way Dr. Namita guided us at each stage, each passing week and giving the best of the advice which helped us to get a healthy and safe delivery with near to full term.\n\nDuring the initial scan we discovered that the pregnancy was with bicornuate uterus and in the right horn, this having a risk of early or pre-term labor and also impact baby's growth. Looking to this Dr. Namita suggested to go for a cervical cerclage. As this is very new to us and first time we are very skeptical about this and we did some online study to understand what are the Pros and Cons of doing a Cerclage, Honestly Cercalage is still not common in India and we hardly found any supportive or relevant feedback. (Most of them are from US or other part of world).\n\nWe decided to trust the doctor and her experience and did a cervical cerclage and it has given a expected result as the Pregnancy able to cover near to full term (37 Week) with a normal growth for the baby.\nDuring the 37 week as we found that due to some impact on Liver we need to take a decision to hold till 40 Week and wait for labor or to go for a C-sec as this liver dysfunctioning can cause health issue with mother. Dr. Namita discussed all possibilities with us and we decided to go for C-sec as baby is fully grown and we do not want to risk mother health.\n\nOn the final day Dr. Namita spent an hour with us explaining about the C-sec and pre and post procedure and risk. (Which you hardly expect in India by any doctor).\n\nTo summarize we high appreciate and thank full to Dr. Namita to be there and advising us to have the most precious gift of life.\n\nWith sincere thanks from Swati, Tarun & Little Hridaya.\n ",

We got her reference from Practo itself and based on the review experience and ratings, we decided to go to her initially. Being apprehensive as all to-be parents are, we were not sure of anything in the beginning. But after a couple of visits we were confidant of one thing, if not anything else, that she would be the doctor we wanted to continue for the entire time. Dr. Namita is straight-forward and precise to a point where it might be considered rude by some, but in our experience we realized that, this specific attribute is what we required to be in our doctor. She would not spend time in unnecessary details and explanation not pertinent to the well-being of the baby and the parent. Our session with her were short, precise, to the point and detailed with respect to relevance. She never prescribed any test or medicines which would not be imperative to the baby's or mothers health and constructive progress throughout the course of 9 months. She specifically mentioned what and where to do the test and not to go for any unnecessary expenses. My wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter at exactly 40 + 1 week. Dr.Namita\u2019s support was the maximum at the end. We had opted for a normal delivery, she also supported the same. For my wife however, the pain did not come on its own, even on the due date, Dr.Namita was fully patient and wanted to wait for normal, and went for an induced pain. After 3 inducements, my wife started responding, it was almost 24 hours the contraction pain started, it was taking her a long time to go into labor, but Dr Namita was willing to wait even more and explained everything to us in pristine detail. It was completely our decision to go for a C-section, even though she told us there\u2019s a good possibility of a normal delivery, only it would require little more time. Once our decision was done and confirmed she took my wife to the OT. Within 15-20 min the operation was done and my wife and our daughter came out all well and healthy. Even on the 2 days my wife was admitted for recovery, Dr.Namita came on regular visits checked her thoroughly and prescribed very little medicine. She was discharged from the hospital within 2 days all healthy and fine.\nAs I mentioned above, the experience was nothing short of brilliant in every aspect with full support and precise treatment. \nThank you Dr. Namita.\n",

She encouraged me to stay active and do the right exercises at the right time. Even after some complications like cord around the neck, our doctor managed a normal delivery keeping all the safety checks in mind and we trusted her judgement completely.My family was quite impressed with the doctor and her team and how they managed the whole labour and delivery and the post delivery care. We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better OBG, and we recommend her to everyone seeking exceptional prenatal care.",

I thought let's go for the best and and went to a reputed hospital for the MRI scan. The hospital staff connected with Dr. Namita as the MRI was not written on the prescription. Then, she said MRI/CT is not required and just go for Ultrasound. I was ok with it and got a ultrasound done. Today when I took all the reports to her. She as usual very quickly explained, how to and when to take the medicines. I didn't understand some bit and asked her to explain that bit and she lost it. She started talking rudely and loudly.\r\n\r\nI was shocked and Doctor, I wanted to give it back to you right there, but didn't! All because of those grey hair that I could see on you. I know you would read this and my only request to you is to deal with patients \"PATIENTLY\". ",

After a long search and reading lot of reviews we got some confidence to meet and discuss our next course of action. Since day one we got good confidence on her and with every visit this confidence level increased and we decided to proceed for rest of the process with Dr. Namita Kapoor (with a regret why we didn't choose her since start). \n\nWe liked the suggestions and the process she follows for whole consulting process to keep it as Natural as possible. And even when other doctors starts scaring with few natural minor complications like in our case for 1 loop round the neck and other doctors were scaring and forcing us to plan early delivery (cesarean post 32 week or 36 week max) because of this which was not necessary. \n\nDr. Namita checked all the previous scans and reports and said because of this there is no need to plan early delivery. we can still wait till last day (with monitoring baby movements at home) and still Normal delivery can be tried. In case baby do not come down and heartbeat fluctuates while trying then on last day last option will be caesarean otherwise most of the cases Normal delivery is possible. We were convinced with the way she told at least she is still trying for normal delivery and there can be chance we can have baby delivered without caesarean. \n\nOn the Day of delivery. She tried her level best to get baby delivered normally but we can see that every time its tried the baby heartbeat was fluctuating. So considering 2 complications (loop around the neck and baby poop in womb) and heartbeat fluctuation while trying for normal delivery we have to go for emergency caesarean delivery or it will be risk to the baby that we can understand. \n\nOur satisfaction was like Doctor tried her level best for normal delivery that was enough for us to still keep on continuing with Dr. Namita for any of our future need. She is great doctor and this kind of attitude and skills are rare nowadays. I highly recommend Dr Namita to anyone who is really concerned about Normal and Natural process and avoid unnecessary intervention. She has great history of Normal delivery even in some complicated cases with great knowledge and skills.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Namita Kapoor for all the support and taking care of what is needed. I would like to thanks Columbia Asia Hospital too for the seamless process and good arrangements made during the process. And last but not the least thanks to the hospital staff for full support at any time round the clock. ",

                "review_text": "It was one of my best friend who referred me to the Dr. Namita Kapoor Sehgal when I was going to have my first baby.And believe me it was proved to be one of the best descision I have made in the recent past to consult Dr. Namitha. Being first time pregnant my mind was full of questions, concerns & useless unnecessary thought. But after consulting the Dr everything was cleared and my pregnancy journey throughout the baby delivery was smooth & planned. \n     \tDuring these 9 months I got sick many a time but just one advice  from the doctor worked like a charm and I recovered fast. The doctor was always reachable on watsapp/phone during the pregnancy starting 7th months because after this only the critical time of any pregnancy starts as per my experience.\n\t Initially after going through certain feedback on Practo saying the Dr. was little ruude to them I was also little sceptical but believe me I was proved wrong  with each consultation.Since during the first 6-7 months & carrying the 1st baby our mind is full with thousand of unnecessary question so to take care of those the Dr. had to be like a teacher little strict & always caring to tell you what is right & what is wrong.And sometime we want to be told in a certain way that clears our doubt.And then comes the part when you feel connected with the doctor because of the motherly feeling you get when you are with her.\n         My situation was that I was carrying a big baby inside me. My little princess was 4+ kg when she took birth. Still the Dr. left no stone turned to make sure that I go for a normal delivery rather than c-section. Till the due date I could not have my labor pain & there was no point of inducing me as the baby head was not fitted yet in my cervix. And because of this I had to go for a c-section on my 40th week 4th day of pregnancy.As the doctor also predicted before birth that the Baby is 4+ kg in weigh & it was proved to be correct.\n\tBelieve me after 15 days of my operation when I think of all the wild thought & scariness I had for c-section all seems silly. It was all because of Dr. Namita Kapoor that my operation was so smooth it feels like a thing of long past already.Post operation day, I am able to manage my house chores, taking care of my baby all by myself.Already its a so faint scar on my bikini line that it doesn't look line I was ever operated (just passed 15 days from operation day). Now also doctor is always available on a phone call & watsapp (unlike other doctors).\n\tDoctors Care made me feel that I was in safe hands always. Coming to her is like dealing with trusted family. I can never think of consulting any other Dr.. I will blindly & always refer my friends to her & even consult her my 2nd baby if at all I am going for one. :)\n\nA big thumbs up to the doctor & her attitude...!! \nThank you from  me  & my Baby. \nGod bless !!",

She explains every issue very nicely and talks to the point. My consultation experience with her was very nice from starting till now after the delivery.Delivery experience: My edd was 10th june and i did not got natural pains till 9th june so doctor advised me to get admitted the next day for induced pain but i wanted to wait for natural pains and discussed the same with her. She told you can wait few more days if you want but get regular nst and ultrasound scans. We followed the same for next 3 days, everything was normal and i got natural pain on 4th day. Got admitted in hospital and i was only 2 cm dialated, we got to know that baby has passed stool in the womb as we waited post edd. There was panic in OT as there were chances that baby might get infected if he consumes the stool. So doctor told me that she would try for normal delivery for next 30 mins but if baby heartbeat fluctuates then we will go for caserian birth. Thankfully i was fully dialated in next 20 mins and baby heartbeat was constant. Dr. Namita closely monitored everything and took right decisions at that time. I had very smooth natural delivery within 1 hour of getting admitted in hospital. She is very experienced and talented in this field and i would highly recommend everyone to consult her for delivery.I would be thankful to her for my entire life for this normal delivery in such panic situation. She is the best in her field. Thank you so much doctor for this good care and advice.",

She doesn't recommend too many medicines unless it is required.\n\n2. With the gud opinion visited her for my second pregnancy.  I had diabetes from my first trimester itself. So she referred me to an endocrinologist who is very gud indeed.  she wanted all the scans to be done by the specialist who are very good.  She guided me very well.  \nShe is easily approachable both by mobile and in hospital. \nThough my first delivery was c section,  she wanted me to go for normal delivery for the second one.  She wanted to wait till my due date.  But I was mentally very  weak to bare the last month pain and restlessness.  I have visited her atleast 3 times in 10 days in the tenth month. Everytime I visit her I will go with some complain that not able to breathe,  sleep,  eat,  walk though I know that these all natural problems in the last month. She will console me and send back to home. \n\nEverytime we go,  my husband  used to ask too many questions.  But she was so polite to answer everything.\n\nShe also clearly explained the hospital procedures for delivery. \n\nFinally I ended up in c section in 38 weeks. I didn't want to take risk of normal delivery.  My husband somehow convinced the doctor.  \n\nEven during operation she told me that I could have waited for normal delivery becoz my previous scar has healed well. \n\nThroughout this 9 months she was very caring,  approachable even at 11 PM n also strict abt my diet becoz of diabetes. \n\nI would highly recommend her for all.

The way Dr. Namita guided us at each stage, each passing week and giving the best of the advice which helped us to get a healthy and safe delivery with near to full term.\n\nDuring the initial scan we discovered that the pregnancy was with bicornuate uterus and in the right horn, this having a risk of early or pre-term labor and also impact baby's growth. Looking to this Dr. Namita suggested to go for a cervical cerclage. As this is very new to us and first time we are very skeptical about this and we did some online study to understand what are the Pros and Cons of doing a Cerclage, Honestly Cercalage is still not common in India and we hardly found any supportive or relevant feedback. (Most of them are from US or other part of world).\n\nWe decided to trust the doctor and her experience and did a cervical cerclage and it has given a expected result as the Pregnancy able to cover near to full term (37 Week) with a normal growth for the baby.\nDuring the 37 week as we found that due to some impact on Liver we need to take a decision to hold till 40 Week and wait for labor or to go for a C-sec as this liver dysfunctioning can cause health issue with mother. Dr. Namita discussed all possibilities with us and we decided to go for C-sec as baby is fully grown and we do not want to risk mother health.\n\nOn the final day Dr. Namita spent an hour with us explaining about the C-sec and pre and post procedure and risk. (Which you hardly expect in India by any doctor).\n\nTo summarize we high appreciate and thank full to Dr. Namita to be there and advising us to have the most precious gift of life.\n\nWith sincere thanks from Swati, Tarun & Little Hridaya.\n ",

We got her reference from Practo itself and based on the review experience and ratings, we decided to go to her initially. Being apprehensive as all to-be parents are, we were not sure of anything in the beginning. But after a couple of visits we were confidant of one thing, if not anything else, that she would be the doctor we wanted to continue for the entire time. Dr. Namita is straight-forward and precise to a point where it might be considered rude by some, but in our experience we realized that, this specific attribute is what we required to be in our doctor. She would not spend time in unnecessary details and explanation not pertinent to the well-being of the baby and the parent. Our session with her were short, precise, to the point and detailed with respect to relevance. She never prescribed any test or medicines which would not be imperative to the baby's or mothers health and constructive progress throughout the course of 9 months. She specifically mentioned what and where to do the test and not to go for any unnecessary expenses. My wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter at exactly 40 + 1 week. Dr.Namita\u2019s support was the maximum at the end. We had opted for a normal delivery, she also supported the same. For my wife however, the pain did not come on its own, even on the due date, Dr.Namita was fully patient and wanted to wait for normal, and went for an induced pain. After 3 inducements, my wife started responding, it was almost 24 hours the contraction pain started, it was taking her a long time to go into labor, but Dr Namita was willing to wait even more and explained everything to us in pristine detail. It was completely our decision to go for a C-section, even though she told us there\u2019s a good possibility of a normal delivery, only it would require little more time. Once our decision was done and confirmed she took my wife to the OT. Within 15-20 min the operation was done and my wife and our daughter came out all well and healthy. Even on the 2 days my wife was admitted for recovery, Dr.Namita came on regular visits checked her thoroughly and prescribed very little medicine. She was discharged from the hospital within 2 days all healthy and fine.\nAs I mentioned above, the experience was nothing short of brilliant in every aspect with full support and precise treatment. \nThank you Dr. Namita.\n",

We thanked God for choosing Dr Namita for our child's delivery.\r\n\r\nBeing New to Bangalore we did not had any idea which hospital is good and which Gynac to consult . We walked in to Columbia Asia hospital with a fear( I believe all have this fear ) that whether we are making a right choice and whether we will get a good doctor , today we feel vindicated that we made a perfect choice . \r\n\r\nWhen we first met her , we found her very friendly and knowledgeable, with whom we could discuss any issues we faced . She was available on call anytime and in case she was not available on call you could easily send her an message and she responded to each and every query . \r\n\r\nAlso she never suggested any unnecessary tests and advised us very correctly in case of physiotherapy and other pregnancy related costs.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of pregnancy she guided us on every minute thing to take care of and become more of a caring friend then a doctor  . As we desired for a normal delivery she suggested what all will be helpful . And truly each and every of her advise helped . \r\n\r\nDuring the last trimester she gave us a clear way ahead preparing us for a course of delivery and the best caring part of her was that she told us that I am available 24X7 now ( on phone text or in person) . And we could call her at any odd hour whenever we felt some issue was there . \r\n\r\nIn my 9th month due to some complications ( Liver been impacted) Dr Namita took a wise decision to prepone my delivery by 3 weeks and I delivered a healthy angel  by normal delivery. \r\n\r\nEven after delivery she readily answers our queries on phone and whatsapp even though we have shifted to Delhi now .  \r\n\r\nWith this brief testimony we would thank to D Namita and would say when we look back without a hint of doubt I will say Dr Namita is one of the best Gynac . \r\n\r\nA Big Thank You and God Bless you . Will always drop by to say Hello to you whenever I visit Bangalore in future :-) ",

I visited Practo and saw good rating for Dr. Namita and booked the first appointment in Medal Clumax in Marathahalli. After our first appointment we both were sure of our choice. Then we switched to Columbia Asia Hospital (Dr. Namita also visits there) as the various tests and the Labour room as well as OT were upto the mark. She guided us patiently and sometime treated like a mom (because my wife had GD and TSH) and was very strict for blood sugar level monitoring as well as keep a tab on her weight gain. Finally on 10th February 2017 we were blessed with a baby boy and we bid adieu to Dr. Namita Kapoor. We made the right choice to consult with Dr. Namita and we would strongly recommend if you want a well experienced, ************* Gyno who is also extremely patient, kind and friendly. Thank you Doctor :)\n\nRegards,\nSamir Bose & Subhalaxmi Jena",

Though we wished for normal delivery, It didn't happen as my wife had water break three weeks before due date. The Medical Parameters in NST Test were not in supportive of normal delivery. So, We had to go for C-Section. When it comes to doctor, she has been very good and supportive in this period. We had so many questions in mind as it was our first baby. Doctor cleared all our doubts time to time. She was always open to clear our doubts. We are extremely happy with doctor the way she treats patients. I still remember we phoned her at 4:50 A.M on the day of delivery. she picked the call and guided us.But, We aren't too happy with the hospital where we got the treatment. Dr. Namita Kapoor is consultant doctor in other hospitals also like ColumbiaAsia, Fortis. When we decided to choose hospital, We opted for Apollo Cradle, Brookfield As it is close to our residence though we had read so many good reviews about this doctor with Columbia Asia. The reason for not rating the hospital very high is I had seen so much irresponsibility in the staff, mis coordination between different teams, not properly working medical equipment. Hope my review helps others in choosing their doctor and hospital.",

Immediately after meeting her, I decided in one meeting that she was the right doctor for me.\n\nIt was tough to change the doctor in the 8th month especially with complications in the pregnancy , but after I began consulting her, things became really smooth.\n\n**  ****** ** * ********* *** ************* ****** *** ****** ***** **** ** *** ********* She was vibrant and joyful in the OT,  when it's most required. I recall being very nervous during the prep in the OT, but with her arrival I became calm and relaxed. \n\nThe best thing is her ability to handle cases with utmost clarity and confidence. She spends a lot of time with her patients answering each query and explaining everything in detail. It really helped me understand the issues I had. She is the only doctor who isn't in a rush for the patient to leave quickly , I find that quality highly commendable and rare these days.\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr Namita to all expecting mothers!\n",

I came back to Bangalore from my hometown and was in search of a good doctor who is also inclined towards normal delivery. I had heard all kinds of horror stories about doctors being in hurry and opt for C-section. \nI read good reviews about Dr. Namita online and decided to see her once and then take my call. Trust me, after meeting her first time itself, my worries were all gone and I became extremely assured for my rest of the pregnancy journey, and I was right :)\nDr. Namita talks to the point and explains everything in detail. If you've done some research & know things in medical terms, then also she will be happy about it and explains rest of it, unlike other doctors who get offended  (I don't understand why). \nShe takes care of the baby like her own till the end. Her positive attitude towards everything calms you down instantly. The tests and the medications are to the point. She does not suggest to go for meds unless really needed. She shares her number later in Pregnancy for the doubts or any emergency and responds via whatsapp too. In fact, post delivery too.\n\nI was so relaxed throughout my pregnancy as I knew I was in safest hands. I could focus on my diet, exercises and baby:) And my baby was delivered Vaginally.  I am so grateful to Dr. Namita for delivering my baby safe & sound and treating this pregnancy like her own:) Thanks Dr. for everything!!",

You can reach out to her and she is very prompt in her response. I was lucky to have chosen her for my pregnancy and i can say it was my nice decision. I fall short of  wards telling about her but definitely i suggest all the pregnant women to consult Dr. Namita Kapoor to make their pregnancy  a beautiful  experience !! My Birth story goes like this .\nI was admitted on 1st July  in the morning  due to some complications and chances for normal vs C-section  was 50-50 but Dr. aim was to induce a normal delivery while while constantly accessing  the baby growth and risk parameters. Closer towards the delivery she ensured close monitoring and always available on the call. In the afternoon at 3:40 pm i was blessed with the baby girl via normal delivery. Even if i say 1000 times thanks to her it is less. I will always be very very grateful to her and she is the most amazing gynecologists' i have ever met.",

I had a previous IUD at 39 weeks with a different doctor, so it was really important for me to find an experienced and skilled doctor to manage my high risk pregnancy. During my 2nd trimester, my NT scan indicated a possible anomaly. This period was really stressful and scary but Dr. Namita was calm and practical. She explained the implications and possible outcomes, guided us on the next steps and recommended us to to the best tertiary scan centre (BFMC) and doctor (Dr. Prathima). \n\nThroughout the pregnancy, Dr. Namita was forthcoming, caring and transparent. I had fluctuating glucose levels throughout my pregnancy and she provided timely advice on action to be taken and experts to be consulted with. Her aim was to induce a normal delivery while constantly assessing the baby's growth and risk parameters. Closer towards the delivery, she ensured close monitoring and was always available on call. I had a normal delivery and I was blessed with my bundle of joy in May this year. I'm so deeply grateful to Dr. Namita for her calm demeanour, transparency and decisiveness. Thank you so much, you're a God send :)",

I am blessed to have been under her care for the entire course of my pregnancy. \nShe is straight forward and precise and does not believe in c sections unless there is a dire need and will always encourage normal deliveries. She does not recommend unnecessary tests/ medicines. I had a borderline case of gestational diabetes but was able to manage it through diet control only..thanks to the doc's care, continuous monitoring and advise. It was my first pregnancy and weight was an issue too as I was already overweight when I got pregnant. She helped me keep that on track as well..finally...I was overdue and did not experience labour pain naturally. She insisted we wait till the last possible day. My baby was already 3.9 kgs when we decided to induce labour..and guess what! It was a normal delivery within 9 hours of induction..\nI would say..just follow her lead, do as she advises...u will be assured of the best possible care there is! Thank you Dr.Namita..",

She also took good post natal care of me by giving good advices. \r\n\r\nPost delivery when she used to come for the rounds her care for me used to make me feel very comfortable as if a mother is talking to her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is indeed very caring and very knowledgeable and very down to earth doctor.

Then I decide to change doctor than I got know about DR NAMITA  from my friend and after meeting her ,we felt like she is my family member and advising right things to us and we were very happy to discuss each and every small doubt . As usual being first time pregnant our mind was full of questions, concerns and unnecessary thought. But in our case we were having more questions and concerns about me and baby as I was epilepsy patient. I am very afraid about my fits , there were chance to come fits again because of pain but doctor has already told how to handle this all the situation .She explained the whole 9 month journey since it is first pregnancy with epilepsy and she is always open to answer the doubts we have at any time even in nights also. At the time of delivery I got admitted on a Saturday evening and she called duty dr and explained about situation and clearly told to duty dr keep all the injection/medicine ready for emergency and I was really very happy when she came after finishing her OPT(around 8:30 PM) and asked duty doctor show me where is all the medicine/injection which I suggested for emergency .she explain each and every thing what we are going to do now and she told I will leave now but you can call any time in night. Also duty doctor will update me whenever you are ready to deliver. Finally that time came after 5 hours and time was 1 oclock in night. Duty doctor informed her she reached hospital after 15-20 mins . then she started her magic and after 15 min one more member added in our family. Both baby and mother were fine . We were so happy and more thankful to doctor   \n  \nShe is such a good soul. I will blindly refer my friends to her.\nA big thumbs up to the doctor and her attitude...!!",

She explained the whole 9 month journey since it is first\npregnancy and she is always open to answer the doubts we have at anytime even in nights also.\nAt the time of delivery I got admitted on a sunday evening and she called duty doctor and got to know the\nstatus and asked duty doctor to induce pain at\u00a010:30PM. She called up my personal number to keep me\nupdated the situation and the way she gonna treat me. She also informed us ,if any emergency she will come\nanytime at night . Since no emergency, she visited me at morning 6:00AM.\u00a0She monitored everything and\ncame to know that baby&#39;s heart rate is going down to 100/sec. She don\u2019t want to take risk and she asked us to\ngo for C-section. Still my dilation was good and she preferred to wait for normal delivery . After the wait for 2 to\n3 hours we met our happiness at monday morning\u00a011:31 by normal delivery itself. Both baby and mother were fine . We were so happy\nand more thankful to doctor\u00a0 \u00a0\nDoctors Care made us feel that we were in safe and secure hand. Consulting her is like dealing with trusted\nfamily. She is such a good soul. I will blindly refer my friends to her.\nA big thumbs up to the doctor &amp; her attitude...!!",

When I met her for the first time , the complete conversation was crisp and to the point. Like everyone else I was skeptical whether my decision is apt. My subsequent appointments proved  me **** **** ** *** **** ****** * ***** ********* **** *** ********* *** experience what I realized later and admired ,was her style of communicating the balanced  information to me as we belong to too-much -info at-click generation.Her style infused such a trust into me that I never googled about anything and hence lived a stress free pregnancy period.Dr Namita has a great sense of what is going on in patient's mind and will articulate the answers to satiate completely.Her punctuality and discipline about appointments and timing being a dr really left me with a feel of marvel.She duly informed whenever emergency striked and ensure I am comfortable with next meeting. I delivered a happy princess in Sep 2017 and enjoyed normal delivery\n\nI would like to say Thank you to Dr Namita for being such a nice doctor and partner in my journey.Kudos to you :)",

Right from the beginning ( before conceiving ) she gave us a  detailed explanation of how and why the fibroid causes issues in conception and pregnancy.  But she said we should go ahead and try to conceive because there is no point in trying to remove the fibroid and then planning. If it causes any issues then we could discuss removal. Luckily we got pregnant within a month , she constantly kept check on the fibroid and prescribed medicines to avoid pre term labor. She was always pro normal delivery in my case , but ultimately had to induce labor at 38 weeks due to high BP and IHCP . Labor unfortunately did not progress as expected so had to choose a C section . Overall could not have asked for a better Dr for my first pregnancy ",

She motivates a lot for natural labor and my whole labor and delivery experience was satisfying.

She is straightforward and recommends what is good for us, she made sure that I don't panic and always made sure to ask if i have any questions regarding anything related to pregnancy, since it was our first baby. I trusted my doctor very much. She asked me to stay active, suggested activites for normal delivery. She never questioned about early delivery, and  definitely tried her best for normal delivery, but due to fetal distress had to go for emergency c-sec. Even post delivery, she was always there to check on me. On the next day of delivery she herself came in to help me walk. She is quite caring. I would hands down recommend Dr Namita for pregnancies and delivery.",

In an age when operative births are more common than vaginal deliveries, Namita Ma'am encouraged me for vaginal delivery and made my experience so comfortable. Ma'am never caused me unnecessary stress or ordered unnecessary tests. She made my pregnancy journey a seamless and natural process and put me at ease each time I had any questions. She cared for me like my mother and encouraged me a lot in the labour room. Her care for patients doesn't stop at delivery and she continues to care post delivery as well. Without any doubts I would recommend Namita Ma'am for pregnancies and delivery as well as any other women health issues. ",

So will not listen you completely.\n->Most importantly She will ask you to install an app in your mobile and communicate with her through that app..there she will charge you for chating and separate charges to share reports in that app.\n->Highly not recommended this doctor.\n->The last and least:  By mistake if you couldn't understand any point and  you asked again then you are GONE. She will blast on you.\n\nAfter this we change the doctor. Doctor abc in xyz hospital she is very polite and without asking gave us mobile no. And asked her that we can whatsapp her anytime any report. She told she may reply with some delay but she will reply. In emergency we can call her also.",

Though doctor looks strict by nature, its for benefit of patient itself. As I had recently knee surgery done, my family was not inclined towards  normal delivery. But doctor took care of me like family member and inspired to go for normal delivery. I delivered baby[normal] at Columbia Asia,Whitefield  under her care. Baby is very healthy and even my health is back to normal in quick time. She is very dynamic and caring. Thank you doctor. ",

My baby boy was born by emergency CSection on 15 January 2017, as he had passed muconium in the last moment. I had a blissful experience with Dr. Namita.

Then we decided to go by 'Practo' reviews. Dr. Namita Kapoor has a decent set of reviews to give us the confidence that she is the one that we wanted to go with.\n\nWe used to meet her regularly during month's and later in two weeks interval. The consultation would be to the point and we were asked to do minimal required scans/tests. She shared her phone no after completion of 36th week of pregnancy, we were free to reach her directly in case of any emergency.\n\nOur baby was born on June 24th at Columbia Asia Whitefield and we are happy to share that it was a normal delivery. Despite of it being a Sunday Namita madam was personally present during the delivery time - we cannot thank her enough and of course we need to mention about the Columbia Asia labor room staff.\n\nAmrit & Abhilasha",

We told the same to doctor and she made sure that all aspects of my wife's and the baby's health are taken care of right from day one. My baby had multiple issues right from week 12. Dr. Namita made sure that no stones were left unturned to check the health of the baby and the mother. She always went an extra mile ahead of her duties and always kept us reassured and we always knew that no matter what, doctor is always with us! She was no less than a mother to my wife! We would always strongly recommend Dr. Namita Kapoor Sahgal to any would be parents. Also we would strongly recommend COLUMBIA ASIA Whitefield for pregnancy related issues and Neonatology! Thank you ma'am for whatever you have done for us!  You were truely God sent! ",

Once I broke down when I was not able to control my sugar even after trying hard and Dr. Namita consoled me like mother and reassured that everything will be fine.\n\nThe most best part of my pregnancy was Dr. Namita never forced me to for cesarean even there was no any sign of pain till due date. She waited for 1 extra day and finally I had normal delivery. Thanks a lot Namita mam.\n",

We never waited for more  than 30 min during 3 months of our visit to the Dr. With other Drs we used to wait for more than 1 hr. \n2) Dr gives enough time during each visit( 10 to 15 min each time). She never hurry up during consultation. I used to ask lots of question and she answered all of them.\n3) She gave her emergency contact number to us in last trimester and she used reply small queries over phone.  We found her very responsive. \n\nNow that my wife has delivered and outcome is good, we are happy and satisfied with all the treatment we received from the Dr Namita.  We will consult her for all our future need. \n\nHope this will help to make you informed decision. ",

What I liked the most and appreciated the most about her is she made my elder daughter get involved in everything possible. My daughter was made to feel a part of my pregnancy which I feel won us over . And during delivery she was patient and very understanding! And my delivery experience was super awesome ! Most importantly , she made sure I exercised and didn't make me feel I am sick. She made me feel pregnant and I can go about my life normally as long as I was healthy.

In my last sonography we found out that our baby was little big and till the end the baby's head was not engaged but inspite of all that she said she will try for normal delivery.\r\nBecause of her assurance and support I could have a normal delivery when I lost all the hopes. \r\nA big big thanks to Dr. Namita for bringing our bundle of joy in this world.\r\nI would like to highly recommend her to others.",

She and her team of doctors in Columbia Asia Whitefield were amazing during the delivery. During the pregnancy she provided right kind of advice, explained risks associated with VBAC and was always available for any  queries, even through SMS and phone.  I loved the way she enquired about the baby and my recovery post delivery. I thank her for being such wonderful support and strongly recommend consulting Dr.Namita especially if you are particular about normal delivery.",

She was very professional and always advised for the normal delivery since our condition was favorable for normal delivery. She also advised prenatal exercise and never rushed for the delivery date. She always prefer to wait till the last expected date of delivery. But due to some other unavoidable situation we had to go for a C section and it went very smoothly under the skilled hand of Dr. Namita kapoor. The procedure and post delivery issues got minimized very quickly and we both were completely satisfied by the warmth and care Dr has shown towards our pre and post delivery time period. \nI would strongly recommend Dr Namita Kapoor to all expecting mothers.",

We visited her when I was in my second trimester. \nShe is very clear about her instructions and as time went by we mostly met her through video chat. Because of her guidance, all went smoothly without any medical complications. Later in the stage, she gave me moral support and encourage me to go for normal delivery. \nFinally, The lucky day came and we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. I would like to thank Dr Namita and her team for their support and guidance throughout my pregnancy journey.  ",

She was quick to diagnose what monitoring I need. Knowing the intricacies of hospital functions, she helped me get scans and tests done from the best doctors. She is very approachable when needed. In my case towards the end of the pregnancy, we had to be very careful. She was very vigilant and helped me to be as well. I highly recommend the doctor to anyone.",

We opted for C-section because baby's head was not fixed in the lower part of mother even in 40th week. Also, mother got gestational diabetes in the last few days and we felt that baby movements were growing weaker with days. We didn't want to take risk and, after consulting with doctor, opted to go for C-section 5 days before the due date. Baby was born healthy with little more than 3.6kg weight. We are very happy and satisfied that we were under Dr Namita's guidance throughout. Due to her friendly attitude, we could clarify any of our doubts with her. She doesn't suggest unnecessary medicine, nutrition supplements or tests. She was keen towards normal delivery till the end, but because of unfavorable conditions, we had to go for C-section. I will recommend Dr Namita to everybody.",

When I had doubts on baby's movements , she was there to guide me. During labour, she comforted me with her positive words and helped me to stay calm.\nShe assured me I could have a normal delivery and yes I had a health girl baby through NVD. Thank you Dr.Namita",

She is a patient listener and gives prescription only after proper diagnosis and understanding. Her priority is always health of the mother and baby thus she never prescribes any unnecessary medicine. Her explanations are satisfying which was important for me as it was my first pregnancy. She advised me to remain healthy(food, exercise) so that normal delivery can be done. During entire course of pregnancy and labour, her approach was very systematic. Also in labour room, her comforting words and friendliness made me feel better. Finally, I delivered a healthy baby via normal delivery. Thank you doctor Namita for such an awesome experience. I would highly recommend Dr. Namita to everyone. ",

Right from day 0 she has been a great listener ,support and helped me go through the most crucial stage of my pregnancy smoothly. She demonstrated a very high level of maturity and was always in control of situation.  Dr. Kapoor is not just a pro in her field but also very sensitive towards my elder son and made sure that he felt part of the entire process.\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Namita Kapoor.\nThanks again doctor. You are the ROCKSTAR for my children.\nRegards\nAnanya & Sourabh\n",

She encourages normal / natural delivery and is a great help at hand. She was in constant touch on phone with my husband guiding throughout the labor until the time came. She also visited multiple times to check as well.\n\nI would definitely recommend the doctor. She is just amazing. Thank you so much Doctor Namita.",

She was not robotic or mechanical and treated me with warmth. With the passing phase of my pregnancy I developed a few complications which were really taken care of well by her. Today I'm the proud mother of a 12 day baby daughter and I really can't thank her enough for the support and care that she extended. I would highly recommend her for any normal to high risk pregnancy. Thank you for everything ma'am... SUMI :)",

The day I got to know that I might be expecting , we met her at Yashomati hospital and from the very first minute me and my husband got very good vibes. We then carried on the treatment with her at Columbia Asia whitefield. She cared for me as my mother does and always answered to all our queries with so much of patience which helped me throughout my pregnancy. I would just call her any point of the day and she would be there to give me the right advice. She thought me how to be patient and take proper care of myself which helped me deliver a normal baby. \r\nMe and my family cannot thank her enough for all the support, love and care she showered on me. \r\nIf u want to have a stress free pregnancy I would surely recommend you to meet her once.",

I am really thankful for her patience and guidance that helped us to be a proud parents of a cute baby boy.With these complexity she never let down the hopes in us to go for a normal delivery but due to some unavoidable circumstances we had to go for c-section. I would whole heartedly recommend  Dr.Namita for the people who are looking for a good OBG in and around Bangalore.Thank you so much Mam for your valuable guidance and support!",

But after the first visit, I was very confident. In very early stages, she identified my hypo-thryrodism problem and treated me in right time. She has very good patience to answer all the questions that I had. Because of too much nausea, I couldn't eat much, leading to anemic condition and low baby weight. But she took good decisions and helped me to reach the required baby weight easily. I was not given any unwanted medicine. In third trimester, GERD problem increased, instead of giving medicines, she gave me small changes that I can do to my lifestyle and sleeping postures, which helped me a lot. \n\nDuring last days of pregnancy, she was available whenever I call, even at night. Without any epidural or induction, I delivered normally only because of her. She gave very good moral support and encouragement. Even when I myself asked for epidural, she did not give it to reduce the chances of c-section. She advised us not to go against nature and to trust the body. Thanks mam for that.\n\nPost-delivery, she gave many tips on sitting postures, feeding baby and how to avoid abdomen belt - in India, only few doctors do this. She visited us often to ensure that I and baby are doing good. She monitored my thyroid levels closely and I was able to stop thyroid medications only because of her.\n\nThank you mam.",

Through out my pregnancy i had complications but Dr.Namita handled it so well that it even made us confident. She is very honest and ethical. She will listen to you with a lot of patience...she won't make you go through unnecessary tests..she always has that personal touch and you feel like you're talking to a family member.\n\nAll thanks to ma'am i had a normal delivery and delivered a healthy boy. I would 200% recommend Dr.Namita.\n\nThank you Ma'am  !!!",

She was always available on mobile which was very helpful when the due date is near. I would highly recommend her.\nActually I was consulting another doctor throughout my pregnancy and she referred me to consult Dr Namitha as my due date is in a week and she was going on a vacation. I was little nervous initially as she is not the one whom I was consulting from the beginning. But after I met her I felt assured. Whole thing went so smooth and am very thankful to Dr Namitha and her team. \nAlso, Columbia Asia Hospital service and their staff are too good. I am happy for choosing it. ",

Having an expert doctor who I could trust completely helped me carry it through. Just like in the first pregnancy, she continued to have thorough consultations, and kept issues like my gestational diabetes in control. She is very proactive and helped avoid further issues.\u00a0 Dr Namita is truly an expert at her work. She was a key factor in my being able to have smooth pregnancies at the ages of 42 and 44. Highly recommend her ! Thank you Dr Namita.",

Doctor was late by 1 hour.\n2.After she arrived in hospital, she just completed formality of looking after the patient.\n3.she checked my wife in HURRY.and prescribed something\n4.No friendliness observed.\n5.Tone of talking was somewhat rude.Even by hearing her ,you will fear asking some health related doubts\n6. No proper consultation given.It last for only 2 mins max .\n7. For 2 mins ,fees charged is 600 RS.which is not at all worth.\n8.She has prescribed one test.For getting opinion on the test report you need to pay extra,this was weired,usually it will included in the visit.\n9.overall experience is BELOW GOOD level.\n10.Will not recommend this doctor to our friends and family",

She was always very approachable, and we trusted her completely during the entire pregnancy and delivery... We always had a long list of queries in each appointment and she used to patiently answer us everything...I felt safe and happy just with her guidance . I had a long labour, but she never lost hope on normal delivery and her motivating and pleasing words helped me sail through it. Despite the complications, I delivered a healthy baby girl through normal delivery (with epidural). We will always be grateful to Dr Namita and we strongly recommend her.",

Dr. Namita was the driving force who not only used to make me feel comfortable but also listened to all my queries  very patiently. She  gave great tips to deal with the prenatal problems. \n\nShe is very particular about the scans and other reports reliability and also recommends  good specialists. \n\nThe best part is that she recommends very less medicines and motivates to go more for physical activities.\n\nShe was always approachable on calls and messages and would respond as early as possible.\n\nShe has been very caring through out this 9 months .I remember her coming down to the hospital at 1:00 a.m. during my delivery  as I was getting very nervous. \n\nAt last she handed me my little world the next day.\nIf you want everything about your pregnancy to be explained clearly , Dr.Namita is the person to be contacted.\n",

At a time of delivery, she waited 15 hours for normal delivery but at the last moment the baby heart was decreasing so she didn't want to take the risk and finally ended up in c section and I blessed with a baby boy.\nThroughout this 9 months, she was very caring, approachable even at any time.\nI would highly recommend her for all. \nThank you, Mam.\n\nRegards,\nVeena Singh\n",

From 32 weeks to 39weeks my journey with her was so amazing and she guided us very well. Never did unnecessary test and never told us go for C-section. Doc waited for normal delivery but my baby was on sitting position. so we decided to go for C-section. My 1st gal also borned by CS.  She is so friendly and very polite. After delivery Doc  always visited to our room to make sure all things are going well. we are so greatful Doc Namita.Thank you is a very small word. from Ranjan and Subhasree and Vanshika and Baby Vritika",

Thanks for the friendly and professional care.I was pleased and surprised to learn during the exam that she had taken the time to review prior test results to better advise and treat me. She made me feel comfortable and was also very easy to talk to.\nShe spent so much time with me and really listened. Did not feel rushed and felt like she heard my concerns. And her suggestions have helped me since. I could never thank her for her kindness and professionalism at a time I really needed it.She explained her answers to every question that I asked and made sure that we were on the same page. I left feeling relieved and confident that I was in good hands. I would definitely recommend her!",

We heard about Dr Namita from my brother but Colombia Asia was far from my house. We decided to atleast meet her once before we finally decide on Doctor.  Today we are happy to make that decision.\n\nWhat we found good about this doctor is her good and calm behaviour. I believe, for a Gynaecologists it is key to be a good listener. And this is indeed a quality in her.She is very systematic in her work and always puts a smiling face. She avoids unnecessary scans and hospital trips.She shared her number and asked to call or whatsapp whenever we need her assistance. We called almost 10 times within the last 3 months and she answered(on call\\whatsapp) all the time even when she was on vacation. We are happy with the care she shows to patiant.\nThank you Madam",
