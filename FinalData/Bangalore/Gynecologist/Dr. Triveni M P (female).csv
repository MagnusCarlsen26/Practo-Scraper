"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Hi,

We started consulting the Dr. Triveni for pregnancy related topics from June 2016 and in Aug 2016 my wife Shubha and got conceived. It was confirmed that we will be having twin babies and finally blessed with 2 cute boys on March 06, 2017.

Care taken by the doctor during critical situations of pregnancy.

1. During 02nd month she had severe bleeding and admitted to the hospital. The doctor came immediately and checked the babies and my wife and managed so that the bleeding got stopped and all were fine.
2. During 03rd month had cervical stitches which was early detected by the doctor during regular check ups. The time and the way doctor took the decision is really appreciable because with the twin babies it would have been very difficult and due to this miscarriage was prevented.
3. Almost at the end of 06th month, had severe early contraction pains at midnight and got admitted to the hospital again. Doctor managed and took utmost care so that the delivery is postponed.

Along with these critical conditions , she had diabetics & hypertension which was also taken care completely.
 
Finally my wife completed 8 months (36 weeks) and got delivered twin boys.

All the family members are really happy and very much convinced with the doctors treatment / care / managing during critical conditions and the way of responding.

For those who are planning to consult this doctor, we strongly recommend to have the consultations. She will be taking care of the patients with care and patience.

Thank you very much Dr Triveni for all your care, support during my wife's pregnancy and giving us the 2 cute little boys :)",2017-06-21 15:33:27,False,True,Pavan R D,,,

Hi Everyone,

This might take little longer time to read, however its worth if you want a real information about the experience we had.

We started visiting her last October 2018, we tried all other options for pregnancy. My wife was Having PCOD, it was difficult for us. We got to know about PCOD when we met Dr. Triveni. Initially we were hesitant to start the process explained by her. However, we wanted to be positive and had a long conversation with her about this. 

She ensured everything will be fine. We started the process in the month of Oct and in the month of December my wife conceived. There after we went on regular check ups without any misses and followed all the prescription given by her.  From day 1 she has taken good care of my wife and during every check up she has provided ample information about the baby's growth and condition( All scans including blood,Sugar, Urine and Anomaly). Every single issues related to baby was handled with ease by her. Finally we went to our native after 7 months of check up and during that phase also she gave us information what all are needed and what need to be done in 8th and 9th month. Finally on 30th July we had a baby boy born( Normal Delivery- CMC Vellore). 

Finally I want to say about Dr. Triveni is that she is one of the best doctors we have seen in recent times. She carries more than 13 years in this Industry and she is humble all the time you visit. She asks every single questions and remembers each and every conversation with every patient who is visiting her regularly. Though the tablets and few Injection might seems little expensive but for problems we had it was the best. Don't be hesitant in meeting her. She knows what she is prescribing . Have a faith on her.

I will highly recommend her to everyone who is reading this and I have already recommended it to few of my friends.

Keep up the good work Dr. Triveni. Thank you for taking care of my Wife. We really are grateful for everything you have done.

She will make you understand what's happening in every stage of pregnancy and give enough information and advice and clear all our ambiguities by time.

Right from the beginning, we are in touch base with her and I strongly recommend to others for anything related to gynaecology.

She prescribes medicine and scanning and other treatments as and when it's needed. Only if it's needed she will recommend to go for the tests/scanning. And even the consultation fee is also reasonable.

At times, she gives quick response on call or text even she is busy with other consultations. Her response to our urgency is highly appreciable even in her busy schedule. Hats off Dr.

It's amazing to know, we have this kind of good doctors around. 

Thank you so much for all the care and support you have been providing us throughout our journey of pregnancy.

On behalf of my wife Priya Myself Sudip
We recommend Dr. Triveni ** *** ** *** ***** *** ***** ****** * *** **** ** i meet plenty of doctor through india & now a day most of them are commercial.
Below are the few thing which diffentiate Dr. Triveni
from others
1.She has a patience to listen to your problem that may increase the waiting time of next patent but it is good for all.
2.She will explain you everythying in common language not in medical terminology.

3.And I believe she has a solution for all pregnancy related issue.
4.Last  but not least she will recommend u the test which is required only & not for commercial purpose.
So we recommend 100% to Dr. Triveni & I belive in future we will see Dr. Triveni * ***** *** **** ************ ** **********
