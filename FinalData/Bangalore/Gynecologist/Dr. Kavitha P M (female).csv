"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"I went to Cloudnine as it was near to my place and went randomly as I wasn't sure about pregnancy. On calling Cloudnine Jayanagar branch I was given appointment with Dr. Kavitha PM , I checked couple of positive reviews and met this Doctor and got to know that I am pregnant. Initially she was very positive and friendly and assisted me as I had extreme nausea. Eventually whenever I would ask the doctor about the probability of normal delivery I was not given any positive answer and told that we will tell you when you need to get admitted as I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes which was very mild and controlled after I was referred to the specialist who monitored my case closely and told that it is controlled and I need not worry . I had my growth scan during 32nd week where I was told that baby's weight is less and I might have to do another scan soon, deliver early and keep the baby in NICU. I was extremely worried hearing this as I am quite healthy otherwise and baby's activity in womb was also good.
