,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Manjula Gaekwad is treating my mother for endometrial cancer and she has always come across as very sensitive and empathetic. She puts her patient's comfort and concerns first. She took us into confidence by giving clear picture of the situation and the detailed treatment plan. The doctor has helped us to avoid many visits in the initial diagnostic phase by providing support on phone!
She did a radical hysterectomy last week and took care to make it painless for my mother given her old age. My mother is already healing very well and we completely trust Dr. Manjula to cure her of cancer. ",2024-04-19 08:04:38,False,True,Bhavya Srikanth Rao,,,
,,0,0,YES,"The doctor did a Hysterectomy for my wife. 18 years back she also did the caesarian for my daughter. We were getting confusion signals on what to do, when to do it, invasive or invasive, etc.

The doctor gave full clarity upfront and we went with the procedureâ€”speedy recovery, and very satisfied.

Dr Gaekwad is very compassionate, and friendly, has lots of patience, is transparent, very good in her domain.
