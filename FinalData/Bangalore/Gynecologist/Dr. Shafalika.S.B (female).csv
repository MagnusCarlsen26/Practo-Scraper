"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Fibroids Removal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Shafalika SB is one of the kindest and most empathetic doctors I have ever come across (and coming from a family of doctors, that says a lot!). She is an expert in laparoscopic gynaecological surgeries and her skill and competence ensures successful minimally invasive surgery resulting in greatly reduced recovery timelines.  

I first start consulting Dr Shafalika at Manipal (then Columbia Asia), Yeshwanthpur in 2019. I had heavy and painful periods + gastro problems triggered by periods. The scan confirmed the presence of multiple fibroids as well as adenomyosis (thick uterine lining). 

Although Dr Shafalika is a surgeon, she will never advise surgery as the first course of treatment and only when absolutely necessary. Dr.  told me I will eventually have to be operated but did not want to operate then. She broke the news to me with extreme kindness and compassion and put me on oral medications to try and suppress symptoms. The oral meds worked for some time but after a few months, I started getting severe migraines. I had moved to the other end of Bangalore by then and did not meet the doctor for my follow up appointment which was due in Feb 2020 due to work related travel. After that, the pandemic started and my visit was delayed greatly (due to my over-indexation on Covid).

I went back to meet the doctor after getting severe period cramps and gastritis in Jan, 2022. Again, she answered all my queries with patience and grace and did not rush me towards surgery although we both knew that was inevitable. When I was mentally ready, I went back and got my surgery done by her in June 2022. She ensured I was comfortable and as I didn’t have insurance, she did her best to reduce the cost of the procedure. It was a complex surgery but Dr. Shafalika was very confident that she would be able to handle it laparoscopically (and she did)!

On the day of the procedure, she arrived early and held my hand throughout the administration of general anaesthesia. She also reassured me wrt to the queries and concerns I had. During surgery, it was determined that I also had a bad case of endometriosis. At the hands of a lesser skilled surgeon, there was every possibility that my surgery would shift to an “open” one. But Dr. Shafalika managed to conduct the same laparoscopically.  

While at the hospital, I saw how well respected she was among her colleagues at Manipal (and deservedly so). She even came to meet me on a Sunday, the day after my operation!

My post-surgical follow up with the doctor has been equally pleasant and efficient. In the follow up meeting, she again spent a fair amount of time with me and addressed all my queries. There is always a long queue of patients outside her office (some from out of town), but she never rushes you. It is easy for a doctor to become clinical as this is routine work for them, but Dr. Shafalika knows that while she has many patients; for the patient, she is the only doctor! 

I developed a UTI infection post surgery and the doctor has been helping me address that very efficiently through telephonic consultation via her assistant, Nimisha. Nimisha is also a very kind and helpful person and enables access to Dr. Shafalika as needed. This is super helpful as I live 2.5 hours away.

I have been so impressed with Dr. Shafalika’s work ethic as well as care and concern for her patients, that I have recommended her to my neighbour who is evaluating similar surgery. 

I no longer have to plan my life around my menstrual cycle. And am so glad I met Dr. Shafalika and got the procedure done in her able hands and care. Thank you doctor! You are a beacon of compassion and competence – a very rare combination indeed.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Painful Periods,Heavy Periods,Adenomyosis Treatment,Endometriosis,Dysmenorrhea Treatment,",0,0,YES,"#longreviewalertI was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriotic cyst in my left ovary along with adenomyosis in the uterus about 3 years ago. Started off with medication that didn’t help at all. I had severe Dysmenorrhea and would take 5-6 pain killers per menstrual cycle. I tried to get pregnant but that didn’t happen too. My symptoms grew worse. It started affecting my daily quality of life. For the next 1 year I kept running from doctor to doctor trying to get a solution to my problem and plan a way for me to get pregnant. After running from pillar to post and after 1 failed laparoscopy surgery by another doctor (owing to the fact that my case was very complicated) I had almost reached a dead end, just then through sheer luck I was referred to Dr. Shafalika SB. I was all the way in abroad back then. That first telephonic call with her changed my very life. Given the fact that I had met so many doctors by then, I had never come across a doctor like her ever before. The way she spoke to me over the call, calmed me down like a mother would and empathized and acknowledged the suffering that I was going through was enough to take half of my anxiety away. The confidence that she spoke with, clearly explained me all the details and the steps ahead; She had a clear plan of treatment for me.

She is an incredible person besides being a highly experienced doctor!The surgery was scheduled in April. I had too many apprehensions in my mind due to a failed laparoscopy surgery that I had undergone a few months ago (in abroad). After meeting Dr. Shafalika in person, she clearly took me through the entire condition once again, clearly explained the steps of the procedure and told me the possible outcomes of the procedure. My surgery was extremely complicated one as I had a frozen pelvis (the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, rectum were all plastered to the uterus, the adenomyosis had spread to the entire uterus, the uterus had reached 20 weeks size). It was going to be a challenge and highly risky to separate the organs from one another and then remove the cysts. I was well informed about everything. With a doctor with such a foresight and confidence, I took the leap of faith. Inside the OT, as soon as I saw her, my anxiety disappeared. She held my hand, smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m there with you. I’ll try my best”. And with that I drifted into a sweet sleep.They say prayers have immense strength in them. 4 hours later, Dr. Shafalika came out victorious, smiling and in content with the success of the surgery. She was literally god sent! What seemed highly risky and complicated in the beginning was a success now. Dr. Shafalika was able to successfully remove the endometriotic cyst along with the adenomyosis despite the various complications. Having such experience and expertise, you can close your eyes and trust her. Here I am, writing this review because I want every woman out there like me to be able to get help. I shall forever be indebted to her.Dr. Shafalika SB is a gem of a person, highly experienced gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon specializing in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery and one of the best doctors that I have ever come across.

She tried her best to counsel, coach, understand, empathize, treat me.
I moved to Australia in 2018 and every time i came back to Bangalore i went to her for my health checkup.
This time as things were not looking great i was suggested with hysterectomy, she took care of me like a family member and i have never been so comfortable post my previous procedures. Dr. shafalika has done an absolutely wonderful job of cleaning the whole thing properly so i don't have any future issues.
My husband and family members are ever grateful for giving me this new healthy life.
The surgery was very complicated but she stood her ground and did everything that was good for me.
I thank her and all the hospital staff for taking care of me, this includes the customer service team (Aisha and team), the team involved in my surgery, Dr Dayanand the radiologist who has been studying my case for years now,  the nurses who assisted with pre operation tests and the staff who took care of me operation - please note i would be ever grateful for the rest of my life.

She tried her best to counsel, coach, understand, empathize, treat me.
I moved to Australia in 2018 and every time i came back to Bangalore i went to her for my health checkup.
This time as things were not looking great i was suggested with hysterectomy, she took care of me like a family member and i have never been so comfortable post my previous procedures. Dr. shafalika has done an absolutely wonderful job of cleaning the whole thing properly so i don't have any future issues.
My husband and family members are ever grateful for giving me this new healthy life.
The surgery was very complicated but she stood her ground and did everything that was good for me.
I thank her and all the hospital staff for taking care of me, this includes the customer service team (Aisha and team), the team involved in my surgery, Dr Dayanand the radiologist who has been studying my case for years now,  the nurses who assisted with pre operation tests and the staff who took care of me operation - please note i would be ever grateful for the rest of my life.

The best part was the quick recovery. My mom could walk on the same day of surgery and she was discharged the very next day at noon. And everyone at home was surprised to see her walk freely. She in fact was doing the basic house chores on the very best day of the surgery. The doctor had instilled very high confidence in her that she felt she had already recovered fully.Finally, I'm sure many laproscopic surgeons might perform similar surgeries.

I was very nervous due to this as I am still young and yet to conceive a child. Three of the experienced gynaecologist which I consulted at different hospitals suggested to go with conventional method of myomectomy which is the only way to deal with such large fibroids and without the surgery, it's impossible to conceive as there was hardly any space left for a baby in the uterus. We consulted to Dr Shafalika after watching a video of her speaking about uterine fibroids and it's treatment through laparoscopic way. She is very much caring and affectionate like a mother. She assured me while holding my hand to be completely fine after thoroughly explaining the case. We went ahead with a laparoscopic myomectomy and 3 larger fibroids weighed around 1.9kg got removed.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Ovarian Cyst Removal,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr Shafalika a few months ago, as I had sharp, unexplained pains in my abdomen. After checking my ultrasound, she found that I had a large ovarian cyst. She explained that the size of the cyst could be causing ovarian torsion and that might explain the pain I was experiencing. She recommended exercise and dietary changes in order to manage the pain, and prescribed a painkiller in case the pain was unbearable. She advised me to monitor the situation for some time, and if the pain did not improve or the cyst grew, she would surgically remove the cyst.

The doctor was very patient and kind during the whole process. I appreciated that she explained the health issue in both medical terms and layperson's terms to ensure that I understood what was going on. She was also very receptive to questions that I had.

A couple of weeks after the initial visit, the pain from the cyst was preventing me from going to work, so I visited Dr Shafalika again and we scheduled a laparoscopic cyst removal. I was very nervous before the surgery, as I have not had surgery aside from this procedure. Dr Shafalika's confidence in her ability and reassurance helped me calm my nerves and feel prepared for the cyst removal. She was with me and my family through the whole process, including  getting a room assignment after the surgery for me to recover overnight.

The surgery was performed without complications, despite the fact that a second large cyst that did not show up on the ultrasound also had to be removed. My incisions from the laparoscopic surgery are also healing nicely, and Dr Shafalika ensured that personally in a checkup appointment after the surgery. She was also able to give me lifestyle related advice to help prevent more cysts from forming in the future.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Uterine Fibroids,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Shafalika performed abdominal hysterectomy for me ten days back to get rid of my huge fibroids. Myomectomy was not possible due to the size of the fibroids. I had fibroids for quite some time, but they were mostly asymptomatic, which made me believe that I could just live with them and prevent them from growing further by adopting proper diet and exercise along with natural remedies. In retrospect, this was a great mistake! The doctor whom I had consulted two years back (following a routine health check-up) had advised immediate hysterectomy but did not explain the consequences of leaving them untreated.  Though the fibroids were asymptomatic, in two years they had increased in size to obstruct the ureters and prevent complete draining of urine from the kidneys posing risk to kidneys (which was revealed in a routine health check-up again). 

Getting back to the procedure performed by Dr. Shafalika, I completely concur with all the good words and praise showered upon her by fellow patients. She is very friendly and a very good communicator. She took me into complete confidence and promised recovery sufficient to resume routine work within ten days. I would go to the extent of saying that she over-delivers on her promises!! I was discharged from the hospital the day after the surgery, raising eyebrows of everyone around me. My recovery has been phenomenal and I'm all set to get back to work tomorrow.  The only restriction is on lifting weights heavier than 6 kg for 6 weeks. The doctor adopts minimally invasive techniques even in abdominal surgery that render such results. If only I had consulted her two years back, I probably could have saved my uterus (but I understand there is the risk of fibroids growing back). 

My suggestion to other patients: Do not neglect your fibroids. Take the effort to seek doctors specializing in minimally invasive treatment. ",2018-01-21 02:38:10,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
