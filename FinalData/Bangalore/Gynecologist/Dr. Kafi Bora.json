That is where we found Dr Kafi Bora in Practo, we were bit dicy when we visited her 1st time as this is totally a new horizon of experience for young parents (Woruld be :) yuppyyy). In the 1st visit She ensured that she answered all our queries considering we were first time anxious parents (when ofcourse your wife ask you so many questions make you realize why haven't you done MBBS) \nOne of the smoothest Journeys we had from April 16 till Jan 17 and I am always thankful to Dr Kafi for all the family friend like attitude, soft spokenness, patience, understanding nature, personal care/touch for my wife and baby. During the pregnancy and regular checkups, she monitored the baby and mother very closely. She also ask to call any time if need help which is rare, in between the pregnancy we had to travel for few days and instead of us calling her she use to call us and get reports settled. \nAfter months of regular check-ups finally when the time arrived we were very scared to opt between normal delivery or C-section (Really when my wife is so scared of even injections and this is a new life entering a new world). She really helped us understand the pros and cons of both types of delivery. We opted for normal delivery via induced labour (Were waiting almost for Whole night till next day afternoon) but it didn't workout for us and we decided to go for c sec as advised by her. For me I was so nervous about the c sec procedure and as soon as I saw my wife entering the delivery room, I started feeling cold & nervous. She made me understand that I need not worry everything is going to fine. \nAfter all this drama :), we were blessed with healthy baby boy. Thanks a lot Doctor for all those smiles on our face, Any one should not have any doubt in mind or second thought to visit her.    \n",
