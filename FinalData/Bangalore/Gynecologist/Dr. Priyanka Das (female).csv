"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Gynae Problems,Maternal Care/ Checkup,Pregnancy Tests,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Priyanka happened to be godsend person for us! We began interacting with her around 2-3 years ago for gynaecology related treatment. It was taken care and remedied by doctor swiftly and effectively. Post this, we started consulting her for our intention to plan for children. Considering the fact that we were married for about 8 years, and  still longing to have children. It was so emphathetic of her to encourage us to primarily try natural conception (which  certainly is not the case with other physicians, atleast with our experience of vast  and innumerable consultations elsewhere!).  With her frequent guidance and effective prescriptions, it proved to be miraculously possible.  When we had to take her intervention to finally make it happen, by  god's grace it was in maiden session alone! Now  we're blessed with bundle of joy, forever we'll be extremely greatful to Dr. Priyanka!
