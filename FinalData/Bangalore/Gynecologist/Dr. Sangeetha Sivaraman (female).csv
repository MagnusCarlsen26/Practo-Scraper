None,None,0,0,YES,"I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Sangeetha who has been my gynecologist since the time i conceived.

From the first day of my visit till my delivery and even after during the follow up visits, we had an amazing experience with her by our side. She has gone over and beyond to ensure all our queries regarding pregnancy, lactation, breastfeeding are resolved by guiding us from time to time.

She is quite transparent and ensures 2 way communication, listening and understanding my issues and expectations and then providing solutions.

Even in the labour room, when i was under extreme pain, she constantly motivated me and allowed me to be myself during that difficuilt hour which speaks highly of a her as a doctor with human values.

She is not only an excellent doctor, she is superb, approachable even at the odd hours, has a friendly approach who takes care of her patients with always a smiling gesture.

I can't thank her enough for the excellent care and guidance she has provided at each stage of my pregnancy journey but i am blessed to have her as my doctor.

I will always go back to her whenever i would need any gyne support in future and would highly recommend her to all my friends and family.",2024-07-16 07:29:59,False,True,Neha,,,
