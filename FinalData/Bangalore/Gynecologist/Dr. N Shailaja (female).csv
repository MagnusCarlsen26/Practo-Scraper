Once pregnancy got confirmed, for all my prenatal checkups, I continued there. She fills a lot of confidence in patient, and is excellent. Minimal but best suppliments were given. Diet was adviced to make pregnancy smooth. It is hard to find such doctors.

 I had small csp in my anamoly scan. I was scared. She explained things so well and thankfully all was fine by the time of repeat scan. Doctor directly came to clinic after coming from hospital just as we were waiting, though it was a festival day. The environment in the clinic itself is positive.

Initially I did not feel the doctor much friendly but later when I got covid, and was scared, in this situation as well she adviced some vitamins and said, be confident, and that words were so promising and she filled that strength to fight covid, being a friend. 

She suggested prenatal yoga, which also played a major role in my pregnancy. 

Thanks to all the care and strength given to me by you mam.

I would say, unfortunately I had to shift my hospital as I had to shift to my parents place considering this is my first pregnancy and could not continue here for delivery. But there can be no other concern for you once you approach her.

I would surely recommend her to everyone.. Also if I would plan a second one, sure I would go only to her. You are in safe hands if you have visited here.

"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"A doctor with a healing touch, confidence imparting approach and soothing smile. I had visited her from the 6th month of my second pregnancy of recommendation of my neighbour nurse at the rainbow hospital. (I regret for not having known about her in my first pregnancy and earlier of second pregnancy).Being used to regular check ups with innumerable machines in gyneac hospitals, I was startled by her expertise to know the baby development without a machine. Just one scan towards end weeks and regular fetal heart rate check. Minimal medication and tests prescribed. Emphasis on diet and exercise only. During labour, with a touch she knew whether I had contractions and she was spot on. After a hectic day, she was still at the hospital until 4 am to welcome our angel to this world safe. I was amazed to see her concentration and care during the last few moments of my delivery. my post delivery recovery too was quick.hardly a week while I suffered for a month due to the stitches in my first pregnancy elsewhere. I do recommend her and request every visitor to place ur trust in her and can with confidence say she will stay by it.

Now about the few comments on wait time and related... Pregnancy is not a defined treatment unlike other diseases. Few moments can change all plans unexpectedly. You will realise the importance of being given preference when u r in pain or have uncertainty of the well being of self and the foetus. At such points, u wish others let u go and meet the doc first. After my delivery, she would have reached home only by 5am on a Sunday and she was back at the hospital by 10 am to visit me again. In 5hours, kindly think of how much sleep and rest she would have received, how much of her personal life she did  get.

Doctors who dedicate themselves like her for the well being deserve much support and appreciation from the society. If ppl donot want to spare a thought about them, plz don't hurt them..it's a social and moral responsibility to stand by them...

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,Yes,"Having had my 1st delivery in an easy and friendly environment in UK, I wanted a similar experience here. After reading reviews about lot of doctors online, thanks to Practo's recommendation and all 5 star feedback, that I decided to try Dr. Shailaja once during my 2nd pregnancy. That's it! 
After my 1st meeting with her, it was no looking back and no more doctor hunts. She was just perfect in every sense. 
Normally we are v anxious on visits to doctors these days. Here I was, looking forward for my next appointments. I could share everything with the doctor, be it a concern, a trivial question or a detailed medico technical discussion. She is v practical and not even once restricted me from travelling, flying, driving (till full term), eating or any other physical activity. ( mine being  no risk pregnancy) 
The best thing about her is her cool and calmness even if there is emergency situation or if things  are not going in the right direction.  This positive  friendly attitude itself  will turn things around and gives strength and confidence for patients. 
She is extremely knowledgeable and up to date with latest research, being the gold medallist she is. 

I thank Dr. Shailaja from the bottom of my heart for making my pregnancy and delivery an enjoyable journey  and wish many ladies benefit from her in the years to come.  ",2017-05-29 17:06:59,False,True,Deepthi Hegde,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"********* *******  full of positive vibrations. 
I had spotting in the initial days of pregnancy and was very scared all the time whether the pregnancy would continue or not. Everytime I ran to her in fear and doubt she or her assistant Dr Gayathri would handle me very patiently and fill me with hope.
Once when I had bleeding in pregnancy I went running to her. She was heading to the labor room. She advised scan. By the time she came out it was past her duty time in the hospital. She could have just headed home and asked me to see her in the clinic.Yet  after the labor duty she directly walked into the scanning room to check my status. 
She constantly had advised me to stay positive and active and was more eager than me for a normal delivery. Even though my AFI was low she stayed confident and helped me deliver my baby normally.
I have seen many patients going into the consultation room tensed or crying and walk out beaming. That’s the power of her positivity. It’s infectious and fills the patient with hope and energy.
Many people have complained here about waiting time in her clinic but they have to understand the nature of her profession. Its full of unexpected emergencies. Her profession is such that she many not get a full night’s sleep at a stretch. I have seen her keep her family waiting because she had to attend to patients first.

My number was at 5th, they started sending patients to the doctor's room, they sent 8-9 patients, then I questioned mine appointment is at 5th, why you are not allowing me to meet doctor. One lady told me doctor is busy in other cases, they think your case is not important. Then that lady said before going to doctor I need to tell her about patient history records and all, it was just to convince me, she only asked patient name, age etc, it was just for name sake. It was 4.40 PM and we were told we still need to wait since there are few more important cases. They behave like this is the only place where we can go for consult in Bangalore, no value for others’ time, unprofessional behaviour. We left the place without consulting.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Family Planning,Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,NO,"I am not satisfied with the hospital behavior.
Doctor was friendly and supportive in explaining the process and health issues. She asked me to get two tests done, without unnecessarily making the list long. I visited her on Sunday and they have a follow up of policy of 5 days. I got my reports on Wednesday and booked a follow up appointment with her for Friday at morning 8:30 am. They re-scheduled the appointment on the same day for 10:30 due to some emergency at their end. I am a working person and it was not possible for me to visit the doctor at 10:30 am as I had an important meeting which couldn't be cancelled/ postponed at the end moment. So I requested the staff to please connect me to the doctor over the call at the same time, as it was only a follow up visit and I just wanted her opinion on my reports but they denied. Had there been some issue with the report, I would have taken another appointment to visit her. I do not understand what is the harm of connecting the patient with the doctor over the call at the re-scheduled time, when it is simply a follow up visit and that discussion would hardly take 5 minutes. But they did not agree, they said we don't do that. I requested and told them that they are the one who re-scheduled the appointment at the end moment, then they said they will check with the doctor and get back to me, which they didn't. I have been following up regularly with them but they are just not ready to connect me with the doctor. 
My follow up time is also expired and now why shall I pay Rs 600 again to just get my reports checked, which was a part of the follow up process, which they re-scheduled at the end moment and then even after so much of request, didn't connect me to the doctor. I am still calling them, but they are just not supportive and helpful.
I want to go ahead with the doctor for my treatment as she, in person, is a good doctor in explaining health issues but if this is how the hospital behavior is, I would definitely not go ahead with it.

Doctor stayed back in the hospital in the night , waited patiently and delivered the baby at 2am.
