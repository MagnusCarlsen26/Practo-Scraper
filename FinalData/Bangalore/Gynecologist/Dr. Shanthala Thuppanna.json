She counseled me very well before the surgery explaining the process options and risks. She gave me the confidence to go ahead with the surgery. She and her excellent surgical team did a fantastic job and the post recovery was so smooth that it surprised me. I could walk in a few hours after surgery and went home after 48 hours. She told me what to follow after surgery and was very confident and explained everything in details which helps to take decisions and set expectations. Highly recommend her for any gynecology issue. I trust her and the team at Sakra to do an excellent job and the best care in Bangalore. ",

She saved my 77 year old grandmother from a fibroid/tumor. Almost no doctor wanted to perform a hysterectomy on a geriatric patient, but she was confident from day 1. The way she handles her patient and visitors, the way she explains things, has a human touch. All women suffering from related issues must make a visit to her.",

We got to know about Dr Shanthala through my sister's friend, in the very first visit doctor gave me a whole picture of what the surgery was all about, expense,insurance coverage,stay in the hospital, post surgery care. This made me feel well prepared for the surgery. We decided to get it operated in few weeks time and its been a month now and Im glad I went to Dr Shantala, everything went very smooth and her team made me feel very comfortable. Along with the good experience she had  the way she took me through the whole process was amazing. Thank you once again for taking care of me so well.",

Things were going fine until recently when my doctor told me that my endometriosis has increased in size and advised me to go for a total hysterectomy through an open surgery. She completely ruled out the option of laparoscopy. Since it was a complex surgery, we decided to go for a second opinion. After reading positive reviews about Dr. Shanthala Thuppanna, we approached her at Sakra World Hospital.  She was confident that the surgery could be performed laparoscopically and only in a complex scenario would she do an open surgery. She answered all my queries patiently and we decided to go with her. Her coordinator ensured the entire process from hospitalisation to discharge was smooth.  My surgery (Total hysterectomy + Bilateral Salpingo Oopherectomy) was done laparoscopically which made me little relaxed and my post surgery issues were also very well taken care of by her dedicated team of doctors and nurses before I was discharged. The hospital staff was also very cooperative and helpful.\n I am extremely thankful to Dr Shanthala Thuppanna and her team for my treatment and would highly recommend her for her expertise and genuineness.",

She is one of the very few Laparoscopic surgeons available in Bangalore, maybe India. She knows her job. Talks to the point and is genuinely a very -very good doctor. She saved my 77 year old grandmother from a fibroid/tumor. Almost no doctor wanted to perform a hysterectomy on a geriatric patient, but she was confident from day 1. The way she handles her patient and visitors, the way she explains things, has a human touch. All women suffering from related issues must make a visit to her.",

Things were going fine until recently when my doctor told me that my endometriosis has increased in size and advised me to go for a total hysterectomy through an open surgery. She completely ruled out the option of laparoscopy. Since it was a complex surgery, we decided to go for a second opinion. After reading positive reviews about Dr. Shanthala Thuppanna, we approached her at Sakra World Hospital.  She was confident that the surgery could be performed laparoscopically and only in a complex scenario would she do an open surgery. She answered all my queries patiently and we decided to go with her. Her coordinator ensured the entire process from hospitalisation to discharge was smooth.  My surgery (Total hysterectomy + Bilateral Salpingo Oopherectomy) was done laparoscopically which made me little relaxed and my post surgery issues were also very well taken care of by her dedicated team of doctors and nurses before I was discharged. The hospital staff was also very cooperative and helpful.\n I am extremely thankful to Dr Shanthala Thuppanna and her team for my treatment and would highly recommend her for her expertise and genuineness.",

We kept faith on her and proceeded for surgery . Surgery went on well and in between she contacted cardiologist,radiologist .we stayed in hospital for 3 days.Lastly i have to thank Dr.Shantala mam's  assistant Dr.Uma Maheshwari which she helped us very lot regarding medications etc.\nSeriously believe me my mother is not facing any pain and she is very happy so we too.\nWe are very thankful to Dr.Shantala Tuppanna.*** ****** **** *** ***** ********* **** ********* ****** ******* ** ***********",

Being a Laparoscopic Surgeon, Dr. Shanthala appeared very confident about doing it laparoscopically. While others suggested hormone injections to bring down the size of the uterus, Dr. Shanthala did not suggest anything of that sort. She spent considerable amount of time during my OP visits to explain the treatment options and why those do not suit me. Things were smooth during surgery and post-surgery. Dr. Shanthala has been available to clarify my questions during the recovery period. Because of Dr. Shanthala, I could avoid doing abdominal hysterectomy when laparoscopic hysterectomy was very much a possibility.",

Instead of giving me the time , she forced the test before I was ready , was talking very loudly and said that i need to hurry up with the test as she has more patients to see. This shows that she had absolutely no empathy nor patience. The main quality that is needed for a doctor that too a Gynaecologist is to put the patient at ease , give comfort & confidence. Not cause extreme pain, tension & stress. \n\nConsultation Fees also is exorbitantly high. When you are charging so much. at-least try to connect with the patient and respect what they are feeling/ going through too. *** *** ******** ****** *** ******* Can be more sensitive next time.",
