No matter what time we reached out to her, she always made sure to answer. We underwent IUI and she explained everything in detail and with such an ease, that we never felt any hesitation. She was always around. And the best part, she was always upfront about everything, which was refreshing and reassuring.\n\nHer treatment made us proud parents of a beautiful baby boy. I do owe it to her for all her efforts and patience. She has been nothing short of a miracle for us. \n\nThank you ma'am for everything you did for us and thank you for being there with us, throughout the journey. ",
