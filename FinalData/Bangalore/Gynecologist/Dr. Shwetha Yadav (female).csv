None,None,0,0,YES,"It has been a very pleasant experience consulting Dr. Shwetha. Visiting her for my wife's second pregnancy (7wks at the moment of this post). Had not so pleasant experience at a different doctor a week ago when she tested positive for pregnancy & hence we decided to visit change the doctor. We narrowed down to Dr.Shwetha based on proximity to our place & more importantly based on the feedback in Practo. We absolutely concur with the positive feedback that others have given. 

She took time in getting the complete history of first pregnancy, delivery, medical history & current medical condition. She patiently went through every specific aspect related to pregnancy & made notes...never gave us a feeling that she wanted to quickly get over & move on to the next patient...instead she encouraged us to speak out, provide details & ask questions...she asked us to continue the existing tablets until we finish them before switching on to her prescribed tablets...this was so pleasing to see that she did not undermine the good suggestions from the prior doctor or overrule them just for the sake of it...so unlike the current breed of commercial doctors - pardon me for saying that.

While we will go back to Hyderabad for delivery as that's our hometown, we instantly made up the decision that she will be our doctor as long as we are here in Bangalore...we both strongly recommend her & would like to thank both Practo & it's users for leading us to her.",2017-07-15 16:31:27,False,True,Sujan Prasad M,,,
