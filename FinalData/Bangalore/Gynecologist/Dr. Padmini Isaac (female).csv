Best part, unlike other money minded doctors, she prefers Normal Delivery and waits for appropriate time.

She doesn't write unnecessary test which now a days became a trend and sometimes it becomes very heavy to pockets and not everybody can afford those tests.

St. Marthas Hospital is highly recommendable because its connected with nature and have big rooms and washrooms , you will have an access to Corridor for walking.
