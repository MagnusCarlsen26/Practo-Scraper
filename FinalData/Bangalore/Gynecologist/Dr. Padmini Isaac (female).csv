"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Bleeding During Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"I would never recommend this doctor to anybody. first of all cloudnine being such big hospital should have a token system or a proper queue system. even after taking prior appointment they made us wait for more than one hour. After such a long wait, the doctor was least bothered to explain the issue. She was in such  haste and no empathy at all. Please do not consult her. Instead of Explaining what the issue was she just wrapped up and proceeded with the next patient saying I will explain in the next visit. Waiting for one hour, and got consulted for hardly five minutes. please do not go consult her. Myself  and my husband were very disappointed. ",2021-09-02 16:57:32,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"I consulted Dr. Padmini Issac, as I heard that she was the highly experienced doctor in Cloud Nine. It was my first pregnancy. She was not at all friendly...gave least importance to my questions...was always im a haste. *** ***** *** **** ** ******* *** **** ******* ********* She also never bothered to give us any pregnancy related tips. My scan went normal during my 6th week pregnancy. But during my 9th week scan, growth stopped & heartbeat was not detected...I suffered a missed miscarraige. She took least importance to explain me what went wrong. 
She did not give any guidance after my miscarraige. I would never ever recomment her to anyone in future.

I now regret for consulting her ",2021-01-22 06:57:30,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
