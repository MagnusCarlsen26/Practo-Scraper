She supported a lot during the delivery 

We had a slight complication during the labor.

At this current scenario, where most of the experienced doctors doesn't want to take any risk & straight away end up doing C sections, she decided not to do a caesarean & preferred for normal delivery.

She monitored for almost 12 hrs with correct medications, after all the tense moments &  struggle, she was successful in a normal delivery.
