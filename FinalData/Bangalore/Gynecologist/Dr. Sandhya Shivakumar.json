Throughout my pregnancy, she guided me with care and expertise. When the time came, she performed a C-section, and I delivered a healthy baby boy.\n\nDr. Sandhya Shivakumar is an amazing, friendly, and down-to-earth doctor.

After a critical experience with my first pregnancy, where I tragically lost my baby due to negligence at a previous hospital, I was determined to find a good doctor for my second pregnancy. Dr. Chaitra recommended Dr. Sandhya Shivakumar, and from the moment I met her, I felt reassured.\n\nI shared my past pregnancy history and concerns with her, and she listened attentively to every detail. Throughout my pregnancy, she guided me with care and expertise. When the time came, she performed a C-section, and I delivered a healthy baby boy.\n\nDr. Sandhya Shivakumar is an amazing, friendly, and down-to-earth doctor. I highly recommend her to anyone seeking excellent prenatal care.\n\nThank you so much, Ma'am, for your care and concern towards me and my baby.\n\nWith lots of love and respect to you...",
