She has such a positive aura around her which I felt every day I visited her and her smile comforts you that everything is going to be fine. Unlike other big doctors, she will be available 24/7 on text messages and wtsapp in case you have any issues ,you can reach out to her and she is very prompt in her response .I was lucky to have chosen her for my pregnancy and I can say it was my bestest decision. I fall short of words telling about her but definitely I suggest all the pregnant women to consult Dr. Madhulika to make their pregnancy a beautiful experience!!My birth story goes like this-\nI was admitted on 19th March and had pains whole night and in the morning while I was not able to take the pain around 9 am we called the doctor and requested her for C-section but  she completely denied that and kept motivating me instead for normal delivery  even though me and my husband begged her so much. She was firm that I will be able to deliver normal in 30 to 45 minutes and the same happened. Even if I say 1000 times thanks to her also it is less. I will always be very very grateful to her and she is the most amazing gynecologist I have ever met!!\n",

She had listened to all our queries and concerns with  patience and had clear and satisfying answers for each. She was swift in replying to my email queries as well, which was very helpful. \nThe doctor was keen in making the delivery a natural birth, even if it meant overdue by a few days as long as the baby's health remained fine. The delivery was normal as wished for and during the labour the doctor was with me throughout, providing all support. Overall we had a very good experience with the doctor and would definitely recommend her.",

We found her very straight forward , providing us the perfect guidance and medical advice at various stages.\n\nBest thing is that she made pregnancy feel extremely normal with no unnecessary hype/ fear. The experience during labor was especially commendable.  She helped strive for a normal delivery- though I had to be induced and eventually ended in a csection... Doctor made every attempt to deliver normally . An example was during the labor- the duty doctor checked and found miconium in the amniotic fluid and hinted that we will need an emergency c-section and called Doctor Modhulika - she calmly asked to wait and keep monitoring baby vitals. \n\nAnother thing about her is that she is always positive, calm and one always comes out happy post consultation.

She has such a positive aura around her which I felt every day I visited her and her smile comforts you that everything is going to be fine. Unlike other big doctors, she will be available 24/7 on text messages and wtsapp in case you have any issues ,you can reach out to her and she is very prompt in her response .I was lucky to have chosen her for my pregnancy and I can say it was my bestest decision. I fall short of words telling about her but definitely I suggest all the pregnant women to consult Dr. Madhulika to make their pregnancy a beautiful experience!!My birth story goes like this-\nI was admitted on 19th March and had pains whole night and in the morning while I was not able to take the pain around 9 am we called the doctor and requested her for C-section but  she completely denied that and kept motivating me instead for normal delivery  even though me and my husband begged her so much. She was firm that I will be able to deliver normal in 30 to 45 minutes and the same happened. Even if I say 1000 times thanks to her also it is less. I will always be very very grateful to her and she is the most amazing gynecologist I have ever met!!\n",

We were looking out for a Gynaecologist with whom we can get fairly easy appointment without wairing for days. \nAs expected, Dr Modhulika was always available, whenever we wanted. She had listened to all our queries and concerns with  patience and had clear and satisfying answers for each. She was swift in replying to my email queries as well, which was very helpful. \nThe doctor was keen in making the delivery a natural birth, even if it meant overdue by a few days as long as the baby's health remained fine. The delivery was normal as wished for and during the labour the doctor was with me throughout, providing all support. Overall we had a very good experience with the doctor and would definitely recommend her.",

We found her very straight forward , providing us the perfect guidance and medical advice at various stages.\n\nBest thing is that she made pregnancy feel extremely normal with no unnecessary hype/ fear. The experience during labor was especially commendable.  She helped strive for a normal delivery- though I had to be induced and eventually ended in a csection... Doctor made every attempt to deliver normally . An example was during the labor- the duty doctor checked and found miconium in the amniotic fluid and hinted that we will need an emergency c-section and called Doctor Modhulika - she calmly asked to wait and keep monitoring baby vitals. \n\nAnother thing about her is that she is always positive, calm and one always comes out happy post consultation. Would definitely recommend her to everyone who are expecting ..\n",

Extremely happy to have chosen her for my delivery. \nShe delivered my baby boy through csect (dilation wasn't enough and water had already broken) although she will push u for normal delivery unlike other doctors. In the OT i kinda panicked seeing all the surgical instruments, dr held my hand and struck a conversation calmed me down, gave me words of encouragement. The other docs explain and prepared me mentally telling me what I will feel while inserting syringes etc.\nShe made my first pregnancy a very memorable one and I definitely recommend her.\n",

When I shared my age related worry, she told me 35 is normal these days since women are career oriented and like to embrace motherhood in 30s.  Also that it is not a magical number post which our health starts declining and problems suddenly crop up, it is more a factor of overall fitness and lifestyle. I felt a lot more confident hearing this and she also suggested taking some tests and scans before planning which I did. \n\nI would prepare lots of questions before every consultation and she would patiently answer them. She was always available on mails for any additional questions/ concerns or advise. Throughout my pregnancy she gave me a lot of positive vibes. While discussing my delivery options, she clearly laid out the pros and cons keeping my medical history in mind, let us decide and supported our decision. \n\nI was very nervous on the delivery table but when I saw Dr. Modhulika and her ever smiling and confident face, I felt comfortable that I was in great hands. I delivered a healthy baby boy and thanks to Dr. Modhulika for a wonderful experience overall. \n\nI highly recommend her.",

I was very much scared of whether I can get pregnant with PCOD or not that time Dr. Modhulika madam guided me, she explained me what PCOD is and it is possible to get pregnant with this problem. She suggested me to lose weight, within 6 months I got pregnant and whole journey of pregnancy she guided me so well and we trusted her 100 percent and as a result I delivered normally a healthy baby boy. One more thing I need to share that my EDD was 30 july but I delivered after 30th july. Dr. Modhulika told me to wait for some days 3 to 4 days more and 2nd was told she will go for induce pain. 2nd only my water got break naturally and pain started naturally without inducing pain . I got admitted same day at night that time Dr. Modhulika was left for the day but she kept tracking what was happening with team.I was in very much pain and every hour Dr. was checking me. House keeping stuffs and sisters also so good they cleaned each stuffs every hour. I was in pain near about 18 hours and Dr. Modhulika and her team did not gave up for normal delivery, they tried till last and finally it happened. I really want to say Thanks to my Dr. madam and her team and all the member of Cloud Nine who supported through out this journey. ",

I donot think I would personally recommend anyone for Cloud9 as a hospital in general for the simplest reason that I believe they fail at professionalism which they try to portray through various calls and sms-es etc. It is so because after their repeated calls (almost to the level of irritation) to reach for the appointment on time, when I reached at sharp 11:15am for a 11:20am appointment, I had to still wait for 1hrs 30mins for my turn to visit the doctor ! A 5-10mins wait, or even 15mins for that matter it understood, but 1.5hrs !!! Utter disappointment in this regard.",

After getting it they asked us to wait for 10mins and then after getting frustrated we stood outside her gate and after following up for another 15mins, she finally helped us out\nService is very poor and doctor doesn't respect one or feelings of the patient.",

The Doctor is so positive and supportive that the aspiring parents should always feel rejoice with the developments within. Her 18 yrs of experience are not just the count, it's experience of \"wor s t, bad and good\" situations. She pined the right treatment at right time to come over to bad situation. As everybody plans to have normal delivery, we also planed and shared with Dr Modhulika. She waits till the last moment until she recognises any critical situation. Fortunalty we never faced any ccomplications thx to God. Dr Charisma, her assistance at night in labour room, has helped us alot along with 3 supporting nurses. And we delivered a healthy baby normally ! it was great to visiting her. I would recommend to visit Cloud 9 old airport road Bangalore, I am sure they have more gems to help us. all the best. ",
