Dear Shobha ma’am,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for your extraordinary care and support throughout my pregnancy journey. Your unwavering dedication, expertise, and compassion have truly made all the difference in bringing my precious bundle of joy into this world.

From the very beginning, you instilled confidence in me and encouraged me to aim for a normal vaginal delivery. Your motivation and reassurance helped me overcome my fears and anxieties, empowering me to embrace the birthing process with courage and optimism. Your commitment to promoting natural childbirth and your belief in my ability to achieve it were incredibly motivating and reassuring.

Throughout the prenatal visits, you patiently addressed all my concerns and provided invaluable guidance, ensuring that I felt informed and empowered every step of the way. Your gentle demeanor and genuine care created a supportive environment where I felt safe and confident in your expertise.

When the big day finally arrived, I felt a sense of calm and confidence knowing that you were by my side. Your expert guidance and encouragement during labor were instrumental in helping me navigate through the challenges and ultimately achieve a successful vaginal delivery. I will forever be grateful for your skillful hands and reassuring presence during one of the most pivotal moments of my life.

Thanks to your exceptional care, I welcomed a healthy baby into the world, and for that, I am eternally grateful. Your dedication to your profession and your patients is truly commendable, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have had you as my gynecologist.

Once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you have done for me and my little one. Your impact on our lives will never be forgotten.

Delivery at 6 months is advised in certain cases where continuation of pregnancy is going to endager life of mother or baby.If mother & baby are in  good condition maximum effort is taken to prevent preterm delivery.

6 months fetus weighing 560 gms has a poor survival rate in the best of the centres.I don't think anyone would say 'be positive' in that context.

Many times we need to do certain tests( some are expensive& some are not expensive) to know the cause of  pregnancy problems ,so that if possible  problems can be prevented in subsequent pregnancy .
We offer the tests,but patients have the CHOICE to do.

Many  pts understand their problems  explained by the doctor & remain optimistic to do necessary  tests hoping for better outcome

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"We are staying in Kadugodi, Bengaluru & hence were visiting nearby Cloudnine Clinic in Whitefield for my wife's regular pregnancy checkups. 

When my wife was nine months due, I got a shocker of my life when the doctor I was visiting, out of blue moon, mentioned that she will not be available for my wife's delivery as she is going to her native for Diwali vacation. I was really anxious & upset to hear that. If she could have hinted the same before then I would have time to find another good doctor but at this late stage I really don't know when my wife could go into her labor pains. 

Nevertheless, after I returned from the clinic, I took up the daunting task of finding another doctor who could be much at least caring & of course an expert. After a day of search and speaking with my colleagues & friends, I decided to visit Dr. Shobha Venkat at Cloudnine hospital in ORR. Without wasting anytime, I booked an appointment with her the very next day.

On the appointment day, both of us were little anxious as we were not sure if doctor would be available & more importantly would accept taking forward my wife pregnancy at such late stage. With this apprehension, we both went into the doctor's chamber.

Dr. Shobha Venkat was extremely welcoming. My first impression of her was she is a nice, calm, well poised, well behaved and extremely welcoming doctor. She not only gave us confidence of her availability during the pregnancy but also calmed both us. I found her an expert and the one who knows her work very well. After I came out of the visit, both of us were extremely happy that finally we found the right doctor. There was no other doubts thereafter.

As my baby was little more on weight & my wife started showing tendency of sugar inclination, Dr Shobha advised us to go ahead with the delivery a week before my wife's due date. On the planned date, doctor tried their best to help my wife to deliver naturally but things were not moving as expected. Then again Dr. Shobha's expert decision to  go ahead with c-sec came handy. I din't give any second thought and decided to go with her decision as I had already built enough of trust on her. 

My wife delivered on 18th November 2015 with a healthy baby boy. Both my wife & baby were fine and back from OT within 2 hours of post operation observation. Cloudnine provided a unique experience for expected father to be inside the OT and experience this unique new phase.

Post delivery, I got a call from Dr. Shobha. She congratulated with her usual warm welcoming voice. It was really nice to hear her as I couldn't meet her post delivery. She also informed me that it was the best decision to go with c-sec as the chord connecting the mother to the baby had started wrapping around my baby's neck and because of that it was quite difficult for the natural delivery and hence the decision to go with c-sec was apt. I was really pleased of myself by trusting Dr. Shobha & going with her decision without any second thought.

I really had a very nice & wonderful experience visiting Dr. Shobha. The only thing I regret now is not visiting her right at early stage of my wife's pregnancy. Nevertheless, I would like to give a big big thanks to her for her ever comforting voice, her amazing expertise and ever welcoming nature. You are the best!!! Thank You!

I know it’s late, but better late than never! 

One of the people we as a family are grateful for is Dr.Shobha Venkat.
She was my gynecologist for both my babies.
I gave birth to my baby girl in 2018, who is going to be 5 years old in other 3 months. 
The journey throughout my pregnancy with my daughter was very smooth. I had no issues.

I gave birth to my son in Sep 2022, but it was very difficult, I had many health issues. 

There were times I was really stressed, worried and sometimes I used to think if I could deliver the baby safe.
But the moment I enter into her cabin and see her big smile, all my worries would just fade away.

Any Issue I tell her, she had a solution for that. 
From the first visit, throughout the Pregnancy the care given by Dr. Shobha Venkat has been phenomenal. 
She is an amazing woman, a wonderful human being.

But she always gives the credits to me saying that I managed it very well 🙂

Doctor, I hope this post reaches you.
You brightened up our lives with 2 beautiful children, We are a happy family now.

You really can't imagine the amount of respect we have for you. you've become one of the most important people in our lives.
Thank you! Thank you very much for all the care!

And I can't complete this post with out thanking your whole team of doctors nursers and the house keeping staff.
Especially Doctor Chethana for supporting in the delivery.
Nurse Sheebha, she took care of me during the labour
Nurse Anniyammal, She is a wonderful person, didn't hesitate even a bit to complete the procedures after the delivery.

My two cents to all those who are planning for a pregnancy or going through a pregnancy - Please have full faith in your doctor, follow their advise religiously, Do not keep changing the doctor frequently, and take everything as it comes.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Before getting conceived, my wife was having PCO and we had consulted this doctor. After following her medications within few weeks my wife was pregnant and we were very happy. From that moment we never had changed our hope and made sure that she is the one doing to do delivery for our baby. We had consulted doctor starting from 1st week itself, she is polite in answering questions, even some silly ones without getting irritated. She is very systematic and proper in steps, tells each and every point in a clear manner and writes everything so that we follow them up.

We are so lucky and happy that we had consulted with this doctor that too for our first baby. When the delivery time came my wife was too afraid to do normal delivery and she wasn't getting the pain even after 18 hours. She insisted on waiting and doing normally as it is good for both baby and mother. But finally, we ended up doing C-Section and got our cute boy out from the womb. Now he is 8 months old and filling our time and space with happiness around every minute. 

About the C-Section Procedure, first, it was just 5 - 10 mins, first is the injection for getting local anesthetic in the spine and then operation. I was quite surprised because before even I got dressed to go into the OT the procedure got over. It was comparatively less pain than normal but Post Operation she was having pain for one night. In one day itself was able to walk and the pain was also gone by 70%. By three weeks we were all back to normal.

Finally, I had a normal delivery of just 2.5 hours of labour and I delivered a healthy baby girl.  My two cents to all those who are planning for a pregnancy or going through a pregnancy - Please have full faith in your doctor, follow their advise religiously, Do not keep changing the doctor frequently, and take everything as it comes.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Before getting conceived, my wife was having PCO and we had consulted this doctor. After following her medications within few weeks my wife was pregnant and we were very happy. From that moment we never had changed our hope and made sure that she is the one doing to do delivery for our baby. We had consulted doctor starting from 1st week itself, she is polite in answering questions, even some silly ones without getting irritated. She is very systematic and proper in steps, tells each and every point in a clear manner and writes everything so that we follow them up.

We are so lucky and happy that we had consulted with this doctor that too for our first baby. When the delivery time came my wife was too afraid to do normal delivery and she wasn't getting the pain even after 18 hours. She insisted on waiting and doing normally as it is good for both baby and mother. But finally, we ended up doing C-Section and got our cute boy out from the womb. Now he is 8 months old and filling our time and space with happiness around every minute. 

About the C-Section Procedure, first, it was just 5 - 10 mins, first is the injection for getting local anesthetic in the spine and then operation. I was quite surprised because before even I got dressed to go into the OT the procedure got over. It was comparatively less pain than normal but Post Operation she was having pain for one night. In one day itself was able to walk and the pain was also gone by 70%. By three weeks we were all back to normal.

Initially we visited a different doctor on confirmation of pregnancy and they suggested supportive injections for entire first trimester and diet plans and weekly blood sugar tests,etc. It scared us at the beginning of the journey. Then we came to know about Dr.Shobha through our colleagues and we decided to visit her. As mentioned by so many others, mam always welcomes with warm smile and the first thing she mentioned to us was that Pregnancy is not a disease and we should enjoy the pregnancy. She reviewed the reports and assured they were not worrying. We felt that we were in good hands and relaxed. Mam always encouraged for normal delivery and we delivered our first baby vaginally under Dr.Shobha's supervision.

With this positive experience, we decided we would visit only Dr. Shobha in our successive pregnancy and we did so. In our second pregnancy, my blood sugar levels were borderline high but mam handled it in a very calm way and suggested to do portion control and continue the same diet instead of suggesting a completely different diet which makes it difficult to follow.  Also, mam always encourages to eat healthy food, example my iron levels were a little low and she suggested to supplement it in diet instead of resorting to iron injections immediately. Mam never suggested unnecessary tests/medicines. She encouraged us for normal delivery this time also and under her guidance, we were able to deliver our second baby also vaginally.

 We started our family planning in late 2017. I conceived in Dec 2017 but after 10 weeks also we couldn't hear baby's heartbeat and I had to go through miscarriage. After that same thing happened in Oct 2018. After second miscarriage in a year I was mentally broken. Becouse of 2 miscarriages Dr. shobha asked us to do some special reports. All reports were normal. Then doctor advice me reduce some weight and be happy and be mentally prepare before trying for 3rd time. I followed same. Waited for 6-7 months and during that time I excercised a lot and focused on healthy diet. After that we tried for 3rd time and everything worked out well and we blessed with baby boy in April.
What I like about Dr is she always welcomes patients with smile and say how my girl is doing. This gives positivity and strength to patients. Atleast for the people likeme who are staying away from family and gone through miscarriages in past. 
She was always reachable through call/what's app/sms for my any queries related health and later when lockdown got imposed due to corona virus. 
I had normal delivery, that to all thanks to Dr Shobha and her staff from cloud 9 hospital. I had given up and told her staff and her many times that I can't bear pain and please do c-section. But they always told me you can do it we all are with you. 
Some other doctors might have gone for C-section as soon as patient asks for it. But She was firm on her decision that till things are fine and she will not do C-section and she kept motivating me. 
She used to tell me make your mind and be strong, you will sail through your entire pregnancy journey and labour time easily. This is very important now a days as we all know that now C-section is not as painfull as it used to be before and we start giving up easily.

I delivered a healthy baby boy on may 3rd..I had difficulty during my delivery as I had to go through a lot of pain as I was induced with pain..

I was admitted on 2nd of may around 10:30 as advised by the doc..n I was induced with pain so that I would dilate n have a normal delivery..

I was induced with two gels at the interval of 5-6 hours gap..But the pain was unbearable..
Doc came around 5:30am as she had a delivery to be done n she came n met me..she gave me a hope n said that we will wait for me to dilate n go for normal delivery..

When the second gel was induced around 5am I couldn’t bear the pain as the time passed n I told my husband that I couldn’t take it anymore..he kept on telling me to bare it now so that later I need not suffer with c-section..the nurses were also very motivating and asked me to wait till 9:30 n doc will come again for a check..

As I couldn’t take the pain more n I was just 3cm dilated I lost hope n I couldn’t take it any more I said my husband that I will go for c-section.then I was given epidural so that I dilate n could go for normal..

One thing I liked the most about the doctors is that they explain everything before something is done.
After the epidural was given I was all fine n didn’t know about the pain..and around 11:30-12pm I got labor pains n was ready for the delivery.. 

They need not had to wait so long for the delivery to be done..But they made sure that I deliver normally n waited for so long..

All my relatives were shocked bz my baby was 3.4kg n delivered normally..

   Before that I had lost my 1st baby due to placenta abruption and we were planning for our next baby and don't want any unfortunate happen again so really worried for second time taking chance.  
Then  one of my friend suggested me to visit Dr. Shobha Venkat so I went to Dr. Shobha for preconception counselling. She gave us such a warm welcoming smile and listened my previous bad experience very calmly and told us to keep faith and positive attitude.She suggested me to do some blood tests and scan. Though all the reports were normal except fibroid. When I went back to her I was very worried becoz of scanning report. She smiled towards me and said don't worry about fibroid they are in outer layer of uterus and don't affect pregnancy. She didn't give me any medication and told me to follow healthy lifestyle and balanced diet, stay away from stressful environment and trust to god.
After six months I conceived naturally and completed my 9 month of wonderful motherhood journey under her supervision . Every visit and scan was a bit of anxiety and nervousness becoz of prev. bad experience but she always make us comfortable and made my journey very smooth. I religiously followed whatever she used to advise me.
After months of regular check ups finally time arrived and Dr. Shobha suggested us to opt C-Section becz of previous pregnancy history. Though I was not ready first but she made me understand that no need to worry about C-Section. She clearly explained that C-Section are now safer than compared to few years back becoz of improved techniques and medications. 
Finally we went for C -Section and delivered to a healthy baby girl. Many people are worried about C-Section but entire process was smooth,  post delivery care given by doctor and cloudnine hospital helped me to recover fast.
Thank you so much Mam for all your motivation , support and care whatever you done to us throughout my entire journey of pregnancy and delivery.

1st pregnancy was ectopic & thanks to ignorance of few junior doctors @Cloud9 (Old Airport Road), I was rushed to Manipal later again on an emergency. Shobha saved my life with minimal invasive surgery. I recouped well & waited for a year.

2nd pregnancy, I consulted Shobha at Bhargavi Clinic in Indiranagar & opted Manipal for delivery. Every visit & scan was a lot of anxiety because of previous bad experience but Shobha made the journey very comfortable with her advice.

The years of experience she has & the confidence she instills in us has been immensely helpful.

The bond between spouses, the doctor & family matter most in this beautiful journey. We were blessed to have good equation during this journey. The confidence & motivation that Shobha gave in the labor room mattered most. I did not open my eyes throughout labor, only went by voice of Shobha & that voice still echoes loud ☺.

Thank you Shobha for making our journey most rewarding & persisting with normal delivery right from the beginning.

I had two episodes of red degeneration pain during  fourth month and menstrusal cramp-like pain even after that. Dr. Shobha helped me through these pains by her emotional support and treatment.   

Although I had severe pain and chances of miscarriage in the first and second trimesters and preterm delivery in the last trimester due to the fibroids which grew in sizes during pregnancy, with her guidance, care, and treatment, I could complete the nine-months journey. Dr. tried her best to deliver the baby in a natural way, but my body did not respond to the process. So, an emergency C-section was done. Doctor took care even postpartum. 

Dr. had also guided me through mails and messages whenever I had any issues.

With a big baby, normal delivery did appear very hard at first (impossible actually), but with Doctor's positive approach, ever smiling face, constant encouragement, right practical advice on food and excerise, timely intervention and guidance I was able to deliver my child with ease. Dr. Shobha and her team of doctors and nurses at cloud nine old airport road hospital navigated me through my labor with at most positivity and care. They had a very clear plan on my delivery ahead of them and meticulously implemented every step. My delivery taught me that it's only complete trust on doctor - from both patient and their family side, and positive mind that does wonders along with medication.

We came to know about her from a local clinic. It was a very normal pregnancy initially for my wife and we usually visited her clinic(Bhargavi clinic in Indiranagar) for routine check-up. However, during 2nd trimester, there were some pregnancy complications which she handled in a much efficient manner. The EDD was somewhere 1st week of Nov 2015. But, couple of days before the EDD, my wife experienced the labour pain. I immediately took her to CloudNine hospital in Old Airport Road, it was around 11:30 PM in the night. The baby's BP showed fluctuating rapidly. Dr. Shobha Venkat was immediately contacted and updated about the status of the baby and mother. To my surprise, Dr. Shobha reached the hospital within minutes for the delivery of my wife...This was never expected by me that should would be available so late in the night for my wife's delivery. After the initial assessment, she advised that we must go with c-sec as the umbilical cord connecting the mother to the baby had started wrapping around baby's neck and because of that it was quite difficult for the natural delivery. Hence it was decided to go with c-sec. Within an hour(around 1:40 AM), we both were blessed with a baby boy.

We finally chose Dr. Shobha Venkat after lot of search and our decision proved to be very correct.
Dr. Shobha Venkat is a very nice doctor who has very long experience in this profession.
She gives lot of time to her patients and answer their all queries.
She took notice and cared of all the developments that kept happening throughout the trimester and monthly checkups like HyperTension, Gestational Diabetes, pains, cramps, edema etc.
My wife had HyperTension from the 6th week of pregnancy itself.
The HyperTension grew drastically during the last trimester which was handled very nicely by the medicines.
The continuous home monitoring of BP and sugar and maintaining a date wise chart was suggested by the Doctor to avoid frequent hospitalisation for observation.
This proved very helpful. This was closely followed and was brought in the doctor's notice during every appointment. 
The monitoring and controlling BP with medicine helped save lot of medical bills which could have incurred due to hospitalisation for hypertension during pregnancy.
During eighth month, situation became very critical when the HyperTension was staying near and above 140/90 continuously and chances of reaching full term was looking bleak.
The complications grew a lot in last two months but were handled very carefully by Doctor till last stage. The delivery was finally scheduled in 38th week.
When the chances were looking very bleak for normal delivery as BP was staying continuously very high, doctor showed extreme caution and went ahead with admission 2 days prior to delivery.
This was done to observe and manage medicines to assist in normal delivery which helped.

She is an amazing person, always smiling, very welcoming and ready to make your pregnancy a wonderful journey. 
She answered all my queries and ensured positivity at every stage.
Like everyone or maybe most of the women I too wanted a normal delivery to happen, because I wanted the body to do its job and I wanted to recover faster.
But, my baby’s head had not engaged even at 39 weeks.
Being my first pregnancy and the head not being engaged yet, Dr. Shobha advised a c-section. She said that there are almost nil chances of a normal delivery happening as the baby’s head was still mobile.
Since I was reluctant with it, she suggested I get induced for labour first and if nothing progresses I would have to undergo a c-section.
Coming from a medical background, we too knew that induction might not work if the head was not engaged but we just wanted to try. 
The induction did not work and I had no contractions at all. So the next morning I was taken in for c-section.
There are a lot of women who actually prefer c-sections to normal deliveries for the fact that there is no delivery pain involved.
Believe me, c-section was indeed a wonderful experience. The spinal anesthesia wasn’t painful as many think. Dr. Shobha made me feel so relaxed and everything was over in no time.

I am 39 years old and I am blessed with a baby boy this June 2019 and I can say this is a miracle happened to me. I got married in 2008 and became pregnant twice naturally but due to lack of growth it got aborted.
I have undergone so many treatments in Allopathy as well in Siddha *** ** ******** I have undergone 3 IVF’s and all got failed due to some or other reasons. Finally decided to stop the treatment for a year and concentrated on my health. Followed good diet with vegetables , fruits , millets , nuts , walking ,yoga , visits to many temples… Finally after an year of this diet and prayers, my periods was missed. With hope as well as anxiety when I tested for pregnancy by gods grace ,it gave positive result.
My friend suggested Dr. Shobha Venkat. Me and my husband met her with the result and she suggested for some tests to confirm. In the first meet itself we are happy by the short and sweet approach of her. In this journey , when we meet her everytime she had guided us properly. She will never tell to take unncecessary tests. When she is advicing she will explain the reason behind it so that we can understand it. I delivered my baby a month before and he is a preterm baby. For me ,fluid started leaking before a month of my due date .I was so much worried and rushed to the hospital. She had checked me and said nothing to worry. Surgery was done the next day and successfully she gave us our baby. We are sooooooo happy and lucky to have such a **** doctor in our life due to which my pregnancy ended with good result.

I have bulky uterus(with multiple fibroid), hypothyroid and Hb disease. One doctor gave me very expensive medicine (Around 140 Rs per tablet) which suppose to cure fibroid. It did not work for me, no change in the size. 6 months prior to my pregnancy I had a very bad experience with another certified doctor which made me feel whether or not I will conceive as i have these complications. I was depressed for a while.
But by gods grace I conceived normally and I was looking for a Doctor who can give me proper guidance. I did some searching in the internet and thats how I went to Dr. Shobha Venkat. It was a mixed feeling of happiness and fear when I first visited her. When I told Shobha mam about my problems she made me feel very comfortable with her beautiful smile, gave proper explanation to us and said nothing to be worried as I am pregnant now. 
After every scan I get worried because of the increasing size of the fibroids but Dr. Shobha will make me calm and stress free with her simple advice in every stages of pregnancy.
Followed her advice on diet which are very simple and medication for my low hemoglobin level and thyroid.
Whenever I had any issue or doubt I would text her and she always reply with her suggestion. Thanks a lot for that. I could be stress free and enjoy my pregnancy, felt like I am in safe hand.
When the due date approaches she educate me with all the symptoms of labor and built confidence in me. She waited for normal delivery but I did not get contractions naturally or through induction. Finally I had a c-section and delivered a healthy baby girl. Post delivery care given by Doctors and Clodnine hospital was great.

So Dr told me that one thing that can help me was loosing weight through proper and balanced diet (not crash diet )and exercising. She kept motivating me throughout. And with my effort to loose weight, I conceived. I didn't loose loads of weight but in PCOS that effort of loosing helps a lot. I was 107kgs when I conceived and Dr guided me through my pregnancy so that I don't gain much weight as I was already overweight but at the same time baby weight and growth is proper. With help of Dr Shobha, I had a healthy and normal pregnancy . And more importantly I delivered a 3kgs healthy baby at 38weeks and that too normally. With my weight, my family and myself were convinced I can't have a normal delivery but I did. Dr Shobha guided me to walk throughout my pregnancy and loads of it, because of which I was 95kgs immediately after delivery.  I learnt one thing from my experience, PCOS is not the end of the world, anybody can conceive with it but it needs dedication for how much ever time it takes, don't give up and Dr Shobha will take you through it.

Honestly we scared as it had to take daily and how to inject no idea.Doc advised us to take help of the medical practitioner nearby home for initial days then try for yourself. We followed  the same.

Especially the staff at the 1st floor were under impression that the patent knows everything.

Sticking to the appointment timings are important. 10-15 mins variance is acceptable but not an hour.

Billing counters  across floors or more number of counters will really reduce the wait time of the visitors.

Doctor was excellent

I don't prefer to revisit again to Cloud 9.
