However, the assistant to the doctor (dont know the name) on that very day of April 22nd, 2017, around 9:30-10 am was very very harsh and I'll mannered. She failed to manage the queue and behaved very badly to an extent that she said if you have an issue with your pregnancy you will have to wait for whole day long and what will I do then.

"Wait time,","Pregnancy Scan,",0,0,NO,"My appointment with Dr Shruti was for 11:45 AM on 6th Aug. I had a follow up appointment with another doctor planned in such a way that I could show the scan results to the next doctor. I had arrived at the doctors reception at 11:15 (half hour before appointment time) and informed the staff. But to my absolute dismay I was not called even after 10 mins after my appointment time. And when I checked with the staff at reception they were not willing to give any explanation other than to say there are 5-6 patients in the list. Finally I was called up 12:45 PM - one hour after the appointment time. And it’s not at all easy sitting in the uncomfortable waiting area benches with a pregnant wife. We missed the next doctors appointment due to this delay and had to stay back in the hospital till 4:30 in the evening to see the gynaecologist since she had gone for break. Over all a traumatic experience and I would strongly recommend people to stay away from the OAR Cloudnine. They don’t value people’s time and have very rude reception staff who treat patients with total disdain. Even when I demanded to speak to someone in charge of grievances they took half an hour to get someone to talk to me.  But no measures were taken to speeden up in the procedures. They simply don’t care about patients well being and I have already changed my future appointments. Will never think of coming back to this place which doesn’t treat customers with respect. 
The biggest joke was their phone customer service line. Someone picks up the phone and says everything will be alright and says they have limitations on helping us. So it’s better if you make some noise in the hospital itself. I’ve given up on this process. ",2019-08-05 11:06:34,False,False,Brijil Philip Mathew,,,
