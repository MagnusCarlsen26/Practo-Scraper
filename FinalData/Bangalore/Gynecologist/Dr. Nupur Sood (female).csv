"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Irregular Periods,",0,0,YES,"In 2017,I was under tremendous distress to handle my pcod and conceive. Fortunately, one meeting with Dr Nupur changed everything.1. She busted all myths and misconceptions I was fed by  friends, family and internet2. She listened to every action I was doing to handle pcod and conceive and helped me to course correct them3. She interacted as if she is talking to her younger sister and has been there always to support me morally since I met her till I deliver my baby and beyond. I conceived after 3 months which was not possible with the most celebrated Doctors with bloated prescriptions for an year. again, after 4 years, she facilitated my son's circumcision with the best doctor in her network which means a lot. I really recommend the doctor for any girl. ",2022-04-12 12:47:04,False,True,Ramya K R,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"She has a very warm, caring personality and made me feel very comfortable. I would like to express my thanks for her professionalism, understanding and the top class treatment I was given.
As frankly speaking, now a days having a normal delivery is a big task as other hospitals Strictly follow C-Sec. and most of the Doctors also suggest for C-sec. 
but I must say Dr. Nupur Sood is a perfect doctor for those patients who has a fear of C-sec. she tries her best for the normal delivery. 
In simple word I can say she is a lucky charm filled with positive nature. 

After the post delivery I had breathing problem as it doesn't not involve gynaecologist involvement. But still Dr.Nupur has taken all the initiative to guide me and she also visited me to know my Heath condition. And over the phone also she was asking about my recovery. No such doctors does this to any patients. 

I definitely recommend Dr. Nupur Sood.
