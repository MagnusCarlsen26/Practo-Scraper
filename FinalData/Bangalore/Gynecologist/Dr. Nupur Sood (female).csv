Fortunately, one meeting with Dr Nupur changed everything.1. She busted all myths and misconceptions I was fed by  friends, family and internet2.

She interacted as if she is talking to her younger sister and has been there always to support me morally since I met her till I deliver my baby and beyond. I conceived after 3 months which was not possible with the most celebrated Doctors with bloated prescriptions for an year. again, after 4 years, she facilitated my son's circumcision with the best doctor in her network which means a lot.

This all led to late pregnancy loss for me. Underwent a difficult procedure. 
Thankfully we had changed the gync and scan diagnostic center in 4th month.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Hysterosalpingogram,",0,0,NO,Though the doctor might be experienced and good at what she does but the basic empathy of attending a patient who is already scared and in pain is missing. She was extremely rude and was literally shouting which aggravated the pain. A doctor is supposed to be calm with patients and with the exorbitant money that is paid we expect proper care and treatment. I would definitely not want to visit or recommended the doctor to anyone. *This is my personal experience,2023-10-09 05:43:26,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
