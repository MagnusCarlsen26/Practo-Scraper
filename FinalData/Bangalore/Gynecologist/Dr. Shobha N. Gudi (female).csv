Recently I was suffering from post menopausal bleeding and I got to know that there were multiple cysts in the uterus through a scan. So I visited Dr.Shobha ma'am at St. Philomena's hospital. She found out the exact problem in the uterus by doing hysteroscopy. The cysts were removed and sent for biopsy testing and she found out that it was a benign stromal nodule which was the problem. So finally she performed hysterectomy on me and removed the uterus solving all my health problems. *** ** ** ****** *** ** ********* ****** *** *************. She took really good motherly care and motivated me warding off all my fear. She's a kind hearted and good human being.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"My experience has been really bad, I was seeing her from the 3rd month of my pregnancy, there are about 2 to 3 patients in the consultation room at one time, no individual attention given and my attenders have never been called inside.

I kept asking her if it is necessary for stiches to be put as my cervix was weak. But she never paid attention. I lost my baby.
