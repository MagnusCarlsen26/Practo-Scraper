None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"A good and experienced doctor whom we got to know via my mother's friend circles.
We always ensured to book the first available appointment at 6 PM and also made it on time always.
Since we knew her schedule, it was easy to plan. 
She is patient and would listen to our queries - we made sure to follow what the doc prescribed and not the traditions of our religion.
Dr. Sudhamathy always guides in the right direction during pregnancy and we are now blessed with a healthy baby.

At times, she did mention that if she isn't available at cloud9 we could meet her at clumax, but we always ensured that the plan didn't get to that :).

None,None,0,0,NO,"We have consulted Dr.Sudhamathy a few times for my wife's pregnancy. We have made the following observations:
1. She is impatient and is not at all interested in knowing what the patient wants to speak.
2. She always seems to be in a hurry, especially if you book an appointment towards the end of her visiting hours since there are other clinics/hospitals that she is associated with and wants to make money there as well.
3. I have seen her scolding the hospital reception staff in front of us. This does not look professional.

We have no personal rivalry against the doctor, but we have just shared what we genuinely felt, not just once, but after observing the doctor for a few visits. We pay so much for hardly 5 minutes of consultation. I feel we deserve to ask relevant questions and get them clarified.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"She is a very Quick doctor, she comes on time, she doesn't wait for anyone and she will not make others to wait for her.

Based on my lifestyle she has suggested to me a few things. Which I am supposed to follow. She will not stress you out with unnecessary explanations and she never compares with other patients. she tells every individual pregnancy is different. 

Very important is that she gives the minimal medication actually supplementary(calcium n iron) no extra drugs. This is not the case with many other doctors.

When you visit her you should be ready with your list of questions READY!

She is a very positive person, she never scared me for anything.
