Each and every previous report she checked in detailed. Full examination was done. Reason for failure was explained. She will never give false hopes and negativity. She will give explain eacha nd every step in detail. With great moral support from her we undersent one more IVF but I got very few eggs and only two embryo. Madam td us to do few blood test and few uterus test. Two months she told us to take break. As per advise we did everything. But we were little nervous for only two embryo. She did embryo transfer and everything went as per plan. I became pregnant. My pregnancy was high risk with high BP and high sugar. Every time she used to monitor and she used to reply to our doutds. Now I'm proud parent of twins. Very happy to share my good news and now we are celebrating one year birthday of my kids. Highly highly recommended to everyone.

Her approach to the treatment was very very clear and transparent. She will explain everything in detail. First attempt of IVF we conceived but at three months I had abortion and I was really depressed. \nBut madam gave full support and always she was replying to our messages . In second time I conceived but again I started having bleeding . Even though we stay very far she used to advice each and everything to me as well as our delivery doctor. Everything will be blessed at correct time this s her sentence. This my real experience with God grace I delivered baby of 3 kg one week back\n Very happy to meet Dr shilpa at correct time and glad I met her. Highly recommended for each and everyone . She spreads positive thoughts to everyone with her great smile. I'm speaking to her since one and half year and still she s same guiding us. Thank you sooooo much for treating me like ur family member",

Dr. Shilpa's diagnosis was spot on from very first visit. As a couple, we were made very comfortable which helped us discussing the problems openly. Dr. Shilpa is very friendly and very attentive. She ensured we don't lose hope. The way we were advised about the delivery procedure and the confidence induced by Dr. Shilpa is second to none. She always radiates positive energy and make sure her patients stay positive and strong. By following all her advices and treatment, i had a normal delivery in 2020, now we are proud parent of baby boy. I cant thanks her enough.\n\nWe will highly recommend Dr. Shilpa Gupta and thank her for helping us became a proud parent. We are sure you wont be disappointed and you will see 100% result.\n",

We met Dr shilpa through my friend. Within first consultation she became very close to us and she took two hour to explain everything in detail. Each and every previous report she checked in detailed. Full examination was done. Reason for failure was explained. She will never give false hopes and negativity. She will give explain eacha nd every step in detail. With great moral support from her we undersent one more IVF but I got very few eggs and only two embryo. Madam td us to do few blood test and few uterus test. Two months she told us to take break. As per advise we did everything. But we were little nervous for only two embryo. She did embryo transfer and everything went as per plan. I became pregnant. My pregnancy was high risk with high BP and high sugar. Every time she used to monitor and she used to reply to our doutds. Now I'm proud parent of twins. Very happy to share my good news and now we are celebrating one year birthday of my kids. Highly highly recommended to everyone. Very happy and satisfied with you madam. Thank you so much for everything.",

We left all the hope, then some acquaintance suggested Dr. Shilpa's name.\n\nWe started consulting Dr. Shilpa with the last hope in 2019 based on the feedback we saw in the internet and personal references . Dr. Shilpa's diagnosis was spot on from very first visit. As a couple, we were made very comfortable which helped us discussing the problems openly. Dr. Shilpa is very friendly and very attentive. She ensured we don't lose hope. The way we were advised about the delivery procedure and the confidence induced by Dr. Shilpa is second to none. She always radiates positive energy and make sure her patients stay positive and strong. By following all her advices and treatment, i had a normal delivery in 2020, now we are proud parent of baby boy. I cant thanks her enough.\n\nWe will highly recommend Dr. Shilpa Gupta and thank her for helping us became a proud parent. We are sure you wont be disappointed and you will see 100% result.\n",

Two years back I met Dr. Shilpa, she s the one who spends so much time with patients and she will explain everything in detail. Mam explained to us to go for one more cycle of IUI and it was negative. But somewhere I had a lot of hopes with mam treatment. Next cycle we underwent IVF and we preserved our embryos. Due to lockdown, we couldn't go for embryo transfer. Later we went for embryo transfer In August month. It went smoothly and I delivered a baby boy. All thanks to mam.\nShe gives full positive energy and all-time she will receive our call and she will reply. Happy to share my positive story",

She patiently answered our numerous questions, and thoroughly addressed all of our concerns. Never once making us feel rushed. Her attention and dedication was the same high level during all consultations. She made both my husband and myself extremely comfortable during a stressful situation.

We are surprised and not actually ready to conceive the baby at that moment. We then found Dr. Shilpa on practo and decided to visit her clinic after seeing +ve reviews on her profile. As we are running out of time, Dr. Shilpa suggested us to go for surgical abortion and explained us the  treatment process in detail. Doctor is so friendly, I have lots of doubts and she answered to all of them patiently. My surgery went well and it just took 15-25 mins, as I was given anesthesia, I am kept under observation for few hours.  I am satisfied with treatment and I didn't faced any difficulties like over bleeding or cramps during my long travel day. And post treatment after a month I approched Dr. Shilpa once again, as my monthly period didn't show up on time,I was little worried. But she said post abort, body takes time to develop harmones and nothing to worry about this. After 40 days of my surgery I got my menses and I am all good.  I suggest to visit this doctor for gynecological problems. ",
