We only started seeing her in the final month of pregnancy, but she quickly got up to date and prescribed steps to be followed in all aspects including diet, exercise to ensure a smooth delivery. During the delivery itself, She handled everything with calmness and skill, keeping us well informed every step of the way and taking my wife comfort and preferences in mind as much as possible. Thanks to her, my wife was able to deliver our precious, healthy daughter the natural way who has filled our life with joy. Even her team  did a great job, of course ably led by Dr. Nagaveni. We strongly believe that had we consulted Dr. Nagaveni from the beginning of the pregnancy, our experience would have been even smoother. She communicates very clearly and makes you comfortable with any asking any questions or doubts you may have. It was also very obvious that she makes it a point to keep up to date with all latest research in her field and uses all tools at her disposal to benefit of her patients. She is always quick to answer anytime you may need to call her and occasionally when is unable to calls back as soon as she is able to.  There is never any doubt that her patient's best interest is her priority.",

                "review_text": "Being new in Bangalore, I received Dr Nagaveni\u2019s reference from a neighbor. We had initially met her to take a 2nd opinion as I had faced a subchorionic hemorrhage in my 1st pregnancy.\n\nI have to mention that while Dr Nagaveni\u2019s reviews online are fabulous, she\u2019s even more amazing as a person! While I initially met her to take a 2nd opinion, she remembered the background we discussed on the phone and was equipped to take things forward from there. It didn\u2019t take us long to trust her 100%.\n\nWhen I encountered an early miscarriage in my 1st pregnancy, Dr Nagaveni stayed very practical when it came to her treatment and left no stone unturned in our journey to becoming parents. She advised only the relevant tests to be taken at the right time, suggested the right weight, exercise and lifestyle changes, etc for both my husband and I, before we conceived again.\n\nAs for the 2nd pregnancy, given that I had fibroids, she recommended a scan to assess their position and unlike most doctors, did not suggest surgical removal, as it was not necessary. While the initial trimester was challenging, Dr Nagaveni was instrumental in ensuring all scans and tests were carried out in a timely manner and even checked in periodically between visits to ensure everything was on track. Despite her busy schedule, there is not a single instance where she has not reverted to a message at the end of a busy day.\n\nDr Nagaveni also took the required precautions and monitored my BP and blood sugar especially during the last trimester when uterine/umbilical artery resistance values were high on scans. Through judicious monitoring, she ensured that this pregnancy was not unnecessarily classified as high risk, which honestly saved us from additional tests, visits, scans and stress.\n\nTill the end, she advocated a natural birth and shared the exercises, diet, etc to prepare for the same. However, on account of fetal distress, we needed a caesarean at the last moment. Even in the OT, she is extremely calm, confident and she and her team make the process seem like a breeze. She is a true expert at putting the patient at ease at this crucial time.\n\nDr Nagaveni has played a pivotal role in our journey to parenthood and we cannot imagine going through the same without her medical expertise, empathetic nature and positivity. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone looking at a highly professional gynecologist and an even better human being to guide them with their pregnancy/medical journey.",

This is my first pregnancy and from the beginning itself I consulted Dr. Nagaveni for all the monthly check-ups and followed all her instructions and diet. In the 6 month i had faced cervix issue due  to which I underwent cervical cerclage by her only and advised for complete bed rest. Finally with the help of doctor I had normal delivery which I didn't expect also. Thanks to the doctor for supporting me and encouraging me a lot from the starting and mainly during my labour.",

Throughout both pregnancies, she genuinely cared about me and strongly advocated a Normal Delivery for me.  Her experience and skills were evident in her consultations and delivery approach.  Even when she switched to Motherhood Hospital, I knew I had to follow her because the quality of care she provided was irreplaceable.

Thanks to her, my wife was able to deliver our precious, healthy daughter the natural way who has filled our life with joy. Even her team  did a great job, of course ably led by Dr. Nagaveni. We strongly believe that had we consulted Dr. Nagaveni from the beginning of the pregnancy, our experience would have been even smoother. She communicates very clearly and makes you comfortable with any asking any questions or doubts you may have. It was also very obvious that she makes it a point to keep up to date with all latest research in her field and uses all tools at her disposal to benefit of her patients. She is always quick to answer anytime you may need to call her and occasionally when is unable to calls back as soon as she is able to.  There is never any doubt that her patient's best interest is her priority.",

We had initially met her to take a 2nd opinion as I had faced a subchorionic hemorrhage in my 1st pregnancy.\n\nI have to mention that while Dr Nagaveni\u2019s reviews online are fabulous, she\u2019s even more amazing as a person! While I initially met her to take a 2nd opinion, she remembered the background we discussed on the phone and was equipped to take things forward from there. It didn\u2019t take us long to trust her 100%.\n\nWhen I encountered an early miscarriage in my 1st pregnancy, Dr Nagaveni stayed very practical when it came to her treatment and left no stone unturned in our journey to becoming parents. She advised only the relevant tests to be taken at the right time, suggested the right weight, exercise and lifestyle changes, etc for both my husband and I, before we conceived again.\n\nAs for the 2nd pregnancy, given that I had fibroids, she recommended a scan to assess their position and unlike most doctors, did not suggest surgical removal, as it was not necessary. While the initial trimester was challenging, Dr Nagaveni was instrumental in ensuring all scans and tests were carried out in a timely manner and even checked in periodically between visits to ensure everything was on track. Despite her busy schedule, there is not a single instance where she has not reverted to a message at the end of a busy day.\n\nDr Nagaveni also took the required precautions and monitored my BP and blood sugar especially during the last trimester when uterine/umbilical artery resistance values were high on scans. Through judicious monitoring, she ensured that this pregnancy was not unnecessarily classified as high risk, which honestly saved us from additional tests, visits, scans and stress.\n\nTill the end, she advocated a natural birth and shared the exercises, diet, etc to prepare for the same. However, on account of fetal distress, we needed a caesarean at the last moment. Even in the OT, she is extremely calm, confident and she and her team make the process seem like a breeze. She is a true expert at putting the patient at ease at this crucial time.\n\nDr Nagaveni has played a pivotal role in our journey to parenthood and we cannot imagine going through the same without her medical expertise, empathetic nature and positivity. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone looking at a highly professional gynecologist and an even better human being to guide them with their pregnancy/medical journey.",

In the 6 month i had faced cervix issue due  to which I underwent cervical cerclage by her only and advised for complete bed rest. Finally with the help of doctor I had normal delivery which I didn't expect also. Thanks to the doctor for supporting me and encouraging me a lot from the starting and mainly during my labour.",

From the moment we met her, she treated us with warmth and professionalism that immediately put us at ease. Her care extended beyond medical expertise; she took care of us like a family member, ensuring we felt supported and informed every step of the way.\n\nOne thing that stood out was her responsiveness. Dr. Nagaveni was always available to answer our calls and messages promptly, which was incredibly reassuring during such a pivotal time. Her ability to communicate clearly and compassionately helped alleviate any concerns we had, making the entire experience smoother and less stressful.\n\nDuring the delivery itself, Dr. Nagaveni's skill and expertise were evident. She handled everything with confidence and precision, ensuring both the health of my wife and the baby were her top priorities. Her calm demeanor and reassuring words were a source of comfort during labor.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Dr. Nagaveni highly enough. Her dedication to her patients is exemplary, and her caring approach sets a standard for healthcare professionals. If you're looking for a doctor who not only excels in her field but also genuinely cares for her patients, Dr. Nagaveni is the ideal choice.",

Even when she switched to Motherhood Hospital, I knew I had to follow her because the quality of care she provided was irreplaceable.

She has always been extra cautious with my wife as she had a couple of miscarriages prior to this. Finally on the D-day she delivered my first baby through normal delivery. I was pretty nervous about going into the labour room with my wife but the doctor ensured I got an opportunity to do so and got me in just a minute or two prior to the delivery. It was a precious feeling to hold the baby for the first time. My wife and I would forever be grateful to Dr. Nagaveni for this experience and would recommend her to all our friends and family.",

Her advice was always best of both traditional and modern practices. This was my 2nd pregnancy and first one was induced. We were concerned on why im not even into mild contractions and labor in last 1-2 weeks, she was reassuring us that everything is normal and never pushed for induction or any other intervention. She was crystal clear in explaining us the next steps and helped me in delivering healthy baby full term as normal delivery.\n\nI feel it\u2019s incredible feat for myself and I believe no-one other than Dr Nagaveni who could make me trust the process.\n\nRight from attending deliveries in the morning till midnight, she hustles between HRBR Motherhood and Disha Clinic. Inspite of such hectic worklife, Dr. Nagaveni\u2019s calm demeanor and empathetic support were invaluable. I wonder how she can manage her personal and professional life handling those many mothers to be and be such a composed person she is. From past 1 year, she never postponed our appointments and we never saw a grim face. On the day of labor she assured me that she will be available within half n hr anytime during the night and she was present by 8 00 AM at my delivery as promised.\n\nThis level of commitment, unwavering dedication and care makes Dr. Nagaveni one of the best Doctors in this profession and We highly recommend her to anyone seeking a gynecologist who truly puts their patients first.\n\nThank you Dr Nagaveni for all your support and care.

Her expertise and level of care instilled a confidence that we wouldn't have had otherwise.\n\nNow, holding our precious baby in our arms, the overwhelming feeling is one of pure joy, and we know it wouldn't be possible without her. She was instrumental in bringing our little miracle into our lives, and we are forever grateful for her dedication and compassion.\n\nThank you Nagaveni ma'am for being more than just a doctor. Thank you for being our champion, our guide, and a pillar of strength during this incredible time. We will cherish this experience and forever remember the role she played in it.",

Post reading all these positive feedback we decided to visit the doctor. I have made some really good decisions in my life but this one tops the list without any doubt . She is the best one could ask for. My wife was having some anxiety issues from earlier and thus finding a suitable doctor that can give her the confidence to smoothly go through this wonderful journey was our top priority and needless to say the doctor exceeded all our expectations . Since this was our first pregnancy we had a lot of queries  but she explained all of them beautifully with a smile . You name the traits you need in a doctor and she possesses all of them.*** ********* ** *** ****** ** ****** ** **** * My wife who was anxious about the delivery procedure and the associated pain put a lot of force on doing a cesarian as she did not want to go through the pain of a normal delivery . The doctor carefully analysed our case and in a world where doctors normally suggest cesarian delivery she convinced my wife to go for a normal delivery and even undertook measures to reduce the pain process and finally a normal delivery happened and everything was smooth. She is always available round the clock to help her patients , she kept regular rounds to check if everything was ok post pregnancy as well. Always suggesting what we can do if we have any bumps in our journey be it for my wife or the baby. She is a great professional and an even better human being , i wish her all the best and hope she gets a lot of happiness just like how she brings happiness to our lives\ud83d\ude0a",

For my pregnancy as well I wanted to continue consulting with her. She was extremely patient and friendly. As it was my first pregnancy I had a lot of questions and she patiently answered all my queries and in some instances provided reassurance by citing live examples. At one point my baby was not gaining weight and I was extremely worried but she helped fix the issue and reassured me. After every visit I would feel positive and happy. She guided me so well throughout my pregnancy journey that I would look forward to my routine check-ups. \nDuring labor I almost gave up and asked her to do a c-section. She convinced me and I ended up having a normal delivery. She was so tolerant throughout, despite my multiple requests to go for c-section. She was so pleasant and patient even then. She was so confident that I could do it and motivated me. Her confidence and positivity kept me going. She gave me options to ease my pain. She is so quick to give solutions and make things work, this speaks volumes of her work and dedication. Everytime my baby's heart rate dropped or if he didn't move down the birth canal, she knew what had to be done. Her quick response to each situation helped immensely. She was so calm and composed during the last phase of labor which led to a smooth delivery. \n\nShe was always one phone call/text away. She would respond immediately to any queries, no matter the time at which I would reach out. My respect and admiration for her has grown manifold from my first meeting with her. \n\nI would highly recommend her to anyone seeking a good gyneac/obstetrician in Bangalore. ",

However with heavy heart i started the scouting for the best Gynec near our place in Kalkare (Rammurthy Nagar) ... While Google gave us enough options we ended up with choosing Ms Nagaveni (Purely based on the Google ratings and some reviews) . My First visit was equally inquisitive and wanted to quiz the Doctor as much to understand if we are in the right place being a new parent and expecting our first lil one .... But she was patient and ever smiling to help us out not just during the first visit but throughout our paternity.... The way she guided us with Dos. Donts , what works with her other patients , what's the best case and every other silly questions we use to ask ... She infact was so approachable that even a night ping in WhatsApp during time of distress she was always there for us.. as days passed , we were nearing the delivery and my wife s only request was that Ms Nagaveni is with her during the delivery and nothing more .... Even when we theoretically know when to approach hospital for labour , the instinctive reaction in times of doubt is to immediately call our doctor and she was so kind to check on the situation and guide us on when to reach ... As my wife stepped into labour and I was at the peak of stress , the glance of Dr Nagaveni made us feel little at ease and she was around one way or other through out the delivery phase .... At one point the pain was such that we wanted to opt for a C section , but Dr Nagaveni was very calm and she had the art to convince and calm down my wife to get her through with normal delivery which I found it really strange in the age of current hospitals... My respect grew multifold for her at that point and I was super happy and proud that we had got the right and best doctor on board ... As promised and guided she helped us deliver a healthy baby and became a integral part of our life ... A simple thank you won't suffice for what she has helped us with .... A huge shout out to Dr Nagaveni and her entire delivery team in the hospital for their guidance and support .... ",

Since the beginning of pregnancy till the my baby's birth, the doctor was always warm and welcoming, creating a comfortable atmosphere.\n\nExpertise:\nDr. Nagaveni demonstrated a deep understanding of gynecological health. Her knowledge and experience were evident throughout the consultations. She took the time to thoroughly explain my wife's condition, answer all our questions, and discuss treatment options, making us feel confident in the care I was receiving.\n\nCompassion and Communication:\nOne of the standout qualities of Dr. Nagaveni is her exceptional level of compassion. She listened attentively to my concerns, showing empathy and understanding. The communication was clear, and I never felt rushed during the appointments. This made discussing sensitive topics much more comfortable.\nShe ensured a respetful and confidential environment always.\n\nFollow-up Care:\nAfter my wife's delivery, Dr. Nagaveni provided clear instructions for follow-up care and made herself available for any additional questions or concerns. This follow-up care was reassuring and demonstrated a commitment to ongoing patient well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend Dr. Nagaveni for anyone seeking expert and compassionate gynecological care. Her professionalism, expertise, and genuine concern for patients set her apart. I am grateful to have found such a dedicated healthcare professional.",

Her expertise in managing such situations while still aiming for a normal delivery was reassuring. I deeply appreciate her commitment in providing the best possible birthing experience, regardless of the circumstances,she diligently prepared me for normal delivery\u00a0 since seven months into the pregnancy by recommending exercises,Even on the day of delivery, with doubts looming as the baby's head remained unfixed until the last moment, Dr. Nagaveni's expertise and support ensured a successful normal delivery.",

Doctor asked us to come to clinic immediately, then after getting the scan done it was confirmed that there is no amniotic fluid leakage but my cervix has shortened . Doctor didn\u2019t panic us she told us to wait till a week , take complete bed rest and see . After a week cervix length didn\u2019t increase so she asked us to go for emergency cerclage operation , we were very  scared and stressed but she gave us confident explained us everything . Surgery was done and I was admitted in hospital for 5 days , I would say she took really right decison I realised later . This procedure is for 1 day and many doctor sent you home after 24 hours but she asked me to stay and actually it was for my good and for my baby becoz if I would have come to my home there would have been so many confusion panic situation and if some problem  would have come travelling to hospital would have worsen my situation I feel . After this I was in complete bed rest and doctor was always available through what\u2019s app message or call . Even in night she used to respond to my query . She was very considerate and thoughtful she didn\u2019t unnecessarily asked me to come to clinic or go for Scan until and unless if it is very necessary .  \nAfter 32 weeks my complications kept on increasing . My pregnancy journey became more challenging . But it  was doctor assuring voice and positive attitude which helped us kept going . I developed below complication 32 weeks onwards apart from the short cervix length issue which I was already having .\n1.Gestational Diabetics .\n2.  Severe Polyhydramnious \n3.Cholestasis of pregnancy \n4.Hypertension \n But doctor always with her smiling face , knowledge and positive attitude gave us hope that for every problem there is a solution . She helped us manage and monitor each and every thing . The best part is she is very calm and never panics you by telling big big medical terms and complications , she always focus on solution and explains the approach how we will deal with this complications. After 32 weeks I was having itching when I reported to doctor , doctor asked me to do a Blood test . But even before it showed in my report  she with her knowledge and analysis has confirmed that I have cholestasis of pregnancy and she asked to start on low dose of medicine and repeat the blood test after a week . And yes she was correct my bile acid and SGPt and Sgopt was increasing . After that she increased my dose and advice me to repeat the blood test twice a week and do scan once a week and keep a checks on baby movement . She helped manage GD with proper diet and medicine . She monitored my case very closely and always kept a eye on my Reports and everything . After this my platelet count also started decreasing after every week . Earlier she has told us that due to cholestasis and other complications we should be ready for delivery after completing 36 week and she told she will try for normal delivery .This was surprising for me that inspite of so many complications she is telling we can try for normal delivery . But as we know \u201cMan proposes and God disposes .\u201d Around 34 weeks 6 days my bile acid was increasing too much , and so many complications were already there . Doctor recommended us to go for c section at 35 week as it would be risk to wait more . We have full trust and confidence on Doctor so without giving any second thought I got admitted on 26.02.2023 and 27.02.2023 our baby girl arrived . Our \u201cbrave girl \u201c . As doctor has already taken precautions before hand and I was sterioded  so our baby was born healthy and breathing fresh air . But since I had severe amniotic fluid some water had gone in my baby lungs due to which my baby got admitted to Nicu for 48hours . But yes , again her instinct and analysis , recommendation proved to be right . If we would have delayed it would have caused more problems, more damage to my baby . \nWe are grateful to doctor entire team of motherhood hospital as well as Disha clinic staff . \n\u201cDoctor is very talented , prompt in her response , very proactive and prompt and takes right decision at right time , friendly , and she always remember each and every  even minute details of her patients complications , report  which is something so amazing and impressive. \u201c We highly recommend doctor , you can chose doctor for your pregnancy journey without giving any second thought . \nLast but not the least whenever we felt stressed and worried doctor always assured us that if you come till here be positive , everything will be fine . I can\u2019t even explain to what your reassuring voice meant ma\u2019am . \nIt was sai baba blessings that we chose her and are blessed with baby girl .\nOm sai ram .",

                "review_text": "It\u2019s the Sai baba blessing that I met Dr. Ngavaeni and my journey of second pregnancy started in the guidance of her. What struck to me about her was her patience of listening to patients and give them physical and moral gain.\n\nWhen I learnt that I had conceived, I decided to go to an renowned Doctor nearby. It was a Thursday. It\u2019s the direction of Sai that even having the appointment with that doctor, my appointment with the doctor was not listed. Looking at my age criticality and the past abortion and recent miscarriage with 6 months, I was more tensed about the pregnancy and wanted to consult doctor immediately. Suddenly on the way to my daughter\u2019s skating class, I saw the Disha clinic and recalled few of people recommended Dr Nagaveni. Immediately I called Disha clinic and took the appointment and met Dr Nagaveni.\nI had always wanted a doctor who was efficient and contemporary in her thought process at the same time. She is proficient in her field- provides a lot of time to her patients, efficient in diagnosis, believes in natural medication and has an eye for detail. But what truly differentiates her from other doctors is her humanity.\n\nMam, u may or may not remember some of the instances but the following instances will be etched in my mind forever when I think of you.\n\n1.\tThe first meeting, when you assured me that baby will be fine and I can still keep my baby. The words gave me a big trust on my Sai that, at this age with multiple complications, I can still keep my baby. \n2.\tWhen I discussed with you regarding my elder daughter health issue, you assured me that it\u2019s the Sai blessing, Its not 100% guarantee that my second baby will get the same health issue as my elder one.\n3.\tIts always you, when you assured me  it\u2019s the Sai direction, even without any pre planning for baby and the point of restart my career again, that I am expecting for my second little one.\n4.\tWhen the growth of the baby was low during my anomaly scan, you gave me the strength that it will fine by 7th month.\n5.\tI was really getting worried about my kidney valve issue about my baby, you confirmed words that it will be fine by 8th month was blessing for me. Don\u2019t know how your words came true, by 8th month baby growth and valve issue got fixed automatically.\n6.\tWhen my husband was out of station, and I was not able to sleep due to my mother in law\u2019s health, my Blood pressure was so much fluctuating. You guidance made me to feel better and sleep better.\n7.\tWhen I rushed to you because of the discharge during my 5th month, I was really worried that my water bug has got burst. Thanks for reassuring me that my baby was fine. The moral support you gave me during that time was really helpful as my husband was out of station because of his mother\u2019s health.\n8.\tWhen I rushed to you after 9 months, because of the pain in midnight. You assured me that it was not labour pain. It was because of the baby continuous movement.\n9.\tYou always suggested to do deliver on 1st and 2nd dec and not to delay anymore as the baby is developed and its risky because of my health. My fluid level was high. Blood pressure and sugar level was fluctuating.\n10.\tThanks for the understanding and did the surgery as per our fixed time on 6th Dec. \n11.\tThanks for the advice to do the delivery asap, looking at the condition, it was quite obvious that little more days delay would have spoiled my all dreams.\n12.\tWhenever I fell prey to breakdowns, you just sat and let me speak and gave me the support like a real close friend would.\n\nI cant even explain you what your reassuring voice has meant to me.\n\nSunil and I thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for being so thoughtful.\n\nWe wish you all the very best.\n\nOm Sairam!\n",

She helped us through our entire first pregnancy and helped us deliver a safe baby through a normal, healthy and safe method of delivery (NVD).  \n\nWe are encouraged and are happy to have Dr. Nagaveni as our go to doctor not just because of the methods she follows but also because she is friendly and is at arms reach as much as she could.  It is a rare find to have health care providers who ease patients and help them navigate through the problems with less stress.\n\nWe\u2019d strongly recommend Dr. Nagaveni for all women related health matters. \n\nThank you Doctor!",

This might get a bit long but I'm sure it would be useful and comforting for couples planning for their big moment.\n\nI will start with our first delivery experience in our home town far away from Bangalore 6 years ago. Unfortunately, we didn't had a good experience with the gynaecologist we consulted during that pregnancy and my wife also developed some complication at the delivery time, thankful to gods to help us sail through those times. So she was a lot apprehensive about reaching out to a female gynaecologist again (just one of those few biases you make up in your mind.) PS: Our 6 yr-old son is absolutely fit and healthy, and has waited eagerly along with us to welcome his younger sibling.\n\nSo it took me some to convince her to visit Dr.Nagaveni based on the reviews on practo and owing to proximity to the Ovum Kothanur clinic. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that my wife was floored with her first interaction and returned home all happy and optimistic. Dr. Nagaveni was all ears to all my wife's questions and in fact when we both went together explained to us in great detail about all the medical procedures and terms which we had learnt over web or were just curious about.\n\nDue to a certain clinical reason, we were also asked to refer to a Haematologist, and the best part is doctor suggested us where we could get the tests done at a lower price. To be honest, she is the first doctor we have met who showed genuine concern towards underlying cost of different tests or consultations. And suggested for a better and economical service if available, whenever asked. Kudos to her.\n\nCut to 17th August, we were blessed with a healthy baby and due to her timely precautions and alertness we never had to went through the complications we underwent during the first pregnancy. Please note that clinically there were ~10-15% chances of recurrence of the same complication in second pregnancy. She was always there to morally uplift us and gave us a clear understanding of issues at hand whenever we had some doubt.\n\nLast but not the least, our whole family would like to thank Dr.Nagaveni from the bottom of our hearts to be there when we needed someone we can trust on. And thus, we would strongly recommend Dr.Nagaveni to anyone who is planning or already planned for pregnancy. It's a long physical and emotional journey where you need a strong mentor to sail you through. Thank you ma'm once again!\n\nBest regards,\nGeetika & Tanmay",

Since this is our first pregnancy, we have lots of doubts and fear, but Nagaveni mam helped us in overcoming all these and guided us how to be happy and healthy. With the diet and continuous checkups and instructions we never faced any difficulties. Also whenever we have doubts we used to call her and she never disappointed us. Even though she was busy , she always attended our calls and clarified our doubts. With all her concerns and guidance, we blessed with a baby boy. Both mother and the kid doing great. \nWe would like to thank you Nagaveni mam for your support throughout this journey. Thanks a ton mam and personally I will suggest you to all upcoming parents to consider you since you are the best. \n\nThank You\nMr. and Mrs. Aswini Umesh Kumar ",

She is extremely humble , polite and has patience. She would give you as much time as you need. She would explain and advice in such a way that you would be left with very few doubts. Whenever i went for consultation i would always have a long list of questions but before me asking those, most of them were already covered. That's the beauty of Dr Nagaveni. \nShe gives a lot of attention and is quite caring. I felt very comfortable with her. Whenever i had any queries i would whatsapp her and she would reply me the same day.\n From the starting i wanted to deliver normally . Dr. Recommended me exercises and it really helped me a lot. During delivery i almost gave up because i was unable to bear the pain but doctor encouraged me and helped me along with some exercises and i delivered my baby girl through normal delivery. I feel really blessed that i got an opportunity to be under her guidance, because of her, my pregnancy journey was very smooth. I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family.",

I have conceived naturally and have started consulting from the day 1 of my pregnancy at disha clinic. We are glad and I would say it was a blessing that we had chosen her. We highly recommend doctor , you can chose doctor for your pregnancy journey without giving any second thought. Because with lot of fear I refused to do normal delivery and i wanted to go for section, but she wanted to do normal delivery and she has done it successfully. Last but not the least whenever we felt stressed and worried doctor always assured us with positive wordings. It was blessings that we chose her and we blessed with baby girl with vaginal delivery. Moreover doctor is easily reachable on WhatsApp/Phone calls to clarify our doubts and also readily accessible in all the times of our necessity. ",

We were bit nervous to change the doctor in the last minute, so we explored for a good doctor from online reviews and recommendations bit carefully. We have visited Dr Nagaveni just the previous day of delivery and the way she received us and went through all the reports and medications to understand the history gave us the confidence. We have visited her in Disha clinic and she only called Motherhood hospital and arranged delivery slot for us. She has given the clear instructions to follow from then to delivery time and she was responding to Whatsapp messages quickly in the late night also for the queries. Delivery went smoothly and during post delivery check ups also she was very friendly and responded well. Also she used to check and update the status of baby when baby is in NICU. She responded well in Whatsapp for the queries even after discharge and has given good care. Staff in Disha clinic were very friendly and provide timely updates if there are any delays in appointments due to emergency cases.\n\nOverall we were so happy with the last minute decision we have taken to chose Dr. Nagaveni.

We had visited a couple of doctor in the early stages of pregnancy and got multiple opinions, we were very scared and nervous. Later, my friend suggested to meet Dr. Nagaveni Mam. We had visited Mam in her clinic, she took all the time and listened to our problem and gave proper suggestion. Mam made our whole journey look very easy, and we were more confident after meeting her. The best part is Dr. Nagaveni Mam shared her personal contact number, to contact her in case of any emergency and If we were not able to make it up to her clinic, we will WhatsApp's her, and she will provide the medication over whats app. Among all the Doctors I met, Dr. Navaveni Mam is the best, and she has immense knowledge in her field. I would suggest you to meet her once and you will know the difference. From the day one we met Mam till the day we were blessed with a cute little baby Girl. Our parenthood journey was very smooth. We are very grateful and thankful to Dr. Nagaveni Mam. ",

Due to relocation we had to move to Hennur and that\u2019s when we got to know about Dr Nagaveni from our network in the area. She was very highly rated by everyone. Hence it was no brainer to start consulting with her. \n\nConsidering our history we were quite in a low phase of our lives.  However post our first interaction with Dr. we felt a sense of calm and came out with a positive frame of mind.  She started our treatment from scratch and explained each and every detail of the course of treatment she is considering for us. This gave us lot of clarity and kept us quite positive and hopeful. In last 1 year we have had regular follow ups with her and each time it was such a pleasure talking to her.  Also , she remained connected on WhatsApp throughout the journey and always made sure that she replies to all my small queries I used to get. The pregnancy journey brings myriad of questions and Dr was there to answer them all . That itself was a big relief and helped me managing the stress. \n\nFrom our 1 year journey we got to understand that her expertise in the field is second to none. She seems very passionate and committed to her work and her work ethic is of the highest order . We always felt that we were in our right hands for our treatment and had full faith in Dr. throughout the journey.  I can go on and continue writing so many nice things about her and that still won\u2019t do justice. However if I have to single out 1 thing then I would say - The best part about her is the way she patiently listened to all our questions ( I am sure many of them would be very silly.)  and answered them in great detail and still said- \u201cAnything else , \u201cChandni ?\u201d .  \n\nLast week with the grace of almighty and Doctor\u2019s guidance we have got our little bundle of Joy. We shall forever remain grateful to  Dr. Nagaveni .\n\nTo all the aspiring parents I would highly recommend Dr Nagaveni.\n\nThanks\nChandni",

It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!\nI am very happy to have found a doctor like her that I feel I can trust and connect with.\n\nHaving said all that, I would love to share my pregnancy journey .\nI was heavily bleeding one night and that was 7th week of my pregnancy,seeing that gush of blood ,I had lost all hopes.\nI called my doctor and she asked us to visit hospital , we went there and doctor was available late night, she did the scan and with God's grace, my baby was fine and the bleeding was because of subchroinic hematoma.I had taken the medicines as prescribed and was on complete bed rest for a month or two.\nThings might not have been the same ,had my doctor not been there that night,it's because of her availability and timely treatment ,everything went well.\nI must say, she is the first doctor that I have come across who would answer all queries no matter what time of the day you call or message her, she would never miss to reply.\n\nMy doctor had always insisted me to try for normal delivery and this happened ,my labour went well which wouldn't have been possible without her support.\n\nPS: Please accept our gratitude towards the gift you have given to our family. Conveying our regards to \"The Godly Hands\", who made sure his birth takes place in the healthiest manner possible. \nThank You\n",

Her friendliness, expertise in her job, availability support ensuring me and my baby\u2019s safety throughout the journey. \nFrom the beginning, Dr. Nagaveni showed a deep concern for my well-being which gave us confidence in her abilities. As a first-time mother I had lot of concerns and queries, she handled it so well, she always put mind at ease and peace with her guidance.\nIn my first trimester I had small blood deposit in my uterus, she recommended bed rest for first few months and when it dissolved she recommended exercise. She always motivated me to stay active throughout the pregnancy do all necessary work, go to office and always keep mind positive. \nOnce 9th month started, Dr. Nagaveni closely monitored my progress, explaining each step of the process and what I could expect during delivery. She has always motivated me for normal delivery.\nShe tried all the possibilities to induce labour but it didn\u2019t work at last we have to move to c-section, her dedication and commitment were evident throughout the process. \nI am from North India and my whole family recommended me to come over there, but when I met her for the first time I was sure for my first time experience I want her to be my doctor, her presence makes you feel warm and welcoming. With her I was always confident that I am in hands of a remarkable doctor who genuinely cares about me and my baby\u2019s well being.\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Nagaveni to all the expectant mothers.\nThank you Dr. Nagaveni and motherhood for the wonderful experience.",

But we stick to have a normal delivery & more than us Dr. Nagaveni stood with us and she tried all the best possible ways to do a normal delivery and finally I could do the normal delivery. My mother in law is more excited & calls the doctor a God. Seriously she is a god giftedWithout her our journey would be little difficult with the complications that we had during delivery time.I would strongly recommend my family, friends & those who are reading our Experience to consult Dr. Nagaveni for your smooth pregnancy journey.How many times ever we say \"Thank you\" to the Doctor it's less only, A very big thank you mam",

During third trimester She also suggested me household activities , exercises and few dietary things to keep all my vitals in check and ensuring baby and cervix are ready for normal delivery.\nI didn't get any contractions until week 40 and then she suggested pain Induction to ensure there is no complications later and normal delivery happens.\nI got admitted in my 40th week and delivered vaginally within 12 hours of admission, she took right decisions at each stage of my labor that my delivery is smooth and had a super positive birth experience.\nI really feel blessed to have her guidance and support.Most importantly even with her busy schedules she would always respond and answer to all my queries throughout pregnancy,and delivery days.\nSince I was referred to Dr. nagaveni by my fertility specialist Dr. From Motherhood hospital,she even kept communicating her about my pregnancy progress and which made me and my husband so happy that my previous Dr. Knows everything even before we informed her.\nI feel super blessed to have her and will recommend her to all my near and dear one's.",

For some reasons madam couldn't help us through the abnormal reports . We were shattered. Decided to go for Amniocentesis as advised by my doc. As a second opinion we consulted Dr Nagaveni madam . We visited her post going through all the google reviews. Our experience with her has been amazing and all the reviews about her are 100% true.\nShe has been very supportive, friendly & approachable. We were very concerned & nervous as it was first pregnancy with an anomaly observed but her positive aura and approach made the journey much easier.\nNo hi-fi medicines /unnecessary tests were prescribed. From the day 1 we moved on to Dr Nagaveni madam and started our journey with her , it was always pleasant and delightful experience for us . Till last minute Dr Nagaveni madam  was very confident and pushed us for normal delivery till the end. Throughout delivery she was very much available from 6 am to 10 pm  , supportive, positive and kept on encouraging . At last last I underwent C-Section on my choice. We were blessed with a baby girl  and both me and baby were healthy. Madam also was kind enough to remove my Fibroid and Hematoma . Also brilliantly dealt post partum complications and Pain management  . I could walk on the day 3 of C- Section.And could sit down criss-crossed on my day 7th of surgery.\n\nShe is the best we could have asked for this journey.\n\nI highly recommend her to all the to-be moms.\n\nThankyou Dr Nagaveni Madam  . we love you <3",

She\u2019s a blessing and I\u2019m so glad to travel this beautiful journey with her by our side \nWe just have to strictly follow her instructions and diet to have a healthy and normal delivery! When I developed Gestational Diabetes during post 5th month, we were very worried about the issues it would cause.. but with the help of the diet Mam gave I did not have to take a single tablet for it and controlled only with her diet. The weight of the baby was in total control.. \nshe was always available on calls at any point.. She answers the call immediately even if we call at 3am. In case of emergencies she arranges the entire team to attend to me till she comes and is always available to take care on time. Even when I had met with an accident, she had her entire team attend me immediately while she was on the way and I was given all the assurance about the baby\u2019s health and I was also taken care on time.. She will answer all your queries honestly and give you all the confidence we need\nI can\u2019t thank her enough for helping me have a healthy and normal delivery. She guides in such a way that we will have normal delivery unless there are any other complications.\nThe exercises she recommended helped me get the cervix dilated just in time without having to induce labour. \nIf you visit her you are at the right hand! My pregnancy journey was so great because of her!",

From the day 1 till delivery, she suggested the blood tests/ Injections/ scans if it's really needed. *** ***** ***** *** *********** ****** Dr Responded to all my phone calls and to my messages immediately, which helped me to go through the pregnancy peacefully. Always had a peaceful words and positive vibes from the doctor. Since the 1st delivery ( 8 yrs ago), i delivered baby before 36 week, which is pre-matured one. I'm very much worried on this. Dr took care of this matter completely. She promised me that she will do the delivery only after 37 weeks. Dr closely monitored my blood pressure morning and evening as i had bp fluctuations. It helped me a lot to keep myself relaxed in the last 2 weeks. Whenever i had any doubts in baby movements.. she cleared all the queries immediately and every time i will go back to home home happily after seeing the dr. Delivered baby girl on 38.2 weeks with good health and immediately shifted to room along with me. I had C section ( 1st one 8 years ago was also same). The recovery speed was much faster than my 1 St delivery and pain after surgery was also tolerable. My 2nd baby is 40 days now.. I'm able to all the works by my own and no issues post surgery. Dr is available and answering my queries over phone even after a month of c section. Disha clinic -helped in getting appointments whenever i requested. For all emergencies, they are allowing inside to meet the dr immediately without any delay. Most of the visits I waited only 15 mins. Thank to all the sisters. I definitely recommend Dr. Nagaveni mamand disha clinic to have a peaceful and relaxed pregnancy. Thank you so much to Dr. Nagaveni and the entire person in disha clinic \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

From our very first meeting, my husband and I both sensed an ease with approach. She was very methodical in every step and explained the reasons on every decision to be made. Even after every hurdle we encountered, she held our hands every step of the way, and gave us confidence that we will eventually become parents. Today we are thrilled to be parents and can\u2019t imagine being in this position without God and Dr. Nagaveni's support. She is truly an exceptional doctor, and I can\u2019t praise her enough.  In short, we had a great experience with her.I started seeing Dr. Nagaveni last year, when I quickly found out that conceiving would be a struggle. For someone that has wanted to be a mom, this was extremely devastating news, however Dr. Nagaveni quickly reassured me that I had numerous options, and that she was confident that I would be able to get pregnant. Dr. Nagaveni continued to be extremely supportive, caring, and positive. She patiently answered our numerous questions, and thoroughly addressed all our concerns. Never once making us feel rushed. Her attention and dedication were the same high level during my first consultation, as it was during my last appointment. She responded to every whatsapp and phone message that I left for her. At times, I truly felt like I was her only patient. She was fabulous on both a personal and professional level. She made both my husband and me extremely comfortable during stressful situations. She is incredibly knowledgeable and patient. I would strongly recommend her to any family and friend, without hesitation. She truly is an exception doctor, and a caring human being.Sincerely,\u2014Satisfied Patient of DR. Nagaveni",

We took our first appointment with Dr. Nagaveni at the Ovum clinic Kothanur, and that\u2019s when we knew that I was pregnant. \n\nDoctor is friendly and explains each tests like blood tests, scan and treatments, injections in detail, why it\u2019s done and when it should be done and all that. She does not suggest any unnecessary tests and procedures. She makes us feel comfortable. All the staffs in the clinic are also very friendly. Throughout my journey with Ovum I felt everyone are service oriented. \n\nFor my scans I had to go to the Ovum hospital at Kalyan Nagar. Except for the wait time my experience with scan was good. I had my scans done by 3 different doctors there and all were very patient and proficient in their job. I realised why each scan takes lot of time as it all depends on the baby\u2019s position and other factors and that too when there are other patients like me, well there is nothing wrong in waiting for my turn. \n\nDr. Nagaveni is easily approachable by phone, and whatsapp. Anything that we need to ask her or inform her regarding health, she responds back on the phone. After I got admitted at the Ovum hospital for my delivery, Doctor was periodically checking with the duty doctors and nurses regarding my condition and advice prescription and my diet and all that. My delivery happened early morning around 2:00 am. By then she quickly made arrangements and teamed up with few more doctors who also did an amazing job in the OT. Even post surgery, she made sure I was taken care of and kept calling the nurse station to check on me. she explained all the procedures and management processes until discharge. She takes personal care of all her patients even post surgery. She is such a dedicated Doctor. I would strongly recommend her for Gynec related problems. \n\nNot to forget the NICU at Ovum. The paediatricians and Nurses at the NICU took  good care of my baby and have seen them caring for them as their own.",

She is not only an extremely talented  gynaec but also a very compassionate and amazing human being. To begin with, I had been diagonised with PCOS and hypothyroidism since a long time and therefore we decided to consult a gynaec before planning for pregnancy. After meeting a couple of doctors , when we met Nagaveni Mam, we decided that she is the one . We felt that we will be in safest hands had been continued with her. She listens to all the concerns, clears all doubts and queries and explains everything in an understandable manner. She never prescribes any redundant tests or medicines. She reassured me that just by following healthy  diet and exercise and very few medication , PCOS will be under control and I can conceive. And as rightly advised I conceived within a couple of months. But unfortunately I miscarried at an early stage.. Nagaveni Mam constantly boosted me up emotionally, mentally apart from taking care of my physical well being.She reassured that I can soon conceive again.. I always felt so confident and relaxed after every visit with her. After four months, I conceived again. She took all the necessary measures to ensure that all goes well.  These nine months of my pregnancy journey has been amazing under her supervision. She has been so approachable personally, over call and watsapp as well, clarified our endless doubts and questions. On 10th Feb 2022, I delivered a healthy baby girl through C section..She tried her best for normal delivery but things were not progressing as it should. Hence, we opted for C section. She has also taken immense post partum care to ensure the healing and recovery process is fast. I would highly recommend Dr. Nagaveni Mam to all my friends, relatives and acquaintances. Thank you Mam, for making our dream come true and help giving us the most precious gift  of our life.. ",

Right from the beginning, she has guided us very well on each and every important aspect (medications, diet, tests, scans, exercises for normal delivery etc.). In every visit, we had ample time with Dr. Nagaveni during consultation and the doctor listened to all our issues/queries patiently and provided proper answers. \nOne impressive thing is the fact that Dr. Nagaveni remembers her patients and pregnancy progress very well. We were pleasantly surprised when the doctor has recalled some important findings from our earlier scan reports/test reports correctly. Moreover, the doctor is easily reachable on phone/whatsapp to clarify our doubts and also readily accessible in times of necessity. \nWhen my wife had signs of labour, we could call the doctor immediately and the doctor visited hospital on a very short notice for performing the delivery. The doctor was also very proactive and she was in constant touch with the hospital staff to know the condition and even ensured that all arrangements are made for the delivery by the time she reached the hospital. After reaching the hospital, the doctor quickly attended to my wife and helped in delivering a healthy baby. We are very pleased with the doctor's care during pregnancy, delivery and also post the delivery. \nOverall, our experience with Dr. Nagaveni has been wonderful. She is so friendly that we feel we are talking to a family member. Dr. Nagaveni is exceptional in her area of expertise and is very knowledgeable. She takes good care of patients and we are very happy for consulting Dr. Nagaveni. We would highly recommend Dr. Nagaveni to anyone. Once again, we thank Dr. Nagaveni and also the hospital staff for a memorable journey.",

She would never conclude quickly over medicine dosages, her explanations always were backed up with 100% diagnosis. Her explanations and experience and knowledge made me comfortable with her. I started my journey of pregnancy with her and ended also with her. I had a very complicated pregnancy towards the end. Through the pregnancy everything was normal but as reached towards the end came to know that I had been bleeding internally for a very long time in my womb. My surgery was a life saver which she performed on me. I want to thank and acknowledge her presence of mind and how closely she monitored me after my delivery. I was critical but she is so dedicated towards her patients and work specially on those days towards me that my parameters slowly were brought to normal. Very less do I see doctors who end up becoming friends as well. She is easily approachable. On phone she is accessible which really is helpful in times of need and emergency. There were times where because of pregnancy challenges in the body I would need some emotional support. That too I have seen her often being an emotional healing counselor to me. I am very happy to have her as my doctor. I am very happy to show all my cases to her and really recommend her to my friends as well as she is among the best doctors I have had my experience with which means she looks very genuinely at the interest of her patients which gives me lot of content with her. I can trust her because I know she wants the best for me and I have experienced it. ",

My journey was not very smooth as I had some complications. Being a first time mother, I was in panic mode. She guided me so well and helped me to cope up with it. Instead of introducing everything at once, she took it step by step and prepared me for normal delivery. In the delivery room, we gave up due to excessive labour pain but she kept us going and motivated me to go ahead. We delivered a healthy baby and I am really thankful to her for that.\nTo add, she is always available over whatsapp for queries and even silly questions. I would highly recommend her to everyone. You can close your eyes and trust her. ",

Her friendliness towards the patients was very good. She explained each and every challenges that we faced during pregnancy journey. In third trimester I was diabetic she explained the consequences about the normal delivery if I wouldn't have maintained proper diet plan. I followed strict diabetic diet to maintain the baby ideal weight. \nDue date has come but no water leakage no abdominal pain. Nagaveni mam checked my condition she said to us about the induce process so admitted in Motherhood hospital around 11pm. after inducing I started getting the contractions doctor is checking my condition for every 15 mins after second dose of induce. Doctor tried very hardly for normal delivery I was dilated upto 4cms by next day 5pm but the baby head was up and baby head was big, baby heart beat is flat. Normal delivery is difficult in my case we didn't want to take risk so ended up with c section delivery. It's a baby girl.\nNagaveni mam was very supportive throughout my pregnancy journey. She is the best gynecologist anyone could reach out to her without any doubt.",

I consulted her both at disha and motherhood hospital. She's a very patient, calm and understanding especially when it comes to answering doubts be it in person or on phone ( WhatsApp or call). She doesn't believe in unnecessary medication and more over she's very open to discussion on your birth plan or incase of any other query. I was very particular about having a Normal delivery and she made it possible for me by suggesting different exercises, activities and diet, even though I waited up until 40 weeks to deliver. She's been really helpful even with my post delivery recovery. Pregnancy is a time where you want to consult someone who can patiently communicate with you given all your doubts and questions, not suggest you unnecessary medication and someone who guides you through those 9 months and post delivery care hence would 100% recommend Doctor.",

I was on bed rest for the majority of the time. She made sure that the pregnancy progressed well, keeping in mind the well-being of my child and me throughout. Despite the complications, she assured me of a NORMAL delivery, and on February 10th, we delivered a healthy baby girl NORMALLY. My family is extremely grateful to Dr. Nagaveni.

Right from day one doctor guided us in the right way since there was a gap from our first child. From the moment we walked into the clinic we were greeted with warmth and professionalism by the doctor and her staff. Even though I had spotting multiple times initially, doctor took the right care and gave the medications so that we continued with the pregnancy. Doctor advised me with the right diet plan without any medicines for my gestational diabetes. With the best care, we delivered our baby girl 3 weeks back on 2nd Oct. Even though it was a holiday + long weekend doctor made the delivery process very smooth and comfortable. Thank you mam.\n\nShe\u2019s an excellent, committed and proficient doctor and I highly recommend her to everyone looking for their pregnancy journey. She\u2019s so patient and listens to all our concerns and clarifies to our utmost satisfaction. She always responds to out WhatsApp messages and clarifies all our doubts even though we are away.\n\nWe once again thank you mam for making our family complete and our hearty wishes for your continued service !!!",

We've approached the doctor at 9 weeks of my pregnancy based on the feedback posted in the Practo page after a very bad experience with another gynaecologist in our area.\n\nStarting from the day 1 till delivery she was very friendly and advised me correctly with a diet plan for my Gestational Diabetics. She makes sure to explain every detail and at the end of each consultation, despite answering so many questions she would still ask with a smile \u2018Anything else? \u2018.\n\nShe always responded to WhatsApp messages and always picked our call even if it was early morning around 6AM when I got initial labour pain. She always encouraged and helped me to have a normal delivery and it happened at 36 weeks and during labour pain she motivated me a lot (Unforgettable memories in my lifetime) and which helped me to push more for normal delivery. After delivery I was treated and examined thoroughly, making sure everything was fine. My whole family is happy for Normal Delivery and we are very thankful to the Doctor.\n\nI would highly recommend her for any related treatments/consultation. I am giving 5*** Rating for the service. Our experience with her has been amazing and all the reviews about her are 100% true. Keep up the good work Madam.\n\nThank you,\nKavitha Vinodh Kumar",

From the very first appointment till the last she was humble and always answered our doubts patiently. Always responded to WhatsApp messages and always picked our call even if it was early morning or late night. I didn\u2019t know I had internal bleeding issue in the early stage of pregnancy which she diagnosed and I was advised complete bed rest for two months. Throughout my pregnancy I never faced any other complications. She advised the right medications, food and exercises at the right time and always pushed for normal delivery. When I was in labor and in so much pain for 22 hours straight  I had given up and asked for C section but Dr Nagaveni was ready to wait for another 10 hours and asked me to try for normal delivery. God had other plans and after 21 hours of labor my baby\u2019s heart beat started dipping and I was taken for an emergency C section. She never unnecessarily pushed for C section. I would highly recommend her to anyone.\nWe are so grateful we met her. \nThank you Doctor :) ",

Despite my age, I visited multiple hospitals where most doctors suggested that a normal delivery might not be possible. However, Dr. Nagaveni instilled hope in us and assured us that she would make every effort for a normal delivery.\nWe encountered another challenge when the baby's weight was around 4 kg, a serious concern. Nevertheless, Dr. Nagaveni remained steadfast in her commitment, and the result was a successful normal delivery. Our experience with the doctor has been flawless from the beginning until now. Her politeness and calm demeanor greatly contributed to our confidence in the treatment.\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Nagaveni to anyone seeking medical care. Her dedication and competence promise the best treatment experience without any hassle. \n\nI am giving 5***** Rating for the service.\n",

That was one of the best decisions of my pregnancy journey. \nFrom day 1 of the consultation till date she has been extremely kind and patient in answering all my queries and ensured that all my doubts are cleared before taking any decisions. From the anomaly scan it was clear that my uterine artery PI resistance was high and it could lead to certain scenarios like SGA, IUGR, gestational hypertension etc. I was well informed about each of them and was asked to monitor BP, sugar etc on timely basis. Monthly scans were done to ensure baby\u2019s growth was adequate however in the end I had an IUGR case which made me a bit anxious about my baby\u2019s health however the doctor explained with her personal experience that such babies eventually gains weight and grows normally post delivery. I ended up with a well informed C section coz baby\u2019s head was too high and wasn\u2019t engaged till week 39. Doctor explained every minute detail of how normal delivery progresses and why the chances of normal delivery were less in my case by week 39. I am completely satisfied that Dr. Nagaveni was an integral part of my pregnancy journey and I would highly recommend her to all my friends planning their pregnancy. ",

Nagaveni 3 years back for pre pregnancy care and to help with conception . she recommebded the right and simple procedures and the right diet and after 2 years we naturally conceived. My pregnancy journey was so detailed at every visit and doctor was available on phone anytime I had any doubts. She took care of my diet and exercise tips for normal delivery. During my 36th week we found that amniotic fluid was low. She immediately guided the hospital   to give me IV   infusion which helped prolong my pregnancy by another 2 Weeks. We decided through doctors guidance to induce labour and safely deliver our baby . The hospital was already prepared  and informed by doctor about my case before I reached.  At 38 weeks we delivered a healthy baby boy through normal vaginal Delivery.  During my delivery time doctor was attending to another C section patient at the same time.Yet   she handled both cases wit confidence and calm. I continue to visit her for post partum care and visit disha clinic to consult dr. Suresh gowda for our newborn . Her encouraging  nature and team of nurses at motherhood and at disha clinic  made it possible for me to have a very positive and memorable birth experience. My husband and I recommend doctor Nagaveni  and we are immensely grateful for helping us enter into the journey of parenthood.  ",

We were so blessed to meet maam before planning our second child. \nOn our first visit, we were delighted that Dr. Nagaveni maam listened us very patiently and explained us the systematic approach. With her proper guidance and support, I conceived within a very few months.\n\nBest thing about maam is that she is very friendly and always reachable to our queries. She shared her personal number with us for any kind of support during pregnancy and always responded to our queries instantly even during working hours or late evening.  At times, i truly felt that I was her ONLY patient. \nDuring the pregnancy, when i had gestational diabetes, maam was so concerned about the risk and was checking my sugar readings regularly and guided us with proper diet and routine. She was very positive and with her proper care, I delivered a healthy baby boy.\n\nTruly speaking, i had never met such a Doctor like Nagaveni maam. My pregnancy journey was memorable with maam. I can surely say, she is not only the best doctor in Bangalore but also a great mentor for prenatal journeys as well. We will highly recommend maam.\n\nThank you so much maam !!  We are always grateful to you.\n\nRegards\nIpsita & Deepak",

So much so that this was my second pregnancy and I was quite certain that my pregnancy would be normal, non-invasive, built on my body's intelligence & abilities, rather than too much intervention, unless unavoidable. It turned out to be a C-Section delivery due to breech conditions. But thanks to Dr. Nagaveni, my expectations for a smooth delivery fell in place effortlessly. Dr.Nagaveni pleasant and positive demeanour put me at ease immediately. She never bothered us with any unnecessary & complicated detail about the pregnancy that could have thrown us off the edge. We just waited with butterflies in our stomachs to welcome our child. She conducted the delivery in 5 mins after administering the anesthesia. The motto 'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act, but a habit'. This accurately defines my Doctor.\n\nThanks Dr. Nagaveni ma'am (the Lady Tigress' Prowess) and the Disha Clinic (@kothanur Junction) team. You read the situation from my first consultation in Dec 2021 and finally helped us experience a comfortable delivery. We are grateful to you and wish more expecting mothers consult you to build their pregnancies on their abilities.",

In my NT scan we found I had bilateral notch (a new term, never heard before) I was scared and nervous, but Dr again gave us the right medication at the right time which gave us confidence. Latter as my pregnancy progressed, I developed gestational diabetes and low hemoglobin, she helped with the diet plan. At 37th week Baby was breach; she was there to give me the right exercises and get the baby to position. \nFinally, at 39th week with 12 hrs of labor pain was able to deliver my angle who was 3.34 kgs.\n\nIn short Dr. Nagaveni is the best gynecologist in Bangalore. Even though I stay 15kms away I decided to stick with her for many reasons. Her patience and knowledge in the field are the topmost. She is always available on WhatsApp\u2019s, call, messages. We have no words to express how grateful and thankful we are to her. I definitely recommend Dr Nagaveni for all the issues. \n",

She was very warm and friendly. She sat down with us for about 45 mins answering all our queries and explaining the possible medical treatments to aid us in conception. For us it was a long journey of about 3 years with 2 non-viable pregnancies before my wife could finally conceive. And during all these years, Dr Nagaveni has journeyed with us with much empathy. She not only provided expert medical care but also emotional support. She is 100% committed to her patients. She was always available and responsive both during in-person visits and on phone calls/texts during emergencies. To cut the long story short, it was Dr Nagaveni who delivered our child recently and continues to provide postnatal care for my wife. My wife and I have been very pleased with Dr Nagaveni's expertise and care and would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking assistance with infertility issues, pregnancy, and childbirth. *** ** ********** *** ** *** **** ************ ** **** ***** ",

At each visit, she took the time to explain procedures and practices while listening and addressing any of my doubts and concerns. Her medical expertise is excellent - even though there were some complications during my delivery, she maintained a calm demeanor, and encouraged me to keep going even when things were tough. If it weren't for her, i may have been rushed to have an emergency c section. I was also very touched by the level of detailed care - she paid keen attention to every little detail and aspect of mine and my baby's health. No matter what time of day it was, she was always available. In fact, she would call me if I had not come in to see her and also monitored me through the night during delivery even though the doctor on call was also monitoring me. As a doctor, you get the feeling that she really takes care of you and that's very comforting to a pregnant mother. I would highly recommend her. ",

She was extremely patient with all our questions and gave us a very structured approach to the treatment. Under her care, I conceived within 6 months. Throughout my pregnancy, she was always present for us whenever we had any doubts. I developed gall bladder stones and was not in town at that time. The doctor made herself available and guided me over the phone regarding what to do. Towards the end of my pregnancy I developed pregnancy induced hypertension. Dr. Nagaveni was extremely vigilant regarding my BP levels and checked in almost daily with me. My delivery was a bit complicated, but Dr. Nagaveni made sure to keep me in the loop regarding whatever was going on and kept me and my husband involved in the decision making process. I finally delivered a healthy baby boy and I couldn't recommend Dr. Nagaveni more to any couple who wishes to conceive. She is an asset to whoever consults her and whichever institute she is attached to. ",

I haven't seen such doctors who personally call and get the my health status and suggest the further treatment. \n\nMy labour room experience:\nMy labour pain was started at 8pm and Dr. Nagaveni checked and told contraction has not started but it was in the initial state and we admitted in the hospital and but Dr. Nagaveni was calling each hour to get the my status and exactly at 4am clock after when I my labour pain actually started we informed ma'am and she was there in 10 min and started my treatment as normal delivery, Unfortunately I was not able to push properly, tried pushing for more then 10 time but I was supporting properly in pushing from my side and After that we decided let's do last push and if it doesn't work out then will go with Scesserion. And then the magic happened in last push with great effort of Dr. Nagaveni and her staff. They did really great job and in final push my angel was out. Really appreciate the hard work of Dr. Nagaveni. We always remember the day we spent in labour room, Thanks you so much Dr. Nagaveni Ma'am. \n\nGreat Job!!! Appreciate it!!! **** ******** Hard working!! Caring!! ",

From the beginning itself, untill I had to leave the town to my native, in my seventh month, she was the caring hands for me. Ma'am is completely dedicated and she responds to the calls and messages. She patiently listened to all my queries throughout these seven months and gave explainations to all the queries. From the begining itself she gave advices and instructions on maintaining proper health and diet. She explained everything with minute details like a teacher or rather like a elder sister. She keenly monitored the weekly growth and pinpointed the issues of weight gain. In my case she helped me to control my wight in my sixth month by giving me advice on proper diet which helped a lot. It was a pleasure and happy journey with you Doctor and I wished to continue consulting with you. However as the conditions were not conducive here, I had to move to my native.\nThank you Dr Nagaveni ma'am for all the advices and help.",

She always recommends vaginal delivery. Don't go by her age, She is so well experienced at such young age. I had my delivery 15 days prior to the due date. As my water broke at 3am, I gave a missed call, not sure if she would be distributed. She gave me a call back immediately even if she didn't have my number saved and asked me to relax and come to the hospital immediately. I will always be grateful for her approach that night. I delivered by morning with no complications. Her treatment during and procedures post delivery was exceptional. She made sure that all the blood clots were removed for my better recovery. She made sure to visit me and examine twice daily. \nI had the best experience delivering under the able and experienced hands of Dr. Nagaveni. ",

About the Doctor: She is very friendly, hassle free availability at clinic and the birthing center, also shares her phone number and replies to messages, gives indepth explanation of all issues, but Prudence and her timing sense are her best qualities in my opinion. She does not prescribe unnecessary tests or medications. About the Pregnancy: We hit a few bumps along the way, but with her guidence we got through it successfully. Started off with spotting in early pregnancy which continued on and off throughout the pregnancy, she prescribed bed rest and some medication to get through it. Then was diagnosed with a grade 4 placenta previa, which is a common complication during pregnancy, but comes with its own share of risks, she gave me very strict bed rest, and gave me a good roadmap on how the rest of the pregnancy would go. I was covid positive with mild symptoms, she remotely guided me through it, she also followed up on my health. The C-section: because of the placenta previa Asthma and Covid, we had to resort to a planned C-section on the 2nd of November, it went very well.... Now I am on my way to recovery. with decent hb count.... All thanks to doctor. I am very grateful to her. ",

We were really excited. Met her and she suggested few test immediately. After the tests and scans were done we got to know the baby didn't have heart beat. She was real supportive and educated us why it might have happened and until the feutus was completely removed, she suggested us to do the scans regularly to check for any infection at all. We got pregnant again in January 2020, and we were excited to see her again. We met her and as usual she suggested the test and scans to be done immediately. This time we heard the heart beat. Oh god that feeling. We came back to see her again, and she was as excited as us. After that there were regular visits to the clinic, she was always available over the phone as well. Tests and scans were done regularly. The day of the delivery she was with us all the while, talking to us, motivating us. My wife had a Normal Vaginal Delivery and it was only possible because of Dr. Nagaveni. Thank you doctor, thank you again \ud83d\ude0a You are Awesome!",

By God's grace, we got to know Dr.Nagaveni through one of our relatives. From our 1sr consultation with the Doctor, I knew she was the one and there was no turning back. The way she advised us and treated me made feel like we had known her for years  and she was extremely motivating for vaginal delivery from the start which was always my desire. She made us feel very comfortable and was always available on phone for all our queries. The night I delivered my baby girl, I had called the Doctor saying I had mild contractions and she immediately responded by asking us to the come to the hospital and got me admitted and ensured I had a vaginal delivery. I was beyond satisfied with the way Doctor treated me and I would hands down recommend her for pregnancy and also her post pregnancy treatment was fabulous. She constantly kept checking on my health and the baby's health. I am extremely satisfied and happy with Dr. Nagaveni, I had a very pleasant and happy and memorable experience with her\ud83d\ude0a.",

After reading the reviews had an appointment with the doctor and visited Ovum clinic at Kothnur for checkup in the starting of my pregnancy, she explained everything clearly, shared her contact number at our first visit. She is one who treats her patients with care and take a sincere responsibility. We really chose a great doctor where I felt safe in her hands through out my pregnancy journey as she helped me clearing my queries at any point of time. She explains things not only to the patient but to the family members as well. We wanted to avoid c section as I was overweight and doctor guided me about exercise and diet during every visit. I had a labour pain 10days before the due date and was 95kg, baby weighed 3.5 had no hope of having normal delivery. After 17hours of labour pain with the doctor support and help I delivered my baby Girl in a normal way with no complications. I and my husband are completely satisfied and heartfully thank her for making our 9 months of pregnancy go in a smooth way. We surely recommend Dr. Nagaveni for our friends, relatives and who are in need of good gynecologist. Here wishing her very all the best for her work and future.. \n",

More than a good doctor we also found her as a friend who would not only help you with everything but also dicuss things and make you feel good. \n4. For any complications and issues she is herself prepared like be it any emergency or need for blood or anything else. \n5. And overall as a wonderful human being she was actually with us during the entire journey taking care of many many things without we even reminding her. \nSo I would highly recommend her to anyone else who is starting  their pregnancy journey. \nThanks you Dr Nagaveni it was a unique experience with such a nice doctor and hope we have more and more doctors like you.

I still remember the day when we were looking for a doctor who can understand the concerns of first-time expectant and guide them with much care. Plus, this was the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, when no other gynecologists were ready to see new patients and accepting only emergency cases. In that situation, I got Dr. Nagveni's mobile number from one of my friends. I contacted her and she consulted me over the phone first, and then in the coming week, I consulted her personally in Ovum, Kalyan road. After every appointment, I realized that I can't be in safer hands than this. One more noteworthy point is - she knew that am going to shift to Pune for my delivery and going to be under her treatment for just the initial 6 months of pregnancy, still, her attitude never changed. She genuinely paid attention to each of my concerns with love and care. I and my husband are truly thankful to her.  I strongly recommend Dr. Nagveni to all the would-be-Moms! ",

We were new to Bangalore and went to Ovum Birthing Center for getting the check up done with Dr.Nagaveni after being referred by Dr.Gowri. Right from the first pregnancy scan till the labor we had complete support from the doctor. My wife had various complications during her pregnancy and with those we never believed it would be a normal delivery. On May-7-2020 early morning 2:15 AM her water bag broke and we rushed to the hospital. Although it\u2019s untime, after duty doctor checked her , hospital rang Dr.Nagaveni and immediately from that time she was completely available. Since my wife blood group is rare and on top of it due to Covid issue , there was difficulties in arranging donors. Although it\u2019s not the duty of the doctor to do, she also gave an helping hand by calling hospitals and arranged one at 3:30. This gave us some more time to arrange one more donor . All these were done just as a back up if it can\u2019t be a normal delivery. Doctors and other staffs gave their best and with Gods grace after nearly 15 hours Of labor it was a normal delivery. All through this time baby\u2019s heart rate and everything was monitored continuously . \nA special thanks to Dr.Nagaveni doctor as she is one of the few doctors I have seen who would be in constant touch with their patients and would reply in whatsapp anytime for queries and updates.

Dr Nagaveni is one such person.\n\nShe has been very kind, empathetic and understanding and a truly outstanding doctor. She patiently listened to all my concerns and even ensured I followed a healthy diet and kept my weight & sugar levels in control during the entire pregnancy period. She always responds to your silliest queries, gives adequate time and always available on WhatsApp for any doubt. She always encouraged me to go for natural birth and till the last moment persuaded me to go for a normal delivery but I was too tired and fearing for safety of my child (showed 3.6 kg in last scan) I finally decided on a Cesarean. Trust me I have never seen a doctor so disappointed that we decided not to go for a normal delivery! I was blessed with a lovely baby girl and ever thankful to Doctor for her care.\n \n Dr Nagaveni has shown incredible commitment throughout providing the absolute best care, advice and treatment during every visit and for every issue. \n\nI am completely satisfied with her treatment and would recommend her. A very genuine, experienced *** ************* doctor.\n",

As it was my first pregnancy, i was little scared and during initial consultations itself i felt that I am in safe hands. She shared her number during our first consultation and insisted to call or msg anytime if we have any issues and she has always responded to our calls and msgs. She use to explain everything related to my pregnancy in detail and has never prescribed any unnecessary medications or scans. Though she has many patients, she use to remember each and every small thing related to my pregnancy. She is very dedicated, caring and proactive. She use to ping and call us to enquire about my sugar levels and BP. I choosed c section over normal delivery as I was scared and could not tolerate pain but she tried to motivate and convince me to go for normal which is very rare. She performed the surgery and has provided very good pre and post delivery care. She is an excellent doctor and I would highly recommend her to all my relatives and friends.",

After the procedure I had to get admitted in hospital for few days to monitor my sugar levels. During the hospital days she used to call up the nurse station early mornings to know my sugar levels. She  was also very helpful regarding financial aspect and guided us with insurance. I had to be on bed rest for rest of the maternity period and she helped us in arranging ambulance for routine checkups. She used to ping me and enquire about my health and sugar levels and all the time. I was free to ping or call her any time to ask about any doubts and she used to respond very quickly. She is very kind and dedicated doctor and she listened to my doubts and concerns with patience. I would recommend her name to all the expecting mothers. She is the best \ud83d\ude0a.\n\n",

And of course, her effort to look her best and smile at all times makes icing on cake\nI thank you for all your support",

She prescribed minimal medicines and was able to take preventive measures based on my symptoms from the first pregnancy so that I don't have to face the same issues this time. We feel really lucky to have found her and would highly recommend her.",

Her expertise and support made all the difference in ensuring a safe and successful delivery of the baby. \n\nFrom the beginning, Dr. Nagaveni showed a deep concern for my well-being. She got to know me personally and professionally, which fostered trust and confidence in her abilities. As a first-time mother, I had my share of anxieties, but Dr. Nagaveni's reassurance and calming presence always put my mind at ease. \n\nAs my due date approached, Dr. Nagaveni meticulously monitored my progress, explaining each step of the process and what I could expect during labor. Her clear and informative communication made me feel empowered and prepared for delivery day. \n\nWhen the time came, Dr. Nagaveni demonstrated incredible skill and composure during labor. She guided me through each contraction, offering encouragement and support, while ensuring baby and I were safe. Her dedication and commitment were evident throughout the process. \n\nThanks to Dr. Nagaveni's expertise and compassionate care, I had the natural birth experience I wanted. She respected my birth plan and worked collaboratively with the nursing staff to create a warm and supportive environment. Dr. Nagaveni is an exceptional obstetrician, but her genuine care for her patients truly sets her apart. She went above and beyond to make the birthing experience smooth, and I felt truly fortunate to have her by my side. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Nagaveni to any expectant mother seeking a compassionate and skilled obstetrician. Her dedication and passion for her work have undoubtedly left a lasting impression on me and my family. \n\nThank you, Dr. Nagaveni, for being an essential part of my birthing journey and for making it a memorable and joyous experience.",

She was always available for our queries and emergencies through out my pregnancy. I was diagnosed with dengue in my 6th month of pregnancy and with her early diagnosis and clear instructions I was able to quickly recover .I would surely recommend Dr Nagaveni for all the couples trying to conceive and deliver a healthy child. She is definitely one of the best Gynecologist . Under her guidance I was able to deliver through Normal delivery. Every month I visited her she gave us proper guidance on what tests/ scans that needed to be taken , diet which I should follow etc. She also advised me to do exercises which helped me with normal delivery.",

She used to clear our doubts by sometimes sharing her experiences with similar situation with others. She patiently listens to our queries and fears and provide best advice as per her knowledge. In every situation she used to be calm and give us confidence that everything is going to be alright in the end. If sometimes anything more or less in my blood test report, she didn't used to exaggerate or scare us, calmly she used to tell us, nothing to be worried and it is solvable by recommending foods and all. She is also reachable anytime if something is wrong, over a message or a call. I would definitely recommend her for my friends and family. Thank you for all your advice and care doctor.",

Wonderful Journey and Great Experience. \n\nMy wife Dr. Benu and I, visited for our complete Pregnancy Care - Pregnancy Test, Pregnancy Scan & Excercise and Normal Vaginal Delivery. \n\nFriendliness: Firstly, we appreciate the Dr. Nagaveni for being very calm, compound and so friendly which really helps us to connect with her in ease. \n\nExperience & Knowledge: She provide us enough time to converse and to explain the issues. She advise us in detail and ensure we understand her advise clearly. She helps us with the daily routines and meal plan with normal diet for a natural and healthy pregnancy journey. \n\nTreatment: We are regularly having our monthly pregnancy checkup from day one with Dr. Nagaveni and scan in every trimesters. Right from first, we had low line placenta until 34th week. She encouraged us at every visit. She prescribed us only Calcium and Iron tablet and nothing else through out our pregnancy. Having only home cooked healthy meal and prescribed fruits/ dry fruits time to time naturally. \n\nNormal Delivery: Yes! We had a Normal Vaginal Delivery. In the week 37 and 6 days, we got the pain in the midnight 3:30 AM and immediately we alerted the Doc. We went to the hospital and everything is ready to take care us. After 5 cm dilated at labour, though the Doctor was confident, we still opted for Epidural as we couldn't bear the pain. With Almighty's help and everyone's support in labour, we went from 5 cm to 10 cm directly in an hour and half time. And then, It's a Boy! \n\nSatisfaction: She taught us the exercise and have knowledge about pregnancy every month. She made sure pregnancy is not just a women's thing it's the couple where the husband also played a key role equally. And my husband had a good experience during delivery who was able to witness everything. Throughout our pregnancy any doubt, she was just a text away who replies immediately to our call and text. We felt super satisfied and happy. \n\nWho ever comes here to check the review - trust me, Dr. Nagaveni - *** ***** **** ** ********* *** Excellent Experience! \n\nWe wish all the readers of our review, New Mom's, Mom to be and Dr. Nagaveni for a healthy and happy life. \n\nThanks, \nDr. Benazir & Vasim",

On my very first visit to see  Dr Nagaveni and explaining to her the process we had been through previously, not knowing that taking a second opinion during the 8th month was a good move Dr Nagaveni's  approach to our case really assured me that i and my growing baby were in safe hands. That started off my journey with Dr Nagaveni..\nI must say She's a gentle Giant, extremely hospitable and one of those who will go an extra mile for her Patients, all I can think of is that this kind of Nature in an individual (especially a doctor) can only stem from a place of just not a profession but a heart to Love and Serve People.\nAlthough my journey with Dr Nagaveni Started during end of my final trimester, I was never made to feel inadequate or any less confident for a Normal Delivery. \nDr Nagaveni is a Perfect Balance of Great character and rigorous experience in her Field. All my sessions with her were extremely helpful and only helped me towards a good and safe delivery of my baby.\nOn the 4th of September 2020 I delivered a gorgeous baby boy at Around 11:40PM, Since this was my First pregnancy and not knowing what to expect or have felt the intensity of the contractions prior Dr Nagaveni's consist Advices through out the day really helped me make it...I really want to thank her  although she was done with her duty for the day, within an hr of knowing that I was in Active Labour and time for delivery she made it back to the hospital and delivered our child.\nThis is to the best my honest and sincere endorsement to anybody for Dr Nagaveni.",

Firstly the approach of friendliness to share details to patient and discussing the pros and cons of situation and medications. She treated us really well throughout the whole consultation process. Suggestions she gave on Dos and Donts were fruitful to give birth to our baby. Next comes is the most significant thing which is the delivery would be normal or Cessarian. She has been trying very hard for normal delivery and keeps doing it. The situation she creates for normal delivery is sincerely commendable. So because of her support, I did normal delivery of my baby. The doctor is outstanding in treating her patients and we would definitely reccommend her for people who hope to deliver baby normally because thats what Dr.Nagaveni is trying for her patients.",

The best thing about her is that she will be available for her patients for any emergensies, at any time. I didnot regret even a single time for chosing her as my OB.

She was easily accessible whenever I needed guidance or had queries. She provided insightful suggestions and fully  supported my decision for a VBAC. Her guidance on exercises during pregnancy was invaluable, and she helped me effectively manage gestational diabetes through diet and exercise. During labor, her expertise shone through as she took measures to hasten the process, ensuring no strain on my previous C-section scar. My labor and delivery was made smoother by her attentiveness and dedication. She even helped me address postpartum headaches, demonstrating her commitment to comprehensive care. Overall, I am immensely satisfied with Dr. Nagaveni's exceptional care and would highly recommend her to anyone seeking a supportive, compassionate and knowledgeable obstetrician.",

During my delivery Dr Nagaveni waited patiently through the time .. timely checked if baby is ready to come out..waited again and Done the NORMAL DELIVERY. After delivery i was treated and examined thoroughly, made sure everything is fine. Happy to be treated by Dr Nagaveni.I would recommend my family and my friends to Dr Nagaveni.",

We couldn't have expected anything better for our entire pregnancy journey. THANK YOU Dr Nagaveni.\nWe are also thankful to the staff of Disha Clinic who handled our 3 years old  brilliantly during our visits to clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My wife was 36 years old when she conceived and Delivered a Healthy Baby Boy. All thanks to Dr. Nagaveni who made the entire journey seamless and hassle free starting from First meeting with regards to trying to conceive and the Final day of Delivery. \n\nDr. Nagaveni was available all the way through. We even called her at 4am on the day of delivery and she answered the call within 2-3 rings even though she had a operation previous night and had concluded her duty around 1am. That goes without saying how Professional she is and dedicated to her work.\n\nGuess what She was the one who encouraged us to go for Normal Delivery while we were sceptical with the age. \nBut she was confident and we trusted her Process and why not as we were seeing the desired results right from first month.\n\nMotherhood Hospital Kalyan Nagar Team were exceptional as well .\n\nWe do not have enough words to Thank Dr. Nagaveni and team as we're blessed with Beautiful Bundle of joy on 20th October 2023. \n\n\nThank you \n\n\n",

Be it anything from clarifying any kind of doubts we had, she was approachable anytime in her busy schedule. She insisted on diet, medicines what not to keep the growth of our baby in healthy condition. We insisted for normal delivery to Doctor due to my health condition like backpain, and I must say her knowledge helped us time to time for having a healthy normal delivery. Where at last moment during labour I have changed my opinion to have a c-sec but Nagaveni ma'm patiently handled me to make sure I had a normal delivery. I was stunned by her commitment towards work where she attended me after delivery at midnight also. Overall our experience with Nagaveni ma'm was wonderful. I would strongly reccommend Nagaveni ma'm for couple planning their pregnancy!",

She made me feel very comfortable, safe and secure with my first pregnancy and helped me overcome inhibitions regarding the same. During delivery she motivated and encouraged me to fight till the end for a normal delivery, without her support and words it wouldn't have been easy for me to do so. Even after delivery she has always been responsive to my queries. One of the most ethical doctor I have come across, highly recommend her. Thank you doctor for all that you have done for us, truly blessed. ",

By seeing lots of positive reviews, we decided to visit Disha clinic just for initial checkup. But the way mam treated and provided guidance made us stick with her. It was the best decision. We had smooth pregnancy period even though first pregnancy was little complicated. No over medication, smooth consultation and very friendly advices. Waiting time was more few times when mam had emergency cases, otherwise it was quick. People at reception and nursing staff are also very supportive in the clinic. Finally we are blessed with baby boy. Thank you so much mam for being part of this journey and caring with utmost friendliness.",

She took all factors into consideration and explained the possible steps that we will be needing to take in our pregnancy journey.

Lab technicians and pharmacist are available at the clinic and the doctor has an ultrasound scanner in the clinic. Lab results were forwarded by the clinic staff to us without any delay\n\nDr. Nagaveni also advised us to forward the lab reports through phone rather than making an additional visit to just discuss the lab report. She was available to read and respond to test results even during festivals. \n\nOverall, would definitely recommend consulting with Dr. Nagaveni \ud83d\ude0a",

I must say the doctor was always there for me on WhatsApp. Also she used to take her time to explain things and clarify all your doubts. I conceived in August 2022 and regularly visited the doctor. Also she was always there in case of emergency or doubt replying on WhatsApp. In March, I delivered my daughter. Again during that time, she was there during my labour pain. Her team kept helping me out during my labour and she was right on time to deliver my daughter. We are thankful to Dr. Nagaveni and her team. I have recommended the doctor to my family and my friend. I'll continue to recommend her. ",

We are blessed with a Baby Girl one month back.\nI have started consulting Dr. Nagaveni R from start of my pregnancy. She has shared her Whatsapp contact and always approachable whenever needed. By God\u2019s grace I haven't met any emergency during the pregnancy but after delivery around 20 days, my baby was not fine in the night around 2:00 AM and we were not sure what to do. We called her and she guided us properly.  \nDuring pregnancy, whenever we consulted her, we always return with happy face. She gives each patient proper time, irrespective of number of patients in the queue. She provides the ***** medications.\nI have gone for Normal Vaginal Delivery. She induced and tried a lot around 24 hours but due to some complexity ended up Caesarean delivery. \nI would highly recommend Dr Nagaveni R for pre-Post Pregnancy and Delivery process.\n",

We never saw her hesitating answering our silly questions and she replies to every single message we post.\n\nWhen we reported an emergency, she promptly answered, guided us to do the right thing and she kept calling us to make sure we were safe until we reach. \n\nOverall, Dr. Nagaveni is a fantastic gynecologist who truly cares about her patients and goes above and beyond to provide the best care possible. we are so grateful to have found her and would not hesitate to recommend her to others.",

She used to give diet recommendations during her pregnancy which I don't think a lot of gynaes do. Her experience speaks for itself when she patiently explains each phase of your pregnancy.And the biggest pro - From the first visit she  said she will only try for natural birth unless there are some complications, and she kept her promise and she and my wife were like warriors in the labour room and she made sure to give all the strength to my wife and we welcomed our baby through natural birth.We highly recommend her, please trust her blindly and you'll have the best pregnancy experience.",

She is accessible on whatsapp or phone any time and gets back to us for any problem we are facing. She is very particular about the diet and excersie and that has helped me in the normal delivery. She made sure my labour went smoothly by continuously monitoring me and ensuring that it will all go well and on 27th December  our little prince was born. It was a normal delivery and it all went well by the grace of God and Doctor's expertise in this field. I highly recommend her for your pregnancy journey and I assure you that your journey will be memorable and sweet. Thank you so much Doctor Nagaveni \u2764 ",

This inspired comfort and I felt quite happy to be in her care. She honored all my odd hour requests via phone as well. Despite her busy schedule, she always made time to go through my messages and replied promptly.\nWhenever I felt overwhelmed or got nervous, she counseled me and ensured that things would be fine. One thing I have to call out is that she does what is right for the patient in long term. She constantly assured me that pain would be tolerable and it is best for me to go for normal and I am glad that she never wavered in that decision.",

She guided me through all the phases and she truly devoted time to answer all my queries over F2F consultation/phone/chat. She was there with us during all the pregnency complications I had like spotting during initial time and gestational hypertension developed during the 38th week.  And also was available during my NVD. Dr Nagaveni is a seasoned Doctor and I truly believe that she could be a great mentor for other  prenatal journeys as well. ",

Very minimal medication and with excellent supervision and care given in all regular intervals. In my 9 months maternity, I had lot of confusions of what to do and what not to? But Dr. Nagaveni has always been my side and advised the best to carry forward. She had analyzed my conditions in such a manner, even my futuristic problems where resolved without any issues. Much happy that I consulted you, and would suggest all my friends or family in the future for any gynecological happenings.",

Me being a phobia of injections and having a normal delivery is all with the strength and support provided by the doctor. \nIt has been a awesome journey with the doctor so far. She made us so very comfortable and welcome throughout our journey. Not only has she given the best advice for my health, but also she is lovely to speak with. Her personal touch and care towards a patient is outstanding. \n\nWe are so glad that we chose Dr. Nagaveni and would highly recommend her to anyone.",

It was normal delivery with epidural.\n\nShe provided consultation even during late hours in case of emergency, and always kept us in contact through whatsapp. Sometimes she contacted us herself in order to remind us for lab tests.\n\nShe also makes sure the hospital doesn't charge extra, by clearly telling me what all procedures are done, and to call her directly in case of any billing related issues. It's difficult to find such honest doctors these days, especially in the maternity industry. \n\nOverall, we had a smooth and happy journey these past 10 months under the guidance of Dr. Nagaveni. ",

During my last days of pregnancy I used to skip my routine check up, the very next day morning by 9am I will get a call from mam asking y u didn't come yesterday.... I was surprised how can a doc remember her patients schedule and gets back to us. During my delivery mam was so calm, soft in handling.

In our case, the baby has SUA (1 in 500 case) which was detected in 20 week scan, which made us a bit more concerned, however doctor ensured that we were well informed of the consequences (what can happen and cannot happen) throughout the journey. She helped me deliver a healthy baby on 38th week. I have consulted her at Disha clinic, a very well maintained clinic and delivered at Motherhhod at HRBR Layout. I recommend Dr. Nagaveni if you are a pregnent so that you can enjoy the motherhood while the doctor takes a good care of you and baby. Best wishes.",

Though she is busy throughout the day, she tries her best to message or call asap if we have any questions. In our regular consultations we never felt like we were meeting a doctor, it is just like meeting a friend.\n\nFinally on 12th Nov 21, we were blessed with a baby girl. We are extremely happy and a big Thank You to Dr. Nagaveni Mam. *** ** *** **** ************ * **** **** **** Just please go with her without a second thought, I'm sure you would have a great experience.",

We felt very comfortable. Since then till the delivery she was always helpful, would give ample time to explain all queries in details. During last days of pregnancy she would quickly respond to the call or messages and would even follow up. On delivery day, when pain started, she picked the call in midnight and guided us to come to hospital. when we reached hospital we came to know that she has already instructed the staff nurses for the preparatory steps. We really felt relaxed that we are in her safe hands. She came to hospital around 4am and conducted delivery safely. It was normal delivery and both mother and child were perfectly fine. A big thank you for all the help and care we received.\nWould definitely refer her to all expecting mothers.",

My entire pregnancy period went smoothly because of my regular visits with doctor. She gave good advises about health (diet, exercise, weight management, etc ) of unborn and mine during pregnancy. Though I didn't have diabetes, regular glucose test was asked to be done and to take certain precautions to make sure that am perfectly alright till the end of my delivery of baby. \nI used to get quick response from her through message or a phone call in an emergency condition.\nFinally I feel blessed for getting her as my doctor in my second pregnancy and labour.

Every day she was asking for my sugar level to ensure no issue to baby blood supply and heart beat,very kind enough to guide at that tough situation,she is just call away, whenever I called her she has picked my call, that's more relief for anyone when doctor is easily reachable.finally my sugar level came in control without insulin and I completed 38 weeks full term and delivered healthy baby.very happy about doctor and treatment.",

As I was approaching close to labour we had frequent visits and she was closely monitoring my health condition. Initially we had plans to move to native but she was one of the main reason that we decided to get delivered in Bangalore. We had confidence on her as we chose right doctor. She was available any time and we could approach her easily through phone/ whatsapp.\nFinally I was able to make the normal delivery as expected. We are blessed with baby boy. I have never seen a doctor who do follow up post delivery also. Kudos to you mam!\n\nThank you Doc!",

She always has a fall back plan if something does not go as per the plan. She is very clear in explaining about the diet, exercise and medication. When to include, exclude and reasons behind it. She answers all the questions, does not rush things even if it is getting late for her. A very patient, dedicated and more importantly an approachable doctor. During the ongoing Covid cirisis I and my family were worried about the delivery. Inspite of her busy schedule she always finds time for all of her patients. She ensured she was available during my labor and saw to it that I had a normal delivery. This doctor was a boon for us and helped us sail through my pregnancy journey smoothly. I would definitely recommend this doctor to all.",

She cared about me as if I was her only patient &  has answers for my every problem. As it is said \"Treat your patients as you would want your family or yourself to be treated\" - perfectly suits to Dr. Nagaveni .

Not only is she highly professional, but approachable and available 24 X 7 to answer any query or concerns you have.  Every consultation with her is like a therapy session where she clears any concerns you have and calms you down. It doesn\u2019t matter how tensed or worried or confused you are before visiting her for a consultation, but by the time you walk out all your doubts are cleared and concerns alleviated. Another thing we found really impressive was the fact that she remembered even small details from our consultation history. I want to thank and acknowledge her presence of mind and how closely she monitored my wife both pre and post delivery because of which we were able to have a safe delivery and parents for a beautiful baby boy now.\nI would certainly recommend Dr.Nagaveni as OB-GYN for any expecting couples looking for a professional, reliable and friendly doctor.",

Dr. Nagaveni handled the situation like an expert; without panicking and telling us the probable outcomes. She co ordinated with the other Ovum teams to ensure a smooth delivery. \nEven after the delivery, she came for regular follow ups for all the days i was in the hospital. \nI would definitely recommend her to all the moms to be.",

Lot of people suggested Dr Nagaveni and for my second pregnancy we wanted to see the doctor once before deciding to continue with her or \n\nnot. After our first consultation, we are very happy with the doctors explanation, patience, finer details & friendliness. Also the doctor gives lots of time for each patient, she patiently listens to our \n\nqueries/problems and tries to diagnose. One good thing about the doctor is, she doesn't  prescribe more medicines/scans unnecessary. I got IGT during my pregnancy. Doctor followed up and made sure there were no \n\nfurther complications during pregnancy. Through out the pregnancy right from 1st month till last day whenever we visit the doctor, she always gives lot of time to listen.  We are blessed with a baby girl and \n\neverything went smooth so far. We finally have found a very good gynec in Bangalore. \n\nThanks to Dr Nagaveni.",

But very few can actually predict the future problem in a visibly normal condition and take timely step to prevent the negative impact. Dr. Nagaveni is one among them.  Her second tremendous skill in my opinion is to bring even slightest dark shed to point of focus and attack it before it causes grave concern. My wife was under her treatment throughout pregnancy time and now as well,  during post maternity care. it is not possible to give all minute details in this section.  But only one thing I would say is,  her pregnancy was complicated and if Dr. Nagaveni would not predict,  treat,  and deliver the baby on time,  things could be negative. ",

Then, while having conversation with my wife, she sensed something strange and suggested to admit that day. Later on further diagnosed she found that baby already passed the motions. Then,based on the circumstances and without wasting any minute she decided to perform my wife's delivery that day only. And, finally we are blessed with the Baby Girl.\nReally thanks to Dr. Nagaveni and we really admire her and recommend all to visit Dr. Nagaveni.",

After moving from Hyderbad to Bangalore, there is lot of thinking whom should we consult and easy to reach. But we are glad that we landed in safe hands of Dr. Nagaveni madam. Madam will never miss to respond and listens to our concerns. One time we need to consult neorology doctor, when neorology doctor has some doubts then we called Nagaveni madam, she remembers all the details of our medical history and provided the inputs. We are inspired for the care she has provided. The doctors and staff constantly provides necessary care for both baby and mother. At Aster CMI hospital, the atmosphere is awesome for visitors and kids. It has almost all the facilities which is a much better choice than rushing to other hospital for equipment in Bangalore traffic. Except for the high charges on radiology scan and extra emergency charges, we are happy with the hospitality. A big thanks to the entire team especially Dr. Nagaveni , Mamatha, Rukmini, other staff and duty doctors. Keep up the good work. Thanks a lot.",

We were very satisfied with her care and guidance with weekly, bi-weekly assessment and close monitoring of blood sugar and other blood parameters. She advices proper diet plan with exercises. As a first time pregnancy, I had lots of concerns and she handled it very well with her guidance, care and motivation and made me confident. She always motivated me for normal delivery. She works tirelessly to support her patients. She is very well reachable over phone for any query.\n\nI had a great pregnancy journey with proper care and support from Dr Nagaveni.

She gave me the vibe and the way she guided me through the remaining weeks of my pregnancy was incredible. Bcz of her guidance i started to ctrl my sugar level with diet. till end of my pregnancy i dnt take any insulin or medicine for that. Her approach towards her patients is very friendly, she spends quality time with her patients in explaining the things, clarifying doubts very patiently.\nI delivered a baby boy through NVD\nAny one can blindly believe her, trust her and i strongly recommend Dr Nagaveni for all those who wish to have healthy pregnancy\nThanku mam thanku so much be a part through out my pregnancy",

Mine was quite complicated case as the baby was detected with high risk of trisomy 13 during my 3rd month NT scan.  We were very upset as I was undergone abortion after completing 3rd moth a year back as the baby had down syndrome. Though the risk was high in my current pragnency, after meeting Dr Nagaveni, we were quite happy as she gave us lot of hope and courage by sharing her other patience experience, her own pragnency  experience which was boosted our happiness to continue with my current pragnency. The most I like in her is, she will never refer to undertake unnecessary  tests and gives very minimum medications. As I was very hesitant to disturb her, I use to just message her. But she is always responds to me in no time and calls me without fail. Her personal attachment and care with patiences is much appreciated. She always clarifies all the doubts of patiences without getting angry by giving time to them. I certainly recommend  her to family and friends to consult her. ",

Like a elder sister she took care of me at each stage of my pregnancy post 7 month.\nI have thyroid and my baby was also having growth issue at my 3rd trimester, Doctor was always proactive on taking right decision at right time. I also wanted to highlight that the doctor is always approachable over call and WhatsApp.\nI finally blessed with my princes. Yes, it was a NORMAL delivery. I wanted to share that in my case the Normal delivery happened only because of Dr. Nagaveni. \nI even amazed, when I experienced her expert guidance and care on my post delivery also. It's been 10 day's now I have delivered, I feel the same comfort zone with the doctor to approach any kind of my problem related to post pregnancy. \n*** ** **** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** *** ** ** ****** ******      ",

She is always available on phone and answers patiently to all the queries. Felt happy that she prefers normal vaginal delivery and suggested all the tips and excercise that helped during the labour.My labour room experience:My water broke at 6am and I informed Doctor, I was asked to come to the hospital for a check up. Doctor had informed the nurse in prior before we reached the hospital and I was admitted.The Doctor induced the pains and the nurses took good care and helped me do excercise under her guidance.The pains got severe at 6pm and the Doctor examined again and gave medicine for cervix dilation.By 10pm, I was fully dilated. The Doctor was taking inputs regularly and was immediately available. By 10.49pm I delivered a baby girl. All thanks to Dr.Nagaveni for helping me have a NVD and the clarity she maintains in her treatment.I would highly recommend Dr.Nagaveni for all the people planning for a pregnancy and are willing for NVD.",

She goes extra miles to take care of her patient, for me she was available 24x7 on calls/texts. Mine was a complicated pregnancy with marker in NT scan, gestational diabetes, slight increase in thyroid  levels and Cholestasis. I had to go through a couple for extra tests due to NT scan markers but she made us comfortable by explaining pros and cons of each test and what will be the best for us  and helped us in making right decision. She made sure that I take extra precautions (controlled diet) so that my sugar levels were in permissible range. She helped me in consultation with other general physician when my LFT reports were showing very high values and it was difficult to find any doctor that time. She has been extremely helpful in this COVID-19 situation when most of the essentials are far from reach. Right from day 1 consultation to discharge from the hospital she was always there. She is confident *** ************* doctor, her smile brings happiness. God bless her. \n",

She was constantly updating my husband about my situation and keeping him informed.  Her personal care, treatment and her friendly character made our journey so easy. she has given the best advice for my health, but also she is lovely to speak with. Her personal touch and care towards a patient is outstanding.Highly recommend Dr. Nagaveni. We have very recently had our second child and the experience of Doctor was just amazing.Having stayed in different cities and known many doctors, this experience was very exceptional to say the least.",

There are no pointless medications or tests. I was extremely confused and anxious because it was my first pregnancy, but ma'am patiently explained everything to me and always returned my calls or WhatsApp messages for any questions or clarifications, which made me feel much better and at ease.\nEverything went really well!! All Thanks to Dr Nagaveni Ma\u2019am. :) ",

We really liked her approach that time. We relocated to different part of Bengaluru in 2021.  After the successful pregnancy kit test, we consulted her. We had a thought of going to our hometown after a few initial months. But we were sure we wouldn't find a better doctor than her & decided to stay here. Now we are blessed with a beautiful, healthy baby and very grateful to Dr Nagaveni.",

Motherhood hrbr was closest to our house and we booked online to visit. Fortunately we booked Nagveni maam .I  had no prior knowledge or recommendation for her so i was not sure what to expect. But after that first consultation till August 20th august 2022 she has been truly exceptional.  she helped us on what's app, answered our calls and was truly present throughout the pregnancy journey. We were blessed with a baby boy on 12 august 2022 and the delivery experience with Nagveni Ma'am was also great. Her greatest strength I feel is her poise and relaxed nature and her toolkit is full of knowledge, patience and maturity.\n\nThank you again Nagveni Ma'am for all your help in bringing our beautiful baby boy into this world. \n\nWe recommend her whole heartedly.",

She takes time to explain and answer all the questions we had. She is genuinely concerned about her patients and it showed when she would make out if I was stressed and would ask me what was wrong. \nDuring my delivery as well doctor Nagaveni was there through the night till baby was born. She is tough when she needs to be but all for the good of her patients. \nShe is genuinely concerned and takes very good care of her patients. She took very good care of me. Even after delivery she kept checking in on me through messages as well. \nWe are extremely happy and satisfied with her as being my doctor and the care and expertise she has showed. God bless her through all her works and her family!\nMuch thanks to her.",

Dr. Nagaveni made sure she was available even on whatsapp to attend to any queries or issues we came across no matter what time of the day it was. Unfortunately at the end of the pregnancy we encountered some complications which was quickly caught by Dr. Nagaveni and we had our baby before time. But during this crucial time she constantly checked upon my wife and delivered a healthy baby seamlessly. My entire family and my young kid would be eternally grateful to her. *** ** ************** confident and a great doctor.

Even after so many other health issues like major gastric problem, spondylitis and back pain problem Dr. Nagveni handle my pregnancy with too much extra care. She is very good in her work and even very kind as a person. Finally after so many challenges I delivered baby girl on 9th April. I can say with Dr. Nagveni it was not at all easy.",

I was diagnosed rightly for uterian fibroids and was suggested hysterectomy. what I liked the most is Dr. explained the issue, treatment, post operative effects everything in detail. surgery was done at HRBR motherhood hospital. absolutely painless surgery. The staff at motherhood were very kind and helpful. I would take this opportunity to thank Dr. Nagaveni for all her extended support. Overall great experience ",

During each visit she spent quality time with us and never hurried up.During delivery:She was available at any given point of time of emergency in the hospital. She was very kind and encouraging,calm and quick at the time of delivery and gave it all it took to make normal delivery happen in the smoothest manner.Post delivery:She suggested quite a few exercises that help in quick recovery. She attends to any issue quickly along with following up on it regularly.Overall experience:She is a great doctor to visit,consult and get treated from. We had a pleasant experience with her.",

My whole pregnancy process was very happy and smooth just because of this doctor. She did my delivery and we are so healthy. Most important thing is, she is all time available on phone to address your problems. Many doctors do not do that and I like  it here with Nagaveni. Because some times you might not be in a situation to consult the doctor in hospital and would prefer to call them. Dr. Nagaveni never was irritated for my WhatsApp doubts or calls \ud83d\ude0a. I recommend this doctor coz you can relax and enjoy the journey of your pregnancy in any complications. No unnecessary medications, do not suggest unnecessary appointments too. She cares out of box for you! :)",

Very supportive she was all along. From the first day of pregnancy, till delivery, I was given much needed support and encouragement. I am very lucky to have her as my gynecologist and finally I gave birth to a healthy baby with normal delivery.\n\nI would recommend everyone to consult her. \n\nThank you\nNeha ",

I was explained about the procedure very well. My mind was filled with questions but she clarified my doubts and gave the confidence to proceed. She was very gentle in her approach and took real good care of me before, during and after the procedure. This took place in Jan'19 and I'm doing perfectly fine today. Thanks to you, Dr. Nagaveni. I would definitely recommend her for all your gynic related problems.",
