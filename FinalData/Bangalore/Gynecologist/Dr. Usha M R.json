We got the reference of dr usha from one of the hospital admin of Bangalore who himself handles one world class hospital (other than specialist) .... He suggested to check with her ....\n\nWe started taking consultation and day after other,  with each visit our trust became stronger with doctor...\n\nShe has a midas touch.... Today we are blessed with A Healthy baby girl Who is 5days old. It was normal delivery....both mum and daughter are fine..\nShe is humble and this type of doctor are really blessings for mankind. She is honest in her opinion and consultation charges are very modest looking at her service and other corporate hospitals...\n\nMay god bless Usha and her family..... May she prosper and earn good name and fame in her field...\n\nThank you all and best of luck to all readers of my review...\n\nIf anybody wants my reference, practo please feel free to share my no",
