"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"My wife Priyanka and me started visiting her during 4th month of pregnancy.Overall I can say best maternity related consulting we got.We had our cute little baby boy on 19-sep-17.Due date was 2 October but baby movements became less by 18 SEP.So after examination dr m gowry mam suggested for induced laber as 38 weeks were already completed by that time.We were little worried ,I talked to my brother also who himself is a doctor.Then my brother also talked to Gowri mam and told me just follow whatever mam is suggesting as she is doing best what can be done and not to worry as everything is normal.next day morning Priyanka got admitted and by evening our baby has arrived to this world.
Everything we experienced here in last 6-7 months were very good.Only negative thing I can say is waiting time while going for consulting.During weekend we had to always wait for 45-60 mins atleast.Sometimes it was really frustrating but still understandable as she is the only gynecologist there and expecting mothers are more.And as having my elder brother himself a doctor I can understand how difficult their job is.
We are still visiting her for normal post delivery check ups and everything is going good.
I would surely recommend everyone to go for her.

There is a guy who sits at the counter and is least trained to do his job, as if he is doing us a favour by letting us sit in the waiting area.

Now I waited 4 times to visit the clinic before writing this review. The doctor is always in a hurry. She will not explain anything or answer any queries of her patients. I visited her for PCOD problem and I was having abnormal flow. She just wrote me medicines and that's it. Wanted to ask about the diets to follow and how severe it is. She answered none and just gave incomplete responses and waiting for me to leave. She asked me to visit her after 3 days in case the flow did not stop. When I visited after 3 days explaining that the flow has not stopped ,all she asked me was to continue the medicines or take an injections and stood up from her chair leaving for someplace. The consultation was of maximum 1 minute.
Never going back there and please avoid this place if you want to understand what's wrong with your health.

None,"Pregnant,",0,0,NO,"The doctor is a very nice lady,  doesn't prescribe unnecessary tests, etc.  But lacks the foresight. Since both my husband and myself are working, we take only weekend appointments. Only after we reach the clinic, the doctor remembers that some test was supposed to be performed in that week. We have to go for the test and visit her again in another 2 days (which falls on a weekday) and we are charged the consultation fees both the times. 
Further she doesn't explain what is happening and we are forced to ask a lot of questions to understand anything. 
Due to my age &  family history she could have very well asked us to take precautions for gestational diabetes. But she wrote the tests only in the 6th month and because of this I'm forced to prick myself for insulin shots everyday.
