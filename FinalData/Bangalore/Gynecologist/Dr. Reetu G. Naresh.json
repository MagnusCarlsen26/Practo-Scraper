She did all her diagonosis and did few tests and nailed the issue. Since i had polyps in my uterus, i was having pain n later on spotting. Few days ago I had Hysteroectomy and I have recovered in a week. Today I went for a review and Dr confirmed that I am perfectly recovering n have no aches. I am very sensitive to pain n I m happily writing this review as I have recovered from all pain n aches. Thanks to this Dr for being so kind and understanding throughout this treatment journey with her.",
