I consulted Dr. Madhavi Reddy mam from the starting of my pregnancy career and labour. She is highly skilled, very humble, very friendly in nature and she can understand patients situation very clearly and she even responds to patients problem through watsup very thoroughly. Actually i have planned for c section delivery due to the fear of labour pains but mam suggested me to go for normal delivery and also she explained very well about the painless delivery and other types of deliveries. She has more patience and she supports me for normal delivery for one and half day and I delivered a baby girl through vaginal delivery with the support of only Madhavi mam and also mam counselled about the post delivery caring. Because of Madhavi mam, i recovered in 5 days and I am doing my normal works happily. I would highly recommend Dr. Madhavi Reddy mam for my friends and family for their better future.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"It was that day when my husband and I were on cloud nine as I tested positive for pregnancy. It was indeed a joyous moment and it was the time to choose the best Obstetrician to ensure the whole course of nine months of tenure and delivery of our child is in safe hands and then Google suggested us Dr. Madhavi Reddy.

So we consulted  Dr. Madhavi Reddy and I must say we  instantly knew we made the right decision; she is the best. She is a very good listener, spends lot of time interacting and listening to her patients and gives practical advice, very down to earth person and last but not the least very highly qualified in terms of practical experience. She ensured both mother and baby were doing good whenever we went for routine check-ups.

Days flew by, months passed by, it was October 16th (around 9 PM) I started getting cramp like pain and I knew our baby had started making her way to this beautiful world. I waited till early morning of 17th October and then we messaged Dr. Madhavi Reddy (despite of early morning) and she replied and told us that she will reach out to emergency duty doctor. We reached hospital around 7 AM on 17th October and I was admitted without any hassle. The duty doctor visited us immediately and confirmed that I was already in labor and dilated by 3 cm. We were really excited and at the same time a bit scared. This was that time it seemed the time was in slow motion. Dr. Madhavi Reddy visited us at around 9.30 AM, spoke to us and gave courage as she told us that she will be going ahead with normal delivery (based on her experience and as there were no complications she knew the best). Slowly I started getting pains on and off. Finally when it was the time to push, the real adventure started.
Dr. confirmed that the baby is almost there and it was just the final push which was required from my end. Time was moving slowly and I was not able to push. Dr. Madhavi Reddy motivated me and assured that this was the last push which needs to be made. 
Thanks to Almighty and Dr. Madhavi Reddy for the support and motivation, that final push was made and our little darling princess was delivered safely and healthily. It was a memorable and beautiful ride inside the labor room, only because we had Dr. Madhavi Reddy beside us and it was the smoothest without any hurdles or obstacles. 

I could bear all the pain and was enjoying this journey only because of the courage Dr. Madhavi Reddy gave me, along with the jokes we were cracking on labour bed.

A big thanks to Dr. Madhavi Reddy for ensuring the safe delivery and taking care of me and our little one throughout the course of nine months. We definitely owe Dr. Madhavi Reddy for everything that she has done for us and for our little one. HEARTFELT THANKS !!! 

From being a girl who was scared of hospitals, needles, pain and blood to giving birth via normal delivery, is indeed an achievement for me and it was only because of Dr. Madhavi Reddy's motivation and support. From the first day I met her to till the day I went into labour, she always encouraged me for normal delivery and all because of the trust she gained by her experience I could make up my mind for normal delivery.

We strongly recommend Dr. Madhavi Govinda Reddy to all the mom and dad to be soon couples. She is the best in Obstetrics & Gynaecology. With her level of experience and knowledge you will definitely be in safe hands. No second thoughts or doubt about it.",2024-01-14 18:10:42,False,True,Sneha,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Exercise,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I am Gritika Jena, a BDL at One Source, Kasturi Nagar,  Bangalore conceived my first child in last week of April 2021.  I was having no knowledge regarding Matrimony Hospitals at Bangalore, since I had moved from Chandigarh to Bangalore in March 2020 after my marriage.  My  in laws who are staying here since last 20 years and they wanted me to choose the best matrimony hospital at Bangalore, having good reputation.  They proposed some names and advised me to check and finalise the Hospital after checking their reviews.
We made enquiries from our neighbourhood, who just had recent deliveries and also searched through internet and finally decided to have delivery at Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar.  Also regarding choosing doctor who will take personal care and advise is also a challenge.  After going through the panel of doctors, I decided to choose Doctor Madhavi Reddy to look after my case.  Here I confess that my choice of choosing Doctor Madhavi Reddy was call from my sixth sense and God’s advice which proved to be so rewarding and worthy which I can’t express in words.
From the very first day on 14th June  2022, when I met her and the way she consoled me and treated me as if I am a member of her family.  Being the mother of first child, I was clue less about the whole process of delivery, that too at the time of COVID 2nd phase.  She handled me in such a personal bonding that I never felt that She is my doctor and I am her patient.  I was in a mindset that most of the hospitals used to carry out C Section rather than going for normal delivery.  From very beginning of my interaction with her, she  advised me to carry out normal delivery, but I was not believing her words.  Also my case was a little bit peculiar, as the position of the child was not normal till the last check carried out on 20th  January 2022, but she consoled me not to lose hope of normal delivery.  
On final day, that is on 24 January 2022, I reported to the hospital for delivery, though there was no sign of labour pain. But after checking, they admitted me for delivery in the afternoon.  Doctor Madhavi Reddy consoled me of having normal delivery and told me to try for that.  Though, they had lost the hope of normal delivery may be due to abnormal position of my child and the 2nd problem of stoppage of internal secretion of delivery fluid, but they tried their best to have a normal delivery.  A team of five doctors and nurses tried their best and finally at 11pm I delivered my first child a beautiful baby girl child and that too in the process of normal delivery.
I will never forget Doctor Madhavi Reddy for her invaluable help and guidance in the process of having my first baby and I thank and admire her and the whole team of Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar in helping out me.  Not only Doctor Madhavi Reddy, but the whole other staffs at Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar are very helpful and duty bound.  To mention one more name Mrs. Rama, who was looking after the Insurance claim and billing procedures, helped me a lot. Insurance from my first Insurance Agency completed on 10th January 2022 and my employer changed the Insurance Company and I could manage to get virtual insurance card on 21 Jan 2022, but still she coordinated with the Insurance Company and helped me getting the Insurance amount by the time I was discharged on 26th January 2022.
I will never hesitate to advise the all potential mothers to choose MOTHERHOOD Hospital, Kalayan Nagar as their destination and Doctor Madhavi Reddy as their personal doctor.
Thanking you.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy Scan,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We got to know about Dr Madhavi Reddy after doing a lot of research online and going through some reviews as we were mainly concerned on having a  normal delivery and based on the reviews we felt she would be the right doctor for us and hence we started our pregnancy journey with Dr Madhavi Reddy.

She was a very patient listener and guided us throughout the journey.
Since this was my first pregnancy and
There have been times where there were emergencies or multiple questions in my head  Dr was always available and made us feel safe.
She was very cool in handling things and always made us feel that pregnancy or giving birth is not something to panic about or be scared of and made us enjoy every moment of our journey.

When the time came and when we knew that the delivery was going to be in d middle of the night, Dr told us don’t worry I will surly b there,
They were checking on me time to time and Dr made me feel i was in safe hands.
However at one point we were confused if this would end up being a c section and not a normal delivery, considering that how most of the people end up with C sections in today’s world how ever Dr Madhavi Reddy proved us wrong and helped me have a normal delivery 

Also post delivery Dr  had been checking on me frequently to ensure that I was doing fine and feeling comfortable.

Thank u doctor for giving us a memorable pregnancy journey and always being there for us, we feel very blessed to have u as our doctor.
I would strongly recommend anybody who is keen on having a normal delivery to kindly reach out to Dr Madhavi Reddy (who is at motherhood hospital HRBR layout) I’m sure u will be in safe hands 🤗

She was a very patient listener and guided us throughout the journey.
Since this was my first pregnancy and
There have been times where there were emergencies or multiple questions in my head  Dr was always available and made us feel safe.
She was very cool in handling things and always made us feel that pregnancy or giving birth is not something to panic about or be scared of and made us enjoy every moment of our journey.

When the time came and when we knew that the delivery was going to be in d middle of the night, Dr told us don’t worry I will surly b there,
They were checking on me time to time and Dr made me feel i was in safe hands.
However at one point we were confused if this would end up being a c section and not a normal delivery, considering that how most of the people end up with C sections in today’s world how ever Dr Madhavi Reddy proved us wrong and helped me have a normal delivery 

Also post delivery Dr  had been checking on me frequently to ensure that I was doing fine and feeling comfortable.

Thank u doctor for giving us a memorable pregnancy journey and always being there for us, we feel very blessed to have u as our doctor.
I would strongly recommend anybody who is keen on having a normal delivery to kindly reach out to Dr Madhavi Reddy (who is at motherhood hospital HRBR layout) I’m sure u will be in safe hands 🤗

I visited Dr Madhavi in 2nd month of my pregnancy. Heard from a friend about her and we decided to meet her. I should say it was the best decision we made!

For the skeptical person I am, I was wondering why there were only good reviews and none bad. Now I know why I couldn't find any bad review. We always say doctors share the grace of god and indeed I saw it throughout my pregnancy, even in the delivery room.
Anyone looking for a blissful pregnancy should definitely consult dr Madhavi. A dedicated  professional, you never feel that you are in a docs chamber. She is like a friend and listens to every minute detail and makes sure you leave her chamber in peace and with a clear mind. 

She never prescribed any unnecessary medications or scans. I was diagnosed with  gestational diabetes. She made sure I could control it with diet instead of putting me directly on medication. Though I was ahead in my due date cos of diabetes, she encouraged me for normal delivery.

The calmness she has reciprocates all around and you instantly feel comfortable. I can say this because I felt it during delivery, I could see myself progress through the highest pain in a womans' life with ease and all this because doctor was by my side reassuring me of the remarkable progess I was making and motivating me to keep calm and stay relaxed through the whole process of normal delivery. 
We all dread the final day, but mark my words, for a first time mom like me it was a piece of cake all cos dr Madhavi was my consultant. The ease with which she performed the nvd, it showed her prowess. Its all cos of Madhavi mam that I have my son safe in my arms now!

I suggest all expecting moms to definitely consult Dr Madhavi Reddy. Its not always the years of experience that count but the godliness in a person**** ******* *** ** ** **** **** * **** ** ****

She quietly listened to me, that is d best thing about her, she listens to what to say, she is always available for her patient either on phone or what's app, she is also very patience. She is very practical no fuss at all. This worked prefect for me being a first time mother n me being a impulsive person she knew how to handle me n explain each n everything without any hesitation. Then d time came for my delivery that is on d 12th October 2019, I came for a regular check up n knew something is gonna happen n my bp went pretty high 150/100. Dr told I will be delivering today since is bp is very high n it might be high risk. U won't believe she is an angel she made sure I only go for normal delivery. My baby girl was born on 13th October at 1.28 am. None of my family members or friends nor me cud believe I opted for normal delivery.

After searching lot of in Google, and saw good ratings decided to go  motherhood hospital hrbr layout.. and visit to Dr. Madhavi redddy.. 
Initially it was ok.. but for *** ****** scanning too much of time waiting in the hospital even though we booked an appointment but in the hospital we waited long time.. thought 1 r 2 times may happen but every time same case.. I hve infmed in reception but no use same reapets
Coming to doctor, becoz of covid restriction they are not allowed me(only my wife allowed) inside doctor room. After 2 months I was asked and went to ask for any complications she said everything ok but some internal bleeding is there tht will cure.. I asked for any future problems she said no.. 
Every month we are visiting she was telling no issues at all.. did all the tests ** *** **** *** *** ******** * *** she told everything is ok.. 
When 28th weeke we scanned she said baby is not gaining weight.. nthg problem it will improve she said.. she asked for some blood test we did and sent report via whtsapp(after paying lot of money we have to send reports directly to doctors). 
She said BP may build up, am clearly asked any medication she said no, after week of this one night BP went full high.. at night 11 I visited to hospital.. they said need to admit but doctor dint come upto moring 11am.. in between they duty nurse or doctor am not sure, she s telling in front of my wife if this continues we have to deliver baby.. all of sudden we got shock.. moring doctor madhavi reddy came, same thing she told bocz of high BP.  I hve asked her to do something she directly telling no we have to operation.. she was telling we cnt evn wait for 2 hrs.. I decided to take 2nd opinion from out side.. they r letting me to go.. at last I hve argued and made discharge.. for one day they charged 35k.. after that I visited some other hospital **** **** ** ******* *** ***** * **** ***** ** **** ***** ***** **** **** ***** *** ****** **** ********** **** ** ********* ******* ** **** **** **** *** *********

This reply is for everyone should know both sides of the story.

Routine scans done showed fetal growth restriction. Throughout her visits BP was normal. I want you to show me if there was any documented BP reading which was high when you have visited me. On 11th nov when she met me for routine check up her BP was normal but she had swelling in legs hence urine albumin was done which showed 2+ and advised them to monitor BP daily. On 18th nov they message me at 10:02pm that fetal kicks not felt and advised them to go to Hospital immediately. On arrival BP was very high and hence started injections to bring the BP down. Growth scan showed Doppler changes, and fluctuating BP with imminent signs suggested for delivery to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Since they wanted 2nd opinion we discharged them with a referral letter. 2 days later Surgery was done for the same reason and mother developed complications and was admitted in ICU. This was the complications which I had told them and delivery was asked on the same day. No doctor will give BP tablets for normal BP reading for the predictions of preeclampsia Tab ecosprin was given as per all the text books.",2021-12-27T13:34:12+0000,Dr. Madhavi Reddy

At 29th week, she detected that I had a short cervix and suggested for emergency Cervical Cerclage , thereby avoiding dire consequences like pre term delivery or miscarriage. Having suffered a miscarriage earlier, this was most precious pregnancy. I was able to pull thru til 37 weeks and then due to polyhydramnios and baby weight being higher, pain was induced. Had quite a painful and long labor and in the end almost it was decided to be a C sec. However Dr Madhavi and her team kept motivating me and pushing me hard for normal delivery. Moment she delivered my baby girl with help of forceps, she ran and went to my mom to convey that baby was fine and she immediately was back in OT.

The best part was her friendly and understanding nature. Throughout the 9 months of my wife's pregnancy, we never felt like we were visiting a hospital.

From all the check ups to scans to coming early in the morning to be there for her delivery, she was a source of strength to us. Even after the delivery, she let my wife be herself without imposing too many restrictions and took really good care of her.

She is very patient,calm and friendly. She gave her contact number in case of emergency (which I had not got from my previous doctor).

After visiting the hospital my contractions were not strong enough.She suggested to go back home n come back when pain frequency increases or water breaks or I can't tolerate pain. 

Next day my pain increased, I got admitted at afternoon. She visited me immediately. I had 2 fibroids and amiontic fluid levels were quite high. Other doctors I consulted had told, with fibroids it would be difficult for normal delivery. She never scared me or told such things. 

For next 10 hours she kept on visiting every one hour or two. Sometimes she was asking the duty doctors to send a video of the NST. This was when my baby's heartbeat started showing low after giving oxytocin.At this stage other doctors would have gone for c - section. But she stopped oxytocin and gave me oxygen mask n tried if that showed any improvement. Yes it did. 

Even after that my cervix was not diluted enough and the baby was still in -3 position. It would have needed another 8 hours of labour. She was ready to wait for such a long duration. Luckily when she came at 10pm , cervix was diluted enough and baby was in the right position for delivery. Within half n hour the baby was delivered normally.

She tries 100% for normal delivery. I strongly recommend her.she is very friendly and open to all our doubts.

First child was normal delivery but with lot difficult communication with doctor.  So we were worried this time. 

We searched many doctors from many hospitals around and finalised to see Dr Madhavi Reddy.

 She understood and guided us through pregnancy.

In last stage, we visited frequently but she checked baby health and ask us to decide when to get admitted.

 Even in delivering day first we decided to go home and wait for normal pain but before leaving labour pain started and then went for admission. 

She gave us lots of confidence and we were relax because she treated us professionally.

I recommend her without thinking twice.
