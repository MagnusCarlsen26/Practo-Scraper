"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Ovarian Cyst Removal,",0,0,YES,"It’s practically impossible to put this in a few words, therefore I’m going to summarize this as concise as possible. My wife had been suffering from severe pain due to an ovarian endometriotic cyst. We’ve consulted numerous Doctors in Bangalore, but couldn’t narrow down to anyone due to various reasons such as – trust, intention (financial or service minded approach) etc. We almost gave up until we decided to check one last time, at Aster CMI Hospital, Hebbal. Turned out the best decision we ever made. We went through Dr.Chetana V’s profile on Aster and Practo, and felt the need to pay a visit. The very moment we stepped into her consultation room, without even uttering a word, we knew Dr.Chetana is THE ONE! So calm, composed, intelligent, assuring – I’m lost for words to describe her sheer brilliance! My wife and I were wondering why in the world did we explore all of Bangalore when the answer to all our worries was just 7kms away from our home! Dr.Chetana described my wife’s condition in detail and exact steps to address it. She is so experienced and skilled that with a look of her reports, she knew exactly what she was dealing with, and the precise actions needed to resolve it. We were stunned by her brilliance! Dr.Chetana has a wonderful team of Junior Doctors and nurses at Aster Hospital who work exactly in sync with Doctor, further enhancing our wonderful experience. The Junior Doctors under Doctor Chetana, sisters, nurses, housekeeping staff etc..literally everyone in Dr.Chetana’s team who fall under Aster’s ‘Birthing Center’ need to be applauded for their service minded approach and sincere concern for their patients. I’m yet to see any hospital or Doctor meet these standards, it’s just mind-blowing! Doctor Chetana and her brilliant team treated my wife’s condition via laparoscopic surgery. The surgery was so perfectly done that my wife woke up and started walking the very next morning! Dr.Chetana is a miracle, a TRUE MIRACLE! We have no words to express our gratitude to everyone at Aster. Therefore, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a huge appreciation email to the COO and Head of OBG (Aster CMI Hospital), where we will be detailing every task performed to the tee of each person/team within Aster, which made my wife and I gaze in awe! Our heartfelt gratitude again to Dr.Chetana and Team. The service we received is a game-changer and inspiration for not just Karnataka, but for the entire nation to witness of how EXACTLY the health care industry in India should be!
