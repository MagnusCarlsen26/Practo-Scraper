,,0,0,YES,"We have been consulting Dr Charishma since April 2023 and delivered our baby on 7th of December. Both mom and kid are doing good without any  complications. Since it's our first baby, we have questions and insecurity. But under her guidance we have passed this time successfully. She always calm and also provided honest guidance. Our two trimesters went smooth but in third trimesters, there was complications. My wife has got some infection. So, there was a chance of pre term delivery. But with the support and guidance of Dr. Charishma we reached to term pregnancy. We are very thankful with heart to her.  She was always reachable in case of emergency.",2023-12-15 16:57:49,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
