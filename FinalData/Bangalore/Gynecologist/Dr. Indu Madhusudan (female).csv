"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Fertility Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We went to Dr Indu for infertility issues, and hSG x-ray scan. We found Dr was very friendly and clear most of our doubts, we had a long discussion with Dr about our options etc. 

While coming to hSG x-ray scan it was done with great care under Anesthesia, we were happy with it. 

Regarding fertility, this hospital is very far, so we are already consulting other Dr nearby. But I get very positive vibes from Dr Indu, and found her very friendly and helping.
