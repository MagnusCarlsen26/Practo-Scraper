She is very detailed oriented and give good amount of time to listen to the patient. Difficult to find such doctor in Bangalore. She look at all aspects of the patient (specially we much required for pregnant women) and then suggest the medicines. This gives women not only the medical support but emotional support as well. She gave her mobile number to consult her in case of any emergency. This is very rare in Bangalore where you don't get any contact of doctor and hospitals charge hefty amount for emergency consultation.\n\nMoreover, we had a bad experience with one of the doctor (very famous on internet) in CA, Hebbal who practically failed to deliver the quality consultation. Then, after such bad experience we were advised to meet Dr. Chitralekha D. After 1-2 consultations we started getting the sense that we are in the safe hands. Indeed, she proved it with safe and smooth baby delivery. I strongly recommend her.",

Her decision and urgency with which she attended  was excellent. My 23 hrs journey of labour and delivery is sweetest memory coz of Dr chitralekha. Many thanks to her.",

She is very detailed oriented and give good amount of time to listen to the patient. Difficult to find such doctor in Bangalore. She look at all aspects of the patient (specially we much required for pregnant women) and then suggest the medicines. This gives women not only the medical support but emotional support as well. She gave her mobile number to consult her in case of any emergency. This is very rare in Bangalore where you don't get any contact of doctor and hospitals charge hefty amount for emergency consultation.\n\nMoreover, we had a bad experience with one of the doctor (very famous on internet) in CA, Hebbal who practically failed to deliver the quality consultation. Then, after such bad experience we were advised to meet Dr. Chitralekha D. After 1-2 consultations we started getting the sense that we are in the safe hands. Indeed, she proved it with safe and smooth baby delivery. I strongly recommend her.",
