She carefully monitored my wife's health, regularly conducted thorough check-ups, and performed necessary tests to ensure the well-being of my wife and my baby. As the due date approached, My wife felt fully prepared for labor and delivery, thanks to the extensive guidance and information provided by Dr. Deepamala.  She took the time to explain the entire birthing process, discussing various options and ensuring that my birth plan aligned with my preferences and medical requirements. During the last growth scan (38 weeks), we got to know that the there was a single chord covered under the neck and which is holding the baby's head to move to pelvis region and she clearly explained to my wife not worry too much and be relaxed. Then she patiently answered the questions related to the issue , provided encouragement, and ensured that my comfort was prioritized throughout the entire process. When the big day arrived, we went to hospital around 7.30 pm and Dr. Deepamala asked the staff to shift my wife to the labor room as the doctor wants try for normal delivery first before she attempts the C-section. Dr. Deepamala is an absolute Rockstar. Her calm and composed demeanor, coupled with her expertise, guided my wife through every stage of labor, making feel safe and supported. Overnight, Dr. Deepamala monitored my wife's condition by calling the staff and next day Dr. Deepamala  is present in the hospital at 6 am and the moment my baby was born, I was overwhelmed with joy and relief. Dr. Deepamala skillfully managed the delivery, ensuring both my baby's and my wife's safety. Her attentiveness, expertise, and quick decision-making skills were truly remarkable and played a significant role in a smooth and uncomplicated delivery. Me and my wife will be forever grateful to Dr. Deepamala for her exceptional care, professionalism, and dedication.

My first trimester was a bumpy ride where i got spotting pain and what not she gave me injections and every time I visited her her smile made me more confident and positive. During my third trimester sometimes I use to feel less baby movements for that she use to call me and check how I am feeling. I never saw any doctor calling her patient to check there well being. She is just amazing. During my 37 th week I got lose stool which we got to know later was due to Covid. She delivered my baby immediately. I was very scared that being Covid positive I should not breast feed my angel but she again gave me the boost I needed and I continue breastfeeding. Now my baby is 1 month old.

She is intelligent, calm, helpful and compassionate. Her approach towards every pregnancy stage was very natural; be it diet or medication. Every pregnant woman is different and she knows it very well as she handled my wife’s issues uniquely and accurately.
Each time we go to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She pays attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity. As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions/issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding on WhatsApp every time; be it day or night. This helped us a lot throughout our pregnancy.
Coming to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. We thank you, Dr. Deepmala, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything, you have a lioness’s share in the joy that our baby’s birth has given us.
