"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"
We have been consulting Dr Poornima Gouda in Cloundnine, Whitefield, Bangalore, since early pregnancy, Oct’20, and delivered our second baby on July 14th’21. Both Mom and kid are doing good without any complications. Thanks to Dr Poornima for supporting the Normal delivery as per our wish. However overall our experience at cloudnine Whitefield was horrible and I am listing a few instances here,

Nurses – The capability of supporting nurses is not up to the expectations per our experience, an example - the nurses did not bother to connect the NST device properly (that checks the baby heartbeat and pain before labour) until I noticed and informed them.
The nurses did not come at regular time/ or instruct upfront on the medications, a few time we had to call them to check (like tablets to take before food/after food)
The Duty doctor was very arrogant (on duty 13th Jul’21 nigh) – When we enquired if my wife could get Epidural because the pain at some point was intolerable, she commented sarcastically like you want a normal delivery without any pain huh?
The nurse as well apparently told duty doctor that we have been telling them how to use the devices (from point#1) the duty doctor then shouted at me & my wife that nurses know how to use devices better than us et.al, It would have made some sense if duty doctor had the mind to understood the problem that we tried to point out about the nurses..
The duty doctor also mentioned that she has been tired of treating many patient throughout night.. however for us it’s our only baby and delivery for lifetime, if she is tired of work she should probably inform her superior doctors et.al and not use the patient /my wife to relive all the anger, who is been at the peak of labor, just for asking if epidural could be administered!!
The duty doctor than called the gynecologist(Dr. Poornima gowda) and told that we are demanding for epidural et.al which we never did (we did enquire but did NOT demand), obviously she was trying to make some points on her side..
After the delivery my wife was still in tears because of the way the duty doctor mentally harassed her while she was in labor room..
It was not over yet.. the nurses gave bath to my wife in cold water(at 6:30am), when she said the water is very cold, the nurse threw the mug away and kept her waiting.. can’t further describe..
Yes, as patients we may ask more questions in a critical time(because it’s one time instance in life and the fear of unknowns) but it was the responsibility of the doctor to handle and not yell/scold the patient at that time.
I still respect the work the duty doctor did along with Gynecologist and delivered our kid through normal delivery but I believe that does not entitle them to treat us the way they want or the mood they are in..
We had our first kid delivered at ovum hospital which was a very pleasant experience throughout and we had to choose Cloudnine hospital this time because we relocated to Whitefield, A decision that we will regret for lifetime..

We consulted Poornima mam starting from my early stages of pregnancy and till delivery ..Mam is very friendly and listens to all your doubts.

Just because of mam's positive support and encouragement I delivered normally. I can't thank enough to dr. Poornima. I told to go for c section to her but she told we will do norm delivery and now we are blessed with baby girl.

I am very happy with the mam and will recommend for everyone who want to be mom and wants smooth delivery.
