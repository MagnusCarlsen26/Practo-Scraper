Dr. Sandhya has been an invaluable support throughout our pregnancy journey. Her thorough explanations and consistently positive outlook were uplifting and reassuring. She genuinely listens and provides personalized care, ensuring a supportive and individualized experience.

I remember a time when we were consulting with another doctor at the start of pregnancy and how on the advice of my sister we switched to her, and how good that decision was. She was so warm to our needs and concerns and helped us so much. She would carefully monitor how we are progressing in terms of baby weight and Mother's weight ensuring we hit the right numbers for a successful normal delivery.

Her approach prioritizes natural methods, contributing to our successful normal delivery.

We visited her 3 months prior to planning our baby for pre-pregnancy check up and to get a feel of the doctor. From day one of meeting her I had expressed my wish for VBAC and she was fully supportive of that. Guided us through the pre-pregnancy period. I was 2 months pregnant when my husband, my son and I got covid. Dr. Sandhya Ma'am listened to all our worries, guided us and became a shoulder to cry on during post covid recovery period. She shared her direct contact number and was reachable on WhatsApp through out. Suggested diet modifications, exercises. Though in anomaly scan showed low lying placenta, Dr. was optimistic and cheered me up to keep my spirits up. However the placenta did not move up. Though I couldn't fulfill my dream for a VBAC and had to undergo elective c sec due to placenta previa, I was given a respectful and dignified birthing experience by Dr. Sandhya Rani and team. This is an experience that I'll take to my grave.
Doctor is very empathetic, kind human being who sees her patients with utmost respect and values their feelings. It was my request to have skin to skin, delayed cord clamping, and golden hour breastfeeding. All of these wishes got fulfilled only because of Dr.
A respectful and dignified birthing experience is a right of every woman. I was denied that in my first delivery at my home town. But I'm forever grateful to God for bringing Dr. Sandhya Rani to my life. Dr gave me the best birthing experience. She is a blessing.",2022-08-25 16:40:48,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I found Dr.Sandhya rani from a friend but after seeing the reviews online I went to Mam and it was a right decision.
I also got to know that during this pregnancy I was hypothyroid I also had gestation diabetes and I was also polyhydramnios.
Mam guided me very well with required medicine and required scan, she always told to be calm and take one step at a time. Once after delivery under man's supervision baby was tested completely by neonatal team to rule out any congenital anomalies in baby.
With all these challenges still my this pregnancy was smooth and I delivered a healthy baby.

In like 2 cycles I got pregnant. She guided me since the start no matter how many queries I have. At the right time she diagnosed that I got short cervix and got that stitched. She also explained me what are all the challenges and guided us the with the contact of the supporting bed too. During that time we had a regular followup with mam over phone every week and she was available in all the time whenever we needed her. After removing the stitches I have delivered a healthy baby boy through normal delivery even though my baby had cord around the neck. The best thing about her is she supports normal delivery and never let you give a thought about  c section. Even after delivery she did continous follow ups and made sure all okay till we get discharged. We were so lucky to meet her at the right time. The amount of positivity you get after meeting her is enormous as she reads your mind well and gives right words to make you feel good. She is the go to person for all your queries and can solve your issues. We are so thankful as she is the reason for our pregnancy journey without any issue and for our little prince.,2023-07-14 11:12:09,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
