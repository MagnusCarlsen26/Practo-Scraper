She is truly an exceptional doctor and I cannot praise her enough. My wife had a normal delivery on 11th Feb 2021 at Motherhood Hospital, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore and the entire credit for a smooth delivery goes to Dr. Archana. 

We feel blessed to know Dr. Archana. She is absolutely phenomenal! She is really down to earth, caring and so humble. She always encouraged my wife to have a normal delivery, right from the beginning of the pregnancy period. 

We always wanted to consult a doctor with whom we can feel comfortable and trustworthy at the same time. When we first went to her for a check-up, we found her extremely polite. She explained us all the things in great detail. She always addressed our concerns very patiently, when we visited her in person or through messages. She gave us her personal number and always responded to our messages almost immediately, including odd hours. This gave us immense trust and confidence. She gave us tremendous moral support and motivation throughout the pregnancy journey.

She has ALL the qualities one can ask for in a Gynaec. For the 9 months that my wife was under her care, we were struck by her personal and individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering all our questions, no matter how many times we asked the same question or how weird the question was 😊 . We were extremely impressed with her incredible knowledge, skills, experience and responsiveness, in terms of communication. 

She was always proactive about addressing the various physiological conditions my wife had going on, during our regular consultations. Her expertise made us feel reassured, confident and taken care of. Dr. Archana treated my wife just like her own daughter and my wife felt so comfortable and confident, having her around. 

Even during the actual delivery, she was so calm and composed and did not hurry up the things. She visited us several times in the hospital before and after the delivery. Not only that, she visited my wife whenever I requested her, no matter how busy she was. 

We had a wonderful, more than satisfying experience in our prenatal and birth journey, all thanks to Dr. Archana.
We will always be extremely grateful to her. She is truly an angel and I would blindly recommend her to everyone! Thank you so much, Madam!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"During our first pregnancy, the experience that my wife went through was very painful creating a trauma in my wife’s mind. So planning of second child was never an easy decision. Taking one step forward and retaliating 2 steps backward before proceeding. When we came to know about the second pregnancy, the fear element was superseding our happy moments. Due to having bad experience with first doc we decided to switch over. 

By God’s grace we met Dr Archana Pathak. In our first meet, we felt a positive vibe. She patiently listened to our first experience and the trauma that my wife was going through for the second pregnancy. There are no words to describe the way she explained and boosted the confidence level to go for the pregnancy. (Note: She never forced us). She explained us everything we should expect during the pregnancy tenure and how to maintain a positive mindset through out. Post our discussion, we felt a sense of belonging and well being  and decided to go for the pregnancy under the treatment of Dr Archana Pathak.

From that day till the delivery, it was a very smooth experience. We were very comfortable with her treatment. She was very approachable, listens to all your queries and explains in details, She never ask to go for unnecessary tests or medicines, always available on whatsapp for all our queries, most importantly she is very caring and understands our family commitments. 

Her treatment created a positive impact on my wife’s heath (physically and psychologically). Finally, by God’s grace and the stupendous treatment of Dr Archana Pathak, we were blessed with a healthy baby and my wife also recovered soon.

Pregnancy is an emotion. Its very rare to see a doctor possessing personal touch, care for patient as a person, respecting family values with outstanding quality of medical care. 

We strongly recommend Dr Archana Pathak to all people seeking good gynaecologist.

From the first month onwards we consulted her at motherhood hospital Sarjapur road and our experience with doctor is really awesome. Very supportive during the entire period of pregnancy. 
She was very patient to listen to the health concerns and provide suggestions on that. In the beginning itself she told us that, as my first delivery was normal she will try for normal delivery unless until there is no complications. 
When I admitted for the delivery, she came to the delivery room multiple times that gave confidence in me. When the pain started I even thought of doing C-section and asked her for that but she told there is no complications and there is no need for C-section. Around 8.30 PM she came to the labor room before leaving to home, after seeing the conditions she informed that delivery will take another 2 more hours. 
When the delivery pain started the duty doctors informed Dr Archana and she rushed to hospital around 10.30 PM and she was on time on the hospital before the delivery and I was able to deliver a healthy baby without any complications. Also from the nurses I Came to know that , As she is staying very near to hospital she prefer to be available in hospital for her patients delivery even if it is very late night. 
I am very thankful to the doctor for the guidance and care provided during the entire period which made the whole journey for pregnancy easy and happy without any complications. I strongly recommend her to all.

Initially when we were looking for Gynaecologist who can help us in the pregnancy journey. We did not know much doctors here so we used Practo to search best gynaecologist in Sarjapur area. We found Dr. Archana Pathak and we decided to go to her. From day 1 of our journey Dr. Archana has been so helpful and resourceful. She made sure to get to know us well and helped us get through this journey. 

She always explain things in layman language so that we understand what is going on and can take informed decisions. She is always ready to answer all our queries and is always reachable on mobile or messages for anything urgent. She handled our case very professionally and perfectly. With her help we are blessed with the most precious gift of our life. She has a friendly nature due to which we never hesitate to reach out to her for any major or minor queries. Not only has she taken great care of our health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. 

The main call out here is she was very supportive of us in going for a normal vaginal delivery NVD. She even agreed to our request for husband to be present in
Labour room to support emotionally. She was guiding us with patience in the birthing process which helped us deliver our baby girl. 

For anyone who is hoping to have a memorable and safe pregnancy, we would recommend them to consult Dr. Archana Pathak.
