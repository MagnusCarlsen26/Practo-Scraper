She gave us her personal number and always responded to our messages almost immediately, including odd hours. This gave us immense trust and confidence. She gave us tremendous moral support and motivation throughout the pregnancy journey.

She has ALL the qualities one can ask for in a Gynaec. For the 9 months that my wife was under her care, we were struck by her personal and individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering all our questions, no matter how many times we asked the same question or how weird the question was 😊 .

We had a wonderful, more than satisfying experience in our prenatal and birth journey, all thanks to Dr. Archana.

When we came to know about the second pregnancy, the fear element was superseding our happy moments. Due to having bad experience with first doc we decided to switch over. 

By God’s grace we met Dr Archana Pathak. In our first meet, we felt a positive vibe. She patiently listened to our first experience and the trauma that my wife was going through for the second pregnancy. There are no words to describe the way she explained and boosted the confidence level to go for the pregnancy. (Note: She never forced us). She explained us everything we should expect during the pregnancy tenure and how to maintain a positive mindset through out. Post our discussion, we felt a sense of belonging and well being  and decided to go for the pregnancy under the treatment of Dr Archana Pathak.

From that day till the delivery, it was a very smooth experience. We were very comfortable with her treatment. She was very approachable, listens to all your queries and explains in details, She never ask to go for unnecessary tests or medicines, always available on whatsapp for all our queries, most importantly she is very caring and understands our family commitments. 

Her treatment created a positive impact on my wife’s heath (physically and psychologically). Finally, by God’s grace and the stupendous treatment of Dr Archana Pathak, we were blessed with a healthy baby and my wife also recovered soon.

Pregnancy is an emotion. Its very rare to see a doctor possessing personal touch, care for patient as a person, respecting family values with outstanding quality of medical care.
