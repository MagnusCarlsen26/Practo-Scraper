"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"I am very disappointed with this doctor and I completely regret taking her consultation through out my pregnancy. 

Only her first visit was promising to us, as new parents we were very excited and had good hopes, after that all other visits very bad, she made me cry with her taunting. 

1. In my 3rd month scan, my cervix length was short, her explanation was scary.
She said: baby may come out and die (We as first time parents did not want to hear this from the doctor.

2. During pandemic time we had to contact her through whatsapp and she did not guide us to visit her every month. She used to see the report and confirm everything is fine. 

3. Like wise I sent my 5th month scan report to her, she confirmed everything is normal, as per advice, when there is emergency we should contact her(Since my pregnancy was going normal, I didn't meet her in 6th month pregnancy). Then I met her with my next scan which is 7th month scan. 
Very badly she yelled at me for the dress I wore *** *** ******* ** **** ***** **** *** ******** ** ***** ** *** ******* She treated me with zero respect. I came out crying.

She treated me and my husband as illitrate people. She wasn't giving chance to us to talk from our end. She used to stop us in every conversation.

I had zero trust on her, *** **** ******* ** **** *** *** ** planned C section to me. which we didn't agree. **** *** *** ****** *** *** said my husband ( Hello Boss, you don't understand what I am saying) the day I got paid, *** **** ***** ******* I went through pain for so many hours.

Now post deliver, I got Hernia in abdominal area, *** **** ***** *** ***** **** ** **** ****** **** ***** As a new mother I am scared to get another operation done. 

She did not help me to give leave extension letter, even after explaining about backpain, she refused to give the letter, instead she said why should I give the letter.

Not one incident, with many incident I had to write this review.
