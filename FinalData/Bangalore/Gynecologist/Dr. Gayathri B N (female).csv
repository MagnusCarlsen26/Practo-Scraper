The best thing about her is, she clears all our doubts patiently and explains everything in very detail (sometimes along with the diagrams :p) which definitely helps in calming our anxious pregnant brains and puts it to peace. She is all about staying fit and healthy through out pregnancy, encourages walking,  keeping weight in check, eating healthy, exercises, yoga, etc. She caters to all our needs and give us all the time we need. She from the beginning encouraged for normal delivery. I almost gave up and asked for C-Section during labour, she kept encouraging me and I had normal delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Like many of the readers, I also started my association with Dr. Gayathri after going through all the online reviews. But after almost a year of knowing her, we have transitioned from readers to reviewers. 

During the early stages of our pregnancy journey, we tried a couple of OB-GYN consultants recommended by our friends. However, owing to reasons like long waiting period, distance etc. my wife and I decided to check for other options in and around Begur/Akshayanagar/Yellenahalli area. Luckily, we stumbled upon Dr. Gayathri’s profile and we started consulting her in March 2021.

She comes across as someone who is very approachable and always has time and patience to address your questions. Despite meeting many patients, she very well understands that a patient has only one doctor and it is evident from the way she calmly explains every minute aspect. 

As mentioned in many reviews, we have experienced and benefited from her home remedies. She always encouraged normal delivery and suggested exercises to improve chances of the same.

In our case, my wife had a condition called placenta previa. In such cases if the condition persists till the time of delivery, a normal delivery is not the most preferable option. However, Gayathri ma’am kept encouraging us to do walking and fortunately during later stages of pregnancy, we no longer had that condition.

During the delivery, we had ‘meconium in womb’ complication. Fortunately, Ma’am had proactively identified it and delivered our baby in time.

We are grateful to Dr. Gayathri and definitely recommend her for any OB/GYN concerns.

She is available 24/7 including late nights(we used to message her for emergencies and she used to reply each and every time).
