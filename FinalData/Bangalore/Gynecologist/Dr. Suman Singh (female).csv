"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"My husband and I had first visited doctor Suman in November 2019 when our home pregnancy test result was positive. We had searched for the best gynaecologist around and her name surfaced online with the highest rating and best reviews. Right from the first visit, we were very comfortable with doctor and although I had unfortunately suffered a sudden miscarriage, doctor comforted us explaining how somethings happen naturally and sometimes for our best. After my miscarriage, I did not get my periods naturally for 5 months inspite of all my reports being normal and it worried me big time. But doctor very calmly explained to me that there is nothing to worry and asked me to lose atleast 10 percent of my body weight. She said just try to lose 10 percent of your current weight and you will get your periods. That was exactly what happened when I lost weight as suggested and I could conceive naturally after 3 months. My pregnancy was when covid was at its peak, but it was really nice of doctor Suman to have online consultations with me and I had visited her at the clinic only on my 12th week after I conceived. My pregnancy journey was very smooth thanks to her care and she asked me to register at Rainbow hospital due to which I could avail benefits of attending online classes on Labour pain and delivery, epidural, Breastfeeding and such other topics which were very helpful. In my 32nd week, we realised that my AFI was at border around 10.6 units and having suffered a miscarriage once I was worried. It was very nice of dr. Suman to calm me down saying everything is fine and it instilled a lot of confidence in me. She had asked me to walk as much as possible for normal delivery. My due date was 22nd March,2021 but on 14th March early morning I experienced water leak and was rushed to Rainbow hospital. I was induced around 7.30am and Dr. Suman had spoken to me on call to explain me the procedure and also visited me in my room sometime later. She comforted me saying that my labour is proceeding very well, asked me to take deep breaths and be positive. My delivery although vaccum assisted was very smooth as doctor explained me when and how to push very nicely.She was very supportive and encouraging throughout and helped us deliver healthy baby boy and she also joked saying dekho baby ka weight acha hai all thanks to the aloo bhujia that you ate during pregnancy :) She even played my favourite Om Namah Shivaay song for me and my baby Rudransh in the labour room after delivery :). Although doctor is very strict and professional, she has a very caring and warm side to her, always patiently listening and answering all my questions. I have already recommended her to all my friends and cousins in Bangalore. Thank you Doctor Suman for making my journey to motherhood such a pleasant experience and wishing you happiness and roaring success always :)

‚ÄúIndeed, the most treasured of the Doctors I have been privileged to meet‚Äù 
Dr Suman Singh is an epitome of perfection* ********** **** ****** ** ********* You cannot go wrong with her care and I will refer all my friends to her practice!
I‚Äôve had an amazing and seamless experience under her all these 9 months and even now after delivery. 
It started with one of my friend referring Dr Suman for pregnancy checkups and that‚Äôs when we went to see her at her clinic post doing the home test which came positive. On seeing the doctor she told us to get some tests done and the first scan too, apparently the baby‚Äôs heartbeat was not detected and we were tensed to which she calmed us and told to repeat the scan in two weeks which we did and heard our baby‚Äôs heartbeat for the first time. 
With time passing the consultation *** **** *** **** *** **** ********* ** *********** ***** *** **** **** ********** ** *** ******. With every checkup in the last trimester doc advised to walk more and more to increase normal delivery scope and we followed. 
I out of fear was apprehensive about normal delivery and insisted for a c section however Dr Suman unlike other consultants made me relax and told me to be patient and go with the flow and wait for pains and also motivated by saying that since everything is going fine we will not go for section which actually changed my mind. 
Due date was Oct 18 and since pains didn‚Äôt come till then, Doctor gave us a detailed session on 16 Oct of the flow of labour induction and how would it go. I got admitted on 17 Oct night 9 Pm and pain was induced and as per doctor‚Äôs briefing the hospital duty doctor did the needful and throughout night Dr Suman was on call with the duty doctor on how am I reacting to the pain induction. As per duty doctors I was proceeding well exactly as per the schedule and opening as required. After the morning checkup it was noticed that the baby has passed meconium (first stool) and so we can‚Äôt wait for the cervix to open completely for a normal delivery and Dr Suman guided the duty doctor at hospital to prepare for Operation immediately- this was at 8:30 Am and the doctor reached OT in 15 min ready for the surgery which was really amazing - that‚Äôs how responsible the doctor is and took the ownership of reaching hospital on time for its patient wherein she could have told other gyanec to proceed with initial setups but she was in the OT even before I reached from 2nd floor of the hospital to 3rd floor. 
The surgery was smooth n painless with Doctor talking to me and guiding me so nicely just like a family and Thanks to her and hospital team I delivered a cute baby boy. 
I wouldn‚Äôt have sat down and written such a detailed feedback unless I mean it and I‚Äôm really thankful to Suman ma‚Äôam for her right guidance in my pregnancy. 

If she weren't specialized, I'd see her for everything!‚Äù

Thanks.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy with PCOD,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I waited for 9 months to share my feedback regarding my pregnancy journey with Dr. Suman Singh. 

We are blessed with a baby boy on 27th March and we are overjoyed and extremely happy. It was a wonderful journey with Dr. Suman Singh which is really unforgettable.

She is extremely helpful, confident, graceful, attractive, down to earth, always listen to your problems carefully, give ample time to treat me and the main thing is she makes you so comfortable that you will just love her accompany. Dr., always gives us courage, a highly motivated person with great physical and mental strength and half of the problems get cured by seeing her. 

Let‚Äôs discuss my pregnancy journey with Dr. Suman Singh -  

During the initial scan, the impression of PCOD (polycystic ovary syndrome) and Low Lying Placenta was observed. We were in a lot of tensions. Dr never gave 0.1% tension to us, instead she says ‚Äúkuch nehi huya saab thik hai‚Äù. She prescribed few medicines and polycystic ovary got cured in 1st trimester only and told Low Lying Placenta 90% patients get cured in later stages of pregnancy. 

From 1st week to last day till delivery, I used to vomit a lot. During these days, I used to visit Dr. Suman Singh twice a week. She always used to listen very patiently and prescribed medicine with multiple choices. Dr always treats us with a smiling face. By seeing her all my worries and pain vanish suddenly. We get positive energy once we meet Dr. and she always gave priority to my feeling and thoughts. During my 28 weeks, scan shown AFI level was gone low 7.8 mm. When we showed scan reports to Dr, she told to drink enough water regularly, prescribed a few medicines and my next scan after 7 days the AFI level was 10.5mm.  This is all possible because Dr. helped us to think positive towards any hurdles and worries during my pregnancy. 

I was suffering from severe vomiting, frequent motion and upper abdominal pain on 14th March. Dr. Suman Singh was out of the station on that day but still, she was in touch and connected with me.  Dr said to get admit in Rainbow and she had taken care of my treatment at the hospital. From 26th March morning onwards I was suffering from severe lower and upper abdomen pain and was not able to bear it. So I called Dr. Suman Singh at night 10 PM, she picked my call and told me to get admitted to Rainbow hospital. It was a late night so thought let‚Äôs bear the pain tonight will go to the Dr. clinic on 27th March and will show her at the clinic. 

27th March - We visited Dr. Suman Singh clinic at 6.30 PM, she asked me Why you had not admitted to the hospital yesterday? Dr. told she could not sleep properly whole night as she was in believing that she can get a call from the hospital any time at night. After Dr examined me and told your labor pain had started, get admitted to hospital now will do Caesarean section delivery. We took a lot of tensions and asked Dr. What we have to say at the hospital? Dr told us with a smiling face, don‚Äôt take any tension, go to the hospital rest I will take care of everything. The reply from Dr. given us a lot of strength and mental support to us. 

I got admitted to hospital at 7.30 PM, completed pre-joining formalities and nurses prepared me for Operating theater. Dr. Suman Singh reached hospital between 8.30 to 9 PM. By 9.30 PM, I heard my baby crying‚Ä¶. When nurses showed my baby, my eyes were filled with tears. It‚Äôs the best feeling ever had in my life and it was all possible only because of Dr. While Dr was leaving from OT, I told ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and asked everything is fine right? Dr. blessed me by keeping her hand in my forehead and told: ‚Äúsaab thik hai, kuch tension nehi hai‚Äù. 

My expected date of delivery was 8th April. I am very afraid of normal delivery. Dr. Suman Singh requested many times to me for normal delivery and explained me consequences of Caesarean section delivery, but I requested for planned C-section delivery on 29th March by consulting with the doctor. 

Dr. Suman Singh has a very strong personality and salutes to her stamina. She is a great motivator and a very nice human being. Word‚Äôs are not enough to express my feelings. Thank you very very much and I will very grateful to you. You made our life complete. I would strongly recommend Dr. Suman Singh.

I was getting very stressed with the way they were handling my case and the unprofessional attitudes. One doctor told me I may have to go for a surgery Immidiately else I may lose the child. Fluid level is down and won't increase at all. Baby is underdeveloped blah blah blah. My husband comforted me and said nothing to worry as our report from dubai was very much positive . We changed to another doctor and didn't mentioned about this visit. After first check up she said everything is fine and then we told him about the first visit . She prescribed some test which we did and while test radiologist said things are alright but some concerns are there but not much. Doctor prescribed  some test and saw the report. After couple of days we went and she prescribed again same test . Luckily my husband saw and asked why again. Then doctor says oh i forgot you have done already. Then she says get ready for surgery next week. We got dissatisfied and looked all around for a good doctor who really cares for patient  and have respect to the concerns. 
I am very lucky that we visited Dr.Suman when in my 36 week. She is very caring and we liked her professional attitude and interest in patients. On the first visit we were so impressed that we decided to continue. She listined  the problem saw all the past records very carefully and explained us  with a very cool way. My fluid level went up from 7.6 to 11 in 3 weeks and I delivered a healthy boy in my 39 week with a birth weight if 3.07 kg and after one week of delivery now both of us are completely healthy. On behalf of my family I give a lot of thanks to Dr.Suman for her support; comfort and care she has shown to me. I can't imagine what would have happened if I would have gone for surgery at 34 or 36 week by following those unprofessional doctors who do not understand what stress people go through just because of there either ignorance or unprofessional attitude . I mean no offense to anyone but we are human being and common show some care and spend some time to understand the problem of the patient rather than being busy with your phone while patient with you and then giving your opinion.

Over all I recommend Dr. Suman highly and would say that she is High skilled in her profession and very much approachable and have a superb pleasant personality with a lovely smiling always while showing interest to clarify doubts.

On behalf of my family I give a lot of thanks to Dr.Suman for her support; comfort and care she has shown to me. I can't imagine what would have happened if I would have gone for surgery at 34 or 36 week by following those unprofessional doctors who do not understand what stress people go through just because of there either ignorance or unprofessional attitude . I mean no offense to anyone but we are human being and common show some care and spend some time to understand the problem of the patient rather than being busy with your phone while patient with you and then giving your opinion.

Over all I recommend Dr. Suman highly and would say that she is High skilled in her profession and very much approachable and have a superb pleasant personality with a lovely smiling always while showing interest to clarify doubts.

Dr. Suman Singh is Very good doctor. She provides good treatment which is useful for us & supports the patient very well. We consulted other doctors in Bangalore ( no patience and time to clearly listen what our problem is) and we were not guided properly, loss of time and lost hope on pregnancy. Finally, we came to know about Dr.Suman Singh from one of my friend and we consulted her. She listens very carefully and with lots of patience and guides us very correctly üíØ what to do next. Just within two months I got conceived with her treatment( no other words to express my love and joy and happiness except thanking her‚ò∫Ô∏è).Her treatment and guidance is very good and useful. Whichever scans, blood tests she asks us to do, are correct and perfect(without any loss of time and hope). Her treatment is perfect, good,excellent and if we can find any new words for appreciating her also can be added. Will be very much thank full to her life long. She supported very well throughout my pregnancy. She is the saviour. In our view whatever she tells is correct and we can trust mam blindly without any second thought. My delivery was done by suman Singh mam at rainbow children's hospital. I suggest every couple to consult her who are planning for pregnancy to get good treatment.

Yes, we did read about some of the unwarranted negativity about Dr. Suman online, but trusted our gut and visited her nevertheless. This, we believe, is the best decision of our lives. I vividly remember our first consultation - she calmly reviewed all of the reports and files from the previous doctor. She smilingly explained the entire situation and our current position. She then made sure that Archana followed a strict diet and recommended certain lifestyle tweaks to help conceive quicker - great & successful advice. From the first time we stepped into the OPD of Cloud Nine Hospital, Jayanagar, to the actual day my wife delivered, Dr. Suman Singh took charge of my wife, her diet, her pregnancy, her health and eventually the baby. I've seen a few doctors in my life, but have never come across someone as amazing as her. To describe her better, she is highly professional, clam, polite, and extremely friendly. To her, no patient is more important than the other. Amazingly, she makes herself available when you need her most - time and again displaying uncompromising dedication. We had some anxious moments during the final stages of pregnancy, but Dr. Suman's calming presence eased our nerves and anxiety. She explained the process of delivery completely, allaying all our doubts. My wife gave birth to my son on 21st June through NVD, and we are eternally thankful to Dr. Suman.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnant Women Counseling,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Based on my experience with Dr Suman Singh, * *** ****** **** *** ** *** **** ************. 
I will refer all my friends to her practice.
Explaining three major reasons, why I am saying her best:
1.	Passion 
2.	Perfection 
3.	Responsible

Passion :  The kind of passion she has for her profession, I have never seen in any doctor in my life. I have mate several doctors in my life.
My pregnancy case was complicated and stormy, but the way Dr. Suman Singh handled all the phases, I must say, without her it would have been not possible to deliver a baby.

Perfection:  When it comes to perfection, she knows what exact treatment she is going to do for patient and if she suggests some tests, she knows exactly why she is asking you to do that and she will explain you also in detail.

Responsible: My delivery was planned at 9:30 AM, but due to some emergence I went hospital very early morning and when the duty Dr checked and explained my condition to Dr. Suman Singh, she immediately asked her to prepare me for the OT.
 I would like to appreciate her that she was there in OT within 10 Mins. And its not the easy thing for any person in that much early morning but She always takes the responsibility and ownership of her patient.

There are many other reasons, why I strongly recommend her like - Vast Experience, Friendliness, availability, Confidence and many more.
I would like to appreciate, and thanks Dr Suman Singh for the treatment, just because of her we got the most precious gift of our life.

She is so humble, so down to earth, and so conscious and concern Doc, we went with so much data and problems in the late night appointment but she gave me her quality time & reviewed my entire pregnancy detail. 

Everything was going fine & suddenly one day I diagnosed by her that I have Pregnancy induced Hypertension, she prescribed me only needed medicine , which exactly need in that condition. 

My BP was not stable and finally she told my husband to admit me in Cloud9 hospital, we did the same, she monitored my condition regular and she made us understand  me and my husband the critical condition. I was carrying 34 week 2 days of  pregnancy. Me & My husband were not understanding the situation & we were not ready for emergency C section, She tried her level best to understand us.

Finally after 2 and half days of monitoring when my baby became distress , finally Doc made the decision of emergency C-section. 

In the evening without any delay she entered in operation room with her spirit and entire cloud9 team operated me. By God's grace & Excellent Dr's of cloud9 i have a adorable beautiful daughter ""Anaya"" today with this blessed life.

I really appreciate her dedication, knowledge, continuity and discipline. She never keep off her eye entire my stay at cloud9 she monitored on regular basis in day and night.

My treatment was too good during pregnancy and I delivered a healthy baby of 3.5 kgs. According to my reports,there was a risk of low weight baby,but doc made sure that I deliver a healthy baby with lots of tips . And about the delivery, though my delivery was planned,  I went into labor 2 hrs before and mam was there immediately for delivery.
I had to go for c-section only due to previous pregnancy complications and mam knew that.

We visited clinics, hospital and consulted many doctors but to be honest, it was not satisfying as its more of scary experience. We were very sceptical on the first visit with Dr Suman, but believe me, she is strict and talks straight without sugar coating, but you rarely find a caring, trustworthy and knowledgeable doctor like her. Initially she does few tests. We were wondering why the doctor prescribed test, and rather than speaking to us more, she was on another call. Later we found that there was an emergency baby delivery and she was instructing other doctors for treatment. From that point, we never questioned her work ethics. Just follow her prescription/suggestion and you will never have to worry on anything.We were having regular checkups and the day came where our baby was ready to meet us. Suman asked us to go for Normal delivery and she was confident that we can go with Normal delivery. But since my wife was little worried of few things, we went for C section and Suman got us delivered with wonderful girl baby now.We cannot thank her much for this beautiful journey and I would recommend her for anyone as there are 100 reasons to do so.",2020-06-01 05:49:24,False,True,Anusha,"You were such a pleasant patient to treat.

Why do you think its OK for you to disregard the guidlines. We have to contain crowding in the clinic and allowing attenders inside for non emergencies is not acceptable as talking also spreads the virus especially since many of you are not wearing your masks correctly.Let me tell you also that sitting for more than 12 hours per day in a N95 mask and face shield without AC or FAN is extremely suffocating....most of us find it difficult to breathe / talk for extended periods .......but am sure you don't give a damn about our life or safety.However I have to factor in many things, including sterility of my chamber,safety of the pregnant women and my staff,given that ours is a small closed space. Your daughter is a smart educated girl ,didn't need you to spell out irregular periods for her.I had another teenager just like this yesterday and they followed my instructions...both mother and daughter were very happy with the follow up discussion on the phone.So,don't blame others when you are at fault.As for the fees,please do the math properly...after deducting taxes and consumables,I get only 300-500 which is what a plumber or an electrician charges!!.....and I haven't even  factored in the huge subscription costs of the expensive software that we use for the clinic management and the digital papers ...... honestly its too less for a senior doctor like me who is almost 50 years old with a vast experience.

My First visit was in Feb'2019 when I had a PCOS,Fibroids,low vitamins(b12,D3 & CA). Dr thoroughly seen all my reports and suggested for 3months course for vitamin and PCOS correction along with diet chart, which helped me to reduce 2kgs(being a hypothyroid patient).
Then I was asked for follicular scan in Jun followed by upt test. But unfortunately it was unsuccessful for me.
Then in July'19, I didn't get cycle and visited doc again with my tsh report. She suggested for medicine for cycle(which was safe with concieve and I was not aware) and ultrasound. Again in 15thAug'19 I rushed to her with my upt +ve and was bit worried that medicine for cycle may hamper my baby. But believe me she consoled me that the medicine for cycle is safe with concieve and I was asked continued the same tablet for my first trimester.

"Value for money,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,",None,0,0,NO,"Hi,
We have gone through the recommendation and visited Dr. Suman Singh, but my problem is not solved.
On first day, had small coversation & she suggested blood test & scan, 
Second day after going through the reports, she suggested medicine for 5 days, which didnt help me. (For checking reports they charged 200 again- which means first day 500, 2nd -200 and scan & blood test - 1900, Total- 2600). And problem not solved.
I thought, she is the best to address my health issue after going through recommendations, but it proved wrong.
My viewpoints.
- Communication, people who are not fluent in English/ Hindi find it difficult to understand/communicate as she is very fast.
- Cost, it's costed me 2600 including scan & blood test( not sure if these are required for my health issue), what surprised me is that to check reports which she suggested they charged Rs.200 mentioning im visiting again. 
Though my problem is not solved, I'm afraid to visit again because above reasons and I didn't feel as friendly, as she was little rude to me when I went with one report by saying to get all harshly & told me to control my 3year old kid when he is tapping the table.

One of the most difficult step in this process was to decide who our gynaecologist was going to be. We consulted a couple of gynaecologists, however, we felt that our needs were not addressed. Later we came across Dr. Suman Singh, after the first consultation we knew we had met our doctor, it was peak of COVID, and she followed the COVID protocol to the T. We had many questions, which she addressed in a manner in which we could understand.

After every consultation we felt that we were in the safe hands and our confidence only grew thereafter. We were particularly impressed by her attention to the detail and her meticulous planning.

She is someone who needs her things in order, be it preparation for the delivery at the labor room or the medical reports when you go to her during consultation, she needs it in an order, no compromise on that, this makes sure we have double checked our reports as well. This quality of hers is what we liked the most because we knew she would not leave anything for chance.

Armed with her advice when we walked to the hospital on the DDay we felt well prepared, there came a point where she was giving instructions to the duty doctor at 3am and again she was talking to us at 8am in the morning. In the labor room when she was around, one understood that she was in-charge. Her presence of mind and timely decision making is something that we were impressed by. we have fond admiration for her for she knows what her patient needs and how to go about achieving it.

Secondly be precise in your questions and don't waste our time with unnecessary stories about where you are, where your husband is, where you are working, and where you want to travel.
You had a concern about g e r d in pregnancy for which I gave you detailed explanation, do's and don'ts and also the relevant treatment.
Then you asked me my opinion whether you could travel out of the country , but gave me two ambiguous scan reports contradicting each other.Hence I told you that you could go with the opinion of your consulting doctor as your reports were not conclusive. However you insisted that I give an opinion which was not possible.
Lastly you mentioned that you were taking an anxiety medicine and wanted to know if it was okay for you in pregnancy. You have not shared the prescription for me to know the correct name/molecule and I asked you to speak to your psychiatrist regarding the same as medications have to be continued after the evaluating the pros and cons completely.
I started the consultation at 8: 14 pm and ended at 8:34 p.m., which means I gave you 10 extra minutes over and above the allotted time to you.
In the middle of a busy clinic when the other patients are being made to wait I think it is rather rude on your part to keep dragging the consultation especially when I cannot give an opinion due to insufficient data .
Also the poor network that Practo provides makes the consultation extremely difficult and laborious with multiple call backs often which is frustrating for both. 
Mind you we are paid only 400 odd rupees for the consultation on Practo which is too less for the amount of time that we have given you.
We too feel short changed by both Practo  who charges exorbitantly for pathetic service and from patients who have unrealistic expectations from an online consultation .

One thing I would like the doctor to do is to explain in advance the possible side effects of taking the prescribed medicines to help us mentally prepare to face them back at home.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I approached Dr Suman Singh through Practo, where I read excellent reviews about her and I am quite satisfied with my decision to engage her as my gynaeycologist.

I first met her during my second month of pregnancy (earlier this week). She is extremely patient and understanding, and spends a good amount of time hearing out the patient and explaining the health related aspects; only, thereafter she allows you to pose questions and patiently addresses each of them. Even when she prescribes a medicine or a test, she kindly explains the accompanying reasons and barely leaves it to the patient to feel the need to have any follow up questions or doubts.  

The clinic is well maintained and the wait time is decent. Dr. Singh always wears a smile on her face which eases out your stress as a patient, to a great extent!

After our consultation(have closed it after one hour not in 7 minutes!!) and explaining how to take the medicines to manage your periods, then you send me multiple messages during the follow up with each message more confusing than the next. You don't even have the courtesy to write the dates properly, you are using an American system and interchanging the day and the month adding to the confusion as your message is incomplete and with every message you are wanting to use a different permutation of the medicine prescribed as per your whims and fancies. I had to spend so much additional time trying to understand your messages again and again ,finally I got fed up and I tried to call you but you were not connected on the app because of which I could not get through to you .Nonetheless I redid my prescription to suit your new requirements.

Instead of wasting your time and my time writing such a lengthy feedback it would have been much better if you had put more thought into your consultation in the first place and neatly written down your requirements when we had asked you to do so.If you were better organised the confusion and rework wouldnt have been necessary.

Writing multiple messages back to back during evening OPD hours will not help as I have only two hands to work with and the only condition on which I accept these online consultations on Practo is that I should be able to respond to them at a time that I am free ,after I have attended to my clinic patients.

If you do not have the patience to wait for a follow up response and expect an immediate response,let me inform you that it is not possible.We have been allotted 24 hrs to respond by Practo. 

You are quick to call us unfriendly(because of delay in follow up) but I just find your whole attitude towards me rather rude and ungrateful especially when I was running high temperature and still working beyond my capacity to attend to your umpteen changes in requests.

Most of you are not even aware of what you are entitled to in a Practo online consultation and unnecessarily keep ordering us to call you back which is also out of line.

Fed up with the unreasonable demands that people have on these online consultations I have reduced it drastically to spare me the headaches of these online consultations.

I am more than happy to consult patients on my WhatsApp as I find the connectivity excellent and I am immediately able to reach out to a patient if I have to explain to her the medicines or at least leave voice messages for her to hear at her convenience",2022-11-15T16:25:49+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

Nonetheless I had answered all the questions that you asked.Am actually surprised by this review.Sometimes when a patient looks uncomfortable ,we may put off further probing to a subsequent session to reduce the awkwardness.

Since the main concern that you presented with was lack of libido I took a complete history and then asked you to do a few blood tests including a thyroid test near your place Indiranagar itself and I also explained to you that I need to first ensure that you are otherwise healthy before looking into the psychological reasons for reduced libido.

Since you mentioned that you had painful intercourse almost as if something was blocking the way, I told you to also do a scan to rule out  PID/ endometriosis and other causes which are common for painful intercourse.I also asked you to come and see me in the clinic so that I could examine you properly and evaluate the reason for the difficulty in having intercourse and rule out vaginismus/vaginitis/rigid hymen etc.More so since you were still unmarried I  didn‚Äôt want you to be hurt or develop a phobia due to a painful experience hence thought to examine you before writing any medication.

Appears to me that you were looking for some stopgap treatment and not a detailed evaluation.

Some patients try to hoodwink us by claiming it to be a free consult when it's not and so obviously get caught when the opd notes are shared. This patient was seen on 12th in Rainbow and despite being told to meet me directly with all the reports, decided to show me only scan on 12th and do a follow up on the phone on 15th for the blood reports; which I did without any charge as per rainbow policy.Since she was persistently anemic I had asked for a Hb electrophoresis to rule out thalassemia trait (medically required as thalassemics can't be given iron injections and also to rule out potential fetal problems). Now on 19th she again wanted me to do a free consultation which was out of place. Finally after sending me 9 msgs on my whatsapp she ordered me to give prescriptions on practo online consult which is registered under her husband's name,not her name... Hence I told them to stick to one portal for consultation as it's very time consuming and confusing to treat on 2 portals and maintaining records is difficult.Finally I got fed up with their attitude and cancelled their payment and refunded their money back to them.

We have time and again requested patients to come 15 min early to the reception in order to finish weight and BP check so that they are on time for our consultations.I usually finish my opd before I go to the OT unless there is an imminent delivery or dire emergency which is understandable.",2020-05-20T15:38:28+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

",2019-08-01 09:56:46,False,False,Verified Patient,"We never charge for reports shown on the same day.

We have kept our initial consultation low because there are many general patients also who come and they do not need a revisit. Also after first consult, we always try to write test requests well in advance in order to complete check up and report review in the same sitting itself to avoid follow up wherever possible. 

2% is the charge levied on us which the bank has authorized us to pass on to clients since the machine is used by you and not me. I cannot be taking the burden of the bank charges for there are many injections which we give much below MRP and obviously I can't be paying for your treatment from my pocket.You can always pay by other means where there is no extra charge. 

If a pregnant patient calls in the night with pain, how am I supposed to know the cause without examining.? Moreover phone consultations are banned by law. Hence we request patients to go to the hospital and the registrar will see and inform me.

Hence told her to repeat the beta hcg again and if less than 25(i wrote the value also on the lab request form) she could take the regesteron tablet to induce the period and see me with prescribed blood reports to induce ovulation properly again in order to achieve a pregnancy. I may be fast in my work but you must understand this is very basic for me.

You called practo later and when the hospital got the appointment call they immediately confirmed the appointment and sent you the message. So the delay has been from practo and not from the hospital's end. Also you could have been more proactive and made the follow up call earlier giving you enough time to drive down.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,NO,*** ** ************** *** doesn't give any response during follow ups. I had bad wrst experience ever. I will not recommend this doctor. She is just an high priced with no professionalism.,2022-10-17 14:46:36,False,False,Verified Patient,"We are very professional and we take our job seriously and dont appreciate the wrong feedback here. Have gone back and checked our online consultation chats and I do not see anything wrong from my end. Also I am paid less than Rs 500 for a  practo online consultation.....which is lesser than my clinic charges,you feel it is high priced?? honestly for the unprofessional manner in which patients drag the consultation to hours its just not worth our time and  effort.

I have responded to all your queries , gone way beyond my expected consultation time of 10 minutes and have even patiently waited during the delay from your end in sending me the reports. During the follow up you wanted to know if a brand substitution could be done which was addressed and when that  did not suit you and you commented that you had some side effects I asked you to see me but you did not want to and instead wanted a different prescription for which also I obliged.

I honestly do not understand your  grudge against me as I have fulfilled my duties properly.

I had asked for a CBC and random blood sugar test and you haven't sent the reports yet.

You have sent some irrelevant reports which are not related to your condition or what I had asked for and so I told you clearly to do the required tests and share but you neglected. 

It is very easy to blame somebody else without understanding your own mistakes.
Also please be clear that the online consultation on Practo is for 10 minutes only and you are supposed to be ready with your details and reports uploaded before the consultation starts so that you  do not waste the doctor's time.
Be mindful that there are other patients waiting and their notification keeps coming to us as a reminder that we need to conclude ongoing consultation.

While paying for Practo you would have been aware that the follow up will be only through messages and we have 24 hours to respond to your follow up messages subject to our schedule. If you see properly I have not faultered in my consultation at all.",2022-10-19T09:27:59+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

As you are already aware and I am sure Practo also must have told you that your cashless facility is only towards the consultation charge and not towards the one time registration fee of Rs 100 which was what my receptionist asked you to pay .The practo app doesn't come free for us.We have to pay a huge subscription fee in order to facilitate the usage of their software for booking/billing/online consultation etc.This is as per Practo rules.You can always call them and verify.
My receptionist was only doing her duty and was not rude to you in any way. Infact so many patients have complimented her on her friendly behaviour.
A consultation fees of Rupees 700 valid for 6 days for a senior doctor with over 25 years of experience is very very low to be honest. 
Follow up has been done and reports were normal.One test is pending from your side after which the final discussion can be completed.Same was communicated to you during the followup.

As for the charges well what can I say Practo takes the money from you,so you can discuss this directly with them.
I see that Practo has blocked out their name from your feedback while trying to make it appear to be a complaint only about me....1/5/22...reviewed your details after procuring it from practo..you had a complaint of post coital bleeding for which you had already shared your thyroid,prolactin and USG reports and after seeing them i have clearly told you that they were normal.Have asked you to do two other tests and also visit a local gynecologist for an internal examination as bleeding after intercourse mandates this examination to rule out cervical causes of bleeding which cannot be determined on a phone consultation or ultrasound.The prescription was clearly written and the same is also seen by you.You haven't reverted with the reports.Do you know post coital bleeding can be a  symptom of cervical cancer!!how does one diagnose it without checking????Just because your knowledge of the subject is limited does not mean that we dont know our job!!!",2022-05-01T02:07:54+0000,Dr. Suman Singh
