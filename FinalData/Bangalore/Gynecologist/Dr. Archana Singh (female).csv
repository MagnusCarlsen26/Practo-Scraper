,"Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Archana singh is a gynaecologist everybody would want to have in her contact list. She’s a very confident doctor and never feels insecure about her approach or methods which makes her capable of answering questions of any sort happily and confidently. She believes in educating her patients and encourages them to discuss whatever comes to the mind, so if you’re a kind of a person who doesn’t like to follow things blindly instead likes to understand the perspective first and then follow, she’s is the one you are looking for.

Dr.  Archana is patient and understanding; she takes time to listen and explain things in simpler terms. She is approachable & her friendly nature makes each & every meeting productive. For me, she has personally set a high standard in the context of her sheer dedication & professionalism. Throughout my pregnancy, she closely monitored my health condition.  She was always available to answer my questions on WhatsApp and provided her expertise on reports to help me understand my pregnancy journey better. Owing to uterine fibroids my pregnancy was little complicated but she ensured complete support and made my pregnancy journey a memorable one. I would definitely recommend her to any women heading to pregnancy. I had been to multiple doctors in my locality, but did not find anyone who takes her patients this seriously. She is truly a great professional who works very diligently and ensures best care for her patients.

Highly recommend Dr. Archana for a stress-free pregnancy and delivery experience.
