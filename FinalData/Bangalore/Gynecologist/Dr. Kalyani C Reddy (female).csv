"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Exercise,PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Family Planning,",0,0,YES,"Please visit Anjani without any second thought. 

I would definitely recommend Dr.Kalyani for planning and other gynac-issues. I met her about a year ago for conceiving problem. And, I am reviewing her hospital after a month of my Normal vaginal delivery, with my my bundle of joy right beside me!

My husband and I decided to meet a Gynac after trying to conceive for about 6 to 8 months in 2023, we fortunately met Dr.Kalyani. I was comfortable meeting her for the first time and decided to continue visiting her. She is an amiable person. Initially she went through my history-details thoroughly and asked me to do few preliminary checks.

Dr. Kalyani attends all her patients with due care, empathy and individual attention. Please feel free to meet her and discuss all your concerns with no hesitation. I'm sure the best possible resolution would be given to you. She tracked me well through my pregnancy when my family was away and my husband stood should to shoulder. This indeed helped me take great care of myself & my baby while I was carrying.

Dr.Kalyani's approach is always quite pragmatic. My BMI was already in required range. Thereby, 'weight' was never my concern. She noted that I was slightly anemic though my cycles were regular. She suspected ovarian cyst formation as I experienced signs of bloated stomach, though my cycles were monthly/ timed. My only signs of disorder were pimples and slightly bloated tummy. Also, my sleep patterns varied too, due to IT work/ shifts. She double checked for ""PCOD or cyst formation"" and if it is in the preliminary stage. She checked if I am ovulating properly (if Anovulatory), which was luckily not my case. Later, she confirmed that my major concern was Cyst-formation and prescribed medical-aid accordingly. Mild medication was suggested to me. She told that I would see the results in few months.

Of course, she made me incorporate certain changes in my diet and lifestyle. I followed them all with due diligence. Yet I used to express my anxiety during visits. She told us to be cool, carefree and enjoy the life before carrying, which is very true. In the next 3 months, it happened as she promised. I was tested positive during the beginning of my 2nd month of pregnancy. What more could I have asked for!

She always insists NVD or normal vaginal delivery. Hence, one must be mindful about the daily intake. It should be both balanced and fibrous in nature. (Please note, BMI ratio plays a crucial part here. It could become the cause of your health concern, if neglected). ""You are what you eat"" - as the saying goes.

Her clinic is well equipped, well maintained and modular. Both scanning facility and labor facility are available here. The protocols followed here are in favor of NVD. My scans were done quite efficiently though there were errors while printing one of my scan reports. Please cross-check before breaking down like me, thinking that all the effort went in vain. There is a Physiotherapy section too. Physiotherapist Gayathri taught me useful exercises, breathing techniques and birthing ball exercises from 36th week. The pelvic floor exercises really helped me reduce the pelvic muscle catch. The clinic is crowded by aspiring parents, but the labor unit is kept separate (yet interconnected) and conducive for delivery. This helped me walk around and exercise peacefully during my labor. I was able to firmly decide the next steps of my delivery when there was some risk posed at me.

I was very anxious about the pregnancy journey, I experienced heavy cramping in my 2nd month. In the initial 3 months I confined myself to a single room, due to extreme nausea. I was losing hope while dizziness and mood swings took over. I was unable to eat my meal (except 2-3 fruits) or enjoy a cup of warm milk, which I used to. I was unsure about reaching next trimester, if things would remain the same in future, etc. Dr. Kalyani pushed me and told that things shall pass. Yes, it did get better as she said.

The next 3 months were pleasant. I was bubbling with energy. Whenever I asked what is happening inside me, she would answer all my why's very elaborately and convincingly. I was told to maintain BMI, put on some weight (weight loss due to vomiting), take supplements regularly, focus on nutrition and eat healthy, which is always important. There were some false pains, etc, but my doctor was always available. All through my pregnancy, she has responded to my requests very quickly. She responds to both chat/ WhatsApp messages and urgent calls. She has attended my calls always, even during late night.

And the last trimester was a bit horrid due to my delivery-related concerns. ""It's all in your head"" - as the saying goes. I informed Dr.Kalyani that my family is away and could not get much help from them. I felt restless and used to lose sleep thinking of the labor day, stay awake to think about the how's. Problems were merely pondered, be it about bearing the birthing-pain, handling myself carefully until baby becomes full-term, taking care of my new born post delivery, adequately nurturing my child, etc. During one of my visits I enlisted my concerns, she gave solutions to each and every problem and instilled confidence in me to handle everything by myself. In fact, she told that it would be better to do things by self and remain active (Self-Help) than to rely on other family members. Also, when I reached the last leg of my pregnancy, she told my husband to not pamper me much. Her intent was good, so as to make me feel more responsible, deliver quickly and normally. Later, I had the same kind of delivery. My delivery pain subsided in few hours, though I slept on the birthing pain issue for months.  

At the mid of my labor, she gave me the liberty to choose NVG (normal vaginal delivery over C-section) though there was some undetected risk involved. Had I visited any other renowned hospital for my delivery, this wouldn't have been the case, I believe. We really admire the expertise with which she delivered our cord-around-the-neck baby normally.

We are thankful to the labor team for safe birthing experience. I cannot forget mentioning miss Revathi for her constant backing, great patience and assistance during labor. Post delivery, the day shift staff took much care of my new born and helped me feed in a right posture. All in all, it's been a pleasant journey with 'Anjani'. The very name is indeed powerful (she who ferverently prayed for a strong child, to beget Lord Hanuman as her son). Please visit Anjani and pass the toughest exam of womanhood with flying colors, just like Maa Anjani.

We wish you the best, team Anjani. Wish you the best, Dr.Kalyani, can't thank you enough ma'am. Wish the expecting mothers to have an easy delivery and healthy baby at Anjani :)",2024-08-07 18:50:56,False,True,Sharada,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I am writing to extend my heartfelt thanks for the outstanding post-delivery care you provided. Your attentive and compassionate approach made a significant difference during my recovery period. 

One piece of advice my doctor consistently gave to me and others was to be cautious with our diets during the last trimester of pregnancy. Failing to do so could result in the baby growing too large, leading to severe complications during delivery and recovery. I strongly recommend that every expectant mother strictly follow their doctor's advice. 

During the last two months of pregnancy, it's essential to prioritize both the mother's and baby's health. Here are some precautions to consider: 

1. Regular prenatal check-ups: Keep up with scheduled appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor both the mother's and baby's health. 

2. Monitor baby's movements: Pay attention to the baby's movements and report any significant changes to your healthcare provider. 

3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which is crucial for both mother and baby. 

4. Get enough rest: Ensure adequate rest and sleep to support your body as it prepares for childbirth. 

5. Eat a balanced diet: Maintain a nutritious diet with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. 

6. Avoid risky activities: Refrain from activities that could pose a risk to you or the baby, such as heavy lifting or strenuous exercise without clearance from your healthcare provider. 

7. Pelvic floor exercises: Practice pelvic floor exercises to prepare for labor and childbirth. 

8. Attend childbirth classes: Consider attending childbirth classes to learn about the labor process, relaxation techniques, and pain management strategies. 

9. Prepare for childbirth: Pack your hospital bag, make arrangements for transportation to the hospital, and discuss your birth plan with your healthcare provider. 

10. Stay informed: Keep yourself informed about signs of preterm labor or complications, such as preeclampsia, and seek medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"Hi Everyone, I want to share about my high-risk pregnancy experience. Because I had diabetes and was 35 years old when I gave birth, I was classified as having a high-risk pregnancy. My Hba1c was 8.4 at the time of conception, and I was rather worried about the fetal development. We went to the Anjani Hospital and had a consultation with Dr. Kalyani Reddy, madam. 

Dr. Kalyani inspired and counselled us and medications were provided. She also sent us to the dietician, Bindhu, who provided several recommendations for a diabetic diet, and to Dr. Prasanna Kumar, the diabetologist for diabetes control. Dr. Kalyani ensured that we are aware of potential difficulties, every screening step was completed at the appropriate time, and the risk was frequently discussed.

The scanning capability of Anjani Hospital is well built-in. Dr. Raja Munireddy performed all of my scans and the reports were shared on time. Dr. Kalyani madam, diabetologist Dr. Prasanna Kumar and Dr. Raja sir, collaborated and coordinated well. I took insulin the entire time I was pregnant. Because of high-risk pregnancy entails problems, I was worried about an early birth. However, with the support and guidance of Doctors a health baby was finally born at the 38th week. 

My child was delivered via caesarean section. We express our gratitude to Dr. Kalyani and Dr. Ravi, as well as the rest of the medical staff that assisted with my pregnancy care, delivery and post delivery care. I want to express my gratitude to everyone of the personnel, medical and non-medical, for the excellent care they gave us from the Day 1 we visited the hospital.

My Hba1c was 8.4 at the time of conception, and I was rather worried about the fetal development. We went to the Anjani Hospital and had a consultation with Dr. Kalyani Reddy, madam. 

Dr. Kalyani inspired and counselled us and medications were provided. She also sent us to the dietician, Bindhu, who provided several recommendations for a diabetic diet, and to Dr. Prasanna Kumar, the diabetologist for diabetes control. Dr. Kalyani ensured that we are aware of potential difficulties, every screening step was completed at the appropriate time, and the risk was frequently discussed.

The scanning capability of Anjani Hospital is well built-in. Dr. Raja Munireddy performed all of my scans and the reports were shared on time. Dr. Kalyani madam, diabetologist Dr. Prasanna Kumar and Dr. Raja sir, collaborated and coordinated well. I took insulin the entire time I was pregnant. Because of high-risk pregnancy entails problems, I was worried about an early birth. However, with the support and guidance of Doctors a health baby was finally born at the 38th week. 

My child was delivered via caesarean section. We express our gratitude to Dr. Kalyani and Dr. Ravi, as well as the rest of the medical staff that assisted with my pregnancy care, delivery and post delivery care. I want to express my gratitude to everyone of the personnel, medical and non-medical, for the excellent care they gave us from the Day 1 we visited the hospital.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I highly recommend Dr. Kalyani Reddy mam. She is a very patient, caring and practical person and tells you exactly what we need to do if we are looking forward for a normal delivery and welcome a healthy baby. She pushes us so much for a normal delivery which we don‚Äôt see much nowadays. I believe she is great doctor who really wants the best for us so just trust her and follow her advice. I have followed all her advices from the beginning! Mentioning a few of them if it helps any one of you:
1.Please give your body the rest if she tells that you need to rest especially in the first trimester.
2. We should be very mindful of what we eat! She clearly explains why it is so important to eat a balanced diet rich in fibre. So, please avoid a lot of carbs throughout your pregnancy and also avoid a lot of protein in the 8th and 9th month.You can ask her advice on the same. This mainly helps in maintaining baby‚Äôs weight. Of course we all need a healthy baby but we have to understand that even if the baby is not 3.5 kg we can still have a healthy baby. So, if we can maintain our diet in such a way that by our due date the weight is max around 3.2 kg there are high chances for you to have a normal delivery. I know there are other factors that should be considered but I am only talking about things that we can control.
3. Thirdly, keeping yourself hydrated and exercises. Walking does help but what helped me more were the pelvic exercises. You can take a session from the physiotherapist and continue to do it daily without stressing your body. It helps!
4. Please don‚Äôt panic during the delivery! I think remaining calm if possible, breathing normally and not holding your pelvic area tight is so important! Else all your efforts will go into vain because we couldn‚Äôt manage the stress in those last few hours. I did lose my calm for a few seconds may be a minute but had to pull myself back. I don‚Äôt know if this will help anyone as this was my personal hack that I saw in one of the videos. It is to use a comb to distract myself from the contraction pain during that last hour of delivery and it surely helped me! You never know it can help you too! 

Finally, I am very glad that I chose Anjani hospital and Kalyani reddy mam. A shout out Raja A Munireddy sir as well for his patience and how well he explains things during scans!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I began consulting Dr Kalyani in late 2016 just prior to and during my first pregnancy, which for unfortunate reasons ended in a silent miscarriage during the 7th week. Dr Kalyani was very supportive during this period and advised trying again in 3 months. 

Thankfully, we conceived again without problems earlier in 2017; Dr Kalyani was very pro-active in her attention towards ensuring all corners were covered this time: including regular tests and follow-ups. She was warm to talk to: professional at all times (reassuring not in a hazy/hand-wavy manner, but candid with facts, data & risks), as was Dr Ravi during our clinic visits. Dr Raja (radiologist/sonologist) was equally wonderful and made all our scans memorable. Highly recommend his calm demeanor, attention to detail and warmth during each one of these sessions.

For various reasons (and somewhat against Dr Kalyani's advise) - I decided to go back to my hometown for delivery during the 7th month. Although it wasn't intended this way, I stopped consulting Dr Kalyani after this under the assumption that I'll deliver in my home town.

Twist in the tale here: Due to rampant Dengue in my hometown (and very close to my due date) - my husband and I decided to go back to Bangalore since we found it too risky to continue to stay and expose myself to a potential infection. It was a pretty stressful day, culminating with my husband calling Dr Kalyani late night at 10PM explaining the situation to her. Honestly - we were extremely skeptical whether she would agree to see us given the unceremonious disappearance (against her advise) and the fact that I was so close to my due date: Instead, Dr Kalyani advised us calmly to return and prescribed emergency medication to keep during the travel should I go into labour during the journey back to Bangalore.

Upon return, we felt the calmest we had through the entire pregnancy. 10 days later, I delivered a healthy baby boy via normal labour that lasted all of 4 hours. 

In conclusion: I'm very happy & fortunate I consulted Dr Kalyani and followed her advise throughout. We hear about C-sections being de-facto these days: If you're pregnant / trying to conceive, my advise is that you consult Dr Kalyani - and you can be rest assured she will ensure the best possible outcomes for you and your baby (and normal delivery if it is possible at all);

Post-delivery, Dr Kalyani asked me to mention what I did right (which made labour so easy) - Just to answer that: in general, I stayed active throughout, avoided outside/junk food, overeating and did labour-friendly posture exercises  to some extent, daily 1 hour walk. Over and beyond that, it was just divine oversight over destiny. Stayed calm and positive - that's always advisable.

Many thanks to Dr Kalyani once again.",2018-01-20 17:02:59,False,True,Janani Pavan,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"My Write up may look longer but after reading this you will know why Dr. Kalyani is most adored *** **** ***** ****** ** ***** ****** ***** **** ** ** ******* **** **** ** *** ***** I would now tell you my experience and hardships in delivering a baby boy of 3.6kgs with 50 cms height. By the way am only 5.2ft !
     Me and my hubby are married since Nov 2013 yrs and we have been trying for a child since Jan 2016. We have tried for 8 months (visited couple of gynecologists but was not satisfactory) and then consulted Dr. Kalyani.  
      Our First appointment with Dr. Kalyani :  We told our purpose of visit. She was so patient in listening to us. Then she asked about our family history, maternal history and health issues and did a few tests & checks where she found that I have PCOD (previous gynecs dint tell me about this). She has prescribed some tabs for 15 days and asked me to visit after my next month period but to our surprise.. Hurrayyyy..My Pregnancy Indicator Shows Positive!!! My mind said..Whats the magic she did to me?. So our new journey with Dr. Kalyani for my pregnancy started from Oct 2016. She has good team of Doctors .Dr. Ravi, Anesthician (Kalyani Mam husband), scan specialists who investigate on the baby development based on our feedback and suspicions about our family medical background which I felt very satisfactory. Why am stressing this is because of my father who is a Cancer patient and is bedridden for past one year. After lot of discussions I convinced my mom and Dad to come to Bangalore to support me as I dint want to change the Doctor (as it was a tough task for his health condition). Now my Due date was given as Jun 16th.   During my last visit Doctor has observed and told that she shall perform delivery on Wednesday (Jun 14th) as waiting till due date may sometimes have a threat of low fluid levels. Dont know whether my baby has listened to Doctor or Dr.Kalyani was so perfect in prediction, I started getting contractions on Tuesday (Jun 13th) evening. As per Doctors advice I got admitted to Ovum Hospital.
       This is another great phase in my delivery. I was shifted to Labor ward at 5 a.m on Wednesday . By 10.a.m, pains were so severe that I could not bear and requested for Epidural Injection. There comes Dr. Ravi @ 11 a.m. to give Injection. It requires lot of expertise and he made me feel so comfortable and relaxed with his friendly talks even in that painful stage. Its an art isnt it?! Dr.Kalyani came for the final war phase at 1.30. p.m. I was trying so hard but there is no progress in the baby position and twice the baby head came and went back!!! Due to this strain, baby's heart rate dropped to 90 bpm. Then Doc gave Oxygen mask which helped in picking up the heart beat again.(In similar situation in friends case, her Doctor made C section when Baby's heart beat dropped to 100 bpm). Then sister Mamta sat on my bed next to me pushing my belly and pressuring Baby to move, Dr. Kalyani instigating me to push. That moment, labor room was like a war room with everyone trying hard to bring the baby out . Around 2.45 p.m. I gave up and asked doctor to go for cesarean. Doctor got so furious and told- Keerthy..Think about your father and family situation,Who came all the way only for you..dont give up ! That shows her concern for her patients. That words really boosted me and I gave one hard try with all my energy and its done .Great Success..Welcome to our Little cutie Boy (weighing 3.64kgs) @3.03 pm. Its normal delivery for me only because of Doctor's STRONG DETERMINATION! 
   Based on my experience and observation, few words to tell about her is - She is very cool and patient in hearing our problems and analyses every point. Based on that, she starts medication but before that she tells her views and background for doing so. She is strongly determined for Patient,s Normal delivery. 
    Today am so happy for my decision and thankful to Dr. Kalyani and am sure that anyone will have the same experience with her.\n",2017-09-18 06:01:32,False,True,Keerthy,,,
None,"Pregnancy with PCOD,Stomach Cramps,",0,0,YES,"I first consulted Dr. Kalyani for assisting me in conceiving. The very first consultation with the doctor convinced me to get my delivery done by Dr. Kalyani.  The doctor was very friendly, kind, positive, listened patiently to all the queries and explained the treatment. With her advice I was able to conceive within 2 months.
The regular follow-ups during the pregnancy duration were very pleasant and the doctor always motivated me to go for normal delivery. She advised to maintain proper weight, and during the third trimester asked me to do squats , yoga, walking and household works, as being active helps in normal delivery.
During my third trimester scan, it was found that the chord was around baby's neck.  The doctor asked us not to worry and said she would try to do a normal delivery.
During my last checkup, Dr. Ravi who is Dr. Kalyani's husband and anaesthetist recommended epidural which reduces labour pain significantly and aids in fast dilation. During our visits to Dr. Kalyani, we developed a great confidence on the doctor. So we readily agreed for it. 
On the start of 40th week, I got labour pains. It was a Sunday and I got admitted at 8pm.  Doctor checked me at 9pm and said that dilation was happening good and I might not even require epidural as there was possibility of baby to be born in 2 or 3 hours. At 11 pm again she checked and this time though there was some more dilation, it did not progress as fast as it was thought. By this time, I started getting intense pains and wanted epidural badly. But since chord was around baby's neck, the baby's heart rate at 2 contractions dipped to 90.  After that, heart rate again improved. Dr. Ravi suggested wait for some more time to make sure baby's heartbeat was steady above 120 before giving epidural. (He said if the heart rate dips alarmingly low, we have to do c section. Having both epidural and c section is not good).
Luckily the baby's heartbeat‚Äã became steady and after half an hour observation I was given epidural by Dr. Ravi. The pain reduced a lot and I even slept for 15 mins. It was past midnight by then. At around 1.50AM the dilation reached 10cm and I was all set to deliver.
Dr. Kalyani was monitoring the baby's heartbeat and motivating me to bear the final pain. Doctor, nurses and I were trying hard for 45 minutes. The baby almost came out but the chord was pulling him back a number of times.  At 2.45AM, the doctor suggested to use vacuum as a last try for normal delivery.  Finally with all strength I and nurses pushed and doctor used vacuum to pull the baby at the same time.  Baby's head had come out and chord was around the neck.  Doctor cut the chord and pulled the baby out. Finally at ,3AM my baby was born.
The doctor took calculated risk and it paid off well.  She is always available in case of emergency. I advise the patients to close their eyes and believe in Dr. Kalyani. She will take care of her patients with her experience and sincerity.
Anjani women's hospital is well maintained and clean. It has in-house scan, blood test facility and pharmacy. Support staffs are very helpful.

None,"Labor and Delivery,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I delivered a baby girl on 29th of August and I am really thankful to Dr Kalyani C Reddy for the way she managed my pregnancy days with utmost care. When we came to know about pregnancy being first time mother I was worried about which Doctor to consult but one of my colleague who is local to Bangalore referred Dr Kalyani *** **** *** ** *** ** *** **** ************ *** *** *** ** **********

The first time we met her we were very much satisfied with the consultation. The best thing about her is she is very calm, poised, vibrant, and vivacious with her unique personality of caring, supportive nature.The moment you start interacting with her, you will feel the positivity around you.

It was not an easy pregnancy for me as I was having severe gastritis from childhood and on the 2nd month I developed gestational diabetes. I could not able to take regular medication of Iron or calcium. She used to keep on changing doses and medicines to suite my health and each time¬† I visit her she used to do extensive counselling as I was not able to cope up with all the changes happening around me because of Pregnancy.

The real shocker came when I was in my 7th month and the baby was already in head down position. She insisted there might be possibility of early delivery and gave steroid and advised bed rest as precaution. At this point of time I was very apprehensive about my delivery but she gave me confidence that not to worry and there are still high chances of normal delivery if the sugar levels are under control.

On 34 week itself she found cervix is dilated to 3 cm but she insisted me that as long as I can keep the baby inside I should keep it and should come to hospital once I get labor pain on regular interval. As first time mother I was anxious and used to call her each time I get even little bit of pain and even went once to her clinic asking her to admit me as I was not sure how is the pain but she was very clear that even if the baby can stay in womb for 1 extra day we should keep it.

Finally on date of delivery when I got admitted to hospital my pulse rate was very high as I could not able to sleep last night because of high tension. She came to me and asked to calm down and explained that there is every possibility of Normal delivery but just because of anxiety I should not get into C-section. After talking to her the pulse rate came down  üòÑ and ask my husband to present in labor room to make me feel comfortable. She also clarified that looking at the family history the labor will be very short and said no need of epidural. After 2 hours of labor I delivered a baby girl.

Anyone who listens that it was normal delivery they are not able to believe looking at my health condition and the general concept that in Bangalore normal delivery is a distant dream. But I can proudly say to them that ""YES!!! I delivered normally‚Äù

Thank you soooo much Ma'm for whatever you have done... it's a unique and memorable experience for both of us.

I would highly recommend Dr Kalyani to all the expecting mothers especially to go and experience her care and realize it by themselves.

None,"Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I am Bhargavi, Gave birth to beautiful boy with weight 3.72 kg through normal delivery on 14th October 2016. 
I want to summarize my awesome experience with Dr Kalyani madam and Dr Ravi Sir.
I started visiting Anjani women's day clinic from the first month of my pregnancy. Dr kalyani madam was so patient to listen all of our queries and she was taking at least 20 mins to explain us each time we visit. She never got irritated even once during our 9 months journey. 
She could have had so many sleepless nights in the hospital with labour patients but she never showed her tiredness or laziness when we went for consultation. 
She will be calm, open minded, gentle and smiley always. 
She will create a kind of bond in patients so that you will never think of other doctor in your entire pregnancy even though if you would have visited other doctors before coming to her. Best example is one of my colleague who changed her doctor in the 5th month and she suppose to go to her native in the 7th month but she cancelled that because she want to be with Dr Kalyani till she get delivered. Even I had a lot of pressure from my parents in the 7th month but I too cancelled going native. 
*** ** **** **** *********** *** ******** *** *** ******* **** ************ ******** She will put 100% commitment in her work and expects 100% results.
As per my personal experience she hold a medical rank of 80.This is a major achievement and shows us her talent and commitment towards work.

Finally I want to share my delivery experience.

I admitted hospital on 13 the October 6 pm since my due date was 14th october. Doctor came at 8 pm and induced the pains to me because I had not developed natural pains. Doctor finished her consultations and came back at 11pm. Full night doctor was in hospital watching my progress of delivery. Around 3 am i developed mild pains and by 5am I got full pains and I couldn't bare my pains after 5.30 am. I started forcing the doctor to go for section. She convinced a lot to bare pains but I forced her to go for section. Finally by 6 am doctor arranged for section by seeing my condition. There comes one more experience doctor Dr Ravi sir, experienced anastasian and who is also Kalyani madam's husband, both convinced me to bare pains for 30 mins more to develop strong contractions. They told me that I am in a favourable condition for normal delivery where many other patients will not have and they also said that its not their profession to push normal delivery patient for section. They could have done the section and its 15 mins job for them but their commitment to the work is entirely different when compare to other doctors. Wellbeing of the patient is very important to the both the doctors. 
At 7 am Dr Ravi sir induced some painless  called epidural which reduced my pains by 60-70%. This will be given only when you have strong contractions. Those who are planing for normal delivery, please don't think about pains.Doctors will control your pains if your baby condition is good for a normal delivery.

 Again 2-3 times I pushed the doctors for section but they convinced me very well to bare pains. Finally by 11 am they stopped giving painless and I couldn't control my pains. Everyone must have to bare this pain for 1-2 hours if you want normal delivery. By 12 pm I was in a better condition for normal delivery. Dr Ravi sir, Kalyani madam and sister's provided lot of support to push my baby. By 12.35 pm I gave a birth to baby boy whose weight was 3.72 kg.
Both the doctors cancelled their consultations and they were with me till I get delivered. I don't have words to describe the doctors and I can only suggest that believe in Dr Kalyani madam and Dr Ravi sir and stick to their decision's. If your baby is in a good condition for normal delivery then doctors will put their 100% effort for normal delivery.
I am a soft female and my height is 5.3 and many of my relatives told that you will never get a normal delivery and now they still can't believe that I have delivered normally with a baby weight of 3.72 kg. Even I couldn't believe this ",2016-10-17 14:10:15,False,True,srinivas,,,

I cannot express gratitude in words though i would like to encourage every other pregnant girl to heed to what your Doctor has to say! Dr. Kalyani helped me overcome my fears when i was in my lowest . I had a missed abortion in late 2021 and after that i met Dr Kalyani in March 2022 just for a regular checkup , to know when can i plan for pregnancy further etc! I was so much in self doubt but i think with her counselling it was pretty easy to believe in myself and we naturally conceived in June 2022! My pregnancy journey has also been very smooth with all the medicines provided by Doc, i even had hypertension which i think never posed a problem for development of my baby throughout. In my last month after growth scans , we found out our baby‚Äôs weight was increasing, doc suggested if i want a normal delivery i have to make few changes to my diet and stick to exercise/walking without any fail! I stopped eating rice and wheat completely and switched to Ragi/Jowar/Millets! I used to do 5k-7k steps daily as suggested by Doc! I think this all honest guidance helped me deliver a healthy baby weighing 3.1kgs normally. Also i would like to mention that the delivery process was also so encouraging and seamless! Doc and sisters waited for everything to happen naturally! No pain induction or any such thing was even mentioned or done with me! I was admitted at 1 pm afternoon where all i was asked to do was being active and do exercises and I delivered at night 1:30 am. So i think the greatest attribute of Dr Kalyani is being patient with her every patient and being honest in everything she does! Kudos to everyone at Anjani Hospital!

Apologies for the delay in the late post

I had lot of complications in pregnancy and visited her for the first time in  my 7th month of pregnancy. due to the cervical stich which got opened  i  had to go for a premature delivery. The moment we  met 

and the way she spoke is extra ordinary .  I delivered  cute twins which was a baby girl and baby boy  Dr.Kalyani  garu is a lady with a magical hands and magical words,  After the deliver also i had infection 

which got cured beacuse of  her and her moral support.  First of all i would like to say a big thankyou  to Dr. Kalyani garu for saving 3 lives . Big thakyou is not enough. I would want to bow my head to Dr 

Kalyani garu  and Dr Ravi garu for the support  that we got from them  is extremely awesome. Dr. Ravi garu is a gem of person  who comforts you with his talks  and the support. My  wholelife is not 

enough to talk about her kindness, patience towards  me and the moral support which we got was extremely tremondous when  we had no hope on the survival of kids .  she followed up with all the 

pediatricians about the status of the kids everyday.  I will have to find more beautiful words from the dictionary to describe her patience, humanity she had towards me  and my kids. I bet I havent seen  such 

an excellent doctor throughout my 28 years of life.  She is never tired of answering your questions. you will always see a smile on her face for which half of your problem will be gone  The staff in ANJANI

I always wanted to go with normal delivery which I conveyed same to the Dr and she has suggested all the necessary exercises, diet etc which will help to go through normal delivery and I followed the same. As I'm a foodie i had no control on my food and at 38th week my baby weight was above 3kgs which is very hard to go through normal delivery if baby weight increases as I had nearly 3more weeks left for my due date also my glucose level was 138 which is more and at that time mam has suggested few things on diet also suggested few exercises which helped me in getting my baby get into position also got natural pains before my baby got to overweight. Coming to my labour experience, my labour pains started early morning 2am and I called mam around 4am and she immediately responded to my call and asked to come immediately and by the time I admitted I was diluted by 3-4cms where my baby heartbeat was fluctuating btw 100-120. In this case actually doctors suggest for immediate c section, but Kalyani mam has patiently waited and suggested to take deep breaths which helped me to get my baby heartbeat to the required count and I had very intensive pains where at one point I had no control and asked for c section and at that point I was suggested if I can take Epidural(Pain less anesthesia) and with my acceptance I was given Epidural with which I got relief with my pains. With the help of mam and her staff in labour room I had given birth to a baby boy that too normal delivery. I had to mention the patience level of mam throughout my labour which is hard to see in almost all the hospitals these days and with my experience I can say that she almost tries and give time to her patients try for normal delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I am sharing my experience a bit late but it's better late than never. I started consulting Kalyani Mam from 2nd Trimester onwards. We were aspiring for Normal delivery and searching for a doctor who gives priority to Normal delivery. we found her review really good and started consulting her. I was very happy and satisfied from the very first consultation. She is very patient and calm in her approach which will help anyone to deal with any kind of health issues. And most importantly, she never suggests unnecessary tests or check ups, rather advise and encourage to go for home remedies. Like that my 9 months got over and we are blessed with a super cute, and healthy baby boy weigh 3.2kg on 29th April 2019 in Ovum Hospital through normal delivery. One suggestion I would like to give to all the mom-to-be who can go for Normal delivery, please take Epidural during labour pain. Inform Kalyani maam beforehand. Even though I took epidural after 6cm dialation, but it helped me to take rest for sometime, so that I had enough energy to push and baby came out easily. Dr Ravi (her husband) is the ansthesist and did an excellent job when I needed him the most.And special shoutout to Dr Raja, the Radiologist. He is an awesome and very friendly doctor. So my overall experience with Anjani clinic is very good. Clinic Staff is also very good. Even though I have complained so many times about their appointment system, but later I realised there is no way one can manage better than what they are doing now. I would definitely suggest Anjani clinic for a complete maternity service. For delivery, either you can choose Ovum or Motherhood where Dr Kalyani practices.

She was diligent, throughout and extremely knowledgeable through out our visits. Guided us with practical steps throughout the journey. 

Re the admissions / billing, I'm so glad they are not like the corporate institutions. We came out paying 78K which was exactly what we had prepared for a c-sec and were told that it was not going to exceed that amount. On the day of the delivery, the doc was on time and her husband is another very gentle human being who kept us assured and informed throughout the process. The rooms was just what we needed. Though we didn't have some facilities but who cared? We went for a delivery and came out with out little super start. The nursing staff is super friendly and very helpful. They came every time we needed them and were helpful is assisting with the motor nursing and baby care. The paediatrician Dr. Narendra was also very through with the new born handling procedure guided us through just what was needed and nothing more. Guys, you really define the whole mother and baby care procedures in the day and age of corporates.

Just a small area of opportunity: If there's anyway you can make the radiologist's room a little more soundproof, I think the Dr there would not have problems with the children outside running around. It is a birthing hospital after all.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my experiences with you all. 
As soon as I got to know I am pregnant the very first question is which Doctor and Hospital to visit. 

I got to know about Doctor Kalyani and Anjani Hospital via 
BWP Bangalore Women Power Facebook group 
As I hunted the group to know the best doctor in Hennur though I was living in BTM 2nd stage as in near future I had to shift to Hennur area and I didn‚Äôt want to shift the file here n der so for the first 3 months of my pregnancy I travelled all the way from BTM 2nd stage to HBR layout

On BWP group many had recommended Dr. Kalyani from Anjani hospital so I Googled to see the hospital image to understand how the atmosphere will be there as I saw the image my heart was like this place is right and I will definitely will be comfortable here. 
Bcz I was very clear in my mind I don‚Äôt wanna go to any fancy brands of hospitals and was very particular what I was looking for. 

So Finally I visited Doctor Kalyani omg I must say she is such a beauty at heart  n her every smiling face makes you feel fresh. 
So well she guided during the whole pregnancy. 
Even Scan Doctor Raja he explains so well n tells all things in details. Doctor Ravi also guided and explained so well about the anaesthesia as mine was C session he gave confidence.
Doctor Narendra  the Paediatrician also guided so well for the babies do n don‚Äôt 

Even the  Nursing staff, Senior sister Sheena , Chaithra, , Supriya  & all other nurses for extending their support and they are always available for any help
And guide you so well in each and everything needed even for feeding the baby to burping the baby to diaper change n all. 
Even the house keeping staffs are very nice n friendly Nirmala n Bharati 

I can say hospital is very nice and very reasonable in terms of pricing and they have a dedicated person also to help you on insurance so that you don‚Äôt have to run here n there. 

Each room is spacious n well ventilated and is provided with oven, refrigerator, an attached bathroom with water heater.
Located in good area too.  

Over all it was great experience and happy delivery time. 
I keep referring n recommending ppl here so that they don‚Äôt miss the best place for the best experience of life.  

Keep the Good work Team.

Eight months had passed and the ninth month had begun.

Doctor checked and said that the heartbeat was not feeling And then an ultrasound showed that the baby had died inside
As soon as it was known, the doctor admit my wife in his hospital
After that my wife started treatment.
Then I asked the doctor why they don't operate when it has happened.
We told the doctor why don't you do the operation when this has happened. The doctor told us that it is not appropriate for the baby to die in the womb, because of which the infection can spread in the body and the mother may have a problem.
So we should try to make the delivery normal
In the evening the doctor said that the delivery should be done by five o'clock in the morning and we will try.
When we were in the hospital, my wife was in a very bad condition and was crying a lot
The style of Dr. Kalyani Reddy and his staff is very good. They supported us a lot.
And because of their excellent treatment and encouragement, the delivery will be at 11:30 pm.

The good reviews on Practo also helped us in deciding the same. Since the first visit from Jan 2021, the doctor was friendly, communicable, explained all things candidly. We immediately felt at ease and felt confident in receiving expert medical care. The radiologist, nursing staff, and other hospital staff were also helpful and supportive throughout my pregnancy. Doctor asked for our preference for delivery and we wanted it to be a normal delivery. From our first visit itself, the doctor monitored every aspect of my pregnancy. Based on the same doctor judged my and baby's health for normal delivery throughout gestation and carried out safe and normal delivery in spite of delayed dilation. She advised me to have regular walks, squats, Kegels, and using the Indian toilet for aid in normal delivery. The doctor took utmost care of me and my baby at the time of delivery and was available all the time whenever required. She was constantly monitoring me and my baby's vitals throughout the gestation. She also advised us to go for Stem cell banking, the hospital took expert care in collecting and preserving the same during the delivery.

Actually I started consulting Dr. Kalyani from my 5th month of 2nd pregnancy. I could find her through practo. Thanks to practo for that. The reviews about Anjani hospital and Kalyani maam and her team what we see here are absolutely right. Dr.Kalyani is the passionate doctor I have ever seen in my life. In this covid situation, she gave me full confidence and care like one of my family members.My baby came to head down position from 4 weeks before when it is supposed to happen. Kalyani ma'am immediately noticed it and suggested the precautions to be followed to avoid premature delivery. With her guidance and God's grace, I could deliver my little angel at 38 weeks which is considered to be perfectly full term. The day when I delivered my baby was one of the days where covid cases were at its peak in Bangalore. The entire hospital team put special efforts and care to maintain all hygiene and precautions against covid situation and I got the best care one can expect.

I shouldn't have called this as hospital because it is just like my second home. Kalyani madam is gifted with amazing patience and knowledge. It seems when it comes to pregnancy it is just a piece of cake for her.She always prefers normal delivery. My journey started with Kalyani madam from 3rd month of my pregnancy and it lasted till my baby's first vaccination üòÄ And trust me, every time when I visited her my confidence was increasing and I always felt like I was in most safe hands üòÄ. I would keep praising her for hours so let me take a break. And thanks for everything Kalyani madam. *** *** *** ***** I should also really grateful to Dr Ravi sir. I knew him as an anesthetic specialist, but he can turn to any good thing when situation demands. I was having tough time with labor, I was with labor for more than 12 hours, and when it was the time to pop out my son I was fainted. But Ravi Sir who stood beside me just like my father and gave me the confidence so that I could push my little one to this beautiful world. hats off to you sir. You are really an amazing and kind person. And there is another amazing person Dr Raja Sir. He is fully packed with his technical knowledge and most generous attitude. He scans every patient to his own satisfaction, which is amazing to see in city like Bangalore. Thanks for all your time and help Sir. Every staff and admin department was on there toes to help. It was just wonderful experience. I would like to conclude saying that Anjani hospital is NOT there to make profit! It is there to give a top quality service. It empowers the true meaning of hospitality.  ",2020-01-11 07:57:24,False,True,Suma Hegde,Thaks alot for the great feedback ,2020-01-31T03:56:03+0000,Dr. Kalyani C Reddy
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"We are very thankful to Dr. Kalyani C Reddy for providing us an excellent experience through out the pregnancy journey. Dr. listens to all the problems calmly and provides the best advise. She answered our midnight calls and guided us appropriately. This was my second pregnancy after 9 years. I was hoping to have normal delivery this time as my earlier one was a C-section. Dr. encouraged us to go for a normal delivery.  During the initial checkup, she explained us about the possible complications for the normal delivery after a C-section. She advised me with diet and exercises for a normal delivery. During the growth scan at the end of third trimester it was found that the earlier scar was thin than expected to support for a normal delivery. Hence, Dr. advised us to go for a C-section.  We are really happy with the way she explained about each and every thing.
On 6th Feb 2019, I had my regular checkup done with the Dr. Soon after I stepped out of the clinic, my water broke. It became an emergency situation. Dr. immediately guided us to the hospital with instructions. Within next 2 hours, we were blessed with a cute little baby Boy :). We really appreciate her commitment towards her patient and she provides the best care and support always. We heart-fully thank Dr. Kalyani C Reddy, Dr. Ravi Kumar, Dr. Raja and all the nurses at the clinic.  We would not be able to forget the experience we had at Anjani Clinic.  We strongly recommend Dr. Kalyani C Reddy for all pregnancy related counseling and treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy care and management,Tubal Ligation,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy experience with the Dr. Kalyani C Reddy for my wife was Amazing, few things we would like to mention here:
We are returned from UK, after long gap (first baby is 8-year-old) From the time my wife got conceived till date (7days post-delivery all formalities are completed in awesome fashion) my wife was under Dr. Kalyani hood for her 2nd Pregnancy. 
She always smiles talks very nicely and listens to my wife issues/concerns which are common during pregnancy suggests very easy remedies for respective problem. It was sweet journey for us and my wife enjoyed every moment of it. She shared her mobile number during early days pregnancy visit itself and strictly mentioned to us for emergency calls only otherwise for any queries text messages.
In the entire 39 weeks of pregnancy she was on liberal/normal diet(Non-veg). First she tried for Normal delivery though first one was C-section due to various reasons (Scar thickness, pain at scar, baby weight etc. the risks are explained to us clearly) we opted for C-section (2nd time as well). 
She never prescribed any unnecessary tests, scans or medicines, she also helped in choosing best hospital for delivery without interfering in my final decision. 
After final scan @35 weeks my baby weight was approx. 2.990kg, she suggested 38 weeks +5 days grace period for D-Day. She had given freedom to choose flexible date and time for D-day. 
The D-Day was on November 14th and we are blessed with healthy baby boy(3.64KG). It was Wednesday evening we were admitted few hours before C-section doctor arrived on time and within 20 minutes I saw my dream baby and provided my consent in few seconds for family planning as well (This was well planned but requested Dr. Kalyani to have a word with me post-cesarean). The hospital experience was awesome and postnatal service by Kalyani was great. The Mother and Baby are doing GREAT at the time of review. 

If you have to choose gynecologist in North Bangalore, please go and choose Dr. Kalyani. The rest will be taken care by her.

Thank you Dr. Kalyani!!! we will remember you forever at least once in a day irrespective of country we are staying.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Labor and Delivery,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I am extremely thankful to Dr.Kalyani for everything she has done for me and my child's well being throughout my pregnancy. I have been consulting her since the time we made plans to conceive. From the first time I was very comfortable with her as she always insisted on going the natural ways like weight loss and exercises to be able to conceive spontaneously. And I conceived with just a few lifestyle changes like 40 mins walk a day. 

Despite her busy schedule, she manages to keep us informed and makes us feel reassured that we are taken care of. I am a very restless person by nature, and nobody but Dr. Kalyani could have helped me through my pregnancy with such peace of mind. Though I had low fluid levels and a few other observations in my scans, I don't remember one time when I walked out with a tensed mind after a consultation with her. 

During delivery too, she was very calm which was of immense support for me and my family.  When the labour pain became very intense, I cried for help. Herself and Dr. Ravi tried to calm me down, but I was blinded by the pain and hardly listened to them. As the baby passed motion in the womb subsequently, I had to go for a c section. 
As much as Dr. Kalyani helped me through my pregnancy, Dr. Ravi helped me through the final stage of my delivery. If not him, I would not held to my nerves. I am very much indebted to the both of them! 

The only concern I have is with Ovum hospitals. Facilities are average, I felt very uncomfortable with a few nurses (of course, night duty nurses are angels! they are extremely helpful)  and the labour room environment itself gave me a disturbed mind.  Because it is very close to Dr. Kalyani's clinic we had opted for it. As she was around, I was okay with the hospital, but would have  preferred some other if I had the choice. 

The staff at Anjani clinic are also very friendly, helpful and attentive. 

Overall, I would strongly suggest Dr. Kalyani and Anjani clinic to anybody who wants help with pregnancy. ",2017-12-06 06:57:57,False,True,Ajitha Valli C,,,

We consulted her for the full term of pregnancy culminating with a normal delivery. We now continue to consult with her for post-delivery.

She has immense patience during every visit.  She listens carefully, consults on any issues urgently, educates on best practices and always motivates for a normal delivery.  She consistently targets normal delivery with regular reminders (during consultation) of how to prepare for it. 

I should make mention here of Dr‚Äôs husband, Dr Ravi, who arrived urgently in the morning to give me the epidural after I was no longer able to bear the pain and was dilated to almost 5 cms. An epidural, when done by an experienced and intuitive doctor like him, is a safe procedure and way better than getting a C-section.  He is also quite patient and together they make a great team. In the OT, he assisted me by pushing against my abdomen to guide the baby out.

We had a situation during normal delivery where the baby‚Äôs heart rate suddenly dropped to 60-70 and there was also a loop of cord around the baby. The doctor urgently arrived at the hospital early   morning, stirred up the hospital team and prepared for C-section (after she informed my husband of the situation, that she would continue to target normal delivery inside the Operation Theater and that C-section would be performed in emergency only). Along the way to the OT, my mother-in-law requested her again to try for normal delivery and even in that tense pressure situation, Dr Kalyani returned twice to reassure my mother-in-law that C-section would be done only in case normal was too risky.

In the OT, Dr Kalyani motivated me and though I was exhausted, I got the strength to do a normal delivery within just 20 min. My mom and mom-in-law, who were praying different religions outside, were overjoyed (not to mention my relieved husband).

One of the main reasons for delivery not happening easily is my wife did not follow proper physiotherapy session.

The importance of decision making was important during delivery by doctor there Dr Kalyani Madam played a vital role and she is excellent have high patience level.
Through out the delivery process doctor and nurses were so patience and supportive

Just follow whatever doctor say blindly including tips diets and everything. Which are really helpful for normal delivery like exercises, breathing exercises, etc.

Exercise plays a major role,especially in the 9th month of pregnancy if you want to have normal delivery. Exercising regularly will surely help to combat stress and pain of labour.

Right from beginning of pregnancy doctor took utmost care in all the possible minor to major details. She conveyed all the updates as much required to have a satisfying view on 
each phase. All the tests and scans were advised, just as much required to ensure pregnancy goes in right direction. Medicines to my knowledge were quite conservative only to 
the extent required. Doctor highly emphasized in terms of diet and physical activity to ensure it goes for a normal delivery. Delivery took place on 29th June and Doctor 
was always near to my wife right from the point labor pains started to having a beautiful baby. She tried to the maximum extent to perform a normal delivery, but due to last minute situation
 have to undergo a C-Section delivery. Even post surgery care and attention offered by doctor  to my wife and the baby was quite wonderful and am very happy to visit her for the entire process

First of all sorry for the delay in dropping the note bit delayed.

I delivered our sweet little angel on 23rd of sep and would like to thanks Dr.Kalyani for bringing our angel to this world !!

To add on before conceiving itself have fixed on my doctor i.e Dr.Kalyani as at some point of time due to some pregnancy issue faced by one of my friend we visited ovum and met Dr.Kalyani for a second opinion for my friend and the way she handled the case and answered the queries made me to decide and no lookback on other doctors.

Right from day 1 have visited the Dr and have always felt that the way she listens to us and handle our queries and also try to always recall our medical history and suggests medication based on that is really commendable.

Pregnancy was smooth and during my 35th week i had to travel to chennai and as per advice from doctor i was able to participate in my sister wedding without missing and thanks doc for keeping the confidence and encouraging me  with the required medication and advice.

Finally during my 38th week completion based on my health condition i was suggested to go for a c-section and i got bit confused on why not opt for VBAC and have really bothered the doctor in asking so many questions but then she explained me clearly the situation and also convinced and clarified all my doubts with utmost care and patience.

Also informed doctor about the spinal headache which i had during my last pregnancy and she said she will take care of that in this pregnancy and as said she took care of that by discussing about it with DR.Ravi.

Finally on my D-day i met Dr.Ravi he is such a nice person have met my husband outside the OT and have spoke with him and asked him not to worry on anything as he will take care and as said he was so kind and very humble person and handled the anesthesia procedure so well that i dint face the spinal headache .. Thanks a lot doc for keeping that in mind.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"When we went to this clinic, we were in a very helpless situation of trying to get conceived for the past 3 years.  Dr Kalyani inquired about the kind of treatment we undergone till that point and assured about our chances of having a baby.
She tried a few cycles with  medicines for ovulation, egg rupture etc. But we were not lucky. Then she recommended to undergo ""laparoscopic ovarian drilling"" We got this done in our hometown. After we returned to Bengaluru, Dr Kalyani inquired about about medication suggested by our Doctor back home. She was very down to earth. She accepted my hometown doctor's medication and continued treatment. Luckily I conceived in my 3rd cycle post laproscopy. It was all because of Dr Kalyani's patience and motivational support that help me

After conceiving, she took very special care about my case. She suggested few precautionary measures for saving pregnancy and bit of laboratory tests as well. Till the 3rd month, Doctor cautioned us to avoid risks. She even stopped asked not to travel to my brother-in-law's weddings
Such was her special attention to my case. In many situations, she treated me more like a family member than a patient

During 6-9 months phase, she was very proactive in monitoring harmones, sugar levels, fluids etc and provided us with good guidance towards a health baby development

At the beginning of the last trimester, we contemplated going to to our hometown for delivery since my parents were away from hometown at my sister's place. Dr Kalyani convinced us to get delivery in bengaluru as my hometown locality is notorious for performing c-section. She said that there is 70-80% chances of normal delivery for me and assured 100% effort from her side in any hospital of our choice.
We preferred kalyan nagar area which is close to our house. Ovum, Specialist and motherhood were the options. We narrowed down to Ovum hospital under a corporate package
Dr Kalyani patiently spent time in not losing a chance for normal delivery.
My husband was also present inside the labour room. I struggled in the labour room. I thought may be I should change to c-section or may be take epidural etc - many thoughts in that room. Dr Kalyani tried to use all options - vaccum, fluid to go through a normal delivery

Finally on 22-Sep-2017 at 11:00 AM, our dream baby girl was born

I would also like to thank Dr Ravi for his guidance
I would also thanks the sisters both at Anjani clinic and at Ovum for helping me

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"When I was tested positive for pregnancy, I started looking for a good doctor and I came across DR. Kalyani Reddy though google. We thought of giving it a try as the location was not very far. We waited for almost 1.5 hours, but the wait was worth it.  First meeting itself gave me a lot of confidence and guidance for my 9 months journey.  

I was very excited as it was my first pregnancy. But suddenly in my 6th week, I started bleeding and had to get admitted in a nearby hospital at 11 pm in the night. Luckily and I can't thank GOD enough for this, the baby was safe. The SAC was detached from the wall, due to jerk while travelling. I was advised to be on complete bed rest for 3 weeks, which helped sac to get attached to the wall again.

Another issue I faced at 7th months and I was diagnosed with pre-mature birth symptoms and was again advised by her to take bed rest for 2 weeks, though was allowed to do household chores this time. 

Her great observations and expertise helped to come over these 2 major roadblocks successfully.

Finally I was admitted on 25th November at 4am in OVUM and at 1:30pm water broke and severe labor pain started. It was so severe that I was asking the doctor to do C-section as I was unable to bear the pain, but she encouraged me to tolerate the pain and go for normal delivery. But with god's grace and everyone's blessing, I was able to deliver the baby just in next 30 minutes. Baby came out easily at 2 pm and today am a proud mother of a cute adorable baby girl.

I would recommend everyone who is looking for gynec advise to visit Dr. Reddy, she is a pro *** *** **** ********* ****** ** ********** She is very patience, calm and composed. The best thing is she tries for normal delivery till last moment, unlike other doctors who go for C-section to mint more money. 

The only cons I would say is the waiting time as on few occasions we had waited even for 3-4 hours to meet her. But we never felt annoyed as each meeting was worth all the wait.",2017-07-18 12:10:43,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I Am blessed with a baby Girl that i had a normal delivery and baby weight was 3.7 kg, thanks to Dr. Kalyani Reddy and her team. I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Kalyani Reddy
throughout my pregnancy till the time of delivery. 
one of my Friends (colleague) recommended us and suggested us to go to Dr. Kalyani Reddy in Anjani Women's Day Care Hospital at HRBR Layout, Bangalore.
i would like to thank her for her suggestion and She has explained each and everything in detail. She's an amazing doctor and clearly explains whichever is good for us.

Initially i din't even think of Normal Delivery and I had Thought to go Hometown in the 5th Month itself but after visiting her for few days, i decided not to go home and get delivered here itself.
Its her positivity as a doctor which influences us and makes things very easy for Normal Delivery.

She has treated me so well that when ever I went for my check ups I used to feel that I am going to meet my friend.
She is always ready to listen patiently and answers to our Questions with a smile on her face which brings confidence to us and moreover She ALMOST stresses on normal delivery.

She made every visit a pleasant experience by answering all our queries and explaining us what to expect in future. She made all efforts to attempt a normal delivery.

She has a sweet smile always on her face and she talks to the patients so nicely and she gave her personal contact number so that we can directly contact her in case of any emergencies.
On the day of delivery also she finished her consultations and came down to hospital at 11 PM and stayed till the time of delivery. 

I highly recommend Dr. Kalyani Reddy and I'm very happy that I have chosen an excellent Doctor to deliver my baby and if anyone is looking for a Gynecologist.

Hats off for her patience in making us to move forward with good vibes!

Kalyani madam always takes precautions for healthy baby & easy delivery. We can blindly follow her inputs for a better output, can say. 
Though I had PCOD problem, she never suggested any medicine when we met her for children. In fact, she just said, reduce weight & you will be on track with your goal. 

During Delivery :

Thanks a lot for the Nursing staff, Ms. Chaithra, Ms. Vasudha, Mrs. Sheena & all other nurses for extending their support all the time. 
Staff is always available for any help & they are very pro active. 
The way they maintained hygiene in cleaning up & dressing us should really be appreciated! 

After Delivery :

Infant baby bath & Warm water bath for mother are followed with proper protocol. 
Red light therapy is used to heal the stitches faster. This gave me lot of relief from pains. 

Baby Care :

Staff takes care of making us to feed the baby immediately after delivery. 
Dr. Narendra, Pediatrician also assisted us properly & alerted us regarding feeding the baby in proper time intervals. 

Regarding Anjani Hospital :

It's maintained in a super hygienic way! 
Can say to the level of a star hotel with pro active staff. 
Proper food is given to patients under doctor's guidance.

I was very happy with the way she heard me out (it was my first) hence had a lot of doubts.she patiently heard me out and explained everything. I was also very happy with the covid measures taken by the hospital.Doctor Raja takes a lot of time to check each patient which can be annoying because they give you a time slot and never complete as per the time. Scanning process is extremely painful as he presses your stomach with the machine and checks. he should be a little gentle. he is also a little intimidating as he keeps screaming at his juniors.also the night duty nurses are very rude..particularly some dame named Parvarthi..i was admitted in the night and she came barging in and did not explain what she would be doing. whenever I asked her she used to say i know what i am doing..Also after my surgery, I had a c sec she came into the room during night time and I guess she was in her sleep..started speaking to my baby who was not feeding well.. she said ""drink fast, even I have to sleep""really did not expect a Nurse to behave like this. I wish doctor Kalyani had better nurses. there were two nurses during night time both were very bad.Kalyani mam's husband comes during the end and is very supportive and friendly..but he needs to know and understand the patient , he tries to be over friendly when the patient is all tensed.There is sister Sheena who is exrremely helpful and understanding All in all if you have a problem yes Kalyani doc is the best but I am not happy with the staff.also please reduce the waiting time. its almost like you have to leave everything planned for the entire day to visit the doc.i have already recommended her to my friends, she is really very good",2021-06-08 14:45:00,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We consulted Dr.Kalyani Reddy when I got conceived naturally. I highly recommend this doctor, as she suggests tests and scans that are only required for that month of pregnancy. Doctor never suggest unnecessary medicines and blood tests. Compared to other hospitals, the rates are very reasonable for consultation, blood tests, scans. In my 3rd and 4th month of pregnancy I suffered with severe vomitings, doctor handled my situation so gentle and gave mental support and motivated me from not getting into unnecessary medications that effects fetal growth. Based on my mindset, in my every visit, doctor answered my questions and doubts so patiently. On my delivery day, my water broke at 3:30am and I called doctor directly. Even at that time, she responded my call and softly directed me with next steps. After 3cms dialation, I was asking for epidural, thinking the contractions might be painful going forward. But doctor prepared me at that time that 'you are having less pain even at 3cms, that means you can handle contractions till 8cms'. That gave me some confidence and I removed the thought from my mind, opting for epidural even after 5cms dialation. Last minute motivation and support always matters. I delivered a healthy baby girl with 2 loops of cord around her neck and who was in OP position too. I made it normal delivery with all the support and motivation given by doctor. Without her I wouldn't have made it. Thanks a lot Dr.Kalyani Reddy for all the support you gave us. I specially thank Dr. Raja, Who patiently explained the fetal movements and parts during the scans.

Initially we faced few hurdles , but she guided us well. Right advice given at the right moment, made us to be the parents of our little prince. She listens very patiently, clear all the doubts what we have, motivates well whenever she felt we are low. She prefers all her patients to go for normal delivery, if we ask for surgery by explaining pros & cons, she will motivate to go with normal one, if in case of any complication then only she will accept to go with surgery. Dr. Ravi met us on the day of the delivery and comforted us about the procedure.

Like most of the women i also wanted my delivery to be a normal, all natural one.  Every consultation with her increased my confidence on normal delivery, because she also tries utmost to deliver babies normally and tries to avoid c-section or epidural unless until it is very much required. 

I didnt get pain till due date, so she suggested me to get admitted and get pain induced. But we wanted to wait for another week till i get pain naturally. She agreed but said i need to be carefully monitored regularly. When we had a scan on 40 weeks 2 days, we got to know my fluid levels had dropped low for a normal delivery and she suggested immediate c section. But she didn't want to force me to c section unless i m convinced that it is necessary.  Next morning we had a follow up scan which re confirmed low fluid levels. Got admitted the same day and delivered baby. Reports were right, fluid levels were really low and baby had already passed motion(doctor had advised on this earlier). Fortunately no respiratory impact to the baby because of meconium.

First of all thanks for letting us know what you went through. However, this also gives us an opportunity to put our perspectives forth. A gynecologist by profession is someone who deals with unexpected emergencies on a daily basis. The timing of such cases is hardly under our control. There are scenarios where I had to be there to attend an emergency in five minutes. There are occasions where I have left my food or even important personal work midway to attend to such cases. That's the nature of my profession and I don't mind that one bit, in fact, I love it. 

I do however take a reservation to people completely misunderstanding our situation and venting their opinions without so much as a second thought. No doctor intentionally makes patients wait. Our profession is such that it doesn't follow clockwork. When there are emergencies, we have to drop everything and rush, even if there are patients waiting in OPD or otherwise. We definitely cannot predict one how before whats going to happen. 

Now take your scenario for example. You had come for a pregnancy check up. Eventually when you set in labor and god forbid an emergency situation arises wouldn't you want your gynecologist to rush to your emergency care? Or would you understand if we complete our other consultations and then attend you? The scenarios changes when you put yourself in other's shoes doesn't it?

Anyway, rest assured we don't take anyone or anything for granted as our profession has taught us enough to prioritize specific cases like emergencies and there is no way around it.

Hope you understand.",2019-04-01T07:56:08+0000,Dr. Kalyani C Reddy

"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr Kalyani Reddy provided all my antenatal maternity care and delivered our son at Ovum in Nov 2018. We are very happy with all the care she provided. 

It was my first pregnancy. I was supported in staying active with exercise (high intensity interval training and yoga) throughout the pregnancy as well as a lot or domestic and international travel for my employment. 

I made several unconventional requests for my delivery and Dr Reddy was able to accommodate them, which I greatly appreciate. I asked that I be allowed to choose a birthing position and that interventions be minimized. She allowed me to listen to my body and spend a large portion of the second stage of labour on my hands and knees. She also did not give me an episiotomy or epidural and I was able to deliver with very minimal intervention. 

I felt supported throughout, delivered a healthy baby, and recovered quickly. We are so thankful to Dr Reddy.",2019-01-10 11:39:15,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

First of all thanks for letting us know what you went through. However, this also gives us an opportunity to put our perspectives forth. A gynecologist by profession is someone who deals with unexpected emergencies on a daily basis. The timing of such cases is hardly under our control. There are scenarios where I had to be there to attend an emergency in five minutes. There are occasions where I have left my food or even important personal work midway to attend to such cases. That's the nature of my profession and I don't mind that one bit, in fact, I love it. 

I do however take a reservation to people completely misunderstanding our situation and venting their opinions without so much as a second thought. No doctor intentionally makes patients wait. Our profession is such that it doesn't follow clockwork. When there are emergencies, we have to drop everything and rush, even if there are patients waiting in OPD or otherwise. We definitely cannot predict one how before whats going to happen. 

Now take your scenario for example. You had come for a pregnancy check up. Eventually when you set in labor and god forbid an emergency situation arises wouldn't you want your gynecologist to rush to your emergency care? Or would you understand if we complete our other consultations and then attend you? The scenarios changes when you put yourself in other's shoes doesn't it?

Anyway, rest assured we don't take anyone or anything for granted as our profession has taught us enough to prioritize specific cases like emergencies and there is no way around it.

Hope you understand.",2019-04-01T07:56:15+0000,Dr. Kalyani C Reddy
