I got Dr.Jyotikala's reference from my apartment group, and decision to choose her was right. Her approach towards patients is extremely good. One can freely ask all the doubts to her,and most importanntly she will encourage us to ask and explains it to us patienly without any hurry.I was super happy during my first visit itself, and I couldn't ask for more.She is strict wherever needed and at the same time friendly as well. She is always approachable in whatsapp which was really helpful, so that we can check with her in case of any doubts rather than panicking and going to hospital now and then.My delivery was during the lockdown and I had to manage with my husband alone during my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery. She had supported me with all advices and care which helped me to overcome the situation without any elders support during the time. I am really thankful to her for supporting me whenever I was down , especially post delivery.I followed her instructions and it helped me to have a normal delivery - Like home cooked food, walking, simple exercises. Most importantly she prefers Normal delivery.Thank you doctor for all the support you gave me during my entire pregnancy and even after that.Highly recommend her if you are looking for a friendly and at the same time a professional doctor.Also, thanks to Columbia Asia nurses who were always approachable and took great care of me as well as my baby. Special mention of the canteen at the hospital. The food was really good \ud83d\udc4c. Haven't tasted such an yummy food at any hospital. Compared to other neighborhood hospitals , the main relief was parking. They have ample space for parking with valet option as well. Overall, all these scored high in choosing Columbia Asia hospital.",

                "review_text": "Penning down my review after 1 month of my delivery***** **** ** ******* * *** **** ****** * **** **** **** Initially I went to another doctor in another reputed hospital,however felt that doctor I consulted was making me panick and also hurry in explaining things. I got Dr.Jyotikala's reference from my apartment group, and decision to choose her was right. Her approach towards patients is extremely good. One can freely ask all the doubts to her,and most importanntly she will encourage us to ask and explains it to us patienly without any hurry.I was super happy during my first visit itself, and I couldn't ask for more.She is strict wherever needed and at the same time friendly as well. She is always approachable in whatsapp which was really helpful, so that we can check with her in case of any doubts rather than panicking and going to hospital now and then.My delivery was during the lockdown and I had to manage with my husband alone during my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery. She had supported me with all advices and care which helped me to overcome the situation without any elders support during the time. I am really thankful to her for supporting me whenever I was down , especially post delivery.I followed her instructions and it helped me to have a normal delivery - Like home cooked food, walking, simple exercises. Most importantly she prefers Normal delivery.Thank you doctor for all the support you gave me during my entire pregnancy and even after that.Highly recommend her if you are looking for a friendly and at the same time a professional doctor.Also, thanks to Columbia Asia nurses who were always approachable and took great care of me as well as my baby. Special mention of the canteen at the hospital. The food was really good \ud83d\udc4c. Haven't tasted such an yummy food at any hospital. Compared to other neighborhood hospitals , the main relief was parking. They have ample space for parking with valet option as well. Overall, all these scored high in choosing Columbia Asia hospital.",

She ensures to redirect you to appropriate consultants like the hematologist incase any issue needs special attention. During our first consultation itself we decided to go ahead with Dr. Jyoti Kala for the rest of our pregnancy. I would like to specifically mention about one thing that she is always available on whatsapp, her responses are always real time. She is extremely approachable and takes complete onus of her patients. She will make you comfortable and you feel positive whenever you talk to her. It is very rare to find such a doctor who is so professional and empathetic at the same time. Thanks a lot for all the support and help to make our pregnancy easier and successful. ",

Not only were we relieved after coming out of the doctor\u2019s chamber but after 2 days my wife already started feeling better. Thank you!",

Only if heart beat is documented in early pregnancy( until which pregnancy is NOT considered viable  ( I might consider giving pregnancy support hormone to support the pregnancy, till NT scan is done to rule out genetic issues. More than 80% of early pregnancy losses are those of non viable pregnancies which the body rejects on it's own, hence even if pregnancy support is given, it mostly lands up in missed abortion later ( no heart beat). Also please note that most doctors don't give their personal number or take calls on Sunday( which I did in your case ). In case of any problems, it is best to come to hospital emergency for check up as all diagnosis cannot and should be made on phone or WhatsApp.",
