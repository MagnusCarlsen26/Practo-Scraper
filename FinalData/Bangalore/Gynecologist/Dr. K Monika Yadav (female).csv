I met the first doctor who was available at Cloudnine OAR on that particular day, and got an appointment booked for Dr. Monika Yadav. I have heard of women investing time to research and find a good gynecologist who they can connect with. I consider myself very lucky to get a doctor like Dr. Monika. She's very friendly, easy to talk to, would explain in layman's term about anything and everything you want to know from your gynec. My water broke in 34th week and had to be rushed to the hospital late in the midnight. Doc was informed and she came and visited me early in the morning, I think around 5-6 am. I was in pain for close to 18 hours. I almost gave up and was ready to go for a C section for I couldn't bear the pain anymore. But Dr. Monika gave me hope and relief and explained how beautiful and empowering it would feel after a vaginal delivery. She gave me strength and the mental power to endure the pain. I remember I literally called her every hour for some kind of update as I was hanging in pain and she would console me to not give up. And just as she promised, a vaginal delivery indeed was as beautiful as miracle. It sure is painful, but ""beautiful"", how Dr Monika calls it. I believe it all depends on your doc, and your comfort level with them. I would any day give her 10 stars on a rating scale of 5. I'm that happy and satisfied with her.  Dr Monika took such good care of me throughout my 7-8 months of interaction, she felt like family to me.

Since day one she ensured that we receive all the information pertaining to the process and made extra effort to explain us things that we were not knowing. She became our friend, philosopher and guide during the entire process and thus developed an amazing bond of trust between us. She tries to put emphasis on the natural food habits and exercises to ensure that the baby grows as healthy as possible. Off course there were come complications for my wife but we were explained so well about each and every tests that we had to do or the changes in medication that we had to undergo. She was available over a call/ message always and went out of the way to ensure that we experience and enjoy the entire process together. She is kind, thoughtful and doesn't prescribe unnecessary medications nor does unnecessary scans. We were amazed to see her determination to push us for a Normal Delivery as she thought that was possible. All she asked us was for some time to ensure that my wife gets into labor as naturally as possible. We went through the labor pains, had some agitated moments as it was the first time we were experiencing something like that, but Dr. Monika was there for us always like a guiding force doing what was needed and was right for my wife at that time. 
We had a healthy baby boy through normal delivery on 14th of Feb 2021 and things went exactly how the doctor had planned for us. We continue to see her for some post natal check ups and will definitely refer her to all our known and unknown ones too. 
She is the best (Yes we did take second opinions initially just to be sure off and can say this comparing few other doctors) not only because of the profession that she is in but also for the person she is ....smiling, jovial and with loads of patience.

She has advised me to send me all sugar readings to her everyday. It helped me to keep on a check regarding my diet.
