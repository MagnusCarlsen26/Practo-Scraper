***** ** ** ********* ****** ** *** ***** * Not just that, her patience to listen to the problems and positivity she spreads is highly appreciated. These qualities are very essential for the type of patients who would reach out to her.
Pre-Pregnancy consultation. 
Shilpa ma'am has been a pillar like support for us in the time of distress. We approached her after a biochemical pregnancy loss and unable to conceive again. She explained us the importance of staying stress free during the pregnancy journey and suggested very few medicines. She explained the situation very well and suggested IUI. IUI was also performed by her. Within a month of consulting her, I was pregnant. 
Pregnancy consultation 
We continued to visit ma'am for pregnancy checkup. Ma'am used to call us only when needed and she used to give preference to pregnant patients. She never suggested unnecessary scans ans medicines. Most of the minor issues were resolved mostly on phone. 
During pregnancy I was tested COVID + and ma'am also suggested necessary medication over phone and assured us that the baby is safe. She didn't charge me anything for these. Also she monitored baby and my health throughout pregnancy. 
Delivery
Due to low amniotic fluid, I had to be rushed to emergency for c-section. Ma'am was there to ensure that baby and I were safe. She even ensured that breast milk is sufficient for the baby and latching position is apt. 

Shilpa ma'am is doctor for my mother in law as well. She operated my mil for uterus removal and health was completely monitored by her. 
I strongly recommend ma'am for her expertise and attitude with which she treats patients. Like we have general physician, women especially need gynecologist esp like shilpa ma'am",2022-10-31 15:25:35,False,True,ramya narayan,Thanku for ur kind words,2023-02-05T13:56:54+0000,Dr. Shilpa Ellur
