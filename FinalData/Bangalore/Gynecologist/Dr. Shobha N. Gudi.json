So I visited Dr.Shobha ma'am at St. Philomena's hospital. She found out the exact problem in the uterus by doing hysteroscopy. The cysts were removed and sent for biopsy testing and she found out that it was a benign stromal nodule which was the problem. So finally she performed hysterectomy on me and removed the uterus solving all my health problems. *** ** ** ****** *** ** ********* ****** *** *************. She took really good motherly care and motivated me warding off all my fear. She's a kind hearted and good human being. God bless her and her entire team of doctors, to continue this service for life and save many more people like me.\nThank you so much ma'am.",

The cysts were removed and sent for biopsy testing and she found out that it was a benign stromal nodule which was the problem. So finally she performed hysterectomy on me and removed the uterus solving all my health problems. *** ** ** ****** *** ** ********* ****** *** *************. She took really good motherly care and motivated me warding off all my fear. She's a kind hearted and good human being.
