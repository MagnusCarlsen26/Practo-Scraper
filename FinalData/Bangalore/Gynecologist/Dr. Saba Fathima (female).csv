"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Dr Saba was referreed to us by one of my friends. She mentioned that she had a very good experience wrt the way she managed the pregnancy time and the delivery. Hence I also decided to consult her. Right from the first consultation she put me at ease and gave me detailed explanation about the various phases of the pregnancy. I first consulted her when I was about 6 weeks. The scan at that time revealed two sacs and she said that it might be twins. The second sac did not have anything inside it. So she suspected it to be a case of vanishing twin. But still she asked us to wait for a few more weeks to confirm. She was very assuring that this condition will not have any harmful effects on the sac which was developing. Went for a scan again at 8 and 12 weeks and the other sac still did not have any development. So the diagnosis of the vanishing twin was confirmed. Post this, the various scans were done at the required intervals. During the Double Marker scan, there was a medium risk of down syndrome which was detected and I was afraid as to what would happen to the baby. Dr Saba was again very assuring and suggested us to go for an NIPT scan which came back as negative for down syndrome. The rest of the pregnancy was handled very well. She used to clear our doubts whenever we asked without using any medical jargon in a way that we could understand.Two days prior to the delivery date, I started getting pain and I immediately called the doctor. She asked me to rush to the hospital and she came within a few minutes after I reached. She was trying for normal delivery and admitted me to the labour ward. Waited for almost 8 hours and still there was no sign of the cervix dilation. Finally the water broke and the duty doctor saw that there was meconium and immediately called Dr Saba. We were given an option to wait for normal delivery but opted for C-Section since it might have been risky to wait for a normal delivery. Finally after the C-Section I came to know that the baby had about 3 loops of the umbilical cord around her neck and that is why I was not able to push it through. The 3 loops was a risky one apparently which was handled very smoothly by Dr Saba and her team. Post delivery she gave a lot of tips on how to manage feeding, excercises for me, my food options etc. Even during the lockdown she used to regularly give advice if asked on an instant messaging app.
All in all,we had a very good experience with respect to the delivery and would highly recommend Dr Saba.",2021-02-28 19:36:51,False,True,Vidya,,,
