"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"During my pregnancy, like every expectant parents, we wanted the best for our baby and us. Luckily we knew Dr. Meeta before my pregnancy. She has done my polyp surgery. After that surgery I was very convinced of continuing with her for my pregnancy journey, and I’m very glad that we did. She is one of the best doctor I have ever met.
Dr. Meeta is exceptional in patient care and what I liked the most about her is her positivity and ability to put her patients at ease. She listened to all our questions and spent time for answering those and addressing all our concerns very patiently. 
 
Through my course of interaction with Dr. Meeta, I also felt that she possesses a unique quality of understanding that each patient is different and that she understood exactly what we needed. I was 38 when I conceived. I had a lot of complications in my pregnancy including hypertension, high blood sugar, low placenta position, low baby weight. But Dr. Meeta always kept me motivated and ensured that I don’t worry about things when not needed. She told to concentrate on that part which we can control and not concentrate on those which we can’t control.  She advised to take the entire journey of pregnancy and childbirth step by step which made it less overwhelming. She helped me to manage all my issues mainly through diet and lifestyle changes. She mainly focused on protein intake to increase baby’s weight. I really liked that she would recommend and encourage to follow home remedies to rectify a problem rather than prescribing medications. She also suggested options such as meditation and reiki to keep my stress under check.
 
She has not only been supportive and motivating during the entire period but also extremely understanding of all the apprehensions and questions that I had and helping me through it. She instilled all the needed confidence in us and at every stage took the best care possible with timely medications, counselling and advise. Every time, I visited her, the warm welcome and the positivity I got from her was the most important thing I needed.
 
During second trimester of my pregnancy we understood that we won’t be able to complete 40 weeks of pregnancy due to mu complications. So she prepared me accordingly and from 26 weeks she gave medication to mature baby’s lungs. Finally in 33+ weeks I have delivered baby girl via C section. Since the baby was premature and having LBW, she did all the arrangements to admit baby in the NICU under the care of Dr Ankur Rajavanshi after the delivery.
 
It needs a kind heart and immense presence of mind to handle such challenges and my case was a clear indication of her dedication to her profession and her patients. Dr Meeta was a blessing for us. Thank you Dr. Meeta and Cloud nine Team for all your support and guidance and for making my Pregnancy and childbirth journey so memorable.

Quick check with family and friends resulted in a few renowned names and my husband and I visited all of them to find out who we are the most comfortable with. I was already past my first trimester when I first visited Dr. Meeta and after meeting her I was very convinced of continuing with her for my pregnancy journey, and I’m very glad that I did. 

Dr. Meeta is exceptional in patient care and what I liked the most about her is her positivity and ability to put her patients at ease. I think this is very crucial for first time moms like me who over-analyze and google every medical term. :) She listened to all my questions and spent proper time answering them and addressing all my concerns very patiently. After each visit I used to come back calm and relaxed.

Through my course of interaction with Dr. Meeta, I also felt that she possesses a unique quality of understanding that each patient is different and that she understood exactly what I needed. She listened to my expectations, kept me grounded, and explained what I can and cannot control. I had some issues during pregnancy - anemia, high BP, high weight gain, low placenta position, lower baby’s growth than expected in some scans, and sometimes the blood test reports were not normal. But Dr. Meeta always kept me motivated and ensured that I don’t worry about things when not needed. We took the entire journey of pregnancy and childbirth step by step which made it less overwhelming. She helped manage all my issues mainly through diet and lifestyle changes. I really liked that she would recommend and encourage to follow home remedies to rectify a problem rather than prescribing medications. She also suggested options such as meditation and reiki to keep my stress under check. 

Throughout my pregnancy Dr. Meeta was very supportive of my decision of trying for a normal delivery. I was admitted during my 39th week as my labour pains began and during the entire delivery process Dr. Meeta and her team kept me comfortable and encouraged me in every possible way for a normal delivery before I had to opt for an emergency C-section. Her team took exceptional care of me while I was recovering in the hospital. The initial few days may seem very daunting for a C-section mom, but Dr. Meeta personally kept a check on me, advised normal diet and reassured me that things are all good which helped me face my recovery with positivity. 

Dr. Meeta was everything I expected in my doctor. I’m glad I chose her to be my gynaecologist during my pregnancy. I’ve been consulting her even after my delivery, and can say with certainty that she’s not a doctor you would go to only during your pregnancy, but someone you would want to consult during motherhood as well. 

Thank you Dr. Meeta for all your support and guidance and for making my Pregnancy and childbirth journey so memorable. ",2021-05-23 13:01:14,False,True,Sneha K,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"We had decided to consult Dr.Meeta Chawan for my wife's pregnancy from 4th Month, trust me it was the best decision we made. Initially hospital allowed only mothers to meet the doctor due to COVID situation and I was worried, as either myself or any of our family members couldn't get a chance to directly speak to doctor. But when I got a chance to meet the doctor via video conference and 1st week of December 2020 , Dr Meeta cleared all our doubts patiently. 

My wife cervix dilated by 3 CM in the 36th week itself but she didn't get the labor pain and Dr. Meeta Chawan suggested to wait for few more days to get the labor pain naturally for normal delivery and doctor initially doesn't prefer to go for C-Section or for starting the medication to initiate the  labor pain.  Family and friends circle was putting lots of pressure on us to get admitted for delivery, so we have visited the hospital again in the midnight. 
Duty doctor in the CloudNine examined my wife condition and consulted with Dr. Meeta Chawan via phone, then they asked us to take decision whether to get admitted to start the medication for labor pain or wait for few more days.  We were not able to make the decision and was in dilemma. Duty doctor explained us the situation and cleared all our doubts. So we decided to go home. Next day visited Dr. Meeta chawan again in the morning for OT. 
Dr. Meeta gave lots of confidence on  why we can take risk by going home and wait for few more days for labor pain and she preferred to push for the deliver al-teast by  37th Week.  It was on 9th Dec and cervix dilated by 4 CM but still no labor pain and doctor suggested to get admitted by 12th Dec, even when my wife is not getting the labor pain.   

As doctor suggested we admitted my wife on 12th Dec morning and doctor started the medication to initiate the  labor pain. Finally it was normal delivery with assistance of vaccum extraction, as my wife was unable to push the baby and got exhausted in the final stage. Due to vaccum assisted birth, my child head had bulged a bit. Dr. Meeta and pediatrician, explained the condition and they gave confidence that it will go away and does not cause serious problems.   As they have mentioned, we see changes in baby head as the days goes on. 
 
Best part is Dr. Meeta Chawan and duty doctor allowed me to be in the labor ward at the time of delivery.  This is my life time experience  , because of this, I could realize the pain and value of mother. We are really feel so blessed with baby. So I would highly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawan.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"We actually started looking for a good gynaecologist near Whitefield when we decided to have our second baby a year back. We had three options to choose Cloudnine, Manipal and Columbia Asia. Based on our previous experience with Cloudnine we decided to go with the hospital but not sure which doctor to choose. I left the choice to my wife and she decided Dr. Meeta Chawhan. Right from our first visit after our decision to have baby till the last visit after post pregnancy she had complete trust on the doctor in whatsoever complication might arise during the scan or blood test. She overcame all the little complications just because of the trust she had. How did she build that trust? Is that important? Yes, we wouldn’t have had our baby if we didn’t trust her. As simple as that. How did that trust grow? 
Let me explain here, 
on our first visit she made us understand two things 1. Second pregnancy is not that easy as first because of the following reasons a) 5 years gap, b) extra weight gained than normal during those 5 year gap. She first made us to think, decide and act. We decided and went to her for the second visit after conception. She said the same thing and asked us to do few tests. Although, i’m not very impressed after the second visit but my wife was very strong that she wanted to continue with this doctor for only  one reason “she cares for me”. Her personal care towards the patients health during pregnancy and after the delivery is the at-most important. She made my wife feel confident and positive towards all the complications that arise during the pregnancy.  On the day of delivery we had lot more surprises than we expected, yes just minutes before taking her to LDR, the doctor noticed that the baby’s head wasn’t at the right position to come out.. Also, the baby couldn’t resist inside as it passed motion and started drinking water, That’s when we felt the real expertise and care to bring both the life’s alive and she decided everything in a fraction of minutes.  She immediately rushed her to OT and took the baby out after little struggle as the baby have moved sideways. The baby didn’t respond as soon it came out, the doctor took all our worries and made all the possibilities to make the baby cry and respond. It is just because of her care and expertise, I have my wife and daughter hail and healthy now. We are writing this review 5 months after delivery and 1.5 years after our first visit to strongly recommend the doctor as the situation we had to go through had been one in thousand cases or millions but it was a happy ending. 
To be frank my wife had less complaints post second delivery (c-sec) than the first one (normal). We just  got words to say “Thank You” to the doctor but pray a healthy and long life for her.

Her patience, expertise, and kindness made the whole experience a memorable and pleasant one.

The doctors approach to pregnancy and childbirth was refreshing and reassuring. I really appreciated the fact that she did not recommend any unnecessary medications, scans, or tests. She always prioritized my well-being and the well-being of my baby above anything else.

Her advice on maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine was invaluable. It helped me to stay healthy throughout my pregnancy and to recover quickly after childbirth. I cannot thank Dr. Meeta enough for the guidance and support provided during this time.

I would also like to thank Dr.Meeta for being so accommodating and understanding of my needs and preferences. She was always available to answer my questions and address my concerns. Her positive attitude and caring nature made me feel at ease and gave me the confidence to trust the doctor with the delivery of my child.

Once again, I am grateful for the exceptional care and expertise. Dr. Meeta had truly made a difference in my life and the life of my family. I will always remember her kindness, professionalism, and dedication to her patients.

I really admire her hardwork and I have seen her in hospital even on Sunday's for IP rounds.

We are extremely grateful to have met Dr. Meeta. We were extremely cautious about the whole pregnancy and childbirth experience. Dr. Meeta made us feel comfortable every step of the way and made the whole experience enjoyable.

We were tested positive for the virus during the 5th month of pregnancy, and were really concerned since we had lost a close family member to the illness just the year before. But Dr. Meeta helped us get through it smoothly and with as little medication as possible. 

Most of her treatment is natural. She suggests lot of natural remedies to most of the complaints. She only prescribes medicines when it is absolutely necessary.

She keeps us informed on what to expect at every stage of the pregnancy. This helps us to be mentally and physically prepared. 

We had opted for elective C section early on, but our case became an emergency unfortunately on the day of the surgery. The whole team at the ER at Cloudnine handled the situation professionally. There were a few other emergency cases that day and several planned C sections for that particular day. Dr. Meeta and her team kept visiting us in the IP room all this time, and kept advising us on the treatment options. 

Everything went smoothly and we are blessed with a baby girl.

We were overall more than satisfied with the experience at Cloudnine and with Dr. Meetha Chawhan. All her guidance and treatment made the whole experience very pleasant. We highly recommend Dr. Meeta for her experience and professionalism.",2023-01-21 11:21:27,False,True,Vandana N,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"We found Dr. Meeta's profile over internet when we were browsing through the gynaecologist list for our pregnancy. As per the review, we planned to visit her and post the visit we decided to continue with her.

She had a very positive aura around her which helped me throughout my pregnancy. She always made me very comfortable with her calmness and made sure all of my queries are answered with logical reasoning.

It was advised to me to have all types of food and keep no restriction on the same. Ofcourse, the food was supposed to be home cooked; mainly protein rich since it helps in the growth of baby weight.

I really liked how she has always been in favor of not taking unnecessary medicines and try to cure the issues by natural methods (i.e. home remedies).

Her whole staff members has been very supportive during my delivery. Each and every person made sure that I get the bestest care not only physically but mentally too.

In the LDR, the whole experience (had a vaginal/normal delivery) just felt like a magical one just because of her and her team! 

How can I ever forget those words right after my last push 'Congratulations, it's a girl!'.

It was a very emotional moment for my husband and me. She gave us a few minutes with the baby to relish that moment which I can never thank her enough for.

The best thing was having my husband by my side throughout the delivery which was again supported by her. Huge thanks to her for this.

Generally, there are many restrictions on consuming all types of food right after the delivery for 1.5 months irrespective of the type of delivery one has had (which I feel is a myth, now). But, she advised me to have anything and everything healthy. I was also asked to start with walking so that the healing process gets faster.

And, it really did help me!

I'm still in touch with her for my post-natal care.

If I had to do all over again; I would do just because of the confidence and trust I have on her.

We got to know about Dr Meeta Chawhan through online search and the experience has been very good since day One.
As this was my first pregnancy, I always had so many doubts and concerns and she used to answer all of them with proper reasoning. As soon as you enter her room in OPD, she greets you with so much warmth and makes sure that all your queries are answered properly. She is very positive and polite. Another best thing which I like about her is that she never advices to take unnecessary medicines and always focus on home remedies which are very easy to follow. 
She always made sure that my weight was under control and focused on diet and fitness. She suggest diet (Good protein intake) which makes sure that the baby’s growth is good.  
She always motivated me for normal delivery however, due to certain medical conditions we had to opt for a planned C section which also went very smoothly all because of her. Due to some personal reasons, we decided to go for the surgery during wee hours and she agreed at once. I would also like to appreciate all her OT staff(Assistant Surgeon, Anesthesiologist and all others) present during the surgery. They were all very cooperative and made sure that I was very comfortable during the delivery.
In case of any doubts, she responds on text as well without any delay. 
My pregnancy journey was a blessing all because of Dr. Meeta and we have been blessed with the best gift of our lives through her. Our baby boy is 5.5 months old now and her words during the delivery still echoes in my ears (“Aparna it’s a boy”).
I am still in touch with her for post pregnancy check ups and I am always excited to meet her because of her positive attitude (specially to listen to that first energetic line “Hi Aparna, what’s happening. Kya ho raha hai aaj.” 

It’s really hard to find Doctors like her these days. I would highly recommend her to all the couples who are looking for a good gynaec.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I would highly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawhan as she’s not just an extremely knowledgeable doctor who is good at what she does but also has the patience to listen to the patient, provide care that a patient needs, energy and enthu that lifts the patient’s morale and the friendliness that she brings into the conversation that takes out all fears and one can openly talk! 
She was recommended to me by one of my friends and I am glad to have her as my doctor when I became pregnant after a miscarriage. My prenatal test results (NIPT) showed some complications, we were extremely tensed and were not ready to hear the bad news / loose the baby. She patiently listened to our concerns and queries, removed all misconceptions, explained the positives and negatives of taking up further tests and also explained the complication in a very clear manner plus what NIPT screen test meant. It gave us confidence to take up amniocentesis to further get clarity if the issue is really there or not. Luckily amnio results all came negative and we now have a healthy girl baby. 

She encourages healthy eating and make up for the deficiency rather than prescribing a medicine. She monitors closely and then prescribes a medicine only if it’s absolutely necessary. She also recommends certain home remedies along with eating healthy and medicine supplements (if needed). She always says “Mother should have a balanced diet, with good amount of protein, fruits and vegetables and lesser carbs and stay healthy. The one gaining weight has to be the baby!” 

Thank you, Doc! It was your medical advice and guidance that helped us (including my dead husband here as he was anxious too after the NIPT, Amnio etc etc) sail through the 9 months and give birth to a beautiful baby girl + recover well from c-section. Thanks for making our journey easier and a memorable one.

We would unquestionably recommend Dr. Meeta to all expecting mothers and the ones who are thinking of starting their family! 😊

Very friendly doctor.
Would always listen to all my queries no matter how silly they were.
Since i had first delivery normal, she was always sure i would have normal delivery and push me to walk and stay active.
Even till last day, she was hoping for a normal delivery even with a macrosomic baby and ready to try but clearly stated the complications that could occur.
But since even the baby position wasn't favourable plus complications that could happen due to macrosomic baby, she had to go ahead with a c section.
And i am really thankful to her for her suggestion, as normal delivery would have caused more harm than good to me and my baby due to his birth weight.
I panicked during my c section and she took good care of me and informed my family outside about it and told them she has given me resting medication.

She would always reply to my whatsapp messages if anything urgent.
I had eclampsia post pregnancy, and she took great care of me.
She informed her staff and me on whatsapp on what to follow when i was on an emergency at night and followed up.

But with her advice on diet and exercise I reduced weight from 89 kgs to 67 kgs and the problem went away on its own. Doctor is very straight forward and practical, she will understand your situation well and suggest natural ways first rather than going for medicines or diagnostics. That really helps a lot in growing confidence in you and motivates you to work towards your problem yourself. Doctor also listens to your problem patiently and lets
you express well, she clarifies all your queries.
Second time I went to her for my pregnancy. Throughout this period I had some issues but she handled everything very nicely suggesting to drink lots of water, frequent food intake, exercises ,walking and working till the last day before delivery.

In the 9th month, our last visit to doctor, she told us to get admitted the next day and also told us that doctor can only assist but actual delivery mother has to do so be ready for long labour hours. If you can bare the pain we can deliver without C section. We attended lamaze session in 35th month. The physiotherapist, Dr Nitha, taught us different breathing techniques and different stages of labour and how to differentiate between false labour and actual labour pain. We admitted to the hospital by 10:30 pm in night and labour pain started by around 5 am in morning. Nurses were in constant touch with doctor, the whole night. By around 6am Dr Meeta visited us and by 6:45 we got our son delivered. It was a normal delivery. Me and my wife were literally on Cloud Nine. That day only we knew what is meant by Khushi ke Aashu. It was a feeling that no one explain in words.  One thing, I specifically want to mention is that the breathing exercises was really helpful. I accompany my wife in the labour room.

I also really appreciate the fact that I could have open communication with doctor on any matter and receive answers that helped manage my entire pregnancy. Also due to COVID situation, we could not travel to the hospital for all check ups and had to consult doctor via video call. I was initially worried how this would impact me but all my doubts were removed because even during video calls, Dr. Meeta enquired about my condition and provided solutions as needed. I felt there was no difference in the treatment provided on call compared to physical check up. 

She is also highly responsive and responsible to/for her patients and this is a great quality. I had to rush to the hospital as my water broke and she was available and responding to the on call doctor and nurses at the hospital and guiding and checking up on the situation regularly.

Hospital: Cloudnine Whitefield

My experience with Dr. Meeta Chawhan at Cloudnine was nothing short of phenomenal.

I had mainly 2 requests during my pregnancy:
1. To have a normal delivery, provided there's no serious health risk to me or my baby
2. To prevent the use of unnecessary medicines through out, and opt for their natural alternatives instead.

Luckily, Doctor Meeta's priorities as well aligned with mine - she did precisely this, and much more. She is honest, blunt as well as forthright, and emphasizes eating right, exercising and maintaining a healthy physique.

Dr. Meeta is extremely experienced in the field and knowledgeable, and inspires confidence. When she entered the room during my labour, her manner and actions assured me that someone super-qualified was in the driver's seat - and everything was going to be alright. Her able guidance allowed me to have just 3 hours of active labour, which culminated in the delivery of a healthy baby boy.

I remain forever grateful to Dr. Meeta for a cherished and memorable pregnancy, with absolutely no worries or concerns throughout. The duty doctors and staff of Cloudnine were immensely helpful and did a superb job as well during my admission.

You are ok with not getting answers to questions that aren't important at that point of time, like asking questions around natural delivery or c section in the first month.. Rest assured, she will answer all your questions at the right time. And it makes sense to do that as she doesn't want the mother to take unnecessary stress about things which are not even to be thought about at that point of time*Long review*We were new to Bangalore and didn't know any gynecologist.  We checked for doctors on practo and came across Dr. Meeta's profile. We saw very high number of positive reviews and most of them mentioned that she is more inclined towards natural delivery and remedies. Thats what made us choose herDr. Meeta is an excellent doctor. Through the entire 9 months, there wasn't even one instance when we thought of taking a second opinion about her advice.  This was inspite of me having a family full of doctors who are surgeons and specialists. We could have easily cross verified what she told us to do, through our contacts. But the way she explains the reason for all the things she tells you to do or for the medicines she gives is simply outstanding.Through out the 9 months she was patient enough to answer all our questions. But as I said before she won't really answer questions that are not relevant at that time. She'll tell you ""there's still a lot of time for that. Don't think about it right now. We'll look at that when the time comes"". Which is the right thing to do in my opinion. An expecting Mother shouldn't be thinking about unnecessary things and adding stress to her pregnancyEven during the time of delivery Dr. Meeta was extremely professional and had the right balance of motivating the mother and pushing her to push harder for the baby to come out. I would certainly recommend her to anyone we meet. It's a definite 10/10. You would be extremely lucky to get your baby delivered through her.",2021-01-11 07:02:13,False,True,Aniruddha Pawade,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Delivery,Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Meeta Chauwhan @ whitefield, Bangalore. Consultation started right from the first trimester. We were actually scared with the whole covid 19 pandemic and how things will turn out with delivery with all the covid 19 pandemic and associated risks.

Dr. Meeta has been very friendly through out the journey.  Aside the scans we seldomly visited the hospital for consultations. Most of the time the consultation was over the video/online unless physically check up was really needed. Dr. ensured that we are comfortable and explained everything in detail, answered all our queries. She helped us overcome the fear of delivering during covid. We never felt that consultation is being done over video. Consultation prescription and lab/scan reports were uploaded on the cloud nine mobile app.
Dr. Meeta advocated more on eating good than taking supplements or medicines. Our case was a little complicated with fibroid in uterus. We were nervous but she explained the complications, associated risks, possibilities and how to manage all this very nicely. With the dos / dons and diet suggested by Dr. we could control the fat and unnecessary body weight, pain due to fibroids and focused on babies health.
Considering the fibroid and twisted uterus, Dr. suggested to go for c section and managed the delivery smoothly. 
Post delivery we continue to consult and Dr is assisting with healing of uterus, recovery and fibroid treatment. 
It has been a great experience. We highly recommend Dr. Meeta.

Having been married for 9 long years somehow motherhood kept evading me and we reached a point when I had almost given up all hopes. Three times I conceived, but by 10th or 12th weeks I would miscarry. All doors and windows seemed shut. Finally we were referred to Dr Manju Nair at Cloud Nine Babs she ensured I succeeded getting pregnant with twins and referred us to Dr Meeta to take the pregnancy successfully forward. I still remember the first meeting with Dr Meeta. It was on 16 Mar 2020 with my first scan report. She literally surprised us with her overflowing energy and positivity. She instilled all the needed confidence in us and at every stage took the best care possible with her timely medications, counselling and advise. She was not just a doctor, but a great friend, philosopher and guide. My entire pregnancy was such a smooth journey under her care and practical approach to dealing with the entire 9 months. The last minute before delivery challenged our family like a demon in mask. As it was decided that we will need to go for C Section, everything was planned for 03 October 2020. As a protocol during this pandemic I had to get a covid test done and came the result as a boomerang. in spite of taking all precautions I tested positive and by 01st night my fluid levels went low and the babies had to be delivered on emergency. She took the best of all her efforts to ensure to get all arrangements done in cohesion with the hospital management and safely delivered my babies on 02nd October 2020 afternoon. She didn't stop with that but went and extra mile to get me moved to another hospital for covid management and entrusted my babies in the NICU under the care of Dr Ankur Rajavanshi as they were born late preterm at 36 weeks 5 days. It needs a kind heart and immense presence of mind to handle such challenges and my case is a clear indication of her dedication to her profession and her patients. I would strongly recommend Dr Meeta. She would reach me everyday to check on my health and also update me on how my babies were doingBeing under the care of Dr Meeta through your pregnancy means being safe. Thank you doctor...

And at the same time, she also assured me that in extreme case scenarios, even if I deliver baby Pre-Term, we will take of him/her. Finally I delivered a healthy baby boy in my 37th week. Everyone had told me that you were in bed rest for four months, and it would definitely be a C-Section but Dr. Meeta proved them wrong as I had Normal delivery.

During this whole 9 months of consulting her, she never advised to take supplements or unnecessary medicines rather she was pushing for home made remedies. She was very clear from day 1 that we should attempt for a normal delivery. She was very strict with the diet and made us understood the need to excerise and maintain a high protein diet. This eventually helped me not to gain extra weight. On Couple of occasions, I had to get admit due to severe nausea/vomiting(2nd month), Dr was available to guide us through calls even during the wee hours of the day. This was during Covid and with no family members able to come from home town, we were terrified how things will go during labour and after delivery. Few sessions with Dr meeta in week 37-38 helped us in regaining our confidence. During the labour, I was unable to bear the pain and almost screamed at the staff to take me to OT and do a C section. It was Dr meeta who hold me like a guardian angel and gave the strength to bear the pain and go for a normal vaginal delivery. The way she conducted the whole delivery process was so beautiful.

I had mishap during my first pregnancy. After meeting Dr Meeta the first thing she told me to forget the past and look forward being positive. During each visit she made me more positive and confident. Else I was overly terrified and scared each days during the 1st trimester. I started consulting her during the 2nd trimester of this phase. She made my journey so enjoyable. Apart from being a good Obstetrician she is one of the best human being who always bring positivity in her patients. During the journey the way she suggested about the diet , exercises and other things to follow I just listened to her blindly. And I found each day improvement in my mind and body. At the later stage I was seeing myself a complete different me. I started believing I will get back my rainbow baby in my hand whom I lost. During each visit she narrates what shall be the next plan what tests etc needed to be done. I just followed her. Since I was scared I discussed with her if planned C section can be done. From starting of checking up with her she always told me to do normal delivery due to its multiple advantages. However since I was scared I discussed with her about planned C section on my 37 the week. After checking all reports n baby’s growth she agreed on that. Now I am blessed with a baby girl. My baby is all fine and healthy and 17 days old. 
I consider her the Goddess of our life who has helped us to get a gift from the God up there and helped us to meet our rainbow baby angel. We shall be forever grateful on her.

I would recommend all to meet her if you really want your pregnancy journey to make the most memorable one. Another quite important part during the pandemic time when the lockdown was going on, she was available either through video consultation or physically (alternate days). Since our angel baby born during lock down phase we were scared how things will happen etc. Again she relaxed me and made me confident that no matter what Govt takes decision I will get to meet my baby for sure. Such a memorable experience I had with her during my pregnancy phase.

I thank her and the entire Cloudnine Whitefield staff (duty doctors, sisters, child soecialist doctors, administrative staff, securities, housekeeping staff) for taking care of me and my baby during the 3 days I stayed there post delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"When I got to know that I am pregnant , I started searching for a good doctor near my house and got to know about Dr. Meeta Chawhan. Started visiting her from day one and I still remember her first question - ""Pregnant ... What's your feeling ?? Happy or Sad ? ."" I said Sad, she asked why ??. I was like I am very scared by the delivery pain which we get during normal delivery (as my first one was normal delivery). 
She smiled and said don't worry, 99% this time also it will be a normal delivery. I said I don't want that pain again and then she convinced me by giving options available for normal delivery like painless etc.
I would say she is an amazing and talented doctor. From the starting she made sure I exercise or walk alot (since I was little overweight and this might increase the risk during pregnancy), eat healthy protein rich food, relax and most importantly enjoy the pregnancy.
I followed her instructions and was quite impressed by her detailed knowledge on all the conditions and issues. She is quite friendly, so you can discuss any problem related to your pregnancy.
I was waiting for the labour pain to kick in which didn't happen till my last week that is 40th week and I was quite tensed. Met her and spoke to her about it, she said don't worry. Our first motive should always be of ""a healthy baby"" and second for sure of normal delivery, but don't get tensed because of it. 
Finally, I got admitted and artificial labour was induced, post which also for a very long time the baby didn't come down (since the baby had the cord stuck around him). And the miracle happens, even after the situation, she waited for quite a long time and I delivered my baby via normal delivery.
I would give all the credit to her since I never expected that even after in such situation I will be able to deliver normal.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"My wife's last pregnancy was through and through a high risk one due to her age, hyper-tension and blood sugar. We were actually consulting another very experienced doctor in another hospital in Whitefield.

During the first trimester scan, it appeared that her cervix was small. As soon as the doctor looked at the report, she reacted sharply and asked my wife to undergo a binding procedure. We were psyched due to her reaction. However, we weren't convinced that she has to undergo a surgery so early in her pregnancy.

That's when we saw Dr. Meeta Chawhan through a friend's recommendation. In the first consultation itself she calmed us down - especially my wife. As soon as we stepped out of the consultation room, my wife told me that she got a very good vibe and would like to continue seeing Dr. Chawhan. We couldn't be happier that we did.

Throughout the pregnancy, Dr. Chawhan aptly demonstrated her expertise in handling such high risk patient, not just through diagnosis and treatment but also through her human touch. She knew exactly what our apprehensions were and how to alleviate them. She did so by slowly cutting down on the amount of medicine my wife was administered initially by the previous doctor. She also put only the much needed restriction on travel and food but eased that out too slowly. Also, through out the duration, we never had any feeling that she is recommending undue tests.

My wife's aunt is a very experienced (30+ Years) OB-Gyn practicing in Australia. She also kept vouching for Dr. Chawhan's treatment and case handling through my wife's pregnancy.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Meeta Chawhan has been with us throughout the pregnancy - from the day we dropped into her office to make sure test results were really true to the day she delivered our baby. With all the struggles I had gone through to have a child, I was extremely nervous about this pregnancy. My husband had actually done some random net search to find a doctor, as we had just returned from the US and didn’t know anyone in the city. In our mind, we were there just to confirm the pregnancy.  But after the first consultation, there were no second thoughts about changing to any other Gynaecologist.
Best thing about Dr. Chawhan is her reassuring demeanour. Time and effort she took to always cheer up my spirits made sure that those nine months remained as a wholesome treasure of a memory with me. She is atypical for an allopathic doctor - thoughtful before prescribing unnecessary medication. She brings human touch to her interactions beyond lab reports and CT scans. *** ** **** ************* *** accommodative of cultural nuances that influence many decisions that expectant parents make.

She has very positive attitude, keeps calm and has great patience to listen and clarify each and every possible doubt. She prefers simple yet effective home remedy solution for the treatment. She encourages healthy weight gain and exercise throughout the pregnancy.

There were some complications during first trimester. She provided great support to handle the situation and recover from it.

I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during second trimester. She advised not to take medicine rather control diet and monitor blood sugar level on regular basis. It worked out nicely.

I was really worried when diagnosed with ICP and low amniotic fluid reported in the IG scan. Physical consultation was not available that time due to surge in Covid cases. She made me feel relax during video consultation and looked confident with healthy delivery. It took all my fear away. We are blessed with a healthy baby girl!

The initial consultations with Dr. Meeta gave us sufficient confidence to move to Bengaluru and continue our journey with her at Cloudnine.
She stresses a lot on diet and exercise which I think are critical during pregnancy. She is very punctual and listens to you/your issues and has logical answers for all of them. And the moral support we received whenever we spoke with her just took away all our stress.
Finally, I could deliver a healthy baby boy through elective C-Section (personal choice as I am fearful of elaborate operational procedures) though Dr. Meeta was insisting on normal delivery as I was healthy and had all parameters in place.
Post my C-section, the diet that was followed for me as Dr. Meeta’s patient was vegetables/fruits based and we were totally impressed.

Exactly last year in 2019, Dr. Meeta madam had helped my elder sister to deliver a baby in Cloud9 Whitefield. I use to visit most of my sister's consultations with Dr. Meeta. After those visits and delivery, I loved the way she interacted with my sister. It may be the confidence that she gives to her patient, It may be the solution she gives for each problem which can occur. Or It may be the atmost care they take during the delivery time. 

Experiencing all this as a third person, It has become a very easy decision for me to opt for a consultation with Dr. Meeta for my baby delivery. 

1. The Confidence she gave me has helped me come out with all smiles after each consultation and in having a smooth delivery. 
2. She used to provide apt solution for each problem I had during the pregnancy time. 
3. The care they took for me during the delivery time is unforgettable.

I had consulted different Dr & City for my first pregnancy which was high risk pregnancy with high BP & 1.8kg IUGR baby. I was so worried about the second pregnancy in the beginning. But everything kind of changed positively after consulting Dr. Meeta. I delivered a healthy 3.1kg baby in 37th week via c-sec as per the plan. Due to low birth weight of 1st baby my health condition was monitored closely. First thing is she instantly makes you feel comfortable and feeds positive energy into you. I was so free to discuss even petty things that I was facing during the term and she patiently advises on how to handle them. *** ******* ********* *********** ********** ****** she gives lot of home remedies. I never had high BP during this term. Her food diet chart was the best with more protein in it. I followed it religiously that way I had put on only 10kgs and 3 days after delivery i had reduced by 8/9 kgs. Whole family is happy with her.

I have to say one more thing, when I was in the OT for my procedure, I was very scared and anxious (it's quite natural to feel so), but just a sight of Dr. Meeta in the OT got me my confidence back and soon after half n hour Dr. Meeta announced the arrival of my new born. During the recovery process as well, Dr Meeta personally monitors her patients and her team ensures nothing is done without Dr. Meeta's consultation. I highly recommend Dr. Meeta.

Moreover I was suffering from PCOS and it was my first pregnancy at age of 30 which made me more cautious to choose my ob-gyn. I zeroed upon Dr. Meeta seeing her education and experience. Coincidentally she did her studies from my home town and home state which is one of the best colleges to get for medical studies. 
Beyond expectations Dr. Meeta turn out be even better. Because of following things I feel about her. 
She is very friendly towards her patients. 
She is kinda doctor who helps her patients with not only medicines but also lifestyle, diet and exercises.
I am no expert but I believe pregnancy is all about lifestyle, diet and exercises and medicines are kinda supportive though I was suffering from PCOS.

Above all she is always cheerful even cheered up me in OT when I was in lot of pain :p

With her helps I enjoyed my pregnancy a lot and now I have a little bundle of joy in my arms.

In-fact with her advice , encouragement and precautions , pregnancy continued till the 39th week and delivered a healthy baby.

So when i got pregnant i did not have to think twice to choose her as my gynec. 

Her approach is more related to changing lifestyle than prescribing unnecessary tablets . I also had gestational diebetis which got diagonised in the 1st trimester itself and she guided me through it all through my pregnancy by weekly tracking my diet and sugar levels. I also had IUGR and she gave me realistic expectations around the baby weight and health. 

Overall i would recomend her for pregnancy related care.. Especially if its a high risk pregnancy please do consult her. ",2023-12-03 18:54:23,False,True,Sruthi Menon,,,

I also had vaginal bleeding in my first trimester and then at the later stage was diagnosed with umbilical vein varix which is a very very rare condition.

My Dr Meeta Chawhan is very supportive, experienced and guided to us very nicely at every stage of my pregnancy. 
During my first and second trimester of my  pregnancy , I was consulting Dr Kamal Unikrishna. But In last trimester she refuse to take my case, reason best known to her only.  Me and my husband were in shocked and feared due to her non- professional behavior.
Then we rushed to C9 Whitefield, they advised us to contact Dr Meeta Chawhan. When we met Dr. Meeta Chawhan and discuss our case and problem in detail with her, then she told us ""Need not to worry, I am taking you case"". She investigate my case very sincerely and seriously and gave us clear information and guidelines for normal delivery. She also gave us her personal number and said "" You can contact me any time in case of emergency "".  It make us relaxed. 
After that I contact her so many times over phone for my queries in odd and normal hours. Every time she replied to my queries positively and satisfied me with proper guidelines. 
On my delivery day I went to the hospital in evening but she was not present there at that time. But as the team of C9 informed her about my condition, She immediately rushed toward hospital and, attended and handled my case very efficiently. Finally I gave birth to healthy baby boy (3.4 Kg) through normal delivery. 
Really me and my husband are very thankful to Dr. Meeta Chawhan who helped, handled and guided us time to time very professionally, efficiently and positively. 
Thus I would say that Dr Chawhan is well experienced, nice, very professional who guides properly to all the patients.

She even attended patients (was one of them) when she was expected to be at home for personal difficult time during covid. It’s a very unique in any doctor. 
Regarding her treatment, I was completely new in this as was first time expecting . But the way she handled I followed her each and every suggestion. Rather I would say I blindly followed her prescription and her suggestion in every visit. She always suggested natural things for any complications during pregnancy. And trust me it worked so well, my complete journey was very smooth. . I did not gain any extra weight after delivery. I can share my true feelings about her. 
After delivery check up also she was very right to the point. She gives her patient very well diagnosed comments. Even when I was worried for many reasons she helped me to overcome very easily. She has very good patience and tight attitude to understand our mind. Highly ethical person. 
After delivery I truely missed her visit.  Suggesting her for pregnancy is a very small gesture. She is wonderful, if you are new in Bangalore, please just go to her and she ll handle well till the moment you hear your baby’s voice.

I was very scared that something might go wrong but everytime I met her, all my tensed nerves calmed down. ** ***** ***** ********* *********** ********* ** ***** *** always suggests natural remedies as the first treatment. She answered all my queries with patience, no matter how silly they were. I had a low lying placenta and was always worried, but Dr Meeta would sense the worries in every check up and instill positivity in me and my husband. I would recommend her to every woman who wants to be in good hands during pregnancy. She definitely makes you feel safe and never forces for anything that one is not comfortable with. Doctor definitely connects very well with her patients and this is what every patient aspires for during the pregnancy journey. Thank you so much doctor for taking good care of us and helping my family to meet our baby girl. ",2022-10-07 07:32:52,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I was having gestational diabetes. Baby's weight was also low. Till the end of 39th week, I didn't induce labor and also baby was not down due to a cord around the baby's neck.  Overall it was not normal. 
But the way she motivates you to keep doing the efforts, the treatment she provided, it helped me alot. My baby was born with a good health and weight . I am also fine after the operation. 
Personally, she makes me feel like a elder sister who will motivate you and push you for making the effort.  You will have the problem but she will make you feel like you can easily go through it. She will always say a line "" are kuch nhi h, Aaram se ghr jao"" ☺ she is highly proffesional with her work specially the ""OT"". The way she deals either with her team in OT or the patient, it is appreciable. Even if you go to the hospital in emergency or you didn't get to meet her, junior doctor will treat you and she will have all the information about your health even without meeting you.

Like if you went to do some test in the hospital premise you won't be able to show result/ quick consult with the Doctor without waiting.3. There is even followUp charge (half of the consultation fee during the first 6 days after consultation) for small queries that Doctor prescribes if you don't followUp on the same day. Even if you want to followup on the same day, the Doctor is not going to have a free slot.4.

During my pregnancy i faced some other health issues as well and Dr asked me to take few natural home remedies which helped me to cure my ailments, which i really appreciate.
And i was consulting with Dr as per our schedule to ensure the baby is doing well by doing regular scans and blood tests.
During my 9th month she informed us,
that there could be chances of issue, if we opt for Normal delivery and she clearly explains the risk factor involved in it.
So we decided to opt for LSCS and confirmed the same to Dr and operation was scheduled and i delivered my little angel under Dr Meet Chauhan supervision and both of us are doing really good now.
