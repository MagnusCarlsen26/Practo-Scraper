From our first consultation to the joyous day of delivery, Dr. Harsha and her team at Cloudnine & Prudent Clinic provided unwavering support, expertise, and compassion at every step of the way.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Harsha apart is her commitment to promoting a positive birthing experience. Thanks to her guidance and encouragement, I was able to achieve a normal delivery, an outcome that exceeded my expectations and was made possible by her expertise and support. \n\nIn addition to her exceptional medical expertise, Dr. Harsha also possesses a warm and caring demeanor that immediately puts her patients at ease. She takes the time to listen, educate, and address any concerns, making each visit a positive and empowering experience. On top of that she doesn't take an appointment if she can't give at least 15 mins to a patient. Her comprehensive approach to pregnancy care ensured that I felt informed about each and every complexity during the entire term. And the best part was she never recommended any unnecessary scans or blood tests or medication during the term. We started her consultation from the second month onwards as we didn't have quite a good experience with another gynaecologist prior to her..\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Harsha V. Reddy to anyone seeking personalized, compassionate, and expert pregnancy care. Thank you, Dr. Harsha, for helping to make my pregnancy and delivery experience truly memorable and joyous",

My blood group is O-ve which is very rare, for that she explained the procedures and medications which I needed to take during my pregnancy so that there should not be any harm to my growing baby and me as well, and she personally made sure on my delivery date that blood has been arranged and store before hand.she was always available over email/phone 24*7, I have called her midnight also and she \nresponded my call. she will be very clear about each and every step to be taken with all medication,she will go through the old records every time to make sure everything is in line and than only she will go for next step to be taken. No unnecessary medicines prescribed by her. she  is so disciplined and she will always come on time to attend her appointments, and she informs before hand if she is in any emergency and wont be able to come, which is very appreciable.  I used to be so excited for my each and every appointment because every time she will explain something very knowledgeable topic about baby growth and treatment.    \nI wanted to have normal delivery, for that we asked so many times the chances for me to have normal delivery, and she always responded positively with patience, she told in two cases only c-sec will be done if any serious complication is there and second if I give up!. Under her consultancy I didn't faced any complication and had a normal delivery. when I was in labour full nyt she was monitoring my case and guiding on duty doctor and nurses over the phone what steps to be taken and at what time, which is very appreciating. Even after my delivery she came for \npost delivery check up and made sure m fine, and on next visit after my discharge she explained about what all things I should take care, which will help me to recover fast.      \nshe went for some 4 days of training near about my due date, and before leaving she made sure that I am all ryt and if in case any emergency comes she made sure that her colleague Dr Pooja Rathi will take care of my case,she explained Dr Pooja everything about my pregnancy, and introduced us to her. And she told that she will be available for me 24*7 over the phone if it is needed, which eventually was not required. Finally my baby came through her hands only. There are so many such big and small examples I can give about Dr Harsha which we experienced during my whole pregnancy, I highly recommend Dr Harsha for pregnancy related cases. we can't thank enough to Dr Harsha for everything she did. it is not just because I had normal delivery, I would have been thankful to her even if would had c-sec, she would have done it for me and my baby's safety.\nThank you ma'am, you are the best.\n  \n\n ",

She is thoroughly ************** compassionate, and gives information that is clear and easily followed as a patient.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, we had a serious complication around week 27/28, which landed me on bedrest for the remainder of the pregnancy, most of which was spent in the hospital itself. While I was in the hospital, I saw Dr. Harsha every day, during which she provided medical attention, but also made sure that I was doing ok emotionally. I really can\u2019t imagine going through this pregnancy without her support and guidance. Her ******* ********* *** attention was phenomenal; her diligence and skill allowed us to relax, knowing that if there was any serious concern, she would quickly respond and make a plan.\n\nToday we have a happy and healthy 5 month old. I have been slow to write this review, because I\u2019m not sure that my words are big enough to convey just how important Dr. Harsha was in our baby\u2019s healthy delivery. As we celebrate each of our little one\u2019s milestones, we always think of this wonderful doctor; we know how differently things could have gone if we had not been so fortunate to have Dr. Harsha\u2019s expertise during this crucial time. Thank you Dr. Harsha for everything, we are beyond grateful for all the ways you helped us.",

She is incredibly compassionate and empathetic, making me feel at ease throughout my visits. During my treatment, she demonstrated a high level of skill and confidence, which further instilled trust and comfort in her care.\nMoreover, Dr. Harsha was always accessible, even outside of regular appointment times. She promptly responded to any concerns I had, which greatly alleviated my anxiety. Her dedication to her patients is evident in every interaction.\n\nOverall, my health outcomes have been excellent in my pregnancy journey and we welcomed healthy baby last month, and I attribute this to Dr. Harsha's meticulous care and attention to detail. I highly recommend Dr. Harsha V Reddy to anyone seeking a knowledgeable, compassionate, and reliable gynecologist and obstetrician.",

She is very thorough in her analysis by doing multiple number of tests as needed to narrow down the problems.\n\nBest thing about her is she is very professional and quite prompt in replying her emails or answering her calls. \n\nI definitely recommend her to anyone for prenatal care.

Thanks to her guidance and encouragement, I was able to achieve a normal delivery, an outcome that exceeded my expectations and was made possible by her expertise and support. \n\nIn addition to her exceptional medical expertise, Dr. Harsha also possesses a warm and caring demeanor that immediately puts her patients at ease. She takes the time to listen, educate, and address any concerns, making each visit a positive and empowering experience. On top of that she doesn't take an appointment if she can't give at least 15 mins to a patient. Her comprehensive approach to pregnancy care ensured that I felt informed about each and every complexity during the entire term. And the best part was she never recommended any unnecessary scans or blood tests or medication during the term. We started her consultation from the second month onwards as we didn't have quite a good experience with another gynaecologist prior to her..\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Harsha V. Reddy to anyone seeking personalized, compassionate, and expert pregnancy care. Thank you, Dr. Harsha, for helping to make my pregnancy and delivery experience truly memorable and joyous",

My blood group is O-ve which is very rare, for that she explained the procedures and medications which I needed to take during my pregnancy so that there should not be any harm to my growing baby and me as well, and she personally made sure on my delivery date that blood has been arranged and store before hand.she was always available over email/phone 24*7, I have called her midnight also and she \nresponded my call. she will be very clear about each and every step to be taken with all medication,she will go through the old records every time to make sure everything is in line and than only she will go for next step to be taken. No unnecessary medicines prescribed by her. she  is so disciplined and she will always come on time to attend her appointments, and she informs before hand if she is in any emergency and wont be able to come, which is very appreciable.  I used to be so excited for my each and every appointment because every time she will explain something very knowledgeable topic about baby growth and treatment.    \nI wanted to have normal delivery, for that we asked so many times the chances for me to have normal delivery, and she always responded positively with patience, she told in two cases only c-sec will be done if any serious complication is there and second if I give up!. Under her consultancy I didn't faced any complication and had a normal delivery. when I was in labour full nyt she was monitoring my case and guiding on duty doctor and nurses over the phone what steps to be taken and at what time, which is very appreciating. Even after my delivery she came for \npost delivery check up and made sure m fine, and on next visit after my discharge she explained about what all things I should take care, which will help me to recover fast.      \nshe went for some 4 days of training near about my due date, and before leaving she made sure that I am all ryt and if in case any emergency comes she made sure that her colleague Dr Pooja Rathi will take care of my case,she explained Dr Pooja everything about my pregnancy, and introduced us to her. And she told that she will be available for me 24*7 over the phone if it is needed, which eventually was not required. Finally my baby came through her hands only. There are so many such big and small examples I can give about Dr Harsha which we experienced during my whole pregnancy, I highly recommend Dr Harsha for pregnancy related cases. we can't thank enough to Dr Harsha for everything she did. it is not just because I had normal delivery, I would have been thankful to her even if would had c-sec, she would have done it for me and my baby's safety.\nThank you ma'am, you are the best.\n  \n\n ",

She is thoroughly ************** compassionate, and gives information that is clear and easily followed as a patient.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, we had a serious complication around week 27/28, which landed me on bedrest for the remainder of the pregnancy, most of which was spent in the hospital itself. While I was in the hospital, I saw Dr. Harsha every day, during which she provided medical attention, but also made sure that I was doing ok emotionally. I really can\u2019t imagine going through this pregnancy without her support and guidance. Her ******* ********* *** attention was phenomenal; her diligence and skill allowed us to relax, knowing that if there was any serious concern, she would quickly respond and make a plan.\n\nToday we have a happy and healthy 5 month old. I have been slow to write this review, because I\u2019m not sure that my words are big enough to convey just how important Dr. Harsha was in our baby\u2019s healthy delivery. As we celebrate each of our little one\u2019s milestones, we always think of this wonderful doctor; we know how differently things could have gone if we had not been so fortunate to have Dr. Harsha\u2019s expertise during this crucial time. Thank you Dr. Harsha for everything, we are beyond grateful for all the ways you helped us.",

Her attention to detail, proactive approach in addressing concerns, and clear communication instilled confidence in every step of the process. Her ability to explain complex medical details in a way that was easily understandable was invaluable to me, providing a sense of confidence and reassurance during what was an emotionally charged time.\n\nDr. Harsha went above and beyond in monitoring my pregnancy, addressing potential concerns with a proactive and thorough approach. Her attention to detail and commitment to my well-being and that of my baby was evident at every stage. I always felt like I was in capable hands, and the level of trust that developed between us was crucial in navigating the complexities of my situation.\n\nShe took the time to listen to my concerns, patiently answer my questions, and provide emotional support when needed.

There was also a pre-term risk in my pregnancy along with a cervical polyp which added to the complications. This time I did not wish to take any chances. It was good fortune that I got Dr. Harsha's reference through a close friend of mine. He had assured me that she was one of the best. And he was RIGHT!\nFrom the first consult I was confident that we were in good hands. She is extremely meticulous about her approach. She reviews the complete case history on every visit so that there are no gaps. She reconfirms every single detail. She is also very particular about the tests and medicines and never prescribes anything that is not required. Her constant reassurance helped me to tackle stress and enjoy my pregnancy.\nOn the D day, she was available through the night coordinating with the on call doctors. She was there during the early morning hrs to deliver the baby. Once she was there the delivery was over in no time and I was able to hold my Angel. It was a Normal Vaginal Delivery.\nI have no words to express my gratitude for her. The impression that she has left upon me is indelible. She is one of the most admired people not just as a doctor but as a person. Thank you Dr. Harsha, we love you!",

From the very beginning, she displayed an impressive level of knowledge and expertise in her field. Her dedication to promoting and supporting normal deliveries, when medically suitable, truly sets her apart as a gynaecologist.\n\nThroughout my prenatal visits, Dr. Harsha Reddy was meticulous in gathering and analyzing my medical history, ensuring that she had a comprehensive understanding of my health and pregnancy-related concerns. This attention to detail instilled a sense of confidence in her ability to provide the best possible care for both me and my baby.\n\nOne of the standout qualities of Dr. Harsha Reddy is her commitment to encouraging and facilitating normal deliveries, provided that the medical readings support it. She clearly prioritizes the well-being of both the mother and the child and seeks to avoid unnecessary interventions whenever possible. This approach was particularly reassuring to me as a first-time mother, knowing that she was advocating for a natural birth experience if it was safe to do so.\n\nDuring the delivery itself, Dr. Harsha Reddy exhibited a calm and composed demeanor, which helped ease my nerves and made the process less daunting. Her support and guidance during labor were invaluable, and she navigated the situation with utmost professionalism and care.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Dr. Harsha Reddy to any expectant mother seeking a knowledgeable and compassionate gynaecologist. Her dedication to patient care, thoroughness in gathering patient history, and preference for normal delivery when suitable make her an outstanding healthcare professional. I am grateful for her expertise and support throughout my pregnancy journey, and I cannot thank her enough for helping bring my baby into this world safely and naturally.",

When I met dr. Harsha with my previous reports (6th month of pregnancy) she has gone through all the reports, explained the situation and asked to continue same tablets, encouraged me to have healthy diet and excersise. My second and third trimester journey was really smooth bcos of her advices. \nAt the end of third trimester she explained clearly abt all the scenarios of delivery process. When I was in 39th weeks ,she said that baby weight is seems to be higher than normal range if we wait till natural labour pains then baby might gain more weight in that case labour process would be difficult. So she said will induce labour and try for normal delivery if not possible will go for C-section. \nOn the of delivery she suggested me to get one more scan. By seeing those reports ( baby's weight and head circumference was large) she suggested and clearly explaind that NVT would be difficult if we proceed with that it may hurt baby, will go for C-section. My family also agreed for C-section bcoz baby was too large and we want our baby to be safe. Then finally we accepted for C-section but we wanted the operation on a particular time. Finalised time slot, on the day of operation she was exactly on time and operation also completed on scheduled time. We were blessed with a cute and healthy baby boy. \nWe were very happy and very much satisfied with Dr's service. We always remember her and would defenatly recommend dr. Harsha to my friends and family members. \nThank you soo much doctor. ",

My initial  treatment started in home town because we were working from home during COVID. When my husband's office started and we came down to Bangalore, I was really concerned about changing doctor during my 5th month of pregnancy. I did all my research before meeting her and was too much worried about how will she react after knowing that I am changing doctor at this time. But there she was, too much calm and she went through all my previous reports one by one and made a note of all of it. She was very clear in her instructions. Also, the most important thing was she didn't change or added any of my medicines.\n\nI know it's gonna be a long story here but after few more visits, I got infected with COVID. She used to respond to all my emails and gave proper instructions. Also, at around 7th month of my pregnancy, in my scan I was diagnosed with short cervix and I was having gestational diabetes as well. She gave clear instructions on what could happen and asked me to follow strict diet and complete bedrest. Also, I could deliver prematurely, so she gave medicines and injections accordingly so that I can deliver at the right time.\n\nI followed complete bed rest, blood sugar monitoring and strict diet during pregnancy. And with her help, there came when I was into my 37th week and I went to her for 9th month check up. She examined me physically and said that I am already 2cm dilated. She asked me to get admitted on the same day as I was going to deliver today. I was really worried and was literally sweating. But she seemed excited of me delivering at the same day. At around 8 PM in evening, I got admitted to hospital and around 12 AM , I was fully dilated. I was not able to push for around 2 hrs, but there she was giving her clear instructions and she had to wait 2 hrs for me to push. She was still calm in her words and didn't shouted even once. She was always saying that you can do it. With all her help I could deliver normally at around 2 am in the morning. I am really blessed to be consulting with such a good doctor. As a human being also, she is  quite good. \nAgain I am going to meet her tomorrow. I delivered my baby on 12 May 2022.",

Reading these reviews I was convinced that she dedicates her time to your case, does thorough check on med history and prepares a personalised consultation routine.\u2028I experienced the above when I consulted for early pregnancy in Sept 2019. Dr. Harsha advised me on the nutrition and supplements. Based on ultrasound scan reviews and pregnancy progress she revised the medications, nutrition info, supplements and exercise routines. But she never has advised on medicines or scans unnecessarily... \u2028She has a calming presence which helps soothe anxious moms like me. She will ask if you have doubts or anxiety at every visit.\u2028With COVID-19 restrictions coming in early 2020, visits to Clinic had to be reduced. I was glad that the video consultations with Dr. Harsha helped keep the health routines in check. During 3rd trimester, for physical consultations, Dr. Harsha provided overview of future consultations so that all bookings including scans could be advance booked. \u2028Nearing delivery, she would check in on me and be available on call as well as come to the clinic for any unplanned checkup.\u2028We had opted for natural delivery and Dr. Harsha was committed to easing the process for us. Since I went into labor before the due date, she examined and  advised to get admitted for delivery and really calmed me down. Dr. Harsha and labour room team were by my side through the labor and delivery. They kept me motivated and focused on the natural delivery and supported me (emotionally, mentally and physically) throughout.\u2028I thank her for being by my side through this journey and helping us bring our bundle of joy to the world.",

We were planning for kid and had some issues including miscarriage in past, my friends \n even suggesting for IVF as an option to avoid further delay but with her expert advice, in the same month we got pregnant without any special/expensive treatment and our journey began.During the pregnancy doctor advised right medicines, diet and activities to ensure both remain healthy. She would ask all relevant questions and pay very close attention to each aspect and keep the couple educated and confident. We got her best support through out the pregnancy.When my wife was admitted for delivery, she was not there in the hospital owing to covid situation and I was worried but what I realised soon is she is in constant touch with the patient and the staff (literally 24x7) and though she were to perform the surgery next day, she was there in the hospital same day evening coz she felt something isn\u2019t right and after her inspection, she explained that the baby have passed urine and we shouldn\u2019t wait for normal delivery and got the csection done.Baby and the mother were doing good after the surgery, the stitches were hardly seen, that\u2019s how perfectly the surgery was done. It\u2019s 2 months now, everything is fine and this wouldn\u2019t be so smooth had we consulted any other doctor.\nShe is an angel for us! And more than me it\u2019s important what my wife feels....I was in complete aww when my wife told that Harsha mam spoke to her as a friend and took care of her as a mother.***** ******* good human being, caring, ********** sincere and serious for each patient!!!

Overall, it was a great experience to go through the paternity under the guidance of Harsha and we would like to recommend Harsha for couples looking for normal and healthy delivery.\nConsultation: \nWe started consulting Dr Harsha from 1st month of pregnancy. Harsha helped us with the overall consultations, open suggestions on the tests which are mandatory and tests which can be nice to have etc. We expressed our wish to go for normal delivery and she started providing the tips like regular exercises, balanced diet and managing the sleep cycles etc.\nAfter 7th month, she was able to help us with video calls due to covid. During 9th month, we went to hospital only for the mandatory tests/ checkups.\n\nDelivery: \nMother got the labour pain on the previous night and got hospitalized by 11PM. Doctor Harsha attended us in the hospital and helped with the initial check-ups in the labour room. It was a very long labour of 12+ hours. It was found that the baby's position is complicated and the normal delivery would be difficult. But Dr. Harsha and team was able to help the mother for the normal delivery and the overall experience was really wonderful. Father was also allowed inside the labour room and OT and witnessed the event of joy. \nAfter the delivery, the mother and baby were shifted to the private rooms and Dr visited regularly to check the health of mother and do the inspection of the episiotomy related recovery.\n\nWe are grateful to Dr Harsha for everything. \nThank you Harsha:)\n\n",

This was the first time for us so we were really worried and anxious. However we are really happy and satisfied with her care throughout the pregnancy and post pregnancy.\nI always wanted to have normal delivery and I had followed all advice doc gave to be active, maintain healthy diet and daily walking routine but when i was in labour I requested doctor to go for C- section due to extreme pain. But she explained and encouraged me that you are doing good and your body is responding well there are full chances of delivering normally. She was rigid and decided to proceed with normal delivery. With all my past consultations with her somehow I knew and had faith and confidence on what she says and I followed exactly the way she said and finally later I was so blessed to have baby boy delivered normally.\n \nDuring pregnancy i had complaint of severe abdomen and back pain for which she conducted tests to find the route cause and recommended us to meet gastroenterologist as there were gallstone found in ultrasound to avoid any future complication due to ignorance and later she provided medication.\nShe is crystal clear and explains every necessary required information.\n\nAnother case i had was post delivery was my stitches got infection and i was in tremendous pain.When we visited her she examined and was so concerned and told me in why i didn't call her and had all these pain. Later she gave ****** medication and those were healed. Her intention and care for her patient shows how sincere she is at her work.\nWe are very thankful to her and now i feel a personal bond with her due to her now despite of the fact that it is a doctor patient relationship.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Harsha\ud83d\ude0a\nRegards\nPragati n Kshitij",

I felt very positive and optimistic after meeting her, as it was my first pregnancy and I too had a lot of queries, confusion, fear, tension etc like others. As it was very early, she suggested an early pregnancy scan for me after 4 weeks, but she prescribed the needful medications on that itself and instructed to start having them immediately. After 4 weeks, post scan she confirmed my pregnancy and from then on, the journey continues.We have chosen Dr. Harsha randomly, nobody recommend us. But none of the day, we regretted our decision. She is very positive, friendly, explains each tiny thing very keenly and patiently. On every consultation, she carefully goes through the entries of our last consultation from the file, which implies that she is very responsible and don't want to take the risk of missing anything w.r.t her patients health. She is very approachable through emails with quick responses. She never scared me for anything, instead she always motivated me for normal delivery. As my due date was nearing, she explained to me many scenarios in detail for when to go to hospital. For emergency, she has also provided her mobile number for communication.As her name suggests she brought the same happiness and joy in our lives on Nov 15th, 2019. We were blessed with a baby boy. She has instructed about all the necessary medications post discharge and called for a follow up checkup after a week. We are happy to meet Dr. Harsha and would like to recommend her to all. Trust her, you will be in safe hands.God bless her with good health.Thanks & Regards,Sravani Bharath",

Initially we are not sure , but we decided to proceed with Dr. Harsha Reddy based on her experience and also the locality of hospital. we are so satisfied in such a way that each and every appointment with Doctor increased our trust in her. From our perspective , these are the best experiences we had with the doctor ,1. At what ever time we visited , either at the beginning of her slots or almost near the last slots of the day , she always maintained same energy levels and explained every time very clearly about medicines to be taken with utmost care.2. In the first visit only she explained that,  they will try for normal delivery as first priority.(Happy that finally it's a normal delivery). 3. Very particular about diet control and sugar reading chart when we came to know that gestational diabetes is present. Really happy to see a doctor who herself drew chart with number of days and along with what timings the readings need to be noted (fasting, pre lunch and post lunch and all).4. In the last month of pregnancy, she also explained various scenarios clearly where they cannot proceed with normal delivery , just for our clarity. And also signs when we need to get admitted in hospital.5. Finally when we got admitted in hospital, we are very happy and thankful for the help she did. she visited in night 8PM apart from her daily visits and gave support over phone even at midnight 1AM and again came back by morning 5.30 AM for operation.Finally we are blessed with a baby girl on September 12, 2019. Heartful thanks to Dr. Harsha Reddy for her support throughout the pregnancy.",

We visited her in my second trimester while after decided to change our gynae. We had our reservations when we came to her but all those were gone in the first two meetings. Not only she was quick to peruse through our history but was prompt in recommending us must have tests to ensure the baby was fine. I was on some meds due to existing medical conditions and she informed me that I should stop it and she referred us to to right doctors all of whom were best doctors in Bangalore. Without her help i would not have been able to overcome those meds. She has been an immense pillar of support through out my pregnancy. She listens to all your queries patiently and never writes a test if it's not required.Immediate response on phone calls /emails.Speaking to her during my pregnancy was like sharing everything with an elder sister. She composes you always and encourages you no matter what. I was in labour for 6 long hours and it was getting difficult so i requested her to. Please do a c section. Her response still echoes in my head- you have withstood the pain for 6 hours and give me one more hour to monitor things as if i want to do a c section all it needs is a couple of cuts and stitches and i could have done it 2 days back and not asked you to go through this ordeal. She did take 1.5 hours and ensured that i had a normal delivery when i wanted an easy way out. Without her support my pregnancy would have been very tough leave alone the question of delivery. We as a couple can't muster enough words to thank her. She is not only a great and thorough professional who excels at her trade but above all a great human being. Dr Harsha we are indebted to you and meeting you was one pleasure we had",

I have fallen in love with the Dr for the way she had taken care of me through out the pregnancy. We had chosen Dr. Harsha for our second pregnancy after reference from one another Dr who we know very well and we were glad that we have chosen the right Dr. Totally down to earth and humble person but also professional . Took personal care of me through out the pregnancy and made sure every single point through out my pregnancy is taken care with utmost care. My pregnancy is categorised as a high risk one as I had this condition in heart which is known as Hypertrophy cardiomyopathy HCM.Dr in our first visit took a complete notes of my medical history and also the way how first pregnancy was handled. Every time we visited the Dr she revised the entire notes and she will be ready with the next set of plan for us. As it is a high risk pregnancy the Dr was available over phone 24*7 and whenever I called her she listened to the symptoms and guided appropriately. She did a lot of research on my heart condition and was very confident that she is going to do a normal delivery with less labor time and without epidural as it is not advised for people with HCM. There was a big effort that went into getting us the right facilities. The  way she conducted my delivery was awesome as there was one another lady went in to labor in the same time.  The Dr toggled between two different locations and made sure both the deliveries were successful and normal. Post delivery care and follow up was very satisfactory and I would highly recommend the Dr for pregnancy and any gyneac related issues and I am sure you will love the Dr. A few things cannot be expressed by words but suffice to say that we treasure this association with the Doctor.

If not for Dr. Harsha's professional guidance we would have been rendered a childless couple. We believe Dr. Harsha had gone that extra mile to make our life happy for which we were blessed with a wonderful girl baby. Not a single day passes without we remembering Dr. Harsha whenever we see our smiling angel.\n\nWe were always late to visit Dr. Harsha for our consultation given the notorious Bangalore Traffic. But Dr. Harsha never showed her complaint even in her gesture. Dr. Harsha please accept our sincere apologies now :)\n\nOn the day of delivery during those anxious moments Dr. Harsha was very patient to answer all our concerns. We remember she had come to the hospital very early to ensure we felt assured that we had no reasons to be worried about the operation. Even during the operation our patience was  tested cause i encountered severe blood loss and ended up with a complicated C-Section.God's blessing in the form of Dr Harsha finally resulted in successful surgery  and our difficult times came to and end and happy times begun with little princess in our hand.\n\nWe are ever grateful to Dr. Harsha for all her support, help, guidance and most importantly for giving us that hope that we could bear a child. Thank your Dr. Harsha. ",

I started consulting her when I was second month pregnant. Starting right from the first day we visited her she listens all the family medical history and everything which is related to your pregnancy or your health.She starts her guidance step by step and always keep in mind the health of the mother and the child. During my pregnancy I had lot of health concerns but she was the one who was very confident enough and always provided me with the correct health solution as well as emotional mental support which is very less seen in doctors now a days.. She always responded to my emails and phone calls. And when my due date was near, to my surprise she herself used to call me up and used to take update each day and guide me over the phone which used to give me more strength and confidence. I still remember the day when I was in labour and she was over the phone the entire night guiding the duty doctor what step needs to be taken. That day an emergencey case also came and the lady who came was also Dr. Harsha patient. As soon as the doctor heard about this emergency case she rushed to the hospital at around 3 at night and served her responsibilities towards the other lady who came. Now a days where doctors are more concerned about Money, I can assure and guarantee that Dr harsha is a doctor who knows her ethics towards her profession and serves the patient keeping in mind their well being. The reason why I am saying this because I was unable to progress in my labour even after 12 hours and hence c section was needed to be done. But Dr. Harsha was the person who said no she would be doing normal delivery and for that we need to wait for more 3 to 4 hours. But my destiny was something else. I had to go c section. I was being taken to the OT and anesthesia was already given still the doctor asked me that she wants to wait for more 3 to 4 hours and that she could take me back to the labour room and wait. Infact she went out and approached my husband and said the same thing to him that she is confident that normal delivery is possible. But as I said destiny have something else written and I have to go c section. Her duties towards her patinet doesn't end here she will also take care her patients after the post delivery and guide the mother each and every thing giving her motivation, positivity and strength to recover fast. Words are less to express what a wonderful doctor she is. I was very lucky and blessed to have a doctor like her beside me everytime and will be thankful to her till my last breath. Our gratitude towards her will always be there. Lots of love and happiness mam.From Raina, Tarun and the lil angel Aahana",

Dr. Harsha reviewed all my previous reports and took ample time to ensure my comfort and understanding. She patiently addressed all my queries and thoroughly explained each step of the process. Initially, she aimed for a normal delivery, but at my 32 nd week scan, when the baby was in breach position, Dr. Harsha advised waiting until the 36th week to see if the baby turned. Unfortunately, the baby didn't turn, so we opted for a planned C-section in 38 th week .Throughout my pregnancy journey, Dr. Harsha's expertise and professionalism shone brightly. She provided exceptional care during my C-section delivery. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Harsha V Reddy to anyone in search of a skilled and caring gynecologist for their delivery needs.",

She was always straight to the point, explained everything very well, did not give unnecessary medicines/ tests, . At the start of every consultation, she would go through all the previous records/ history and then explain the next steps, and patiently answer all the queries one would have. She would never hurry up unlike most other doctors and give all the time needed. I had thyroid, PCOD issues, and my pregnancy and delivery went quite smooth because of her advice. In the 9th month of pregnancy, the baby had 3 nuchal cords (3 loops of umbilical cord around the neck) and we thought normal delivery would now not be possible. However, Dr Harsha was able to do a normal delivery for me despite the complications. We are very grateful to Dr Harsha, and going ahead with her was one of the best decisions we made.\n\nWe were really lucky to have her as our doctor and I would highly recommend her to everyone.",

Mine is a 3 year long gynec & fertility related journey with Dr. Harsha. We were married for 9 years & had unknown infertility. To that Dr. Harsha has put us through step by step process in order to identify the problem & treat us accordingly. She neither once rushed us through any treatment in hurry, nor did she prescribe medicines unless necessary. I conceived through IVF & ended with a miscarriage in 2021, Dr really went on her toes to help me through this. I conceived again in 2022 and that was a super high risk pregnancy with issues popping up every 2 weeks, but she stood like a rock by my side explaining all the emergency medication/treatment given and made me deliver a healthy baby girl in Dec\u201922. We are really lucky to be treated by her & I highly recommend everyone to entrust your faith in her safe hands and be rest assured. If you ever get to read this Dr. Harsha - Can\u2019t thank you enough for all that you have done in delivering the little bundle of joy in our lives, We LOVE YOU. \nKameswari & Mayukh",

On our first visit itself, we were impressed by her approach. She went through my past reports and made notes of  all the details provided, as well as had a detailed discussion with us about my medical history. She was more than happy to answer all our questions in detail and explained why a particular test had to be done. I had complications during my pregnancy but she handled everything perfectly. We developed complete trust on her as each time she would explain the reasons behind the complications. She followed a safe approach with us and referred us to specialist doctors so that all corners are covered for all the special situations. She went on leave during last days of my pregnancy but she briefed another doctor on my case and told us that she would be available over call for any emergency. There was no issue while she was on leave and we got our baby delivered by her last month. On the day of delivery as well, she was in complete control of the situation and was in constant touch with the attending doctor. In addition to this, she was quick in turning up to the hospital as needed. I would definitely recommend her to all parents, especially the first timers who want someone to handle their case with complete confidence.",

Dr. Reddy's positivity was a constant source of encouragement, creating a calm and hopeful atmosphere throughout.\n\nThanks to Dr. Reddy's dedication, I successfully delivered my baby through normal delivery, and both my child and I are thriving.

She took care of my pregnancy with utmost care (sometimes even more than I could have done myself), ensured all my vitals are under control through proactive checks and medications. She prepared me well before delivery by patiently explaining how it is going to be. She was really invested in my pregnancy which I feel is really important for a patient. With all her relentless effort I was able to deliver a healthy baby through C section. I can't thank the doctor enough for making my pregnancy journey so effortlessly beautiful and bringing this joy in our lives. I highly recommend her for high risk pregnancies. Thank you Doctor, you really let miracles happen !",

I have consulted her during my pregnancy and realised I had a severe complication of multiple fibroids. However, She always kept us abreast on what complications we can expect at each stage and have given a proper treatment for the same. The treatment she had prescribed had not only helped me in controlling the side effects of fibroids but also maintained the health of the baby during the course of the pregnancy. We were expecting a pre term labour right from the start (possibly from 7th month onwards) which did happen right after I crossed my 8th Month in pregnancy. Because Dr Harsha kept telling us in every visit on the possible implications of the same, we were mentally prepared for such a scenario. Dr Harsha has performed a C section and it went very smoothly albeit there were many challenges for doing the same.  We had a pre term baby girl who was born one month earlier than the actual due date. The baby however is doing fine and healthy now. I would definitely recommend Dr Harsha and would like to thank her once again for the service she had provided to us.",

Her investigation in this regard is very keen, she ruled out all causes one by one.

Our experience, from day one, has been nothing less than fabulous. She is very patient in listening your concerns, completely and equally elaborative in explaining the issue and prescription. What we liked most in her that she is a very good human being as much as she's extremely competitive. She's someone who'll never over - prescribe and advises optimum treatment. When we planned to expand our family, it was not an easy journey for us. She helped us throughout the journey and with Almighty's grace, my wife conceived on 25th July 2020. Although we moved to quite distance from Cloudnine Bellandur, we didn't mind commuting frequently to get best advice and treatment from Dr. Harsha. Finally the D Day (10th April 2021) arrived. Dr. Harsha admitted my wife on 9th April and kept her under observation for ~20 hours to induce labour pain. She tried everything possible to ensure natural delivery and with God's Grace, all variables were favourable and my wife delivered a very healthy baby girl, naturally. It is very difficult to express our gratitude towards Dr. Harsha into words. She's more than a family to us *** *** **** **** * **** She's definitely a terrific Gynaecologist in town. May her tribe grow. Thank you doctor",

We can't thank Dr Harsha enough for the help and care she gave us. \nWe visited her for normal health check up, that\u2019s where she guided us on how to plan and start with our pregnancy journey. My double maker test showed high risk of Down syndrome which made us very tensed and uncertain about journey ahead. Dr. Harsha was prompt and confident about the next steps.  She referred us to to right and best doctors in Bangalore that could perform further scans and procedures(aminocentesis). There was definitely a time where we thought of taking other doctors opinion but her support and patience to answer our queries changed our mind. She immediately responds to your queries over mails and also share her phone number close to your due date. At the time of my delivery, she rushed to the hospital within 20 minutes (early morning) post call was made by the ground duty doctor. I still can\u2019t believe that I was able to deliver normally, definitely it\u2019s because I was under right supervision of Dr. Harsha.\n Thank you for all your support and advice.",

Major factors are Doctor's explanation, communication and friendliness. ********* ************* *** amazing patience to hear us out. And give us timely advice even if its a trivial question. And these are really good ones, they helped me cope up with lot of things physically and mentally as well. My second pregnancy had fair bit of complications along with being O-ve. She herself made sure there's enough blood available in case of emergency not depending on hospital staff. Incredible. Me and my husband would recommend her any day.

She has been an excellent doctor and a guide to us from the starting of our pregnancy to the birth of our baby.\nDuring each visit she used to take a couple of mins to walk us through the complete history of pregnancy which always gave us a sense that all the decisions taken during treatment, whether small or big are always well calculated, not just based on the current situation.\nShe is also always very precise in her instructions along with the reasons she has considered for guiding us. There is never any ambiguous direction given by her or without any reason, this has always inspired a great confidence for us that we are heading in the right direction.\nIn the majority of pregnancies, parents are hoping for a normal delivery. And although we did end up with a normal delivery without any complications thanks to her expertise, one thing we particularly appreciate is the way she prepared us for the delivery. She told us very clearly about the situations where delivery will be normal and how to prepare ourselves for it or the situations where it will end up in a c-section for reasons which can't be controlled.\nWe have had a complicated history and have been to quite a few gynecologists in the past. We were lucky enough to find her as our doctor at last and haven't had any doubts since then. ",

When we first visited her, she went through all the previous reports and scans and wrote it all in the prescription sheet and then she started the conversation. She checks the asked reports/scans after that (if any) and explains the results(good or bad). During Followups, we understood that this is her routine to start with going through all the prescription sheets first and then proceed and prescribe anything.  She use to listen all our problem and concerns patiently (This is our first baby so had a lot of questions/concerns ), and explains all to our satisfaction. \nDuring delivery also, she tried all she can for the normal delivery considering it was early delivery, but after trying all she can and waited, she went with C-Section with our confirmation only and handed our life, our baby to us.\nThe feeling we had after seeing/holding our baby, we can't Thank you enough for that mam.\nTo conclude,  if anyone is seeing this post, you can blindly trust and visit Dr. Harsh for your concerns.\n\nTHANK YOU mam.",

I had a missed abortion in 2017 we met for the first time with her for DnC. She handled me very calmly and explained my case. Then I planned for my next pregnancy in 2019 we were in touch from the starting with her.*** ***** **** ** *********** ********* everything was going very smooth this time. She used to listen me patiently and clear all my doubts.I always wanted a normal delivery and when the day came I was in labour but my cervix wasn't dialating she gave me all the medicines she could for dilating It was almost 24 hours then I told her to do C-section but then she gave me  confidance u have beared all the pain so let's wait for some time for a normal delivery. She called the best team of cloud nine for my case and helped me a lot and I delivered a baby boy normally on 13th Feb 2020. From starting of my pregnancy she had that confidence that everything will be fine and it happened.I really don't have words to express how thankful I m to her. She cares for her patients and is always available for them. Thanku so much. ",

Since then I continued my entire pregnancy with her without any tension she took care of everything, more than me she was more concered abt how my pregnancy was progessing. I had few complications despite tat I was very happy each time I met her coz I knew she would TC of everything tat was the confidence I got after I met her each time. I'm blessed with a healthy beautiful baby girl on 25th may 2018 all thanks to the all might and doctor harsha. I will be thankful to her my entire life. I had suggested doctor Harsha to my friend they are also very very happy with her. ",

She is very patient and answers each and every query patiently without considering the duration of the consultation. Doesn't prescribe any medicines / tests unnecessarily. Responded actively on emails / calls as required during later stages of pregnancy. 2 days before due date the amniotic fluid levels have gone drastically down (< 6). In such scenarios I have heard that many doctors directly go for C section. However Dr. Harsha has tried as much as possible to make the delivery happen normally and avoid C section. However our baby had to be delivered through C section only due to very slow progress in delivery and the risk associated in delaying it further. Recovery of my wife post delivery is very good and she is able to walk freely within a week. Pains post delivery were also not much. I am very glad that we had our baby delivered by her. I am very very satisfied with our overall experience with her and would highly recommend her to others.",

After our first pregnancy we could not think of any other doctor for our consulting on our 2nd pregnancy. She was a very professional in her consulting on our pregnancy matters. She, for not even once put us in a ambiguous position regarding our plan of treatment. She is very clear and certain about her consulting which is a rare trait in this highly complicated medical consulting environment. Dr. Harsha is a combination of old school and new school of medical consulting. This very nature helped us to completely repose our complete faith in her line of treatment. We never even had to go seeking second opinion due to Dr. Harsha's professional approach. Both our babies were born under normal delivery. This by itself speaks volumes about the commitment of Dr. Harsha to her profession. We live in the world where patience are convinced to select C-Section by doctors at the drop of a hat. But we never experienced this with Dr. Harsha during our 1st pregnancy which made us to resolve that for our 2nd will definitely be consulted by Dr. Harsha.",

We started consulting Dr. Harsha from the time we know that periods got stopped. Dr. Harsha is extremely friendly, patient, always with smiley face and she explained each and every bit of information related to pregnancy related scans, tests,food needs to be taken etc.\n\nI was bit worried personally because my wife is little bit sensitive and not that much strong mentally. Dr. Harsha encouraged my wife and she treated like her own sister. She never allowed to get panic and because of this my wife's confidence levels got boosted. Dr. Harsha is multi lingual and It helped us to talk freely in my native language . \n\nAt one point of time we prepared for C-Section because baby weight was almost close to 4 KG as per scans and two rings appeared around the neck. On Feb 14th night 10 PM Amniotic fluid started leaking and we immediately called doctor and she told us to get admit in hospital. All people in the cloud nine hospital treated very well and Doctor decided to go for normal delivery and we blessed with a healthy baby boy.\n\nI'm recommending Dr. Harsha for all people who wants to enjoy their journey of parenthood.\nWith Lots of love\nPadma Prathyusha & Mahesh Reddy.",

She guided us well in planning our pregnancy and did ask us to do all the required tests like vitamins , blood sugar , scans etc to check if everything is fine for pregnancy. \n\nDuring pregnancy as well she monitored my health very closely and did the required tests as and when necessary. She listened to every complaint( like skin rash, fatigue and breathlessness etc ) and made me do a through check up for every problem throughout pregnancy. \n\nAt every visit , she used to check my records from the start , check my history , understand my case and then go forward with the consultation which I liked the most. She was understanding in terms of my health and concerns like , nausea and fatigue. Also , she made us understand the importance of exercising and walking when required. In all she was very understanding and pushed me to do my best. To add on , I felt she also has a good sense of humor and I always felt good after meeting her, sharing my problems with her and talking to her. We had a discussion with her over trying to have a normal delivery and she was very supportive. Also, she made us aware of the all the scenarios. \n\nOur due date was when there was a alarming\u00a0 flood situation in Bangalore and in that situation also we had discussed alternatives with her where she guided us well. When we got admitted to the hospital at night for the delivery she kept a close check on my health condition in every hour or two and guided us to take correct decisions during the process. Also, she explained the situations to our family throughout the delivery process. After a long labor period , thankfully we were blessed with a healthy baby and the delivery was normal under her guidance. Even after a month of delivery, she monitored my health by making me do all tests and tracked my health well. \n\nThe process of being a mother is the most delicate and vulnerable phase in a women's life and we are very happy to have had Dr. Harsha to guide us through it. I had a lot of trust on her , her knowledge and skills and it was all worth it. A big THANK YOU and a big shout out to Dr Harsha and her Team.\n",

Because of the execssive nausea and vomiting related to HG i was not able to eat anything and lose more than 5% of my body weight. I requested the doctor to give me IV fluids but she ignored my request saying that vomiting are common and it will go away second trimister onwards and will not cause any threat to my pregnancy. My HG lasted till 16 weeks of pregnancy and during that time i lost 3.5kg weight.  17 weeks onwards i started eating a lot thinking that i will not only have to gain more weight for my pregnancy but will also have to get back my lost weight. I was following the standard weight gain recommendation of 1pound each week by international standard. But this doctor discouraged my weight gain and told me if i start getting so much weight then what will happen at 3rd trimister. Because of this at 28 weeks i was only 55kg. Based on my bmi (body mass index) should have been atleast 58.5 kg as per the international standard.\nAs such i broke my water at 32 weeks and my baby was born at 34 weeks 5 days through emergency c-section because of placenta abruption. I was a healthy woman with bmi<24 before pregnancy. And during pregnancy i never had any issue like low Blood pressure or blood sugar.  ***** **** ****** *********** ** ** **** **** ****** ******* ** ***** i had a preterm delivery. My baby came 5 weeks early and was only 1.77kg at birth. He has to spend 15 days in NICU before i could take him home.\nThis doctor always discouraged me to gain more weight while never telling me about the risks associated with low weight gain during pregnancy.  She even monitired my weight gain and told me it was ok whenever i had doubt.\n\n***** *** **** ******* ***** *** *** *********** ****** ****** ***** *** *** ********* ** *** ****** The birth weight of the baby is directly correlated with mothers weight gain during pregnancy. \nYet doctors **** ****** ***** dicourages us to gain appropriate weight during pregnancy *** ******* ************* ***********\n\nI wanted to share my experience with you all. So that you wont have to face this same issue.",

That was making us worry every day & each moment that too we were  out of our home town.\n\nI informed all these health concerns to my family friend/Doctor Dr. M J Jayakanth. Then he immediately advised to consult Dr. Harsha V Reddy in Cloudnine Hospital. So we started consulting Dr. Harsha in  cloudnine hospital, Bellandur branch. After the first consultation, we felt that now someone is with us in Bangalore. Dr. Harsha started all the pre-checks & pro-active health checkups in timely manner.\n\nAs the days passed on, we felt like Dr. Harsha became like our friend & family member. She advised us how to take care of mother & baby on each & every step. Now we are strong enough to plan the delivery\nhere in Bangalore with Dr. Harsha's supervision in cloudnine Bellandur.\n\nFinally, the day came. We were aware that for us it won't be a normal delivery from the 1st day. Just prayed God to help us & on the other hand we have Dr Harsha with us. Dr. Harsh was available during the delivery along with her Team. Delivery got over successfully. Both Mother & baby are well.\n\nThat's not the end. We have to be admitted in hospital for around 5 days. So, the thing we appreciate with Dr. Harsha is she took care of my wife's health post operation also in a timely fashion. I was so happy when she used to call their team in hospital & was asking the health status of my wife each & everytime. Dr. Harsha used to guide their team over phone also as what to do & what Not. So it's all we felt like Dr Harsha is our family member. \n\nNow both mother & baby are doing well. We are living in Bangalore only.\n\nHence, we remain Grateful to Dr. Harsha & we can never ever forget this. She took care of us starting from Pregnancy, delivery/birth, post birth everything. We are proud of Dr. Harsha. We pray God for all her Good & wishing her all the best in her career & life. \n\nThanks,\nSibananda. ",

She explained each and every thing in detail. \n\nWhen the time came, my labor did not progress as expected still she waited even when I lost my hope completely. At end I delivered normally with all the support of her and guidance.\n\nIf we follow whatever she says from the start to end you will have a 99.99% of chance to deliver normal vaginal delivery.\n\nThank you, Dr. Harsha, for being there when it mattered most.",

At times me and my wife were ok for C-Section but her confidence and approach got the normal delivery done. She was always there when needed...be it in call on mail or personal visit. It has never happened during this joirney that she did not amswer our call or message.Her politeness and friendly nature makes people more comfortable. No words can express our gratefulness to her. Me and my wife from the bottom of our heart thank Dr Harsha and would suggest anyone who is looking for the right captain for their wonderful journey to consult her and life would be good !!! More Power to her. Cheers! \n\nOn behalf of Rashmi Mishra, Our Angel Rayna and \nMyself :- Thank You Dr. Harsha \n",

Under her guidance, we never had a doubt, never looked for a second opinion and her support gave us a lot of strength to fight it out.We are extremely happy that we were under her guidance and forever grateful to her.We delivered a baby girl a couple of weeks back.

After hearing from a friend we visited Harsha mam. \nShe explains each and every point thoroughly. After few visits we established a bond with her. She is very much active in mail and used to reply quickly for each queries. She is having a positive vibe and encouraged me to be active and made my journey more smother. She doesn't tell you to do unnecessary tests and never gives any false hopes and has a practical approach. If she \ntells something there is a reason behind it, blindly just follow her.\nFrom day 1 i was looking for a gynac who can support me for normal delivery. But unfortunately my water broke and she tried for `13 hours for normal delivery but my cervix was not getting dilatated due to which we went for C-section. She is now my permanent gynac now. If you are planning for normal or c-sec in Bangalore blindly you can consult her.",

Her thorough and reasoned responses to our questions have been incredibly reassuring.\n\nDuring critical moments in labor, her swift actions and constant communication proved invaluable. She maintained constant contact with the on-call doctors and arrived at the hospital within minutes when urgent assistance was needed.\n\nMy wife and I are very grateful to Dr. Reddy and strongly recommend her to anyone embarking on the pregnancy journey.",

When I was close to my due date, she has asked me to meet once in a week and to call incase of any emergency and clearly explained the labor process.I wasn\u2019t cooperative during internal examination. Due to fear of pain , I opted for c section voluntarily and the operation was done on scheduled time. Thanks a ton for bringing our little bundle of joy into our world\u2764\ufe0f.

She always gave a detailed explanation of the treatment and the possible outcomes, and that helped us understand what was going on and make informed decisions where needed. She was such a boss in the delivery room - managed the entire team (and me) with a clear set of instructions and a no-nonsense approach throughout.

We always wanted normal delivery but we were ready to accept whatever might come and Dr.  Harsha fully supported us.

As my pregnancy progressed, her predictions proved accurate, and following her recommendations significantly improved the smoothness of my pregnancy journey.If you're seeking a gynaecologist who combines expertise, compassion, and patient-centered care, Dr Harsha V is the best choice. I'm grateful to have her as my healthcare provider.",

To be honest i was a very challenging patient. I get stressed pretty easily. But she always explained me everything and made me comfortable with the decisions i should be making and always supported me. Having a normal delivery was out of my mind when i started having issues. But Dr Harsha made it happen. I would say she would be my lifetime gynae. I trust her with everything after the entire pregnancy journey. I honestly highly recommend Dr Harsha. I am really happy and thankful for this experience.",

And I must say She is a wonderful lady who does full justice to her job. During each consultation she goes through all the previous records, clarifies all the doubts and ensures that I follow the proper diet. When I was in the 9th month of my pregnancy, she took off for few days. However,  she handed my case to her colleague for emergency consultation  and I was informed about the same. She was always reachable over phone and mails. When I was close to my due date she explained what exactly the labor is and I was also informed under what circumstances she would go for c-section. Finally I delivered a baby girl and it was normal. Thanks a lot Dr Harsha for all the support and guidance that you extended throughout the journey. It would not have been smooth without you and your care. I am always grateful to you. Thank you once again !!!!! ",

Mam was there throughout our pregnancy journey and when there were times we were low, she supported so much and made sure everything went well. She is very clear on her instructions and explains every minute details why we are doing a particular test/scan. During the time of labor, when we ourselves requested for c-section, mam didn't agree as there were lot of chances having normal delivery. Finally, delivered a baby girl normally. It would have definitely ended up in c-section if it wasn't Harsha mam. Definitely we are thankful for all the positivity and support mam gave us throughout the journey. \nI would strongly recommend Harsha mam if someone is looking out for a gynaec in Bangalore. Will surely thank me later :)",

I consulted doctor Harsha after reading the reviews online and I can say that was the best decision we took. She is very friendly, makes you comfortable  and understands your complete medical history. She will explain each step in detail and listens to you and your queries with patience.\nShe takes all necessary precautions regarding your pregnancy and ensures everything is fine. She's always available on calls and mails no matter what time it is. More than a doctor I would say for us she was no less than an angel who helped us throughout our pregnancy during this pandemic time. I'm thankful to doctor harsha from the bottom of my heart for all her support and guidance. She really gave me a lot of confidence throughout my pregnancy. With her support we are now blessed with a baby girl. Thank you doctor for everything.\n\n",

She was very patient during every visit and explains all small questions asked.  Dr was always available for any of our small concerns or late night worries. More over a doctor , she guided both of us throughout the pregnancy like a mentor. She was so affable and patient over the consultation, I generally used to wait for my regular checkups during my pregnancy. I was an ordinary patient of ordinary means but Dr. Harsha and her team took care of me as if I was the most important person on earth. Thank you So much Dr Harsha, you gave us the most wonderful gift.\n\nI am definitely going to miss your regular checkup sessions.\nI would recommend Dr Harsha to all of them who wants to enjoy their journey of parenthood.\n\nWith Lots OF Love\nSonali , Debasis and Daivik (Happiness of our life)",

We were looking for a doctor to whom we can trust and depend on fully after few recurrent miscarriages and struggling for viable pregnancy. From the very beginning, we started feeling comfortable with her treatment and the way she explained about the entire journey. She was very much reachable over phone during any emergencies and always provided us with the next course of action. She always gave us ample time to clarify all our queries and even was reachable immediately at 2:30 AM when my water broke and took further steps accordingly. In her guidance and care, we were blessed with a baby boy in October 2019. We are tremendously grateful to her for such wonderful care and guidance and would like to recommend her for smooth journey in pregnancy. Her positive strength and stamina always give all the patients a moral boost to overcome any difficulty.",

She listens to us patiently, very energetic, always a smile in her face gave me lot of confidence and strength during my pregnancy and childbirth.She  explains very clearly the condition , what to do what not to do. Dr. Harsha is also very responsible to our emails. Due to covid conditions, few of our consultation were online  which was also worth the discussion. She responds to our calls anytime and had never ignored. During labour also she gave me lot of confidence and strength coz of which I deliverd (Normal) my baby boy within few hours in the month of Feb 2021. * ***** **** ********* ** *** **** ***** *** ****  We can also go for two more kids (Just for laughs) if we have Dr.Harsha V Reddy as our Gynecologist.

She encouraged and motivated me well enough till the end of the delivery which made the overall experience fruitful when I had actually decided on giving up on normal delivery. She had a lot of patience to go through each and every minute detail of my pregnancy and explained the entire process very clearly throughout all her consultations...  Always has responded to all my queries through mail whenever I had any doubts other than consultation hours..The best thing I loved about her is she is very happy and motivated all the time.. I would recommend her to all the pregnant ladies. My friends and family.. ",

Listens patiently to curious first time parents, and answer all questions to their satisfaction\n2. Relies least on medication\n3. Encourages physical activity based on pregnancy stage. Does not restrict things unnecessarily. Provide essential guidelines for traveling\n4. Is available through some medium, and is responsive\n5. Supports the couple through the ups and downs of pregnancy from the fear of the first trimester, till the anxiety of delivery.\n\nThere were multiple instances in the 9 months when the doctor was more of a friend, and we could rely on her without doubt. The delivery went well too, she was extremely articulate in her instructions, and things went relatively smoothly. A big thanks to her for bringing our baby in the world!",

At least with us she had no risk approach which was necessary for us. Even for delivery she pushed for NVD while we ended up with C-section for other reasons. IMO she looks for quality over quantity which is what we needed. ",

Before starting the consultation, checks the complete medical history of the patient. The best part is the positive aura that she has. It always gives positive vibes which is very important especially in pregnancy. She never asked to do any unnecessary test/scan. She tried a lot to make a normal delivery but as things did not progress as expected she took a timely decision for a C-section. Lot more things are there, but being a new mom it's difficult to jot down everything, rather I would suggest consult her and experience it yourself :). You will definitely be in good hands :). I highly recommend Dr Harsha for any gynaec consultation. Lastly, special thanks to Dr. Harsha for all the support.",

Proper guidelines to follow the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019t and critical support when it was emergency. She was always there as a strength and we are glad to met a doctor like her who has tons of experience and a great approach to deal with the situation. We would like to thank from the core of our heart to Dr. Harsha and recommend everyone.\n\nThank You Dr. Harsha!!",

The entire tenure of my pregnancy she had been constantly providing moral support and backing me all the time. What I like in her is the positive response for every question I asked and explanation she gives in detail in a lay man terms.\n\nShe always insisted for normal Delivery. However due to complications in my case I had to undergo C-Section. I know how much she helped me during the delivery and took care of me. I personally connected to her and I strongly recommend her for everyone.\n\nFinally I thank mam for making my Delivery smooth and delivered a healthy baby girl.",

What I liked about her that she was very transparent, she explained me each and everything. In addition to that she never prescribed me any unnecessary medicines. I used to ask  atleast 10 questions during my each visit and she answered all the questions patiently. She was never in a hurry. I had a great 9 months of  experience. Also,  she is very friendly which I feel very necessary for a patient as it helps to communicate with doctor easily. The best part of her is that she is down to earth which is really hard to find such doctors now a days. Please do visit Dr.  Harsha without a single  doubt. I really admire her a lot.  ",

She always patiently listened to my problems and treated me with utmost care. She is very warm, friendly and boosts confidence during pregnancy. If you are planning to have a normal delivery and good care in Bangalore, I suggest you visit Dr.Harsha. She clearly explained every step during my whole pregnancy and I never had any doubts. Her quick response time over e-mails always surprised me. Thank you Dr.Harsha for being with us in this beautiful journey and all the very best to you.",
