None,None,0,0,YES,"I am truly impressed with my experience with Dr. Mala Sibal. Getting an appointment with the doctor was really difficult. Though, I told my problem to the PR staff and luckily got an appointment for aminocentesis. I got my 20 weeks anamoly scan done at diagonistic center and the report says that 20 weeks fetus has short nasal bone, which is a strong indicator for down syndrome. Then, i decided to go for aminocentesis procedure to know whether baby has down syndrome or not. Dr. Mala Sibal did the procedure well, without any pain. Even i didn't get to know when the procedure started and when it ended up. I was completely blown away by how experienced and knowledgle she is and how fast she has done the procedure, most importantly without any pain. I got the procedure done on 27th Jan and on 29 th Jan got the report for FISH test, which says chromosomes 21,18, and 13 all are normal. I am so happy after getting the procedure done Dr. Mala Sibal. She is really knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable throughout the procedure and counselling. She gave me extra time and attention, more than expected. I would highly recommend this doctor. She is extremely intelligent, a compassionate and caring person ,and a truly outstanding doctor. I count myself truly lucky to have found her. 
I would like to thank her and just wanted to share with her that everything is normal in FISH test.",2016-01-30 17:53:00,False,True,Kanika,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"She correctly diagnosed my ovarian malignant tumour and the type which many other Doctors failed to identify. The biopsy reports and her initial diagnosis were matching, I would highly recommend her in case of any critical or rare cases where expertise and experience is needed.",2024-01-05 11:20:30,False,True,Swastika Devendra,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,"I  visited the doctor for a scan and will STRONGLY recommend to seek another option, if you have it. 
I will not recommend the doctor.  She was in a hurry to complete the scan and was rude upon being asked any questions. She took it as if her authority was being challenged. Experience is one thing,  Knowledge is another .The ability to listen and explain with patience is a virtue totally lacking in her. She was curt, unfriendly and by no means, a doctor who you would want to be scanning you or your relatives.",2023-03-26 15:20:18,False,False,Manish,,,

None,"Amniocentesis,",0,0,YES,"First of all I would like to thank Sister Sumitra in Fetal medicine department of Manipal Hospital  for accepting and arranging a visit with doctor at a very short notice considering the urgency of the situation.
Well, now few words about Dr. Mala Sibal. She is a very good doctor  who makes a patient feel trusted towards her.She is very jolly and certainly has expertise in her domain. She does listens to her patients patiently and understands their situation well. Manipal Hospital is far from my home, else I would have definitely changed my doctor for future ultrasounds. 
The process of amniocentesis was also done with great care and precaution by the doctor and the staff there.",2016-05-26 08:51:38,False,True,Priyanka Kaujalgikar,,,
None,"Maternal Fetal Medicine,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Priti Venkatesh is an experieced doctor , we went for second opinion about the amniocentisis / NIPT .

She explained the scenarios in layman terms with utmost clarity and suggested best in our case .
