Review

I started to consult Dr.  Sapna lulla at Ovum hospital during my 4th month of pregnancy, after reading many good online reviews about Dr. Sapna.i had earlier consulted 2 other gynaecs but felt that they lacked the personal touch that I required.  I was on the lookout for a Doctor Who was confident about her decisions and also showed personal interest in me... This is when I met Dr.  Sapna and deciding to continue with her at Ovum hospital was the best decision that my husband and me could take.  From the first consultation onwards,  Dr. Sapna showed a lot of concern and interest in my case as I had developed diabetes.  This did not seem to worry her,  instead she instilled confidence in me from the first day that I could have a healthy n normal pregnancy and could also have a normal delivery.  Dr.  Sapna's sense of confidence in any given situation is the best part about consulting her..  She is a highly skilled,  energetic,  enthusiastic and positive person and she gives a lot of positive energy to the mother to be !
Under Dr. Sapna's guidance,  I was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy ... She is always available and accessible, she had asked me to call her at any point of time during the day or at night if I faced any issues...another great quality of Dr Sapna is that she always recommends natural remedies to normal pregnancy related problems. 
I would confidently state that meeting Dr Sapna was a blessing and she alone was responsible for me to deliver my baby normally without any issues...  She always insists on Going in for a normal delivery and prepares the patient on the same lines from the first consultation. 
I would like to thank Dr. Sapna for being there for me and giving me such a warm and friendly feeling,  I would highly recommend Dr Sapna to any mother to be.  I believe that consulting a genuine and good doctor is the best gift that one can give themselves during the crucial period of pregnancy,  and Dr Sapna is one such genuine and friendly Doctor Who can help you do away with all your pregnancy woes.  
Also a big thank you to all the staff at Ovum hospital,  it's one of the hospitals where you do not feel unnecessarily nervous or tensed being part of a hospital environment..  The nurses always welcome you with a warm and friendly smile and the hospital staff are generally very courteous and helpful.  They give you a personal touch.  I'd like to specially thank Sr. Blessy, Sr. Sally,  Sr. Mamata all of whom have been extremely warm and friendly and have treated me very well.  
Overall,  we have had a great time consulting at Ovum.

Me and my husband were totally confused and rehearsed on what to talk to doctor the next morning. But the situation became a cake walk because of her. There is no room for unwanted wheres and whys we were accepted as if i am her patient from the start.

I delivered my baby boy on Feb 25th 
As per our dream to deliver normal and which is never possible without this wonder women. She made a sensitive girl like me to do it. I never thought i can do it. I had to deliver my boy in 37th week as i had blood spotting and was asked to come to hospital immediately. There onwards she asked me to do all the excercises for the normal delivary. Actually on the same day of my delivery she need to fly to deliver one of her relatives. But she never rushed or handed me over to any other doctor. She is very patient and never left me unattended.  She kept monitoring every now and then. At the nth moment as i couldnt push, she helped me to push. I know i irritated her a lot as all i could hear in my hear is "" push navya push"" but i couldn't. I really saw how worried she is when iam not pushing. Even though pain is mine she took entire pressure. I trusted her completely to my life. She brought my tiny naturally without using any instrument.We were
 really moved on hearing when she told my family the reason why she did not prefer using instruments. She told if it is a girl and has a scar on her face she will have to deal with it lifetime. I am very lucky that i have changed my opinion in the nth moment. I never saw such a dedicated doctor. She is the miracle which happend to me.

Today iam very healthy and could look after my tiny without any assistance.

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Before I write anything, let me tell you that we had a baby boy delivered 1 month 10 days before the expected delivery date. In medical terms, they call it a pre term delivery or pre mature baby.  Of course. no magic happened and my baby had respiratory problems and was kept in NICU for two days. He recovered completely and is doing great now. I hate to use the term "" pre mature"" as he is very active and healthy.

Now I would like you to know, that my wife had a normal delivery and I had an extremely amazing experience at Ovum hospital with Dr. Sapna Lulla. 
We started following up with Dr. Sapna starting from the day 1 after the positive pregnancy test. The pregnancy period was not so easy for us. She had a blod clot which was detected in 2nd month of pregnancy. Dr. Sapna took excellent care of my wife, she put her on progestrone and advised to take bed rest. Fortunately, my wife recovered and the baby was completely fine.

Later on, while the 7th month was about to end, due to shortened cervix, we got to know that there was a risk of early delivery. Dr. Sapna advised my wife to just take rest and not stress. While, during this phase, we were just counting and passing days.
Finally on 11th evening, when we met Dr. Sapna, she diagnosed and asked my wife to get admitted for observation. We were little reluctant as my wife was doing completely fine at this time. However, we completed the formalities of admission and at 9 pm, I went out to grab some food for us. Suddenly, I got a call from my wife that she is having a lot of pain and asked me to return immediately. I reached hospital within 5 minutes, met Dr. Sapna and our baby was delivered at 11 pm.

Dr. Sapna, stressed me that she is going to carry out a normal delivery. I was little concerned but I trusted her. She explained me about each and every circumstances and told me not to worry as everything would  be fine. Eventually, every thing was fine. 
I would like to appreciate Dr. Sapna and thank her from the bottom of my heart for whatever she did to keep the baby and Mom healthy. At each point in time, she kept us well informed. Her stress on normal delivery, even for a pre term, went so well. She is a kind of doctor, who never bothered about of how much money she or the hospital  is going to make, rather took care of my wife's and baby's health.

Moreover, the facilities at OVUM were excellent, especially the NICU. I would strongly recommend and advise to consult her during pregnancy.

Thank you Ovum and Dr. Sapna(You are awesome).

None,"Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"We, my wife (Keerthi P) and I, were introduced to Dr. Sapna Lulla, by my brother-in-law, Dr. Rajeev Pullagura, who was then a surgeon at Specialist Hospital. 
This was my wife's second pregnancy. I would not say that her pregnancies are complicated, but there were hiccups for sure. This time, our entire consultation was with Dr. Sapna. 
She is a very patient person, reads your entire history and always tries to suggest natural remedial measures than putting you on high end medicines. 
My wife had a fall during her 4th month and she had a spot of retro placental bleed, add to it, the baby's weight was less to start with. With suggestions from Dr. Sapna we did sail through this phase smoothly. 
My first child was a normal delivery and hoped the same for the second one as well. However, this time around, we had a couple of things in the last trimester, which concerned the doctor if a normal delivery was indeed possible this time. Also, at 33 weeks, the baby was in breech position. 
With the baby's head circumference being large, it added to the worry if she would deliver normal. 
However, Dr. Sapna motivated us a lot towards the last few weeks so that we could have a normal birth this time. Based on her suggestions, which we trusted the most, labour was induced during 38 weeks 4 days. 
During the labour the baby's heart beat was hitting a high and the baby was mobile. Even though my wife gave up during the labour and told the doctor to do a c-section, Dr. stood steady,  supported & motivated her to go for normal delivery. Personally, we have never seen doctor's being so involved in labour. With Dr. Sapna, my experience was very different, she was there for every second of 3-4 hours of labour, monitoring the baby's heartbeat. With the support of Dr. Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy weighing 3.8 kgs by normal delivery procedure. I will always be obliged to Dr. Sapna, for this. Now a days, where c-section has become a norm, Dr. Sapna and her team had put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Dr. is also very friendly, peppy, positive and full of energy as a person. She is my elder daughter's best friend. Dr. Sapna, will remain the gynecologist we go to for this life, she is the one who has proved to us tht doctor's are next to God.

As we planned our second baby in Bangalore, I was a bit cautious while choosing Gynecologist. I got very good feedback about Doctor Sapna from two of my very close friends who were treated by Sapna Ma’am during their pregnancies in 2016. I found equally good reviews on internet as well. So I decided to go with Dr Sapna for my pregnancy treatment. During my initial few consultation appointments with her; I realized that my decision to go with her was correct.
 
I found Sapna Ma’am very friendly and extremely caring. She’s a seasoned medical practitioner who’s having full confidence on her way of treatment. She knows what’s best for her patients in a given situation. Rather she’s so friendly that she’ll never let you feel that you’re a patient. She’s very flexible and will not prescribe diagnostic tests and medicines un-necessarily and will always encourage you to live your normal life as much as possible rather than taking too many precautions. She’s always approachable and ready to give you right advice even during late night or early morning.

My delivery experience was also equally calm and relaxed. My first baby was born at Gurgaon - my native place and I was extremely tensed and nervous by that experience which was not so good. 
Sapna Ma’am not only gave me enough confidence by assuring me and my child would 100% safe, but also made me feel at ease during the whole process. As she promised, I was totally relaxed & was smiling while entering the operation theatre and came out smiling after giving birth to a healthy baby girl. 
Sapna Ma'am was so caring & concerned that during my stay at hospital, she made sure that she’ll make a visit to all her patients once she’s done with her daily job even if it’s mid-night.

My sincere Thanks to Sapna Ma’am. *** ** *** **** ****** **** **** *** ** ** ****** I would strongly recommend to all my friends and relatives for any OBG related consultation.",2017-10-29 21:08:38,False,True,Jyoti,,,

She always has a smile on her face no matter the time of the day.She always has a positive attitude and motivates us to be the same.She is wonderful and encouraging and always puts us at ease.She ALWAYS stresses on normal delivery.
In the 32nd week,we came to know that our baby was in the breech position.But she never tried to scare us.She said not to worry as most of the times the baby comes back to normal position in the last few weeks.She said not to stress and only suggested some light exercises.My wife felt very safe in her hands.And as predicted by her, the baby had come back to normal position during delivery.
But during delivery there was another complication.My wife  got admitted at midnight and everything went smoothly at first.But after an hour,my wife started experiencing a lot of pain.Reason was the cord wrapped tightly around my baby's leg thus delaying the delivery.Dr.Sapna correctly guessed this was the case ( as it was midnite there was no way to take an ultrasound).She tried very hard to deliver normally.If it was some other doctor ,they would have surely carried out a C section.Though my wife gave up due to excruciating pain,Dr.Sapna never lost faith.She was continuously encouraging my wife and it was through her efforts that my wife delivered a baby boy normally.It was Dr.Sapna's constant  soothing words of encouragement which gave my wife courage in the delivery room.

I delivered my baby boy on Feb 25th 
As per our dream to deliver normal and which is never possible without this wonder women. She made a sensitive girl like me to do it. I never thought i can do it. I had to deliver my boy in 37th week as i had blood spotting and was asked to come to hospital immediately. There onwards she asked me to do all the excercises for the normal delivary. Actually on the same day of my delivery she need to fly to deliver one of her relatives. But she never rushed or handed me over to any other doctor. She is very patient and never left me unattended.  She kept monitoring every now and then. At the nth moment as i couldnt push, she helped me to push. I know i irritated her a lot as all i could hear in my hear is "" push navya push"" but i couldn't. I really saw how worried she is when iam not pushing. Even though pain is mine she took entire pressure. I trusted her completely to my life. She brought my tiny naturally without using any instrument.We were
 really moved on hearing when she told my family the reason why she did not prefer using instruments. She told if it is a girl and has a scar on her face she will have to deal with it lifetime. I am very lucky that i have changed my opinion in the nth moment. I never saw such a dedicated doctor. She is the miracle which happend to me.

Today iam very healthy and could look after my tiny without any assistance.

Thank you Dr.Sapna. I love u and owe you. ",2018-03-02 06:53:10,False,True,Navya vemaraju,,,
None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Before I write anything, let me tell you that we had a baby boy delivered 1 month 10 days before the expected delivery date. In medical terms, they call it a pre term delivery or pre mature baby.  Of course. no magic happened and my baby had respiratory problems and was kept in NICU for two days. He recovered completely and is doing great now. I hate to use the term "" pre mature"" as he is very active and healthy.

Now I would like you to know, that my wife had a normal delivery and I had an extremely amazing experience at Ovum hospital with Dr. Sapna Lulla. 
We started following up with Dr. Sapna starting from the day 1 after the positive pregnancy test. The pregnancy period was not so easy for us. She had a blod clot which was detected in 2nd month of pregnancy. Dr. Sapna took excellent care of my wife, she put her on progestrone and advised to take bed rest. Fortunately, my wife recovered and the baby was completely fine.

Later on, while the 7th month was about to end, due to shortened cervix, we got to know that there was a risk of early delivery. Dr. Sapna advised my wife to just take rest and not stress. While, during this phase, we were just counting and passing days.
Finally on 11th evening, when we met Dr. Sapna, she diagnosed and asked my wife to get admitted for observation. We were little reluctant as my wife was doing completely fine at this time. However, we completed the formalities of admission and at 9 pm, I went out to grab some food for us. Suddenly, I got a call from my wife that she is having a lot of pain and asked me to return immediately. I reached hospital within 5 minutes, met Dr. Sapna and our baby was delivered at 11 pm.

Dr. Sapna, stressed me that she is going to carry out a normal delivery. I was little concerned but I trusted her. She explained me about each and every circumstances and told me not to worry as everything would  be fine. Eventually, every thing was fine. 
I would like to appreciate Dr. Sapna and thank her from the bottom of my heart for whatever she did to keep the baby and Mom healthy. At each point in time, she kept us well informed. Her stress on normal delivery, even for a pre term, went so well. She is a kind of doctor, who never bothered about of how much money she or the hospital  is going to make, rather took care of my wife's and baby's health.

Moreover, the facilities at OVUM were excellent, especially the NICU. I would strongly recommend and advise to consult her during pregnancy.

Thank you Ovum and Dr. Sapna(You are awesome).

None,"Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"We, my wife (Keerthi P) and I, were introduced to Dr. Sapna Lulla, by my brother-in-law, Dr. Rajeev Pullagura, who was then a surgeon at Specialist Hospital. 
This was my wife's second pregnancy. I would not say that her pregnancies are complicated, but there were hiccups for sure. This time, our entire consultation was with Dr. Sapna. 
She is a very patient person, reads your entire history and always tries to suggest natural remedial measures than putting you on high end medicines. 
My wife had a fall during her 4th month and she had a spot of retro placental bleed, add to it, the baby's weight was less to start with. With suggestions from Dr. Sapna we did sail through this phase smoothly. 
My first child was a normal delivery and hoped the same for the second one as well. However, this time around, we had a couple of things in the last trimester, which concerned the doctor if a normal delivery was indeed possible this time. Also, at 33 weeks, the baby was in breech position. 
With the baby's head circumference being large, it added to the worry if she would deliver normal. 
However, Dr. Sapna motivated us a lot towards the last few weeks so that we could have a normal birth this time. Based on her suggestions, which we trusted the most, labour was induced during 38 weeks 4 days. 
During the labour the baby's heart beat was hitting a high and the baby was mobile. Even though my wife gave up during the labour and told the doctor to do a c-section, Dr. stood steady,  supported & motivated her to go for normal delivery. Personally, we have never seen doctor's being so involved in labour. With Dr. Sapna, my experience was very different, she was there for every second of 3-4 hours of labour, monitoring the baby's heartbeat. With the support of Dr. Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy weighing 3.8 kgs by normal delivery procedure. I will always be obliged to Dr. Sapna, for this. Now a days, where c-section has become a norm, Dr. Sapna and her team had put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Dr. is also very friendly, peppy, positive and full of energy as a person. She is my elder daughter's best friend.

As we planned our second baby in Bangalore, I was a bit cautious while choosing Gynecologist. I got very good feedback about Doctor Sapna from two of my very close friends who were treated by Sapna Ma’am during their pregnancies in 2016. I found equally good reviews on internet as well. So I decided to go with Dr Sapna for my pregnancy treatment. During my initial few consultation appointments with her; I realized that my decision to go with her was correct.
 
I found Sapna Ma’am very friendly and extremely caring. She’s a seasoned medical practitioner who’s having full confidence on her way of treatment. She knows what’s best for her patients in a given situation. Rather she’s so friendly that she’ll never let you feel that you’re a patient. She’s very flexible and will not prescribe diagnostic tests and medicines un-necessarily and will always encourage you to live your normal life as much as possible rather than taking too many precautions. She’s always approachable and ready to give you right advice even during late night or early morning.

My delivery experience was also equally calm and relaxed. My first baby was born at Gurgaon - my native place and I was extremely tensed and nervous by that experience which was not so good. 
Sapna Ma’am not only gave me enough confidence by assuring me and my child would 100% safe, but also made me feel at ease during the whole process. As she promised, I was totally relaxed & was smiling while entering the operation theatre and came out smiling after giving birth to a healthy baby girl. 
Sapna Ma'am was so caring & concerned that during my stay at hospital, she made sure that she’ll make a visit to all her patients once she’s done with her daily job even if it’s mid-night.

My sincere Thanks to Sapna Ma’am. *** ** *** **** ****** **** **** *** ** ** ****** I would strongly recommend to all my friends and relatives for any OBG related consultation.",2017-10-29 21:08:38,False,True,Jyoti,,,

She always has a smile on her face no matter the time of the day.She always has a positive attitude and motivates us to be the same.She is wonderful and encouraging and always puts us at ease.She ALWAYS stresses on normal delivery.
In the 32nd week,we came to know that our baby was in the breech position.But she never tried to scare us.She said not to worry as most of the times the baby comes back to normal position in the last few weeks.She said not to stress and only suggested some light exercises.My wife felt very safe in her hands.And as predicted by her, the baby had come back to normal position during delivery.
But during delivery there was another complication.My wife  got admitted at midnight and everything went smoothly at first.But after an hour,my wife started experiencing a lot of pain.Reason was the cord wrapped tightly around my baby's leg thus delaying the delivery.Dr.Sapna correctly guessed this was the case ( as it was midnite there was no way to take an ultrasound).She tried very hard to deliver normally.If it was some other doctor ,they would have surely carried out a C section.Though my wife gave up due to excruciating pain,Dr.Sapna never lost faith.She was continuously encouraging my wife and it was through her efforts that my wife delivered a baby boy normally.It was Dr.Sapna's constant  soothing words of encouragement which gave my wife courage in the delivery room.
Thank you so much Dr.Sapna for being with us like an angel during our difficult journey.May Allah bless you always.

Since it was a second & twin pregnancy, after detailed search on google, we finalized to consult  Dr.Sapna Lulla. Since  Sept 2017 to DEC 2017 we consulted her at regular required visits. During initial pregnancy 10 yrs back, I had  issues with Urinary infections during 7-8 month pregnancy period. With that experience, during every  visit to doctor in 2017, we ensured to take a urinary test report voluntarily to know the status of infection & doctor recommended necessary prescription based on the Urinary Test report status. So a pro-active check was kept in this regard continuously from Sep 2017 to DEC 2017. With doctor support, guidance, necessary scanning & prescription, we managed to pull around till 34+6 weeks. Since TWIN A Was in Breech Presentation;TWIN B Was in Cephalic presentation, during this last phase, mode of delivery had to be LSCS only.
Since the average twins delivery period range is 35-37 weeks and in order to avoid more complications during this phase,  we decided to bring out the twin kids on 01.01.18 at around 2pm. As planned  two twin boys were born on 01.01.18 at around 2.56 pm & 2.57 pm respectively.
Both had to be kept at NICU due to prematurity ( 34+6weeks).
Twin-1 & Twin-2 were at NICU for 9 days & 18 days respectively due to Respiratory Distress; Sepsis; Viral Infection; Jaundice & other minor issues.
We were updated on daily basis on the status, progress made on daily basis during this tenure at Hospital. 
We are very happy on the new born kids recovery, the treatment that the kids received at NICU during the stay  & returning back to home in good health.

Dr.Sapna was reviewed my case very carefully and explained us how to proceed for further. Initially she has started giving the treatment for the PCOS. But due to my ectopic surgery, I did have lot of difficulties and the chances were very less to get conceive soon. But with continuous help of Sapna maam and the suggestions she had given make us more confident and comfortable which lead to us a successful twin pregnancy.  
But still I was not happy due to one more other problem which concerned me a lot i.e. carrying twin babies. As I had Cornual ectopic surgery & considered my uterus health condition carrying twin babies will put me on more risk and chances are there to puncture the existing stitches again. The thought it self scared me a lot and made me many sleepless nights. Again Sapna maam took responsibility on this issue and supported us for every moment/difficulties we had and make us feel free throughout the pregnancy term until delivery. Now I am also one of the happiest mothers with two baby girls. 
All this happened because of Dr.Sapna and We really thankful to her for the entire support she has given for us. We do highly recommended her to others for hassle free pregnancy/delivery OR if you have any difficulties to get Conceive.

This is the first time I am taking my time to write a review on a doctor *** ******* ** **** ** **** **** * **** ******** *********. 

I consulted Dr. Sapna Lulla at Ovum hospital when I was 4 weeks pregnant to ensure that my pregnancy is safe and healthy. She recommended me to take up a blood test to understand my ‘Beta HCG’ count and a ‘scanning’ to ensure that the gestational sac is visible at the right location.

When the reports came in - the pregnancy was confirmed but was an unhealthy one, which they medically call it as ‘CERVICAL PREGNANCY’ the term which I heard for the first time in my life. To further worsen the situation, mine was a high risk cervical pregnancy where the gestational sac was at the external orifice (OS) of the uterus. The only option available for me was to terminate the pregnancy which was not at all an easy task because of the complications involved. This is where the experienced hand saved my life.

Dr. Sapna explained to me the importance of the entire case with great patience and clarity. How she is planning to go ahead with my pregnancy termination process and detailed me about the multiple methods. The best part in her is that she always tries to get the job done with minimal pain and lower risks. The entire process went for a week, but was admitted only for 2 days at hospital – first day she successfully removed the ‘sac’ and the second day I was under observation***** ** *** ***** ** *********** *** **** *** ***** *** * ***** ***** ****** She always maintains a pleasant smile on her face not matter whether it is her start or end of the day.

She is very practical minded *** ********** **** *** ******** **** ** ** ********** This attitude of her really helped me to be at ease and lighter my problems.

From my first visit doctor was very patient and was explaining all the complications of a diabetic mother and how to overcome it.. during my entire pregnancy time I am under the watch of doctor for my sugar level. She used to answer my call even at the odd times if my sugar level is getting incerased.

The happiest part which none of the diabetic mother can have is, I delivered Full Term Baby with Normal delivery at my 39th week.

My cervix was not dilated and the doctor decided to induce labour for me. She asked me to get admitted in the hospital on Thursday and have first shot of gel to induce the labour. cervix got dilated to 2 cm and again they gave me the next shot of gel at Friday early morning and doctor advised to go for walk so that the cervix will get dilated soon. Around 1Pm I got dilated to 4 cm and took me to labour room.

Soon the dilation got more .During the labour pain all the nursing staffs were there to help me and to encourage me for baring the pain which really helped me a lot.they allowed my husband also to be with me during the labour pain which gave me the support to bare the pain.

I delivered a beautiful baby girl at around 4PM and baby was healthy. This is like a magic which was done by doctor where we all think that normal delivery is not possible for diabetic mother. She proved that it can be possible. my entire family is very thankful to the doctor for the care and support she gave to us.

Dr. Sapana explained us the process of induced labour and timeframe for the baby progress after inducing for normal delivery. She induced the labour in the afternoon on the day we got admitted.

Even after deciding and agreeing to go for C-section, Dr. Sapna and her team had put in all the efforts to tried a lot, even waited in the labour room till 2:00am for a normal birth, before going for C-section. Finally with the support of Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy.

The Hospital staff at Motherhood HRBR layout were very friendly, positive and it felt like our home. The hospital sisters were very friendly and were very to next us and took care of the mother and baby every single minute of the staty. The whole experience at the hospital was like a family get together.
 
Thank you Dr. Sapna and the Motherhood Hospital for all your support and care.

Lulla in motherhood hospital ,HRBR .Would like to share my experience so that other ladies suffering like me can benefit from Dr Sapna Just like I did.


 couple of days back I had severe abdominal pain and  heavy bleeding and I was heading towards a very critical stage.
After checking the reviews in google about Dr.Sapna I reached out to her on an emergency.I was very scared of gynaecologists as my past experience with some of the Docs were not great.To my surprise Dr Sapna greeted me with a nice smile and also heard me out patiently.She is an amazing Dr I have ever met.Without making me Panicky she explained the seriousness of my case and also the complexity involved while giving me the confidence of recovery.I was completely convinced with Dr Sapna and underwent the surgery couple of days back.

Mine was a very complex case of multiple fibroids with bigger ones measauring upto 7.3 CMs and my uterus was enlarged because of that.I got it successfully opearated by Dr Sapna .She took  good care of me post my surgery as well and i am doing fine now.

Many times when we are in deep pain and suffering is when we start praying God and god also responds to our prayers .In my case ,I see Dr Sapna as a god sent gift to me and I see her as my saviour .My heartfelt thanks to the Dr..Honestly no words to thank her.May god bless her and her family.

I would strongly recommend Dr Sapna for any type of abdominal surgeries Including complex surgeries based on my experience.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy experience with the Dr Sapna Lulla is Amazing, few things i've to mention here why she is so Special -

She brainwashed us on delaying/postponing parenthood and having kids later is the biggest mistake in life.

Since the time I got concieved, she took care of me & my baby like a mother. As a first time mother, I & My Dear Husband had many doubts and fears which were clarified with lots of patience and promised all the times with a smile ""Trust me, I'll take care of everything"".

She always says and believes ""Pregnancy is not a disease, It's a sweet journey / a moment to remember in life and Enjoy every moment of it"". In the entire 38 weeks of my pregnancy, I was not at all on any strict diet. After 3 months of my pregnancy she even allowed us to out-station travel by road / rail transport. Not suggested any special pregnancy exercises like other doctors does, asked me to do the household work & 30 mins walk daily. That's why I never felt I am going through pregnancy disease.

She did not ask for unnecessary tests and medicens, suggested only required things to prepare for normal pregnancy.

At 36 weeks my baby weight was almost 3.090kg, still I remember what she said after seeing the reports ""If you feel the  baby weight is a concern and if you're worrying whether normal vaginal delivery happens or not if we wait for few more weeks. If you ask me to do immediate delivery for that, I strictly won't do that until 38 weeks if mother & baby both are doing well. If you are looking for such kind of options, better consult some other doctors"".

She scolds when needed if there is no co-operation from Mother/Family, but that's all for good reasons :).

She is reachable all the time and will answer all the queries over the phone / WhatsApp.

The D-Day experience(Will be remembering for a lifetime) - It's on Sunday evening when I started feeling labor symptoms, I called Dr Sapna immediately and told all the symptoms. She immediately responded even though she is on off duty, and asked us to go to hospital immediately and I'll try to ASAP. She informed to her team clearly what to do before Dr arrives to the hospital. Her team took care of me very nicely, told nothing to worry. When Doctor reached hospital, she said we will wait for another 12hrs to increase naturally the intensity of labor pains. She even visited in-between (around 2am) to check the condition of mine. Finally they shifted me to labor room around 7:45am, after 2 1/2 hrs I delivered a healthy baby boy through normal vaginal delivery. And my baby birth weight was 3.500kg, many of my colleagues didn't believed when I said delivered a baby of 3.5kg weight through normal delivery. And specially I have to mention Dr Swetha who took care of me very well in the labor room, allowed my Dear Husband to stay with  me in the labor when I am in tense.   

Thank you Dr Sapna for everything, you brought colors into my life. I wish more and more doctors walk in Dr Sapna's path where a mother can leave all fears about normal delivery because there is nothing greater than natural birth.

She told take Dailycal and orfer xt tablet for calcium, folic acid and iron supplements for entire duration. In 32th week scan she told there is low level of fluid and given supplement sachet for increasing fluid. Once again scan is done on 37th week but fluid level is low further.

Dr.Sapna inspires confidence in you through out pregnancy, even in the most critical condition she will assure you that things would be fine.. You just  need to follow her advice and medications..!!

A very patient-centric Doctor, who cares to listen to all of the patient's concerns and who provides the necessary details and management options which are beneficially directed towards both the Mother as well as the Baby. 

She would never force you with any decision but will always guide you with a detailed explanation which helps a lot in taking meaningful decisions...!!

We stay in HBR layout and we opted Ovum hospitals with little bit of hesitation since it is being new in Kalyana Nagar area. With first consultation with Dr. Sapna, we were at ease. 

Dr. Sapna is quite experienced and clear headed doctor. I guess she is one of the busiest doctor in Ovum. She interacts with patients lively and makes us feel comfortable. She patiently answers our questions. She is very courteous too. She is quite risk avert. She will ask you to go thought most of the standard tests to make sure to know health of the baby and mother at every step.

When we were into the 7th month of pregnancy, she gave her personal contact number so that we can directly contact her in case of any emergencies. Let me tell you that she answers our calls at odd hours as she promised. On the day of the delivery also she came down to hospital at midnight (1AM) and stayed till the time of delivery at 8:30AM. She is mostly in favor of normal delivery. During those 7 and half hours of critical, anxious and fearful wait, she kept us updating on the condition of the patient as and when required. She listens to our opinions too during those hours! It helped us to finally have safe normal delivery.

Overall we are highly appreciative of Dr. Sapna Lulla’ s efforts in making our family complete with that smooth delivery of new baby. We wish her all the best for her career ahead at Ovum hospitals.

I had been visiting her since 2014 for my wife and taking treatments under her.
This time it was for my Mother who was told by another doctor for uterus removal. That is when we decided to take second opinion from Doctor Sapna regarding this.
To start off she was perfect in assessing the problem  for which we had approached her. She checked all the reports and told us we need to do few more test to come to a conclusive result that what kind of surgery needs to be performed and the current state of the problem to be assessed.
After all this most importantly she explained what procedure would be done, the recovery time line and tips to overcome the problems which can be expected during this surgery.
Now after the surgery we feel very confident that we approached the right Doctor to get this surgery done. DR.Sapna is very calm, approachable, patient enough to listen to us and most importantly very smiling which relives from the pain gone or going through while talking to her.
Post-surgery she did explain what was done in the OT and explained how the whole procedure was performed in simple terms which was helpful for us to understand.
A doctor who doesn't see the timings and receives call at any point of time for her patients & representatives for any questions which marks her amazing quality and dedication to whatever she does. She explains in detail what is the best thing in a situation we are & what can be done and needs to be done which brings confidence on the spot.
Overall it was brilliant experience and would definitely recommend DR Sapna to Family and Friends and also to people who are reading this review and hope this will help you whenever you are looking for a doctor for any similar cases as she has vast knowledge and conducts detailed research before arriving to conclusions.

We started visiting Dr. Sapna in another hospital but we moved to Motherhood with her. She is very patient and supportive. She answered all my questions with lot of patience and spent decent amount of time with each patient. 

During my labor too, she was very helpful and encouraging. Mine was a very fast progressing labor, I guess. She kept all the staff on toes and made them assist me as fast as they can. 

Though Motherhood Kalyan Nagar is a new branch and had some initial start-up infrastructure issues, she made sure that everything is on place for safe deliveries, normal or c- section. 

The best part is, Dr. Sapna always tries to encourage normal delivery by making us work (physically), though some feel it's very tiring during pregnancy. She made me walk, take stairs, squats and encouraged me to do all household work, ultimately I ended up with a safe and quick normal delivery.

I was going through many hardships during my early pregnancy. Dr. Sapna treated me and gave me confidence to come out of the difficult situation at many instances.

Even though, my first baby was through C Section, she was still trying till end for the normal delivery as there was enough gap between my first and second baby. However, we had to take a call for C section as contractions were not developed and baby was nearing full term.  There were some unexpected complications experienced during my C section and she handled it very well and also highlighted the need of taking special care of the baby to the Pediatrician/ NICU. 

Post-delivery, she continued to provide good advises to overcome the pain and other problems, I was going through. In fact, at difficult times, she had provided advice/treatment over Whatsapp in odd hours.

She is a very humble person and treats her patients with respect and  becomes your partner in your journey of Motherhood. She is very passionate and professional about her job. Overall, a great experience and association with her.

The process of conception being a struggle these days, the very basic thing that any patient longs for, is for her to have a stress free relationship with her doctor during consultations and procedures. You have never failed us in this aspect. Your way of handling your patients to keep them in a comfort zone by patiently explaining the procedures, clearing doubts and addressing fears at each and every step and being available for any urgency gives a personal touch - just what we need. With Dr. Sapna, even painful procedures can be undergone in an almost painless way. 

We are half way through our journey to becoming parents. Thank you so much Dr. Sapna, we are so happy to be associated with you in this journey and look forward to experiencing one of the best moments in our life with you in the coming months. 

Thanks loads,

We would like to thank Dr. Sapna Lulla, We met her at when my wife was at 7th month. At our very first visit doctor said, “Now it’s not only your baby, as you choose me as your doctor, along with you both, now it’s my baby also. We all three will take this journey towards normal delivery with a healthy baby” and that made us feel we have made a right choice and decision on changing the doctor in between. And she also gave us lots of emotional support during treatment process. Doctor guidance and patience to wait for pain to start normally and early intervention helped us in having a normal delivery with a healthy baby as she said. 

People need to have patience when they visiting doctors, sometimes we may have to wait little long hours, sometime appointment may get cancelled due to emergency cases. Most of the time doctors work continuous shift.

After all the research, reviews and opinions, we decided that the right doctor will help us go a long way through. That was when we heard of Dr. Sapna Lulla. I’m generally a person who doesn’t believe in people casting opinions on social media on gynec consultation and delivery. After talking to many patients and doctors, we banked on Dr. Sapna! I would say for any doctor /patient - the trust factor is very crucial. This was mutual in this case! Like all would-be-parents desire, we too wanted a normal delivery instead of cesarean. And that was a long shot though! 
Dr. Sapna’s calmness and experience played a pivotal role. The patience-level and the rapport built over a period of time was magnificent. Her skill of assessing the patient’s body condition and the art of following a particular process impressed us a great deal. 
Her service and experience at the time of delivery made us feel on top! Thanks to Dr. Sapna for keeping up her promise of a normal delivery and we are happy parents now! 
I would certainly recommend Dr. Sapna Lulla to anyone who’s wanting to consult for gynec consultation, pregnancy and delivery.

The journey between April’2017 to January’2018 has been a truly memorable one and thanks to Dr. Sapna who has made it possible. Her timely advise and “Pep-Talks” has not just made my wife be physically fit during her pregnancy period but she supported her to be prepared even more psychologically. Despite of having a fibroid, the doctor was always confident about a normal delivery. All her efforts did lead to a “Normal Deliver” (yes, you read it right) of a beautiful princess on 16.01.2018. She is a person of high integrity who has always kept the convenience of her patient on priority even more than her own.

Me and my wife owe a lot for the services provided by Dr Sapna Lulla. I will explain our experience in the following lines for the benefit of expecting parents. 
My wife started experiencing preterm labour at 30 weeks. My wife was admitted for 2 days and the Doctor was successful in stopping the preterm delivery. My wife was under medication (including complete bed rest) advised by Dr Sapna Lulla. Later at 36 weeks 5 days my wife delivered a healthy baby boy at Motherhood Hospital HRBR layout. On top of all, the delivery was a normal one  even though our previous child is born through C-Section delivery.  Doctor reached the hospital in very short notice even at 3:15 am. I could see from the window of hospital waiting area that Doctor was rushing out of her car and running to the delivery room. We appreciate the ""patient first"" approach of the doctor. 
We appreciate the duty doctors/supporting/nursing staff of the hospital for their support and friendly care.

None,"Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"This is when we were expecting our second child. I was referred to Dr Sapna Lulla by my doctor as she was retiring. It was 3 months to go before my delivery and I was very apprehensive in changing my doctor at such an advanced stage of the pregnancy. 

I still remember my first visit to Dr Sapna coz I was talking about it with my husband for a long time. She patiently went through the notes of my previous doctor to understand the issues I had faced and the care I had been provided. She called my earlier doctor to discuss my case and in a way seek permission to take my case forward. She did a thorough check up on me to understand my current situation.

Ever since that day, right through the remainder of the pregnancy, during and post the delivery Dr Sapna has been there right through, the care she displayed was very comforting for me. I delivered 4 weeks before my due date and had to call her in emergency. She was at the hospital within a very short period of time to initiate the C-section.

In addition to Dr Sapna, the staff at Ovum Hospital were very caring and good. A much better experience than what I had at the hospital where I went for my first babys delivery. 

Dr Sapna is a very caring and professional doctor.  I have recommended her to quite a few of my friends who are expecting and would continue to do so in future as well.

Thank You Doctor.

The team OVUM is really amazing.
I met Dr Sapna through one of my colleague and decide to consult her only for my wife pregnancy-to-delivery journey. The Dr Sapna is really a very well experienced doctor and also very cool and calm. The amount of patience and listening to the patient for every (silly) cause is very high & clarifies the same without any hesitation. Hats off to her patience levels. 

The way she look at the patience concerns is really different unlike others. 
She tries to treat her patience with minimum medication and maximum care. She never let go her smiley what ever is the situation and time. That's the beauty of the doctor.

She will ask to go thought most of the standard tests to know the health of the baby and mother at every step. Her cool interaction makes every patient relax & Comfortable. When the months passes and closing to the 34th week, she gave her number to reach her any time (24 hrs) without any hesitation which gives you so much confidence. 

All you need to do is follow her instruction in a timely manner. That's it. At 38th week we met doctor as a routine check up. She found out water breakage and she took a decision & asked to admit in hospital. That day She was in the hospital till 12:30 AM in midnight and monitored and again called up duty Doctor and checked the same at 4 AM early in the morning. Nothing improved so she decided to take C Cut and finally we got a health boy. She discharged in just 2 days of time.  Both baby and mother doing well. Once again Thanks to Dr Sapna.

She explains everything and does not hurry up even though she is a busy doctor. I got to know about her through one of my friends. I visited her during my 7th month and since then she has guided me and supported me in all aspects. She told me that I can deliver normally and suggested me to do all the exercises by visiting a physiotherapist. She also suggested to do all house hold cores as it would help me deliver normally. 

However I ended up in an emergency c section after 10 to 12 hours of labour as my baby's heartbeat started reducing. But the doctor was trying all ways possible till then for a normal delivery and even suggested epidural as I was not able to bear the pain towards the end and I had dilated only about 3 to 4 cm. I though kind of feel that she was not informed about my labour status properly by the hospital staff . But anyways I guess it was God's decision to make me deliver via c section as Dr.Sapna told me that the umbilical cord was very short and a normal delivery would have complicated things even more.

I would like to thank her for all the effort she took. Would highly recommend her 👍.

She managed to push the delivery date by two weeks more than the usual thereby helping babies gain weight. Our babies were delivered safely and are doing fine.Would like to reiterate what many others have said earlier - Dr Sapna Ma’am is gem of a doctor, a through professional with a assuring smile and genuine care for patients.Would like to highlight two things that, we believe, deserve special mention. First, high standards that she has set for her entire team, not only at Sapna Health Care but also at extended hospitals. Second, despite her busy schedule, she is available at any time. In case of emergency, she told us to call her immediately irrespective of the hour and also gave us the back-up mobile numbers. At one point when we were going through a critical phase, she called us late in the evening around 11:30 pm and again next morning around 8:00 am to check the things. This was very reassuring.If you are consulting with Sapna Ma’am, we can say with sincerity and utmost confidence that you are in safe hands.",2020-10-22 20:25:22,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

This was our first pregnancy and everything was new. There were multiple complications we faced from 4th to 6th month and Dr advice has helped gain our baby girl’s weight through this time. We anticipated a premature birth and it happened so by 6.5 weeks early. We as parents to be were obviously worried and Dr did the best to push through to 34th week from 30th even with complications. Our baby is a week old now and yes, she need more care through the first 5-8 weeks, but she is safe.

Dr was available at almost all times when we reached out to her, unless she had any prior appointments. One thing I/we learnt through the pregnancy is, every small thing matter to us and we try to get double checked if all is well with doctor. That’s quite normal and human tendency. At the same time, if Dr is unavailable, we should also understand, there is someone else she is attending to, who need urgent attention.

She tried to push for a normal delivery all through, but, she transparently conveyed when it could possibly endanger the delivery process and we had to chose otherwise.
