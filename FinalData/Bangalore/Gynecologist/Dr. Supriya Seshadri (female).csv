But we had a really bad experience while went to her for growth scan. We found her very rude, she suddenly came & just stopped the previous doctors examination which she was doing in detail. She should have provided little more time & enough explanation on the scan results & a bit of empathy to attend to patients queries. She just wanted to finish the scan as quickly as possible & move to next patients.",2019-08-12 18:51:33,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
