"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I believe, Parent hood is the biggest fortune that can happen in one's life.
With so much of unpleasant surprises in mine & my wife's life, the only way forward we felt was to become parents & move on like any normal family. We had our doubts when we decided to go to a fertility clinic like any of you have. Whether this is right decision, right place, where these clinics are business/money oriented. But it took a positive twist since we met Dr.Arunima. 
Not only that Arunima mam's treatment, diagnosis, prescriptions, suggestions where accurate & more than perfect, the warmth of a caring sister was there since day 1 and till date. Glad to say that, now we are expecting and all thanks goes to Arunima Mam. Like any of us face, there will be many panic situations & doubts during this phase & mam stood strong with us to resolve it even during odd hours(Remember, she is the mother of a new born baby). She is a doctor that we can trust 100% and she never suggests any medicine that is not necessary. During lock down situations, where mobility & transportation was risky, she even extended support beyond the expectation to make it so smooth. Even after conceiving & proceeding with the maternity phase, mam makes a point that she calls/pings and ensure that we are on a non-risk path which hardly I have seen in any doctors in my life.

You can trust my words as not a marketing content but true facts to the fullest. Mam is family to us.",2020-11-20 08:36:02,False,True,Ajay,Thank you Ajay for these beautiful words. Humbled. ,2020-11-20T10:18:07+0000,Dr. Arunima Halder
