She is so down to earth and always setting a very positive tone for every patient. God was so kind that they paved the way to Vinutha Mam . It was our second delivery and we moved from Pune to Bangalore on 5th month of our pregnancy .. on our initial reports done in Pune , there were many complications like blood flow was less to baby , amnoitic fluid was less and many more ..with many uncertainty about our pregnancy we landed in Bangalore, me and my husband are in search of a good doctor. After seeing the reviews , we took the appointment with Vinutha Mam , infact I would say Destiny made us to meet with Vinutha Mam.From our first visit , she was so patiently listening all our story and assured not to worry at all and suggested to do very few scans. In our second visit , she ensured evrything is fine and not to worry. I can't explain it was so relieving and Blissful.. we were sure we are in safe hands. For any query and advice , she was just a call or message away .She never suggests unnecessary scans or multiple visit to hospital if everything is fine. She will listen all our queries , infact few are silly , and very patiently replies and clarifies all our doubts and suggests the best. It was so smooth till the delivery, Then as due date was near by she informed all pros and cons of both normal and CS as my first baby was born by CS. And one more good thing is: she is so transparent , she gives the best of advices and we knew she knows the best ,and we went for the one which was best for both baby and mother ..finally the day has arrived and we delivered our baby and there were many complications during the cs due to previous surgery and the Vinutha Mam and her experienced  team handled evrything so smoothly and baby was delivered with no risk factors. 

Me and my family are so indebted with her treatment during my pregnancy journey. I highly recommend Vinutha Mam if you are looking for a good doctor for your pregnancy journey. She is so positive , down to earth , transparent and very friendly. During pregnancy , you need a doctor who listens to you patiently and gives the best of advices. She is the one who is like a best friend , a best advisor and best care taker. 

 This was not my pregnancy journey,  i would rather say an emotional journey for me. Due to many pregnancy uncertainty and few past incidents,  I used to get panic attacks in my last trimester. My husband used to call her and believe me guys no matter how busy she is , she always takes up our call and consoles me.

By god's grace and Vinutha mam guidance we have our second child at Cloudnine hospital and its a normal delivery. We have one child of seven years old and also last year I got miscarriage. When I got confirmed about pregnancy from the strip test , I experienced a lot of vomiting and uneasiness and Covid situation was also on the rise,¬†tried visiting the previous consultant Gynecologist¬†but unfortunately she was not practicing in the hospital. Immediately we searched in the internet about best Gaenocologist near me in google and don't want to delay since there was a miscarriage last time. This¬†way we got to know about Dr. Vinutha Mam and read the reviews. It was¬†so impressive and,¬†then at that instance, we decided to give it a try and gave a visit during the 6th week of pregnancy to the Divine clinic even though it is a little far from my residence. During the first visit we were very impressed because she understands her¬†patients very well not¬†only just as a doctor, but also as a friend, like a family member she¬†cares for them,¬†she enquired all our previous pregnancy details and miscarriage etc and clarified each and every doubt we had and then started our journey to have our second child.
During each visit she clarified all the doubts and explained what needed to be done like test/scan/ medicines the best thing in mam is she¬†never asked me to do any unnecessary checkups or blood tests or monthly scans. It¬† is done only when required. In my¬†second trimester mam¬†started with¬†vitamins, calcium and iron tablets and asked us to have healthy food to stay healthy throughout our entire pregnancy journey and¬†doctor advised us to start with walking,¬†yoga sessions from the 5th month of pregnancy.¬†During this period of pregnancy, I went through many ups and downs Healthwise¬†like had covid positive results, facing high sugar levels, and itching during the third trimester.¬†But during this¬†stressful time¬†all I could overcome due to continued follow up and mam's support, and guidance¬†which¬†played a crucial role in helping this situation.
When we were in third trimester enquired about the delivery and hospital to choose, then about whether she would be available during delivery etc.,
We preferred Cloud nine Hospital, as want mam to be their throughout my pregnancy.¬†I was in 39 weeks of pregnancy¬†didn't have pain or water break but¬†was getting white thick discharge so consulted mam.¬†She asked me to get the NST test done from a nearby hospital and send the report immediately. I got the test done and sent the report and everything seems to be fine. Doctor advised me to wait for one more week and get admitted to hospital.¬†But after 2 days i.e 17th of August 2022, I was getting watery discharge and¬†asked me to come down to cloudnine. So I visited at 11 AM on the same day and mam¬†got me admitted and¬†The Duty Dr after consulting Dr Vinutha mam broke my water bag and¬†induced pains¬†and informed me that by night I will be delivered my baby.¬†In the hospital the¬†Doctor and staff monitored me and then pain started gradually increasing very fast¬†and was updated the same to Dr Vinutha mam. As my Labour pain was progressing very fast and By 4 pm I was shifted to the labour ward and¬†at last by god's grace and doctor's advice I delivered a baby girl with normal delivery¬†on 17th of August 2022.at¬†4:39 pm. Words are less to thank you mam¬† 

If you are planning pregnancy. I strongly recommend people to visit Dr Vinutha mam.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Having Dr.Vinutha B as our obstetrician was a blessing. She is genuinely concerned, cares about her patients not to mention strict when it comes to certain things like exercise and diet. We started seeing her from November 27th 2021 when I was 6 weeks pregnant and met her at cloudnine kanakapura hospital. She accessed me and prescribed folic acid for the first three months and then slowly as I stepped into my fifth month she started talking to me about my protein intake, prescibed calcium and iron supplements and also talked to us about the importance of exercise mainly yoga and how that can help me in having an easy and a less painful normal delivery. She is always thinking about minimizing risks and likes to be informed first hand about anything we feel is not normal and keeps tabs on them. She explains to us as to why she would want certain scans or blood tests done. 
As we were approaching the final leg of pregnancy - the ninth month she took a call and did a membrane sweep after looking at our reports. What soon started as slight pains in my lower abdomen and groin later progressed into an agonizing ordeal of pain which she told us to keep an eye on and to wait. Eventually the next day at 3:45 am the labour pains had already kicked in and my water broke and my husband took me to the hospital. Being my first delivery I was scared and in a lot of pain and didn't know what to expect. The hospital prepped me and took me to the labour room where the doctor walked in soon after. She came in all confident and reassuring and eased me into accepting the reality of what was about to happen the next half hour. Every consultation we had with Dr.Vinutha from the seventh month was about this moment and she had been very clear about what to expect during a normal delivery. We had a very organic delivery and no pain was induced. She monitored my baby's heart and on her orders I pushed. She made calculated cuts measuring in on the baby's head and told me to push for the fourth and final time. With all my might and energy I had with me, I pushed and pushed and into my docter's hand came a beautiful baby girl who I can now proudly say weighed 3.5 kgs. My pain and exhaustion did not seem to matter when I got to hold her for the first time. Dr.Vinutha was always with me when I needed her and each mother and baby is precious to her. I recommend only Dr.Vinutha for anyone I come across needs help or guidance. In the end I wouldn't change a single thing that happened to me during my delivery and hope to see Dr.Vinutha again in a few years for the next one. Thank you Dr.Vinutha for everything you've done for usüòò. Loads of love your way‚ù§Ô∏èüòò.

She is very patient person who genuinely cares about her patients. Doctor stays near our place so we started consulting in the Divine women clinic from the very first month. Our journey started from November 15th 2021 when I was 6 weeks pregnant. At the very first visit the doctor made us very comfortable and explained all the pros and cons and started with folic tablets. We decided to have a pregnancy journey with the same doctor throughout even if i stay in my mothers place which was quite far of 25kms from the clinic. Doctor used to guide us on food intake and used to clear all our silly doubts.. We used to question her for around half an hour and she used to answer all those without any hesitation. Doctor will not ask to go for unnecessary checkups or blood tests or monthly scans. She thinks our money is her money and asks us not to spend on unwanted scans. She lets us know only if need arises we will go for the scan else a strict no. Best thing about our doctor is that she doesn't give any tablets other than vitamins, calcium and iron tablets and asks us to have home made food to stay healthy throughout our entire pregnancy journey. She focuses more on normal delivery rather than going up for C - section delivery. This was in my mind as i wanted to go for normal delivery and joined yoga sessions as well upon doctors advice from 5th month of pregnancy.
Best part is I didn't have pain or water break till the 39th week and the doctor advised me to wait for one more week and get admitted to hospital. I got admitted to hospital after completing 40 weeks 2 days. Then doctor met me in cloudnine Kanakpura Road, Bangalore and advised me to go for induced pain. Doctor and staff monitored me for 24 hours and then pain started gradually increasing, actually i was shouting at the top of my voice but even then the doctor didn't lose patience and she made me understand about the situation and at last by god's grace and doctor's advice I delivered a baby boy with normal delivery on 21st of July 2022.

All the ones who are out there looking for a better doctor, my sincere advice is to visit Dr. Vinutha mam. No second thoughts please. We are very happy with the things doctor deal with and make us more comfortable. We all feel the doctors to be like her and she is the best example and I love meeting her as she has become very close to us in this entire journey.. Lots of love from our family...

Words are less to thank Dr. Vinutha and her staff - Radhika as she is no different and will go the length to make sure all is well.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Laparoscopic Sterilization,Stomach Cramps,Salpingectomy,",0,0,YES,"Our story started in Texas, USA. For almost a month, i was having unusual stomach cramp along with sharp back pain. When we consulted our doctor in US, we were diagnosed with an abnormal pregnancy and were on regular HCG count test to track the progress. During this stressful time, we also had travel plans to India which further complicated our situation. During this time, we gave a call to Dr. Vinutha after reading her reviews and the clinics proximity to our house. We were initially worried that traveling from US during covid time, there would be some hesitancy to get an appointment. However, when the doctor spoke to us, she was very calm and understanding. She asked us for the background and made us feel comfortable by reassuring us to come and visit her as soon as we arrive. This made us travel with less worry on our mind.

When we reached Bangalore, we visited an other doctor due to an urgency and had an extremely negative experience. The same day evening we already had a scheduled appointment with Dr Vinutha and went to her with all the history and explained our case. Dr Vinutha spoke to us very nicely and explained to us in detail on the options we had in front of us. We sat almost for 45 minutes and kept asking questions, which she answered to our satisfaction. We continued the care that was needed along with lab tests with her. She expedited our lab tests and called us the next day when the results came in and further explained to us that the option we had chosen to wait was the best based on the outcome of the result. Our next lab test was scheduled in a weeks time. 

After a week, when we visited Dr Vinutha, we asked for an option of surgery since it was more convenient to us based on situations. She again explained to us everything we needed to know and gave thorough inputs on what the surgery would entail. We additionally asked if the surgery can be done somewhere closer since we had another infant to take care of.  Dr Vinutha helped us tremendously by suggesting a few options nearby and finally the surgery was fixed the next morning at 7 am.

The next day, Dr Vinutha arrived early and comforted us saying that things will be fine and the surgery is a minor one. After the surgery, she explained everything that was done (bilateral salpingectomy) and the circumstances leading to it. She came back in the afternoon to check upon us and kept the spirits high. We asked for a favor to have us discharged the same day and after careful consideration she said okay to that as well.

After a week, we visited Dr Vinutha again for the follow up and she removed the stiches and dressed up the wound again. We were checking if we need to visit again, however, she was confident in telling us that things looked fine and we dont have to come back unless there is pain again. She also explained to us to expect everything to get back to normal soon.

As i write this, things are normal and i am able to go back to my life prior to this whole episode. Dr Vinutha's excellent people skills, communication, empathy, willingness to go beyond to help played a crucial role in helping us navigate our situation. We strongly recommend people to visit Dr Vinutha as needed.

Thank you Doctor!

Every thing was so well and I was very confident on my labour as well as she used to tell me and give me confidence but suddenly on my 33rd week 28th of April 2020 my water broke at 3pm my husband called doctor and informed what happened so she asked us to come to hospital immediately, before we reach there everything was already and they knew that I am coming wen i reached there they took me to scanning and confirmed weather baby head is down are not and checked my fluied lavel baby head was down ,water level was also sufficient and they checked and confirmed that its a labour doctor vinutha kept on calling to duty doctors to know the updates and she was guiding them and in few hours doctor vinutha came to me and she tried to push my labor since it was 33week Bby is pre term but my labor pain started and there was no option then labor in the begging 3 cm was dilated and kept on increasing doctor didn't even go home it was late night she was there with me itself around midnight 1am 8cm was dilated then I was shifted to labor room until then I was totally fine no bp variation and even baby heart rate was 152 every thing was perfect but wen I started to push the babys heart rate suddenly dipped and that was the time where doctor didn't even wait for a second I was shifted to the OT and had to go with C Sec but then wen baby came out baby didn't cry baby had to shifted to NICU and I was fine .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Gynaecological Problem,",0,0,YES,"Before I start, I would like to thank Dr.Vinutha Prashanth. Mam you are the reason to bring back the happiness for me & my family‚Ä¶!! Thank you so much‚Ä¶!!  
Our journey with Dr Vinutha Prashanth started at Divine Women & Child Speciality Clinic in the beginning of Year 2021, it was running 7th year of our marriage life, consulted couple of doctors in the past for medication but no luck. One of my friends suggested me to consult Dr Vinutha Prashanth. We had no hopes before going to mam‚Äôs clinic and we thought this is our final try before going to IVF or other higher treatment if it does not work out. Fortunately, we consulted a right person, we are very great full to my friend for introducing Dr. Vinutha Prashanth such a wonderful Gynaecologist near our area and South Bangalore as well. 
In our first visit, we explained to mam with the past treatment reports/details, and she patiently listened, understand the problem and challenges we have. She started investigating the case thoroughly and diagnosed the issues step by step. Wife conceived in couple of months of treatment starts and delivered a healthy baby without any complications throughout. It shows her right way of treatment in a right time & direction to get wife conceived in couple of months which did not happen in past 6 years from other doctors‚Äô treatment. She is very transparent in explaining the issues that may arise at all stages of wife pregnancy and she is not the one who prescribes unnecessary tests, medicines, or supplements, rather she prefers more of exercises and natural foods, also she avoids unnecessary expenditure by eliminating medications or therapies. 
Dr Vinutha Prashant is a wonderful human being who shows utmost concern and care for each patient, many of our doubts she did clarify by WhatsApp chat without fail, it reduces our time & effort in travel, consultation fee is affordable and always she gives value to people not the money, she is very dedicated to her profession, it is very much needed in our society which we saw in her. We have lots of trust and confidence on her which came true, as a name says it is really a Divine World. We are very much happy with the treatment and other services. We honestly recommend Dr. Vinutha Mam if you are planning pregnancy or for routine gynaecological check-up. She is one of the best doctors in Bangalore, the experience is worth. 
Mam, - the compassion with which you treat the patients is more effective than any medicine.! May my baby get a great human heart like you and save the world like you are doing. No words would ever be enough to express our gratitude. Thank you for bringing our angel to earth and the safe delivery... 

We pray God that Dr. Vinutha Prashanth mam to reach greater heights in her life! All the best!! 
Thank you so much for your help and support.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"When i came to know my wife got pregnant i was like on Cloud 9.From practo i j came to know about Dr. Vinutha Prashanth
Then I took a virtual consultation with the Doctor as I was not in Bangalore during that time .From the 1st online consultation I felt like my wife is in safe hands
I truly admire the doctor and the person she is .She congratulated us and prescribed few medicines and asked us to contact her for anything and visit her as soon as we arrive Bangalore

When we reached Bangalore, we visited Dr Vinutha  at Cloudnine Hospital ,Kanakapura. My wife was 28+ weeks pregnant at that time .
We shared all the history that we consulted  in our native place. she went through all the history and did a detailed check of my wife and baby and assured both are absolutely fine

when we asked for scan she said its not required that time  but she does not recommend  for  unnecessary scans and told she will do around 34th weeks .She always insists my wife for Normal delivery and recommended to meditation ,pregnancy exercise .she is always available for the patients .when i say always available its 24/7 just a call or message away

On 9th month of pregnancy my wife felt a little lesser movement of baby. When we informed the Doctor she immediately asked us to do few scans .After that scan report came Dr vinutha called me and informed there is something in CPR values she worried about .Then she informed me  to admit my wife on that day to avoid any unforeseen circumstances

I clearly remember on 18th March she informed me to admit and without any delay we reached cloud nine Kanakpura hospital and did all the admission process

Around 9:30 PM Dr Vinutha came to hospital and met my wife and assured my wife that  everything is alright no need to be worried for anything .There were  few test done like NST during night
During a nonstress test, the baby's heart rate was constantly  monitored to see how it responds to the baby's movements. The duty doctors/nurses used to continuously report the NST results, vitals etc to Dr Vinutha  & she used to watch carefully the reports  and advise accordingly. She kept in constant touch with duty doctors over calls & whatsapp
Around 3 to 3:30 AM at the night the we were informed that there is suspicious result of  NST and need to go for  C-section or caesarean delivery immediately

In midnight a 3:30--:3:45  AM  Dr. Vinutha came to hospital and informed me she will go for emergency caesarean delivery because of suspicious result of  NST

About 4:00 AM Dr went to OT and at 4:15 AM in the early morning my baby angel came into the world .
I was nervous before the surgery but being in great hands of yours has made things much easier. Thank you!
No words would ever be enough to express our gratitude. Thank you for bringing our angel to earth
My baby is very fortunate to have been born through your hands. Thank you for all the support and care, doctor. I will forever remember your wonderful treatment and care for both the baby and my wife . Thank you for your excellent service. May God bless you.

I will never forget the doctor who always smiles and talks with patients very humbly . Your bright aura brings so much joy and inner healing.

I remember that you used to say my wife ..Jaya !!! its normal

No words are enough to appreciate the service you do. You as a doctor and the humble person you are .
The world would be a much better place if all of the doctors were like you. Thank you so much for everything that you have done.

You‚Äôre such a delightful person and a dedicated doctor, you truly are an inspiration! Stay blessed.",2022-04-02 17:06:15,False,True,Debasis Panigrahy,,,

This review might feel very lengthy but I could not make my imotions and feelings more precise than this.

Dr. Vinutha Mam is not just a doctor she is like God for us. We started consulting her in April 2021 for my first pregnency. Entire 9 months of interaction with her always gave positive energy to me. For most of my health complaints she used to say ""Prajakta, it's normal"" these worlds never made me worry about anything during that hard time. Mam never asked me to do any unnecessary Scans or Tests. In 8th month I had preterm labour and was admitted in the hospital. That was very defficult time for me and my husband but mam made sure we get enough medical and emotional support from her. My family wanted us to come to our home town for delivery but I wanted to be in Bangalore just because Vinutha mam is here. After this I was all fine and not called her for almost 3 weeks. She herself called me from her busy schedule to check how I am doing and why I didn't call her. I was almost about to cry to see how much she cares for her patients. 

After 9 months rollers coster ride finally we blessed with baby boy on 1st Feb(full term baby) through Normal delivery. At the time of delivery she was with me in the hospital for almost 7-8 hours and made sure I don't give up and its normal delivery. Mam I am really thankful for this for my lifetime üôè******** ***** *** * ****** *** *** ** when my Mom came to Bangalore I took her to Mam for gynaecologist checkup in which Mam identified her life threatening illness and guided us for its treatment by referring to perfect doctors. She never said I can't help you, this is not my area of concern and so on.... Every time she made sure we get right treatment for my mother. She saved my mother's life by doing diagnosis on right time. Thanks you so much Mam for saving saving my mother's life. 

Mam is very dedicated to her profession. She will always make sure treatment you get is THE BEST in very affordable price. I can't imagine my delivery and my Mom's surgery without her. 

Now the thought of not visiting her every month makes me restless. We will definitely miss every months visit to her clinic üòî

Me and my family will be always thankful for all the strength and support you gave us üôèüòä

I recommend Dr. Vinutha Mam very strongly if you are planning pregnancy or have any gynecological issue. *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** ********** No matter which area you stay in Bangalore the experience is worth that travel.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"We randomly came across a new women's clinic in our area named Divine Clinic run by Dr.Vinutha Prashanth and thought to check it out for issue with my irregular periods. We were just planning for a baby then. In the 1st clinic visit itself, we were filled with positivity and hope. The doctor confidently said I will conceive within the next 3 months & it happened too! I conceived within 2 months and went ahead with my pregnancy consultations too at Divine clinic itself and had a smooth & safe natural delivery! The labour was an induced one due to my low AFI value and the doctor didn't rush for a C-section. The whole induction process was well explained to me the previous day and taken as slow and natural as possible which helped me cope up with the contraction pains. The doctor was present at hospital throughout my labour. The duty doctors/nurses used to continuously report my NST results, vitals etc to Vinutha mam & she used to vigilantly assess them and advise accordingly. She kept in constant touch with duty doctors over calls & whatsapp and visited me personally every now & then to assess my labour progress first hand. The doctor was patient & vigilant throughout my labour and took some timely decisions to help me & the baby when the FHR started dropping. Luckily, I delivered within 3-4 hours of getting good contractions. 
Post delivery, the doctor came to check on me at the odd hours around 10pm  and i was in awe of the kind of family support she must have had. She was at hospital from morning till late night that day. We are very lucky to have found an empathetic doctor like Vinutha mam. 
Reasons why you should choose Dr.Vinutha mam :
1. Vinutha mam is one of the sweetest gynaecologist I have ever met. She is super friendly, always smiling, welcomes you warmly, empathetic and genuinely cares for the patient. In the first visit itself, I'm sure you will get that positive vibe that she is the doctor you can blindly trust & go ahead with. She would give ample time to listen to you no matter what. Every visit is like that, not even once we felt we were not attended properly. She will be like a good friend to you, I bet on that! 
2. She is very passionate about her profession, possess great work ethics, very transparent and never advises unnecessary follow ups/tests/scans/medicines. 
3. She is very approachable & directly available on calls and whatsapp for all patient queries/concerns 24x7 and given her hectic schedule, you will be surprised at the super quick responses you get each time from her.
4. The clinic visits are hassle free. The timings of your appointment are maintained well. All blood tests are done at the clinic itself by the doctor & medicines provided too. The blood test results are promptly updated to you over a call & you can collect them in your next clinic visit at your convenience! All scan/test reports are assessed through whatsapp and no follow ups asked if they are normal!
How much more easy can it get! :)
5. She insists on natural/vaginal birth. 
6. Whenever there is a need for internal check up/pelvic exam, she gently talks to the patient, comforts them first, informs them about the procedure & it's need. This is an important quality a gynaecologist should possess in my opinion. 

Lastly, Going through childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness. In this journey, the presence of a wonderful doctor is simply priceless. Thank you Dr. Vinutha mam for everything and may God bless you abundantly :",2021-12-02 11:27:30,False,True,Ramya K S,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Hi I am glad that I found Dr Vinutha. My whole family is impressed by the way she works. From the confirmation of my pregnancy till post delivery, it's been a smooth journey with her. All my doubts and questions have been answered patiently and on time. She accepts the patients as they are and never complain back, always welcome will her great and simple smile. She gets emotionally attached and hence we feel like sharing our thoughts with our family member. She also explains and make us understand the health issues so well that we will be educated about the things very well. Vinutha Mam is a very friendly, patience, lovely and a safe Dr. to consult. 
I would like to tell about my experience on the day of the delivery. During my regular checkup and follow up Dr was very positive for normal delivery as I had no complications, my height was good and all factors were favoring normal delivery. On that day from morning I was not happy with the baby moments. As per Dr advice I called her after waiting for some time. She asked me to get the NST test done from a nearby hospital and send the report immediately. I got the test done and sent the report. Dr was not happy with the report and asked me to come down to cloudnine. In cloudnine the test was repeated, she was in constant touch with the duty doctors and even got the scan done. She visited the hospital and told us that she was not happy with the results of the NST test and did not want to take chance by sending me back home. She got me admitted and told that she would induce pains in the night and try for normal delivery. In the hospital the doctors monitored me and were updating the same to Dr Vinutha. At around 10.30 my NST report was fluctuating a lot and even pains had started. The baby heart beat was going down when I got my pains. The Duty Dr after consulting Dr Vinutha broke my water bag to checked if baby had passed motion, it was clear and baby had not passed motion. After breaking the water bag my pains increased, Dr Vinutha rushed to the hospital at around 12 at night she came and explained the situation to my family, my babies heart beat was dropping when I got my pains. She told that she could wait for normal delivery only if the heart beat was stable, and she was asking for our consent we gave Dr free hand to take decision. She informed us that she was not keen on waiting taking into account the situation and rushed me to the operation theater for C section. I was taken for C section and I delivered a baby boy at 12.45 night. My baby was almost blue when he was born and was rushed to NICU as he was facing breathing difficulty. Dr Vinutha finished my surgery waited for the pediatrician to check my child went and spoke to the pediatrician and confirmed that the baby is doing good before leaving the hospital at around 2.30 in the night. Later we came to know that I had a placenta abruption (a very rare scenario) and had blood clots on the uterus because of which my baby was not getting required blood and oxygen. I was very lucky enough that Dr Vinutha mam took a correct and timely decision to take me for C section. Because of Dr Vinutha I and my baby are safe and healthy today. Me and my family are indebted to Dr Vinutha Mam. Thanks a lot Mam for your kind gestures. I will infact miss meeting you every month henceforth .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Here is my amazing experience with a wonderful doctor. 

I convinced in the month of March and the COVID situation arised everywhere. Not knowing which doctor to consult due to travelling restrictions we started to look for a doctor close to our house. 

That's when we came across Doctor Vinutha and her reviews were so good, hence we tried to give her a shot. Trust me I visited her once and I never looked back. 

Not only me but my entire family is in awe of her... Like you have already read that she shares her personal number through which she is in constant touch with you and clarifies all your normal to silly doubts, and guides you during emergencies. 

During my pregnancy she was very encouraging and sweet, she always encouraged me to do my work and keep myself busy and preoccupied. She never stopped me from anything, let it be eating or playing. The Only time she ever told me no was to stop me from drinking soda and eating fast foods. 

Doctor never asked me to visit her that frequently looking at the situation, she asked me to get my tests done and WhatsApp her the reports. She was always available to talk let it be during the night or early morning. 
She would happily respond to all my doubts and quiries without getting irritated. 

The pregnancy was smooth till 7th month, as I entered my 8th month, I started getting severe cramps and pain. I had entered into early labour and doctor admitted me immediately for observation. She not only personally stayed in touch with my parents but Also expained to us why she admitted me. She was very sure on not to get me into early delivery. She did everything possible to make sure I don't deliver and then when I was stable she sent be home and asked me to be on bed rest till I completed my 9 months. 

I had constant contactions but doctor was very positive and was very sure that she wanted me to have a normal delivery, hence she always gave me an option to induce my pain to deliver but also explained the consequences and encouraged me to have a normal delivery. 

We waited and then I made it till week 39. But due to unavoidable circumstances my doctor had to go out of station and I completely understand because in this 9 months I have never heard her saying she is on leave or on break. I have always heard her say I had delivery, my patients are waiting etc. Once I visited twice in a gap of three days and those three days too she was just at hospital making sure her patients had safe delivery. 

Hence, when she said unavoidable situation, I could completely understand and she ensured me that in her absence if I enter into labour she will make sure that I'll have the most safe and secure delivery. And what I feared came upon me, I entered into labour in my doctor's absence. The best part was even when she was traveling she replied to all my messages. when I got admitted due to my Labour pain, my doctor requested Dr. Varna Rao to take care of me and my delivery. Dr. Vinutha was in constant touch with Dr. Varna and dr. Varna was updating her about my progression. 
When I entered my active labour I still remember dr. Varna called my doctor to tell that I was ready to deliver and that she was going ahead with the delivery. 

I had the most safest delivery,  if am not wrong my active labour ended in less than two minutes and I am blessed with a beautiful baby girl. All thanks to my dear doctors. They did not induce labour pain, nor did they mess with the process, but they waited patiently..they made sure I had the most normal, natural and safest delivery. 

I specifically want to thank my doctor vinutha for encouraging me since day 1 and preparing me and my body for natural birth by encouraging me and strengthening me.. 

And yes a person can never do so much without the support from her family, the way her family supports and encourages her is just amazing, hats off to her and her blessed family... I am in awe of dr. Vinutha and her family. I am happy I met a person/ doctor like her in my life's journey who has become so close to my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Complicated Pregnancy Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My wife, after several years got pregnant through IVF, went to IVF hospital in the month of October and in November we got the sweet result. After that regular checkup, every thing was going well, 1st trimester then 2nd trimester we started countdown but at the start of 3rd trimester, Doctor then revealed that she had short cervix in the month of Jun with 29 weeks of pregnancy, doctor said that she will have preterm delivery. The word preterm shocked us, baby going to NICU, growing with the support of machines, thinking of it was very scary. We didn't know what to do, the doctor said to be on full bed rest and to try to pull upto 34weeks. That was very long way to go.
Then after that began the search for this situation, went to near by hospitals but there were no NICU for that long of preterm. Then went to all known hospital there the doctor advised for cervical cerclage, there she said that as  it will be a preterm why not to take chances. We couldn't agree with her.
Next day contacted a hospital which had Level III NICU, then we said the issue, after which the hospital staff gave us number of Dr Vinutha Prashanth. By then doctor herself called us and we told entire event. She then called us to the hospital. Next day we went to hospital where my wife was examined, after that Dr Vinutha explained every thing in detail as to what would happen and what and all treatment will be needed in case of preterm delivery. She then said my wife will have normal delivery. That was different as IVF pregnancies usually have to go through C section. Dr Vinutha explanation  was very simple to understand and we were convinced with her. Later doctor advised to get admitted as my wife needed complete bed rest not to get out of bed other than to the washroom.
After that my wife was monitored daily through examination and NST. There was Dr Vinutha checking  twice daily. Dr Vinutha, she is excellent in her approach towards the case. ***** ********** *** *********** **** ** *********. Doctor then got as USG done to check the growth and condition of the baby. She said that the baby is good and not to worry. After 33 weeks Dr Vinutha was very positive that my wife may hold on upto 34-35 weeks, then there was no fear of baby going to NICU, as the baby was doing well in her mother's tummy. Then the day came at 34.3weeks, at around 6 in the evening water came out, my wife was shifted to labour room and at 9pm we had a baby boy delivered normally, no C section, Dr Vinutha was there delivering my baby, as promised she got him by normal delivery. Our baby was 2.2kg, Neonatologists were there who checked on and said that the baby is healthy and doing good. Our baby was in NICU for a day only for check up. Next day he was there with her mother. 
All thanks to our Dr Vinutha Prashanth, her professionalism, determination, kindness and excellent approach towards the case, made our life. Just one thing to say ""she is one gem of a doctor"".

Happy to update that with her very utmost care & concerns we are blessed with baby boy (from Normal delivery)  
During my wife‚Äôs first pregnancy we had consulted Dr (Gynecologists) who is in Vijayanagar (Bangalore South) after meeting a couple of Gynecologists. She was good in advising, but not to the level of care or information‚Äôs to be passed for the 1st pregnancy lady. We were not so satisfied with the overall interactions & consultations.
But for my wife‚Äôs 2nd pregnancy we had contacted Dr Vinutha Prashanth as we had come to know about her professionalism, utmost care for her patient‚Äôs, guiding, consulting with clearing every doubts with patience etc through my cousins wife who got consultations from her.

When we met her for the first time itself we were very impressed & surprised to see the Dr in Bangalore (even in her busy schedules) with so much of patience to list to patients & guiding with all instructions giving confidence of all assurance from her side. 
For example- She gave her number on our 1st visit itself & asked to call her anytime if incase of any problem or inconveniences caused which we hardly see in many a doctor‚Äôs.
Her way of talking, concerns & confidence giving consultations gave a full strength to my wife. In her 2nd pregnancy I never saw my wife worried or tensed or uncomfortable (having certain doubts in mind). Which I had seen lots of those kinds in her 1st pregnancy. 
We both don‚Äôt any words to express about car taking of her patients. It‚Äôs just awesome & unimaginable. I feel we just don‚Äôt have any words to express & just say thanks to her.
One main thing I have to say that we are basically from north Karnataka & had decision of going to our home town for the delivery. But because of Dr Vinutha Prashanth‚Äôs care & her professionalism we canceled our plan & decided to have the delivery from her itself.
For your updates it was not mine or my wife‚Äôs decision but it was whole of our family‚Äôs decision to have the delivery from her side. So you can understand what her impression is & believe our whole family is having. 
On the delivery day we called Dr Vinutha Prashanth before leaving the house & reached Ovum hospital at 5.15 AM. Even at that odd hour she visited immediately & gave confidence & assurance to my wife. And till my wife leaves for labor room she was either present in the hospital or was taking continuous updates from the duty doctor. Infact she use to give me also the confidence that not worry & everything will be alright. She was continuously monitoring on how my wife was progressing, baby's health (heartbeat) and kept the OT ready in case of any emergencies. She has been calm and patient with us throughout this pregnancy.
By God's grace everything went well. Both the mother and the baby are healthy and doing well.
Thank you so much from bottom of my heart for your all the help Dr Vinuth.

Doctor explained each and every process of pain induction, what are possible outcome, what are following process for each outcome.
After couple of induction there was no improvement.

She has a good decision making ability, extremely patient and dedicated towards her patients and work. I delivered my baby boy in Cloudnine Hospital, Kanakapura road, Bengaluru through LSCS done by Vinutha ma‚Äôam and her team. She gets emotionally attached to her patients and their family as though it's her own family. The best part is she visited regularly before and even after delivery no matter how late it got like 9:30/10 pm after finishing consultations at her clinic. In fact she even visited when my baby got readmitted due to jaundice relapse. ***** *** ** *** **** ************* **** **** **** ******* Thank you so much from me and my family Vinutha ma‚Äôam for everything, you are a wonderful doctor one can have during their pregnancy and delivery. From the confirmation of my pregnancy till delivery and post delivery, it's been a smooth journey with you. !! I strongly recommend her for anyone who wants a positive pregnancy and delivery. I will miss meeting and interacting with you. You are really a blessing to all expecting parents. ‚ù§Ô∏è

The happiness of having our first baby and that too with normal delivery cannot be fully expressed in words, however here‚Äôs my attempt to share our experience throughout the journey.

This review is regarding our introduction to a new experience called parenthood. We feel very lucky to have been consulting Vinutha ma‚Äôam at Cloudnine Kanakapura Road from the very first month of pregnancy till delivery and post sessions. 

When the pregnancy test at home was positive, we were not even sure of wanting the baby.  We met Dr Vinutha at the hospital then for the first time and she was extremely calm and reassuring on how this is a part of life and everything goes along together. 

During all our follow up sessions, she has been informing and guiding us on what to expect ahead along with the essential pregnancy care. She also provided exercises to assist with a normal delivery well in advance and was available on phone for any queries or emergency. 

Dr Vinutha did ensure to keep us posted on the status of the baby and advised on important things to note. She has been extremely informative during her explanations and reviews which helped us remain assured about the next course of action. 

Foremost, she ensured to keep my wife confident and determined that a normal delivery is perfectly possible and that there was absolutely nothing to worry about. Her confidence was quite reassuring and motivating towards ensuring a happy delivery experience. 

Thank you, ma‚Äôam, for all your assistance and availability throughout. The experience of being in the delivery room with such a fine doctor was heartening and blissful, the best moment of my life!",2022-12-25 06:02:18,False,True,Dhanesh Gopika,,,

We visited her in cloudnine kanakpura branch. In our first visit itself we were convinced to continue with her. She is very friendly, listens attentively and comfortable to approach. She asks only for necessary tests, scans and explains why they are needed. She is available on whatsapp for queries.

Unexpectedly in 33rd week i had aminuotic fluid leak and was admitted. I gave sleepless nights to Dr. She was very supportive and clearly explained family members about the next proceedings. Dr. was strongly trying to push delivery by a week so that baby develops well in womb. Medicines were provided for lung development, to avoid infection , scans and NST were done regularly. This was my first pregnancy after 6 years of marriage and she knew how precious this baby was for us. She was genuinely caring and focused towards safe delivery of baby.
On 5th day after admission early in the morning baby heart rate increased and Dr. immediately took the call for c section. I was quickly shifted to labor ward , everything went well and was blessed with baby boy.
Furthermore, i faced severe gastritis issue before and after delivery. Scans , ECGs were done and Dr. assessed the situation and provided medication accordingly. From admission till discharge Dr. visited us frequently, monitored  constantly and guided  the duty staff.  She was always available when needed and gave me confidence throughout my delivery.
I am glad we chose Dr. Vinutha. I strongly recommend her to my friends and relatives. 
Thanks Dr. for all you have done for us. Wish you and your family good health and happiness.

positive ray of hope, which was worth it. She is a friendly person and welcomes with a warmth and smile always.
She never hesitates to answer even the silly queries that we put forth. The clinic is maintained well, credits to her
assistant in charge who takes care of all these stuff. Till my 9 months of checkup whenever we meet its always been 
a conversation with loads of smile and no hard feelings.
During the phase of pregnancy i had the normal checkups and scans done smoothly, and never had any complications.
she will suggest only the tests or scans that is needed based on the individuals health concern. She's very reachable, she replies to your questions over WhatsApp and also responds to calls in emergency situations.
Ideally, the whole journey of pregnancy and checkup was completely a cakewalk for me.

This was my 2nd pregnancy after a gap of 7 years, and i personally had so much confusions of choosing normal or 
c-section since my first baby is also c-section. but doctor took time to make us understand on the risks involved 
in opting normal after c-section even though there is a long gap, she gave clear idea on scar ruptures that happen for 
the mother when second is a normal delivery. Thinking of my health and baby to struggle more to get normally delivered,
we mentally got fine with opting a planned C-section. During the delivery time, all process went smoothly and i never
felt any anguish or complexity. By God's grace and Doctor's effort , delivered girl baby on 30th July 2022.
The baby was healthy and weighed 3.6. Baby health was constant and good sign to discharge in two days of delivery.
I strongly recommend to go with Dr.Vinutha for a smooth pregnancy journey and delivery phase. 
She always enquire about the my health and baby‚Äôs health even after the delivery.  I don‚Äôt think any of the other doctors will do a follow up after the delivery. Thanks to Dr.Vinutha mam and team of Cloudnine for making the delivery a smooth phase and return home healthily.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I‚Äôm very happy to have Dr.Vinutha Prashanth as my obstetrician for several reasons. I first visited her for my delayed periods with PCOS and she motivated me to take up  good lifestyle habits and diet plan which corrected my cycles with very less medication and since then she has been with me throughout my pregnancy journey as well. 

I have been seeing her since day 1 of my pregnancy, she explains all the necessary things in detail and she always motivated me to take up my pregnancy very well. She only suggest necessary scans and medications throughout, also very well explains the need of every scan, blood tests and medications. I had been very active throughout my pregnancy and all thanks to her. She was always a phone call away for any of my queries at any time of the day. 

Although I had completed 40 weeks of my pregnancy, I did not have any symptoms of labour then she clearly explained me about inducing labour since I always wanted NVD and Dr.Vinutha as well motivated me to go for NVD. 

At the end of 40th week I opted for labour induction and the procedure started and it went for a day and half long and my body did not support the medication and it was a failed induction, also baby‚Äôs head was not yet fixed which made it more difficult. Throughout the process she made sure that she had a constant check on my condition and she always took care of me. 

After all this, she clearly explained me the process of waiting for labour pain and consequences and then we decided to go for C-section late in the night and immediately informed her. She did not hesitate to visit us late in the night and to take up the operation at that time. I was so relaxed to see her at that time since I knew that me and my baby were in safe hands. 

Went into OT at 9:50 PM and we had our beautiful girl with us by 10:10 PM. I‚Äôm always grateful to Dr. Vinutha Prashant for her humbleness, commitment, care and concern she has towards her patients. 

She has also helped my cousins and friends with their gynaecology problems as well and they are happy with the results. 

I would strongly recommend Dr.Vinutha to all the women around.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Firstly my wife and I want to thank Google  suggesting wonderful gynecologist in our locality. Also, clinic is maintained very well.

We visited Divine Women's Healthcare clinic after seeing reviews which are posted in Google. Trust us it was not a surprise in the other way, doctor is very much approachable, polite and humble. We have never seen such a polite and friendly doctor in our entire life. Doctor responds to our call and messages if we need any information or in the matter of emergency. 

We met Doctor Vinutha when my wife was one month pregnant. Doctor had clearly explained all the  plan of actions that we need to take care in this nine months journey in every stages.

Doctor usually don't recommend too many scannings or medical tests unless there are any irregularities. However, she recommends scannings for mother at each trimester to determine the growth/health of baby. 

Usually other doctors recommends their own set of hospital for delivery based on their convenience. But Vinutha doctor will respect our decision to choose hospital for delivery based on the proximity from our locality. 

As the date was approaching towards delivery doctor was so friendly with my wife as the level of trauma reduceds to some extent. 

During final trimester my wife suffered from Polyhydramnios. Doctor had politely made us understand what are the concequences that we may come across in the future and we were also mentally prepared for that. 

Due to above extremely condition my wife had to go for cesarean delivery as we don't want to risk mother's or baby's life. Upon our decision doctor agreed to take case. 

On the date of case doctor was very much approachable and she always respected our decision.

On 20th July 2022 my wife and I have been blessed with cute girl baby‚ù§Ô∏è We are extremely happyüòä

Post pregnancy doctor had taken utmost care of my wife until she is discharged from the hospital. 

I have never seen such a dedicated doctor in my entire life for making betterment in patients life üòä

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Caesarean Section (C Section),Pregnancy Scan,",0,0,YES,"Mine was a high risk pregnancy because of my age (38yrs) and past 2 miscarriages. And I am so grateful  that I found Dr. Vinutha during this journey of mine. Right from day one she has worked with me on lowering my anxiety and instilling me with positive thoughts. These close to 9 months weren't easy for me but Dr. Vinutha made sure that we monitor my health and baby's growth regularly. To complicate matters further, I developed gestational diabetes and chloestasis both of which were caught early because of her careful listening and observation. I was rest assured that I am in safe hands. I had Dr. Vinutha's constant 24X7 support on phone and when I told her about my Cholestasis symptoms, without any further delay she took a call to put me on steroids which helped my baby strengthen her lungs and mature the other organs too. At around 36 weeks my precious lil daughter came into this world. For this precious lil gift I will forever be indebted to Dr. Vinutha.  She's like a champion warrior and I am so glad I found her on my side during this uphill battle.

Few more pointers which set Dr. Vinutha apart from everyone else are: 

She is passionate about helping the mom to be and can think from their perspective. **** *********** ***** *** ***** **** ***** ** ** ****** ** ****** ******** 

She has always been very  receptive to what I had to say and clarified our doubts at each and every step. 

Can't put this in any other better way, but money is the last thing  on her mind. Mother's and baby's care is of topmost priority. She is basically a friend and a guide who will make this important journey stress free and smooth for you. 

I highly recommend Dr. Vinutha to each and everyone who wants to
enjoy this special phase of their life. 

One last tip for all moms to be, pls do watch Dr. Vinutha's video on Facebook so that you also can be prepared for step by step development of your baby during your pregnancy.",2022-08-08 12:29:44,False,True,vatsala,,,

She was always reachable through WhatsApp and calls for any emergency or any queries. She responded and calmly guided well with next steps even in the midnight when I went into labour.

She has been really supporting right from the beginning.. I felt comfortable with her in the first meeting itself because of her down to earth attitude and understanding nature. she encouraged and cleared many doubts and fears and I'll be thankful to her always for that. She explains things clearly and maintains transparency till the end. She listens with patience and suggests the best always. She never prescribed *********** ********* ** so called sugary health drinks and insisted on having a natural healthy diet.There have been instances when I could not reach clinic in time for regular check ups but she never complained. She is very considerate and helpful.

I faced a tough time with an ankle fracture in my 5th month and its so sweet of her that she felt very disheartened that I can't do exercises that can help for normal delivery, that shows how dedicated she is towards encouraging a healthy normal delivery if the expectant mother also chooses the same .. nevertheless she waited for the right time and suggested all the exercises as soon as i healed and stressed on doing those exercises everyday, and i simply followed her and had complete trust in her and her expertise.

One day I had a sudden episode of severe lower abdominal pain and blackout. I went back to Dr. Vinutha as my physician suggested a pelvic scan. Dr. Vinutha found that I had an ectopic pregnancy and it needed urgent care and monitoring. As my beta HCG levels were lower than 1000, she suggested to continuously monitor the beta HCG levels every 48 hours and personally monitored me and gave her personal number to reach out in case of even slightest discomfort. She had explained us in detail about ectopic pregnancy and the risks of rupture within the tube and complications. While i was doing ok for a week, I had another episode of severe pain and blackout. She immediately asked me to admit in emergency and started monitoring my vitals every 30 minutes and kept assessing if I need a surgery as there was internal bleeding. She monitored me whole night for every 30 minutes and that gave me a lot of reassurance as I went with lot of pain and was very scared. She monitored my bp, pulse, hemoglobin levels and conducted scans to see if the internal bleeding was increasing. All this was done throughout the night and she was in constant touch with me and the nurses who were attending me. However, as my vitals were stable and my blood count didn't fall further, she assured that I will be alright and don't need a surgery as that would lead to further recovery period and it was not needed in my case. She gave us the option to decide and strongly recommended that we don't get the surgery. Although we were very scared, we trusted her and we are happy we did so. After 2 days of monitoring, she discharged me and explained how I should still expect some pain and also monitor my beta HCG every 48 hours. Now after 3 weeks, my beta HCG has gone down below 30 and my pain has reduced. I am feeling completely alright and all this without a surgery. I am thankful to Dr. Vinutha for her right advice, her utmost care, friendliness and her reassurance when we needed the most. ",2022-07-14 13:04:26,False,True,Hema Shivananda,,,

I feel she is one the best and rightest decisions we made during my pregnancy. 

Dr. Vinutha is a very friendly doctor whom we can comfortably ask any number of queries. She patiently listens to all of them and clarifies the same. She is also available for WhatsApp chat and responds to our concerns there too without fail. She always asked to share all scan or test reports there and avoid separate consultation for this alone, which I feel we rarely hear these days.

During this journey she always insisted and guided on following right diet, and never encouraged over medication or unnecessary scans or tests. She guided on the pregnancy exercise and it‚Äôs importance when one goes for normal vaginal delivery.

During labour, when I called her and informed she ensured that we don‚Äôt panic and asked us to visit hospital. She was already there when we reached and I did feel the warmth just like from a very dear family member through her presence and comforting words. She was present throughout my labour and delivered our precious little boy around 11:30 PM. The doctor did wait for an hour more in the hospital and ensured that I was fine before she left late in the night.

This is my second delivery. Due to a bad and sad experience of my first delivery elsewhere, searched a lot and finally got to know about Vinutha Doctor. The first meet with her made us feel like this is the doctor to go for. Been 9 months and I delivered a baby boy with all effort, concern and care of the doctor. We are a happy couple with two kids, but just to go to her again, we feel like having an other kid. 

The doctor is very professional, powerful at the hospital, while also being friendly, humble, simplicity and caring which is kind of contradicting to each other. She does not give you unnecessary tablets, different growth powders (previous experience), no unnecessary scans, no dramas, and very affordable and very very approachable. We have even called her at night sometimes and she provided necessary suggestions. Just her words ""Nothing to worry"" was my huge strength.

Finally we got admitted to cloudnine hospital for delivery and the doctor helped deliver our baby through c section (first baby was also c section). The second day I had breathing issues (since I am not comfortable to ac and windows were closed) and immediately made sure necessary medication is given. The third day I was up and running. It's rare to say this about the doctor, but I miss seeing her regularly after the delivery. After the delivery I wanted to see her face first as there is someone there to care for me . 

Today is the forth day after the operation and I am walking and talking normally and writing this review. In my previous operation, I took 20 days to recover like this.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I approached Dr. Vinutha for the first time in the month of July, 2021 (i.e., in my sixth month of pregnancy). I visited her in Cloud Nine hospital, Kanakapura branch. During the first visit itself, I came to know that doctor is very polite and friendly person. This helped me to have a comfortable interaction with the doctor throughout this pregnancy journey. Whenever I visit the doctor, she always gives enough time to address whatever the queries I had. First she always listens to me with utmost patience and then answer all my queries very clearly and concisely without creating any confusion.

When I came to know about my gestational diabetes, doctor explained me everything related to that without scaring us. She also suggested to follow a proper diet (directed us to a very good dietician) and make me believe that it can be controlled easily by following a diet without going for the medicine. She asked me to monitor the sugar levels (if possible) on a weekly basis (at first) and twice/ thrice in a week during the later stages of my pregnancy. I used to send my sugar levels to the doctor by watsapp and she used to guide me through watsapp only. This helped to keep my sugar levels very much under control till my last day of the pregnancy without taking any medicine. She was just a phone call away for any queries I had.

She always used to tell me to do yoga, walking and pregnancy exercises to have a normal delivery. Even if I tell her saying it will be difficult for me to do the exercises during my 8th and 9th month, she used to motivate me by providing the mental strength to do the exercises. Of course, it helped me a lot during my pregnancy journey. 

Finally, I am blessed with a beautiful baby GIRL in my 40th week of the pregnancy (it was a normal delivery). A big thanks to Dr. Vinutha for providing all the help, guidance, care and assistance during this wonderful journey of my pregnancy.

One of the highlighting features of the clinic is there is facility to collect sample for tests like CBC, double marker etc and they send the sample to the lab to get it checked & collect the reports. once the results are available, the doctor is kind enough to verify it and we would get a call from clinic about the update. And we used to collect reports only during next visit. This helped us in avoiding unnecessary movement to labs, especially during covid 2nd peak time. (Also it saved my time, myself being a working professional)

During each of the visit, she always listened to my silliest doubts / questions patiently and never got angry or irritated. She always explained why each of the test she is prescribing is needed and what is happening in the process of my pregnancy. She was always very frank and honest and didn't give any false hopes. She was always available to calls or whatsapp for any issues; its rare to see such a surgeon so easily available to her patients! 

Mine was a planned c-section due to some complications. Though i was mentally prepared for the operation, when i saw OT, i started to panic. Glad that she spoke to me and made me comfortable. Also during my stay in the hospital, she ensured to visit me once a day and motivated me to get back to normalcy ASAP. She didn't let me simply lie on bed (which my family wanted me to) and asked me to start walking, be active. This has really helped me to bounce back, i feel; it has not made me feel like a patient but a mother!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"We were searching for a doctor who is simple and insists on Normal-delivery over the C-Section and that is when we found out about Dr. Vinutha Prashanth through Practo and Google, we are really happy now that we chose her. We found the adress of her clinic (Divine Women & Child Speciality Clinic) and visited her and we were impressed with the way she listened to everything with patience and explained in detail on how our pregnancy journey will be for the months to come, so we decided that she is right doctor for our requirements. She is very patient and explains everything in details. She is very prompt to answer the call and respond to whatsaap messages immediately if we have any concerns or queries. We had a very possitive journey of 9 months in her guidance. She never gave us any unnecessary medication and she always encouraged us to gain the required proteins and vitamins naturally through the food we consume. In our case, unfortunately the water broke and we had to go for C-Section. The water broke in the morning and we immediately called the doctor and she advised us to visit the hospital, by the time we reach the hospital, she had informed the nursing staff over there to complete the primary checks and update her. She rushed to the hospital as soon as possible and examined me and our baby thoroughly and advised us to get admitted immediately. Through the regular scans we had noticed nuchal cord or Cord-Around-the Neck of the baby was present and since the water had broken our baby was facing few difficulties (heart beat used to drop occasionally and then it used to get back to normal) so we did not have much time to wait for the natural labour pain to occur. She gave us lot of courage and she was monitoring the situation closely and was very patient to wait for almost 10 hours after my water had broken. Since things did not work the way we wanted we had to take the decision to go for C-Section. One thing that makes Dr. Vinutha stand out from the rest is the combination of patience, knowledge and the caring nature that she has towards people who consult her.

I was searching for the doctor online, We came to know about Dr. Vinutha after some online searches. She came highly recommended and decided to contact her.
After explaining my concern with doctor, she convinced me to go ahead with the baby. She was also highly empathetic and deeply concerned about the health of the mother to be.

During in person consultation she would give ample time, ask us if we have any query or doubt. She doesn't recommend any unnecessary procedure or tests and always gives a valid reason behind any test she would ask to get done. 
I tested Covid positive and as per scanning my baby had delayed growth on 8th month of pregenncy, but vinutha had given hopes on not to worry on baby growth and everything would be fine. Her positive attitude made us to relax.
Since i had breach presentation baby we had to go ahead with C section.
I delivered healthy baby boy on 4th of June with a assistance of Vinutha,she took care of me well till the time i get discharged from hospital.
 Our baby is 15 days old and healthy.

I had a multiple polyps in uterus , doctor suggested to operate to get  concieved but before operating 
I got to know I am carrying :) on sept 17 2020.Initial days of pregnancy i was consulting doctor in my home town.
When I decided that I will be delivering in banglore,my friend has suggested Dr.Vinutha.As she stays far from my place we were in dilemma whether to go or not initially .By god's grace we thought to meet her first ,she was a active speaker and I got some positive vibes in the first meet .
We decided and we were going for routine checkup in her clinic and she used to tell to do yoga and other excercises to have  normal easy delivery .She was very much confident that I ll have normal delivery but I was ok to have c section if situation demands and pain was uncontrollable.

Finally the day has arrived ,may 1st 2021 ,I had weekly (39 th week)visit with dr.Vinutha  in the evening and we were expecting anytime labour within 15 days but way back to home itself I felt water break , Vinutha madam asked me to check for few hours to go hospital ..then again we were asked to go ovum hospital and check with the duty doctor if I had any doubt of water break .Then at 11 we rushed to ovum hospital and after consulting they wanted to keep me in observation overnight then Sunday morning Dr.Vinutha visited me and told She will deliver today and induced injection to get pain around 8 A.M and I had horrible labour pain I could not bare the pain and requested for c section ,Everyone lost hopes of normal  delivery by seeing my condition.But Dr. Vinutha was very confident about me delivering normally and she was consoling my family and moral support to them at that time.Finally @10 pm may 2 nd i could hear my prince crying.I could only smile and thank  doctors who were with me in OPD.

It's very rare these days to see doctor like Vinutha madam who can take risk  and work for normal delivery .Now everyone tells I am lucky that I got doctor like Vinutha .

Before I write more details in this review, I wanted to thank Dr. Vinutha Prashanth for her help, support, kindness, and care. Thank you doctor, we 3 are grateful that we chose you as our doctor through this amazing journey.

When I got to know I‚Äôm pregnant, we first consulted at a leading hospital near our house. They did the scan immediately, blood tests and confirmed its pregnancy. However from there my night mare started with loads of hormone tablets and injections. I did asked with that doctor why should i be on this hormone tablets, we were not given any acceptable answer.  They also made me to do scans every 3 days in a span of 1.5 weeks. At last i was fed up and was searching for a good Gynaecologist nearby and  i found out Dr. Vinutha Prashanth through google.

I visited Dr. Vinutha first in August and with the first visit itself i was very comfortable and she did spend quality time to listen to me. She infact asked me why am i having these hormone tablets?. She asked me to stop all those hormone tablets and then put me on minimal vital tablets for pregnancy. That itself was a relief for me. From there our journey began with Dr. Vinutha and trust me that was the best decision me and my hubby made. She was available every time  when ever i had questions and supported me emotionally through this entire phase. Her patience to listen to her patients is commendable. My delivery experience was so smooth and she explained us each aspects on time. Moreover she supported me emotionally and also allowed my hubby to be with me during my delivery time. That was a major relief i had and i am always thankful to you Doctor.

Finally a big thanks from me, husband and Izahaak. Doctor, Definitely once he grows up, I am going to tell him this piece of story from my life in which your foot print is firmly affixed.

All the best for you and wish you all the success. Doctors like you are equal to God.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"This being my first pregnancy we wanted nothing but the best doctor. Me and my husband have done a lot of research and  checked all the gynaecologists on Practo and google reviews. Finally we have narrowed down on 2 doctors out of which Dr Vinutha Prashanth is the second one on the list. After consulting the first doctor we weren‚Äôt satisfied and consulted Dr Vinutha, in the first meet itself we felt that we can completely trust her with our pregnancy. I‚Äôm someone who always over thinks and gets into a panic mode easily but Dr Vinutha always with her calm manner used to talk to me and clear all my inhibitions. She‚Äôs someone who keeps in touch with the patients even on phone So that we can get any medical advice immediately. She always made us feel comfortable and cleared all our doubts and also pushed me to do prenatal yoga and regular exercise. She has never prescribed me unnecessary medicines or scans. She has mentally prepared me for the labour so that I don‚Äôt panic in the last moment which most of the doctors don‚Äôt do. Finally she has waited for almost 10hrs of my labour and has been with me through out constantly pushing me and giving me confidence that I can do it. Without her I couldn‚Äôt even imagine having a Normal Vaginal delivery. 
I would give 100% credits to Dr Vinutha Prashanth for me having a normal delivery and also a very smooth pregnancy journey.
She has been a pillar of support and I would blindly trust her for any medical advice in future.

We started going for regular check ups at her clinic. Through out the pregnancy, she explained each and every little thing in detail. The various tests carried out were explained elaborately. She never suggested any medicine or test  if not really required. She was very patient with all our queries and tried to clear all our doubts and concerns without any hesitation. She was always available either through call or in person. Dr Vinutha gave me confidence and fully supported my decision to go for normal vaginal delivery. 
In my 37th week of pregnancy, my water broke without any pains. I immediately contacted her and rushed to the hospital, and within no time she was available to help me handle the situation. Even though I didn‚Äôt get any contractions, she assured me that she will try her best to give me a normal delivery. I was induced with pain and after 22 hours of long labour I delivered a healthy baby boy through vaginal delivery and all thanks to Dr. Vinutha who never lost hope on me.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I am feeling very happy to share my experience with Dr.Vinutha. 
Due to COVID situation and this being my first pregnancy, I found it challenging to get a good Gynecologist. Finally during my 3rd month, I found one with whom I consulted throughout my pregnancy. 

The doctor I was consulting suggested Ovum for delivery and had given me a due date. However, we had to rush to Ovum a week earlier to the given date due to an emergency. This is when things went haywire because our doctor was on a vacation and out of Bengaluru for next few days. Myself and my husband went into panic mode instantly and this is when our doctor suggested us to take help from Dr.Vinutha. At this juncture, we were completely clueless and worried about next steps. It was already 6PM at that time.

Just after a single phone conversation with Dr.Vinutha, all my doubts/anxiety were cleared and with her assurance I was ready for delivery in next few hours. It was not just me, but my husband also received similar assurance and positive messages from her. Delivery itself was very smooth and memorable experience. Post delivery, Dr.Vinutha's suggestions and care helped me take care of baby and myself seamlessly. Although my interactions with Dr.Vinutha were only for few hours before delivery, due to her cordial interactions I feel like I have known her for a long time. 

I strongly recommend Dr.Vinutha Prashanth for any pregnancy related consultations. Me and my husband are very grateful to her for taking care of my delivery in such a magical way! :)",2020-11-01 11:21:37,False,True,Sahana vikram,Thanks sahana ,2020-11-03T13:58:00+0000,Dr. Vinutha Prashanth

I was consulting at a small clinic which i was okay till 5/6 months but later i lost the trust in the Dr. who never motivates or talks about normal delivery, she more insisted about C section.

After a thorough research, sleepless google review readings i chose Dr.Vinutha Prasanth. She seemed to have tons of positive review for her Devotion, Simplicity, Transparency.  

On the 1st meet/appointment, we felt very  comfortable with Dr. Vinutha. She ensured that all of our doubts, concerns, expectation were fulfilled that indeed restored the TRUST. She too believes in natural delivery unless if the medical condition requires. Doesn‚Äôt prescribe a medicine, test if not really required. 

Visited for about 3 times before the delivery , with her experience suggested to get admitted after hearing about the early labour symptoms by 38 weeks. Admitted wife, after 12 hours wife delivered baby girl( Normal delivery üòç). The pre/post delivery follow ups from her are outstanding, she was always available over to phone to help( not sure if all Dr do this) The hassle, the risk that we took all has paid off , a simple thank you wouldn‚Äôt justify her effort. 

Over all a wonderful experience, i would recommend Dr. Vinutha for both women & child care, it‚Äôs worth all your time even if you have to travel from long distance, in my case it‚Äôs was electronic city.

We came across Dr. Vinutha Prashanth based on a recommendation from a friend who had been visiting her for some time.

She visited the hospital @4.30AM morning for the delivery at cloudnine hospital, lot of respect for her profession, as the doctor needs to visit patients in odd hours for the deliveries.

Some point of time, we thought of going for c-section due to unbearable pain, However, she was very strong and confident to make it to the normal delivery (If there are chances of normal delivery, she won't let you go for c-section for sure, she actually gives confidence to you)

	‚Ä¢ She is very polite, takes time to explain things in detail with all pros and cons with transparency.
	‚Ä¢ She gave us so much moral support throughout our pregnancy. 
	‚Ä¢ She always addressed our concern patiently, be it in person or through WhatsApp(Despite of her busy schedule, she makes sure she respond to each and every query on time). 
	‚Ä¢ She values time and money, does not call us for unnecessary consultation. Most of the reports she asks to share on whatsApp instead of asking us to come again for the same. 
	‚Ä¢ She always encourages normal delivery and she is greatest blessing to us for our normal delivery. 
	‚Ä¢ We always had that positive vibes every time we met her. She is an angel down to earth (As a person than Doctor). Even in the labour room, We felt so much relaxed after seeing her despite of the pain my wife was going through. She was the one whom we could blindly trust.

And my journey went very well and smooth only because of Dr. Vinutha Prashanth ma'am.. She's an intelligent doctor with human values.

I regularly visited her clinic from the day 1 till the end, it's a well maintained place.

The first impression about my doctor was her friendliness. That gave me more comfort to ask or talk anything.. Her confidence and energy made everything look easier for me And she explains everything in detail like what are the procedures, why those tests and scans are required and clears any doubts related to pregnancy. And she was always available to get in touch by phone. 

I always feel like she's my sister. I exactly did what she told me to. I never had any complication or tough times through out my pregnancy. And that's the best part when you get a nice gynaec like her. 

Though she tried for normal, I successfully delivered my baby girl via C sec, since I had little complication during labor.. But I never regret for what I went through.. I'm so lucky to get a good doctor like her in my life.. I still miss those regular visits and those lovely talks ma'am.. Can't thank you enough.

I already reffered her to my friends. They are also happy with her treatment. I would highly recommend her..

Also she makes sure that your money is not wasted on the unnecessary scans/tests.  Going further, we got to know that the fetus is small from the growth scan and we were nervous on the outcome but doctor really encouraged and strengthened us. She took complete responsibility and regularly monitored the growth of the fetus from 7th month till end of 38th week with regular scans and NST tests only when required. The fluid was reduced in 37th week and she still tried her best to push the delivery to 38th week to make sure that baby shouldn't have further complications after delivery. She tried her best for the normal delivery by inducing pain but since I did not get pain, I opted for the c-section.

She will take extra time to explain the need of each scan or the blood test to be done. One main thing which I liked about her was she will never make you spend money on scans or tests unnecessarily. 

Even in the OT while operating, she was talking to me so well which helped me a lot. She was always reachable over WhatsApp or calls. She never got irritated or annoyed with my doubts, she happily explained each and everything.

Overall, it was a great experience visiting her and I'm happy about it.
