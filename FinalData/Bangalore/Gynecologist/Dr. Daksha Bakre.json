Then she suggested only life style changes like exercise and diet control.\nAfter few months my periods became regular and thyroid was under control, then I conceived naturally twice but miscarriage happened both the times. \nThen my real struggle started with healthy conception and in this phase Daksha ma'm really helped me a lot to overcome all the emotional stress and she helped me to understand the reasons for miscarriage and then she started with very basic fertility treatments like ovulation induction, IUI, follicular growth study. After 4 months of basic fertility treatment I was able to conceive naturally and was able to deliver a healthy baby via natural vaginal delivery.. :)\nI wrote this much lengthy review just to make anyone understand why they should consult and trust Daksha ma'm. My 3 years journey with Daksha ma'm was really amazing and I thank her for everything. Today I am holding my angel in my arms means, it's all because of Daksha ma'm help and effort.\nI recommend anyone who is trying to find trustworthy gynecologist can reach out to Daksha ma'm without any doubts..",

Then she suggested only life style changes like exercise and diet control.\nAfter few months my periods became regular and thyroid was under control, then I conceived naturally twice but miscarriage happened both the times. \nThen my real struggle started with healthy conception and in this phase Daksha ma'm really helped me a lot to overcome all the emotional stress and she helped me to understand the reasons for miscarriage and then she started with very basic fertility treatments like ovulation induction, IUI, follicular growth study. After 4 months of basic fertility treatment I was able to conceive naturally and was able to deliver a healthy baby via natural vaginal delivery.. :)\nI wrote this much lengthy review just to make anyone understand why they should consult and trust Daksha ma'm. My 3 years journey with Daksha ma'm was really amazing and I thank her for everything. Today I am holding my angel in my arms means, it's all because of Daksha ma'm help and effort.\nI recommend anyone who is trying to find trustworthy gynecologist can reach out to Daksha ma'm without any doubts..",

When I spoke to the receptionist she said it's because she is a regular patient and lied that she had a earlier appointment. I finally left the clinic without visiting the doctor. not sure if this was because I booked through practo. would have appreciated if they had the courtesy to respect patients time and inform in advance about the delay",

I visited multiple doctors and searched so much about the issue, there is not much awareness about this. I went through complete mental ordeal, lot of gynacs suggested that I need to consult therapist , sexologist etc, i tried doing everything but with no success. Then I came across Dr Daksha post reading reviews on Practo, calling her an angel is like an understatement. What she did was nothing less than a miracle. She gave me complete time and focus and taught me how to do dilator training, she helped me with the whole insertion process. I was in her clinic for about an hour, she patiently taught me and made me practice there itself. Within a week, I was able to insert the largest dilator. I just can't thank her enough for saving me. Dr Daksha please let me know if I can be of any help to you, would be willing to do whatever I can. I don't think I can express the impact of what you did, thank you so much for helping me!!",

She called us for follow up consultation with the test reports. We went on 18th Nov. Within 5 days we were charged another 300 rupees. I don't think a patient should be charged again or within 7 days considering the fact that doctor herself asked us to come for follow up.  Request the doctor to look into this for all her patients.",

After meeting Dr.daksha, she treated so well. my mother has to go under two scans before biopsy after that only we can treat further, after checking the report, Dr. informed we don't require any biopsy or further treatment. This news was very relaxing. my mother is good now without any biopsy done which she told is unnecessary and doesn't need any medicines or extra treatment, and gave few suggestions which she has to follow. very much happy with her treatment. I highly recommend Dr.Daksha.",
