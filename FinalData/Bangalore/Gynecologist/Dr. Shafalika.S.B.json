I am truly grateful for her outstanding care and would highly recommend such a compassionate and highly skilled Advanced Laproscopic surgeon.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Shafalika SB is one of the kindest and most empathetic doctors I have ever come across (and coming from a family of doctors, that says a lot!). She is an expert in laparoscopic gynaecological surgeries and her skill and competence ensures successful minimally invasive surgery resulting in greatly reduced recovery timelines.  \n\nI first start consulting Dr Shafalika at Manipal (then Columbia Asia), Yeshwanthpur in 2019. I had heavy and painful periods + gastro problems triggered by periods. The scan confirmed the presence of multiple fibroids as well as adenomyosis (thick uterine lining). \n\nAlthough Dr Shafalika is a surgeon, she will never advise surgery as the first course of treatment and only when absolutely necessary. Dr.  told me I will eventually have to be operated but did not want to operate then. She broke the news to me with extreme kindness and compassion and put me on oral medications to try and suppress symptoms. The oral meds worked for some time but after a few months, I started getting severe migraines. I had moved to the other end of Bangalore by then and did not meet the doctor for my follow up appointment which was due in Feb 2020 due to work related travel. After that, the pandemic started and my visit was delayed greatly (due to my over-indexation on Covid).\n\nI went back to meet the doctor after getting severe period cramps and gastritis in Jan, 2022. Again, she answered all my queries with patience and grace and did not rush me towards surgery although we both knew that was inevitable. When I was mentally ready, I went back and got my surgery done by her in June 2022. She ensured I was comfortable and as I didn\u2019t have insurance, she did her best to reduce the cost of the procedure. It was a complex surgery but Dr. Shafalika was very confident that she would be able to handle it laparoscopically (and she did)!\n\nOn the day of the procedure, she arrived early and held my hand throughout the administration of general anaesthesia. She also reassured me wrt to the queries and concerns I had. During surgery, it was determined that I also had a bad case of endometriosis. At the hands of a lesser skilled surgeon, there was every possibility that my surgery would shift to an \u201copen\u201d one. But Dr. Shafalika managed to conduct the same laparoscopically.  \n\nWhile at the hospital, I saw how well respected she was among her colleagues at Manipal (and deservedly so). She even came to meet me on a Sunday, the day after my operation!\n\nMy post-surgical follow up with the doctor has been equally pleasant and efficient. In the follow up meeting, she again spent a fair amount of time with me and addressed all my queries. There is always a long queue of patients outside her office (some from out of town), but she never rushes you. It is easy for a doctor to become clinical as this is routine work for them, but Dr. Shafalika knows that while she has many patients; for the patient, she is the only doctor! \uf04a\n\nI developed a UTI infection post surgery and the doctor has been helping me address that very efficiently through telephonic consultation via her assistant, Nimisha. Nimisha is also a very kind and helpful person and enables access to Dr. Shafalika as needed. This is super helpful as I live 2.5 hours away.\n\nI have been so impressed with Dr. Shafalika\u2019s work ethic as well as care and concern for her patients, that I have recommended her to my neighbour who is evaluating similar surgery. \n\nI no longer have to plan my life around my menstrual cycle. And am so glad I met Dr. Shafalika and got the procedure done in her able hands and care. Thank you doctor! You are a beacon of compassion and competence \u2013 a very rare combination indeed. \n",

                "review_text": "#longreviewalertI was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriotic cyst in my left ovary along with adenomyosis in the uterus about 3 years ago. Started off with medication that didn\u2019t help at all. I had severe Dysmenorrhea and would take 5-6 pain killers per menstrual cycle. I tried to get pregnant but that didn\u2019t happen too. My symptoms grew worse. It started affecting my daily quality of life. For the next 1 year I kept running from doctor to doctor trying to get a solution to my problem and plan a way for me to get pregnant. After running from pillar to post and after 1 failed laparoscopy surgery by another doctor (owing to the fact that my case was very complicated) I had almost reached a dead end, just then through sheer luck I was referred to Dr. Shafalika SB. I was all the way in abroad back then. That first telephonic call with her changed my very life. Given the fact that I had met so many doctors by then, I had never come across a doctor like her ever before. The way she spoke to me over the call, calmed me down like a mother would and empathized and acknowledged the suffering that I was going through was enough to take half of my anxiety away. The confidence that she spoke with, clearly explained me all the details and the steps ahead; She had a clear plan of treatment for me. Whilst I was abroad, whatever doubts I had she would patiently reply to them over whatsapp (despite having such a hectic schedule). She is an incredible person besides being a highly experienced doctor!The surgery was scheduled in April. I had too many apprehensions in my mind due to a failed laparoscopy surgery that I had undergone a few months ago (in abroad). After meeting Dr. Shafalika in person, she clearly took me through the entire condition once again, clearly explained the steps of the procedure and told me the possible outcomes of the procedure. My surgery was extremely complicated one as I had a frozen pelvis (the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, rectum were all plastered to the uterus, the adenomyosis had spread to the entire uterus, the uterus had reached 20 weeks size). It was going to be a challenge and highly risky to separate the organs from one another and then remove the cysts. I was well informed about everything. With a doctor with such a foresight and confidence, I took the leap of faith. Inside the OT, as soon as I saw her, my anxiety disappeared. She held my hand, smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m there with you. I\u2019ll try my best\u201d. And with that I drifted into a sweet sleep.They say prayers have immense strength in them. 4 hours later, Dr. Shafalika came out victorious, smiling and in content with the success of the surgery. She was literally god sent! What seemed highly risky and complicated in the beginning was a success now. Dr. Shafalika was able to successfully remove the endometriotic cyst along with the adenomyosis despite the various complications. Having such experience and expertise, you can close your eyes and trust her. Here I am, writing this review because I want every woman out there like me to be able to get help. I shall forever be indebted to her.Dr. Shafalika SB is a gem of a person, highly experienced gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon specializing in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery and one of the best doctors that I have ever come across.

The uterus was stuck to the bladder, stomach and other areas, it was a very complicated surgery. But thanks to Dr Shafalika expertise she did a great job.

I am extremely happy with the way she answered all my questions during the process and gave me genuine advice and precautions for what to expect before and after the surgery and how to plan the baby after the surgery. I would highly recommend her to anyone planning a fibroid removal. She is an expert and also has a very calm vibe that will relax you completely during the entire process of surgery. ",

From the moment I walked into her office, I felt reassured by her warm demeanor and genuine concern for my well-being.\n\nDr. Shafalika 's expertise in the field is undeniable. Not only did she flawlessly perform the hysteroscopic polypectomy, but she also took the time to explain each and every step of the procedure in a way that was easily understandable. Her ability to break down complex medical terms into simple explanations put my mind at ease and allowed me to feel more informed and confident in the process.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Shafalika apart is her empathetic approach to patient care. She understood my concerns and fears, and she went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable throughout the entire procedure. Her patience in addressing my questions and her willingness to listen to my anxieties made a significant difference in how I perceived the entire experience.\n\nDuring the procedure, Dr. Shafalika 's bedside manner was exceptional. She maintained open communication, letting me know what was happening at every moment. This not only helped me stay calm but also created a sense of trust that I had rarely felt in a medical setting before.\n\nAfter the procedure, Dr. Shafalika took the time to discuss the results with me and to provide post-operative care instructions. Her dedication to my recovery and her willingness to follow up in the days that followed truly demonstrated her commitment to her patients' well-being.\n\nIn a field where compassion and expertise often go hand in hand, Dr. Shafalika stands out as a shining example. Her ability to combine medical skill with genuine care and understanding is a rarity that should be celebrated. I wholeheartedly recommend  Dr. Shafalika to anyone in need of an empathetic and expert obstetrician-gynecologist. She has not only provided me with exceptional medical care but has also left a lasting positive impact on my overall well-being. \n\nFurthermore, her assistant Miss.Suma was very helpful throughout the whole journey. I would highly recommend Dr.Shafalika for surgeries like Hysteroscopic Polypectomy.\n",

I patiently waited to get her appointment and I knew she is the one whom I need to meet and after meeting I realized its the truth and the search ended. why? doctor has the knowledge,  clarity of the issue, identify the issue. quickly explained all my questions I had for years through drawings, through the model she had in her desk, clearing all the questions. she was to the point giving a strong solution, not thinking twice to handle the tough fibroids of 20  cms that i was holding not knowing how to get rid of it. none of the doctors of any hospital had this expertise except that they were scared nor showing the confidence. but Dr Shafalika, said she will handle my case, showing the simplest procedure that she chose for me amongst all of thats available. she asked me to admit one the day, early morning of my surgery, 8am surgery, and she gave confidence before surgery, during surgery kept talking to me. she dint give a general anesthesia but local to that place where she was operating. she was very kind, very approachable, very sensitive to ur feelings, gave respect to ur feelings and adviced well. she completed the surgery successfully and its 9 months now and 2 scans post surgery, im clear of fibroids. also she said I can leave the hospital the next day of my surgery though it was a mini laproptomy (small open surgery). the nurses, helpers in manipal yeshwantpur hospital was excellent. doctors assistants were excellent. she gave me complete female team for my surgery and no men was allowed. they simply amazed this journey and I never could believe that I underwent a surgery. it flew like a feather and she made it feel like a breeze. Allaah blessed me to meet her and she made the work of surgery like a breeze. how many doctors I met before only had increased in trauma but Dr Shafalika is the best!!!! I never intend to meet any other gynae except her. she is the gem!! thank you doctor Shafalika. its not just the surgery but her knowledge,  expertise,  she says don't come to hospital. stay home. making things simpler. even if others complicate during scan, she is there to back u up. Simplest Shafalika and the knowledgeable. I suggest doctor shafalika. ",

Dr. shafalika has done an absolutely wonderful job of cleaning the whole thing properly so i don't have any future issues.\nMy husband and family members are ever grateful for giving me this new healthy life.\nThe surgery was very complicated but she stood her ground and did everything that was good for me.\nI thank her and all the hospital staff for taking care of me, this includes the customer service team (Aisha and team), the team involved in my surgery, Dr Dayanand the radiologist who has been studying my case for years now,  the nurses who assisted with pre operation tests and the staff who took care of me operation - please note i would be ever grateful for the rest of my life.\nI will highly recommend Dr. Shafalika like i have done previously.\nThank you from the bottom of my heart, i can't express myself how much you have done for me ",

I am truly grateful for her outstanding care and would highly recommend such a compassionate and highly skilled Advanced Laproscopic surgeon.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Shafalika SB is one of the kindest and most empathetic doctors I have ever come across (and coming from a family of doctors, that says a lot!). She is an expert in laparoscopic gynaecological surgeries and her skill and competence ensures successful minimally invasive surgery resulting in greatly reduced recovery timelines.  \n\nI first start consulting Dr Shafalika at Manipal (then Columbia Asia), Yeshwanthpur in 2019. I had heavy and painful periods + gastro problems triggered by periods. The scan confirmed the presence of multiple fibroids as well as adenomyosis (thick uterine lining). \n\nAlthough Dr Shafalika is a surgeon, she will never advise surgery as the first course of treatment and only when absolutely necessary. Dr.  told me I will eventually have to be operated but did not want to operate then. She broke the news to me with extreme kindness and compassion and put me on oral medications to try and suppress symptoms. The oral meds worked for some time but after a few months, I started getting severe migraines. I had moved to the other end of Bangalore by then and did not meet the doctor for my follow up appointment which was due in Feb 2020 due to work related travel. After that, the pandemic started and my visit was delayed greatly (due to my over-indexation on Covid).\n\nI went back to meet the doctor after getting severe period cramps and gastritis in Jan, 2022. Again, she answered all my queries with patience and grace and did not rush me towards surgery although we both knew that was inevitable. When I was mentally ready, I went back and got my surgery done by her in June 2022. She ensured I was comfortable and as I didn\u2019t have insurance, she did her best to reduce the cost of the procedure. It was a complex surgery but Dr. Shafalika was very confident that she would be able to handle it laparoscopically (and she did)!\n\nOn the day of the procedure, she arrived early and held my hand throughout the administration of general anaesthesia. She also reassured me wrt to the queries and concerns I had. During surgery, it was determined that I also had a bad case of endometriosis. At the hands of a lesser skilled surgeon, there was every possibility that my surgery would shift to an \u201copen\u201d one. But Dr. Shafalika managed to conduct the same laparoscopically.  \n\nWhile at the hospital, I saw how well respected she was among her colleagues at Manipal (and deservedly so). She even came to meet me on a Sunday, the day after my operation!\n\nMy post-surgical follow up with the doctor has been equally pleasant and efficient. In the follow up meeting, she again spent a fair amount of time with me and addressed all my queries. There is always a long queue of patients outside her office (some from out of town), but she never rushes you. It is easy for a doctor to become clinical as this is routine work for them, but Dr. Shafalika knows that while she has many patients; for the patient, she is the only doctor! \uf04a\n\nI developed a UTI infection post surgery and the doctor has been helping me address that very efficiently through telephonic consultation via her assistant, Nimisha. Nimisha is also a very kind and helpful person and enables access to Dr. Shafalika as needed. This is super helpful as I live 2.5 hours away.\n\nI have been so impressed with Dr. Shafalika\u2019s work ethic as well as care and concern for her patients, that I have recommended her to my neighbour who is evaluating similar surgery. \n\nI no longer have to plan my life around my menstrual cycle. And am so glad I met Dr. Shafalika and got the procedure done in her able hands and care. Thank you doctor! You are a beacon of compassion and competence \u2013 a very rare combination indeed. \n",

                "review_text": "#longreviewalertI was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriotic cyst in my left ovary along with adenomyosis in the uterus about 3 years ago. Started off with medication that didn\u2019t help at all. I had severe Dysmenorrhea and would take 5-6 pain killers per menstrual cycle. I tried to get pregnant but that didn\u2019t happen too. My symptoms grew worse. It started affecting my daily quality of life. For the next 1 year I kept running from doctor to doctor trying to get a solution to my problem and plan a way for me to get pregnant. After running from pillar to post and after 1 failed laparoscopy surgery by another doctor (owing to the fact that my case was very complicated) I had almost reached a dead end, just then through sheer luck I was referred to Dr. Shafalika SB. I was all the way in abroad back then. That first telephonic call with her changed my very life. Given the fact that I had met so many doctors by then, I had never come across a doctor like her ever before. The way she spoke to me over the call, calmed me down like a mother would and empathized and acknowledged the suffering that I was going through was enough to take half of my anxiety away. The confidence that she spoke with, clearly explained me all the details and the steps ahead; She had a clear plan of treatment for me. Whilst I was abroad, whatever doubts I had she would patiently reply to them over whatsapp (despite having such a hectic schedule). She is an incredible person besides being a highly experienced doctor!The surgery was scheduled in April. I had too many apprehensions in my mind due to a failed laparoscopy surgery that I had undergone a few months ago (in abroad). After meeting Dr. Shafalika in person, she clearly took me through the entire condition once again, clearly explained the steps of the procedure and told me the possible outcomes of the procedure. My surgery was extremely complicated one as I had a frozen pelvis (the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, rectum were all plastered to the uterus, the adenomyosis had spread to the entire uterus, the uterus had reached 20 weeks size). It was going to be a challenge and highly risky to separate the organs from one another and then remove the cysts. I was well informed about everything. With a doctor with such a foresight and confidence, I took the leap of faith. Inside the OT, as soon as I saw her, my anxiety disappeared. She held my hand, smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m there with you. I\u2019ll try my best\u201d. And with that I drifted into a sweet sleep.They say prayers have immense strength in them. 4 hours later, Dr. Shafalika came out victorious, smiling and in content with the success of the surgery. She was literally god sent! What seemed highly risky and complicated in the beginning was a success now. Dr. Shafalika was able to successfully remove the endometriotic cyst along with the adenomyosis despite the various complications. Having such experience and expertise, you can close your eyes and trust her. Here I am, writing this review because I want every woman out there like me to be able to get help. I shall forever be indebted to her.Dr. Shafalika SB is a gem of a person, highly experienced gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon specializing in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery and one of the best doctors that I have ever come across. I would highly recommend her to everyone. ",

She asked me to try other options and I finally requested doctor for surgery. The day of surgery along with hysterectomy, doctor performed ovarian cystectomy, adenomyoma exicison as well. The uterus was stuck to the bladder, stomach and other areas, it was a very complicated surgery. But thanks to Dr Shafalika expertise she did a great job. I would highly recommend her for gynaecological problems. She is a empathetic, calm and highly professional. She treats her patients like friends, she instills  hope and confidence in her patients. She is truly God sent. ",

I am extremely happy with the way she answered all my questions during the process and gave me genuine advice and precautions for what to expect before and after the surgery and how to plan the baby after the surgery. I would highly recommend her to anyone planning a fibroid removal. She is an expert and also has a very calm vibe that will relax you completely during the entire process of surgery. ",

From the moment I walked into her office, I felt reassured by her warm demeanor and genuine concern for my well-being.\n\nDr. Shafalika 's expertise in the field is undeniable. Not only did she flawlessly perform the hysteroscopic polypectomy, but she also took the time to explain each and every step of the procedure in a way that was easily understandable. Her ability to break down complex medical terms into simple explanations put my mind at ease and allowed me to feel more informed and confident in the process.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Shafalika apart is her empathetic approach to patient care. She understood my concerns and fears, and she went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable throughout the entire procedure. Her patience in addressing my questions and her willingness to listen to my anxieties made a significant difference in how I perceived the entire experience.\n\nDuring the procedure, Dr. Shafalika 's bedside manner was exceptional. She maintained open communication, letting me know what was happening at every moment. This not only helped me stay calm but also created a sense of trust that I had rarely felt in a medical setting before.\n\nAfter the procedure, Dr. Shafalika took the time to discuss the results with me and to provide post-operative care instructions. Her dedication to my recovery and her willingness to follow up in the days that followed truly demonstrated her commitment to her patients' well-being.\n\nIn a field where compassion and expertise often go hand in hand, Dr. Shafalika stands out as a shining example. Her ability to combine medical skill with genuine care and understanding is a rarity that should be celebrated. I wholeheartedly recommend  Dr. Shafalika to anyone in need of an empathetic and expert obstetrician-gynecologist. She has not only provided me with exceptional medical care but has also left a lasting positive impact on my overall well-being. \n\nFurthermore, her assistant Miss.Suma was very helpful throughout the whole journey. I would highly recommend Dr.Shafalika for surgeries like Hysteroscopic Polypectomy.\n",

I patiently waited to get her appointment and I knew she is the one whom I need to meet and after meeting I realized its the truth and the search ended. why? doctor has the knowledge,  clarity of the issue, identify the issue. quickly explained all my questions I had for years through drawings, through the model she had in her desk, clearing all the questions. she was to the point giving a strong solution, not thinking twice to handle the tough fibroids of 20  cms that i was holding not knowing how to get rid of it. none of the doctors of any hospital had this expertise except that they were scared nor showing the confidence. but Dr Shafalika, said she will handle my case, showing the simplest procedure that she chose for me amongst all of thats available. she asked me to admit one the day, early morning of my surgery, 8am surgery, and she gave confidence before surgery, during surgery kept talking to me. she dint give a general anesthesia but local to that place where she was operating. she was very kind, very approachable, very sensitive to ur feelings, gave respect to ur feelings and adviced well. she completed the surgery successfully and its 9 months now and 2 scans post surgery, im clear of fibroids. also she said I can leave the hospital the next day of my surgery though it was a mini laproptomy (small open surgery). the nurses, helpers in manipal yeshwantpur hospital was excellent. doctors assistants were excellent. she gave me complete female team for my surgery and no men was allowed. they simply amazed this journey and I never could believe that I underwent a surgery. it flew like a feather and she made it feel like a breeze. Allaah blessed me to meet her and she made the work of surgery like a breeze. how many doctors I met before only had increased in trauma but Dr Shafalika is the best!!!! I never intend to meet any other gynae except her. she is the gem!! thank you doctor Shafalika. its not just the surgery but her knowledge,  expertise,  she says don't come to hospital. stay home. making things simpler. even if others complicate during scan, she is there to back u up. Simplest Shafalika and the knowledgeable. I suggest doctor shafalika. ",

Dr. shafalika has done an absolutely wonderful job of cleaning the whole thing properly so i don't have any future issues.\nMy husband and family members are ever grateful for giving me this new healthy life.\nThe surgery was very complicated but she stood her ground and did everything that was good for me.\nI thank her and all the hospital staff for taking care of me, this includes the customer service team (Aisha and team), the team involved in my surgery, Dr Dayanand the radiologist who has been studying my case for years now,  the nurses who assisted with pre operation tests and the staff who took care of me operation - please note i would be ever grateful for the rest of my life.\nI will highly recommend Dr. Shafalika like i have done previously.\nThank you from the bottom of my heart, i can't express myself how much you have done for me ",

Before going to Dr. Shefalika, I had gone through her profile, reviews and everything I could get on internet and I must say I was impressed.When we visited her, what we found was an absolutely amazing human being. She was very empathetic, kind, patient and detail oriented in her approach. She explained all the options in detail and discussed each report. I asked her all the questions that I had in mind, she was answering them in detailed way and was encouraging me to understand more. We then decided to go ahead with the surgery with Dr. Shefalika.Coming to the surgery, the surgery went nicely. Post the surgery doctor updated me on the completion and also showed me the Uterus and the ovaries which were removed and briefly explained the complications that we there in those organs. The best part was the quick recovery. My mom could walk on the same day of surgery and she was discharged the very next day at noon. And everyone at home was surprised to see her walk freely. She in fact was doing the basic house chores on the very best day of the surgery. The doctor had instilled very high confidence in her that she felt she had already recovered fully.Finally, I'm sure many laproscopic surgeons might perform similar surgeries. But the confidence that Dr. Shefalika instilled in my mom (who is very fearful and easily gets tensed) was unbelievable. We stay in Whitefield but got the surgery done in Yeshwanthpur, only because we could get it done by Dr. Shefalika, such was the confidence that my mom had in her.I really recommend her for any gynaec issues, especially for gynaec surgeries. Thank you doctor!",

I feel great pleasure in writing this .....Dr. Shafalika mam is an  incredible doctor with her down to earth personality along with her great expertise on laparoscopic surgery. She treats the patient as a family member n gives best moral support n positive thoughts which itself  heals half of the worries a patient has. It was a complicated case, the patient had undergone  open surgery after  diagnosing with uterine fibroid a year ago. Unfortunately, the operation  was unsuccefull, because of the diffused nature and growth of the fibroid in to the uterine cavity. We contacted many  doctors but none of them were confident in handling this case for the successfull operation, and many were suggesting for one more open surgery because of the nature of the fibroid, we were quite worried and disappointed.  A few days back we were fortunate to come across the name of Dr. Shafalika mam on internet while searching for the experts on laparoscopic surgery. When we met her, she listened to us keenly and took all details of the case history. After examining all the details and the patient, she advised that she will do her best to treat the case to a succefull end. With God's grace and mam's expertise the operation was successful, despite its complicated nature. I sincerely felt Dr. Shafalika mam is an excellent doctor with great expertise and patient friendly attitude. She sinserely treats a patient with minimum expenditure towards the treatment. She goes out of the way in helping the patient in all aspects. One will be really lucky enough to get a doctor of this kind. I hereby, with our experience with Dr Shafalika Mam,  wholeheartedly, recommend any women who are suffering from fibroids and related problems to consult Dr. Shafalika *** *** **** ********* *** *************",

We were consulting with a clinic where they doesn't had any advance treatment for cyst. So I started checking in different websites for the best doc in Bangalore and I found Dr. Shafalika. We took an appointment in Colombia-asia hospital hebbal. She welcomed us with a great smile. Wife explained her problems. Since we trying for a baby from last couple of months, doc suggested us to go for a laptoscopic surgery. But my wife was very scared about surgeries because she never hospitalized before. Shafalika mam gave her alot of confidence and we have done surgery  on 22nd March 2017. She was in hospital for 2 days. After surgery Shafalika has explanied us about the cyst, how it impact her, how it occurs etc. My wife had endometriosis (chocolate cyst) which had 11cm long. Just after 2 days we came back home. After that couple of times we consulted Shafalika Ma'm and she was always been very helpful. Trust me, I never ever seen a doctor like her. * ****** ******* ******* *** ****** *** *** * **** **** ** ** ********* ***** More than a doc, she was like a mother for my wife.  The way she talk, explain things are amazing. She listen all the problems *** **** **** *** **** ********* The best thing with this doctor is, she never recommend too much medicines and suggested us not to take more tablets. I had contacted her almost everyday (through calls or messages) but she never get angry for that, infact she listens the problem even in her busy schedule and responded nicely. In all these years I have seen many doctors in my life. But no one is like Shafalika. *** ** *** *** *** I heard and I read alot of things about endometriosis like, pregnancy can be a challenge with chocolate cyst. With God's grace and Shafalika Ma'm treatment, my wife is 4 months pregnant now.  Seriously I can't explain my happiness.  After googling so much I was thinking of IVF, but nothing was needed. When Shafalika doc is there, nothing to worry. Me and my Family is always been Thankful to her. May God bless Shafalika doc and her family. We really pray for her everyday, Because she gave Life for me and my wife. I would highly recommend Dr. Shafalika to everyone. *** ** *** **** *********** ****** * ************* ** ********** Meet her once, I will bet you, your life will change. ",

Her reply was like \"I may have many patients Rajeshwari,but for my patients,i am the only doctor\"so i do come .She builds trust in patients first,which is very important in any surgery.On the day of surgery,i was full of confidence knowing i am in safe hands.I was put to sleep,my fibroids were removed like magic,and i was able to walk and get discharged by next day.Within next 4-5 days i was able to be on my own.For any one who wants to undergo surgery,don't delay,trust ma'am with your eyes closed.She will never break ur trust.She is an angel afterall :) thank you ma'am for everything from the bottom of my heart and wish you a good health and long life so that many like me get the treatment from you.",

She greeted me with a smiling face and i could immediately feel the positive vibe .Dr.Shefalika is not only a wonderful doctor ...but a wonderful person. She discussed my problem in detail and told me that my fibroid was too big and the uterus had enlarged to 24 months. And at this stage, as i am 54yrs...it was better to go for hysterectomy. I was so nervous about the surgery and i had been postponing the surgery for the past 2 yrs and now it had become too big. She explained to me in detail about the laproscopic hysterectomy. I got so much faith in her....that i got the courage and got the surgery done just 5 days after my visit...on 26.march.2022. I was discharged on 27.march.2022. I did not feel any pain inspite of such big fibroid being removed . ..n now it's a week today...i got my plasters also removed. I absolutely have no pain or any kind of complications. I still can't believe it's over!!!! I am doing all small lil work at home and i could walk the next day itself. My house is in the first floor and the next day after getting discharged from the hospital ...i climbed the stairs and went home\ud83d\ude0aI kindly request all ....those who are still wondering and fearing about hysterectomy or any other issues...to please go and meet Dr.Shefalika once. Next i am sure...you will be writing your successful story here ...for others to read\ud83d\ude0a I am a person who was very nervous of the surgery.....and i had got so much courage after meeting ma'am, that i went smiling into the OT , which surprised my people ...including me \ud83d\ude0a I knew...i was in very safe hands.

Her calm demeanor and compassionate nature instantly put me at ease and I knew I was in good hands.\n\nDoctor took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure and what to expect, which made me feel prepared and confident going into the surgery. She was extremely patient and answered all of my questions with great detail, leaving no stone unturned.\n\nDr. Shafalika is incredibly skilled with the laparoscopic technique to remove the fibroids with minimal incisions. The procedure was successful and I experienced very minimal postoperative discomfort, which was a huge relief.\n\nThroughout the recovery process, she was there to support me every step of the way. She provided me with comprehensive post-op advice and checked in on me to ensure that everything was going smoothly. Her kindness and compassion truly went above and beyond.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Shafalika to anyone in need of gynecological care.

In the first stage itself she convinced me, supported me & told me to come with my earlier scanning , blood reports. I felt very much comfortable & relaxed after talking to her, date was fixed for operation, & everything went on well.\nI was very much impressed by her soft spoken encouraging words. I felt God's presence in her when I was interacting with her. Of course she is a special creation of God.  I am very proud of her for the way she is managing the patients, operations, her family with small children. Hats off to my dear Shafalika mam, may God give her more energy, patience to serve people & & protect her family, I wish her to reach better hieghts\n\n.",

The way she explained the situation, and the way mam treated me is very impressive, and mam explained about the surgery and how it goes, and explained about future. Before i met mam, i wanted to end my life, and felt like with out kidz my life is nothing. Mam gave all hopes, and iam convinced, and fixed date for surgery, Finally the day has come to go for surgery, and i was so balanced with mam words, and mam pampered like mother in operation theater. and its just like a miracle, i dint even know, when surgery was done, i went into a deep sleep, when i woke up, everything was done, and able to walk next day. \n\nSo, my family and i are very thankful to Shafalika mam, and mam is godess for me.

Back in my country, I was informed that the treatment measure would be hysterectomy (removal of my uterus). Being a newly wedded 30years old woman this was very disturbing and impossible to comprehend for both myself and my husband. We then started looking for treatment opportunities abroad and thats when we came across the amazing testimonies written about Dr. Shafalika. We reached out to the Columbia Asia Hospital and booked an appointment with Dr. Shafalika. When I first met her she was very friendly and was talking to me as someone who feels my pain and my fears. She treated me like a mother  throughout my stay in the hospital. She gave me the courage to walk into the OR. I completely felt safe. The Laparoscopic surgery was successful and I had speedy recovery. I'm thankful to have gone to Dr. Shafalika for my treatment and I strongly recommend her for all women with gynecological issues. May God bless her and her family. ",

Doctor gave us confidence and explained whole procedure to us. She gave us time to think and take a decision. My mother doesn't know English or Kannada, but Mrs.Nimisha, doctor's colleague helped with the translation. Both of them are very interactive and friendly people. My mother was very scared before the surgery since many of her friends who underwent the similar surgery took 2-3 months of bed rest to recover. But my mother was able to recover quickly and was on her feet very next day!! Doctor is an expert in minimal invasive surgery and I guess it helped in faster recovery. Dr.Shafalika is like the doctors of past era when it comes to confidence about the procedure and outcome. She doesn't make any diplomatic statements to save herself from any unfavourable outcome.She is like new gen doctors when it comes to interaction with patients. She likes to spend time in explaining the procedure, enquiring about health and all. A rare mix of both qualities. We are extremely thankful to her for making the entire process as peaceful as possible.",

As of now it is 11th day of my surgery and I am able to walk ,climb stairs and perform all the work with out any discomfort.\nDr Shafalika is an expert in laproscopic and minimaly invasive Gynaecology and not only her expertise in the field but her positive news and kindness  helped me to recover fast. I am extremely grateful to Dr Shafalika, words are not enough to thank her for the wonderful skill and kindness. I highly recommend her as a first choice for the treatment of Gynaecological problems.

Trust me whosoever is reading my review, she is Superb doctor. She explained me in details regarding the issue and advised me a surgery as my fibroid was big enough (10 CM) and weighs around 350 gm when it was sent for Biopsy. She did my surgery on 16 July 2020 in Columbia Asia Yeswanthpur. She is one of the Doctor on whom i can rely for any Gynaecology issue. It was a  laproscopic surgery and trust me i knew how it would be because doctor explained me even the tiny detail however i was so scared. But the doctor made me and even my husband so comfortable that we went ahead and today after 10 days. i am writing this review. I am all fit and fine now and even started with little household chores. If anyone of you facing any related issue, please visit her once and you will not be disappointed.\n\nThank you so Much Dr. Shafalika SB\n\nRicha Varun Malik  ",

I was very nervous due to this as I am still young and yet to conceive a child. Three of the experienced gynaecologist which I consulted at different hospitals suggested to go with conventional method of myomectomy which is the only way to deal with such large fibroids and without the surgery, it's impossible to conceive as there was hardly any space left for a baby in the uterus. We consulted to Dr Shafalika after watching a video of her speaking about uterine fibroids and it's treatment through laparoscopic way. She is very much caring and affectionate like a mother. She assured me while holding my hand to be completely fine after thoroughly explaining the case. We went ahead with a laparoscopic myomectomy and 3 larger fibroids weighed around 1.9kg got removed. I stayed in hospital for only 2 days and after 1 week of surgery, I was doing all my normal work. Thanks to Dr Shafalika ma'm for her kindness and deft in minimally invasive surgery. May God bless her. ",

Being a typical Indian mother she did not care much and opted for homeopathy treatment for almost an year. But seeing her condition I was not much satisfied and due to such heavy bleeding her hb levels kept dropping. After my research on Practo I considered of visiting Dr. Shafalika, after series of consultations and necessary scans we decided to go ahead with hysterectomy. One of the quality of Dr which I feel is found rarely these days is that she never forced upon or scared us with the process, treatment, consequences etc. She has been the most friendly and understanding doctor ever. Her kind words and warmth in her presence will surely make you feel that the patient is in the safest hands. A wonderful job done by Doctor, when asked my mother said 'I don't even feel that I underwent a surgery' such was the process of surgery and speedy recovery. I am thankful to Dr Shafalika for being so considerate towards her patients and their family members. You truly are a blessing as a doctor. I would say you can blindly go to doctor shafalika for gynae issues and certainly you will receive the best results. ",

After consulting several doctors without any solution finally took her to Dr.Shafalika, as one of my colleague recommended her.  Doctor gave valuable suggestions on the problems faced by wife.  She clearly explained what are the problems associated with Uterine fibroids and the types of surgeries that exist to remove them.  The way she handled the patients is really commendable,  she is very soft spoken and very friendly with her patients.  As my wife was very weak and anaemic due to heavy loss of blood the Doctor gave medication to gain blood and after few months decided to remove the fibroids through Laparoscopic myomectomy.  Even after the surgery the care shown by the Dr.Shafalika needs to be commended. Now my wife is doing alright. We are really satisfied by her treatment.  Thanks a lot to Dr.Shafalika.  I highly recommend any other patients suffering with Uterine fibroids to consult Dr.Shafalika at Columbia Asia Hospitals, Yeshwanthpura, Bengaluru.",

We discussed the treatment plan and I had my surgery on June 12th. It was a complicated surgery as the cysts were very huge. But doctor handled it with much extra care and preserved my ovaries. The anthesist is also extremely friendly and she noted down all my concerns and made sure the surgery went smooth. I  felt my life has shattered and i wouldn't be able to lead a normal life but Doctor Shafalika has changed my perception now. I have new hopes on my life going forward. I m really blessed to be treated  y her. She is an other mother. I was almost induced before surgery doctor came to me and she held my cheeks and said to me she is going to start the surgery and she said everything is gonna be fine post surgery. I was put to deep sleep in seconds. The surgery went well and I m recovering well now. She is the real angel on earth. You don't need anyone else when you have Doctor shafalika. I would recommend her to everyone.  Her smile makes things fall in the place... :)",

First of all she has a lot of patience to listen what I had to say. It made me feel very comfortable to be open enough (Comfortness you get when you talk to person you know from many years) and shared my health issues.Post understanding my situation she explained in detail on what has to be done to over come the issue i had. End of the day its my call to decide on the options Dr Shafalika suggested. With positive hopes on her i decided to under go laparoscopic myomectomy and she dint let my hopes go down.Surgery went on very well and I had very minimal pain post surgery. On her every visits to the ward she encouraged me and that made me feel confident that i am all fine now. She treats you like more of a friend/well wisher than a patient. Dr Shafalika was available every time when i reached her for any questions. Her positive approach towards her profession has helped me a lot. I would strongly recommend Dr. Shafalika to my family/friends.",

From the initial consultation to the post-operative follow-up, she took the time to thoroughly explain the surgery to both my mother and myself, alleviating any concerns we may have had.The surgery itself was a success, and my mother's recovery has been smooth and speedy.Aside from her exceptional medical abilities, Dr. Shafalika mam is also a very kind and soft-spoken person. She made my mother feel comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process. Her caring nature was greatly appreciated and added to the overall positive experience.I would highly recommend Dr. Shafalika mam to anyone in need of laparoscopic surgery. She is a highly skilled and compassionate doctor who truly cares for her patients. Thank you, Dr. Shafalika mam, for everything you have done for my mother and our family.",

                "review_text": "I visited Dr Shafalika a few months ago, as I had sharp, unexplained pains in my abdomen. After checking my ultrasound, she found that I had a large ovarian cyst. She explained that the size of the cyst could be causing ovarian torsion and that might explain the pain I was experiencing. She recommended exercise and dietary changes in order to manage the pain, and prescribed a painkiller in case the pain was unbearable. She advised me to monitor the situation for some time, and if the pain did not improve or the cyst grew, she would surgically remove the cyst.\n\nThe doctor was very patient and kind during the whole process. I appreciated that she explained the health issue in both medical terms and layperson's terms to ensure that I understood what was going on. She was also very receptive to questions that I had.\n\nA couple of weeks after the initial visit, the pain from the cyst was preventing me from going to work, so I visited Dr Shafalika again and we scheduled a laparoscopic cyst removal. I was very nervous before the surgery, as I have not had surgery aside from this procedure. Dr Shafalika's confidence in her ability and reassurance helped me calm my nerves and feel prepared for the cyst removal. She was with me and my family through the whole process, including  getting a room assignment after the surgery for me to recover overnight.\n\nThe surgery was performed without complications, despite the fact that a second large cyst that did not show up on the ultrasound also had to be removed. My incisions from the laparoscopic surgery are also healing nicely, and Dr Shafalika ensured that personally in a checkup appointment after the surgery. She was also able to give me lifestyle related advice to help prevent more cysts from forming in the future.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr Shafalika to anyone who requires a high quality gynaecologist.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Shafalika performed abdominal hysterectomy for me ten days back to get rid of my huge fibroids. Myomectomy was not possible due to the size of the fibroids. I had fibroids for quite some time, but they were mostly asymptomatic, which made me believe that I could just live with them and prevent them from growing further by adopting proper diet and exercise along with natural remedies. In retrospect, this was a great mistake! The doctor whom I had consulted two years back (following a routine health check-up) had advised immediate hysterectomy but did not explain the consequences of leaving them untreated.  Though the fibroids were asymptomatic, in two years they had increased in size to obstruct the ureters and prevent complete draining of urine from the kidneys posing risk to kidneys (which was revealed in a routine health check-up again). \n\nGetting back to the procedure performed by Dr. Shafalika, I completely concur with all the good words and praise showered upon her by fellow patients. She is very friendly and a very good communicator. She took me into complete confidence and promised recovery sufficient to resume routine work within ten days. I would go to the extent of saying that she over-delivers on her promises!! I was discharged from the hospital the day after the surgery, raising eyebrows of everyone around me. My recovery has been phenomenal and I'm all set to get back to work tomorrow.  The only restriction is on lifting weights heavier than 6 kg for 6 weeks. The doctor adopts minimally invasive techniques even in abdominal surgery that render such results. If only I had consulted her two years back, I probably could have saved my uterus (but I understand there is the risk of fibroids growing back). \n\nMy suggestion to other patients: Do not neglect your fibroids. Take the effort to seek doctors specializing in minimally invasive treatment. ",

I had a huge multiple fibroids measuring about 15cms and weighing about 1050gms which Dr.Shafalika was successfully able to remove it through Laproscopic surgery which I underwent recently. We are very thankful to dr.Shafalika and dr Savitha your guidance, patience and positive nature made it easy for me to undergo this surgery and recovering nicely.

Her patience in answering even the silliest of doubts is commendable. Her ever smiling face, positive attitude and belief in \"less is more\" when it comes to medications is noteworthy. She promises the outcome and delivers on her promises. Our world can make do with many more Dr.Shafalikas and I would definitely recommend her to anyone with gynec issues. Thanks to my neighbor who recommended her to me, now i have a gynec for life :-)",

She believes in ensuring her patients get the best treatment and a fast recovery, she encouraged my mother to be back on her feet just the day after surgery, my mother felt safe in her care and is recovering well. We are so grateful to Dr Shafalika. Her compassion shines through she is definitely an inspiration to all those who have a chance to meet her. May she continue her great work for many many years to come and touch many more lives like she has ours ",

It was going to take an agonising times if open surgery was done\n\nDr Shafalika after examining my case fully reassured us on possibility of laparoscopic surgery suggested us to go for it\n\nShe did a fantastic job in successfully performing the hysterectomy using laparoscopic means handling all adhesions perfectly.  I was discharged from hospital next day . Shr saved me  longer traumatic experience of open surgery and i was back to work very quickly\n\nI feel she is one of the best hands on conducting complicated surgeries of such nature . \n\nHer temparament, subject knowledge  and way of explanation to patients is remarkable.",

I consulted doctor in my office for a second opinion and she referred me to Dr. Shafalika. Dr. Shafalika has all the qualities that an ideal doctor should have. She is friendly and explained me about the issue, assured me that there is nothing to worry about and gave me confidence to deal with the entire process. She listened to me patiently whenever I had questions. One can trust Dr. Shafalika without any apprehensions. I got laparoscopic cystectomy done one week back and I am almost fully recovered now. Many thanks to Dr. Shafalika. ",

I visited madam and after good discussions and examination, I got myomectomy done, that is just removing only fibroids in my uterus.\n\nMy experience with madam was very good. She is down to earth, treats patients as family member, gives lots of moral support, confidence, always smiling, lot of patience along with good experience in laparoscopic procedures. \n\nAn excellent doctor and I strongly recommend for OBG problems.  \n\n",

I found her to be very genuine and caring. She was always accessible over the phone during the course of my treatment. She even made casual visits to my room before the surgery to ensure I was in good spirits. She was very clear that she would personally take care of the surgery end to end, including pre and post surgery stuff (sewtures, etc). Her confidence to handle the case was infectious. \n\nMy gynecologist had given my this advice - In case of fibroids, when not-so-experienced surgeons work on you, only to find a tumor bigger than they expected, they might convert your lap mymectomy to an abdominal mymectomy as they might be more comfortable with that procedure. That would change your recovery period from 10 days to 2 months, not to mention that scarring and other costs or risks. I could not afford a 2 month break from work. I had to find an expert. And Im lucky I found Dr. Shafalika.\n\nMy fibroid was 12 cm on the day of surgery. It was a successful laparoscopic mymectomy. Today was my post op final check up and Im cleared to do whatever I want including lifting weights. If you or your loved one is looking at a fibroid surgery, Id highly recommend Dr. Shafalika. I wish more doctors were like her.",

It\u2019s because of her that I am leading a normal pain free life today. Just can\u2019t thank her enough.  I was diagnosed with endometriosis and multiple sub mural fibroids which were causing excruciating pain and excessive bleeding.  I also got to know that I have a frozen pelvis (a condition where other organs like bowel system and intestines get attached to the uterus).  I was informed that there is high risk of my other organs getting damaged during the surgery. I was extremely anxious thinking about all these complications.  \nInfact, I had consulted other doctors before meeting Dr.Shafalika and they advised me to undergo hysterectomy which I was not comfortable with. Despite of all these complications not even once Dr. Shafalika mentioned that my uterus needs to be removed. All along the way she convinced me that everything will be fine.  My surgery was successful and I recovered within a week. She\u2019s a very patient and a warm person and goes out of the way to comfort her patients.  \n",

In this age of commercialization, it is not very often that one comes across a doctor of such high reputation to not just try her best to keep the patient's` interest in mind but also act as a source of strength for the patient's family when the times are tough. Her approach to me has been very heartening and she gave my family the confidence and trust that it will all be fine. She gave utmost personal attention - whether it was to make sure she talks to me and tells me to say a prayer just before administering anesthesia or to tell my parents that all will be well. *** ** **** **** ******* *** did something other doctors would have probably given up on. Her advice was in my best interest. What I also admire about her is that despite being in such a busy profession, she is also approachable and I can without hesitation, ping or call her when I need her advice and she will help without any hassles or hesitation. I strongly recommend her and wish her the very best! ",

Among all the Gynaes I have interacted with, she is the one who has cleared all my doubts, even the silliest ones and she explained very neatly with what are the other options that I had and what are the pros and cons of it. I took the final call and I have no regrets about it. Throughout being her patient, she never made me feel like a patient rather it was like a mother- daughter conversation that we had, she made me so comfortable. Since being very young though going through lot of pain and agony, I was still not ready to give up my Uterus. After talking to Dr Shefalika, I was confident to undergo the surgery, that\u2019s how good she is. I underwent TLH, with minimal stay in hospital, with less blood loss, very minimal incisions and out of my bed within 24 hours of surgery. She is available for consultations post surgery and guides the patient for faster and better recovery from the warmth of sweet home. A big Salute to this  Life saving Warrior.",

She explained to me that ovarian cyst is a very common condition & since the size of the cyst is small, I shouldn't worry at all. For treatment she recommended I undergo a laparoscopic surgery & she dispelled any fears of surgery by answering all my questions patiently & politely. She assured me that surgery would be a daycare procedure & I could go home that very day, it was very important for me as I have 2 kids and one of them being just 4 months old. By Dr. Shafalika's efforts & god's grace the treatment was successful & I recovered in a short time & Dr. Shafalika was always there for me throughout.\n\nOverall, I had very positive experience with Dr. Shafalika & I would highly recommend her.

She explained all the options available to deal with our health problem and she told us to come back  if we decide to go ahead with surgery. My wife who is 52 years  went through laproscopic hysterectomy with only one night stay at little expensive Hospital Columbia Asia, Yeshawantpur Bengaluru. Dr Shafalika is very good in communication which is very very important for the patient and accompanying family members. Dr. Shafalika has shown us the Uterus which was affected by fibroid n overy removed immediately after the surgery. Post operation care is also good, other team of Doctors and attenders were very kind n taken care of us. Hospital is well equipped n staff is very cooperative. ",

By the grace of god I was referred to Dr Shafalika of columbia hospital. She gave us exemplary service and her response and explanation was extraordinary. Talking to her only healed my mom. Very approachable. *** ***** *** expertee regarding laproscopic surgery is highly recommendable. My mom had some adhesions due to past surgery which could have made laproscopic surgery difficult.

I was very very nervous and tensed about hysterectomy at 38. But she clearly explained about all the benefits against risks. I could openly ask all my concerns with her and she patiently explained everything. Even on the day of surgery i was very nervous and crossing my fingers but surgery went smoothly and i was discharged immediate next day.

I was so nervous about the surgery and had been postponing the surgery for 3 months, her approach made me feel the positive vibe.very simple and caring. She explained so nicely in detail about the laproscopic hystreroctomy procedures, she made me feel very comfortable I got so much faith in her, I got the courage and got the surgery done just 3 days after my visit...on 28 th March and got discharged on 29 th March. I did not feel much pain or complication inspite of such a big surgery. I could walk the very next day itself. \n Shafalika Madam is very down to earth and a humble person. She Communicates so well with the patients. The simplicity in her approach has no words to explain. She is my inspiration.\nI strongly recommend her consultation and guidance for any kind of gynaecological issues.",

I got confidence through her confidence and friendly behaviour. We got decided to go for surgery with Dr.Shafalika despite the fact that hospital was quite far from our place. My surgery was done without any complication and hospital stay was also very comfortable. I got discharged next day itself and post surgery recovery was also very quick.

Recently my wife had a fibroid, prettyy big in size. Consulted many doctors in town, everyone suggested either hystectomy or cut open surgery for mymectomy pointing to the bigger size of the fibroid.She is the only doctor who is confident of removing through lap and gave us very good comfort till the discharge and even till today post surgery. Very good in planning for surgery,  explaining the outcome of operation post surgery and great advice during the follow up....She has intensive experience with laproscopic surgeries, fibroids in particular and would definitely recommend for the needy people....",

She explained clearly what the situation is and suggested for laproscopy. She filled confidence in us for removal of only fibroid and not uterus. During surgery got to know that there was issue with right ovary and even that had to be operated. Surgery was successfull after a week of surgery I was doing all normal. Thanks for Dr. Shafalika ma'm who gave us the confidence, feeling blessed to have such a wonderful and loving Dr. ",

I underwent the surgery which to a certain extent a complicated one, was handled by the doctor so very well. The surgery was a succesful one and post operative care was also really superb. I really thank god that i was guided to a good doctor who is easily approachable, patient friendly and very informative,  and also advising correctly and that too at the right time. I owe my sincere heartfelt thanks to Dr. Shafalika and team and strongly recommend her for any gyneic problems.  Thanks Gayathri ",

I would strongly recommend every women who are suffering from fibroid and related issues to consult Dr Shafalika mam.   Intially I was very nervous about my issue.  But, after consulting mam i was very relaxed she gave me hope and advised she will do her best treat.  Last 26.12.2017 she did my laproscopic myomectomy surgery which was very successful. Me and my family are very greatful to the doctor.  May god bless her & her family with good health and good things in their life always.  Thank you once again mam.  ",

From the minute I met her, from the time of explanation of the diagnosis to comforting me about the surgery, she was on her toes. The laproscopic surgery was done with uttermost care and built confidence in me. She removed all the cysts inside me and has motivated me to lose weight and get fit. It's been a week since my surgery and she has removed all my surgery bands with minimal scare without any stitches or Staples. I am really blessed to have a doctor who is more of a friend. My family and I are grateful to ma'am and I would want her to be my gynocologist to deliver my baby when time comes.\n\nThank you ma'am!",

Doctors are very cooperative and I got it treated on right time with advance key hole laparoscopic surgery without any delays. Otherwise it would have been Life threatening. Thanks to doctors who supported. Post surgery just a overnight I was completely recovered with zero pain and back to my daily routine work in just one day. And after 5 days my bandaid was removed and I can jump exercise drive everything I want to do.  M very happy.. Many Thanks to you doctor for saving my life. ",
