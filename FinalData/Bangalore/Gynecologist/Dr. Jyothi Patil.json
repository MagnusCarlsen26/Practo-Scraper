Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial throughout the period and also kept us confident through the entire journey. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She responded to all our queries and explained things in layman language. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy was smooth, and Dr. Jyothi helped us to really enjoy it. She ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. We were blessed with a baby boy in March and we are thankful to Dr. Jyothi. We would definitely recommend Dr. Jyothi to all the future parents to be.Special Note :\u00a0 She even helped to reduce the delivery package amount from a reputed hospital. Just trust her and follow her instructions.",

Especially in these pandemic-hit times the whole plan of treatment was executed by her in such a way that I had minimum exposure to people and never had to visit a common/multispeciality facility for anything.\" \n\nNarrating the clinic visit experience is incomplete if I dint mention how sweet her supporting staff Ganesh at the clinic is. Very prompt and accomodating. Thank you dear Ganesh \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDelivery and post partum experience \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\n\"I had to undergo C section before the planned date due to early contractions on my 38th week. Had expected it to be horrifying since I had never had a surgery ever in life. C section happened, I delivered our boy and never felt I was ever cut open at all.. such good hands at what she does. I was up and walking the very next day of my C section and have only gotten better everyday after that .\"\nThank you Dr. Jyothi for this lovely first time experience.\n\nHighly recommended \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

She explained everything about the treatment to us; we put our trust in her and followed all her instructions. In our first IUI cycle we were able to conceive. Throughout our 9 months of pregnancy she made sure that she is diligent about every development. I was already overweight (almost in obese category) when I conceived. She helped me to maintain a good pregnancy weight apt for my situation to avoid any health issues for me during my pregnancy. She was also constantly monitoring baby\u2019s development and making sure that the baby is in good health. She is truly a darling and I am going to miss visiting her. She is an amazing doctor. If you have any fertility related issues, please do visit her. I had the most seemless pregnancy and delivery experience.",

Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial throughout the period and also kept us confident through the entire journey. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She responded to all our queries and explained things in layman language. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy was smooth, and Dr. Jyothi helped us to really enjoy it. She ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. We were blessed with a baby boy in March and we are thankful to Dr. Jyothi. We would definitely recommend Dr. Jyothi to all the future parents to be.Special Note :\u00a0 She even helped to reduce the delivery package amount from a reputed hospital. Just trust her and follow her instructions.",

Especially in these pandemic-hit times the whole plan of treatment was executed by her in such a way that I had minimum exposure to people and never had to visit a common/multispeciality facility for anything.\" \n\nNarrating the clinic visit experience is incomplete if I dint mention how sweet her supporting staff Ganesh at the clinic is. Very prompt and accomodating. Thank you dear Ganesh \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDelivery and post partum experience \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\n\"I had to undergo C section before the planned date due to early contractions on my 38th week. Had expected it to be horrifying since I had never had a surgery ever in life. C section happened, I delivered our boy and never felt I was ever cut open at all.. such good hands at what she does. I was up and walking the very next day of my C section and have only gotten better everyday after that .\"\nThank you Dr. Jyothi for this lovely first time experience.\n\nHighly recommended \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

She explained everything about the treatment to us; we put our trust in her and followed all her instructions. In our first IUI cycle we were able to conceive. Throughout our 9 months of pregnancy she made sure that she is diligent about every development. I was already overweight (almost in obese category) when I conceived. She helped me to maintain a good pregnancy weight apt for my situation to avoid any health issues for me during my pregnancy. She was also constantly monitoring baby\u2019s development and making sure that the baby is in good health. She is truly a darling and I am going to miss visiting her. She is an amazing doctor. If you have any fertility related issues, please do visit her. I had the most seemless pregnancy and delivery experience.",

We were just in the initial stages of that experience. You needed an able hand to guide you through these delicate emotions.\n\nOur first interaction with Dr. Patil; she made us comfortable to open our minds and discuss any apprehensions with utmost clarity. She listens, understands and then guides through the way forward with a thought out solution. While the expectations are set realistically, this is done (when we look at hindsight) to manage emotions in case of failure due to any reason. For us, it was incremental information so as to set these realistic expectations. \n\nThe interactions, explanations of the reports and the small steps of progress ensured that there was transparency on all aspects. Even when there was a setback, the negativity was managed very maturely. This also gave all involved an aspect to be extra cautious in subsequent steps. \n\nThe professional relationship moved into a comfort zone where it became more of a family one. This shows the way Dr. manages her work and gains confidence in such a very emotional & personal subject. \n\nThe reassurance of handing the baby in the hands was just not a statement. She ensured that all phases in the pregnancy and post birth of the baby were very closely monitored to ensure that the goal is achieved. Leaving out any iota of deviation or complacencies as the effort, time and of course money was involved. Her interactions and relation with colleagues, support staff and everyone in general is very amiable which helps even in the professional setup. The second opinions or references helped get clarity on any concerns.\n\nShe is an asset to the organisation that values her professional services. While finally it is in the hands of the ONE above, some of that work is given to her hands to be completed.\n\n",

After a year my wife got conceived naturally and now we are blessed with a baby girl. During the pregnancy also, Doctor monitored babies health and mother's health properly. During the labour time also she tried for normal delivery but eventually we had to go with c-section.  During that time also she explained why we are going for c section. After the delivery also, my wife recovered with in a week. One thing we can say is, Doctor treats her patients like a family member and you get the best possible treatment.\nReceptionist Ganesh speaks well and connects us with the doctor whenever required. \n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Jyothi Patil for the one who wants  to become parents.\n",

As it was a precious pregnancy for us, she made sure not to leave any stones unturned.\nThe support we received from her on each month and trimester is worth commendable. Though she is handling many cases, we felt, she has all our medical history in mind.\nCOVID 19 was the last challenge for us. Dr went extra mile to make sure the delivery happens in safest environment possible. \nWith God\u2019s grace and support of Dr, 2020 became a year of Joy for us, with our little princess.\nFrom our experience, We recommend her for any fertility related issues.\n",

We took little break from work. After that all thing started with positive result and later we had so many complications but she planned delivery very well managed . In March we got our baby with low weight but it was expected. Now my baby is doing healthy and we are enjoying parenting :)\n\nOne thing I have observed about Dr Jyothi patil. She is friendly with patients and strict too. She owns complete responsibility from conceive to birth and\n Staffs senior to junior in rainbow all are cheerful when they come for any consultation and service.\n\nThank you mam!",

Post our treatment with Dr. Jyothi Patil, i conceived and we decided to stay with Dr. Jyothi Patil though our entire pregnancy. We are now proud parents of twin boys.  It would not have been possible without the treatment from Dr. Jyothi Patil. She was always available for any clarification and was reachable at all times.

I was given proper guidance and medical care for 3 months and started my infertility treatment in Jan. \n\nThanks a ton Dr Jyoti for helping me get into this amazing journey.\n\nDr always explains our condition in detailed and provides quality care by following up with calls and changing medication if required and does not wait for us to meet her personally.\n\nShe is very friendly by nature.\n\n I have never come across a Doctor who cares about their patients so much but Dr Jyothi stands as the example where patient care is her utmost priority.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr Jyothi to anyone who have been trying to get pregnant. \n\nDr Jyothi can do miracles and we are blessed to have met her.\n\nWords can\u2019t explain to show how much we owe you Doctor.\n\nThank you !!",

Then I met Dr.Jyothi patil mam with positive hopes by looking at excellent reviews.Dr Jyothi patil patiencely  listens my problem also studied all my previous medical records througly and started treatment  . I got conceived just in one month however I had lot of stress since I had 2 miscarriage at 7 weeks .  Keeping all these things in mind , doctor did the ultrasound to monitor fetus closely  for those 2 critical  weeks for 2 days once adding with some blood thinning advanced injections to avoid probable miscarriage. Finally I have crossed 3 months and had little relief. After all these several hurdle now I'm blessed with cute little baby boy . I'm really greatful to jyothi patil mam. SHE is such a wonderful human being and well versed in gynecology & inferlity problems adding with humanity , humbleness and caring mindset. Those who are very seriously looking for a baby, I will highly recommend to visit Jyothi patil mam. Im assuring you that doctor Will try all possible  ways to give you a better result.  I always feel like \"God couldn't be every where therefore created such great human being on this earth to help needy hands\".  Once again thank you so much doctor.",

Writing this holding my 10 days old princess in lap, I can absolutely say that Dr. Jyothi  patil  has brought a miracle to us. Before meeting her, for past 4 years I went through a whole lot of bad experience trying to conceive and a few miscarriages, had spent an ample amount of money with no success and utter depression. Finally by god's grace, I met her and I still remember the first day. I was crying and she told me to leave all my worries to her and God. She gave me hope that I am going to be a mom soon.  Throughout my treatment, she guided me in my life style, diet, exercise, medicines and mental stability. She listens to every minute detail and issue very patiently.  Under her guidance and care, I finally got conceived with IVF and a little angel came in my life few days ago.  \n\nI strongly recommend ladies like me who is suffering from infertility to meet Dr Jyothi patil. *** ** *** **** *** *********** ********* *** trust me you will definitely get good results.",

She gave us the hope that we can become parents soon and we followed her guidance step by step. By March 2018 we had the best news - I got pregnant naturally which seemed like a big dream come true. This December 15th she helped us deliver a beautiful baby girl through normal delivery which has brought so much happiness in our lives.  This was all possible only due to Dr. Jyothi Patil who is like a God for us!! Thank you so much dear Doctor.",

As per our opinion, she covers all the angles which are humanly possible before following the next set of options and provides much-needed assurance.  Dr. Patil is transparent in her process which helps us to know where we actually stand and which gives us immense moral/emotional support. After multiple follow-ups and treatments from her, we finally got the \"Good News\" we wanted in a very small amount of time. I would highly recommend her for any Women Fertility & Care-related concerns. As the saying goes \" You won't go empty-handed if you knock her Door\".",

Inspite of covid situation, there was no disposable sheets being used for scans. The same sheet being used to cover the legs for all the patients. I requested the receptionist , still not done.Second concern - Doctor was very impolite in tone of talking and is impatient. Even during scan she was getting irritated by my way of keeping legs, instead of helping me.As a patient I have right to enquire about the medications, but when I asked her if there are any side effects, she took it so personally, that she replies that they would feel bad at such questions asthey have been doing this since many years.. this is very unprofessional.",

Jyothi patil after reading lots of positive reviews on internet and also one of my friends gave good feedback about her.  The best thing I liked about her throughout this journey was her temperament and a positive attitude.  She never suggested unnecessary tests and medications. After few tests, she suggested ICSI. I still remember her reassuring words after I almost gave up. She said this process needs only one good sperm and not many. Dr Jyothi Patil also said that you don't need to worry when someone has less or poor sperm count . I became thankful to this great doctor forever as I have a cute son on my lap today. No money could compensate for the changes she brought in my life. Thank you very much doctor. Long live Dr. Jyothi Patil and long live your service.",

She was very understanding and have a lot of patience to listen and answer all the questions we were asking her. During the first visit itself , Doctor told that i  will get pregnant and there is no doubt about that. Hearing it was a big relief for us and it gave us lot of confidence. We started the treatment in January and finally i got pregnant naturally in May. Iam now 28 weeks pregnant and we are eagerly waiting for our baby.  I can\u2019t express my happiness in words, we find ourselves very lucky that God brought us to Dr Jyothi patil",
