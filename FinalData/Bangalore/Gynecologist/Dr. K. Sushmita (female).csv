While I was in labor room she consoled me so much and gave strength and made me feel so comfortable and my delivery was painless. I have a daughter today only because of Dr. Sushmita. I owe her big time. She is very friendly and straight forward. She is such an optimist person. She can turn depression into happiness. God bless you.

She remembers and knows every patient's history. She takes care of all her patients so well. She has delivered around 3000 babies. She comes with a great experience. She has so many patients and yet she is never tired. She works 24/7. A Wonder Woman.

My wife had PCOD problem due to lifestyle imbalance and had irregular periods.
We had very bad experience before consulting Dr. Sushmita.
When we consulted Dr. Sushmita, she had assured us that my wife would conceive soon. The doctor was always polite, a good listener, understood the problems and proceeded with treatment on right direction. The doctor’s confidence gave us some hope.
Within a month of consultation, my wife’s period cycle was normal and within 2 months of consultation my wife was pregnant. 
There were no tests or scans conducted during our consultation. We sincerely thank  the doctor for treating my wife with ease. *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* 

About Cloud 9:
1. The hospital has good infrastructure.
2. We were initially told that the consultation is free if doctor requests visit within 3 days of previous consultation. However we were asked to pay 50% of consultation fee at the time of consultation. Please educate urself and do not manipulate things to customers.
3. We had checked the pregnancy confirmation using several pregnancy kits and the results were positive. We did check for blood report sample at cloud 9, however the report was negative. We were shattered by the report.
4. On doctor’s advice, we did proceed with  blood test again on same day with another pathology center, however the result was positive. It’s complete negligence by cloud 9.
5. We would have recommended cloud 9 for delivery if the cost was reasonable. Please do not conduct any tests at cloud 9 since the cost of each test is double compared with other pathology Center.
