None,None,0,0,Yes,"Dr Geeta is a fine professional and an excellent OBGYN. She ensured a very smooth pregnancy and delivery. She took out time during our visits to answer any questions that we may have even if it were trivial. Her availability over the weekend makes it easy for working women such as myself. During the labor process, she was very calm, encouraging - ensuring i had a normal delivery. I would highly recommend Dr Geeta.
