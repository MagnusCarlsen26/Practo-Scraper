Fortunately we found Sangeetha mam. She is someone with lots of experience and very practical in her approach. She is very accurate in  understanding the issue. My entire pregnancy journey was smooth without any hiccups. Around 36th week of my pregnancy, I had severe itching and contacted mam immediately. Went through a growth scan and it was figured out that my amniotic fluid is borderline. Mam suggested two injections for lung maturity of baby on the consecutive days and my delivery was scheduled on the third day. I was induced at around 09:30 pm and delivered my baby boy at 04:03 am (That was a super quick delivery IMO. Her diet and exercises helped a lot here). Mam was following up with duty doctor periodically with duty doctor and she even arrived at the hospital in those early hours. After delivery, I moved to my hometown and suffered from mild pains with episiotomy. Mam followed up with me on phone, took a detailed analysis and suggested treatment which again is accurate and I was able to recover within two days. \n\nI took 6 months of time to write this review as my baby boy weighed only 2.44 kg at the time of birth and I wanted to make sure everything is fine before writing review. Now, he is a happy little one meeting all his milestones and on track with birth weight chart.\n\nSo, overall it's a very positive experience with her and she is also mom-approved doctor. Her multi lingual proficiency needs a special mention.",

Dr. suggested that I have to go for a Laparoscopic surgery to remove that, I knew I was in safe hand ** *** **** ******* Post-Surgery I was really worried waiting for biopsy report and when I saw you next day, you told me 110% everything is normal and biopsy is just a hospital procedure I wanted to hug you and you allowed me to do which made me feel relaxed as there was lot running in my mind these 3 weeks and your message came yesterday after the report that report is Normal.\n\nThanks would be a small word for you Doctor who made me realize there is still \"humanity\" and \"service\" exist in this mechanical world.\n\nYour art of healing along with humbleness has made me wonder how simple humans be with so much real talent****** *** * **** ************ **** *** *********** ** *****\n\n \n\n     Yes I had known Dr. Sangeeta for a very long time, almost 7 years. I still remember the day I first met her (she is my go to Doctor since then for all my Health Problems), I was having high fever and hospitalized at St. Johnes for almost two days when I went  home after two-days fever didn\u2019t go away, one of my neighbors suggested there is a good Gynecologist why don\u2019t I see her once, I told her I was not married, why would I see Gyne for this fever, she told me you just meet her once as she is also a general physician. In the evening I went to her HSR Clinic and met Dr. Sangeeta, she examined me and took some history and suggested a few medicines and told me, my fever should come down within 24hrs and next 48hrs you should be ok and I was ok. Fever didn\u2019t come back at all after that.\n\n  4 months later I got married and I got pregnant after 6 months of my marriage. When I got pregnant, I knew I Doctor already and I didn\u2019t have to look for another Doctor as by this I had gotten very good feedback about Doctor Sangeeta including my experience. During my entire pregnancy I was so relaxed. Doctor made me so comfortable and I didn\u2019t have to worry abt anything I had low placenta and she guided me through entire my pregnancy, each time I went for checkup she made me feel so good with her beautiful smile on her face. She sent me to St. Philomena for delivery I wondered why when cloud 9 is close to me but later I realized it was a best decision Dr. Sangeeta took as I was being taken care so well, including arranging a expert Doctor for guiding me how to breastfeed when I was struggling to feed. \n\n    Doctor Sangeeta not only be with us during entire Delivery period or a surgery but she also guide us through our recovery. You just have to call the clinic number and leave message and she will guide us over a message. She may call back only if it is necessary else she will respond to your message , I understand she is busy and most beautiful thing about her she will respond to message \n",

After 5 years of various treatment and one failed IUI we have almost lot hope of divine blessing. Then one of our fried suggested about Dr.  Sangeetha Gomes of \u201cCare Clinic\u201d in HSR Layout Bangalore. By this time we have decided to go for IVF after lots of research.\n In the first visit to care clinic (Dr. Santgeetha Gomes) we decided to go ahead with IVF treatment and doctor also rightly suggested not to waste too much time on different treatment and medicines. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes is very humble and cleared all out doubts without getting irritated by the silly questions. And explained all pros and cons of the treatment, cost associated with the treatment etc. \nFor egg collection and transfer process we are advised to meet Dr. Manjunath from NOVA. It was great to meet another humble and caring doctor. Both the doctors (Dr. Sangeetha Gomes and Dr. Manjunath) took care of all the process and treatment very well. Facilities and support staff at NOVA also was very good. Finally egg collection day came and we were happy that 18 eggs were collected, but after 2 weeks we came to know that out of 18 only 2 were grown as embryo. By the gods grace and proper care / treatments by the doctors, out of the 2 embryos one was successful. We were luckiest as only 2 embryos were there and it was successful as there was no chance for 2nd transfer. \nPregnancy care after this are \u201cCare Clinic\u201d was at its best. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes has advised us on each steps to be taken care of. We generally used to barge in to clinic to ask some silly doubts due to the tension of precious pregnancy, but Dr. Sangeetha Gomes cleared all our doubts properly without any hesitation. 9 months journey was very smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. Support staff of the care clinic also were really good. \nWe have selected motherhood hospital Sarjapur Road for the big day. It was grand welcome for the little one and all in the family were on cloud nine. Dr. Sangeetha has arrived on time for the delivery, regularly visited us and advised duty doctor / support staff very well.  \nExperience at \u201cMotherhood Hospital\u201d was very enriching throughout the delivery process and stay till discharge. Services in all departments of hospital was very good including admin and billing / insurance. Nursing staff has taken care of baby very well, even in the midnight also we can see the smiling face. \nThanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes / Dr. Manjunath and Motherhood team. I strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes if you are planning for pregnancy or for treatment for infertility. \n",

                "review_text": "A year ago we had relocated to Sarjapur area and were in search of good gynaecologist and hospital to get help. Since Motherhood hospital was very close to our house we started researching about the hospital and found it quite good (based on reviews). For selecting the doctor, we took some time. We read all the reviews and after a lot of deliberation we decide to visit Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. And I MUST say that was the best decision we made. Since it is very easy to get misguided in this sensitive issue of \u2018planning for a family\u2019, it becomes necessary to get a right kind of doctor and Dr. Gomes is a wonderful doctor. We visited Dr. Gomes in the month of July \u201919 for pre-pregnancy check-ups wherein she asked us to undergo a list of tests (which was fair too). When she found out that my fertility rate was very low, she right away suggested some treatments after giving proper counselling. We must say that the doctor has very very positive vibes with very practical attitude. She makes everything sounds doable. However, in our case she turned out to be our \u2018lucky charm\u2019. Because after visiting her the next month itself I got conceived all naturally. So, for us she is a lucky mascot. Since then she is our DOCTOR. During the entire pregnancy she gave us right kind of advice and if there was something concerning instead of panicking, she would immediately suggest next steps. We love our consultation sessions which used to be not more than 5 minutes but gave us so much relief (and good laughter sometimes). We always felt she is a very cool doctor who can lighten the whole situation with her style of consulting. I delivered my baby girl during lock-down (April\u201920) through caesareans delivery (we had decided to go for surgery instead of normal delivery to avoid any risk during this outbreak. Doctor had properly explained to us that C-section is not a bad option and there is no risk too.). We must say that those 9 months went by very smooth and we thank her for every bit. She never suggests any unnecessary tests or medicines. I used to go with list of questions, and she would answer them all. We really recommend DR Sangeeta Gomes and we suggest to at least meet her once. \n\nAbout the hospital, we have only good things to talk about just like DR Gomes. Very polite staff and very well managed facility. We have never experienced any chaos or never had any trouble throughout. The nursing staff at the hospital is fantastic and have been very patient with us post-delivery. They extended their support in everything and we really like to thank them specifically (nursing staff at second floor). We certainly recommended Motherhood Sarjapur hospital to everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "review_text": "We were blessed with a baby Girl on 22/04/2019, we have started consulted Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in 2017 after one of our family friend (From our Apartment) has recommended to check with her as they also got benefited with her consultancy and blessed with the Baby Boy, \nPrior to consulting with DR. Sangeetha, we have consulted more than 3 other doctors in recognized hospitals of Bangalore. We have wasted 3+ years of time, energy and money with these Gynecologist, where every time we just get confirmation of next appointments dates and medicals bills. Among Three Dr.s One Dr. has referred to another Dr. after 1.5 years of consultancy, we never gone there again. And because of one dr.\u2019s tremens my wife\u2019s lungs filled with water. We almost most lost trust on any Dr.\nThen our journey started with Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in July 2017 and in the 1st visit itself we realized that we can trust this Dr. and we were not wrong about this realization and my wife conceived within 4 months of her treatments, completely natural pregnancy, unfortunately it didn\u2019t go well and no heartbeats heard from 1st pregnancy.\nNext Good News came after 1 year in Aug 2018 and we are very happy with complete duration of treatment and delivery went well and blessed with little angle.\nThese 2 years have been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. She is very patient and humble, and listens to you calmly unlike the other doctors who are on a rush to consult the waiting patients. We meet her at her clinic as well as Motherhood hospital from the very beginning of our pre-pregnancy and pregnancy. She gave very detailed advice at every stage, her staff was also very supportive and responsive all the time. And she always recommends natural remedies whenever required. She treats you as well-known person I was always surprise to see that she recalls all the medical history without seeing the files despites of many patients.\nThis was our 2nd Pregnancy, we were guided by Dr. Sangeetha Gomes at each phase. She handled our case very sensitively. We faced some issues like cough, cold and fevers and also an accidental Water burns in 8th month and we were very scared but, she did everything that can be done by her by regular checkup, Scans, Hb Tests, TSH Test, Blood Sugar Test and other necessary Tests like NST was done regularly to monitor heart rate of Baby - all reports were normal. \nWe opted Mother Hood Hospital. Dr. has given dates in 38th week where my wife has admitted in the hospital and same day delivery happened in the morning. My wife delivered our baby Girl on 22nd April 2019 and got discharged on 24th April 2019. She used to help her with all our worries/queries and being transparent in diagnosing her which helped us to build trust on her. She had also helped us in post-Pregnancy with proper advice and Medications. I gained almost 12 kgs. And was able to complete my term in 38 weeks and my daughter was born healthy and she is doing well. \nI would highly recommend her for anyone who is planning pregnancy or for all kind of gynecology related consultancy..",

Around a year into our marriage, my wife encountered health issues\u2014vaginal infections and irregular periods\u2014leading us to seek medical assistance. Initially, we consulted a doctor who, despite treating her, lacked warmth and delivered distressing news: suggesting that a normal pregnancy might be challenging and advocating for IVF due to an underlying issue.\n\nDevastatingly, after conceiving naturally back in our hometown, we faced a miscarriage at two months into the pregnancy. This loss left us deeply disheartened. However, upon returning to Bangalore and seeking a second opinion, we were fortunate to learn about Sangeeta Mam through a colleague at my workplace.\n\nSangeeta Mam's approach was a game-changer. Her empathetic demeanor and reassurance filled us with hope. Instead of discouragement, she offered encouragement, sharing her own experiences and stories of other couples who had overcome similar challenges. Under her guidance and care, my wife underwent a tailored treatment plan.\n\nWhat struck us most was Mam's ability to transform the atmosphere in her office. Couples, initially weighed down by sadness, left her room with smiles, having found comfort, positivity, and renewed hope.\n\nAfter six months of dedicated care under Mam's guidance, we returned to West Bengal. And thanks to Mam's expertise, my wife successfully delivered our first child\u2014a beautiful baby boy. Sangeeta Mam's consultations were not just medical but also deeply personal and uplifting. Her unwavering support made our journey to parenthood a fulfilling and joyful one.\n\nFor anyone facing similar challenges, we wholeheartedly recommend Sangeeta Mam's expert care. You'll not only receive exceptional medical guidance but also find solace and optimism in her compassionate approach.",

Somehow I felt, I was being mislead by my previous doctor. Cutting the long story short, finally I came across an undesirable miscarriage. while announcing the miscarriage upon an ultrasound at the doctor's clinic, the previous doctor tagged my pregnancy as a scar ectopic pregnancy which was earlier never established in my previous scans. I was also told that there was abundant vascularity in and around my uterus for which is why I should go for a Intrasac Methotrate process for abortion. Somehow I was not convinced with this advise and felt this could be life-threatening. \n\nImmediately  I decided to go for a second opinion. I went to doctor  Sangeet Gomes( found on Google with great reviews) the same evening with all my medical papers. There was a huge queue. However, looking at my condition, she agreed to see me at the earliest. She was super diligent in looking at my history and with her level of knowledge , genuinity and expertise, she could immediately instill confidence in me as a doctor. I got really good vibes from that very moment and requested her to take up my case entirely and treat myself accordingly. She was gracious enough to guide me the best possible way with proper and systematic investigation and medical steps in place. Finally at a very reasonable cost she took me through a Suction and Evacuation process at Manipal Hospital where she ensured I get the right and absolute care. She herself visited me and called up multiple times to check on my status while I was admitted. She did the procedure with amazing backup plans and preparations in place to ensure my physical safety. I am truly humbled by her gesture as a doctor. Even now after two months of my abortion, I still get calls from Care clinic to check on my health and wellbeing. I am deeply indebted to doctor Sangeeta Gomes for being there with me like a \" caring mother\" if not more.  Thank you doctor. Best regards.",

But after visiting Dr Sangeetha gomes she supported me very well, and guided me with very friendly manner.\n\n After taking 4 months of treatment. FInally the day has came that i was conceived on july 2017. The pregnancy stage went smooth.She prescribed only the required tests and medicines and always guided whenever i have any query. I started getting regular call from the clinic regarding update on my health condition. She is very much experienced and understands your problem quickly,analyses the root causes. She will advice and explains everything in detail with patience. She doesn't make you go through unneccesary scans unless needed. Staff of the \"care clinic\" taken me very care.\n\nWe have selected Motherhood hospital Sarjapur for the bigday . Suddenly i started getting pains. I intimated to hospital. She called to motherhood hospital, when i reached to hospital everyone was ready to take care for my delivery. Dr. sangeetha Gomes has arrived on time for the delivery. Duty Dr. and nurses taken me very care. 1hr of continues labour pains, finally...\n\nOn 8th March 2018, I am blessed with cute little baby boy with \"NORMAL DELIVERY\". When i am getting pains she supports me very well and she encourages me to deliver normally. She allowed my mother when i am getting pains in labour room for supporting me. It was grand welcome for the little one and all in the family were on cloud nine.\n\nAfter delivery she suggested me to take HPV vaccination. Post- pregnancy also, i am getting regular call from care clinic to know about mine and baby health.\n\nExperience at \u201cMotherhood Hospital\u201d was very enriching throughout the delivery process and stay till discharge. Services in all departments of hospital was very good including admin and billing / insurance. Nursing staff has taken care of baby very well, even in the midnight also we can see the smiling face.\n\nThanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes ,staff of care clinic and Motherhood team. I strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes if you are planning for pregnancy or  infertility treatments.\n\nI always refer her to everyone. I always got a motherly care from her. \n\nThanks alot Doctor for everything.",

Fortunately we found Sangeetha mam. She is someone with lots of experience and very practical in her approach. She is very accurate in  understanding the issue. My entire pregnancy journey was smooth without any hiccups. Around 36th week of my pregnancy, I had severe itching and contacted mam immediately. Went through a growth scan and it was figured out that my amniotic fluid is borderline. Mam suggested two injections for lung maturity of baby on the consecutive days and my delivery was scheduled on the third day. I was induced at around 09:30 pm and delivered my baby boy at 04:03 am (That was a super quick delivery IMO. Her diet and exercises helped a lot here). Mam was following up with duty doctor periodically with duty doctor and she even arrived at the hospital in those early hours. After delivery, I moved to my hometown and suffered from mild pains with episiotomy. Mam followed up with me on phone, took a detailed analysis and suggested treatment which again is accurate and I was able to recover within two days. \n\nI took 6 months of time to write this review as my baby boy weighed only 2.44 kg at the time of birth and I wanted to make sure everything is fine before writing review. Now, he is a happy little one meeting all his milestones and on track with birth weight chart.\n\nSo, overall it's a very positive experience with her and she is also mom-approved doctor. Her multi lingual proficiency needs a special mention.",

Dr. suggested that I have to go for a Laparoscopic surgery to remove that, I knew I was in safe hand ** *** **** ******* Post-Surgery I was really worried waiting for biopsy report and when I saw you next day, you told me 110% everything is normal and biopsy is just a hospital procedure I wanted to hug you and you allowed me to do which made me feel relaxed as there was lot running in my mind these 3 weeks and your message came yesterday after the report that report is Normal.\n\nThanks would be a small word for you Doctor who made me realize there is still \"humanity\" and \"service\" exist in this mechanical world.\n\nYour art of healing along with humbleness has made me wonder how simple humans be with so much real talent****** *** * **** ************ **** *** *********** ** *****\n\n \n\n     Yes I had known Dr. Sangeeta for a very long time, almost 7 years. I still remember the day I first met her (she is my go to Doctor since then for all my Health Problems), I was having high fever and hospitalized at St. Johnes for almost two days when I went  home after two-days fever didn\u2019t go away, one of my neighbors suggested there is a good Gynecologist why don\u2019t I see her once, I told her I was not married, why would I see Gyne for this fever, she told me you just meet her once as she is also a general physician. In the evening I went to her HSR Clinic and met Dr. Sangeeta, she examined me and took some history and suggested a few medicines and told me, my fever should come down within 24hrs and next 48hrs you should be ok and I was ok. Fever didn\u2019t come back at all after that.\n\n  4 months later I got married and I got pregnant after 6 months of my marriage. When I got pregnant, I knew I Doctor already and I didn\u2019t have to look for another Doctor as by this I had gotten very good feedback about Doctor Sangeeta including my experience. During my entire pregnancy I was so relaxed. Doctor made me so comfortable and I didn\u2019t have to worry abt anything I had low placenta and she guided me through entire my pregnancy, each time I went for checkup she made me feel so good with her beautiful smile on her face. She sent me to St. Philomena for delivery I wondered why when cloud 9 is close to me but later I realized it was a best decision Dr. Sangeeta took as I was being taken care so well, including arranging a expert Doctor for guiding me how to breastfeed when I was struggling to feed. \n\n    Doctor Sangeeta not only be with us during entire Delivery period or a surgery but she also guide us through our recovery. You just have to call the clinic number and leave message and she will guide us over a message. She may call back only if it is necessary else she will respond to your message , I understand she is busy and most beautiful thing about her she will respond to message \n",

After 5 years of various treatment and one failed IUI we have almost lot hope of divine blessing. Then one of our fried suggested about Dr.  Sangeetha Gomes of \u201cCare Clinic\u201d in HSR Layout Bangalore. By this time we have decided to go for IVF after lots of research.\n In the first visit to care clinic (Dr. Santgeetha Gomes) we decided to go ahead with IVF treatment and doctor also rightly suggested not to waste too much time on different treatment and medicines. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes is very humble and cleared all out doubts without getting irritated by the silly questions. And explained all pros and cons of the treatment, cost associated with the treatment etc. \nFor egg collection and transfer process we are advised to meet Dr. Manjunath from NOVA. It was great to meet another humble and caring doctor. Both the doctors (Dr. Sangeetha Gomes and Dr. Manjunath) took care of all the process and treatment very well. Facilities and support staff at NOVA also was very good. Finally egg collection day came and we were happy that 18 eggs were collected, but after 2 weeks we came to know that out of 18 only 2 were grown as embryo. By the gods grace and proper care / treatments by the doctors, out of the 2 embryos one was successful. We were luckiest as only 2 embryos were there and it was successful as there was no chance for 2nd transfer. \nPregnancy care after this are \u201cCare Clinic\u201d was at its best. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes has advised us on each steps to be taken care of. We generally used to barge in to clinic to ask some silly doubts due to the tension of precious pregnancy, but Dr. Sangeetha Gomes cleared all our doubts properly without any hesitation. 9 months journey was very smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. Support staff of the care clinic also were really good. \nWe have selected motherhood hospital Sarjapur Road for the big day. It was grand welcome for the little one and all in the family were on cloud nine. Dr. Sangeetha has arrived on time for the delivery, regularly visited us and advised duty doctor / support staff very well.  \nExperience at \u201cMotherhood Hospital\u201d was very enriching throughout the delivery process and stay till discharge. Services in all departments of hospital was very good including admin and billing / insurance. Nursing staff has taken care of baby very well, even in the midnight also we can see the smiling face. \nThanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes / Dr. Manjunath and Motherhood team. I strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes if you are planning for pregnancy or for treatment for infertility. \n",

                "review_text": "A year ago we had relocated to Sarjapur area and were in search of good gynaecologist and hospital to get help. Since Motherhood hospital was very close to our house we started researching about the hospital and found it quite good (based on reviews). For selecting the doctor, we took some time. We read all the reviews and after a lot of deliberation we decide to visit Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. And I MUST say that was the best decision we made. Since it is very easy to get misguided in this sensitive issue of \u2018planning for a family\u2019, it becomes necessary to get a right kind of doctor and Dr. Gomes is a wonderful doctor. We visited Dr. Gomes in the month of July \u201919 for pre-pregnancy check-ups wherein she asked us to undergo a list of tests (which was fair too). When she found out that my fertility rate was very low, she right away suggested some treatments after giving proper counselling. We must say that the doctor has very very positive vibes with very practical attitude. She makes everything sounds doable. However, in our case she turned out to be our \u2018lucky charm\u2019. Because after visiting her the next month itself I got conceived all naturally. So, for us she is a lucky mascot. Since then she is our DOCTOR. During the entire pregnancy she gave us right kind of advice and if there was something concerning instead of panicking, she would immediately suggest next steps. We love our consultation sessions which used to be not more than 5 minutes but gave us so much relief (and good laughter sometimes). We always felt she is a very cool doctor who can lighten the whole situation with her style of consulting. I delivered my baby girl during lock-down (April\u201920) through caesareans delivery (we had decided to go for surgery instead of normal delivery to avoid any risk during this outbreak. Doctor had properly explained to us that C-section is not a bad option and there is no risk too.). We must say that those 9 months went by very smooth and we thank her for every bit. She never suggests any unnecessary tests or medicines. I used to go with list of questions, and she would answer them all. We really recommend DR Sangeeta Gomes and we suggest to at least meet her once. \n\nAbout the hospital, we have only good things to talk about just like DR Gomes. Very polite staff and very well managed facility. We have never experienced any chaos or never had any trouble throughout. The nursing staff at the hospital is fantastic and have been very patient with us post-delivery. They extended their support in everything and we really like to thank them specifically (nursing staff at second floor). We certainly recommended Motherhood Sarjapur hospital to everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "review_text": "We were blessed with a baby Girl on 22/04/2019, we have started consulted Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in 2017 after one of our family friend (From our Apartment) has recommended to check with her as they also got benefited with her consultancy and blessed with the Baby Boy, \nPrior to consulting with DR. Sangeetha, we have consulted more than 3 other doctors in recognized hospitals of Bangalore. We have wasted 3+ years of time, energy and money with these Gynecologist, where every time we just get confirmation of next appointments dates and medicals bills. Among Three Dr.s One Dr. has referred to another Dr. after 1.5 years of consultancy, we never gone there again. And because of one dr.\u2019s tremens my wife\u2019s lungs filled with water. We almost most lost trust on any Dr.\nThen our journey started with Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in July 2017 and in the 1st visit itself we realized that we can trust this Dr. and we were not wrong about this realization and my wife conceived within 4 months of her treatments, completely natural pregnancy, unfortunately it didn\u2019t go well and no heartbeats heard from 1st pregnancy.\nNext Good News came after 1 year in Aug 2018 and we are very happy with complete duration of treatment and delivery went well and blessed with little angle.\nThese 2 years have been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. She is very patient and humble, and listens to you calmly unlike the other doctors who are on a rush to consult the waiting patients. We meet her at her clinic as well as Motherhood hospital from the very beginning of our pre-pregnancy and pregnancy. She gave very detailed advice at every stage, her staff was also very supportive and responsive all the time. And she always recommends natural remedies whenever required. She treats you as well-known person I was always surprise to see that she recalls all the medical history without seeing the files despites of many patients.\nThis was our 2nd Pregnancy, we were guided by Dr. Sangeetha Gomes at each phase. She handled our case very sensitively. We faced some issues like cough, cold and fevers and also an accidental Water burns in 8th month and we were very scared but, she did everything that can be done by her by regular checkup, Scans, Hb Tests, TSH Test, Blood Sugar Test and other necessary Tests like NST was done regularly to monitor heart rate of Baby - all reports were normal. \nWe opted Mother Hood Hospital. Dr. has given dates in 38th week where my wife has admitted in the hospital and same day delivery happened in the morning. My wife delivered our baby Girl on 22nd April 2019 and got discharged on 24th April 2019. She used to help her with all our worries/queries and being transparent in diagnosing her which helped us to build trust on her. She had also helped us in post-Pregnancy with proper advice and Medications. I gained almost 12 kgs. And was able to complete my term in 38 weeks and my daughter was born healthy and she is doing well. \nI would highly recommend her for anyone who is planning pregnancy or for all kind of gynecology related consultancy..",

Around a year into our marriage, my wife encountered health issues\u2014vaginal infections and irregular periods\u2014leading us to seek medical assistance. Initially, we consulted a doctor who, despite treating her, lacked warmth and delivered distressing news: suggesting that a normal pregnancy might be challenging and advocating for IVF due to an underlying issue.\n\nDevastatingly, after conceiving naturally back in our hometown, we faced a miscarriage at two months into the pregnancy. This loss left us deeply disheartened. However, upon returning to Bangalore and seeking a second opinion, we were fortunate to learn about Sangeeta Mam through a colleague at my workplace.\n\nSangeeta Mam's approach was a game-changer. Her empathetic demeanor and reassurance filled us with hope. Instead of discouragement, she offered encouragement, sharing her own experiences and stories of other couples who had overcome similar challenges. Under her guidance and care, my wife underwent a tailored treatment plan.\n\nWhat struck us most was Mam's ability to transform the atmosphere in her office. Couples, initially weighed down by sadness, left her room with smiles, having found comfort, positivity, and renewed hope.\n\nAfter six months of dedicated care under Mam's guidance, we returned to West Bengal. And thanks to Mam's expertise, my wife successfully delivered our first child\u2014a beautiful baby boy. Sangeeta Mam's consultations were not just medical but also deeply personal and uplifting. Her unwavering support made our journey to parenthood a fulfilling and joyful one.\n\nFor anyone facing similar challenges, we wholeheartedly recommend Sangeeta Mam's expert care. You'll not only receive exceptional medical guidance but also find solace and optimism in her compassionate approach.",

Somehow I felt, I was being mislead by my previous doctor. Cutting the long story short, finally I came across an undesirable miscarriage. while announcing the miscarriage upon an ultrasound at the doctor's clinic, the previous doctor tagged my pregnancy as a scar ectopic pregnancy which was earlier never established in my previous scans. I was also told that there was abundant vascularity in and around my uterus for which is why I should go for a Intrasac Methotrate process for abortion. Somehow I was not convinced with this advise and felt this could be life-threatening. \n\nImmediately  I decided to go for a second opinion. I went to doctor  Sangeet Gomes( found on Google with great reviews) the same evening with all my medical papers. There was a huge queue. However, looking at my condition, she agreed to see me at the earliest. She was super diligent in looking at my history and with her level of knowledge , genuinity and expertise, she could immediately instill confidence in me as a doctor. I got really good vibes from that very moment and requested her to take up my case entirely and treat myself accordingly. She was gracious enough to guide me the best possible way with proper and systematic investigation and medical steps in place. Finally at a very reasonable cost she took me through a Suction and Evacuation process at Manipal Hospital where she ensured I get the right and absolute care. She herself visited me and called up multiple times to check on my status while I was admitted. She did the procedure with amazing backup plans and preparations in place to ensure my physical safety. I am truly humbled by her gesture as a doctor. Even now after two months of my abortion, I still get calls from Care clinic to check on my health and wellbeing. I am deeply indebted to doctor Sangeeta Gomes for being there with me like a \" caring mother\" if not more.  Thank you doctor. Best regards.",

I was bit worried on getting pregnant as we planned to have little one after three years of our marriage. I had a PCOD problem with that i was so disappointed to concieve. But after visiting Dr Sangeetha gomes she supported me very well, and guided me with very friendly manner.\n\n After taking 4 months of treatment. FInally the day has came that i was conceived on july 2017. The pregnancy stage went smooth.She prescribed only the required tests and medicines and always guided whenever i have any query. I started getting regular call from the clinic regarding update on my health condition. She is very much experienced and understands your problem quickly,analyses the root causes. She will advice and explains everything in detail with patience. She doesn't make you go through unneccesary scans unless needed. Staff of the \"care clinic\" taken me very care.\n\nWe have selected Motherhood hospital Sarjapur for the bigday . Suddenly i started getting pains. I intimated to hospital. She called to motherhood hospital, when i reached to hospital everyone was ready to take care for my delivery. Dr. sangeetha Gomes has arrived on time for the delivery. Duty Dr. and nurses taken me very care. 1hr of continues labour pains, finally...\n\nOn 8th March 2018, I am blessed with cute little baby boy with \"NORMAL DELIVERY\". When i am getting pains she supports me very well and she encourages me to deliver normally. She allowed my mother when i am getting pains in labour room for supporting me. It was grand welcome for the little one and all in the family were on cloud nine.\n\nAfter delivery she suggested me to take HPV vaccination. Post- pregnancy also, i am getting regular call from care clinic to know about mine and baby health.\n\nExperience at \u201cMotherhood Hospital\u201d was very enriching throughout the delivery process and stay till discharge. Services in all departments of hospital was very good including admin and billing / insurance. Nursing staff has taken care of baby very well, even in the midnight also we can see the smiling face.\n\nThanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes ,staff of care clinic and Motherhood team. I strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes if you are planning for pregnancy or  infertility treatments.\n\nI always refer her to everyone.

The reason is simple, her diagnosis is superb and the medication she prescribes works Everytime. Most recently I have been consulting her for pregnancy. Only because of her timely checkup schedules I delivered a healthy baby without any issue to my health. She kept checking on me by regularly calling  me if i had any cold or fever from eighth month onwards. I have never seen a doctor who takes care of their patients in such a personalised way. She will never put you in panic. She gives lot of confidence to her patients. A very good thing about her is, during pregnancy along with the medications she suggests some home remedies also for pain, cold, etc, which is very good since I wanted to take minimum medicines during pregnancy. \n\nShe was preparing me for a normal delivery since start. She told me the diet to follow, the exercise to do. Although during labor my baby's heart beat dropped to a critical level, because of which she had to do an emergency operation. But within 10 days the wound was completely clear. \n\nDuring my stay in hospital she used to regularly call me to check my health and enquire whether the hospital staff is taking good care of me or not, since she was not an in-house doctor.\nWe were very relaxed from the doctor front during entire 9 months and even post pregnancy.\n\nI will definitely recommend her any expecting mother. I referred her to few of my friends and all of them are happy consulting her.",

My first child was born preterm in an emergency delivery as I suffered from preeclapsia and high BP. Hence I was very cautious for the second pregnancy. Experienced doctor, medical facilities and proximity were my criteria for choosing the doctor \u2013 Dr. Sangeeta satisfied these completely. \nThroughout the pregnancy, she handled my case proactively and had complete hold of things. She was completely patient in hearing me out, handling my concerns. Never during the treatment had she asked us to get any unnecessary test done. Also, when it was time for utmost care, she rightly asked me for regular monitoring and took timely call for the operation.\n** ******* *** **** **** ********** * no complication no panic unlike my previous experience. Stitches were neat and healed quickly. She is a tough taskmaster and kept the support staff on toes. Though even my second baby was born preterm with low birth weight, I would not blame the doctor as she took all the possible steps to avoid this.\nAreas on which I was not satisfied are minor. Firstly, she is not directly accessible. Her phone number will be handled by her clinic nurses. You may not be able to talk to her even during emergency.\nSecondly, I was not completely satisfied with any of the hospitals that she visits. She is a consultant and hence there is a disconnect post the delivery. Post-delivery care is left to junior, unexperienced doctors and nurses who are guided over phone by Dr. Sangeeta. So in case of any complication, you are at mercy of these incapable doctors.\nOverall, I had really good experience with the doctor. I truly thank her for providing me the best medical advice and above all imbibing positive thinking.",

Ours was a high risk pregnancy due to multiple complications and Dr. Gomes was really patient in answering all our queries and concerns. She scolds you when you worry unnecessarily and is equally caring when required. There was an instance during our pregnancy period when we couldn\u2019t feel movements of our baby, she quickly made few calls and redirected us to the hospital where we could get a Doppler done at that time of the night. The scan was ok, but she was waiting for us at her clinic after her consulting hours to have a look at the report.\n \nMother and baby's health used to be her primary focus all the time. Closer to the delivery, because of the complications she made us visit her every alternate day monitoring the progress. We used to get NST done at her clinic and she had a good cordial team of nursing staff to take care of her.\n \nSince we were consulting at her clinic, she gave us all the hospital options where we could get the delivery done, pushed us to visit the hospitals to find out which one we were comfortable with. She is always upfront in terms of medication and treatment costs and even gave us an estimate of how much it would cost at each of the hospital. We had a planned C-section at Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta road at 36 weeks since the baby was IUGR and mother had placenta previa condition. Taking into account the potential complications that might arise at the time of surgery, Dr. Sangeetha had suggested Fortis for the delivery. She made sure we were comfortable by explaining us why she choose Fortis and even took the pains of calling up the concerned person at the hospital and getting a room booked.\n \nPost delivery, during the time when mother and baby were still at the hospital, we used to get call from the clinic every other day checking on the health of the baby and the mother.\n \nWe would strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes and especially consulting at her clinic for a stress free pregnancy period.",

Our journey through these 8 months has been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. She is very patient and humble, and listens to you calmly unlike the other doctors who are on a rush to consult the waiting patients. We meet her at her clinic (CARE CLINIC at HSR Layout) from the very beginning of my pregnancy. I have a son (12 Years) and my second Pregnancy was miscarried in St. John\u2019s Hospital due to doctor\u2019s negligence. This was my third Pregnancy I was guided by Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. She handled my case very sensitively. \r\nI found some spotting and bleeding  from the beginning of this Pregnancy and it lasts still 7th month and I was very scared but, she did everything that can be done by her by regular checkup , Scans, Hb Tests, TSH Test, Blood Sugar Test and other necessary Tests even Papsmear was done due to my spotting - all reports were normal.\r\nI opted St. Philomena\u2019s Hospital. On 30th week I felt the contractions and went to her clinic and consequently during 2 weeks I have done 2 NSTs and given duvadilan medicine to minimize the abdominal contraction pain and she immediately advised to take belic injection(1 dose)and betnosole injection(2 doses).\r\nBut on 34th  weeks my water breakage started at night and I admitted St. Philomena\u2019s Hospital immediately as per her advice, but my platelet count was found less(<46000) and she immediately rushed me to Fortis Hospital (Bannerghatta Road) for platelet transfusion before going to C-section on the same Hospital. I delivered my baby Girl on 7th  March 2016 and got discharged on 10th March 2016.\r\nShe used to help me with all my worries/queries and being transparent in diagnosing me which helped me to build trust on her. She had also helped me post-Pregnancy with proper advice and Medications.\r\nI gained 12 kgs. and was able to complete my term in 34 weeks and my daughter was born healthy and she is doing well you need to have faith on your Doctor and I would strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes.\r\n",

In the first visit itself we were very impressed by her attitude and behavior. She always suggests you the proper guidelines, but it never appears as hard or tough to follow. It was the obvious choice that we followed her consultation when we planned for our baby. Under her guidance, the 9 month journey was very smooth and we never had a moment of anxiety as we knew we had her with us to take us out of any difficulties, if any. During the hospital admission and the delivery process also she was there to guide us and provided her valuable insights to make the process smooth. After the delivery, she was following up with the duty doctors in the hospital and provided recommendations for the care of both mother and baby. Next day onwards for the rounds, she used to visit and tell us not to feel as we're in a hospital, like nothing has happened (note: we had a c-section) and encouraged us to get back to normal flow of life. She is the best we could have had as our guide and we're really blessed that she could be our advisor in the whole journey. Anyone who is planning for a baby, or even want to have a general gynaecology consultation, and if you're near or around Sarjapur/HSR area - she's the best you can have to consult with. Wish the very best to Sangeeta ma'am, may God bless you. \n\nP. S - A special mention to the sisters in Care clinic, who always kept in touch to check on the baby and mother's health after the delivery. They always responded to emergency questions made over phone and in general, are very friendly and helpful. Thanks to them, too.",

I had consulted with Dr. Sangeetha from the 4th month of my pregnancy onwards. And I am so glad I chose her as my Obstetrician, it is one of the best decisions in my life. *** ********* ** ** ********* ********* ************* *** well experienced doctor. During the later part of my pregnancy, I had developed some complications, and Dr. Sangeetha chose to treat me via bed rest and simple medications instead of surgery. Under her guidance, I completed 36 weeks successfully and gave birth to a healthy child via normal delivery at St. Philomenas Hospital. I am very grateful to Dr. Sangeetha because my labour started at midnight. Dr. Sangeetha immediately came all the way to St. Philomenas at 1.30 a.m. early in the morning by herself to assist me in my delivery. As a first time mother at 34 years, seeing her join me in the labour room was one of the most reassuring feelings of my life. I truly appreciate the fact that she came to deliver my child (at 1.30 in the morning till 6 a.m) instead of just giving instructions to another doctor. Such dedication and commitment is a very rare quality! Dr.Sangeetha was like a family member in the labour room and she tried her best for me to have a normal delivery, which in the end I did. Her team followed up very well post delivery too. I would strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha to anyone who wants * ******* *** ******* ************************* by your side at one of your most vulnerable moments.

I had lost hope of becoming a mother, having met almost all top shot gynecologists in bangalore without any positive outcome. When we got to know about her, looking a gynecologist in hsr, I had expected my consultation  to be the same as other famous gynecologists in bangalore- doctors meet you for five minutes and send you off for numerous tests.  She has what others lack-personal touch. But we were pleasantly surprised by the way she approached our problem.  She is everything you would want in your doctor and more than that she is a wonder person. It  was such a relief to finally get a wonderful doctor who instantly took charge of my problem and took care of me like a special person.  She took time to analyze my case and charted our a treatment plan designed specifically for me. She is highly efficient and methodical in her approach. She is friendly and patiently answered all trivial queries that we had, something that we found lacking in others. She is also very very positive and extremely confident which also puts the patient in a positive frame of mind, much needed when you are battling infertility. Her able guidance helped me survive my difficult pregnancy with almost all listed complications - diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, carrying twin-with ease and to a near full term without any mishaps, which would have been otherwise impossible. Meeting her was so soothing that I would actually look forward to our monthly consultations during my pregnancy. I could reach her anytime via sms or phone call in case of emergency. She is well connected to good doctors also and this helped us in managing  the other problems that I had.  Thanks to her, we are now proud parents a boy/girl twins and this happened within a year and half of first meeting her.  She is an excellent surgeon and I was up and about within 12 hours of undergoing an emergency c section and healed completely within a week. The nurses at her clinic are also competent and well trained . I wish her all success and I pray to God that may she continue to enrich the lives of many more desperate couples wanting to become parents. I strongly recommend Dr Sangeeta to anyone looking for a good gynecologist particularly for infertility. You will be in good hands.  ",

I am very satisfied with the way Dr. Sangeeta handled my case. One thing that stood out in all the regular checkups is that she is very experienced and gets the signals quite early For Eg. in our case she asked me to control diet to make sure that baby weight doesn't become too much to create complications in Normal Delivery, and it turned out that baby was fully grown(3 KG) when I normally delivered in my 37th week of pregnancy. \n\nOne more thing I observed about the doctor is that she is very patient and avoids unneccessary steps as much as possible. During the 9th month we observed that Baby's heart rate used to spike above 180, while she brought it to our notice and explained the possible complications she did not jump to any action, only when she observed that my AFI(Water Levels) was contineously dropping after a couple of weeks, she asked me to go for NVD by inducing.\n\nWhen I got admitted and pains were induced, I took pains for several hours without my cervix opening much, I asked the the doctor that I wont have enough strength to push the baby if pains are increased further, doctor actually stopped the pain induction allowed me to have foods and recover my strength and sleep till next early morning, when she resumed inducing the pain. In this whole process we had lost hopes since during my first time I experienced that inducing could lead to C-sec or use of instruments while birthing. So we were constantly asking doctor if we should go for C-sec directly. But Doctor had full confidence in her experience and me too and hence she encouraged me in every possible way for NVD and mentioned that we will try for NVD till the end. Only because of this I could gather all my strength and deliver baby normally under her guidance. Thanks to my doctor. \n\nLast but not the least the staff of Dr. Sangeeta (Special thanks to Dr Shweta who helped me deliver without Epidural, Sisters, Nurses- special thanks to Babitha, OnCall Doctors) were as patient and professional as we could expect as a patient. Also would like to mention about Dr Shweta, Atlast stage of my delivery I felt that I would not be able to endure any pains further and asked for Epidural. But Dr Shweta encouraged me for delivering without epidural since I was already in the last phase of delivery and could deliver at any time now. She and the Nurse (I am extremly sorry since I forgot her good name) gave me all kind of comfort level and their words and faith in me helped me in deliverying a healthy baby normally. \n\nDr Sangeeta Gomes is the best Doctor. Thank you for all your support. ",

It's been a great journey for me from the day my wife got conceived till the time we first saw our little prince with Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. Living away from parents and in laws ...Dr. Sangeeta guidance throughout the journey and the kind of care she took was great. \non the day when I got to know that my wife  got conceived , we just walked into Dr. Sangeeta Gomes clinic in HSR  layout, which is like my next door in the never changing Bangalore traffic. While we got our turn to meet the doctor, I was going through reviews about Dr. Sangeeta Gomes on practo and Google. That reviews about the doctor gave us a sigh of relief that we were in right place, right hands and lot of our time got saved in searching for a right doctor in a city like Bangalore. She cleared all our doubts with lot of patience and added reasoning for each and every suggestion of hers. She was very particular about the diet a pregnant woman should take and we did follow her strictly and the outcome was a healthy baby of ours. Let me quote with an example on her diet suggestion, looking at my wife\u2019s weight growth during first few 3months of pregnancy, doctor suggested her to stop having milk and asked her to have only 3 fruits per week. This was a great surprise to our parents and in-laws, started asking us to consult a different doctor as generally all kinds of fruits and milk would be the best diet every person believe once a woman is pregnant. But we followed doctor suggestion in all the diet plan she suggested. Diet plan differs from person to person and that doctor only could tell depending on the patient response.  Our journey was smooth and once during our consultation post 30 weeks, she has predicted the baby weight depending on the latest ultra sound scan and gave us confidence of normal delivery. To our surprise on our 9th month scan it was detected that baby has loop around the neck and doctor has suggested to go for c-sec as might get complicated during vaginal delivery, explaining us different angles of her suggestion and left the final decision to us. According to our decision we waited for normal delivery, but one evening uneasiness in the stomach led us to her clinic and the test that she did that night showed that baby heart beat dropped and we went for emergency C-section section. \nOn special note I would like to thank care clinic's sisters for their follow-up from the time my wife got admitted to almost a week post discharge from the hospital.\n\n\n",

All this ensured in three months time we had news of confirmed pregnancy to share.\nWe continued to consult for pregnancy as well. Dr.Sangeeta did not take any chances and had us covered from any risks, with the medications and advices. Visiting her at regular intervals helped us in sailing through the months comfortably.\n\u200cIn the last phase, doctor suggested for C-section as the baby was in breach position and there was fluctuations during NST tests. Dr.Sangeeta ensured we had the medication that ensured a healthy baby. The surgery was done at Motherhood. The process in the operation theatre itself took less than 30 minutes, with local anestesia. It was well coordinated, with no pain. Dr.Sangeeta and her team made it all look so easy and made my wife absolutely comfortable. Dr informed we were blessed with baby girl, and then I heard the baby cry for the first time announcing her arrival.. and was introduced to the most adorable baby.\n\u200c\n\u200cThe post surgery process was also well managed by the hospital staff.\n\u200cWith the new phase of motherhood, series of new q's and concerns came up.. which were all addressed by Dr.Sangeeta during her visits or via SMS. She remembers the concerns discussed in earlier communication and will ask about it in the next interaction. Everyday there was follow up from the Care clinics staff, ensuring both mother and baby were doing fine. We are continuing to consult the doctor for post surgery care and find the same expertise.\n\n\u200cDr.Sangeeta's consulting is impeccable. We trust her completely and highly recommend to anyone facing fertility issues or need to consult during pregnancy.\n\u200cShe has been a blessing for us.",

Here whenever we interacted with the doctor or go for scan along with the me my husband was accompanying me, and it was well advised by Motherhood team unlike the team in Sakra where only I could enter the doctor\u2019s room or the scan room. We planned for normal delivery and Sangeeta Mam guided us to follow certain exercises/diet and change in habits to make sure the health of the baby is maintained throughout the pregnancy. Finally, I had normal delivery with a healthy baby. I always had a motherly connection with her and am grateful to have Dr Sangeeta Gomes by my side who ensured a smooth journey throughout my 1st pregnancy.\n",

Our journey through these 9 months has been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes.\nShe is very caring, polite and listens to all the issues patiently.\nWe were never asked to go for any un-necessary tests and  all required test/scan were done on time. She is very flexible and never imposes any restrictions on where the tests or scan should be done. \nShe kept encouraging my wife for normal delivery and even being living alone in bangalore (without parents), we never panicked. \n\nWe got admitted in hospital at 4:30 AM and doctor was quick to reach hospital in no time considering my wife was already 7 cm dilated.\n\nWe never had any availability issues, we were always able to clear our doubts through her care clinic contact no. She generally responds to patients queries via messages.\n\nThe best thing was, even after discharge from hospital, we kept on getting regular calls from care clinic asking about the well being of my wife and baby and in case of any doubts or issues, we got appropriate replies from doctor and same was the case throughout the last 5-6 months of our pregnancy.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied with how things turned out and really appreciate all her effort.\n\nThanks a lot Doctor !!!!!\n\n",

This was our first pregnancy and we were scared as family was not here with us but luckily we got Sangeeta Mam. From the first month of pregnancy, we were consulting with Sangeeta Mam and trusted her completely. Throughout the pregnancy, she suggested normal homely things that anyone can follow easily.*** ***** *********** *********** *********** I was looking for normal delivery so she was preparing me for normal delivery since start. It was not easy for us but mam you made us to feel comfortable & safe.Her staff was very supportive during my labour, all were encouraging me not to give up and supported me in every moment of labour.Finally I had normal delivery which was possible only because of Sangeeta Mam.I would highly recommend everyone who is looking for a genuine doctor, you can blindly trust her and see how miracle happens.Again Thanks a Ton for your support, patience & extraordinary experience.",

She patiently and enthusiastically guided us only with necessary scans and medications. And she was the first doctor who did not ask us to come every week. We only went once every month until 8th month completion. She patiently gave us the reason for each medication and was always a fun and jovial person to talk to. She never forces anything and only gives suggestions. We took all her suggestions and everything went well. At 37 weeks completion, my amniotic fluid was low and doctor suggested c-section. We went ahead with her suggestion (since this was a precious pregnancy for us) and delivered a healthy baby boy on Oct 12 2017. \n\nOne noteworthy aspect of this doctor was how she took efforts to always reduce our medication expenses by reducing medications at right times. \n\nWe would definitely recommend her highly to anyone !",

Based on online reviews we selected Dr Sangeeta.\n\nDuring the course of our 9 months visit Dr recommended diet plan and regularly monitored weight. Many times she raise warnings when she feels like weight is getting increased more than expected. \n\nMy relative's main worry was C-Section delivery will be performed in Bangalore as this is very much common and they wanted us to get our baby delivered in my hometown. Based on our personal needs (regular office and kid's school) we decided that we will be in Bangalore. We dont have choice other than to trust the Dr and follow her instructions. On 14-Sep there was 9th month ultrasound performed and Dr checked and confirmed that based on the reports of tests performed during course of 9 months and current ultrasound its very likely that delivery will be normal and no c-section will be required.  \n\nOn 19-Sep my wife delivered a cute healthy baby girl and it was a normal delivery at Motherhood hospital, Sarjapur road branch. We all were very happy. On 20-Sep based on Dr's recommendation my wife was discharged. Post delivery there was a regular call for 3 days from Care Clinic asking about the condition of mother and baby.\n\nOverall experience was excellent. Me along with my wife and parents were highly satisfied.",

We went to her one year before we started trying and she said I could take all the time I wanted and age wasnt a factor. After the first miscarriage, she said this is normal and told us to try again normally after 3 months. We did that and there was another miscarriage. After which we went to her. To that she lied throughout the consultation. She said we should have gone to her before we started trying and that she could have \"prevented\" this miscarriage. She lied that it was I who had told her not to give me any medicines. And in the end when I asked if age was a problem she said definitely. Not even knowing that she gave completely opposite answers when we went earlier. And to make it worse she started acting, saying \"Sad sad, this could have been prevented. This is so sad\".\n\nIn the end she told us to take tests which were for infertility not miscarriages. She prescribed 4-5 tablets even before the test results came our, without even explaining what those were for. And she demeaned the other doctor we went to during an emergency earlier calling her junior and inexperienced. And she charges randomly. There is no fixed consultation fee. I can show the proofs.\n\nI 100% regret going to her.",

She made sure baby and mother bonding is good by suggesting techniques.\nOverall experience: Excellent ",

I am blessed with a baby boy on March 2017 in Motherhood hospital.\n\nWhen I conceived I met her first time in her clinic. As I was overweight she made me follow proper diet and monitored my weight throughout my pregnancy so that I won't be affected by gestational diabetis. I wanted to deliver normally and she motivated me for the same and also guided me in doing good exercises. She always answers all the doubts and questions.\n\nAfter 9th month when I went for check up my fluid was lower than 6 I.e., it had reached 4.3 which was dangerous for the baby. She immediately asked me to admit in hospital and also she reached hospital immediately.  And through C section I delivered a baby boy and we both are healthy.\n\nShe also visits in hospital post delivery and enquiries your health which is really good thing. Also I got call daily after my delivery for 3 days during my hozpitalization from Care Clinic. They enquired my health and always asked to call them in case if I face any problem. I do recommend Dr.Sangeetha Gomes.",

Everywhere the solution was to go for IUI for 4 cycles & then IVF, prior to IUI we tried multiple cycles with tablets & injections, nothing worked. Finally before trying IVF, we just wanted to consult with Dr.Sangeetha mam once.\nFirst of all we liked her approach with complete positive vibes & the good part was to cross check few important reports to ensure the data is correct. As many doctors with whom we consulted before blindly supported the wrong report provided by the Fortis & suggested treatments accordingly. After which we got to know the AMH (2.1) measured by Fortis was incorrect. With a very healthy AMH level, we were running around with doctors for treatments which are supposed to be followed for a low AMH level patient.\nPost the result, Dr.Sangeetha advised not to go for IUI or IVF with such a healthy AMH (4.1) level, she figured out that there is a minor issue in fallopian tube, which was the problem & with 2 months of treatment, i got Pregnant naturally without any trouble.\nDr.Sangeetha is not at all money minded and she take spends enough time with each patient and clarifies every doubts. She is very friendly and takes good care of patients and make them very comfortable.",

Initially I had spotting, thankfully nothing went wrong and doctor treated to in clotting of the blood. And 20th week scan confirmed restricted blood flow. I was asked to take rest and Dr.Sangeetha prescribed few medicine to increase the blood flow. Gradually blood flow was normal with one artery. My 37th week scan stated that there is a cord around the neck of the baby and the liquor quantity too had decreased. Doctor explained the completion of waiting for normal delivery, yet she insisted us to take a call, whether to go for c-section or to wait for normal delivery, for which she had to monitor to ensure baby is safe. We didn't wanted to take chance as doctor had told the complication which would arise if we wait. It was the wise decision as baby had consumed meconium and liquor quantity was very less. I delivered healthy baby boy on September 12th 2016. Doctor was constantly in touch with me making sure me and my baby are doing well. Though the circumstances were not favorable she visited us in hospital and helped me to feed baby, which was challenging task initially. Me and my family are thankful to her for making my pregnancy go smoothly and for insisting the best hospital for delivery. I strongly recommend Dr.Sangeetha for infertility treatment and Pregnancy.",

After checking in with a few neighborhood doctors, we settled with Dr Sangeetha. She makes you feel comfortable and does'nt create undue fear/panic. A lot of unnecessary worries arise during pregnancy due to the body changes happening and all need a an expert hand and a healing touch, this is where her experience and confidence came in extremely handy. We never had to undergo unnecessary scans and tests or bear any extra costs and everything we did was well explained per the rule book. You always feel more assured after every visit since a lot of things she could say by visual observation and touch.\nSince the basic nursing facilities (for iron drips/other common  injections in pregnancy) are within the clinic, you dont need to be admitted to a hospital and the whole process is really hassle-free.\nThe recommended hospital (Motherhood) was one of the better experiences we could have expected(much better than the one in our first child ) and given that other friends had reported bad experiences with other hospitals in Bangalore. We got real professional support during delivery and an extremely cosy and comfortable place for post-recovery.\n\nWould highly recommend Dr Sangeetha and Motherhood hospital to anybody staying in HSR Layout/Sarjapur Road/Koramangala and nearby surroundings.",

I consulted Dr.Sangeetha Gomes in her clinic \"Care Clinic\" in HSR layout. First consultation at her clinic gave us lot of confidence. She understands the patients problems and addresses it in a very friendly and amicable manner. She answered all our queries with lot of patience. When we started trying for a baby, I got to know that I had hypothyroid, pcod and bicornuate uterus. She suggested to get HSG test to ensure there were no blocks in my tubes. She treated me for tubal infection for 4 weeks. After that i conceived in the first cycle itself. I was panic when i saw spotting in my 6th week. She explained the problem, prescribed few injections as a precautionary measure. She is experienced and easy-handler in any critical situations. With the help of regular checkups, proper scans and blood tests, my pregnancy under her is going smooth and heading towards due date.\n\nI would like to convey my sincere regards and thanks to her!!!\n",

She is highly experienced in a way that she was even able to tell me my haemoglobin count just looking at my tongue :) (I confirmed this after my blood test later :) ).\r\n\r\nI had few niggles initially but was promptly solved by her. I had to deliver my baby in the 37th week due to some complications and had to go for a c-sec. Dr. Sangeetha promptly addressed this issue and my baby was delivered with a healthy weight. \r\n\r\nI always wanted a Normal delivery to which Dr. always encouraged me to do so my doing proper exercises and walk which helps for normal delivery. Though I could not not take the risk of normal delivery in my case but at the end, everything was good and I am recovering well.\r\n\r\nShe is very strict when it comes to you or your Baby's health and would sometime remind you of your old school strict PT teacher. But That really helps you to be disciplined and achieve a fruitful result.\r\n\r\nI wish her all the very best and would for sure recommend her anytime.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nShradha Singh :)",

Baby weight was 2.89 kg, baby position was vertical with head down and we were told by Dr Sangeetha Gomes till last day that it is a perfect case for normal delivery. Labour pain started naturally and we  reached hospital within 10 minutes since labour pain started. When we reached hospital, water discharge was minimal and labour pain was usual but Dr Sangeetha Gomes visited hospital almost after 5 hours. For first five hours, it was taken care buy less expertise doctor and nurses. They didn't try for normal birth at all and intentionally didn't use injection to handle labour.\r\nAfter 5 hours Dr Sangeetha Gomes reached hospital and as soon as she entered in labour room, she started pressurizing us for surgical. Doctor misbehaved with us and we were handled unprofessionally.\r\nThey called Dr Swapnil for final scan again who told baby position has been changed but never shared the scan report even after asking multiple times.\r\nI complained the incidence to hospital management Mr Anand but nothing worked out.\r\nFinally they went through surgical for a normal case. We were there for 3 days and saw multiple deliveries but none of them were normal.\r\nThese people are big time frauds with unprofessional attitude and they can cross all the limits for making more money.\r\nPlease don't think of visiting motherhood if you care for your family.",

We have been visiting Dr. Sangeetha Gomes since a year and have no words to show how grateful we are towards her, for all the timely help she has extended.\nAm 6 months pregnant now and i owe it all to the efforts of our beloved doctor.She provided the right kind of guidance , support and advice \nand always ensures that the medical help she extends to all her patients worth every penny they spend.She values our time, money and never boggs you down  with late waiting hours,unnecessary tests or medications.She provided us with apt medicines for our case, that helped the cause.  Whenever we needed her, she was there by our side and i would call her our second mother. Every time we had doubts/confusions/pains , she was there and mere visiting her , gave us immense confidence , that we are in the right hands.She knows each of her patients personally and her treatment is compared to none. She made our 6 months of journey through pregnancy smooth and comfortable. At this point, i only wish that, i could have her beside me at my delivery. I wish her journey continues and her service extends to many more generations to come. It is too little to say Thank You Doctor!",

Before each visit I use to  have so many questions in my mind and she use to answer my each and every question so patiently.\n                 She has given me proper guidelines on which medicine to take and which all scan I should do. Also I use to ask each and every medicine details and that also she use to explained me very patiently.\n                When ever I visited hospital I feel like I am a patient but she will always say that you are not a patient so be happy and stress free.\nAs mental patience is very important in the entire journey of pregnancy. Sometimes she use to share her own experience of motherhood journey which give so much energy as well as confidence. I personally like the Straight forward nature of Dr. Sangeetha.\n\nThank you so much doctor for all your support in my entire journey of motherhood.\n\nI will recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes ...",

In a high risk pregnancy there is proper counselling & follow-up required which we didn\u2019t get from my last doctor. Here we got very good proper counselling & follow-up from doctor very frequently on the patient status which helped us in terms of understanding things, getting confident and not taking undue tension. My baby was born pre-term as mentioned before due to some pregnancy  complications but doctor gave us proper counselling on all the aspect of early delivery like if there is any risk involving in early delivery, clearing all our doubts and queries regarding delivery & what could be the side effects if we dont go for early delivery. When we were fully confident & mentally ready then only she went for delivery & post delivery i could see that it was a very good decision to go for the preterm delivery else there would have been some problem with the baby. Baby and mother are both doing good now and being released from hospital.\n\nEven though we approached her just 14 days before the delivery, she has been extremely pleasant with us and we would recommend Dr Sangeetha Gomes to anyone willing to extend their family.. \ud83d\ude0a",

I consulted her in the middle of my pregnancy and she has been very supportive all the way, clarified all the concerns that one may have regarding pregnancy or any related queries and provided guidance which help me a lot. She told some home remedies and would encourage to follow them, avoiding the unnecessary medicines where required.\n\nDuring the last stage of my pregnancy, my AFI went very low and her experience helped to identify the same, suggested for an immediate scan and proceed with Caesarean to ensure the safety of baby. Also she ensured all the necessary care is taken for recovery post delivery as well.\n\nNeedless to say, I would strongly recommend Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. She is simply one of the best doctor i have come across and a very BIG THANK YOU to her for such a wonderful experience.",

I followed little harder for diet and compulsory tablets given by her. \n\nI had a lose a hope due to fail treatments before, my hubby had very positive hope on Doctor Sangeeta and whenever we met her she told us it will happen very soon. She discuss very calmly and very friendly to us. So the day is come. I am pregnant since 2months.\n\nThis is my first review about a Doctor, but I will strongly recommend her she is the best doctor I have met in entire life, she is very friendly, supportive Doctor.  She gives very good treatment, and needed tests and scan if at all needed.\n\nBy grace of GOD and Doctor Sangeeta I am pregnant and taking pregnancy check-up. Me and hubby are happy that our dream has come true.",

Her vast experience speaks ** *** ********* and comfortability she provides to her patients. Her clinic is also equipped with the right staff and medication and medical instruments to provide easy diagnosis. Though my pregnancy was smooth through the early months, during my 34th week when we did the NST test doc suspected that the fetal heartbeats were high. She again asked me to do are test in the 35th week. Her clinic is equipped with the NST machine which helps us to test the fetal heartbeat without going to any diagnosis clinic. When there was no change in the situation during the late 35th week Dr Sangeeta advised us to go for a C sec for the benefit of the baby and myself. We then got ourselves admitted at Motherhood hospital and delivered a healthy baby boy. Though he was a pre-term baby the doctors and the nurses monitored him quickly to recovery. Dr Sangeeta and her staff were continuously monitoring the situation and guiding me through lactation and recovery advise. She and her staff kept close contact with me even post discharge. They are always available on calls and provide a personal touch to our relationship. I highly recommend her for any gynae and obstetrics related treatments. I have a special mention to her staff who are very friendly, supportive and approachable during all times.",

I started getting regular call from the clinic regarding update on my health conditions. \n\nIn third trimester of pregnancy, i had cholestasis of pregnancy.

But was pointing in different locations. She couldn't capture the heartbeat and yet left. Even the doctor didn't bother to check for the heartbeat. She just came and grabbed my baby here or there. She was constantly saying that my current doctor is naive and is giving me wrong advice. But when it came to her, she started changing her words. She claimed that she delivered 5 babies by normal delivery. *** *** ** ** ****** *** ******** *** **** ******** *** *** * ********* ******** ***** ******* ** ****** ***** *** **** ****** *** **** ***** *** ********** *** ****** **** *** ****** **** *** ********* **** ** ***** ** *** **** ** *** **** ** **** **** * ***** **** *** *** ******** *** ****** ** *** ********* ***** ***** **** * ***** ** * ******* *** ***** **** **** **** ****** ******* ** ****** **** ** ***** *** **** ****** ***** **** ***** *** ********** ** *** **** ** ****** ******* ** ****** ***** I strongly advise that no one should visit this doctor *** **********",

She prescribed all necessary tests and suggested to go for IUI without any delay since my AMH level was low. I also had a subcerosal fibroid. My confidence started decreasing thinking that there might be issues and my pregnancy might be delayed. But Dr Sangeetha was so confident and made it look like such an easy thing to achieve and that definitely increased my confidence and started the whole process with a positive attitude. I was conceived in the second cycle of IUI. From that moment till my delivery, Dr Sangeetha and team were with us. We were able to consult her without much delay and she even answered all the queries by phone as well. Its difficult for a busy doctor like Dr Sangeetha to take out some time from her schedule and be reachable on phone. During my pregnancy journey there were difficult times due to issues with my fibroid and she was concerned about preterm delivery chances. She suggested complete bed rest and gave all necessary injections to prevent any chance of contractions and also for faster lung development of the baby. During the later stages, NST started showing variations frequently and she suggested immediate delivery due to foetal tachycardia. I was panicked since i hadn't given much thought about my delivery untill then. But i took some time and convinced myself to trust her and proceed with delivery. I gave birth to a baby girl in August and she is my everything now. I would have gone through anything to have her in my hands. Dr Sangeetha couldn't visit us in hospital everyday after my delivery since she was down with fever. She contacted me via phone and gave all the instructions. The care clinic team contacted me everyday even after my delivery to make sure we are doing fine. My sister was also consulting Dr Sangeetha had her delivery at Motherhood hospital. I thank Dr Sangeetha for all the help and care throughout my journey. I also thank the team at care clinic and all staff nurses of Motherhood Hospital Sarjapur for their kindness and sincerity. I was able to give birth at Motherhood hospital with ease and i am happy that i chose Dr Sangeetha and Motherhood hospital for this most important time of my life.",

She didn't even talk to us for 2 mins.  Asked us to get scanning done and meet her again with reports in her HSR layout clinic. Same story again in her HSR layout clinic, waited for an hour to show the reports instead of seeing the report she started scolding saying why did you take appointment for showing report? That meeting was all about she scolding us more than seeing the report.  Saw report for a min started telling you have bleeding and baby's heartbeat is less get the scanning done again after 12days and asked me to take an injection weekly once for 6 weeks.on asking why injection I get reply from nurse saying since you are pregnant we are giving you injection.  That doctor makes sure that we will buy injection from her pharmacy and the nurses make sure that they will charge us 1k per visit.  I got the scanning done again this time waited for 2 days to show the report. 3rd time since I could not go at 4.30 in the evening my in-laws took the report to her. Instead of seeing the reports she starts to scold my in-laws again. My in-laws asked her that I'm getting tired because of the injection why are you giving? She rudely replies if you want you take but never says why injection.

Before conceiving she makes sure that all tests are done and in my case my AMH was reducing due to which she suggested us to have the baby soon,few tablets were given and I got conceived within 2 months.A fter conceiving entire 9 months she gave proper dates for tests and scans along with good amount of tablets.When I was in my 8th month through scanning we  came to know that my water  level is reducing ,she gave 1 week treatment by giving fluids and injections and I was under  constant observation.After a week of the treatment when I had completed 31 weeks my NST was improper and got admitted to motherhood,we almost thought at that moment I will get delivered at that time when the baby was just 1.6kg,but Dr. sangeetha gomes was a game changer at the last moment where she chose for a second opinion for scanning and luckily over there my water level was normal and I was sent home.With all the complications like being diabetic,water level probelm and being O-ve we thought there won't be any chance for normal delivery,but Dr sangeetha gomes told me that it is possible and with keen observation she made a great choice and pushed us for normal delivery.For delivery motherhood hospital had a wonderful team and Dr sangeetha gomes made sure I was monitored well and then I had a successful normal delivery.Even after the delivery Dr sangeetha gomes observed a cyst which was damaged during the delivery when the baby was pushed out and she fixed the same within no time.For all those who are trying  for a baby and in search of a good doctor in Bangalore I would like to suggest Dr sangeetha gomes because of her great decision making process,positivity, perfect monitoring throughout the pregnancy for a smooth delivery.*** ** *** **** .You yourself will feel that you have made the right choice by choosing her as your doctor.

I believe in her and followed her all advice for diet and exercises through out my pregnancy. I have delivered baby boy with normal delivery on 13th July 2023. She prescribes medicines only if required otherwise she recommends home remedies for some issues like gastric and loose motions.\n\nAlso, I used to get calls from her every day for my and my baby\u2019s health checkup during my hospital stay. \nWe were very relaxed and comfortable with this doctor.

We consulted two other doctors, underwent tests but it did not help and were scared with medical jargons.\nOn a friend's advice we consulted Dr. Sangeeta. In the first consulting, she listened to our concerns, checked the tests and provided us with a clear direction on how she will be addressing it. We went for few follow up sessions, during which she gave a complete picture of where we stood, the reason for the tests to take, well explained the results and accordingly how the medications will help. She is also accessible via SMS, and responds in few minutes. Most importantly, she exuded hope and positivity, which I believe is very important. In few months, we were blessed with the news of a new member joining us and we are currently consulting her on this journey of pregnancy.\nDr. Sangeeta is someone to go to for any fertility/pregnancy related issues. We can vouch for her approach and trust her completely. The Care clinic at HSR is well managed by her team of nurses, who are ever enthusiastic to support.\n\nThanks,\nPriti\n",

I had put in my comments on our early pregnancy days and today I echo every bit of it. I thank Almighty for introducing her to us (we were just walking across her clinic frustrated not having a kid and we saw her board and walked in). The whole pregnancy experience has been absolute. A real and spontaneous attitude. She gave us a reason to live yesterday. We  had our baby in the most ambiguous and challenging times.\n\nWe are not doctors and we go to doctors since they are subject matter experts and we need to trust their advice else, situations and lives can get complicated. We reached Dr. Gomes in the most bizarre circumstance and she as a good doctor explained the situation to us. She gave the choice to go for normal or C section and never pressurized us for C section.We selected C section after enough interviewing with the doctor and we were convinced that for us it was the way forward. \n\nMy wife delivered our life yesterday and she is already walking. A bundle of joy is breathing in rhythm with us and Dr. Sangeetha Gomes made it happen. I have been supremely successful in my career but was living a life without meaning. Dr. Gomes gave me a new life and purpose to me and my family and hence I say she is part of my family. Thank You Doctor for being part of our lives\n",

I agree that I couldn't report on time, but when I checked in the reception they allowed me to proceed with the billing and to consult the doctor.  And I waited till 11.45 am. The nursing staff did the BP and weight checkup. When I entered the doctor's room around 12 pm she denied to consult me saying that I am late. But the way she denied duty is bit arrogant and insulting which I didn't expect from a reputed doctor.\nI visited the doctor after going through the practo  feedbacks only, and I didn't expect this sort of an approach from her. I appreciate her punctuality , but being a doctor some humanity is also expected.\nI explained her that I took leave at my work place and came , and I have been waiting  for more than 1 hour but she didn't consider. \n\nThe hospital and nursing staff  apologized to me *** *** ******** *** **** *** ******* **** *** ** **** **** ***** I would like to thank the hospital management and nursing staff for helping me to get the refund. But this was my first bad experience with a doctor.\n\nIIUC the 4th one in the Hippocratic oath is\" I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemists drug. \"\n*** *** **** ********* ** * **** ***** ****** ***** *** ** ***** ********** *** ****** ****",

Under her care we were able to  go through our first pregnancy despite significant fibroid growth. By 32nd week, the fibroids had grown to 3.5 kgs and were degenerating which led to preterm labor. Her team was able to safely delivery my baby and successfully extract the fibroid without any complications during the surgery.  Fibroid removal has significantly improved my back pain. We would highly recommend Dr. Sangeeta and her team based on how well they managed each and every complication that came our way.",

Doctor also makes sure not to prescribe a lot of medicines and believes in home remedies and traditional methods. She made sure baby weight was not on high end by guiding me to maintain my diet.

Out of my experience I can say the name \u201cCARE\u201d is the apt name as they really do care about your health and need. \n\nDr. Sangeeta is extremely positive & she will answer to your every question with a lot of patience. In first month of treatment under Dr. Sangeeta\u2019s supervision, I got pregnant. I fell short of words to thank her.\n \nIf you are facing any gynae problems, she is the one who will take you out of it. ",

Though this can be stressful sometimes, it helped us to be careful when it was needed.\n\nAny problems/complications in pregnancy were proactively handled by her through prescription of proper course of treatments. Her 20+ years of experience shows during such times.\nI should say that my second baby was born safe and sound because of her timely treatment of complications that arose.

Some of the docs used to scare us asking the planning was so late and age (30+)would be a barrier .The whole approach was negative or many of them were so casual & money minded. But when we started interacting with Ms Gomes , she was very positive. She had always supported for a good lifestyle and always given a go ahead whenever we approached her. Many a times it was the motivation for which we had been to her since as a working couple time becomes a challenge many a times.The best thing is that I never felt panicked by the doctor .Today I am almost done with my 1st trimester of pregnancy and till now she has been very supportive & gives you a lot of energy. Many thanks to her. I would definitely recommend her",

She was friendly and explained us the problem in detail. She also had a structured plan to diagnose me and to ensure I dont get ectopic pregnancy again in future. With all the tests and treatment, I was able to conceive 3 months back. I am thankful to Dr Sangeetha Gomes who not only treated me but also supported me when i was demotivated. She is truly an expert in treating Ectopic pregnancy cases and would strongly recommend anyone with similar issues to visit her.         ",

We had consulted many doctors over the course of 6 years of our married life (at least 8 - 10) for PCOS / PCOD but never get over it. we heard about madam through one of our relatives and consulted her at care clinic. \n\nShe had examined all our previous reports and suggested us the medication ******* tailor made for me to overcome PCOS to become pregnant just in the 2nd cycle of my treatment. She studied the follicle growth and cysts in the ovary to the least level of detail,  I'm now a 3 month pregnant and grateful  to Sangeeta madam for the way she treated us.\n\nWould take this opportunity to recommend madam for all who has PCOS / PCOD and also with different infertility problems.\n\nThanks, Keerti.",

It sounded me very cool sometime as her replies looked carefree but when required she  gave strict instruction as well, like for diet, baby weight and exercises for normal delivery. I had finally a normal delivery during 37th week only in March 2017 and in the labor room also, she was very encouraging. \nCare clinic timings was also very helpful for me as I could visit for regular checkups while coming back from office.\nThank you Dr Sangeeta for this wonderful experience, will always remember your words \"Himanchali, dekho ladka hua hai\" . :-)",

She keeps informing about the issues/complications one may face during different phases in pregnancy and help avoid anxiety. She is also very particular about the arrangements for her patients in hospital. We selected  Motherhood, Sarjapur for delivery and had a smooth delivery experience under Dr. Sangeeta Gomes.  ",

She has guided us before and during pregnancy, taking every detail of my health into consideration. She speaks positive and her assurance is like crossing a milestone. She identified the need of a cervical stitch for me and it was neatly done at the right time. When my due date was fast approaching, she used to give me a call to check if everything was fine with me. The nurses at her clinic are good and soft-spoken. The doc even guided us to the right hospital for confinement and made sure that hospital staff does a regular check. Thank you doc. May you be a blessing to many more couples.",

Her first focus was on making us comfortable, which scored a lot of points with my wife. We could drop by her clinic or call her to have our doubts clarified. The best part was that we were informed of our choices and pros and cons of everything clearly.

She was encouraging throughout this period. She was always available to talk if I needed her. Finally I completed my 38 weeks and during my delivery as well she was cheering me up as I was totally nervous. She held my baby and showed to me it was overwhelming. She made sure I get the best treatment even during my stay in hospital and she called in everyday till today when my son is 10 days old to ensure we are doing fine.\n\nI would recommend Dr Sangeetha to everyone who want to enjoy there pregnancy. She is amazing with her attitude, she is highly experienced. Very open to discuss and guide and super friendly!!",

From the first day she was quite friendly and always talks to patient with a smiling face. She is always approachable. She did not prescribe any unnecessary tests to me. I delivered a baby girl at 36th week of my pregnancy and she performed the C section quite smoothly. During my stay at the hospital she personally came to see how I was doing. Moreover she also advised me on prenatal exercises and lactation.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the doctor and my husband and I would like to thank Dr. Sangeetha for our wonderful experience.\n",

During my entire pregnancy period Dr. Sangeetha has attended all my health issues very calmly and her advises were really helpful. As she was not available in Motherhood for all the time, we visited  her clinic at HSR layout during some emergency. \"Care Clinic\" staffs are trained and they paid immediate attention towards us. Dr. Sangeetha was very much cooperative during the delivery time to choose the right hospital looking at our economic condition, also she suggested us couple of options. She completed the whole process without any complication and thus blessed us with a second child after a daughter, we are very thankfull to her. During the entire period we were not worried as we are under supervision of such an experienced  doctor.      ",

May it be the problem related to menstural cycle or the problem in bowel movement, her treatment helped me a lot. When we started to try for a baby, I got to know that I had hypothyroid and PCOD, Dr.Sangeeta Gomes started treatment for the same and insisted to get follicular scanning. I conceived in the second month of her treatment. I had spotting on 6th week of my pregnancy, fortunately nothing was wrong as per scan, she treated me to clot the blood and now I'm 3.5 months pregnant. My experience with her has been great. Looking forward to have safe delivery and healthy baby under her guidance.",

She brought my Son into this world and i am so thankful to her!! My stitches were also healing rapidly! There was hardly any pain. Even when I consulted her after 2 weeks for follow up, she was kind enough to guide me in how to maintain my health and take care of the stitch.

She is straight forward and does not keep the patient waiting. She is on time. Does not prescribe unnecessary medications. Her advice on diet and fitness  will be magical if u follow. Unlike most of the pregnancy experts i have met earlier, she is the only Doctor who reminded me of the Doctor's i used to meet during my younger days. Finally, choosing this Doctor is the best decision of my life. We are now blessed with a baby boy. Thank you for the hands which helped my baby come into this world. ",

She is very friendly and treats her patients like her daughter.Now a days Hospitals make good money if you consult them for infertilty, as theses are very common in Bangalore but She is not someone who is back of money.In one line I can say\"God works through her\".May this review be helpful for those who is struggling to convinve.",

There were a few lows in between and doctor guided us all along and was patient enough to answer our queries. Make sure you jot down the questions to be asked before the consultation as she is busy with a lot of patients in the queue. It was my first baby and my overall experience was great. Post pregnancy as well doctor is available to answer your queries. She is approachable and answers all your queries. Also her warm and friendly nature will make you more comfortable. Further, her staff at Care Clinic is also very friendly. I recommend Dr Sangeeta Gomes to all pregnant woman. Happy delivery! ",

I am extremely happy that I started consulting with her and hope to have a great experience henceforth too.

She is very confident, soft spoken, friendly and very comforting\nat all times we met her.  Few of my friends suggested me to go for other doctors but I was really impressed by her way she made me comfortable.  \nShe is very proactive in terms of checking the health of the baby and mother and never compromises on that front which is a very impressive quality I noticed. \n\nDuring the delivery - the instructions given by her to the nurses at all times were very crisp and clear, they were all time alert and did not have any sort of confusion. \nDr Sangeetha, arrived just on time and made it quick and easy on us. \n\nI would strongly recommend her and give her a 10/10. \n\nSabiha Ahmed.",

Our son was born through normal delivery without any complications. Throughout the maternity phase, she has been very clear with her communication. Her calm, composed attitude throughout the 9 months consultation helped us first-time expecting parents stay relaxed. She told us earlier on that we were very favorable for normal delivery and that the labor would be for short and smooth. That is what exactly happened. She was even very supportive when we told her that we would like to wait for natural labor to begin instead of going for induction. Post-delivery as well, there was regular follow-ups from her team to check if I and the baby are doing okay.\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr Sangeeta to all expecting parents. So glad we made the right choice when it came to the happiest experience of our life!",

She immediately took proper attention and suggested us to get admitted, and with proper care and her daily consulting and guidance, i recovered and got back to normal. She knew that we were travelling to our hometown for the delivery, and still she took care of me well, and made sure, we traveled to my hometown on time after being fit. The best experience i ever had consulting a doctor so far. I suggest you all to consult this doctor for any pregnancy related issues or guidance based on my wonderful experience.",

She told us many home/remedies which helped. One thing I really appreciate/like about her is that she won't give medicine for everything and will suggest you to try natural things. My first kid was born using vaccum. She made sure and kept assuring us that we won't use vacuum as it is unsafe. And finally I had a normal delivery without vaccum. Thanks to Doctor for guiding us. She is very friendly. She always has a smile on her face which makes you very comfortable. One more positive point is in the morning she is available in Motherhood and evening at her clinic.

Test was positive and we loved interation with doctor Sangeetha Gomes and decided to continue treatment with her. She was very friendly, always gave proper suggestion in each phase of pregnancy.Care clinic is clean and staffs are also very good. At 7th month of pregnancy I got preterm pain, we informed same to doctor at night. She was quick to respond in night,  asked us to get admit in motherhood hospital and gave treatment to avoid preterm, with that I was able to deliver full term baby.We are really thankful and amazed by doctor. Her experience, patience and interation is commendable. Will surely recommend Sangeetha Gomes to all new mommies.",

At the first meeting itself, after listening to my entire history and some preliminary tests, she laid down a plan for us. Best part it didn't involve expensive medicines or tests, it. Only involved some vitamins. After just 3 months of visiting and following her medication I was able to conceive. Things that I love about her is - she wastes no time in deciding what needs to be done, she is Patient and she understands your part of the story instead of pushing something on you. The staff at her clinic is adept and polite. At no point during the past 4 months we felt uncomfortable/confused. She is no doubt talented in her domain, but what separates her is the humane side she brings to the table. For folks seeking advice on pregnancy/fertility or any other disorders she is the one you should visit. Thanks Sangeeta mam for all your care",

Suggested a very good pediatrician and very good hospital with NICU facilities. The stitches after the C-section were healed faster. Its been 2 years, there has been no issues w.r.to the surgery performed by Dr.Sangeeta.\nI would definitely recommend her and would consult if needed in future.",

The thing I most appreciate about Dr. Gomes was her cool demeanor and friendliness when consulting. She was very clear from the starting about aiming for a vaginal delivery and kept me  on track for that. Her expertise was most visible during her delivery of my child which could have easily been complicated, but for her quick and cool responses and reactions. Thank you for being so awesome Dr. Gomes!",

My grandmother had a tumour and there was no other way to remove it, apart from undergoing a surgical procedure. Performing a hysterectomy on a 77 year old was a critical procedure. Dr. Sangeetha not only treated her with medicines, but also showed us the right direction in terms of further treatment. She stood by us since day 1 to the last of the surgery. Even post surgery, she made sure she is updated with how the patient is doing. Can't thank her enough! My 77 year old got discharged in 1 and half day and, from the 3rd day onwards, she was back to good health, living her life the normal way! All thanks to Dr. Sangeetha.",

We had a wonderful experience with her and my wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl through LSCS @ Motherhood. Her staff keeps on calling you before and after the delivery asking for the well being and further instructions to be followed. I would recommend her to people with high risk pregnancy.  She is a multilingual person and that helps patients who can speak only in their mother tongue and not in English. She also helps you to get Urgent scans done at Motherhood without prior appointment due to her strong rapport with the hospital staff. We are thankful to her for taking us through the wonderful journey of Pregnancy to Parenthood. ",

Her simplicity to solutions and her reasoning behind situations convince you that she is the best in the profession.\r\nYou look up to a doctor not to just medicate but also explain you what is happening with your system - and she is certainly the one who will make you understand.

With no positive signs, we were in a confused state on what the exact issue was. We consulted Dr. Sangeeta. In the first consulting, she listened to our concerns, checked the tests and provided us with a clear direction on how she will be addressing it. We went for few follow up sessions, during which she gave a complete picture of where we stood, the reason for the tests to take, well explained the results and accordingly how the medications will help. Most importantly, she exuded hope and positivity, which I believe is very important. In 1 months, we were blessed with the news of a new member joining us and we are currently consulting her on this journey of pregnancy.\nDr. Sangeeta is someone to go to for any fertility/pregnancy related issues. We can vouch for her approach and trust her completely. The Care clinic at HSR is well managed by her team of nurses, who are really helpful, friendly & enthusiastic to support.\n\nThanks,\nMallika",

Her diagnosis, attention to detail, medication and homely suggestions make you feel more confident and assured that you are in best medical hands for your pregnancy and delivery related issues. \n\nShe has always been able to help us relate any issues with real world examples from her experience and has advised us on next steps which are minimal, yet effective and most importantly pocket friendly. She really ampathises with the patient and provides them the best solution to any problem. Though we conceived 8 months post reaching her out, we never felt we were in wrong hands as her association is so practical and moral boosting. \n\nWe had a successful delivery few weeks back, thanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes.

She just suggested few precautions to take for next few weeks and kept asking us if you have any questions? She then asked us to come after 15 days for scan (again, blood test is yet to be taken and still no confirmation on my pregnancy from doctor). the report took 2 days to come which we took it to doctor expecting atleast now she will confirm. once again, to our surprise she asked us why did you come now and you should have come directly after getting scan results.

We are satisfied with her treatment. She tries to communicate in patients mother tongue for better understanding.\nDr had a very systematic approach towards my entire journey. She is very experienced and understands the signals quite early. \nAssessing the situation, she used to suggest the intake of diet and exercises for normal delivery.  Till last minute it was good to go with normal delivery, but I didn't get pains even on 40th week. April 16th was the expected delivery as per the previous scan and Dr suggested to wait till 14th April for pains and get the scan on 14th. In report it showed baby weight as 3.7 kilos and a loop of the cord to neck. So Dr suggested us to go with C-Sec which is safe for both me and baby to avoid any sort of complications especially during lock-down time. She asked to join by night so that she can operate on next day early hrs to avoid any sort of infections(This shows how much she cares about mother and baby). Post delivery also her suggestions were very good. She takes utmost care and avoids any sort of risk (she will not let us go unnecessarily even for medicine unless until its very imp as its corona time). \n\nWe are very happy with the doctor and treatment. I would strongly recommend her for pregnancy related issues.",

Then we heard about Dr. Sangeeta Gomes and decided to consult her. I guess it was the best decision we made after a while. Doctor listened to all our past treatments very carefully and asked both of us to go for the basic tests again. She then explained us the treatment process in detail and started with medicines to fill in the gap and made us completely healthy and advised a good diet and sleeping plan. She then started medicines for egg development and after 2-3 cycles my wife conceived. We have now completed 3 months and both mother and fetus development are doing good. The doctor is taking good care and prescribing all the required meds and scans on time. She is really a daughter of god for us and brought us out of a very bad nightmare. We could not ask for anything more and hope to have a good delivery with her blessings. Thanks a lot madam for all of your effort and guidance.",

We visited the doctor for 2 months but she did not even gave any medicine. She suggested surgery to treat my endometriosis. I was very worried as the doctor can not guarantee 100% recovery of my endometriosis problem even with the surgery. But as per the suggestion of my friends and family, decided to go for 2nd opinion.\n This time I was very care full in selecting my doctor. After going through the reviews, I decided to consult Dr Sangeetha. She has gone through all my reports and listened to my problem. She assured us that I need not take Surgery for the cyst size I have. Also she educated us with the risks that will arise if I take surgery. She is very friendly and comforting. She gave some medication for me to get pregnant successfully. At the same time, she gave medication to treat my cyst. Within one month I conceived and I can even see that my cyst size is getting reduced. Now I'm Healthy and happy. Thank you so much Doctor!!! \nYou can go to Dr Sangeetha for any Gynic or pregnancy issues without any doubt. I strongly recommend her. One bonus point is she knows many languages. You can comfortably express your problems in your mother tongue.",

Not  a single apparent problem in any of those but still we weren\u2019t conceiving. The previous IUI doc didn\u2019t tell any apparent problem neither did she do any diagnosis after failed first IUI. The second one failed again.  I then decided to go to Dr Sangeeta Gomes for further consultation. She saw the reports and told everything was normal and the only problem which she could think might be related to tubal obstruction.  She gave me inj for 15 days and monitored me closely for the month. With help from her excellent guidance I conceived the same month. It was such a relief from the mental and physical trauma that we were undergoing. I am on my fourth month of pregnancy. She explains everything very nicely. She was bit particular abt diet in the first 3 months and it turned out to be good. She once noticed that I was wearing heels and asked me to change to flats. Which doctor notices such small things \u2026that too outside her clinic. She doesn\u2019t  prescribe any extra test or medicines which is such a relief in this city. Most of the doc bill you before consultation but not her. On many visits she didn\u2019t charge also. The doc has a wonderful grip over languages  and its very easy to have conversation with her. I Hope my remaining pregnancy goes smooth and problem free under her.",

She has handled all the complex situations during my pregnancy very gracefully. She is always approachable through messages and helps us to take right decisions at the right time. Also she actively monitors very minute details and takes timely actions which is very helpful to the mother in delivering a healthy baby. Finally, I would like to thank entire staff for the excellent care received during our visits to the Care Clinic.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr.Sangeetha for the woman!!!",

The baby was delivered by C-section in Fortis where she is a visiting consulting doctor. The Doctor ensured to have regular updates from the hospital doctors and staff on my and my baby's medical condition. \n\nOn a personal note, she is friendly, understanding and supportive. ",

She was very open on discussions and a very positive towards helping us. With only some medicines prescribed by her our reports started showing positive results and in the first round of IUI itself I got pregnant. She was the only confident person throughout our process about the results being positive. \nWe are grateful to her for being a part of our journey. \nI highly recommend her as she is very open to talk to and a very positive person.",

After taking proper medication from her i conceived, after that she suggested me to undergo some tests & scanning in which everything was normal.\nDuring my 28th week of pregnancy i had a short cervix, where doctor advised me to take a complete bed rest and she started giving me injections & medicines. With the help of her guidance & regular check ups & proper scanning everything came to be normal.\nOn may 12th 2016 I delivered a baby boy in Motherhood hospital. I would like to convey my sincere regards & thanks to her\n",

She was approachable and used to listen to us patiently and answer all our queries in a personalised way. She speaks many languages and interacted with us in our language making it even more easy for us to relate and communicate. She always used to give us a lot of confidence.We were on our way to have a normal delivery but a little early than the due date it had to be a C-section. The doctor helped us a lot in making the decision and she ensured the delivery experience was smooth without panic. Thanks to the doctor and I will highly recommend her anytime.",

She has very good hold on traditional & modern methods to guide her patients. The focus is on minimal scanning and more attention to diet and wellbeing. She even engaged with us on couple counseling when needed and devoted dedicated time in managing my pregnancy unlike many other doctors who give very less time to their patients. She meticulously monitored baby weight and kept the same in check through diet and prevented possible gestational diabetes. She is accessible enough for doubts and the nurses in her clinic treated me like family. Most importantly she prepared my mind and body for a smooth labor. Both me and baby are in ideal weight and we are grateful for soliciting her services.",

I will appreciate her staff at care clinic as post delivery they were continuously in touch with me to take the status of my health and updating the doctor and when needed doctor also spoke to us. only one issue I can think of : unable to access doctor directly over mobile as she refrain herself from accessing mobile.  Rest all looks good. Thanks Doctor.",

They consulted many other doctors but finally with dr Sangeeta's guidance and treatment they welcomed a baby boy.\nI was diagonised as pre-diabetic during my early preganacy. She suggested good food habits and fortunately my sugar levels came to normal. We highly recommend Dr. Sangeeta Gomes.\n",

Staff nurses working there are very courteous and very co-operative.  Today we are blessed with a baby boy.  We are grateful to Dr Sangeetha Gomes madam for making this happen.

But our goodness, the first consultation itself, made us to do delivery with her.Dr Sangeetha gomes is really super cool doctor. she didnt recommend much medicines to me. Her advise on food diet and regular scans was really helpful. which is the main reason for me to deliver normally on April 18th 2019. its helpful for me in postpartum advise aswell.we are happy with baby boy.

When so many people visiting daily it would be difficult to remember each person by name and their details but she remembers everything even when we went after my first delivery after so many months she remembered\u00a0us.What we like most about her are the recommendations and suggestions she gave which used to remind us about what our parents or grandparents used to say. When we talk to her we always felt that we are talking to a family friend rather than a doctor in a Q&A session.",

We were unhappy but still thought if the ratings are so good she must be good. we went for 4 other consultation and realised she just doesn't have time to listen. Last to last week we went for consultation and she without seeing my file started writing test which were already done by her 2 month back.She never explained why these test are important. for me it is important to get confidence in the doc and after almost 6 consultation i realise dont go by ratings **** *** **** *** *********** ********* *** ****** ** ** ***",

Ma'am was always available on call/WhatsApp for any issues faced (almost 24/7) even a small query were answered or directed to correct person. I wanted my delivery to be NVD and there was no rush from doctor's end wrt C-section. All scenario while attempting NVD were discussed and explained to us along with the possible complications. Dr. Supported us throughout, resolving all our doubts and helping us in making decisions while attempting the delivery. I am glad that everything went well for us. Also, Dr. Has made sure for all the required care is taken post delivery for good recovery of health and mind for new mother. I am very thankful to ma'am and she is strongly recommended for to-be and new mothers.",

Highly recommend! \nI visited  her when i was looking for baby planning and just lost our first child after one day of birth. Also i had problem of gestational diabetes and low blood pressure in previous preganancy. She encouraged me to plan for baby after 6 months with proper guidance while other doctors asked me to wait for 2~3 years. I also had compilcations like early bleeding, gestational diabetes and less baby growth during pregancy and i got utmost care and positivity from her at every stage of the pregnancy.Also appreciate her staff team members on their support during this period.\n\nI am very thankful to her for her support during entire my pregnancy period (pre-pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery consultation).\n\nI strongly recommend Dr.Dr.SangeethaGomes , you can close your eyes and follow her instructions, I am sure you will not regret because you are for sure in safe hand's.",

However with proper guidance and treatment from the doctor I conceived on Feb 2018. It was a high risk pregnancy due to multiple health issues but With doctors proper prescription, guidance and advice the pregnancy went very smoothly. She got good experience and her confidence brings in more confidence and trust. I totally trusted her and followed her and the result is I delivered a healthy baby girl on Nov 2018. She catches issues very fast and provides the treatment without any delay. The doctor is also very approachable as we can call her assistant any time of the day and the doctor responds immediately. I would definitely refer my friends facing gynec plm to the doctor. ",

I personally like her tips which you can easily do it at home. She had taken care of my wife very well through out the pregnancy. Because of her only the whole pregnancy period went very smooth. Also bcos of her our stay in motherhood was also very good. If you are Dr Sangeeta's patient the staff is giving special attention. She is also monitoring the thing personally. She consoled my wife very nicely. We are blessed with Second baby boy. Thank you Dr for all your help.",

The staff was busy speaking to the other patients and by the time they finished and got to me another 5 mins passed by \nThe staff told me to fill some form and said I need to wait for long as the doc z busy attending other patients and they weren't sure how long it would take. Said half hour to an hour at least. So I decided to leave as it was already too late and I wasn't sure how f long to wait. So I couldn't consult the doc",

Dr very quickly reached diagnosis and prescribed meds. Her treatment seems to be better than the earlier doc I was seeing. No wonder she has so many good reviews online. I am glad I came to her for a second opinion! If I have a grouse I would have liked to have asked her more but couldn't think of anything at the time.  ",
