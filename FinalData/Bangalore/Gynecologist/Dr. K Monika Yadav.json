I met the first doctor who was available at Cloudnine OAR on that particular day, and got an appointment booked for Dr. Monika Yadav. I have heard of women investing time to research and find a good gynecologist who they can connect with. I consider myself very lucky to get a doctor like Dr. Monika. She's very friendly, easy to talk to, would explain in layman's term about anything and everything you want to know from your gynec. My water broke in 34th week and had to be rushed to the hospital late in the midnight. Doc was informed and she came and visited me early in the morning, I think around 5-6 am. I was in pain for close to 18 hours. I almost gave up and was ready to go for a C section for I couldn't bear the pain anymore. But Dr. Monika gave me hope and relief and explained how beautiful and empowering it would feel after a vaginal delivery. She gave me strength and the mental power to endure the pain. I remember I literally called her every hour for some kind of update as I was hanging in pain and she would console me to not give up. And just as she promised, a vaginal delivery indeed was as beautiful as miracle. It sure is painful, but \"beautiful\", how Dr Monika calls it. I believe it all depends on your doc, and your comfort level with them. I would any day give her 10 stars on a rating scale of 5. I'm that happy and satisfied with her.  Dr Monika took such good care of me throughout my 7-8 months of interaction, she felt like family to me. \nTo anyone reading this, she is the gynec you need! \n\n",

Since day one she ensured that we receive all the information pertaining to the process and made extra effort to explain us things that we were not knowing. She became our friend, philosopher and guide during the entire process and thus developed an amazing bond of trust between us. She tries to put emphasis on the natural food habits and exercises to ensure that the baby grows as healthy as possible. Off course there were come complications for my wife but we were explained so well about each and every tests that we had to do or the changes in medication that we had to undergo. She was available over a call/ message always and went out of the way to ensure that we experience and enjoy the entire process together. She is kind, thoughtful and doesn't prescribe unnecessary medications nor does unnecessary scans. We were amazed to see her determination to push us for a Normal Delivery as she thought that was possible. All she asked us was for some time to ensure that my wife gets into labor as naturally as possible. We went through the labor pains, had some agitated moments as it was the first time we were experiencing something like that, but Dr. Monika was there for us always like a guiding force doing what was needed and was right for my wife at that time. \nWe had a healthy baby boy through normal delivery on 14th of Feb 2021 and things went exactly how the doctor had planned for us. We continue to see her for some post natal check ups and will definitely refer her to all our known and unknown ones too. \nShe is the best (Yes we did take second opinions initially just to be sure off and can say this comparing few other doctors) not only because of the profession that she is in but also for the person she is ....smiling, jovial and with loads of patience.\n*** *** **** ****** *** Thank you once again from all of us :)\nRegards\nPratikshya, Baby Arthav and Abhishek",

When we came to know that we are expecting our second child, we were in search of a high risk pregnancy expert as the previous one was a miscarriage in the 20th week. From the very first day, Dr. Monika explained us every minute details regarding the care to be taken. Never subscribed any extra medication. Always with her signature smile, listening to all our queries with utmost patience, given us ample amount of time during each check up. She has gone out of the way to give us her Whatsapp number in case of emergency.  Whenever in doubt, we used to ping her and to our utmost surprise, she always used to reply within minutes. The best thing about her is she remembers every minute details of what you have told her fom the first visit. This made her our friend, philosopher and guide during these crucial 9 months of pregnancy and corona time. I have developed gestational diabetes during my third trimester. She has advised me to send me all sugar readings to her everyday. It helped me to keep on a check regarding my diet. The love, care and affection she has given us in this crucial time is highly appreciated. Her comforting behavior has relaxed me and given me ample amount of strength during the operation time. We were thinking God has came in her form to deliver us our bundle of joy. Se is just an angel in the white apron. Thank you Mam for everything. May the almighty shower his precious blessings on you. Keep spreading the joy. We began as a patient and ended with becoming huge fan of her charisma. \n\nTapan & Ranjita\n\n",

We had experienced preterm miscarriage in 2020. Post which we started consultation with Dr Monika and we did see lot of positivity during the course of our second pregnancy in 2021. Though this time again we had issues of short cervix but with doctor's advice and her pure dedication and true efforts we continued till 34th week and delivered healthy baby boy in jan 2022. On every single occasion where her strict decision had to be made ,she did and that helped seriously for our better being. During entire pregnancy she had been like family member and left no chance to showcase her care and professionalism. Even when my wife was on strict bedrest she managed consultation and checkups at our convenience and without a miss. Her every decision proved fruitful and most accurate. We highly recommend Dr Monika yadav for all sort of pregnancy related advice and consultation. She is gem of a person and posses high skill and extremely great attitude. Thank you so very much Monika maam. Also thanks to cloudnine hospital for having such highly skilled doctors.",

She gave me diet chart and I followed her every word during my pregnancy and I did not have single pregnancy related issue. Monica mam was so much helpful and the day when my water has been broken at 10pm, she asked me to admit in emergency and she also came in hospital within half an hour. And on that day our son Arush born. I recovered very soon and it was happened only for doctor mam. I always got lots of positive energy from her which helped me to heal my wound.

As first time parents to be we had endless lists of questions at every visit and every single time she would take the time to answer each question great patience and a smile. Every time there was a problem, she would be there to ensure everything was sorted. Even regarding scan reports,  blood tests results etc. And she always took the time to follow up on each thing personally. As the date for delivery drew nearer,  we panicked and requested for a C section. But she took the time to convince and counsel both my husband and me to try and do a normal delivery.  Thanks to her I had an almost pain free, beautiful birth experience with the bare minimum pain. Even post birth, she has taken the time to visit us in the room and also follow up personally once we were back home. Apart from her medical expertise,  her bedside manner and emotional support are commendable.  I would highly recommend her. ",

But We are going one step further to also to recommend you as a great Doctor and a extraordinary Human being.\n\nMore than a good doctor, We value the fact that you were a good listener. More than being just professionals, we value the fact that your attitude was exceptional. \n\nThe very thought of hospitalization is scary and traumatizing. But caring doctors like you make it friendly and pleasing. You always treat us as your family. Thanks for your effective analysis and diagnosis. \n\nThanking you for teaching us the difference between Fact and Faith: Fact is when any ordinary doctor diagnoses illness in a report. Faith is when a great doctor like you give their patients the strength to recover. Else, We would never have been able to became a parent of bliss.\n\nYou have been much more to us than just a doctor. You have been my therapist, supporter, friend, well wisher and angel in disguise.\n\nMany Thanks.\nRegards,\nAnuradha and Subhransu",

I met the first doctor who was available at Cloudnine OAR on that particular day, and got an appointment booked for Dr. Monika Yadav. I have heard of women investing time to research and find a good gynecologist who they can connect with. I consider myself very lucky to get a doctor like Dr. Monika. She's very friendly, easy to talk to, would explain in layman's term about anything and everything you want to know from your gynec. My water broke in 34th week and had to be rushed to the hospital late in the midnight. Doc was informed and she came and visited me early in the morning, I think around 5-6 am. I was in pain for close to 18 hours. I almost gave up and was ready to go for a C section for I couldn't bear the pain anymore. But Dr. Monika gave me hope and relief and explained how beautiful and empowering it would feel after a vaginal delivery. She gave me strength and the mental power to endure the pain. I remember I literally called her every hour for some kind of update as I was hanging in pain and she would console me to not give up. And just as she promised, a vaginal delivery indeed was as beautiful as miracle. It sure is painful, but \"beautiful\", how Dr Monika calls it. I believe it all depends on your doc, and your comfort level with them. I would any day give her 10 stars on a rating scale of 5. I'm that happy and satisfied with her.  Dr Monika took such good care of me throughout my 7-8 months of interaction, she felt like family to me. \nTo anyone reading this, she is the gynec you need! \n\n",

Since day one she ensured that we receive all the information pertaining to the process and made extra effort to explain us things that we were not knowing. She became our friend, philosopher and guide during the entire process and thus developed an amazing bond of trust between us. She tries to put emphasis on the natural food habits and exercises to ensure that the baby grows as healthy as possible. Off course there were come complications for my wife but we were explained so well about each and every tests that we had to do or the changes in medication that we had to undergo. She was available over a call/ message always and went out of the way to ensure that we experience and enjoy the entire process together. She is kind, thoughtful and doesn't prescribe unnecessary medications nor does unnecessary scans. We were amazed to see her determination to push us for a Normal Delivery as she thought that was possible. All she asked us was for some time to ensure that my wife gets into labor as naturally as possible. We went through the labor pains, had some agitated moments as it was the first time we were experiencing something like that, but Dr. Monika was there for us always like a guiding force doing what was needed and was right for my wife at that time. \nWe had a healthy baby boy through normal delivery on 14th of Feb 2021 and things went exactly how the doctor had planned for us. We continue to see her for some post natal check ups and will definitely refer her to all our known and unknown ones too. \nShe is the best (Yes we did take second opinions initially just to be sure off and can say this comparing few other doctors) not only because of the profession that she is in but also for the person she is ....smiling, jovial and with loads of patience.\n*** *** **** ****** *** Thank you once again from all of us :)\nRegards\nPratikshya, Baby Arthav and Abhishek",

When we came to know that we are expecting our second child, we were in search of a high risk pregnancy expert as the previous one was a miscarriage in the 20th week. From the very first day, Dr. Monika explained us every minute details regarding the care to be taken. Never subscribed any extra medication. Always with her signature smile, listening to all our queries with utmost patience, given us ample amount of time during each check up. She has gone out of the way to give us her Whatsapp number in case of emergency.  Whenever in doubt, we used to ping her and to our utmost surprise, she always used to reply within minutes. The best thing about her is she remembers every minute details of what you have told her fom the first visit. This made her our friend, philosopher and guide during these crucial 9 months of pregnancy and corona time. I have developed gestational diabetes during my third trimester. She has advised me to send me all sugar readings to her everyday. It helped me to keep on a check regarding my diet. The love, care and affection she has given us in this crucial time is highly appreciated. Her comforting behavior has relaxed me and given me ample amount of strength during the operation time. We were thinking God has came in her form to deliver us our bundle of joy. Se is just an angel in the white apron. Thank you Mam for everything. May the almighty shower his precious blessings on you. Keep spreading the joy. We began as a patient and ended with becoming huge fan of her charisma. \n\nTapan & Ranjita\n\n",

We had experienced preterm miscarriage in 2020. Post which we started consultation with Dr Monika and we did see lot of positivity during the course of our second pregnancy in 2021. Though this time again we had issues of short cervix but with doctor's advice and her pure dedication and true efforts we continued till 34th week and delivered healthy baby boy in jan 2022. On every single occasion where her strict decision had to be made ,she did and that helped seriously for our better being. During entire pregnancy she had been like family member and left no chance to showcase her care and professionalism. Even when my wife was on strict bedrest she managed consultation and checkups at our convenience and without a miss. Her every decision proved fruitful and most accurate. We highly recommend Dr Monika yadav for all sort of pregnancy related advice and consultation. She is gem of a person and posses high skill and extremely great attitude. Thank you so very much Monika maam. Also thanks to cloudnine hospital for having such highly skilled doctors.",

She gave me diet chart and I followed her every word during my pregnancy and I did not have single pregnancy related issue. Monica mam was so much helpful and the day when my water has been broken at 10pm, she asked me to admit in emergency and she also came in hospital within half an hour. And on that day our son Arush born. I recovered very soon and it was happened only for doctor mam. I always got lots of positive energy from her which helped me to heal my wound. We will be grateful to her for whole life to give us our lifetime happiness and we always want that God always should be with her and blessed her lots of bliss. THANK YOU MAM.",

Every time there was a problem, she would be there to ensure everything was sorted. Even regarding scan reports,  blood tests results etc. And she always took the time to follow up on each thing personally. As the date for delivery drew nearer,  we panicked and requested for a C section. But she took the time to convince and counsel both my husband and me to try and do a normal delivery.  Thanks to her I had an almost pain free, beautiful birth experience with the bare minimum pain. Even post birth, she has taken the time to visit us in the room and also follow up personally once we were back home. Apart from her medical expertise,  her bedside manner and emotional support are commendable.  I would highly recommend her. ",

But We are going one step further to also to recommend you as a great Doctor and a extraordinary Human being.\n\nMore than a good doctor, We value the fact that you were a good listener. More than being just professionals, we value the fact that your attitude was exceptional. \n\nThe very thought of hospitalization is scary and traumatizing. But caring doctors like you make it friendly and pleasing. You always treat us as your family. Thanks for your effective analysis and diagnosis. \n\nThanking you for teaching us the difference between Fact and Faith: Fact is when any ordinary doctor diagnoses illness in a report. Faith is when a great doctor like you give their patients the strength to recover. Else, We would never have been able to became a parent of bliss.\n\nYou have been much more to us than just a doctor. You have been my therapist, supporter, friend, well wisher and angel in disguise.\n\nMany Thanks.\nRegards,\nAnuradha and Subhransu",

I truly believe that her expertise and dedication to her work are the reason why I have two healthy, happy babies today.\n\nI can't recommend my gynecologist highly enough.

We being first-time parents had little knowledge and even questions, but she explained everything in detail. The best part was even during those covid times she was never in a rush. We wanted a normal delivery. She was patient and guided us through this experience perfectly. In the end, it was successful and I was able to deliver naturally. She made our pregnancy journey very smooth. Throughout these 9 months, the doctor was always approachable. She is a very good listener and is one of the most polite doctors I have met, she treats her patient very nicely and gives them proper time. Highly Recommended. thank u so much Monika mam for being there always for us...for making this journey so beautiful for us... :)",

She patiently explained everything and also counselled me as my emotions were all over the place during that phase. I finally landed up having a surgery which I was very scared of but being in the hands of not only a good doctor but also a warm compassionate human being really helped me get through the phase. I will always be grateful to Dr. Monika for handling my case so well and being so warm and patient with me. God bless you Dr. Monika, you were an angel in a very difficult phase of my life.  ",

During each visit, Dr. Monika has been extremely professional while also being extremely personable, ensuring that all of my concerns were addressed. She didn't rush me, but instead listened to me and gave me sound advice. She guided me and recommended the best physical workout, which was critical in getting my body ready for the big day, and it worked like magic.Thank you, Dr. Monika!",
