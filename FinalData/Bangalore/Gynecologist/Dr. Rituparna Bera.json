They gave high praises to her humane and compassionate way of taking ownership of her patients journey. She always went the extra mile to care, guide and counsel the patients. We were already trying to get pregnant for few years when we went to Dr Ritu for pre pregnancy counselling. And that's when we absolutely fell in love with her way of explaining technical complications in easy to understand step by step logical and scientific approach. We followed her advise to the last detail and were able to concieve soon naturally. Our pregnancy proceeded under her able guidance. She always emphasised to us the natural way of birthing. All medical interventions, if any, were suggested only when absolutely needed. At 39th week when my water broke, we got ourselves admitted as per her guidance and the next very day we were holding our healthy baby in our hands. Even the recovery for me, the mother is progressing swiftly. I have already started to walk, albeit slowly. To us she was like an elder sister, always approachable and ready with expert guidance. We are very grateful for having her as our guide, mentor and doctor in our pregnancy journey.  - Jayashree Kundu ",

They gave high praises to her humane and compassionate way of taking ownership of her patients journey. She always went the extra mile to care, guide and counsel the patients. We were already trying to get pregnant for few years when we went to Dr Ritu for pre pregnancy counselling. And that's when we absolutely fell in love with her way of explaining technical complications in easy to understand step by step logical and scientific approach. We followed her advise to the last detail and were able to concieve soon naturally. Our pregnancy proceeded under her able guidance. She always emphasised to us the natural way of birthing. All medical interventions, if any, were suggested only when absolutely needed. At 39th week when my water broke, we got ourselves admitted as per her guidance and the next very day we were holding our healthy baby in our hands. Even the recovery for me, the mother is progressing swiftly. I have already started to walk, albeit slowly. To us she was like an elder sister, always approachable and ready with expert guidance. We are very grateful for having her as our guide, mentor and doctor in our pregnancy journey.  - Jayashree Kundu ",

She will tell you all the complications associated with pregnancy in every month so that we will be cautious which I expected from my doctor. Ritu always encourage you to go with a normal delivery unless you have any other complications. I gave vaginal birth even though my water broke and no progress in labour for more than 5-6 hours after inducing with all her support. She has an option to go with caesarean but patiently waited for my labour pains to start.

Dr. Rituparna ensured I understood the reasons behind each step and the role of every medication during the gestational period.\n\nHer approach is practical and considerate. She never advised unnecessary scans or tests, which not only saved us money but also provided peace of mind. Compared to my first pregnancy, this experience was much more financially manageable and stress-free.\n\nDr. Rituparna's exceptional listening skills and approachable demeanour made it easy to discuss any concerns or doubts. She is an active and patient listener, always ready to provide thorough and compassionate answers. She is truly gifted in her craft, and I couldn't have found a better doctor for my pregnancy and delivery. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone in need of outstanding prenatal and delivery care.",

From the very first appointment, she had this calming aura that just made me feel instantly relaxed and reassured. It was clear she really cared about her patients and understood all the anxieties that come with being pregnant.\n\nShe took all the time in the world to explain everything to us, from each stage of pregnancy to all the tests and scans we'd need. She never made us feel rushed and answered every question we had, no matter how silly it might have seemed.\n\nWhat we especially loved about Dr. Ritu was how much she pushed for a natural delivery if possible. We were on board with that approach, and thanks to her guidance and support (and of course, following her instructions!), we were able to have a smooth pregnancy and deliver our beautiful son naturally.\n\nWe honestly feel incredibly lucky to have had Dr. Ritu with us on this journey. Her expertise is top-notch, of course, but it was her kindness, empathy, and the way she treated us as individuals that truly made the difference.  She absolutely helped us achieve the positive and fulfilling pregnancy experience we'd always hoped for. If you're looking for the best doctor in the city for a natural birth, look no further than Dr. Ritu!",

She is such a wonderful doctor who takes utmost care of her patients. Her excellent expertise and efficiency and the precision with which she accomplishes her duty as a responsible and dedicated doctor is commendable. \nI approached Dr. Rituparna for the opinion on conceiving for the second child. Since I was 40+ and already had 2 miscarriages, I lost all hope of having a second child. She had done some initial investigation and confirmed that I can conceive naturally and suggested a few medications. As she said I conceived within 6 months after consulting her. I was a bit worried during my pregnancy due to the age factor, but she took all possible precautions to make  it a healthy pregnancy. After 38 weeks, I delivered a healthy baby. She proved that age does not matter for having a baby.                                                                                                                       I highly recommend her for any pregnancy/infertility issue and,  believe me you will be in a safe hand.                     \"Thanks a lot Dr. Rituparna\", I would be forever grateful to you for turning my dream into reality.\n\n    ",

She supported me through my delivery and continued to provide care even afterward. The most remarkable aspect for me is that, despite my usual anxiety, she made me feel incredibly calm and at ease.\n\nIf I detailed everything, this note would be quite lengthy.

In short as per her guidance, delivered a baby with just 6hrs of labour through NVD.\n Then again consulted Ritu Mam after 2.5 years for not getting pregnancy then she did some scans and found that there was a cyst near the uterus. Then she did laparoscopic cystectomy, and assured that I will get pregnancy for sure, then we tried for pregnancy after few months and got the results positive.\nThen started the 2nd pregnancy journey with her from the day I got to know that I was conceived. This time everything was gone smoothly. But found that my baby was in breech position. I was worried because of the breech presentation of a baby. But Mam had a strong belief that baby would turn to normal position. For that she suggested some excercises. In the next scan baby turned little bit and was in the transverse position. And she suggested me to continue the same exercises. Finally baby head is down. Seriously I was very worried about the position of baby. But mam was confident enough that baby will turn. Her words and the explanation helps to reduce the stress of pregnancy. Finally the labour day came and got delivered a baby with just around 2hrs of labour.\nThere might lot of best doctor are there but for me *** ** *** **** ** *** **** ******* And like a goddess. \nHer explanation about the things and her friendly nature makes her different from other doctors and keep her in a step above. That gives more confidence and support.\n\nThanks a lot Ritu Mam for supporting and for NVD.",

Dr. Ritu is the best thing that has happened to us . I am in awe of her patience and dedication she has for her patients . Just commendable !\u00a0We had certain age related complications during the early stage of pregnancy but Dr.\u00a0 was very open to us about the issues and the next course of treatment/tests. She monitored me thoroughly throughout the pregnancy and ensured everything was in control . *** *** *** ********* *** *********** ********** ** ***** **On the day of delivery , the doctor was regularly checking on me through WhatsApp and visited me several times to check if I was ready for the NVD . After the delivery , she visited me at 4:30am to see if I was doing ok.\u00a0 The best thing which I have never seen any other doctor do is , Dr Ritu texted me a week after the discharge to check on my wellbeing . I am her fan after this gesture of hers' . Truly a gem and a wonderful gynaecologist one can trust for any gynaec and pregnancy related issues. We are immensely grateful to her for helping us bring our lovely daughter into this world !!",

We followed the directions for two months,and conceived naturally in the third month.During our visits in the journey of  pregnancy, she gave us thorough explanations of everything. She was able to evaluate my health and provide me with all the required guidance and advice,which was incredibly helpful. When it comes to the patient's diagnosis and treatment, she is amiable yet competent. In an emergency, the doctor has always been reachable, even through WhatsApp, to address our queries. I gave birth to a boy baby doctor focus was to go with normal delivery, I have not met a doctor who approaches their patients with such assurance, warmth, and the appropriate mindset. We are grateful to the doctor, without whom we would not have had such a challenging pregnancy. And the journey going on positive vibe with happiness strongly advise and suggest to the community looking for a Gynaecologist.",

I was mentally prepared to do IVF, and then we were lucky to meet Dr. Rituparna. She carefully checked my medical history and advised us to determine the root cause before going for such expensive treatments. After few months of medication, she performed a diagnostic hysterolaparoscopy and explained me the issues. We understood that even if I can conceive naturally, the chances are less.\n\nEventually I went through IVF treatment from a renowned IVF center in Bangalore. Dr. Rituparna was always in touch and watched over the process. Unfortunately, the treatment did not work out. However, we did not lose hope and continued the treatment with Dr. Ritu. She changed few medications based on the previous tests and feedback, and I conceived naturally at the end. But the things again got complicated due to some issues in the first trimester. Dr. Ritu took utmost care in solving the problem, timely scanning and checkup, antenatal care and delivery of the baby.\n\nDr. Rituparna is an excellent doctor and amazing human being. She patiently listens and discusses every problem with minute details, explains the problems and each medicine she prescribes. Above all, she gave us lots of confidence every time we visited her.\n\nI will definitely recommend Dr. Rituparna to each and every one reading this review.\n",

I have been married for 10 years now and we have been trying to conceive since the second year of marriage. I consulted many doctors in various streams of medicines like ayurveda, homeopathy and allopathy. I also underwent the laparoscopic surgery to burn few ovarian cysts. All the doctors I consulted were focused on ovarian induction and conception. None of them focused on curing the underlying issue of PCOD. We moved to HBR layout in Bangalore and started looking for a good gynecologist again. We found about Dr. Rituparna Beria Sarkar through Google reviews and decided to consult her. From day one of consultation, her approach towards the treatment was logical and convincing. The way she interacted with the patients was very welcoming and friendly. She patiently heard to all our concerns and explained the line of treatment clearly. While all other doctors inclined towards IVF, Dr. Ritu was very clear that we will go for IVF as a last option. She targeted the core issue, PCOD directly through medication. We were able to conceive in just a few months of treatment, but it was a failed conception. But Dr. Ritu filled us with hope and positivity. We were able to conceive again through IUI within about 18 months of treatment with Dr. Ritu and we are blessed with a baby girl now. Even for delivery, her focus was to do a normal delivery until the last minute.",

So initially we were hesitant to deliver in Bangalore as we were informed that doctors here aren\u2019t patient enough to do normal delivery. After various research, we came across dr Ritu Parna profile in google with lot of good reviews, and as it was listed nearby our house, so we thought to give a try. To our utter satisfaction from day 1 she greeted and welcomed us with a smile. She is patient enough, doesn\u2019t rush through, she clarifies all your doubts. Most importantly she informs what is only needed to be known. Even though I ask the silliest or dumbest questions she doesn\u2019t shy away but answers them mockingly. She is so dedicated to her job that not one day have we seen her take leave or report late. From morning to late evening, she is in clinic and late nights to and fro to hospitals delivering babies. She is a passionate doc who seems to work round the clock. I have never seen a doctor with such true dedication and sincerity. She doesn\u2019t charge you with lot of tests or scans especially gives tablets which are only necessary. I was low on vitamin d asked her to prescribe tablet she refused and insisted that I get enough sunlight. I had few complications low lying placenta, low amniotic fluid and growth restriction but she didn\u2019t not scare me with any of these conditions, in fact when I felt so low and negative, she scolded me to see things positively. She suggested me only walking because of my complications and when baby was nearing full term and when most of conditions were eradicated, she suggested few exercises for normal delivery which I couldn\u2019t do full-fledged due to my weight gain and knee pain. On my labour day, she took wise decision of enabling me to undergo most of the pain at the comfort of my home and when the intensity increased only then I was admitted in hospital and doc irrespective of her sickness rushed to the hospital exactly at the time when my labour kick started. To conclude in a line, Doc Ritu is an answered prayer. My prayer was that I should be guided by a doctor who doesn\u2019t intervene medically or scientifically in the beautiful art of the Lords hands raising a new life from the womb to the world, painlessly. And yes, I delivered naturally almost without much pain as I was blessed by God to undergo precipitated labour within one and half hours my baby girl was in my hands. Thank you doc, you are a God sent angel who had delivered my baby. Never seen such a doctor who is humble, down to earth and sweet person by heart who doesn\u2019t show-off. Keep up the good work doc!!!",

                "review_text": "We visited Dr. Rituparna for PCOD treatment and pregnancy planning. We decided that Dr. Ritu is going to be our doctor for our pregnancy journey at the first consultation.Dr. Ritu clearly explained us the problem and course of plan for the treatment, she never hurried upon things and always took one step at time and was very passionate in what she was doing.The treatment began with few lifestyle changes and few medications that Dr. Ritu had prescribed. During the initial few days, it wasn't easy for me to do adopt to the lifestyle modifications that doctor had suggested but she kept motivating and encouraging me to push harder with few simple suggestions, these suggestions which helped me to make the lifestyle changes.As some cysts were still persistent and was not supporting us to conceive, doctor suggested us Ovulation Induction(OI) for conception. There started our pregnancy journey, in two months of OI, I luckily conceived. From there on doctor guided me all the blood tests and scans to be performed, on a timely basis she explained what test/scan had to be done and for what and no unnecessary test/scan was prescribed. Things were going as expected uptill the seventh month of pregnancy, during the growth scan in the seventh month doctor diagnosied that there was a growth restriction in the baby due to a restriction in blood flow. This made us to panic and were not clear on the next steps, doctor understood what we were going through and helped us to understand the situation and not to panic and told us that she is there to handle it and she will take care of it. Then just to rule out any anamolies in the scan, doctor suggested us to repeat the scan in 1-2 different centers over a time range of 1-2 weeks. When those scan reports too diagnosied growth restriction, doctor counselled us on the next steps and kept me in close monitoring where I was sending daily fetal movement counts directly to doctor. So it was clear by now that I was not going to complete my entire pregnancy term as it was going to very risky for my baby, at the same time doctor was also not in favour of delivering the baby immediately even though there was growth restriction to the baby inside me. She told us that it is better for the baby to stay inside than to deliver it early, as long as it not concerning any danger to the baby and the mother. She prolonged the baby's stay inside for a few more weeks with close monitoring and started few medications parallely for organ development for the baby, as we expected an early delivery. Just when the blood flow restriction was starting to deteriorate, doctor asked me to get admitted immediately and kept me under close observation. This deterioration was still not causing any harm to the baby or me yet, so she was trying to prolong the delivery by few more hours so that baby gets somemore time inside me. After a few hours of close observation in the hospital, doctor advised the right time for delivey and after our consent she delivered me by a C-Section to welcome a baby boy. After a few days of medical attention to the baby at the hospital, during which too Dr.Ritu kept following up on the baby's health with both us as well as the pediatricians taking care of the baby. We are now a happy family with our first child.We thank Dr. Rituparna for all the attention and care she has shown on us, for explaining and clearing our doubts by taking enough time during our consultations in spite of other patients waiting for their turn. We started our journey with Dr. Rituparna as a patient, now we feel like we have a sister or a friend who is there to care for us. We wish Dr. Rituparna the best as she continues to serve many more expectant parents like us. We wish the very best to the new parents to be as well.",

In Fact we got our day when my Pregnancy confirmed 8 months back.We used to consult another Doctor in September 2020 and it continued for a year with 4/5 Scans in a month to check Egg Growth, then Ovulation Induction Medication, Progesterone , Estrogen , lot of Medication and Tests which didn't help us and which results lot of health issues and lot of mental stress , Finally lost the hope on Pregnancy. Next suggestion was to go for IUI which we didn't want to go and took break for 3 months.After taking 3 months gap , Due to delay in Menstrual Cycle , decided to consult some other Doctor.That time we have gone through the reviews in Practo and decided to consult Doctor Rituparna.On the First day of Consultation with Doctor Rituparna , Doctor told no need to worry if you are getting Menstrual cycle within 45 days and that statement gave us a big relief. (This statement was very helpful that time as when we were consulting with previous Doctor, we used to go for 4/5 times scan within a month and  have medicine prescribed to skip the current cycle & to move on to the next cycle in case the Egg Size is not as expected atleast by 18th day and expectation was max 30-35 days of Menstrual Cycle)On the first day of our consultation with the Doctor Rituparna , By seeing the previous reports , Doctor explained what could be the reasons from my end & my husband's end and prescribed as below..1. Wait till 45th day from last menstrual date and then have one Tablet to get the Period (if not getting period in 45 days) & move to next cycle.2. If get the next cycle before 45th day , Start using one tablet for PCOS & Egg quality for me and one Tablet for my husband. 3. Doctor told to follow this medication for 3 months.On following the above , Within 2 months ,  My pregnancy is confirmed without any other medication/tests/treatment.And Doctor Ritu always ...1. Have patience to listen all our problems/doubts2. Spends more time during  consultation to explain the problem and the possible solution3. Friendly. Can talk freely on our doubts.4. Suggests required Medication and not excess Medication5. Provides Whatsapp Meessge support on any doubts6. Reachable on Phone from 7th Month Pregnancy in case of any Emergnecy7.Time Panctual  8. Sugget only required tests And all the Staff in Ritu Women's Clinic is very supportive and polite.Thank you very much Doctor for all your support and guidance throughout our journey.Thank you very much to Doctor's entire team for all the timely support.Thank you is very small word for your help Doctor. Wishing you all the happiness in your life and your family.We highly recommend Doctor Rituparna for any Ganecology and Pregnancy related Problems.",

In Fact we got our day when my Wife's Pregnancy confirmed 8 months back.\n\nWe used to consult another Doctor in September 2020 and it continued for a year with 4/5 Scans in a month to check Egg Growth, then Ovulation Induction Medication, Progesterone , Estrogen , lot of Medication and Tests which didn't help us and which results lot of health issues and lot of mental stress , Finally lost the hope on Pregnancy. Next suggestion was to go for IUI which we didn't want to go and took break for 3 months.\n\nAfter taking 3 months gap , Due to delay in Menstrual Cycle , decided to consult some other Doctor.\n\nThat time we have gone through the reviews in Practo and decided to consult Doctor Rituparna.\n\nOn the First day of Consultation with Doctor Rituparna , Doctor told no need to worry if you are getting Menstrual cycle within 45 days and that statement gave us a big relief. (This statement was very helpful that time as when we were consulting with previous Doctor, we used to go for 4/5 times scan within a month and have medicine prescribed to skip the current cycle & to move on to the next cycle in case the Egg Size is not as expected atleast by 18th day and expectation was max 30-35 days of Menstrual Cycle)\n\nOn the first day of our consultation with the Doctor Rituparna , By seeing the previous reports , Doctor explained what could be the reasons from my end & my wife's end and prescribed as below..\n\n\n1. Wait till 45th day from last menstrual date and then have one Tablet to get the Period (if not getting period in 45 days) & move to next cycle.\n2. In case get the next cycle before 45th day , Start using one tablet for PCOS & Egg quality for my wife and one Tablet for me. \n3. Doctor told to follow this medication for 3 months.\n\nOn following the above , Within 2 months ,  My wife's pregnancy is confirmed without any other unnecesaary medication/tests/treatment.\n\nAnd Doctor Ritu always ...\n1. Have patience to listen all our problems/doubts\n2. Spends more time during  consultation to explain the problem and the possible solution\n3. Friendly and Can talk freely on our doubts.\n4. Suggests required Medication and not excess \nMedication\n5. Provides Whatsapp Message support on any doubts\n6. Reachable on Phone from 7th Month Pregnancy in case of any Emergnecy\n7.Time Panctual  \n8. Sugget only required tests \n\nAnd all the Staff in Ritu Women's Clinic is very supportive and polite.\n\nThank you very much Doctor for all your support and guidance throughout our journey.\n\nThank you very much to Doctor's entire team for all the timely support.\n\nThank you is very small word for your help Doctor. Wishing you all the happiness in your life and your family.\n\nWe highly recommend Doctor Rituparna for any Ganecology and Pregnancy related Problems.",

On our first visit , Dr. noted down all my details and explained us very nicely about all the DOs and DONTs in the early pregnancy.  From 2nd visit onwards She remembered all our past discussion and also explained need of few Tests due to my age but never asked for any unnecessary test.  I liked the way she extended personal touch all the time and most of the time I felt like I was speaking with a friend or a family member rather than a Dr.  After 7 months she gave me her personal number and asked me to reach out to her for any issues. \nSince then whenever i messaged her, she definitely replied however busy she was.  She asked me to message baby count everyday to her and I did so and whenever I missed to update her, she proactively messaged me to check if everything was ok.  She also suggested natural therapy for any other health related issues in his period. \nShe always motivated me to go for Normal delivery but as my first one was C-section, I was bit sceptical and hence I discussed this topic in many of my visits but we could not decide until one day I felt baby movement reduced and hence went for urgent checkup. Dr scanned and found that all of sudden my water level reduced due to excessive dehydration caused by fever and suggested me to get admitted. Hence I got admitted at OVUM. Doctor explained that she would try to delay the operation as that time baby was 35+ weeks and was not mature.\nAfter a day i took discharge as treatment showed encouraging sign. We followed doctor's suggestion and went for GTT scan and went to see the doctor with the report next day . This time doctor repeated my scan at clinic and did a matching of the same with GTT report and concluded the further delay could be harmful for baby . Hence after days I got admitted and delivered a baby boy at OVUM Hospital . Even though It was C-Section and I started walking next day and literally felt good next day thanks to Dr. Rituparna for her expert handling of the difficult case timely with easy and confidence. \nAs baby was not mature and diagonised with Jaundice, we had to stay back in hospital for few more days for his treatment but Dr. used to visit me everyday at least once a day to check recovery and enquired about the baby.  I am really thankful to her for guiding me delivering my little bundle of joy safely. God bless you and your team and I pray that you continue helping would be parents with your skill and empathy.  \n",

Me and my husband was alone throughout the pregnancy we explained everything to Dr Ritu about our daliy life, she always gave \nus support and care. After 6 month Dr Ritu shared her personal number to us for continuous follow up through what's app and also told incase any emergency call her immediately she will response which shows that she is not a doctor but good human being who always think about her patients. We used to send daily fetal movement count by 12 pm night time and she replied if same day. We choose Ovum hospital for delivery because cost was minimal for us but Dr Ritu always give options to all patients so that they can select the hospital as per their requirement. My husband was very much tensed till the time Dr Ritu came to hospital for delivery, my husband was standing outside the OT and wating for Dr Ritu, the time Dr came he was happy because I was alone inside the OT and my expression was not so good because of little bit fear. But before entering to OT Dr Ritu told my husband while taking to preety i will complete everything you don't worry. Eventually she came inside make me comfortable, gave me very strong support as like mother i can say, because of that I came to know I am in safe hand and she wil take care of everything. Before that everything was unexpected for me. As a doctor to do this much is unexpected only. Why because the story I heard of my friends delivery was totally different then me. I never ever imagine that it will be so happy and enjoyable moment in pregnancy which was possible only because of Ritu ma'am. After delivery dr Use to visit 2 times in a day for check up because I stayed in hospital for 3 days, I undergone LACS because of my many complications, But here I just wanted to highlight one things like dr Ritu always push and suggest for Normal delivery till the time patient doesn't have any issues. I like this things very such about her. I came to know Dr Ritu through one of my friend not from practo. These words are not sufficient i can write more and more good things about her and behaviour is fabulous it was really surprised that after post delivery also i visited her for post follow up and it got to know so many things.I just wanted to say her thankyou sooo much for each and everything maam I feel blessed that I know her... thankyou once again ma'am \u2764\ufe0f luv u and we will miss u.

In initial consultation she made me to aware how many test and why it is required. No unnecessary test .she also mentioned which is mandatory and which is optional test. Best thing in house ultrasound machine and lab/pharmacy .every time you visit and you don't need to run here and there for test and medicines.My blood haemoglobin level was low 10.4 and with her advice and medicine it was reached to 13.4.Second hurdle,she diagnosed and found nuchal cord rapped around baby neck,she asked me to track baby movements in a particular time and also shared her emergency contact details.Nuchal cord got off from neck after few months .She was tracking down baby growth in every visit and flagged for any abnormalities and area of improvement.She clearly mentioned in last month of pregnancy cervix is too firm and there might be chances of prolonged labour pain. On Final day when labour pain started I pinged her and she asked me to get admitted in hospital .She came to hospital and examined me.Labour pain lasted for more than 11 hrs in Hospital,I asked her to do C section.she said then why you wasted 11 hrs and again encourage me for Normal Delivery. \n\nWhen C section is trend nowadays even though she encourage for Normal Delivery.\n\nAfter I delivered a baby boy ,Dr Ritu Parna Madam used to visit every day at Hospital till my last date of discharge and she used to asked  me and my Lil one well being and used to suggest usefull advice for reducing pain and swelling.\n\nI am going to miss Dr Ritu Ma'am and her loving staff.each visit to her Clinic was like going to meet family member.\n\nShe suggested Ovum Hospital which was really amazing as no one came from my family so me and my husband had to manage everything.Due to her support and supportive nurses everything was so memorable for me.\n\nHospital Physiotherapist came and said Dr Ritu Madam means only normal Vaginal delivery.\nDr Ritu Parna Madam is sweet , trustworthy, knowledgeable and explain everything clearly with logic.\n\"Affordable and best treatment\"\nI will refer my friends to this clinic.\nMy greatest pleasure to meet Dr Ritu Madam and making this journey memorable.\n",

We went to see Dr. Rituparna on the same day and she explained us very nicely about all the DOs and DONT's in the early pregnancy which is very important to know these days due to our lifestyles. \n\nAfter, our first consulation, with Dr. Rituparna, Me and my husband decided that we will continue with the same Dr. throughout as we felt very comfortable talking to her and most importantly her detaied explanation and assurance to me being pregnant for the first time. \n\nDr. Rituparna is a fine mix of care and caution. I loved the way she gave me that personal touch all the time. Felt like a care from a family member. Also she cautioned me at times on the DONT'S - don't eat junk food/ don't let your weight increase beyond certain level and explained the reasons behind them. \n\nDr. Rituparna never asked me to do any unnecessary tests nor scared me Into doing one. With all her instructions and advices, it all went well. \n\nWe came to 9th month of pregnancy. Our visits frequency stated increasing as the date was closer. In 9th month, minor complications were observed like a little decline in baby's heart rate, CPR ratio bit below required range etc. Dr. Rituparna assured that she'll not do the delivery until it's time. And we knew we can trust Dr. 100%.\n15 days past 8 months, in one of the routine tests, while doing NST. at Dr.'s clinic, baby's heart rate started dipping gradually due to the umbilical cord being tied around baby's neck. \nIt could have been very serious for our baby had we not visited that day for our routine check up. I remember Dr. Rituparna came running upon listening to the drop in the heart rate volume and immediately asked us to get admitted for a C section delivery. \n\nThe same day, 05th Jan 2022, with God's blessings & Dr. Rituparna's experience in handling complex situations, we got the news of BLUE. We were blessed with a lovely baby boy. Perfectly alright. Absolutely no issues at all. My baby and me were doing all good. \n\nI don't know if I thanked Dr. Rituparna for her quick identification of the issue and suggesting us to get admitted and get the delivery done, but me and my husband personally feel, that at such times sometimes each and every day counts. One day late and things can go south. \n\nI've heard, sometimes, some parents don't listen to Doctors when it comes to C section deliveries and then later regret after a mishap due to complication. But i think we should NEVER ignore what our doctors advice. \n\nMe & my husband didn't ignore the advice and today we have our baby healthy in our hands. All due to Dr. Rituparna. \n\nShe's a gem of a doctor. I recommend Dr. Rituparna for all your Gynaec issues. ***** *** **** *** ***** ****",

                "review_text": "We were visiting Manipal hospitals for an year including the time before conception for tests and guidance. After my wife concieved, we were looking to consult a doctor who is committed to performing normal delivery as first priority. We were worried about the current state in which doctors look for reasons to do c section as over the time its price has shot up. At this point i came to know about Dr. Rituparna from a friend who stays near hennur who got his baby delivered normally with her help. I was moved by his experience with Dr. Rituparna and hence despite the Distance being more from home to Dr visit  compared to going to Manipal, i chose to consult Dr. Rituparna. It was a very refreshing and a congineal experience. We never felt like speaking to a doctor but rather felt like speaking to a friend. We got in touch in 8th month and since then whenever we visited her, she would explain everything in detail and with various examples to make us understand the situation. It was clearly visible that the advices she use to give us were keeping in mind that we need normal delivery. The choices of medicines, exercices everything was explained in detail and she use to always council us on questions we have which gave us peace of mind and only wait for the day. My wife's water broke 3 weeks before delivery date and we contacted Dr. Ritu on phone. She was quick to respond and asked to come to hospital. My wife was loosing the water frequently even when she was walking or moving but had no pain. In this situation c section was very justifiable, but still she said we ll try our best to do normal delivery. For which she asked to make no movements and gave her medicines to induce pain. In next 8 hours the dilation happened until 8cm when my wife was moved to labour room. My wife wasn't able to push enough and the baby was at the same stage for 90minutes with the head out of the dilation. Slowly the heart rate and breathing of the baby started to drop. At this stage c section was not possible and vacuuming also was not possible as the baby got some swelling on his head already. A team along with 4-5 doctors and nurses helped my wife to deliver normally and at the right time. The baby was moved to NICU straight where he recovered and was discharged after 1.5 days. My wife is also recovering gradually. We finally got a normal delivery despite a bit of complexity. Many people might say many things but that day i was in the labour room and realised why doctors are compared with God. She gave life to both, my wife and kid. We can't thanks Dr. Rituparna enough for her efforts. I would personally recommend her to my friends.",

We visited her for the first time in march 2023 and the very first meeting was so comforting. She was very friendly and listened to all our problems patiently and suggested best possible solutions. \nShe is very serious when come to health issues and always advise the best things for her patients. \nThen after 8months of continuous visits here comes the delivery day. Doctor suggested three hospitals to us with utmost transparency so that it\u2019s easy for us to choose the hospital. \nFrom the beginning my husband and I wanted a normal delivery however I was scared as if I will be able to make it or not. But doctor was very supportive here, she kept suggesting me the exercises and kept motivating me for normal delivery and to avoid unnecessary c section. \nShe understands her patients so well that you can trust her and rest she will take care. I remember I was in labour and doctor came and made me to sit on the ball and help me doing the exercise holding my hand, I was crying in pain and she was consoling me with so much love and care. Only Dr. Rituparna can invest so much into her patients, No one else can do that, I\u2019m pretty sure.\n\n\nMy friend who\u2019s also expecting once told me that getting a good doctor during pregnancy is luck and yes, we are so lucky to get Dr. Rituparna, our star matches that day for sure and I can\u2019t thank enough for that. She is indeed a superstar. We are blessed with our first baby girl on November 18th\u2764\ufe0f",

It was a pleasant surprise and our journey along with Dr. Ritu started from that day. We had no prior recommendations or seen any review to consult with Dr. Ritu. The first visit gave us the confidence to continue the pregnancy journey with her.\n\nWe had a tumultuous journey during the pregnancy. The scan revealed high NT value suspected for high probability of abnormality in the baby. All along Dr.Ritu was rock solid with our decision to continue in each stage providing valuable inputs and treatments. She recommended us the Marker and NIPT tests to have healthy baby.\n\nThere were complications due to low hemoglobin and age adding another factor. Dr. Ritu provides only relevant medicines and does the scans herself. Major scans she refers outside. Every month the progress of baby's growth was observed and my wife\u2019s health and diet were continuously tracked. Under Dr.Ritu\u2019s expert consultation and medicine it was all sorted out with significant improvements during the entire pregnancy .\n\nDr.Ritu is soft spoken, humble, confident and answers up to the point crisp and clear. This gives us the complete scenario understanding and giving us the confidence to proceed.\n\nDuring the delivery phase, she gives options of multiple hospitals and we can select the appropriate hospital nearby the house. We had the delivery in Altius Hospital and she was there daily for the rounds. There was adhesions in the uterus to the stomach from the previous delivery and Dr.Ritu with her team in Altius ensured the adhesions were removed taking maximum care during the delivery process.\n\nWe were blessed with a healthy Baby Boy bringing a huge relief to us.\n\nDr. Ritu even visited us on Sunday assuring my wife on recovery process and infact she was more happy than us seeing my wife deliver a healthy baby boy and the recovery progress of my wife.\n\nFrom the initial consultation to the delivery of my baby, the experience was nothing but exceptional. We highly recommend Dr Ritu for Gynaecology and Pregnancy even with high complications. She handles the difficult situations with confidence and positive results is rest assured.\n\nThe staff in her clinic Sandhya, Sunanda and Narasimha were very helpful always with smile on their face\n\nLong story in short \"Recommend Dr. Ritu for high complication pregnancy\"\n",

From the very first appointment she established a warm and welcoming atmosphere and ensured that i felt comfortable.\nShe communicates clearly and provides thorough explanation ( without even asking - something that I always look out for in a doctor) , addressing any questions or concerns I had along the way. You can openly discuss your fears or anxiety with her.\nRegular checkups were done with strong attention to detail and giving detailed explanation of purpose and outcome of any tests that were done in the entire pregnancy period. She ensured that I ate healthy, exercised regularly to keep my and the growing baby's weight in check and also that I can have normal delivery. \n2-3 weeks before delivery, she started with exercises that would help me with normal delivery. She communicated clearly that at times the decisions are dynamic and needs to be taken proactively (for the sake of baby and mother). \nOn the day of my delivery\u00a0, when i was admitted in the hospital for normal delivery, the pain was unbearable and i was vomiting, she kept a tab on me, reached out to me to ensure that I get the required care. But, I had to undergo Cesarean section (since the baby passed motion inside the womb), she ensured that I was responding well during the operation. \nEven after my delivery, she responds whenever I reach out to her for any concerns (though she has a busy schedule). Her staff/team is also very warm and helpful. \n\nThank you for being such a wonderful person and a great doctor :)\n",

From the time we stepped into the clinic I had a positive vibes and inner feelings the time I saw the wall sticker \"Dreamy girl with flying colourful butterflies\". I was touched by the way they greeted us and advised each and every step from the Sandhya sister with warm welcoming smile and guiding us I never felt i have come to hospital and next Udaya sister knowledgeable girl who knows to take care of the patients and counseling in each and every stage and sharing lot of positive words and thoughts to my wife. Before we met the doctor my wife is completely scared about clinic and hospitals, however the day we met Rituparna Doctor it's truly amazing experience the way doctor spoke to us giving a clear picture of the present situation and being candid the most important thing give equal attention to all the patients and spending the quality of time in explaining and guiding the patients. Wife was checked and was informed stating it's a symptom of early pregnancy and has 4 cysts which can be a problem however no need to worry and was provided with medication and was advised to come for the next visit. when we visited the doctor for 2nd time it's a miracle that none of the cysts were visible that really showed the confidence and experience of the doctor and every time we visited the clinic we never felt that we are meeting the doctor we felt we are meeting our friends or relatives and from then we never thought so soon the 9 months passed and we are blessed with the prince in hands of Dr. Rituparna. I would like to take this moment and thank everyone in the clinic for their energy, patience and enthusiasm for each and every patient. No matter who asks me for any Gyne Doctor without doubt it would be our Dr. Rituparna.Last but not least never to forget the Sunandha sister who is closely working with the Doctor and gaining all the experience she's truly an inspiring girl for the people who visit the clinic.We can assure you until there is a critical issue the doctor doesn't suggest for Surgery and Dr. Rituparna always suggests and 100% guides patients for Normal Delivery always.",

Mam considered all those and never repeated any tests which were already present. She started the treatment from that point.\n\nDr. Ritu Parna treated with minimum medication and conducted scans which were only absolutely required. She always insisted my wife to change in lifestyle (proper exercise and diet plan). After sometime my wife conceived.\n\nDuring our entire pregnancy journey doctor treated my wife with utmost caring and guiding us through all the stages. She suggested all the exercises and plan to do for normal delivery (NVD). Madam used to be in personal contact with us during final months and used to observe daily fetal movements\n\nFor Delivery we admitted in hospital and in prior to this Doctor explained in detail about the procedure which they would be following. As baby's head position was not fixed due to more fluid, Doctor did ARM to reduce the fluid and suggested that after getting significant 4 hours of pain baby's head position will get fixed. After 3 hours, duty doctors checked the baby's head position as it was still high they've made arrangements for Caesarean section delivery and moved to OT, but once Dr. Ritu Parna arrived she checked and understood that head position was about to get fixed. So she moved my wife back to labor room and she did normal delivery (NVM) within 15 minutes.\n\nI honestly didn't have confidence that my wife will be able to pull the normal delivery. but thanks to Dr. Ritu Parna, with her support my wife was able to do it.\n\nFinally i can say one thing, Dr. Ritu Parna is a wonderful human being before being a good Gynaecologist.",

I had gone through the review on internet and gave a thought to try. And trust me, that was the best decision i made though i had to travel a distance of 20km to see doctor from my house everytime.\nOn my first visit, doctor systematically collected all my information and previous scan details and she prepared a antenetal profile and one would really need lot of patience to do that and believe me i have never met a doctor before who would invest so much time in a patient. She patiently listens to all your concerns and gives the best advice in a most simple language that anybody can understand. She clearly explains the thing sometimes with a diagram too :)\nI was diabetic during pregnancy and she motivated me very well to keep my sugar under control explaining the consequences which can be caused in case i m not within the range. Doctor is extremely friendly and you can talk to her openly about any of your concern and you can expect the most satisfactory reaction from her in return.\nThe fees that doctor charges for consultation is very less compared to rest gynecologists and its very difficult to find such a good doctor and its definitely value.\nDoctor never suggested for any unnecessary scans. She will herself perform most of the scans at reasonable price and hence you need not visit other labs. She will never force you to go for C section if NVD is possible. In my case, NVD was possible but i opted for elective C section as i was worried about my health concers - wheezing and diabetes.\nFinally, i delivered a beautiful baby girl on 14th October by C section, Ritu mam was the one who performed the procedure and whole thing took less than 15 mins and i was able to see my angel immediately. I did not face any consequence due to surgery and my baby is doing good as well.\nI would definitely recommend Ritu mam.\n",

Our gym trainer recommended visiting Mam's clinic once, and we started following up with Ritu Mam from day one after the positive pregnancy test.\n\nI am delighted and grateful that we chose Dr. Ritu Mam for my pregnancy and delivery. I admire her professionalism and the way she carries herself so beautifully dressed. She is very experienced, very friendly, cheerful, and full of energy as a person. Mam is one of the busiest doctors who never leaves her smile behind even though she works 24/7 for her patients. She was there patiently clearing all my doubts and gave us a stress-free relationship with her during consultations. She is a great listener, very concerned about her patient's well-being, and approachable at any time. She is always available to clarify any doubts through Whatsapp, even late at night, and answers call even in her busy schedule.\n\nWith Mam's support and guidance, I was relaxed and smiling while entering the operation theatre and came out smiling after giving birth to a healthy baby girl. She takes care of their patients with the utmost care, so people are connected to Mam more as a friend than as a patient-doctor relationship.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my pregnancy journey with her and felt blessed to hold my beautiful little angel on August 15th in Ovum HRBR Layout Branch. After delivery, she helped alleviate my fears when I had low milk production in the initial week. Mam, Thank you so much for everything; she will always be in my prayers. She will keep shining and help as many people as possible \u2013 I am sure she will. I am very blessed to meet Mam. No words to thank Mam. May God bless her and her family.",

I did a Google search to find a good gynaecologist near me and first reference I got was of Dr. Rituparna Sarkar. The reviews were very nice so i decided to have a consultation with her. During my first visit I was a little sceptical about it but all my uneasyness just vanished when we first met her. She was very friendly and we never felt like we are meeting her for the first time. It was like we are having a conversation with our family doctor. She went through all our previous reports and scans and advised us accordingly. I had missed my anamoly scan of fifth month and we were very tensed as after fifth month, scans can't determine if the baby has any kind of issues or not. But she has assured us that she will make sure a pediatrician does a through check up of the baby once the child is born. This increased our trust and confidence in her. She gave us her personal number on which I was supposed to send her daily featal movement count and whenever I missed to send it, she used to send me a reminder message proactively from her side. I wanted to have  a normal delivery but i knew it was difficult as my first delivery was a C section. During the end of ninth month, she prolonged my delivery for one week so that we can atleast try for normal delivery but at the same time keeping a tab on my condition as well as on the condition of the baby. But two days before my EDD, my water broke and she advised me to get admitted in the Ovum hospital. There also she waited for 4-5 hours to check if I get the labor pain nturally as they can't giveme any medicine to induce the pain. As the water level was reducing and I was not getting the pain naturally, she advised us that we should not wait for more and we decided to go for the C section only. The baby was fine and healthy. Post delivery she used visit the hospital twice a day to check how I and my baby are doing. I started walking from next day of surgery itself under her guidance. I will be thankful to her for making this whole process very easy for me in a completely new city. I would definitely recommend her for all your pregnacy related issues. You will be in good hands, that's for sure \ud83d\ude42",

Each and every time when we consulted Dr Ritu we were more confident and satisfied with the progress of pregnancy. By god\u2019s grace and Dr\u2019s guidance there were no complications in my pregnancy. However during the mid 8th month my Amniotic Fluid was around 8cm which was worrisome but by the medication given by Dr Ritu it also got increased...At the time of delivery I was not able to bear the labor pain and requested Dr to please do the c-section and my husband also lost hope that I can do normal delivery and asked Dr Ritu to take me to the OT. I was moved to OT room but Dr had still belief in me that I can do normal delivery, she rushed back to my husband and said she can do normal delivery and asked to convince me and finally all because of Dr Ritu I was able to deliver normally. Her experience and excellence played a big role in boosting up my confidence.Dr has been a blessing to us. Thank you for your excellent treatment and also grateful for your friendly staff members.You have no idea how much of a blessing you are to us. Thanks for being such an amazing doc.",

I experienced a warm and cordial journey that endured the entire span of 10 months of my first pregnancy. I'm not only satisfied with her treatment but also the way she treated my pregnancy. she is so polite and calm that I had no problem in asking any questions that would peep in my mind. she is very soft spoken and always ready to listen every minute details. consequently a patient can easily feel at home with her. Dr Rituparna treats her patient so tenderly as if they r her sisters. as a doctor she never allows her patients to miss any important test. her sound knowledge seems to be clearly visible through her explanation. I wished for a normal delivery but I cud hardly imagine that she wud spend the whole night at hospital to make sure that to happen in reality. I was overjoyed to have a normal delivery and the credit goes to none but the doctor herself. the advantage of visiting doctor Ritu's clinic is that it is equipped with USG scan machine and one does not keep roaming . I felt she prescribed only necessary medicine and tests and one can easily expect for reasonable expenses. Even during the covid 19 scenario the doctor never deviated from her basic duties. I can't but help sharing one more rare experience with Dr. Ritu that once you acquaint with her, you will always feel her presence in your side somehow as a teacher always stands by her students both in rough times and in palmy days. I strongly recommend all would be mothers to taste a very sweet journey.I am going to miss you mam.. ",

Our quick feedback of Dr. Rituparna Bera - Sarkar based on the interactions in the past 8 months as below, 1. A very confident professional - We are under Dr. Ritu's consultation from the first post-pregnancy appointment to the delivery of the baby. During this period there were multiple confusing times being first-timers in our mind, but not a single time we thought of taking the second opinion. 2. Transparency - She explains complex technical (medical) things in a simplified way with transparency. At the end of the day, you have a clear answer to the current situation and possible scenarios as well. 3. Dedicated time - Her ability and patience to answer any stupidest query are really appreciable. One will not leave the clinic until you are technically/ logically satisfied.  Not sure how she manages to maintain a smile on the face. 4. One-stop solution - The clinic has a scanning facility and it is also linked to diagnostic centers. One can avoid additional stress. 5. Normal delivery - Her constant effort and approach for normal delivery are very appreciable. 6. Network - Doctor is linked to reputed hospital chains like Ovum and Motherhood which gives additional benefit. 7. Availability - Doctor is available on the phone, WhatsApp and accommodative for a walk-in appointment as well. Last but not least, affordable fees & convenient location. Thanks, (Aditi and Shantanu)",

She was given so much confidence that she was in perfect health and cheerfulness all through. It was only when she did her last growth scan at a diagnostic center that we got a bit anxious since it revealed a loose cord around baby\u2019s neck but on meeting doctor with the scan report she assured us there was nothing to worry because everything else was normal and it would be 95% a normal delivery so all was good after that. Her baby was due on the 6th of November but doctor told us that the baby was in position and she could delivery anytime earlier and to continue with her instructions for a normal delivery.As advised prior to her due date my daughter went into labour and Dr. Ritu was by her side attending to her and very supportive right through. When it was time for the baby to be delivered the baby started showing signs of destress as his heart beat started to drop. Dr. Ritu was determined to continue with the normal delivery and get baby out safely as soon as possible. Despite having 2 tight loop of cord around his neck baby was delivered safely. The next ordeal we had to face was the manual removal of her placenta as it failed to detach after the delivery but Dr. Ritu wasted no time in attending to that too despite it being a rare case and saw that the baby and mother were back in good health soon. We couldn't be more grateful to Dr. Ritu and the hospital medical team who supported my daughter and saw her through a safe and normal delivery. We wish Dr. Ritu all the very best and highly recommend her.",

Due to age factor, I was initially worried about going ahead with my 2nd pregnancy. A complete understanding was required before proceeding towards next step. I searched for one of the finest doc who can help me and my husband regarding the same. Thanks to practo for helping me on finding Dr Ritu. As mentioned by many many patients, she is extremely calm and caring doc I have ever met in my life. Yes, because of her only , we decided to go for 2nd pregnancy. Her simple but detail explanation is admirable. Sometime she goes very deep to boost up your confidence. I have no doubt on saying, I met one of the best person in my life. Her confidence and positive attitude is something which brings enormous positivity in life. \nShe preferred minimum medicine and scan. Since I already have one baby, I can correlate and make out the difference. Doctor, from the beginning told me clearly what to do and what not. Specifically in each trimester her advise on food intake was way too good. Even though the distance from my house to her clinic is significantly high still we never felt tried. One the contrary every time I visited her wonderful clinic i became so relaxed. \nFinally after passing 38 weeks of wonderful moments, delivery date came. Believe me, I had no fear because of her only. Similarly my mom and my husband had extremely high conference on her. She did my x-section with utter most care and gave me another best gift of my life.  \nAfter delivery she visited me every day and the caring still continues \ud83d\ude0a. You are truely an amazing doc. Thank you is small word for you. There are many many things which are difficult to write, which you can only feel. So ladies and would be mother just visit her once and enjoy the beautiful journey. No matter what, you will always be there in my heart. I am going to miss my visits mam. Will cherish the memories rest of my life. I definitely recommend her to each and every pregnant ladies. \nAt the end, I would like to thank sister maya, vanaja for your help whenever I asked for. God bless you mam and your lovely team. Keep smiling and continuing wonderful job for society.",

She truly deserves all appreciation and accolades. She is very experienced, professional, calm and friendly in nature. I am really thankful for the way she handled my wife's pregnancy as there were few challanges. However she always gave her positive consultation and made her feel happy and stronger.  She is one with positive attitude towards everything and makes her patients feel comfortable. It doesn\u2019t matter to her if it\u2019s a day or night she will always be there whenever her patients need her (each time she come to hospital she will make sure to visit her patients and check the health status). I asked her \"when do you sleep mam, most of the time you would you be at hospital or clinic and her answer stunned me\". She never asked us for any unnecessary tests and the consultation fee is very minimal. The clinic is well maintained with the best equipment's. She would explain inch by inch about the baby development and show us the movements using ultrasound machine. We don't have to walk out to get any medicine, everything is provided within the clinic. very time you visit and you don't need to run here and there for test and medicines. She found nuchal cord rapped around baby neck, she asked my wife to track the baby movements in a particular time and also shared her emergency contact details. Nuchal cord got off from neck after few weeks by himself. She was tracking down baby growth in every visit and flagged for any abnormalities. She tried  her best to make the normal delivery but due to few challanges at last we had agreed to go for section. Finally we are blessed with baby boy last week and both mother and child are super healthy now.\n\nThank you so much for all the luv and care mam. We really miss your consultation sessions.\n\nYou deserve more awards and respect.\n\nHighly recommended!!!\n",

Dr. Rituparna was warming from day 1 and soon she became our Ritudi ( an elder sister what we call in Bengali) without we became aware of it. She guided us over the process with her valuable suggestions regular scans, timely medicines and relevant injections. Her clinic is well equipped with modern USG instrument (which she operates herself), NST test and medicines and injection. All of these are of utmost importance as the time progresses and may not be always feasible for the patients to do the scans externally. She took care of every single bit of her patient's requirements. She has  an extremely pleasent personallity, which cares the patient and family. She is attached with several well reputed maternity hospitals where the delivery could be done on the choice of the patient. Unlike many doctors, she always insisted on going for a normal delivery if everything is fine. We felt we are in the safe hands from day 1 and that motivates us to regularly travel for more than 15 km one way to visit her. She entertained us over phone and WhatsApp at any given point of time. She got an extremely pleasant personality and calm nature., she used to listen every problem patiently and give relevant suggestion for every problem. She Insisted my wife to send the daily fetal movement counts every day from 30th week.  She has been supportive during the operation( in the OT room) and even sang to console my wife, to overcome the pain and fear during that time. This implies how much confident she is in her area of expertise. Finally, we have been blessed with a baby boy under her guidance. Overall, Ritudi is a complete package that any expecting parents would look for and we sincerely wish her many more successes in the upcoming time.  She has been a blessing to us and many others. Thank you Ritudi!!!",

Pls include more stars.\n\nMarried for more than 9 years and looking for a baby. Treated from big hospitals in chennai with no use. They almost decided to adopt.\n\nThey decided to go for a final try before adopting. Checked in Practo and got to know about Ritu madam. The next 3 months i was pregnant. Below are the reasons why we 200% suggest Ritu madam.\n\n- The way she talks gives you a great confidence. You will feel, yes I am going to have a baby. This is half the treatment. \n\n- Regarding treatment, literally no treatment to me. She just treated for what s required. ** ******** ********* *** ************** She spend around 30 mins for each patient which I don't think other doctors do.\n\n- Very less C-Sections. Ritu madam = Normal delivery. \n\n- Only 2 or 3 scans in whole 10 months. ** ******** ***** *** ********* No panicking the patient. She will tell what is required to be told. \n\n- Very important, you can take your whole family with you for checkups. Every body are welcomed. \n\n- Very nominal fees.\n\n- She owns the patient. More of a family like relationship.\n\n\nThere are too many points to be included but nothing can fully explain the experience we had with her. As the journey is completed, we are going to miss Ritu madam. \n\nNot exaggerating, *** ** **** *** ** *** I never thought i could will have a cute cute baby girl. \n\nNow my return gratitude to her is be her PRO. I am going to call all my friend and relatives who are looking for baby and send them to her. \n\nFinally, Ritu madam said she s a small doctor. \n\nMadam you are a Brand by yourself.",

Ever since our first consultation with Dr. Rituparna, we've started to sense a lot of positivity and absolutely success vibes. Dr. Ritu has been (we're sure she'll continue to) completely patient in listening to my wife's life style and questions, then, Dr. Ritu clarified each and every question comprehensively. Most importantly, Dr. Ritu always explains things with a quick diagram on the white sheet for us to easily connect to what we've been discussing. Doctor never had prescribed too many medications or further unnecessary/irrelevant treatments (or) lab tests. Doctor had always advised the most convenient mitigations for every hurdle that might slow down the process. The way Dr. Ritu explains the reason behind the scans and visits to the clinic is absolutely sensible and satisfying. Despite the medical industry being unreal lately, this doctor had never uttered a word in regard to marketing or promoting. I recommend the most genuine Dr. Rituparna anyday. The journey has been a sheer joy. My wife delivered a baby (guys, please send in your blessings) on 19 December, 2021. We've always knew we are in the safe hands which eventually turned out be true (hence proven). Thanks a million to Dr. Rituparna from us and our family. God bless you for the service you offer to the couples who reach out to you with a lot of hopes and anticipation.",

After hearing us patiently and answering all our queries, we were assured that  we've ultimately reached the right Dr. We were so impressed with the behaviour as well as her patience of hearing we couldn't think of visiting another doctor for a second opinion. Within two months under the the doctor's advice my wife got pregnant. Since then whenever we visited the clinic, we were enthralled with the patience, efficacy & the depth of experience of Dr Rituparna. It was really a beautiful & most satisfactory experience of my life. Every time we visited the Dr no matter how trivial the cause is, the doctor guided us with utmost sincerity & dedication. We couldn't belive the care she took even in time of doing the scans in her clinic. I admitted my wife to the hospital three days in advance but the Dr. never missed to attend my wife in her bed & to encourage for a normal delivery, though we were really sceptical about it , amidst her busy schedule. On the final day of delivery we were amazed to see her coolness, care & efficacy in the labour room.  Finally we were delighted to have a healthy normal baby, though my wife had a lot of complications at the initial stages of pregnancy. We 're really thankful to the doctor for such a nice , perhaps the most beautiful journey of our lives. God bless Dr. Rituparna for serving the patients like us with so much care & patience. We're really great full to you, Dr. Rituparna and wish the very name \" Dr. Rituparna\" Is going to be a ' household' name in the coming days. ",

Dr Ritu was there with us through each and every hard moment.. guiding us.. helping us understand what the complications are.. what can be done and most importantly made us stay positive throughtout the entire time.\n\nMy due date was 29/10 but since the baby had been measurung small and also my cervix was tightly closed.. she decided to go ahead with induction on my weekly checkup on 20/10. I got admitted that day itself and induction procesw started. After the second dose of medicine, my contractions started getting extremely painful and my water broke.. Dr Ritu\u2019s priority was baby\u2019s well being as it was measuring small and small babies do not tolerate labor well.. \n\nAfter almost 14 hours of painful contractions .. my baby heartbeat started dipping a lot and we had to go for a c-section and my baby was safely out in 10 minutes :)\n\nDr Ritu is an amazing doctor who not only listens and addresses each concern but also gives ample time at each appointment. She was in touch with me just like a family member constantly checking on me, my pain, and well being throughout the entire 9 months. Without her guidance and direction, i would have never been able to have a positive mindset throughout my pregnancy. ",

I had breathing issues which made me less confident for a normal delivery.\nBut each time when visited doctor for regular checkups, her words was giving me more confidence. More than me she was more\ndetermined that she will try making it a normal delivery. Their was a chord around my baby, also baby head was little far from\nthe pelvic area which was definitly a matter to be worried. But she was confident enough whatever it is i will be going for \na normal delivery. October 17th was the due date for my delivery. When visited doctor on Oct 11th for regular checkup.\nDoctor told their are chances baby has passed motion so i need to get admitted in the hospital the very next day.\nIf baby had passed motion than chances of normal delivery will be less. But the challenge was babys head was still far.\nI was not getting my normal pain so got the pain induced. Even after the first dose baby head was still far. We where worried.\nBut doctor gave us the confidence that it will be a normal delivery itself. Later second dose also was given.\nEntire night i had to go throught the pain as baby head was far, doctor was their for us monitoring the improvements and\ngiving us the confidence. Finally on Oct 13th morning i had given birth for my baby. As promised by doctor it was a normal \ndelivery. Also my baby was healthy without any issues. Im so glad for taking the right decision of choosing Dr Rituparna as my doctor. \nThank you doctor for being with me for the entire journey of my pregnancy.",

We were planning for a baby and needed some counselling on that as my wife was having chronic UTI. We were worried that it can effect the pregnancy and cause complications. \nBut when we met Dr. Rituparna, she listened to our problem very patiently and She advised little life style modification and very few medicine. We were very happy to meet a doctor like her who is so friendly and gives enough time for the consultation.\nWithing no time, the UTI problem was treated. \nMy wife conceived in the month of December and since then it has been a beautiful journey. \nInitially, during the 1st scan, we got to know that my wife is having short cervical length which may cause complications like late miscarriage or premature delivery. We were very scared but Dr. Rituparna told us not to worry and She is there to take care of this. As per guidance of Dr. Ritu the condition improved and my wife completed her full pregnancy term. It gave us enough confidence. Dr. Rituparna was always there to consult and guide us throughout this journey of pregnancy.\nDr. Rituparna's stepwise approach during this period is one of the best experience we had with her during these 9 months . She doesn't suggest any unnecessary tests and medications which many corporate hospitals do now a days.\nMy wife delivered a Baby girl on 10th September 2021 and both Mother and Baby are healthy and it was possible just because of Dr Rituparna who was constantly guiding us through this 9 month time. It's Dr. Rituparna's constant guidance and motivation which helped my wife to deliver the baby normally without LACS. Although at one point during her labour, my wife almost gave up and she decided to go with LACS but Dr. Rituparna never gave up on her and made her believe that she can do it. She stood by her and motivated her to keep trying as it's a matter of just few moments. \nWe are so grateful to Dr. Rituparna for helping us to deliver our bundle of joy. Thank you so much Dr. Ritu.

First and important thing is that she will patiently listens the concerns. She will not prescribe un necessary scans and Medicines. Our's is moderate risk pregnancy and the way she handled our case is unforgettable.\n\nDue to  this pandemic we thought of doing delivery in Bangalore itself instead of going to Native. After all research in google and contacting our near and dear's, we decided to go with Dr. Ritu because of good and helpful reviews in Google and Practo about her.\n\nWe visited the clinic and in initial Glimpse, we found that Dr Ritu is  our perfect choice. Each and every visit, she build our confidence and she will patiently answer all our queries  by taking time and with good explanations. she  never show any angry or Arrogance towards us. Patience and Smile is her Weapon.  Consultation fees is very less when compared to other Clinic's with this experience and knowledge.\n\nPost delivery support is awesome and always responds to our what's up messages. She made our delivery very smoothly and coordinated with Hospital staff and the delivery package is also with in my Budget.\n\nI already recommended two of my known persons for their pregnancy journey and will continue to do so..\n\nRitu mam..  God bless you and your family with Healthier and Happier life  and once again thanks a lot for showing Heartful of love and caring towards our Pregnancy Journey.",

Dr Ritu made our entire journey so comfortable that we couldn\u2019t even realise neither any single stress nor been as doubtful for anything. She was very calm and encouraging during entire pregnancy and delivery, and coached us through it.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to comment about her medical ability as we do not the qualify to write about that. But few things I must have to mentioned about Dr Ritu -\n\n1. Responsible Enough: We are lucky enough to get someone like Dr Ritu personally call/SMS us during our advance Stages of pregnancy to know about baby movements and moms health conditions.\n\n2. Very much approachable & friendliness: She described each and every concern(even some stupids questions as well) whenever we reached to her even if through call/SMS as well.  She even reached to us to know about our baby\u2019s health even after the delivery(I\u2019m talking about after getting discharge from hospital) as well. I really  appreciate her down to earth and very humble attitude. Our entire journey was in COVID situations and Dr Ritu was very much available during the strict lockdown as well whereas many doctors cancelled their all appointments.\n\n3. Trustworthy: Dr Ritu is someone on whom you can blindly trust. My wife has developed some complicacy(ICP) in her advance stages which can be fatal(we got to know later on about this through different medical articles) for us. But Dr Ritu handled so nicely with her extreme skills  & confidence. finally we are blessed with a beautiful baby with our having any issues to mom and baby. \n\nWe could not even think what was happened if we haven\u2019t met such amazing doctor during our pregnancy. \n\nMany many Kudos to you Ma\u2019am and keep it up so that new parents like us can have smile in our face. We\u2019ve not met God yet but we have met with Dr Ritu *** *** ******* *** ** ******* **** ******* *** *** ******\nThank you once again Ma\u2019am. Thanks for such a wonderful journey.\n",

In the very early stage of my pregnancy, I humbly opted for one of the most coveted hospital, but I was disappointed by the expenditure..I took the decision of changing Doctor. As i was in my 15th week of pregnancy, i was desperate to visit a gynaecologist but to whom? Then I heard of Ritu women's clinic and decided to visit Dr. Rituparna Bera Sarkar. Apparantly she is in her early 40's but her motherly approach justified my choice. i was lucky to have her advice every now and then and she had a wonderful patience of listening the patients without any grudge. Her compassionate approach never let me down even for a single visit. She is so punctual and duty bound that , I can hardly recall if I had to wait for her ever. She hardly prescribes unnecessary costly medicine or irrelevant tests. During emergency, particularly in covid 19 scenario, she even encouraged in tele communication for her pregnent ladies which one can hardly expect. She has a wonderful coordination with sister in clinic and hospital. And sister is also very helpful in communicating with Dr. Ritu mam. The moment you visit the Dr. i am sure , you will always feel that she is with you all the time.  Dr. Ritu always encourages those who likes to have normal delivary. And frankly speaking in my case she waited for long 19 hrs and handed me a baby girl through normal delivery which is really a dream comes true for me. I strongly recommend every aspiring mother to visit Dr. Ritu's clinic and enjoy the journey of motherhood.Thank you doctor once again. ",

Our gynaecologist had advised for going ahead with invasive prenatal testing and informed us that it my be a risk to the fetus. Since this was our first baby we were very worried about the NT scan though we understand it was not a confirmatory test. The gynaecologist with whom we were then taking advice was rude and forcing us to go ahead with risky procedure.\nBut it was our luck at tat time that we found Dr Rituparna mam, who studied all our reports and firstly made us comfortable and helped us in taking NIPT test. She was there with us like a family member in understanding our fear and mindset and guided  throughout our pregnancy time. Even when I was diagnosed with short cervix during my anamoly test , Ritu man took utmost care in performing cervical cerclage on the same night and ensured that I was fine and monitored till I got discharged safely. During this pandemic situation when the whole country was on lockdown, Ritu mam  had ensured we  did not miss any of our medications and routine scan at the right time.  After lots of complications, just because Ritu mam was on our side we were able to deliver our baby boy on 17th Oct. we are really thankfull to her for guiding us like a family member. ** ********* *** ** *** ** *** **** ************* you may go to if you need a safe n secure pregnancy time  as she is available anytime for her patients\ud83d\ude0a",

She has been very humble and patient with me since my first visit. She explains everything in detail. The best thing about her is - she doesn't hide anything from you. If something is wrong then she will clearly convey the same. She wont give false hopes. We used to ask her so many questions (both relevant and irrelevant), but she would never get impatient and use to answer everything clearly. Doesn't matter how hectic her day was, she will still treat you as if you are her first patient for the day. She is never in hurry. She is always available on calls and whatsapp. She use to proactively check on my health when my due date was nearing. I never had any challenges in my First and second trimester but my third trimester was a little difficult where i started gaining unhealthy weight. All the tests were done on time and i had no BP or sugar issues. My baby's growth was also fine. After 38 weeks, my swelling got worse. Doctor decided to pre-pone the delivery so that both my baby and i are in good health. She tried for normal delivery and i was induced twice. But my labor didnt start. Hence, doctor decided to go for c-section without wasting anytime. I delivered my baby within 50 minutes. Both my baby and i are in good health. she visited us many times during our stay in the hospital. And she was also very nice to my family members. I am very thankful to Dr. Rituparna for supporting me throughout my pregnancy. I am also consulting her for my post pregnancy follow ups. I am sure my post pregnancy visits will also go well with her. She is compassionate and caring towards her patients. Would highly recommend her",

During my pregnancy, consultation with Dr.Ritu was the best thing that happened to us.\nThe greatest positive is the Dr.Ritu's ability to listen patiently to the patients about  doubts(silly may be) and explaining the complexities in a very lucid manner.\nMy pregnancy was filled with multiple surprises that I had to go on urgent cervical stitch to early delivery, Dr.Ritu's guidance was the one which made our maternity successful with normal delivery. There are not enough words to thank her, and we are indebted to her, though it's just her job,but the personal care and attention is something which you don't find with all doctors anywhere. \nAlso if there is any doubt or emergency at any time, she is always approachable through phone and WhatsApp, that she would respond in minutes despite her busy schedule.\nOur checkup and consultation during every week or fortnight has been more of a training season mentally as well that a senior or friend explaining things without much fuss,  we also get  mentally prepared for the pregnancy and other things to come. We are totally happy and satisfied to be under care and guidance and we thank you for everything. Never in my dreams, I thought I would have a normal delivery, since I was mostly under rest and did not much of physical workouts, but Dr.Ritu made it possible. \n\nAt times she would call me herself and enquire about health and wellbeing and suggest how to move forward.\n\nI am looking for a paediatrician like her, who is really good at her work and caring/approachable to her patients.",

It was a great decision for us as she was extremely accesible on phone and WhatsApp. No matter how silly my queries were,  she always promptly responded. \n\nIn times of lockdown she kept checking on me via phone and also asked if wanted to visit personally as she opened the clinic once a week.\n\nAll my visits in her clinic were nothing short of being delightful. She patiently answered all our queries and ensured that we are timely updated with any practical risks for the baby. She always made sure that we understand any situation and pregnancy related concerns by explaining in a layman language. We used to look forward to the visits. \n\nMy baby was in breech position at 36 weeks when she recommended us to be prepared to deliver through c section. I was also clearly instructed to rush to the hospital in case my labour starts or water breaks. I followed the instructions exactly when my water broke at 4 AM at 37 week. I called her and kept talking to her throughout, while duty doctor examined me in the hospital. \n\nAs per the examination I did not need an emergency C section so we waited for Dr. Ritu at 7 AM to proceed to the OT.\nMy baby girl was born at 7:40 AM through the procedure lead by Dr. Ritu. I was very calm as Dr. Ritu was with me throughout the procedure, explaining me what was happening.  She also visited me everyday during my stay at the hospital to ensure that I am well prepared to take care of myself and the baby.\n\nMy entire pregnancy was an amazing and memorable journey all thanks to Dr. Ritu.She was compassionate, patient and genuinely caring in all her interactions. We will miss visiting her regularly but she is our obvious choice for an gynaecology visits.\n\nI would highly recommend her.\n\n\n",

Very informative,spent lot of time, regular updates till the baby is born. Striving for natural pregnancy stands out to be the best part. We are always thankful.As we wanted a healthy and safe prenancy we visited Rithu mam when we planned for our first baby and on our first visit to her clinic we felt we are in safe hands. She was very calm, gave time for each patient listening to their concerns. Her guidence helped us in natural conception and we were always encouraged for natural birth. Entire pregnancy I was prescribed with minimal medicines and each tests were explained in detail. Due to covid situation not every visits to clinic was easy but doctor was always there for us over the phone. She took extra care during last couple of weeks of my third trimester where she kept checking on my health and baby movements every alternative days when even I missed to update her. My labour took extra long hours but the positive support and hope I received from Rithu mam was giving us more strength and courage. She was calm and positive and stayed over extra long hours to support us during the delivery. We now have a beautiful and healthy baby and all thanks to Rithu mam for her extra care we never hesitate to recommend her to anyone who needs assistance in pregnancy and gynic issues. we strongly believe in her knowledge and experience and we personally would love to get back to her in couple of years when we plan for our baby number 2. :-)",

In May 2023, I finally conceived, and Dr. Ritu continued to support me every step of the way.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, she was more than just a doctor. Whenever I felt overwhelmed or uncertain, she was there to provide reassurance and practical advice.\n\nNow, thanks to Dr. Ritu's exceptional care, I am blessed to be the mother of a beautiful baby girl.

After our first consulation with Dr. Rituparna mam, Me and my husband decided that we will continue with the same Doctor throughout this pregnancy journey as we felt very comfortable talking to her and most importantly her detaied explanation and assurance to me being pregnant for the first time... Unfortunately I lost my baby in the 7th week of pregnancy due to lack of heartbeat... At that time, Ritu mam gave moral support to overcome that situation... Again I could be able to become pregnant after 7 months in September 2022 naturally with all her instructions and advices.. When my pregnancy began, everything was normal and had no complications. But when I reached 20 weeks, I was diagnosed with short cervix in Nt scan... That day itself Ritu mam advised me to undergo cervical cerclage...I was really scared about the surgery but doctor gave moral support and  said not to worry about the surgery, everything will be alright soon And she performed a small surgery that night itself successfully.. She helped me in each and every phase of this pregnancy journey..There were many ups and downs in my pregnancy but in every stage, she hand held us, gave us the boost that we needed and helped us to bring my little bundle of joy to this world. It is only because of her words and motivation I went thorough this pregnancy journey... With all her instructions and advices, it all went well. We came to 9th month of pregnancy. Our visits frequency stated increasing as the date was closer.On 25th of May, When I went to labour room, I was really very scared and asked my husband and other doctor to go for c section again and again... I was literally screaming and scolding everyone for not agreeing for C section... But seeing Ritu mam walk into the labour room gave me the confidence that i can do it... It is only because of her words and motivation I went through a normal delivery... She delivered our little bundle of joy with utmost care... She is the real Angel of my life... Thanks is very small word to express my gratitude... All the happiness am experiencing as a mother is because of her... I strongly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a friendly, trustable doctor for their pregnancy journey.. Thanks a ton from the bottom of my heart to Ritu mam for everything \ud83d\udc9d And finally I want to share about the staff in Ritu mam's clinic.. They are very kind and very helpful... Am really thankful for all of them for making this journey very comfortable and easy... Thank you so much Udaya sister, Sandhya sister and Sunanda sister... Am gonna miss you all... \ud83d\udc9d With best wishes, Kavya Praveen..",

                "review_text": "We approach Dr rituparna based on online reviews and clinic being near to our place and we made a very right decision choosing her as our gyno.our experience with dr for the past 9months and post delivery has been wonderful. Me and my husband we both stay alone n we both are working. This was our first pregnancy and there is no elder to guide us...so naturally we were dependent on the Dr and Google off course....and we had lot of doubts, silly questions. Now here is our feedback....\n\n1. Dr Ritu always listens to your doubts and queries and answers all your silly questions patiently. She explains complicated medical terms in a very simplified way. She is never in a hurry and gives each and every patient dedicated time.\n\n2. You can discuss your financial condition with her. She understands your situation and gives you a solution. \n\n3. She has a scanning facility and you can do the test at her clinic. The prices are reasonable. She doesn't prescribe lot of medicine.\n\n4. She is constantly available for you. She also replies you on watsapp in case of emergency.\n\n5.she is very punctual so never be late for your visits\n\nNow here is walkthrough of my delivery experience.\n\nMy delivery was schedule on 3rd of July. And my first option was normal delivery...we choose ovum hospital hrbr layout.  so Dr had advised me to start counting baby movements..however on 22nd of June my movements were very less. Usually it should be 5 kicks in an average after every meal within 1hr. But that day it was only 2 after lunch. I messaged Dr and she immediately replied that I can wait and see till dinner. I had dinner at 11pm and waited for 1hr. There was only 1kick now. I informed Dr and she immediately told me to do a NST test. We ran to ovum. By the time the test was complete and we reach home at 2:30 AM. Amazingly Dr was awake so long for me. Next day we visited the clinic and Dr suggested we should get admitted as the movements have become less. I followed her instructions and artificial pain was induced.. since I was trying for normal delivery it was important that normal labour pain should come. But in my case till next day morning the labour pain did not come. I was told that Dr Ritu will come within 2-3hrs and then we can take a call. By the time it was 5:30am 24th June. While I was in pain and was only wishing to see Dr Ritu asap, she was right there in front of me. I was so happy to see her and it was such a relief. My movements were 0 and I wanted to go ahead with c section. Dr Ritu is so well  connected even though nurses were not available but because of Dr Ritu network nurses were there within 5mins and I was immediately taken to the OT. \n\nThanks to Dr ritu's smooth process I delivered a baby girl and her name is DIA. \n\nOne quick tip to the all the husbands: while I was in the OT my husband fell off to sleep only thinking that Dr Ritu is there with me. So would be fathers don't panic and enjoy the  moment.\n\nP:S after the delivery I missed my family , in laws who could not come due to covid. And when there was 100 of phone calls, everybody going about the news I was really missing my mom and right then a beautiful thing happen,Dr Ritu came for a visit....and she told me I want to know how my little angel doing (and she meant me)..\n\n\nThank you Doctor \ud83d\ude0a",

She explains each phase of pregnancy and also the tests and scans to be done. She gives enough time to every patient and does not rush through the appointment. \n\nEven when we got some results (double marker) that were not favorable, she explained both the positive and negative outcomes clearly. She encouraged us to stay positive. We waited for the NIPT results and thankfully the results were normal.\n\nOne big advantage is that Dr Ritu has her own ultrasound device at her clinic and she observes the baby, and we can hear the heartbeat at every consultation. She also performs some of the scans at her clinic. A few scans are referred to other centres.\n\nOne of the main reasons we decided to go with Dr Ritu was that she encourages normal deliveries without any medication during labour. That is exactly how my birthing experience was too. I had a very positive birthing experience and felt really calm once Dr Ritu was in the labour room. She was really organised and meticulous. I knew both me and my baby were in good hands. \n\nWe will forever be grateful to Dr Ritu for such a positive pregnancy and birthing of our second child, our daughter. I highly recommend Dr Ritu to everyone pregnant for a beautiful pregnancy and birthing experience. ",

Her ability to put her patients at ease is truly remarkable, allowing her to make even the most sensitive and uncomfortable discussions bearable.\n\nMy interactions with her have always been excellent. We were expecting our first child and knew very little about pregnancy. We were more concerned about a minor change in the body, but the explanation was clear.\nMy wife was in labor, and I requested a C section, but she refused because the baby's head is fixed and moved for normal delivery, and the way she was consoled, my wife was outstading!\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Rituparna Bera to anyone in need of gynecological care.\n\nWe are so grateful to you, Dr. Ritu, and we will always remember you with great affection!\n",

And there comes my friend who suggested to meet DR. Rituparna because they were going through the same pain and later brought a beautiful  life to the world. He said \"It was all possible because of Dr. Rituparna\". I still didn't believe that. Being said that we met Rituparna for the 1st time and we were asked to take some medications because I was at my peak with PCOD infact I kinda met atleast 7 - 8 doctors already but I couldn't get anywhere close to a solution. It kinda bacame very worse and that's when we met Dr. Rituparna. I still did not take it seriously and i just continued the medication only for 3-4 weeks and I stopped it. I still had PCOD issue after 5 months we decided to meet DR. Rituparna to check on PCOD status.! But that's when Dr. Rituparna made me realise that I was pregnant for 5 months, made me realise that I'm a mother already, made me realise that even I can be a mother, made me realise that I was wrong about her. It's been 4 years and I taught it's never going to possible, but Dr. Rituparna made it possible in just 4 weeks..! She is definitely a miracle and turns out to be a very important and precious person in our life.! Thank you for life..!",

In the initial visit itself we were very happy with the Doctor's knowledge & friendliness. Post initial screening, she confirmed that we can try for a 2nd baby. We thought it would be easy like 1st one(5 yrs prior) but we faced quite few obstacles like hit by Covid 3rd wave, unplanned travel & stressful life. However Doctor remained positive & gave us a lot of confidence. She corrected or suggested new approach based on each tests results. Got conceived by Aug'2022 but it was short lived due to baby been conjoint twins & no heart beat post 6 weeks. We had to abort it & it was a very tough phase. Again Doctor's experience,  positive mindset helped us a lot and finally conceived again by Oct'2022 & each tests were scary for us but fortunately all the results came positive. Doctor guided us well with diet plan, exercise routine & life style changes. As I started with, by Jul'2023 we were blessed with Baby boy & much credit goes to Dr. Ritupurna Mam. \n\nWe would be always grateful for her support and highly recommend her even without a second thought. \n\nKeep up the good service you do to this society Mam and wish you a Happy & Healthy long life!",

The Doctor suggest healthy tips like the foods to avoid, the healthy foods to take, the necessary exercises/walk. I felt all these are very much needed to be adopted in the current lifestyle. The doctor provide less medicines, sya for small problem she also provide some home remedies to follow, and they were very helpful, rather than immediately going for medicines.\nThe doctor always recommend for normal delivery only and finally its our choice. We opted for normal delivery, But in our case unfortunately the baby was in transverse position, finally we had to go for c-section delivery. Dr.Rutu did the surgery, after the surgery I recovered very fast. We are very happy with the doctor and the communication. I strongly recommend  Dr.Rutu.\nThe clinic staff also very friendly and helpful. \n",

On Day-1 itself, Dr.Ritu greeted us with smiles all over and I got that friendly connect instantly. Dr.Ritu brought us into a comfort zone and explained us every aspect on our next steps in detail. With this every consultation was getting better in terms of clarifying every doubt(s) we had in terms of way forward. Like her smile, Dr.Ritu's treatment is also sweet. When we were nearing our Due-date, Dr.Ritu cleared our doubts on practical next steps of hospital admissions, scans and other medical formalities.\nOn the day of delivery, Dr.Ritu was available for us at every moment of our need. Dr.Ritu supported me with her right advices and I had a normal delivery. My joy of having a baby finally happened and today I owe my happiness to Dr.Ritu.\nTHANK-YOU Dr.Ritu...",

She gives each of her patient ample amount of time even though there are so many in waiting always. She explains what we should do and why. She lets you know her plan of action for the next visit.\nShe examined my wife thoroughly and suggested a few steps to follow, put her on a few medicines while also testing all possibilities just in case we need any special attention. On one such test we got to know that my wife had a cyst and had to be removed laparoscopically.\nDr Ritu was so confident and calm about this procedure and assured us that removing this cyst would give us a great chance at pregnancy and performed this procedure with grace and she was right. My wife was pregnant within 2 months after this procedure. Dr Ritu was there with us throughout our pregnancy journey. She made sure that my wife was on healthy pregnant track. She delivered our little bundle of joy with utmost care. \n\nWe are very grateful for having Dr Ritu in our corner throughout. She must be celebrated for her simplicity, calmness, confidence, expertise and patience. Thank you, Doctor!",

Not only with the baby position for normal delivery, she also made sure that baby has proper growth parameters by suggesting proper nutrition and diet. She is very humble in her approach and would provide correct solutions at any point whenever there is a doubt. Her staff members at her clinic are also friendly and helpful.\nMy baby wasn\u2019t at a favourable position for normal delivery, but she stood by my side till the end and ensured that I have a normal delivery without risking mine or baby\u2019s health.\n\nI would recommend Dr. Ritu to every women out there who wants a hassle free pregnancy journey and wants to go for natural birth process. A big shout out to Dr. Ritu for doing so great and making my pregnancy journey a comfortable and memorable one.",

Dr .ritu explained to me about pcos and asked me to change my lifestyle. She did not prescribe me unnecessary tests, scans or medicines , she just gave me few supplements and suggested a thyroid pill to concieve. I made the changes and took medicine for 3 months and i concieved naturally . During pregnancy i wasnt in india and wanted to get delivered  only by her cz i could not trust any other doctor apart from her . In my 8th month of pregnancy when i was back to india , my bp started fluctuating . Dr ritu suggested for early delivery as the bp was not controllable . I delivered normally in my 36th week by her inspite of having grade 1 preeclampsia . She prepared me beforehand for both normal and csec delivery but tried her best for normal . I was induced and delivered a baby boy. I would recommend dr ritu to every woman whose trying to concieve and to pregnant women as shes the most calm , friendliest, dedicated and honest doctor i have come across. She listens to patient's concern and is very patient with every individual. ",

Happy to inform that i undergo with normal delivery process which is very rare in Bangalore now. She has prescribed only minimal medicines and very less tests. She recommended only required medicine and compulsory tests. In other place generally we see lots of unnecessary medicines and tests recommended by doctors.\nThe services that I receive from Dr. Rituparna is just fantastic. Dr. Rituparna and her clinic staffs are friendly and ensure that I am properly informed about my health and care along with setting appointments with doctor in time. I would love to recommend them to friends and family.\nDr. Rituparna is incredible. Not only she has taken great care of my health, but also she is very polite to speak during every meeting. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient! \nAlso, we had a great opportunity to select the best hospital for delivery as DR. Rituparna has connections with many good hospitals like Altius, Ovum, motherhood etc... We took admission in Altius hospital and Dr. Rituparna was always available there whenever ever we need her .\nThank you very much for all your support, guidance and care \u2764\ufe0f\n",

I had pregestational diabetes and gestational hypertension, and weighing around 106kgs at the time of delivery. Her positive attitude, advice and the way she monitored me everyday like asking me to update her my 3 blood pressure readings everyday in whatsapp and she also replies to that. Regular investigations... just the required ones, were suggesed timely. I didn't have many doubts or questions to her, because I always believed in her decisions for me, she gains that through her polite and clear way of explanation.\nLast week I delivered a healthy baby boy with enormous effort from the labour team to make it vaginal delivery but landed in c section due to unavoidable situation which was clearly explained to my family by Ritu mam without panicking them.\nThe foremost important thing in pregnancy is, in whose hands you are in.  I got the BEST!!!!!! forever thankful to her\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\n",

Later I was diagnosed with PCOD, she explained the treatment details, diet and exercise, within 3 months of treatment I was able to conceive naturally.   We then visited her throughout the pregnancy, she prescribed us with minimal medication and lots of positivity. She makes us feel so comfortable with her kind and generous nature, she is very genuine and asks us to do just what is required, nothing extra or fancy. For any issues, she suggested easy remedies * **** ****** ******** My pregnancy journey was super smooth because of her, we never had a second thought as we always felt that my baby and I were in the safest hands. All tests, scanning results were analysed & she gave time for improvements with home remedies before jumping at next steps. Even during the labour, I was calm and composed as she assured not to panic. I finally delivered my baby normally with her support, guidance and confidence she gave. She made regular visits to make sure I was ok after delivery. We totally recommend her for her greatest abilities. I have seen the reviews of her where people mention her as a goddess, angel, and now I myself have witnessed it. ",

Doctor tried a unique solution where she tried to control my wife's PCOS as well as help us in conceiving at the same time. This solution worked for us and we were able to conceive in a few months. When my wife was pregnant, she ran into multiple complications and it was a high risk pregnancy. However, the doctor had a solution for everything, monitored the entire pregnancy very closely and guided us very well in our journey. Towards the end she took the right call on when to initiate the delivery, which ensured safety of both the baby and the mother. My wife had a low Fetal movement and the Doctor did an emergency C-Section at midnight. Doctor has an innovative approach to treatments and has a very calm, composed and positive personality which keeps us relaxed. She is very approachable and kind to her patients, takes good time to explain everything before starting anything. We are indebted to the Doctor for our precious baby girl. We would highly recommend Dr. Rituparna for all your pre and post pregnancy needs.\n\nThank you very much Doctor!!\n\nRegards,\nSneha & Matt",

Prior consulting to madam I almost lost the hope of being a parent due to multiple miscarriage history with my spouse. When I consulted madam for the very first time , I found her approach awesome by which I started gaining confidence back. Though in my case it took 3 years of continuous follow up and treatment with madam but finally we are blessed with a princess and enjoying the parenthood now.I would like to mention some points about Dr. Rituparna madam:1. She is a great listener which makes a lot of difference to be honest in pregnancy complications cases, as per my experience.2. She usually dig deeper into the problem to understand the exact root cause of the problem rather than going with a generic solution/medicine.3. Her way of explaining the problem and solution of the problem is phenomenal. She drew diagrams to explain the things in a better way which makes sense and we were able to understand and relate it well.4. She treats her patients like a family member at the same time she is very rofessional which is a very unique behaviour I found (compared to my previous doctor's).My experience with madam is like you trust her and she'll take care of the things, what work out best for patient. I would recommend Dr. Rituparna 200% because of her behaviour, Counseling and treatment strategies.We are very happy to have her in our life.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

True to the reviews* *** ****** ** ** *** *** **** ***** ** ******** She is very patient and explains everything in detail in such a way that anyone can understand. I usually have a lot of concerns, queries and worry a lot about things, but the doctor gave me confidence and such details that i trusted her completely. She is honest, friendly and gives her true opinion and listens to all our concerns and addresses them. I always had doubt if i was strong enough for NVD, if i will be able to go through it and she helped me deliver my beautiful baby girl via NVD on Oct 12th. Seeing her walk into the labour room gave me the confidence that i can do it. Her smiley face and friendly nature gave me the moral support that i needed throughout. Hands down, i will recommend her to anyone who is looking for a friendly trustable doctor for their pregnancy journey. There were many ups and downs in my pregnancy but in every stage, she hand held us, gave us the boost that we needed and helped us to bring my lil angel to this world. A million thanks to the doctor from the bottom of my heart \ud83d\udc96",

She explains the importance of every test or scan before we proceed proceed with it along with the next steps so we are aware of everything regarding it.\n\nDelivery was very well planned. She tried her best for normal delivery and dint want to give up. \n\nAt the end, baby's head was swelling and the doctor took the right decision at the right time to do a c section.\n\nBelieve me or not, i dint feel like an operation at all. It was so smooth and painless.\n\nIt's more than a week now after delivery and I'm absolutely fine with not much pain.\n\nBest part is her hospitality, she visited me every day at the hospital before going to her clinic and spoke so well. \n\nHer smile and positivity kept me going.\n\n\nIf you find out you are pregnant, i highly recommend to choose Dr Rituparna as your doctor.\n\n\n",

She is too patient and listed our problems calmly. I had a bad history in my 1st pregency so i had alot of doubts. She gives alot of advice and explained me in details. (Possible root cause and lots..)\n\nConsidering my previous case he asked me to do some blood tests, some specific scan and come back after we went to her with report she explained me the problems in a very simpler manner which i can understand asked me to continue some specific medicine and stop some medicine.\n\nEvery month we had a fixed appointment with Dr. Rituparna. Under her supervision and guidance my journey began. And i got her constant help, support and proper guidance.\n\nIn emergency i got admitted in 1 Oct night due to water break. And she delivered my baby safely. Thank you soo much madam, with out your support my pregnancy would have been a nightmare.\n\nI'm very pleased with my choice to have Dr.Rituparna.",

As first-time parents, we had many doubts and fears, which were clarified with lots of patience and promised with a smile. She did not ask for unnecessary tests and medicines and suggested only required things to prepare for normal pregnancy. She is always reachable and will answer all the queries over the phone / WhatsApp. She also understands the financial implications of unnecessary tests and investigations, so she will not suggest unnecessary tests & medicines.\n\nAs the days/months passed, the Doctor decided to operate at the right time. Finally, on 15th August, my wife delivered a healthy baby Girl. Both mother and baby are now fit and fine. We are very thankful to Dr. Ritu Mam. I strongly suggest the Doctor to anyone looking forward to a Gynecologist. She always stands by her patients, not only as a doctor but as a friend. \n\nShe maintained transparency and educated us about every course of treatment. Her patience and dedication towards her patients and profession are commendable. Dr. Ritu Parna Mam is a great doctor in high demand, which translates to waiting time, but it was worth it. We are very thankful to Mam and her team.",

But Dr Ritu has given us the confidence and necessary medical support to go through the critical period. She kept the option of natural delivery open. she guided us through the process of various scans and provided valuable information. my wife was sharing daily movement count to her. Once we decided on cesarin based on the baby position, the delivery was well planned and Dr Ritu was available all the time to confirm the details of admission time, delivery time on the pre-planned date. on 3rd Sep, the delivery happened and we are blessed with a healthy baby boy in Ovum hospital. The doctor visited us regularly during our stay in the hospital. we are thankful to Ritu for making our dream come true. She is a true professional with genuine care for her patients. I strongly recommend Dr Ritu for Pregnancy check ups and delivery.",

The last doctor we went to suggested 30 injections for my wife is she gets pregnant again.  So we came to See Dr Rituparna instead. And when my wife became pregnant, she never suggested any injections. Confidence issues were there for my wife after the 2 miscarriages about holding on to the fetus, but Dr Ritu never treated her like a patient, just a normal pregnant person which was most reassuring for us. We always have a lot of questions given the amount of time we had spent in this but unlike other doctors, Dr Ritu was always patient, answers every question and in such a reassuring way. Very rare to find a doctor like her these days. Even when baby's position was not exactly right or when the baby has 2 rounds of chord around its neck, she always gave us confidence that it will be alright. And finally when the delivery turned from normal to C Section because the baby's head got stuck in my wife's pelvis, she kept her cool under severe duress and delivered us a beautiful baby boy.

She\u2019s always been very positive, friendly and easily approachable throughout the whole phase. It is only because of hers words and motivation my wife went thorough a normal delivery and we are blessed to bring a baby boy to our life.\n\nI want to highlight our experience here:\n- Waiting time in the clinic was between 15-30 min.\n- Consultation charges are only rs 400 which is quite affordable.\n- Spent ample time with us and gave us proper guidance.\n- No unnecessary tests or scans were prescribed by her.\n* *** ********* **** **********\n- Again, it's only because of her words my wife went though a normal delivery which is what we really wanted.\n\nWe are extremely happy and I\u2019m running out of words to show our gratitude to her.

I had few smaller issues Throughout my pregnancy and doctor always gave good suggestions and helped me. In my case normal delivery was little difficult due to my height, baby\u2019s weight and baby\u2019s position But Dr. Ritu did not give up on me and she insisted that we can try for normal delivery and voila we were successful and I delivered my baby normally.\nI will forever be grateful to Dr. Ritu for being such an amazing human and Doctor.

Listens patiently and gives dedicated advice to patients by taking sufficient time and understanding the patient concerns\n3. Always available and during my third Trimister made sure she responds no matter with the time and always reachable during emergency \n4. Getting a Normal delivery is a big deal currently.

Very very punctual and very soft spoken to patients and makes us feel very comfortable and provides scan at her own clinic on each visit and constantly checking on baby movements and health.\nBased on my first and best pregnancy experience, suggested all my family and friends to visit this gynecologist for the related consultation.

I had got low AFI from seventh month of my pregnancy. Even after all possible medications, my AFI did not improve much but Dr. Ritu mam has handled the situation leading to normal delivery which other doctors wouldn't have. \nWhen other doctors suggested to deliver my baby early through c-sec, Ritu mam has handled the risky situation and made me deliver my baby at ninth month through normal delivery. \nShe has suggested all possible ways for normal delivery at all situation. \nShe also doesn't suggest any unnecessary scan or blood tests. \nShe was there supporting me in labor room throughout till my delivery which was in midnight. \nIn clinic, sometimes when many patients are there, wait time might be little much upto one hour but trust me it is very worth waiting which can be realised when you consult her. \nWe are very thankful and would consult her hereafter for any gynaecology related and recommend her for everyone.

She knows what is best for every week of pregnancy and she advices accordingly. Ma'am listen to there patients concerns or problems so carefully and same time she explains so well won't be in hurry though patients waiting outside she take complete time to explain. \nShe don't ask to do unnecessary tests neither call you unnecessary to clinic unless and until it is necessary or depend on ur health and baby.  Best part what i love about ma'am is she is too friendly and supportive.\nShe knows what to advice for every week, this is my 1st pregnancy journey with ma'am and i must say it was memorable moments. I had cervix issue wherein the head of my baby was not fixed, but ma'am gave her best and today I am a mother of little angel and that was a normal delivery.\nThe best part of my delivery was ma'am was almost awake for whole night and kept checking on mine and baby health wit duty doctors and advising them what should be the next.\nAnd finally had a healthy girl baby. After i shifted to my ward ma'am personally comes inside and check my health and baby and that was so sweet. \nOverall i can say is she is best gynecologist with great great experience and offcourse very friendly doctor. I already recommended my 2 friends and they are so happy with ma'am behaviour. Thank u so much Ritu ma'am it was awesome. ",

Ritu. from the day 1 of consultation, till my wife delivered the baby, it was a roller coster ride experience for us... There were months where my wife's pregnency ran into bit of complications, but Dr. Ritu was always there to help us n guide us   and was very professional at her job.\n\nThis gave us the much required confidence. The best part about her was her insistence on having a normal delivery, n to her n my wife's credit, we had a normal delivery.\n\nAlso I must mention the personal time she invest on attending each patient and ensuring all their concerns r addressed.\n\nShe cares for her patients, n that shows in her conduct. We were getting discharged frm hospital post our babies delivery, n Sheridan was very kind to pay us a personal visit to check on my wife's n kids health out of her busy schedule which felt very nice.\n\nU r doing god's work Dr Ritu. May god bless u wit loads of success.\n\nIf any couple wants to hav normal delivery, I highly suggest them to meet Dr Ritu.",

It was my first visit and very happy for the follow up sessions.\n\nOne negative thing I faced in the clinic was the receptionist's attitude. She is unfit for the role for the following reasons:\n\n1- First impression was worse because I wanted her suggestions in terms of waiting time because I had left my year old baby at home and she didn't even empathize rather just ignored my question telling just wait.\n\n2- She never had change of Rs. 100 to return me. She arrogantly told me \"what can I do?\" I was shocked with her behaviour and told her what if I go away without paying, she never answered for that but kept telling, what can she do about not having change and also told why should she get up from her place to get the change. I was upset and shocked with her behaviour. Finally, listening to our conversation the medical girl from inside arranged for the change from diagnostics person.\n\n3- The receptionist doesn't carry smile while attending the visitors. After all the patients come with different ailments and would require some positivity as soon as they enter which is not seen. Only after visiting the doctor we would feel a sigh of relief.\n\nPlease train the employees on customer service and soft skills. This is definitely a barrier between the patients and the doctor which I feel is not good especially at the hospital. ",

Right from the first month, Dr. Ritu had explained all the do's and don'ts. A diet plan was also provided to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy. Dr Ritu has always been professional and never suggested unnecessary tests and scans. She also explains very clearly the risks and how to mitigate them at each stage. Her patience is what makes us feel comfortable to ask any doubts and questions. She listens very patiently to what we say before responding, which is very consoling.During the third trimester, doctor was in constant touch with us and responded to our queries without fail. The whole pregnancy experience was smooth because of this. She also turned up at the hospital many times to check up on my wife, as soon as she got admitted and was also there as soon as it was time for the delivery. Though there was a slight complication during delivery, doctor handled the situation smoothly and pushed for a normal delivery, with both baby and mother being safe and healthy post delivery.It's also worth noting that her clinic charges are comparatively lesser than other clinics and hospitals.I highly recommend consulting Dr.Ritu for  women's  health related issues and pregnancy.",

Right from my childhood, I always wanted to become a mother, but I never knew how many changes would happen to a woman\u2019s body during the pregnancy. But doctor, you made it an amazing journey for me. We came to your clinic for prenatal counselling, the consultation you provided helped us conceive quickly and safely with all the vaccines taken. Everyone I know says, the first trimester is hard but the medicines you provided helped me overcome nausea and morning sickness easily. From then on, every consultation you provided helped me overcome the challenges of pregnancy with much more ease. You were always honest with me and alerted me whenever I needed to take extra care, like when I had the chance of getting GDM. Whenever I visited, I felt understood and encouraged. You have motivated me several times when I felt down and the hormones were working on me. Finally, the 9th month had been so crucial and you guided me well towards normal delivery. As you mentioned to me in my last consultation, this is our family's achievement and words are not enough to express our gratitude towards you. Thank you so much. You are an inspiration to\nwomen like me and I wish our baby girl becomes an inspiring personality as you someday.",

Regular check-ups and follow-ups were conducted at her clinic.Dr.Rituparna encouraged us for normal delivery and also explained each and every concern of ours.She is someone on whom you can blindly trust. At the time of delivery  Dr Ritu tried her best for normal delivery but there was some complicacies after a prolonged labour period and hence she had to do an emergency C section.She handled  the  situation nicely with her experience, skills & confidence.Finally we were blessed with a little angel.Thanks a lot Dr. Rituparna for all the support, guidance and to always keep an watchful eye throughout my pregnancy.",

She made it sure from the very first day it to be a normal delivery and provided us with a complete pathway for it. During the entire tenure of pregnancy we did not felt any short of complication and risk and it was quite a smooth process and as I said earlier we planed for normal delivery and it was a normal for me as well. Moreover she was there on the side during delivery and also guided me post delivery. Dr Rituparna is definitely a few doctors we look up to and she did a fabulous job. She is one of the best gynecologist in Bangalore and highly recommend from my side. We are grateful to the doctor for her effort. ",

She listens to our concerns and clarifies them clearly. I was able to move freely with her and ask any questions without any hesitation. I felt strong and brave around her. \n\nIn the final visits of pregnancy, she could guess that mine could be an early delivery and she took the necessary extra care regarding that. Finally her guess proved to be right.\n\nShe prefers for normal delivery which I also wanted from the beginning. She gave the necessary tips on diet and exercises that helped me a lot. On the final day, she gave us a lot of support and strength when I was in the labour room. She boosted my confidence that I can withstand normal delivery. Finally I delivered normally which I would cherish my entire life. \n\nI feel great to have Dr. Ritu as my doctor and will happily suggest to all my friends and family. Thanks a ton to Dr. Ritu for helping us throughout this beautiful journey.\n",

When I went to consult her regarding my PCOD, her only suggestion was to make lifestyle modification and she didn't give any tablet. As per her advice I followed lifestyle changes, within two months my PCOD issue was gone. So when we planned for pregnancy,we visited her. She was always our lucky charm, we got pregnant and we decided to continue consulting in her clinic. She always listen to my concerns / doubts and provide correct suggestions. Moreover, she always foresee issues and suggest proactive methods to avoid it. She is very much reachable through WhatsApp or over call whenever there is a concern. From day 1 , She always push for normal delivery and suggest various exercises and keep ourselves psychically active. I would recommend her to everyone who is looking for smooth pregnancy journey . Coming to our pregnancy journey, I followed all her diet and exercises which she recommended. Also we had access to physiotheraphy sessions via video conf through her contacts. Everything helped me in the delivery. When I got my pain, I called her and she asked me to get admitted in hospital. Within 1 hour of my labor she delivered our baby boy carefully and kept the whole labor process smooth. Will be always thankful to her. ",

Initially there were certain concerns in my pregnancy..but Dr. Rituparna's guidance and diligent follow up ensured all these concerns were resolved before I approached my delivery date. Dr. Rituparna will always give you a holistic overview of every issue with proper guidance but will ensure you take the final decision. The odds of me having a normal, full term delivery were really bleak which Dr. Rituparna did explain to me very clearly without hiding any facts. But, she never did give up on me and eventually I did have a full term (37 weeks) normal delivery. Dr. Rituparna has been and is very dedicated and deeply involved in her profession. It is very evident in the way she tries to resolve all queries and issue that pop up during your pregnancy. I am glad to have found A gem of a preson and an amazing Doctor for life I\nVia Practo! ",

As this was our first pregnancy and we had lot of queries related to every little things we wanted a doctor who would listen to us patiently and guide us through our journey. She was our 3rd gynecologist during our journey of pregnancy. We started consulting her from 2nd trimester and she made us so much comfortable whenever we visited her that we started to feel that she is less of a doctor and more of a mentor and elder sister to us. She never rushed and gave us enuf time every time we visited her and explained all queries we had. She motivated us all through our pregnancy and guided us even with the smallest of details.During our stay at the hospital she visited us 2-3 times everyday and made sure that my wife and baby are doing good. Even after the delivery as well she keeps on checking on the health of both mother and baby at regular intervals.We are very glad and blessed to have her by our side during one of the most important phase of our life. Thank you so much mam for all ur guidance and support. \ud83d\ude0a",

Her diagnosis was spot on and when that was done, she had the solution ready. Dr. Ritu was understanding and caring from day one and I am really glad I met her. She helped me clear all my worries and I think I am tension free now and She is very patient and explains everything very clearly. She will not let you take unnecessary medicines. And such doctors are rare to find.\n\nI am so glad I choose Ritu Women's clinic and I would highly recommend to anyone.\n\nThe care that I received from Dr.Rituparna Bera Sarkar is excellent.She is one of the most humble person we have come across.She always ensure that I am properly informed about my health.\nI would have no qualms in recommending her to friends n family.\nShe is blessing to many. \nThank you once again dear doctor.",

I am thankful that i landed in the correct place .. i got a good feel as soon we entered we were greeted by the receptionist ( Vanaja) , she was courteous , respectful and very caring she understood that this our first visit ever to a gynaecologist for pregnancy she took all our details and set our appointment. So when i met  Dr Ritu she answered us very patiently as we came with the silliest of doubts :).. once Doctor started explaining the entire stages of pregnancy step by step we gained confidence decided that she is the doctor for the pregnancy ..after which we have done many visits so far and nothing is changed we still have the same level of good experience when we walk in to the clinic each time. Dr Rituparna takes at the most care possible and patiently explains each step for us. I Respect her dedication and care which she takes for each patient.",

There are many positives  which we can talk .Most important are below according to me \n1) The way in which madam explains about every thing in detail\n2) very friendly \n3) will listen to every problem\n4) availability in phone during last trimester\n5) post pregnancy's support\n\nit is my second pregnancy's during which i visted ritu madam   . During my first pregnancy's I went to my home town . I had really tough time handling post surgery pain . This time it was very smooth . I was  able to walk on second day morning by my self. It was a big achievement for me considering the fact that i had to take help of my husband ,father and nurse to walk during my first pregnancy's and that to with huge pain .\n\n\nwe are very happy and feel very lucky to get treatment from madam . we really miss visiting clinic . \n\nthank  madam for all the support through my pregnancy and making it a memorable journey .",

She is extremely humble and polite human being with a heart of gold.\nWe went by Practo recommendation and visited Dr Ritu for the first time in Feb 2020 and from then there was no looking back. Soon national lockdown was announced and my NT Scan and few crucial tests were to be done but due to lockdown it was very difficult to find a lab, Dr Ritu arranged everything and made sure all my scans and tests are done timely and smoothly. The love and compassion she has towards new parents and baby is just remarkable. \nShe made me stick to natural sources of nutrition without giving any unnecessary supplements. Dr Ritu helped me maintain a very active lifestyle, optimum level of body weight and a positive mindset.In the last few weeks she helped me prepare my body for normal delivery. This made my delivery process very smooth, my labor was short, no epidural was required and I delivered normally with Dr Ritu, her team and my husband by my side. \nThank You for everything Dr Ritu \nI already miss coming to your clinic.

She advised for regular checkup and to be careful about everyday food intake. Having USG scan facility in her clinic I didn't have to travel that extra mile. I was under her medication for the entire pregnancy. Dr. Rituparna has a very sound knowledge and tremendous practical experience of c-section. She is so efficient that within  a couple of weeks after my c-section, I felt almost normal. Dr. Sarkar is so well behaved and careful about her patients that a patient can easily open her heart before her without any hesitation. She is very sympathetic and dutiful to her patients. I had a wonderful experience and  sweet memory throughout  the entire journey of my pregnancy under the watchful eyes of Dr. Rtuparna. Out of my heart-felt experience, I strongly  recommend  to visit the doctor's  clinic and see the difference in your own eyes. God bless Dr. Rituparna Bera Sarkar.",

I decided to go ahead with Dr. Ritu only since I always felt I am in safe hands. She always take care of mine as my elder sister. I have never seen her in hurry while checking patients. She stays very very calm and very soft spoken. Apart from her experience, I must salute her surgical skills as well. Whatever she told me to follow , I tried doing my level best and at the end of the day we got good result. My delivery experience with Dr. Ritu was amazing. C-section was completely uncomplicated. Me and my son both were doing extremely good. I have rarely seen Doctor calling patients and asking health, specifically at 3rd trimester. My feelings of those moments can't be explained in words . It's beyond. Good bless you Doctor. Society needs more doctor like you. Even during the time of pandemic I have seen how you are giving your best to all your patients.Thanks for everything doctor.",

Dr. Ritu is not just a gynecologist but also, she supports mentally and emotionally in the low times. \nShe treated me as a younger sister. Also I would like add that she prescribes safe medication. \nDuring my treatment of endometriosis, she gave me moral strength. \nOverall, she is not just a doctor, she is a Godsend. \n***Please do not miss an opportunity to see such person, if you are looking for an Obstetrician/Gynecologist without any second thought.\nI am unfortunate for not being able to continue my treatment as my husband relocated to a different place because of work.\nI am looking for Dr. RItuparna in every other Gynecologist I am seeing, which might be impossible to find. \u2639\nWe would like to thank Dr. Ritu for her unconditional support and guidance throughout the treatment.

The level of personal touch, care and confidence you get from her is unmatched. \nThis was my first pregnancy and like most of us, I had several doubts and prejudices. Right from the start, I found her extremely calm. I used to ask her innumerable questions, yet she had answered all of them. \nMid of my pregnancy came covid. Even then, I found her taking all precautions & delivering her best (being in protective clothing for so long without losing calm is never easy!)\nDuring the delivery time also, she was very supportive what she promised for.\nI cannot recall a moment in these 9 months when I needed her and did not find her available. \nOverall I will give her my maximum recommendation.\nIn short, below is how I conclude\nR- Responsible\nI- Intelligent \nT- Talented \nU- Understanding \nP- Peerless\nA- Amiable\nR- Respectful\nN- Nice\nA- Assertive",

Her professional, yet warm and transparent demeanour made us realise we had found ourselves in good hands. She was knowledgeable, yet patient enough to rest my fears and answered all my queries to my utmost satisfaction. She also had her own scanner which made it easier to get checked except for the anomaly scan, thus helping her to take a call when the situation required without us having to run back and forth to and from the diagnostics and doctor\u2019s office. Throughout our pregnancy we were faced with different hurdles, like higher than normal blood pressure, less amniotic fluid, less growth and finally less movement if the baby. All these were carefully managed and never once did we feel that things were out of control. When the d-day came, Dr. Ritu handled my labour and delivery very well, with a good head on her shoulders, even staying the night at the hospital as my labour was long. She ensured that I got the right care at the hospital.\nI am very happy with Dr. Ritu\u2019s services and would definitely recommend her to my family and friends. Thank you Dr. Ritu!\n",

After seeing many Dr I was not getting any satisfactory result  also last dr told me that I can not become mother only option left for me was IU. Somehow i didn't believe that and thought of taking 2nd opinion from another dr and luckyly i heard of Dr Rituparna and went her clinic with my husband.\nTrust me!!\nAfter first consultation I was very satisfied and got very positive vibes from her. She was so friendly n  polite n  explain everything in details , consultation takes 1 hour.\nAfter two consultation  I had conceived and\non December 7th I gave a birth to a girl child.\nWe are grateful to Dr Rituparna any very much satisfied with her treatment.",

My wife journey of pregnancy was wonderful with Ritu ma'am and it was safe and normal delivery. We had 2 boys and 3rd baby is our little princess for which we were eagerly waiting for. Inspite of a long 8 years gap Ritu ma'am gave her best to have a normal delivery, we lost hope and opt for c-section but hats off to our beloved Dr Ritu ma'am it was all possible only by her positive mind set. I thank you ma'am for everything u gave us either it may be a moral support or physical one. We are blessed to have you as my Dr. Words are too less to express about u ma'am. \nThank you sooo much.",

She is such a dedicated, soft spoken person who has more patience in listening to our queries. \nMy pregnancy journey was very smooth as I was guided perfectly. Not just that, my water level was quite low. Still it was possible for normal delivery just because of Dr Ritu. I went through 27 hours of labour, where there were more chances of C-section, but still Dr Ritu gave first preference for normal delivery.\nThe best doctor in town who gives first preference for normal delivery if the patient cooperates. We were blessed with a baby boy on October 31 (normal delivery). \n9 months of clinic visit has come to an end, which we kinda missing.\nAnyway, thanks Dr Ritu for not only being a doctor but also as a friend. \n\nHighly Recommended !!",

Went to many doctors, temple s in both Bangalore and Chennai nothing worked. Then finally in Google search found Dr Rituparna and with final try went to her . She was welcoming and explained what might be the delay in pregnancy etc. Based on medications started in February 2020 . And next month unfortunately stuck with lockdown and we had to delay our checkups again . Then went again in may month. All she had given was medications and no unnecessary tests. Finally July 12th we came to know about our little ones pregnant confirmation. To our surprise it was  twins and more than us she was happy . From there on we had frequent checkups and followed all her suggestions and advice . She was always reachable any time of day , I still remember when I had to what's app midnight and got instant replies and suggestions. The expected delivery plan was march 26. But our little ones came out on march 17 th itself. Again my wife had a pain on march 16th at11.30 pm and I called her immediately. She picked up and confirmed it's delivery pain and needs to do c sec . She came to cloud nine hospital immediately and at 2.15 am and finally both my little ones came out safely . I just cannot simply thank her , it should be more than that . I pray for her health and long life to continue helping others like us.\n\nNote : her fees for check ups are very minimal and she herself does follicular scans and NST. She explains all your queries patiently\n\nAlso the receptionist vanaja is very helpful *** *** **** ********* ** ***** ***** * ***\n\nThanks again mam",

We were in the phase where we were trying to conceive, wasn't successful and tried many doctors and the doctors whom we reached out to did not give us that confidence /hope or personal touch which only Dr Ritu could give during our first meet. Her conscientious guidance, detailed explanation for each and every treatment/medicine, caring and showcasing superlative expertise is what I experienced through out!   Her personal touch and willingness to spend time with her patients explaining the situation is a welcome trait and with thyroid and  prediabetic condition  finally conceived with her continual support & treatment.Once i got pregnant then came few challenges each trimester bleeding spots around baby sac,pre-eclampsia, high blood sugar, 2 chords around baby neck etc etc which we were able to sail through since she was letting me know what is/was going on in regular language and not in \" typical doctor's language which sometimes sounds like leman language\" during our prenatal visit.Thank you doctor Ritu for the wonderful birthing experience, no words are enough to appreciate the service you do.Your talent and caring manner is a credit to the medical profession.Also thanks to her team whom I met during my delivery in ovum and they exceeded all our expectations. You will always have the highest regards for giving us the support and guidance through out our journey. Ever grateful for you!",

Where i can book appointment and share my doubts with her assistant. I do not know her name but she is also a very quick responsive ,genuine and helpful person.No attitude, very proactive and friendly.I am thankful to her also..\nMy baby movement was very less so everyday my task was to send her baby movements count every night before going to bed.She did acknowledge and asked me to go for NST when required.\nPost delivery my blood vessels were bleeding a lot and required more time than usual for the stitching.\nIt was possible only because i was under a fabulous Surgeon Dr Ritu.It took me some weeks to get over the pain and burnings of Vaginal stitches.But the medications given by Dr Ritu really did great wonders...\nThank you so much Dr Ritu Ma'am .If in future i plan for second child,i would like to do again under your guidance..\nI am blessed with a healthy baby boy..Enjoying my motherhood...\nI wish all expecting women and Mothers a happy life with their child/children..",

And I decided , I will come to her only for any problem. Her words worked like magic during that time. I was having minor PCOD issues as well. Doctor suggested medicine is not the only solution, physical fitness plays a key role. And believe me, I got pregnant within 2 months of our planning.  The 10 months journey was awesome.  I never thought I would get such a valuable person in my life during the entire journey every moment. The focus never sifted from requirements. She always always encouraged me for normal delivery. She always shared her motherhood journey experience with me which inspired me all the time for normal delivery. One of the significant things is, no matter how tired she is , she will never let you down. I have hardly seen one person so much dedicated towards her patients. During the covid time , I have seen her seeing patients for hours wearing ppe kit and she still smiles all the time. Her clinic is equipped with a USG scan machine which is the best part of the journey. I never had to run here and there multiple times .  I followed her suggestion, and I delivered the baby boy normally.  I can tell you ladies one thing. If you follow her suggestions word by word the result will be awesome for sure.  At the middle stage , I thought of going back to Chennai, my hometown but just because of Dr. Rituparna I stayed back at Bangalore. She made my life easy.  Not only me, My family members also like her very much and specifically my mother feels doctor is like her daughter only. There are many many sweet memories which will always be there in the core of my heart and will remain there with me. Thank you doctor. Thank you for everything. All the best to all would be mothers. Enjoy the moment , enjoy the journey.",

She is one of the finest Gynecologist I have ever met. Prior to her we met multiple doctors but we were not comfortable with their approach and behavior. She is very friendly, approachable and welcoming in nature which makes us very comfortable on every consultation. She patiently listen to our problems/queries and gives lot of moral support and boost our confidence throughout the pregnency. She examines patients thoroughly, explain all the reports in details and guide accordingly by ensuring all our doubts are cleared. She ensure unnecessary medications are not given to the patient. She would take interest to interact with us which helped improve the patient doctor bonding. This has enhanced our comfort zone with her. She is just a message/phone call away whenever we needed her in any queries. When we consulted mam, my wife had PCOD and irregular period cycle. She has treated her so well that in 2 months time we got the good news. We had full faith in mam and listen to her suggestions and advices. Although there were some complications in the pregnency, she has diagnosed and guided us extremely well. She has constantly monitored my wife and baby every month and every week when we were closer to the due date. Finally at Ovum hospital under mam's supervison along with team of doctors and nurses, our healthy baby was born.Mam, thanking you will not be enough. We are very fortunate to meet you and because of you this entire journey was successful and exciting. Me and my family will be extremely grateful to you. ",

She always treated me like a family member rather like a younger sister.\nI was about to finish my first trimester when Mam has happened to us. I was not happy with the Dr. I approached initially and decided to change the Dr. The best thing I really like about mam is that she explains each and everything.\nDuring my second trimester, I have been diagnosed with Diabetes that too at its peek of 586. Mam has played a vital role in controlling my sugar levels, I have got admit in the hospital and whole night mam was checking the sugar levels and insulins to treat sugar. After discharge also she kept track on my sugar readings by regular follow ups and we ended up with the controlled sugar levels. She stood there for me 24x7 as she was just a message away for any of my queries and doubts. \nShe has than planned my delivery and gave me favourable medications which are best for me and baby so that at the time of delivery there would be no complications and as promised she successfully helped me in delivering my baby with normal procedure of delivery at my 37th week.\nI have only heard that doctors are like Gods until I met Ritu mam. She is the perfect example for the same. \nHere are few checkpoints about mam every new would be mother would like to go through:\n1. Explains the process and the scans very well as you will get full idea why the tests and scans are happening to you.\n2. Always available at anytime of the day and very much approachable as she is just a message away.\n3. She is in the good term with other specialists also who would be needed for the particular scan and as a result those Drs also treat you like there own patients \n4. She supports thoroughly at the time of any mishaps. And get through you with the problem.\n5. She delivers what she promises.\n6. After delivery also she keep on checking what the status is every week. \n7. Mam is such a soft hearted person as she will make you feel like your own sister so that you can discuss anything with her without any hesitation.\nAt last I have got my baby\u2019s guardian angel... Me and my husband along with our families can\u2019t thank you enough for what all you did for us. \n\nShilpi",

Unfortunately since 2016 till 2021 we couldn't find the right treatment and even  many doctors advised us to go for IVF which we both weren't ready for... Luckily one of my friend recommended Dr. Rituparna mam during 21-22 and we started taking treatment . The day we met her first time we knew we were in good hands and we just followed her treatment and believe me during the treatment Dr. Rituparna has never advised for IVF infact she always tried to make us understand that pregnancy would be possible if we just follow the treatment properly which we did and December 2023 by God grace blessed with a baby girl... For us Dr. Rituparna Bera Sarkar is nothing less than GOD. \nI will recommend all parents planning for baby should once visit her clinic. Even for complete women's health care treatment you all can visit her. \n",

I have great respect and immense gratitude for the kind of care and support she has given me since my first consultation with her a year ago for my pcod until I delivered my second baby by conceiving naturally and giving birth through normal delivery. All this was possible because of Dr.Ritu. My husband and I visited multiple doctors for my pcod issue but we never got the results. Then, through Google reviews we went to Dr. Ritu, she is a doctor with right acumen, perfect prognosis and apt treatment. She never dumps unnecessary medicines on her patients, doesn't suggest unnecessary tests, she's very humble, understanding, friendly and highly approachable. Talking to her alone feels like most of our problems are resolved. Thank you Dr. Ritu for coming into our life.",

Doctor gave the required treatment in combination with Life style changes and within 3 months we started to expect our second baby.\n\nDuring this period Doctor Ritu took utmost care of my wife and gave us the needed confidence throughout the journey till delivery. On October 16th doctor helped my wife to deliver a girl baby through normal vaginal delivery procedure. Doctor was giving the best personal care to my wife during this period. \n\nThe best part during the entire duration was Doctor Ritu was suggesting more natural supplements rather than medicines\n\nWe would like to thank doctor Ritu for helping us to become parents once again.",

She gives time for all our queries  and clarifies all things in the  way we understand. She is very friendly and greets everyone with warm smile always.  She is a person with abundant knowledge on every complication and knows how to treat.\nShe will not go for procedures directly. She always gives time and encourages on natural conception and normal delivery. She will go for procedures only if needed and after giving enough time. She observed me in labor for 14 hours and then only took the call for C-section as there was not much progress and also my full term of 40 weeks was completed and cant wait further. I will definitely recommend her to every women whatever the concern/situation is. Thank you so much Ritu mam for being there all through the pregnancy and the journey was easy and wonderful with you. Looking forward meeting you  again for my second pregnancy.",

She answered all our questions and explained everything we asked. We welcomed our baby girl and it was a normal delivery. Our experience was so wonderful throughout the pregnancy and delivery due to Dr. Ritu and we are so happy to find her. As our family was away the whole staff and doctor were like a family too us and we are very grateful for that.",

But my initial experience left me with no choice :)This June I delivered my second kid (normal again) under her guidance. Being 40 years old and a high risk pregnancy by default, this was something i only wished for :)My journey was smooth with a beautiful outcome both times.

But the first day i visited Dr Rituparna it was entirely different. She was so sweet enough to understand our situation and suggested the best. We had a baby girl on April 10 normal delivery. I can't thank Dr Rituparna enough for everything. ",

My husband searched for a doctor online and got to know about the doctors' clinic. In the past we did not have good experience with the other doctors so was not very sure about whom to consult. But must say on our first visit to the doctor's clinic we got a very good vibe and the response from Mam was very helpful. It was a pleasant journey throughout my pregnancy. The doctor is always available for any emergency request and also the support staff is really helpful. Dr. Rituparna is a wonderful gynecologist. Empathetic, knowledgeable, patient, reasonable. Really listens to the patient. Can\u2019t recommend highly enough. Thanks for nurturing the baby and me through this pregnancy!",

Words fall short to express how thankful we are for your wonderful guidance throughout the journey of pregnancy with all the complications(Cervical Cerclage). \n\nBecause of her friendly nature, we never hesitated to reach out to her for any queries/clarifications.

She been very informative and made sure we know when and why each tests and scans were conducted. She made sure we were made aware of importance of being active, having a healthy diet and doing proper exercises for a normal and safe delivery. Her words like 'the baby is doing great' or about its movements use to make our day very pleasant ones. Rather than just consultation to know the baby's growth, she prepared us as well towards our steps to parenthood.She is a very pleasant and sensible doctor, we highly recommend her. Thanks alot Doctor\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude4f",

I was 7 months pregnant when I consulted her  in Ritu women's clinic, The way she took ahead over was wonders like i had pregnancy sugar , low hemoglobin and lot of other complications for my baby. She made sure that i was healthy and fit enough to get the baby into the world . Patiently listening and following up with me via phone . Constantly checking on me and baby's health , which put courage in me for further doing tho . She tried her best to get me into normal delivery but due to less progression seen in normal labour she immediately took over c section and I'm blessed with a boy baby which happened a few days back in ovum and thankful to Dr. Rituparna and Ovum hospital HRBR layout for taking care of me and my baby. \n\n",

Even after my baby was born, she advised me on what to do about his jaundice issues, going above and beyond her duty.\nI highly recommend Dr Rituparna and I guarantee that you will definitely have a safe and pleasant birthing experience with her.",

She is a very calm person and has such a positive aura. We went to her for a Pre pregnancy counseling and within 2 months of it, we conceived. During every visit, she made sure that all my doubts were answered. She never prescribes too many medications or doesn't advise unnecessary investigations. Even though her clinic is crowded most of the times, she doesn't rush with her consultations. She spends quality time with each patient. My entire pregnancy journey was very smooth. In this era where c section is extremely common, Ma'am is one person who motivates for a normal delivery and because of her I had a normal delivery.  I and my husband are forever indebted to Ma'am for giving me a beautiful birthing experience for my first pregnancy. I would highly recommend her. ",

She has taken great care of my wife health also she is lovely to speak at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient! She explains do and don'ts on each visit, also listens to our concerns. She takes time with the patient to help them with their health issues. I highly recommend this clinic.",

Every visit to the clinic was so smooth since she patiently listens and addresses our concerns. We felt relaxed during every visit because of her friendly attitude.  From the beginning she encouraged us to go for normal delivery.  She gave advises on exercises to be done and diet to be followed. Towards the end of my pregnancy, my BP was on a higher side. She kept monitoring and asking about my health. Inspite of my BP being high,  she helped us stay calm and was very patient and kept encouraging me in the labor ward. I delivered a healthy baby boy on Feb 18th through Normal delivery.  She also kept visiting and following up with my health post delivery. We're grateful to Dr. Ritu for her support and guidance throughout our pregnancy journey.  ",

She gave enough time to explain all stages of pregnancy and understand my problems in detail. Her fee is much reasonable in comparison of others.

With her guidance and support I had a normal delivery and I'm blessed with a baby girl few days ago. She is not only knowledgeable and experienced but a person with good ethics and morals which is difficult to find these days. She has all the qualities you would want in a Doctor. She even helped us in having the delivery within our budget and I'm forever grateful to her. She's always there for you whenever you need her. I would say just go to her without a second thought.",

Even though after so many complications the trust we had in her pushed me alot. More than me she had confident in me which helped me enjoy my pregnancy and on Jan 2nd I was blessed with cute little angel. It was a normal (veginal delivery) \n\nI have no words to thank her.

She explained everything in detail from the beginning and gave us the freedom to make our choices. She was very pleasant to interact with during every visit. She always gave adequate time during the consultation irrespective of the number of patients waiting. Her explanations were very clear and we felt that she was in control of the situation throughout. She did a thorough preparation for the delivery. Since we were expecting some complications, she also had prepared the hospital to deal with any emergencies. Thankfully by God's grace everything went off smoothly. The recovery was also very good. We are very thankful to her.",

We visited from the very first day and was very happy with the kind of care and attention we get from maam. She explained each and every situation so nicely and in details. She guided us through the whole period. Even when I got low lying placenta and the fluid level was also too much, she helped us have a healthy baby. The whole pregnancy period was made easy with her clear instructions on how to take care of me and baby during pregnancy period. When I got Gestational diabetes in the final days, her guidance helped us find correct way of managing the last few days of pregnancy. In the entire period of pregnancy she also debunked the myths we generally believed about pregnancy and care. I am very much thankful to maam for the entire journey.",

I have to start by saying she is the best doctor I have come across in my entire life and also a wonderful human being. We had a miscarriage before and were very skeptical initially, but the way she explained us on do's and dont's during our pregnancy tenure was excellent. guided us on each and everything until our delivery and was there for us, supporting and patiently replying to every single query. It's because of her words we felt confident every month until delivery. She was very clear about delivering the baby normally and was herself hesitant for C section and made sure we deliver normally by providing accurate details on time all the way. Overall she is a very humble human being and provides ample time to patients and their queries.I would recommend her whole heartedly.",

On the day of the delivery she was extremely professional and did multiple follow ups to ensure the well being of the mother and baby. She was always approachable for any questions, always available on calls during any emergency and treated us like one of her closed ones during the entire period. Under her guidance and blessings we became parents to a baby boy on 8th November, it was a hassle free experience!\n\nIf you are in Bangalore and want to consult a gynaec, just close your eyes and visit her! Her clinic is located at a very convenient place close to Hennur and she is also associated with the best hospitals in the city.",

Also, doctor explains well before she starts treatment, where as most of other doctors do not tell why they are doing certain test or treatment. Pregnancy confirmed within a month and we are blessed with Baby Boy in September'2021. \nI would like to thank doctor and highly recommend this doctor. \nNo words to tell how happy we are.

We had recently shifted to Horamavu, we came across Dr. Ritu's clinic and decided to go and meet the doctor regarding pregnancy. It's the best decision I have taken in life. From the 1st day the doctor clearly explained to us the development of our child, my health, how to cope up with challenges related with pregnancy. She was very supportive and suggested very minimal tablets. All the tests were done on time and with the guidance and help of doctor I delivered a beautiful girl. All thanks to Dr. Rituparna. During delivery she was very motivating she always suggest we get a normal delivery. I had a normal delivery at cloudnine. Thank you so much Dr. Rituparna, words short fall to thank you for your impeccable service and kind words. Love you \u2764\u2764.\n\nRashmi Varun Kumar\n",

The entire experience was delightful with the patience she showcased in answering all my silly questions and doubts. I'd watsapp her at 12am in the night and to my surprise she'd  respond with a smile, calming me down with her expert advice. Never did she talk to me in a hurry whenever i met her during consultations like other doctors mostly do. Her friendliness and patience is admirable. I always felt iam being taken care of, by a friend. My pregnancy was smooth all throughout with jusstt what was needed in terms of prescriptions and tests. Thank you doc, you are the best!! :)",

She is always in the favor of normal delivery and encouraged me as well for the same. She kept suggesting me various exercises time to time for NVD and last week I delivered a lovely baby girl via normal delivery.\nDr. Ritu checked about my health post pregnancy as well. *** ** *** **** ************ *** ***** **** **** ",

Her clinic is equipped with all the relevant instruments for tests and so the front desk lady is also supportive!  Dr. Ritu is a lady of commitment and dedication. Blessed to have a cute healthy baby boy in Ovum, Kalyan Nagar and she was there every moment for the support and guidance. The journey went smooth which seemed to be very tough at first!! Right from the labor upto the time my wife had our baby in her arms she was there. she is just an amazing lady with great in sight of pregnancy and childbirth! I really feel blessed.

She spends a good amount of time in consultation and explains details for any kind of doubt.\n\nWith her amazing treatment, my wife is in last pregnancy trimester now and we are expecting our first baby soon. Dr. Rituperna has been really great in pre-pregnancy treatment and pregnancy consultations.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr Rituperna to any one seeking help\n\n\n",

She is very responsive to all my whatsapp messages. Due to family decision, we had to travel to Kerala for delivery, but we felt regret not having this doctor till my delivery, anyway I am happy that I have found such doctor in Bangalore and hoping to consult the same doctor in future. Anyone from Bangalore who is looking for best doctor for those pregnancy treatments, I would recommend them to meet her. ",

Doctor was always available through call and watsapp. Doctor always gave personal care to every patient.\nPost delivery too doctor helped me in every odd situation when my new born was in NICU. \n\nAll the ladies from my  family are happy with Doctor's treatment with respect to their issues.

I visited ritu mam a year ago for an ectopic pregnancy  which was a emergency if not for her I would have been in a major problem her diagnosis was spot on and she executed it being totally professional ,I went to 3 to 4 docs before her unfortunately no one diagnosed it well.However coming to this year amid these hard times of fighting covid 19 I think she's the only doctor who helped me through my pregnancy which was kind of a risky one as it was a third one and I had many health issues Ritu mam was also with me and always on wats app for any problem any time she is a real example of a responsible doctor as she has a family too but she keeps her patients a priority, thanks to her and her expertise tat I have a beautiful baby and I'm healthy as well thank you ritu mam you are the best ,hope and loads of love to u and your family.Any further problem s also she's my resort .Once again thank you mam",

I have never seen any doctor connecting with their patients so amazingly the way she does. She treats her patients personally and ensure they carry a smile while leaving the clinic every time. She listens all questions very patiently and explain each of them in details. This much care at personal level I doubt any obstetrician does now a days. From my seventh month onward she made sure I am doing enough workouts to have a normal delivery which eventually helped me a lot for an uneventful normal delivery with 3.3 kg baby boy. I would strongly recommend her to anyone & everyone. If you are consulting her be ensured you in safe hands.\nA good human being, very friendly natural, humble personality & obviously a great mother makes her the best. \nKeep going good work Dr.  Wish you all the best.",

Doctor never gave unnecessary tablets and medication.  She always encouraged me to go with home remedies. Most importantly she was available every time either for call or text. Even she came to hospital on midnight when there was critical situation.\n\nHighly recommend Rituparna for pregnancy consultation. ",

In the first check up she made things clear and asked me to do thyroid test, as my levels were little high she prescribed me thyroid medicine and to follow basic healthy lifestyle. Following all these I conceived naturally in 3 months. During my first trimester I had little complications as my placenta was low lying and I had a small hematoma which got cured in a month under Ritu mam's treatment. During my pregnancy journey Ritu mam prescribed very minimum tests and no any unnecessary medications. she always was in connection with me throughout in whatsApp and phone. During my last trimester I has got Colestasis, which is a risk condition that might happen during last trimester. Ritu mam wanted me to track baby's movement and send that everyday to her, starting from week 32 till the day before delivery, also she was tracking my LFT's and Bile acids properly under proper weekly intervals. As my levels were going high during week 36,  baby boy was delivered by Ritu mam undergoing Csec at 30 April'23 . We are very happy with her guidance/treatment and will personally suggest people to consult her if you are looking for any obgyn problems. ",

Result was so good and so quick that by May first week I conceived. \nMe and my husband were shocked..we could not believe that we were going to become parents, as we always thought PCOD treatments takes time.. But Dr.Rituparna proved it wrong.. \nFrom May 5th a new journey started.. Dr.Rituparna guided me to proform all the scans and blood test time to time. Everything went well till 35th week..  In 35th week we went for growth scan.. and the report showed different in growth of the twin babies.. So Dr.Rituparna decided to deliver within 36 weeks to preven compilations. Surgery was done well without any complications.. both the babies were delivered healthy without any complications.. and we got discharged in 3 days.. \nI fall short of words to express how grateful I am to Dr. Rituparna Bera Sarkar for making our dream come true. Thank you so much Dr.Rituparna\ud83d\ude42\n\n",

For the 9 months that I was under her care, I was struck by her personal, individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering my questions, often anticipating them. I was further impressed with her incredible professional responsiveness in terms of communication. She responded to WhatsApp and phone calls within the same day and always contacted me personally every time i needed. These qualities alone would have set her apart from other physicians. Her expertise made me feel reassured, confident and taken care of. \nMedical institutions aren't always so in tune with individual needs. Patients are usually one of many and are treated as such. Dr. Ritu treats each patient as if they are the only one, and it is remarkable that she makes what could potentially be an impersonal institutional context more personal and thoughtful.\"She is truly an exceptional doctor, and I can\u2019t praise her enough.\u00a0 In short, we had a great experience with her.\u00a0",

How do I start my story?I've been come for stomach pain, but found a good therapist for my personal problems. Honestly I don't think any other doctor would be so cool with a patient. 2 yrs passed and I've been for small gynic issues. But here comes my major health issue, I had a tiny paraovarian cyst which was not really a big problem, but doctor really insisted me a lot to take out the cyst. I didn't agree to it at first, but later on my stomach had bad cramps and so many. Finally my surgery was fixed 1 month back, but again to my fate there was something wrong in one of my ovary which was found during the surgery. It was a borderline tumour as told in my biopsy, so I was suggested to remove my right ovary because it might turn cancerous anytime. I had complete trust on the doctor, so I went ahead with another surgery 2 weeks back. Now I'm all good and healthy. So, all in all this is my story and whoever takes a look on my story, you can happily trust Dr.Ritu who is a well trained and experienced, importantly the most friendly one. And I'm super happy to share my story with u all\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42Thank you so much Dr. Ritu, and all ur support so far means a lot to me\ud83d\ude42",

She takes her time to communicate without being in a hurry.\nI\u2019m usually very scared of hospital\u2019s and doctors but she makes you feel very comfortable .She tries her best to do whatever is possible from her end. She\u2019s more of a friend when compared to a doctor. This is the first time I\u2019ve come across such a good doctor in  Bangalore. Post delivery also she made sure to keep checking on me which feels great because at that time we need at most support and care. \nShe has great knowledge in her field and is very passionate about her work. \nI would recommend her 10/10.

I have enjoyed every moment of it because of you.\nAfter six months of the treatment Dr. confirmed the good news about our healthy pregnancy. Like every women, we too became very emotional. I was amazed to see that whatever she told at the beginning of the treatment those exactly turned out to be true.I must say that her detailing is exceptionally good. Every time we visited clinic, we got good feelings. Me and my husband were so excited when she used to explain the detailed scan. Any problem and she was there to solve. My confidence was built by her only for normal delivery. I remember when I said doc normal will be tough, she replied  \"may be but not impossible for you\". And finally she made that happen.  \nThank you very much mam agin. We are going to miss you a lot..",

All the sisters were super supportive during my entire journey. Being a PCOD pts I was trying for pregnancy for more than 3 years. With the friend's recommendation, I met Ritu mam. Like a family member , She explained my condition and treated me like her own sister. I conceived after four months. I trusted her blindly and followed whatever she suggested. My pregnancy went uneventfully and according to her strict advice, I didn't gain more than 11 kg weight to have a normal delivery. All her words came true and I finally delivered normally. Her attachment with patients is something which we miss now a days. I can't thank her enough for what she did for us. Wherever I go, She will be in my heart.  Doctor, God bless you.",

There were some challenges in the journey but with Dr.Ritu, it was very positive and encouraging. She explains every step in the process and the need for medication if any very clearly. She is extremely comitted to each patient/ delivery. As the delivery date approaches she takes personal care and guides through WhatsAppPositives about the clinic :1. Having in-house ultrasound scan is a great advantage - it's hassle free and every decision is well informed2. Recent expansion of space and renovation is really helpful3. Most of the medicines are available in-house4. Very high quality consultation in affordable cost - servers all segments of the society!!",

I truly love the way you guided me over last few months.I started my journey when I was in 2nd trimester after getting good feedback from friend. Over the time I became completely dependant on her for everything.. On the delivery day her presence itself gave me the confidence to bear the labour pain and go through my life time experience of normal delivery though I had a history of previous lscs. I truly convey my gratefulness to her and bless her from the core of my heart. Madam u are an inspiration. ",
