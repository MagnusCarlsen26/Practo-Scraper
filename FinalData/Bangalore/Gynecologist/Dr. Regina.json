Until 4:30 Chaithra did not feel any labour pain and hence Doc moved her OT and delivered a baby boy through C-section. After delivery when Ma\u2019m explained the difficulty that she faced to complete the surgery due to the baby had rounded the chord twice around its neck.(This was never captured in any of the scannings) \nDoc literally had to push so hard (Normally delivering women would do :) :) ) and that could be next to impossible for a normal delivery to happen.\nI\u2019m really Thankful to Dr. Regina for taking the right decision at the right time.\nAfter delivery she had come out calmly and said due to God\u2019s grace we could do it. I actually strongly feel it\u2019s due to Dr. Regina\u2019s grace everything was normal.\nThere are lot of technicalities involved in this process and Trust me Dr. Regina is an amazing technician :) \nJust blindly follow what ever Ma\u2019m says and she will take care of everything which I believe she will take the correct decisions.\nThis was my case but there are other two cases where Ma\u2019m delivered a normal delivery. 1st one was the person who referred us to Dr. Regina and 2nd one(my sister) was whom I referred Dr. Regina to.\n\nI would like to Thank Dr. Regina once again !!! \n",

After struggling with infertility for long 7 years, I got pregnant while on her treatment. Through out the pregnancy and delivery, she has taken care of me like her own sister. Since I had a previous miscarriage, I was extremely nervous this time. She made me so comfortable and relaxed all the time. Whenever I demand for a scan to see baby heart beat, she does it with so much patience and made me relaxed. She is very humble and down to earth. Moreover understand patient's feelings and listen to their issues without any hurry. We can reach her on call anytime if there is any emergency. During all stages of my pregnancy, she has taken care extremely well. Unlike other doctors I have seen, she discuss every aspect of treatment with her patients and respect their opinion also before taking any decision. Also nurse, Kalyani sister is well experienced and has taken care of me extremely well. They both helped me to get my baby safely in my hands.",

Her kindness and concern make everything better and is of great encouragement.The instructions given were clear, the tests done were authentic, and above all, the care provided was exemplary. Her clear communication fosters a trusting patient doctor relationship.

Until 4:30 Chaithra did not feel any labour pain and hence Doc moved her OT and delivered a baby boy through C-section. After delivery when Ma\u2019m explained the difficulty that she faced to complete the surgery due to the baby had rounded the chord twice around its neck.(This was never captured in any of the scannings) \nDoc literally had to push so hard (Normally delivering women would do :) :) ) and that could be next to impossible for a normal delivery to happen.\nI\u2019m really Thankful to Dr. Regina for taking the right decision at the right time.\nAfter delivery she had come out calmly and said due to God\u2019s grace we could do it. I actually strongly feel it\u2019s due to Dr. Regina\u2019s grace everything was normal.\nThere are lot of technicalities involved in this process and Trust me Dr. Regina is an amazing technician :) \nJust blindly follow what ever Ma\u2019m says and she will take care of everything which I believe she will take the correct decisions.\nThis was my case but there are other two cases where Ma\u2019m delivered a normal delivery. 1st one was the person who referred us to Dr. Regina and 2nd one(my sister) was whom I referred Dr. Regina to.\n\nI would like to Thank Dr. Regina once again !!! \n",

After struggling with infertility for long 7 years, I got pregnant while on her treatment. Through out the pregnancy and delivery, she has taken care of me like her own sister. Since I had a previous miscarriage, I was extremely nervous this time. She made me so comfortable and relaxed all the time. Whenever I demand for a scan to see baby heart beat, she does it with so much patience and made me relaxed. She is very humble and down to earth. Moreover understand patient's feelings and listen to their issues without any hurry. We can reach her on call anytime if there is any emergency. During all stages of my pregnancy, she has taken care extremely well. Unlike other doctors I have seen, she discuss every aspect of treatment with her patients and respect their opinion also before taking any decision. Also nurse, Kalyani sister is well experienced and has taken care of me extremely well. They both helped me to get my baby safely in my hands.",

From that moment onward I have never tried to find any other Gynaecologist. As the saying goes, that the first impression is the best impression, it did leave a long lasting impression in me. Dr. Regina was very friendly, polite and an extremely efficient Gynaecologist. After a few check-ups we became more acquainted and started going to her Health Today Clinic which is at OMBR Layout. I have since then given birth to a beautiful and wonderful daughter who is two and half year old. We ensured that we went to Chaya hospital where Dr. Regina was working. Over the years I could say that she is more like a family doctor because we sometime go to her clinic for most of the minor sickness we come across. I strongly recommend Dr. Regina for anyone who is looking to find a friendly and caring doctor. ",

God directed us to Dr. Regina. She immediately understood the severity of my pain and diagnosed it as endometriosis and adviced me to undergo the hysterectomy. Explained about the disease and treatment required and side effects and post operation treatment. I was very scared and anxious. She comforted me and conducted the surgery which was a very complicated one. It was stage 4 endometriosis with bowel adhesion. Another important thing is that I could approach her for any doubts on the treatment over the phone through text or a phone call. She would definitely respond in times when we are unable to go and meet her in the clinic. Very understanding. We as a family would like to thank God for Dr. Regina. May God bless her and use her to help many more.",

I had my baby boy delivered by Dr. she has done my operation so well and neatly, that other Doctors who visited me, also praised her. She has \"God gifted hands\". Who ever is in her care, I guarantee you are safe. Do not hesitate to consult Dr.  Regina.  After I had a bad experience with another Dr. my friend who has great faith in Dr. Regina refferd me to her, it was a true blessing I met Dr. Regina and now my baby boy and me are safe. God Bless You Dr. may you continue to prosper and be a blessing to many more couples. ",

Sister Kalyani presented herself in a positive professional manner. I was encouraged to clarify all my doubts ( even through the phone call). Even though it was difficult for normal delivery, Dr.Regina encouraged me and made it a successful normal delivery. All thanks to the almighty God for showing me a such a wonderful doctor.We wish Dr.Regina and sister Kalyani all the very best and all success in their career. God bless you both abundantly.",

She is a gem of a person who is very friendly and caring. My mother was facing hot flash problem and after visiting her clinic, she gave a hope of things getting better at the earliest and with her medicines gradually my mom was feeling much relief from hot flash, Hot flash is not a normal thing where people suffer throughout the day. Now recently, there was a complications with uterus and we consulted her again and then she recommended us to go for uterus removal due to cyst formation which might lead to cancer. We were in a very panic situation and Dr. Regina gaves us hopes again saying that everything will be normal and it's not the time to panic. Let's not further delay and let's go with Hysterectomy surgery which will save us from cancer. Doctor herself did the surgery and she saved my mother from Cancer. I just feel like being thankful to her throughout my life. Thank you, Thank you, Thanks a ton for everything.",

Why can't it be arranged such that a patient has to wait maximum for 15 minutes. The doctor sounds very rude. I would never ever take my mother there.",

Thanks to her, we caught the same issue early this time, and also was able to find out baby was having some issues, in time. I ended up having my baby a lil early at 34+5 weeks, but everything went well and NICU stay was only 3 days. She was there with us giving medical and emotional support right from start. Also, her clinic is very close to 3 major maternity and newborn hospitals. I would strongly recommend her, especially if you live in/or around the HRBR area in Bangalore. ",
