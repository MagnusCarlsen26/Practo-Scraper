"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy,Cervical Cerclage,Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I would highly recommend Dr Manju Deepthi B. *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* **** * **** **** **** ******* I would like to share my wonderful experience with Dr Manju Deepthi who has been a God in Disguise for me. I had been looking for gynecologist for 1 year and with God's grace, I came across her and I have been consulting her since day 1 of my pregnancy.
I had a very rough pregnancy journey, and I was going to lose my baby when I was 19 weeks pregnant. On 16/11/2023 I was taken to the hospital on emergency, I was 4 cm dilated and was almost going to miscarry. Dr Manju Deepthi took a huge risk of performing emergency cerclage where my cervix was stitched. However, post preforming the initial surgery my stiches had started giving up from one side, however she refused to give up as the membrane was still intact and she performed another surgery and restitched my cervix. I was hospitalized for 3 months and was on complete bed rest and on heavy medications. I was in such a critical state where my stitches could have given up at any point and as I was on complete bed rest my baby was not gaining weight and I used to breakdown every single time when the scanning was done, but Dr Manju Deepthi always consoled me, motivated me and sympathized my situation and did her best to save me and my baby. The entire Cloudine Hospital (HRBR) stayed by my side prayed for me and constantly motivated me.
As the pregnancy continued, due to baby weight, there was a risk that my cervix could tear and could have caused a huge damage hence I had to opt for the delivery. Dr Manju Deepthi tried her best so that I could deliver the baby normally however I was in a very weak condition due to which C-section was performed and I have successfully delivered my baby on 14th February 2024 (33 weeks 4 days) and baby was 1.9 kg. Dr Manju Deepthi also had made sure that the best pediatrician and NICU Team were available at the time of my delivery and I Thank the Pediatricians Dr Sujith, Dr Sandeep and Dr Prashanth for helping my baby survive.
I don't have enough of words to describe how much grateful I am towards Dr Manju Deepthi and her Team, Hema Madam, Dr Supritha Rangaswamy, Dr Ayesha, Dr Nikitha, Dr Sahithi and all the nursing Team (Sister Balema, Deeksha, Sita, Monalisa, Anu, Sheeba and team) because of whom today my baby is doing wonderful. Thank you for all your support and prayers. And huge thank you to the Housekeeping Staff and Canteen Staff who has shown nothing but kindness towards me from day 1 and even post delivering the baby.

I strongly recommend Dr Manju Deepthi to all the women who are looking for not only a best gynecologist but an expert who will not only consult but will walk throughout your pregnancy journey by your side. She is a great listener and very calm person who would give you only honest opinion on the given situation and guide you accordingly and this is the main reason for me to continue consulting her till date.

Thank You Cloudnine Hospital (HRBR) for having such a wonderful doctor onboard.
