   We decided to consult Dr. Deepthi based on online reviews and started with video consulting. We had so many doubts and questions. She answered those so well, provided guidance on how we should approach henceforth. Based on that experience, we decided to consult Dr. Deepthi through this entire journey, though her clinic was very far from our home.
   Dr. Deepthi is very kind, approachable and listens to our problems carefully. Being first pregnancy, we were bit anxious. However, during every visit she helped us understand that everything is normal and there is nothing to worry. 
   We never had to wait at the clinic, doctor was always available at the time of apppoitment. She also gave her personal number and provided guidance on phone whenever we required. She never prescribed unnecessary medicines, tests or scans. She advised to focus on diet and exercises.

She helped us with appointments and any support required during visit. During COVID they took all the necessary precautions, so we were never worried about health safety.
   Luckily for us, Dr. Deepthi started pregnancy scan facility in the clinic and it was truly great experience, we did all our scans post that in First Care Clinic itself. Doctor explained the scan results in details.

   Dr. Deepthi always emphasized on importance of natural delivery. Her assesment of the expected delivery time was so accurate. 
   After getting admitted in the hospital, she regularly visited to check my condition.  There as well, she didn't go for unnecessary medication and kept giving confidence for normal delivery. 
Finally, we were blessed with healthy baby girl through natural delivery. Heartiest thanks to Dr. Deepthi for all her special efforts.

We started consulting Dr. Deepthi ma'am from my PCOD days and the first time we met ma'am, both my husband and me were convinced that she will be our gyno going forward. Ma'am prescribes medicines only if absolutely necessary and encouraged and educated about making lifestyle changes. Her strength is the way she cares and counsels her patients. 

Continued our journey with ma'am in our pregnancy days as well. Believe me I used to look forward to visiting the clinic and talk to ma'am. She has different aura that you cannot miss :) She answered every question we had and always explained the bed course of action clearly. From day one she encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle in order to have a healthy delivery. Ma'am was reachable everytime we needed. During the labour as well, she was my biggest motivator to go for normal delivery and helped in every single way to have a successful normal delivery. She made sure to check on me multiple times even when I was in hospital. Heartfelt gratitude to ma'am and Dr. Deepthi ma'am you will forever be special in my life! :)

I would like to mention one more person who is also an important person in First care clinic. Ms. Niveditha in the front desk, who greets everybody with a smile and is always such a jovial person. We soon became very good friends. Her service is highly appreciated. 

Clinic is very hygienic and well maintained. Also located in prime location. The in-house scanning facility, NST facility is something that helped me greatly and didn't have to move around during pregnancy. 

Both my husband and me have already referred Dr. Deepthi ma'am to all our friends and she is now a family doctor and we will continue to refer her to everybody we know going forward as well.

The entire delivery was extremely well taken care of. My wife was admitted to the hospital for delivery on Dec 31st. Leaving aside the fact that it was New Year's Eve, Dr. Deepthi was there for us at all the important stages. Considering my wife's situation, Dr. Deepthi suggested for normal delivery and took the perfect decisions at every step, which helped in very good labour progression.

It's extremely difficult to find a humane and humble doctor like Dr. Deepthi, who is truly a gem of a person. She always had our best interests in mind. Our entire experience of pregnancy and delivery was all the more special, thanks to Dr. Deepthi.

We wanted to conceive as soon as possible, so we went for IUI, although doctor gave us option to try naturally with ovulation induction.

At the end of third month we went through a scary situation when I started bleeding. It was most difficult time of our life.

I know choosing a doctor / hospital for your pregnancy is so confusing and have to go by many opinions. 
On 4th of September 2020,  I am blessed with my first child, a baby boy and had a NORMAL delivery. Yes ! I know,Normal delivery is not common nowadays.  All thanks to my Dr Deepthi Shashidhar, her commitment and right decision making skills. 
Ever since I was positive in my pregnancy tests, I am consulting in First Care Clinic. Proper diagnosis,  medication and guidance is something you can always expect.
Dr. Deepthi always spend ample time in clearing all queries,  concerns and proper required advices.  No unnecessary medicines, scans or any tests were suggested by her.  Not just during pregnancy, post pregnancy also she have provided complete care till I was recovered.
If you are looking for a doctor with whom you want to talk without any hesitation in clarifying your problems,  need proper care and **** services you CAN rely on First Care Clinic  and Dr. Deepthi.  
Remember, Never judge a book by its cover !!
So, Instead of going directly to any big hospitals by advertisements go to First Care Clinic which can provide value for your money!!
Also, you will get choice to have delivery done either in Apollo Cradle Jayanagar or in Dr. Malathy Manipal hospital, Jayanagar.
Me and my family is completely happy and thankful  with the services we have received. 

Thank God for such a good Doctor🙏",2020-09-23 05:42:37,False,True,Syalini PJ,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,I went to Dr. Deepti ma'm for my pregnancy checkups and delivery by seeing the reviews from Practo and really we had taken good decision. Thanks to Practo for that. Dr. Deepti ma'm is very friendly and used to be very calm during the visit. She used to clear our doubts very neatly. She never gave any unnecessary scans and medications. Anyone can follow her instructions and suggestions blindly without thinking twice. She gave her personal number and said that don't hesitate to call whenever needed. I liked that as many won't give their personal number to patients. And most important I used to be very happy after visiting her for checkups everytime by clearing all my doubts and by listening to her advices. I really appreciate her for her patience. Even after attending so many patients she always used to be very cool and calm and always smiling which made me feel comfortable. Initially my family members told search for other doctor nearby as the clinic was little far from my home and in my area many hospitals and clinics are there. But as we were very much satisfied with her treatment we never felt to change. By 2nd month I had faced some pregnancy issue and she gave a proper medication on the right time and resolved very soon. For me she tried alot for normal delivery. But due to some issue we had to go for c-section. she had waited from 3pm to 10.30pm and then she explained the situation and the issue with my husband and family very clearly and asked for their opinion. Finally I delivered a healthy baby girl on 26th Jan 2020 by 10.56pm🤗. Myself my husband and all my family members are very happy with her treatment. We all want to thank Deepti ma'm. I strongly recommend Deepti ma'm for pregnancy checkups or any pregnancy related issues. Thank you so much ma'm for making me enjoy my pregnancy period.

I would recommend her to everyone who is like me, like if it’s your 1st pregnancy, or if you are one of those overly curious souls because she is the only one who can understand your mental state and suggest you the right things to do.

The decision to consult her regarding early pregnancy symptoms was made by my wife and I in January 2022. Like most expectant parents, we were clueless and hadn't have that parental instinct then. When multiple fibroids and early bleeding were discovered in her initial scan, panic arose. Despite of our fears, she kept her cool and gave us confidence. With each visit to her clinic, our happiness and sense of confidence grew. She is constantly available and very friendly. Even in the middle of the night, the doctor was on the other end of the phone to allay our fears.

During the fifth month of the pregnancy my wife had to relocate to a rural part of Karnataka since her job demanded it. Dr Deepthi motivated us to take the opportunity and even in the far-off village, her online consultation service gave us the confidence to carry on.


Finally, on October 14, 2022, our baby was born into the hands of Dr. Deepthi at Apollo Cradle and I witnessed it along side of my wife and we felt ineffable joy at the sight of our daughter's first cry.

Last week of October we are Blessed with a Baby Girl (Our first child) at Manipal Hospital, under Deepthi Mam's Supervision, Normal Delivery!

As we don't have any prior Gynaecologist experience whatsoever! Thanks to Deepthi Mam, we are blessed to have her. We got endless MENTAL SUPPORT, she is very PATIENT in LISTENING AND gives you the BEST DIAGNOSIS, MEDICATION, and best LABOUR ROOM EXPERIENCE.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I thank my friend profusely for helping me make the right choice of Gynaecologist and Clinic (First Care Clinic), for my wife's pregnancy. Given that both of us are not in the early child bearing age group, we had our own apprehensions of treading the bold step taken, more so because of the long gap from the first pregnancy. 
The counselling by Dr.Deepthi was very convincing and helped us make informed decisions at every stage in the pregnancy. The doctor's expertise in handling high risk cases was very much evident from her methodical approach, in thoroughly understanding the patient's history, and thereby devise the treatment as is deemed necessary. She was very approachable and explained all the doubts that we had in mind, given our earlier experiences from first pregnancy. 
Infact the doctor used to proactively follow up and get periodical observations/test results, to avoid any delay in treatment. There were instances where the doctor took the initiative herself in getting appointments from renowned radiologist to make quick and informed decisions. 
The doctor visited us often from the time my wife got admitted in hospital and was around during labour as well, assuring us that the right care was being provided to her at all times. Even though my wife underwent a high risk pregnancy, the doctor vouched for normal delivery, without coaxing us for other options, and tried whatever was best and appropriate for that moment.
My heartfelt gratitude to Dr.Deepthi and thank her profusely for guiding us all through the journey of becoming parents once again. 
Need to make a mention of First Care Clinic as well, which is well maintained and has in-house scanning and lab test facility. There is no need to travel different places in order to take ultrasound/lab tests. The front desk staffs are equally commendable for the service provided thus making the memories last a life time. 
Going further, I will definitely recommend Dr.Deepthi RK Shashidhar to whomever we know and are seeking for guidance. ",2023-03-11 18:24:39,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

When we met her first, she told us all the required information like what stage pregnancy is in, precautions to be taken and foods to eat n avoid to carry it further and avoid miscarriage in first trimester.

From then there is no looking back. We decided to continue with her as we felt the trust and faith in her.

Throughout the pregnancy, she guided us and took right decission at right time, such as making sure to get hemoglobin shots when it was low and keep guiding about weight gain and tips to have normal delivery.
She never prescribed unnecessary medications and nrver forced us about any unnecessary tests if something can be achieved through diet changes.

During my delivery, she gave me confidence to try for vaginal delivery even guided duty doctors through phone constantly to go for less riskier and medicated route since i was induced. I opted for c sec after 15hrs of labour when it dint progress and was in hospital for 7 days due to baby having jaundice, she was constantly in touch with me and duty nurses and doc and visited me everyday.

She was just a call away. Even after delivery when I use to ping her in WhatsApp for some queries she has helped without thinking i am not her client or patient anymore.

Choosing her is the best decission we made.
First care clinic is also handled nicely. Have to mention Nivedita who promptly handles all appointments, we never waited more than 15 min for 9 months. Even the radiologist does the scan with utmost patience, checks thoroughly and answers all our queries during scan. 
Overall first care clinic and Dr.Deepti made us feel at home and confidant throughout the pregnancy which i am truly grateful to. I have referred them to my friends and families and i am definitely going for second pregnancy to her.",2022-11-07 13:20:09,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

She was admitted for 8 days for theCOVID treatment.I must mention here Dr. Deepthi was so generous and approachable, though my wife was admitted in different hospital under different doctor, for each and every medicine what was given to my wife for COVID treatment I used  to ping her personal number to check if those medicines are safe for maternity or not and every time I got a reply. sometimes I felt guilty to get the medical assistance without consultation charges but she never ever thought beyond her patient and her treatment. Sorry mam for disturbing you a lot. Once my wife became negative we continued the journey with Dr. Deepthi. In our case there was an issue of premature placenta. At 36 week placenta was 8.3cm, still doctor never asked for C-section.  Till the end she tried for normal delivery. But at mid of 37th week again we faced some complications regarding baby movements. I just went for check up to her and she asked us to get admitted. I am really thankful about her right decision at right moment and we are blessed with a healthy baby boy and well doing mommy.
