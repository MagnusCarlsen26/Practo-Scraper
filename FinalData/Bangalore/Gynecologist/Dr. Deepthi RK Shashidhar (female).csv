She answered those so well, provided guidance on how we should approach henceforth. Based on that experience, we decided to consult Dr. Deepthi through this entire journey, though her clinic was very far from our home.

We started consulting Dr. Deepthi ma'am from my PCOD days and the first time we met ma'am, both my husband and me were convinced that she will be our gyno going forward. Ma'am prescribes medicines only if absolutely necessary and encouraged and educated about making lifestyle changes. Her strength is the way she cares and counsels her patients. 

Continued our journey with ma'am in our pregnancy days as well. Believe me I used to look forward to visiting the clinic and talk to ma'am. She has different aura that you cannot miss :) She answered every question we had and always explained the bed course of action clearly. From day one she encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle in order to have a healthy delivery. Ma'am was reachable everytime we needed. During the labour as well, she was my biggest motivator to go for normal delivery and helped in every single way to have a successful normal delivery. She made sure to check on me multiple times even when I was in hospital. Heartfelt gratitude to ma'am and Dr. Deepthi ma'am you will forever be special in my life! :)

I would like to mention one more person who is also an important person in First care clinic. Ms. Niveditha in the front desk, who greets everybody with a smile and is always such a jovial person. We soon became very good friends. Her service is highly appreciated. 

Clinic is very hygienic and well maintained. Also located in prime location. The in-house scanning facility, NST facility is something that helped me greatly and didn't have to move around during pregnancy. 

Both my husband and me have already referred Dr. Deepthi ma'am to all our friends and she is now a family doctor and we will continue to refer her to everybody we know going forward as well.

Leaving aside the fact that it was New Year's Eve, Dr. Deepthi was there for us at all the important stages. Considering my wife's situation, Dr. Deepthi suggested for normal delivery and took the perfect decisions at every step, which helped in very good labour progression.

"Value for money,Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,Gynaecological Problem,Pregnant Women Counseling,",0,0,YES,"Almost a year back, me and my wife started the process of planning a child to start our family (after 5 years of our marriage ,that is). We consulted couple of doctors only to become the victims of rudeness,unsolicited discussions and especially ""the so called very senior doctors"" unable to understand or listen to the new age problems related to work, stress. 

We are happy to share now ,that , we are proud parents of a little baby girl , who is our angel ,changing our worlds with positivism and being an inspiration for our family. 

It would not have been possible without the doctor's utmost dedication ,due diligence and professional attitude in the complete process, given our circumstances and situation. During the initial consultation after visiting other doctors, we got the same / similar answers, but, the way Dr.Deepthi Shashidhar interacted and presented the options to us.It couldn't have been any better ,which helped in building the trust and faith to continue future consultations.

This doctor has the best combination of giving options where it doesn't need emphasis, And, taking leadership where it matters. (Ex: For routine blood tests/reports , we went ahead with a pathology lab near to our house - she was supportive as compared to other doctors, with whom, we have had experiences of their own lab recommendation.

And, When it was a specific/complex test involved, she insisted on a clinic which was non-negotiable and the best.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy with PCOD,",0,0,YES,"I had very high PCOD due to which I was not able to conceive. We initially consulted few other doctors as well but they created a panic situation for us. Then we visited to Dr. Deepthi which was altogether different experience. She is very calm and handles every situation in a composed manner. She explains everything in detail. She prescribed few medicines initially and asked us to try naturally. We tried for few months but when I did not conceived, we went for ovulation induction. She gave us option to either try naturally or opt for IUI, in addition to ovulation induction. Good thing about Dr. Deepthi is that she does not imposes anything. She explains all the options in detail and suggests the better option but does not impose anything. We wanted to conceive as soon as possible, so we went for IUI, although doctor gave us option to try naturally with ovulation induction. With ovulation induction and IUI we conceived on very first month. As it was our first pregnancy we had hundreds of questions which doctor answered everytime with utmost patience and details. At the end of third month we went through a scary situation when I started bleeding. It was most difficult time of our life. There was risk of losing the pregnancy but the way doctor handled the whole situation we can never forget that. Coming to present I delivered a healthy baby that also through normal delivery, thanks to the doctor. She tries for normal delivery till the very end unless there are complications. Doctor had given her personal number and is very approachable. The most we liked about the doctor is her friendly nature, her calmness in difficult situations and the details in which she explains things. ",2021-12-16 15:54:38,False,True,Neha Kumari,,,

Before I share my feedback on First Care Clinic and Dr.  Deepthi Shashidhar, let me tell you all this is not a paid review. 

I know choosing a doctor / hospital for your pregnancy is so confusing and have to go by many opinions. 
On 4th of September 2020,  I am blessed with my first child, a baby boy and had a NORMAL delivery. Yes ! I know,Normal delivery is not common nowadays.  All thanks to my Dr Deepthi Shashidhar, her commitment and right decision making skills. 
Ever since I was positive in my pregnancy tests, I am consulting in First Care Clinic. Proper diagnosis,  medication and guidance is something you can always expect.
Dr. Deepthi always spend ample time in clearing all queries,  concerns and proper required advices.  No unnecessary medicines, scans or any tests were suggested by her.  Not just during pregnancy, post pregnancy also she have provided complete care till I was recovered.
If you are looking for a doctor with whom you want to talk without any hesitation in clarifying your problems,  need proper care and **** services you CAN rely on First Care Clinic  and Dr. Deepthi.  
Remember, Never judge a book by its cover !!
So, Instead of going directly to any big hospitals by advertisements go to First Care Clinic which can provide value for your money!!
Also, you will get choice to have delivery done either in Apollo Cradle Jayanagar or in Dr. Malathy Manipal hospital, Jayanagar.
Me and my family is completely happy and thankful  with the services we have received.

Thanks to Practo for that. Dr. Deepti ma'm is very friendly and used to be very calm during the visit. She used to clear our doubts very neatly. She never gave any unnecessary scans and medications. Anyone can follow her instructions and suggestions blindly without thinking twice. She gave her personal number and said that don't hesitate to call whenever needed. I liked that as many won't give their personal number to patients. And most important I used to be very happy after visiting her for checkups everytime by clearing all my doubts and by listening to her advices. I really appreciate her for her patience. Even after attending so many patients she always used to be very cool and calm and always smiling which made me feel comfortable. Initially my family members told search for other doctor nearby as the clinic was little far from my home and in my area many hospitals and clinics are there. But as we were very much satisfied with her treatment we never felt to change. By 2nd month I had faced some pregnancy issue and she gave a proper medication on the right time and resolved very soon. For me she tried alot for normal delivery. But due to some issue we had to go for c-section. she had waited from 3pm to 10.30pm and then she explained the situation and the issue with my husband and family very clearly and asked for their opinion. Finally I delivered a healthy baby girl on 26th Jan 2020 by 10.56pm🤗. Myself my husband and all my family members are very happy with her treatment. We all want to thank Deepti ma'm. I strongly recommend Deepti ma'm for pregnancy checkups or any pregnancy related issues. Thank you so much ma'm for making me enjoy my pregnancy period.

The decision to consult her regarding early pregnancy symptoms was made by my wife and I in January 2022. Like most expectant parents, we were clueless and hadn't have that parental instinct then. When multiple fibroids and early bleeding were discovered in her initial scan, panic arose. Despite of our fears, she kept her cool and gave us confidence. With each visit to her clinic, our happiness and sense of confidence grew. She is constantly available and very friendly. Even in the middle of the night, the doctor was on the other end of the phone to allay our fears.

During the fifth month of the pregnancy my wife had to relocate to a rural part of Karnataka since her job demanded it. Dr Deepthi motivated us to take the opportunity and even in the far-off village, her online consultation service gave us the confidence to carry on.


Finally, on October 14, 2022, our baby was born into the hands of Dr. Deepthi at Apollo Cradle and I witnessed it along side of my wife and we felt ineffable joy at the sight of our daughter's first cry.

After lot of browsing I came across Dr Deepthi via Practo. The feedback was very promising.Over the period of last 8 months when I have known her I found all the comments mentioned in the feedback section to be correct. There were minimal tests performed, minimal medicine prescribed (mostly harmless like pro biotics etc), no fuss created over any abnormalities in the test results (my wife was Rh -ve and her Hb went pretty low) and the doctor was available 27x7 on phone.For the tests she was never adamant on a specific lab as I always got those done from several, for blood she asked me if I want to arrange the donor or would like her help etc. There were lot many such instances.Another example which shows the level of professionalism of Dr Deepthi is I bought a package from Apollo Cradle for by childs birth.

The entire process till delivery was carried under the consultation of Deepthi madam. I am very happy about the way i was guided and hence, writing this review.

 Health issue- I had a bad experience with my 1st pregnancy. I was 10 weeks pregnant when I had to abort my child because of no growth. It was a Sunday morning & all of a sudden, I started bleeding. I tried to reach my doctor (Dr X whom I was consulting during that time). But the Dr. was not available on Sunday. My condition was getting bad. It was then my hubby googled out for the available Dr on Sunday & fortunately we found Deepthi Mam who guided & helped us in the entire missed abortion process. She was there with us till late until we were in a comfortable position. Though it was a bad day which we don't want to remember, however we would like to thank Dr Deepthi for the much needed support.

From then onwards, I continued to consult Dr Deepthi. She prescribed only basic medicines & exercises and it is under her supervision that we are blessed with our little Princess. Dr. Deepthi made the entire pregnancy process very smooth. During our each visit, she used to listen to our doubts patiently and clarify them with all smiles on her face.  She never prescribed unnecessary medications and tests. She was very supportive, humble and was available 24*7.

Given that both of us are not in the early child bearing age group, we had our own apprehensions of treading the bold step taken, more so because of the long gap from the first pregnancy. 
The counselling by Dr.Deepthi was very convincing and helped us make informed decisions at every stage in the pregnancy. The doctor's expertise in handling high risk cases was very much evident from her methodical approach, in thoroughly understanding the patient's history, and thereby devise the treatment as is deemed necessary. She was very approachable and explained all the doubts that we had in mind, given our earlier experiences from first pregnancy. 
Infact the doctor used to proactively follow up and get periodical observations/test results, to avoid any delay in treatment. There were instances where the doctor took the initiative herself in getting appointments from renowned radiologist to make quick and informed decisions. 
The doctor visited us often from the time my wife got admitted in hospital and was around during labour as well, assuring us that the right care was being provided to her at all times. Even though my wife underwent a high risk pregnancy, the doctor vouched for normal delivery, without coaxing us for other options, and tried whatever was best and appropriate for that moment.
My heartfelt gratitude to Dr.Deepthi and thank her profusely for guiding us all through the journey of becoming parents once again. 
Need to make a mention of First Care Clinic as well, which is well maintained and has in-house scanning and lab test facility. There is no need to travel different places in order to take ultrasound/lab tests. The front desk staffs are equally commendable for the service provided thus making the memories last a life time.

When we met her first, she told us all the required information like what stage pregnancy is in, precautions to be taken and foods to eat n avoid to carry it further and avoid miscarriage in first trimester.

From then there is no looking back. We decided to continue with her as we felt the trust and faith in her.

Throughout the pregnancy, she guided us and took right decission at right time, such as making sure to get hemoglobin shots when it was low and keep guiding about weight gain and tips to have normal delivery.
She never prescribed unnecessary medications and nrver forced us about any unnecessary tests if something can be achieved through diet changes.

During my delivery, she gave me confidence to try for vaginal delivery even guided duty doctors through phone constantly to go for less riskier and medicated route since i was induced. I opted for c sec after 15hrs of labour when it dint progress and was in hospital for 7 days due to baby having jaundice, she was constantly in touch with me and duty nurses and doc and visited me everyday.

She was just a call away. Even after delivery when I use to ping her in WhatsApp for some queries she has helped without thinking i am not her client or patient anymore.

Choosing her is the best decission we made.
First care clinic is also handled nicely. Have to mention Nivedita who promptly handles all appointments, we never waited more than 15 min for 9 months. Even the radiologist does the scan with utmost patience, checks thoroughly and answers all our queries during scan.

I just went for check up to her and she asked us to get admitted. I am really thankful about her right decision at right moment and we are blessed with a healthy baby boy and well doing mommy.
