We consulted mam in 9th Month only. I had many doubts before going to hospital but once I met her everything is cleared. I was looking for a doctor who would help me get a normal delivery & Dr Rashmi is the right one. She listened and gave advice even during the delivery time & tried to do normal delivery till last minute.\nOne of the qualities that truly sets Dr Rashmi Patil mam apart is her ability to make her patients feel comfortable & ease. She takes time to listen attentively to any concerns or questions asked & provides clear & concise explanations. She explains situation and respects your opinion. She doesn\u2019t corner you to make tough decisions without providing proper information.\nI whole heartedly recommend her to anyone seeking exceptional gynaecological care. We are forever grateful for her.\nFacilities at Motherhood hospital were top notch. They focus mainly on personalized care. Staff are very cooperative; rooms are clean & comfortable. Overall Motherhood Hospital offers Quality care & support for families during precious moments of childbirth. I am glad that I chooses right hospital & best doctor.\n",

From the moment we started our journey with her, it was evident that we had found a true gem in the field of healthcare.\n\nDr. Rashmi Patil, has consistently demonstrated her unwavering patience in addressing all our concerns and even our silliest doubts. She goes above and beyond to ensure that we feel heard and well-informed during every visit. Her availability during emergencies has been a source of tremendous reassurance for our family.\n\nMost of the doctors will not spend enough time with you. They just want to finish and move on to the next patient. This one is totally different. She will not rush her treatment or analysis and will always give enough time for her patients.\n\nDuring my wife's second pregnancy, Dr. Rashmi played a pivotal role in ensuring a smooth and healthy journey. Her remarkable experience allowed her to handle complications during the delivery with ease, putting our minds at ease during a potentially stressful time.\n\nWhat truly sets her apart is her ability to provide both medical expertise and emotional support. She walked us through the entire process, offering guidance and comfort whenever required. Her exceptional memory meant that we never had to repeat anything we had discussed, even from six months prior. It's evident that she genuinely cares about her patients' well-being and invests in their care on a personal level.\n\nThanks to Dr. Rashmi, our baby and my wife are not only healthy but thriving. We consider ourselves incredibly fortunate to have found such an outstanding doctor who has made this journey a positive and memorable one. She is a true gem of a person, and we feel truly blessed to have her as our trusted healthcare provider.\n",

We consulted mam in 9th Month only. I had many doubts before going to hospital but once I met her everything is cleared. I was looking for a doctor who would help me get a normal delivery & Dr Rashmi is the right one. She listened and gave advice even during the delivery time & tried to do normal delivery till last minute.\nOne of the qualities that truly sets Dr Rashmi Patil mam apart is her ability to make her patients feel comfortable & ease. She takes time to listen attentively to any concerns or questions asked & provides clear & concise explanations. She explains situation and respects your opinion. She doesn\u2019t corner you to make tough decisions without providing proper information.\nI whole heartedly recommend her to anyone seeking exceptional gynaecological care. We are forever grateful for her.\nFacilities at Motherhood hospital were top notch. They focus mainly on personalized care. Staff are very cooperative; rooms are clean & comfortable. Overall Motherhood Hospital offers Quality care & support for families during precious moments of childbirth. I am glad that I chooses right hospital & best doctor.\n",

From the moment we started our journey with her, it was evident that we had found a true gem in the field of healthcare.\n\nDr. Rashmi Patil, has consistently demonstrated her unwavering patience in addressing all our concerns and even our silliest doubts. She goes above and beyond to ensure that we feel heard and well-informed during every visit. Her availability during emergencies has been a source of tremendous reassurance for our family.\n\nMost of the doctors will not spend enough time with you. They just want to finish and move on to the next patient. This one is totally different. She will not rush her treatment or analysis and will always give enough time for her patients.\n\nDuring my wife's second pregnancy, Dr. Rashmi played a pivotal role in ensuring a smooth and healthy journey. Her remarkable experience allowed her to handle complications during the delivery with ease, putting our minds at ease during a potentially stressful time.\n\nWhat truly sets her apart is her ability to provide both medical expertise and emotional support. She walked us through the entire process, offering guidance and comfort whenever required. Her exceptional memory meant that we never had to repeat anything we had discussed, even from six months prior. It's evident that she genuinely cares about her patients' well-being and invests in their care on a personal level.\n\nThanks to Dr. Rashmi, our baby and my wife are not only healthy but thriving. We consider ourselves incredibly fortunate to have found such an outstanding doctor who has made this journey a positive and memorable one. She is a true gem of a person, and we feel truly blessed to have her as our trusted healthcare provider.\n",

Her support definately calmed me down during my labour. After my delivery, she had given attention to all the details which are to be taken care and explained me well.\n\nI Really appreciate and be thankful to Dr.Rashmi for her availablity to her patients, be it day or night, she always responded us when ever help needed, be it a phone call or a message.\n\nThank you so much Dr.Rashmi \ud83d\ude0a",

There was no fear of any sort after my first conversation with her, i knew i was in the best hands.  Dr. Rashmi is incredible and highly knowledgeable, more than anything extremely sensitive.  I was made to feel at ease and felt confident in recieving expert medical advice.  She is extremely understanding and listens to your concerns. Her demeanor really put me at ease.  I underwent a hysterectomy and she did it so perfectly and was there to support me even after the surgery and continued guiding me even after my discharge.  She holds a lot of human values which is a rare quality these days in the above practice these days. Ever since my experience i have recommended her to a lot of my relatives and friends and they all have the same opinion as mine, saying that DR. Rashmi Patil is a fine doctor.  *** ** *** **** ******* * **** ****  Thank you so much Dr. Rashmi for all your support and also your patience.",

From then on the entire experience with Dr Rashmi has been nothing short of amazing. She was extremely professional in explaining what the problem was and what the options available were. No procedure was forced on us. The entire decision making was left to us and the pro's and con's of all the options were clearly explained. She never forced us to make decisions in a hurry and gave us the time we needed to make them. She was the brightest spot during the entire hospital stay that my mother-in-law had to go through. Even the post surgery interaction during check-ups was really good and extremely satisfying. The u.s.p of Dr Rashmi definitely has to be the extreme levels of patience in explaining things no matter how many times it is asked and also the fact that she has no superiority heir about her because she is a doctor. She is an extremely humble person and a wonderful person to interact with for any medical advice. Kudos to her.",

Dr Rashmi Patil is a very meticulous person and gives great attention to the details. She is very knowledgeable and explains and advices with lot of clarity and patience. She is thorough with her examinations, communicates very effectively and ensures that at the end of the visit we have understood everything. She held my hand through these ten months and put all my anxieties to rest. She was available whenever I needed her and gave me lot of confidence and emotional support. Even during my hospital stay, the doctor ensured that she provided me with the best care and support. I highly recommend Dr Rashmi Patil!!!!",

She is the most gentle obgyn one might find (her TV scans are never hurtful). She cares for her patients so well and so kindly. Her approach to treatment methods are very assuring. I felt that she is very up-to-date in her field. She's approachable any time for advice and help. I could ask any question related to pregnancy without feeling being judged. I had a difficult labor but with Dr. Rashmi's presence and care, I didn't worry even for a moment for wellbeing of me and my baby. I'm forever grateful to her for her care and guidance through this journey. ******* ****** ***** *** ** *** *****  ",

Being my 1st pregnancy, she guided me at every step. Her friendly character helped me and my family members to approach without any hesitation and clearing all the doubts whenever needed. Overall, I would like to say that my whole 9 month journey was like an easy go without any hassle. I enjoyed my pregnancy time with her presence and would like to recommend her for all to visit and have a happy life. Thank you once again Doctor.",

But she assured us that she only do the surgery and she did it. After 3 weeks of our delivery, she also delivered a kid. It's not ending here.. post delivery, my wife suffered with PDP and she guided us towards appropriate treatment. She personally called my wife to counselling and ask her status on PDP. It reflects how caring she is. Througout our consultation, she never realized us that she is a doctor , she always treat like a friend. We are really thankful of God that we ever met a living god. We have no much words to explain her gratitude.. \n\nWe wish god give her more strength to help more and more people and all success in her career !!!",

Gives the needed time to patiently respond to the our queries - especially for us as we were going through this journey for the first time. This made us very reassured, peaceful post every consulation with her.\nMy wife felt very comfortable with Dr.Rashmi to the extent that we never minded travelling to other part of the Bangalore just to have consulation with Dr.Rashmi. She has been great support to us throughout the journey and even post her delivery (over phone). \nOur kid is now a happy healthy 1.5yr old. We both are extremely grateful to Dr.Rashmi.\n",

She is very quick in finding out the problem, diligent with lots of patience,  sweet natured and friendly unlike other Gynaecologists I had consulted before. Previously few Gynaecologists had wrongly  diagnosed that I suffered from PCOD which i dont have. I only had harmonal imbalances which she diagnosed correctly. Although I consulted her online she was very quick in responding whenever required and also sharing the required information like prescription and what needs to be done next  etc very quickly without keeping me wait for too long. I strongly recommend her :) ",
