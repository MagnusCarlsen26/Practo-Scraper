The accessibility she provides through calls and messages with prompt replies has made the entire experience more reassuring.\n\nDuring labor, I found myself nervous and unable to endure the pain, prompting me to beg for a c-section. However, she reassured me, emphasizing the positive progress and encouraging a normal delivery. In the labor room, her motivational presence was akin to a goddess, providing the strength I needed. True to her words, I successfully delivered a healthy and active baby boy that evening. I am immensely grateful to my doctor and wholeheartedly recommend her.",

She was amazingly supportive and helpful to respond and guide us in the last 9 months. This Jan we were blessed with a healthy baby girl and we are very happy and thankful to her for her guidance throughout this journey. I would rate 5/5 and definitely recommend others to visit mam for any pregnancy related consultation and delivery. Thanks to mam once again.",

Her calm personality and  support have been invaluable during this period. She always prefer normal delivery but remains open to suggesting a c-section in case of complications. The accessibility she provides through calls and messages with prompt replies has made the entire experience more reassuring.\n\nDuring labor, I found myself nervous and unable to endure the pain, prompting me to beg for a c-section. However, she reassured me, emphasizing the positive progress and encouraging a normal delivery. In the labor room, her motivational presence was akin to a goddess, providing the strength I needed. True to her words, I successfully delivered a healthy and active baby boy that evening. I am immensely grateful to my doctor and wholeheartedly recommend her.",
