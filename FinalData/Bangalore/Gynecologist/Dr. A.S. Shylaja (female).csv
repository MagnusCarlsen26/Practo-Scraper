"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"We had a wonderful and meaningful experience with Dr.Shylaja. Highly recommended for genuine treatment. Doctor is a true professional in her approach and have a very calm and intelligent way of handling all the situation to give best output. My end to end journey of pregnancy and delivery was very soothing both medically and mentally which I was very much vouching for. I have been lucky to be treated by Dr. Shylaja. 

Dr.Shylaja is such a great doctor, so humble always available to support. She never minds to respond to my silly queries and doubts. I am thankful to get doctor Shylaja for taking care of me throughout my pregnancy period and delivering our Precious baby boy during. Not only was the consultation and guidance was cordial but doctor was relaxing and guiding me every single moment in operation theatre.Delivery process was smooth and it was very nice experience under her guidance and support.

I would recommend all my friends and other to be mommies to visit Dr. Shylaja. We are thankful to Ma'am for all her support, patience and care.
