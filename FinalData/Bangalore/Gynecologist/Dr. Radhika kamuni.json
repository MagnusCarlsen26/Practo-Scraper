Gives ample time to the patient and explains the issues and even the medications clearly. Whenever I met her it never felt like meeting a Doc but your own sister, she has that motherly compassion which you rarely find in Doctors esp in this era of professionalism. I felt very safe under her guidance and treatment. \nWhen I returned from Dehradun during my second month, I was on heavy medications which Doc Radhika asked me to stop because there was no such complication, she explained and it really helped me mentally as well physically as I was highly nauseated at that time. \n*** ***** ***** *********** *********** *** ***** ********** *********** ***** **** I experienced in my previous pregnancy. This time it was much smoother and happier experience. \nDuring my 5th month we had to shift almost 20 kms from the Doc\u2019s location\u2026 but we were most certain that we wanted to continue with Doc Radhika\u2019s guidance and managed it well. \nI just Love her and have immense respect for her.\u2764\ufe0f \nWe are now blessed with a beautiful angel and its been only a week. I feel healthy and active. \nI was so overwhelmed by the experience that I wanted to write the review to thank Doc Radhika and also to guide many of you, who are looking for compassionate and experienced doctor. \nThankyou so much Doc Radhika \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\nI Love U \u2764\ufe0f\u2026 Stay Happy and Blessed!",

I am really very impressed with how she explains each and every process and reports.  \nIn my whole pregnancy she kept me guiding for each and everything not just the medicines but with the diet too, she always encourages for the home remedies rather than medicine. \nWith her motherly care and support we got the best gift of our life our darling daughter. I had almost given up and was asking for C-section but she consoled me like a mom and I had a normal delivery.\n I recommend Dr Radhika to everyone who is looking for a smooth pregnancy journey and normal delivery.\nThank you Dr Radhika for everything and we will always be grateful to you!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n",

Under her guidance, prompt responses (over phone as well) & treatment now we are blessed with a healthy baby. She listens to the problems very patiently & accordingly prescribes treatment.\n\nShe does not encourage unnecessary tests, medicines for usage of money from patients & supports us to try naturally as there were no profound reasons found for our  last stillbirth case. My wife got pregnant after ~7 months of consultation. In the 3rd trimester, complications started & we again started panicking but She handled the problem very efficiently & with utmost care. By her treatment, we ultimately crossed all the hurdles . The support staff in her clinic ( SARV ADVANCED MULTISPECIALITY CLINIC AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTRE )  are very friendly .\n\n*** ** * ****** *** ** *** We panicked with Fatal stress at 3AM in the morning but she immediately rushed to Hospital (Cloudnine Old Airport Road)  and reached us within minutes.  Her magical treatment gave us a new life. W/O Her we would not have seen this day. We don't have words to say thanks to Her. We pray to GOD that she gets more strength, courage & blessings from the Almighty so that she can bring more & more happiness in the life of Couples. I strongly recommend Dr. Radhika Kamuni to the ones who are looking for good consultation and guidance in Bangalore.",

I delivered a healthy baby boy on 10th July under her guidance and supervision.\n\n*** *** ***** *********** *********** ***** * **********\nEvery time we used to go for a consultation and we used to get positive vibes and comfort that everything is fine.\nHer instructions were very clear and well planned.\n\nThe doctor never hides anything and always gives a clear picture of the medical condition and treatment path she is going to follow.\nI didn't find her anytime giving false hopes. She explains well that for your situation this is the path we have to take and motivated us.\n\nI was tested COVID Positive at 29weeks, I and my husband were worried about the baby, but Dr. Radhika Kamuni positive vibes made us strong.\nMy husband was at home taking care of my elder kid, every day she was updating my condition to him.\n\nEven though in night times, she is still available for help and always answers our queries through the phone which I really appreciate.\nThere are many such good qualities which you want to see in your doctor.\n\nThere is no doubt why this doctor has so many recommendations.\n\nThanks for all that you have done and keep doing the same great work! I wish you get more and more success & happiness.\nGod always keeps you safe and healthy as you are the hope for many women like me.\nThank you so much \n",

Right?. Nowadays, education cannot guarantee, basic manners in a person. Just because you have paid a consultation doesn't mean you should not follow rules, maintain decorum in a clinic. Such people think creating a ruckus and showing disrespect towards a doctor makes them superior??, no ..it shows lack of empathy towards people. Patient came for a non emergency issue, even after seeing doctor being very busy and seeing emergency patients they started creating a ruckus at the reception. When offered a refund( yes patient is lying, was offered a complete refund, but refused saying would like to meet the concerned authority) when informed that -then have to meet doctor herself.Now patient waited till her turn( now waiting was not a conern) just to humiliate, disrespect the doctor. After her turn she very well took good 30 mins for a non emergency concern.( now baby being hungry etc are immaterial to them) When asked politely what was the issue, why were u creating a ruckus outside?..unable to give a logical explanation, started abusing, backanswering , hawling. It's easy to defame a DOCTOR,isn't it? . Just one lame, false review cannot change the truth. I can guarantee many of my patient can give testimony about my behavior ( don't require ur false tag). Such people cannot respect a doctors time.when explained that sometimes due to some other patients conditions can take more time depending upon the seriousness of complain , and this can delay the consultation of following patient. Patient started shouting \"then why do u take appointment\"?.. Have cctv evidences to show. Seriously??, thinking a DOCTOR as COMMODITY is not going to help. I believe this particular patient require's psychological counseling and definitely some good manners. I wish u all the best for ur mental health journey. And wish u all the love and light missing in your precious life. Take care. Life is a echo of karma.Get well soon. NOTE- basic manners is when meeting a doctor especially one who handles emergency like labour patients, bleeding or other obs gyn emergency, delay is expected. Since one cannot predict when ur patients require ur personal care. Just expecting non emergency patients to understand \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd17",

They take appointments more than thier capacity.We had appointment at 7:45 pm with gyno Dr Radhika and they made us waited for more than 1.5 hours and finally we had consulatation at 9:15 pm. Having 1 year kid with us, it was very difficult hold the kid till these long wait time. Reception folks says it will just take 10mins and finally ended waiting for 1.5 hrs. With baby being hungry, we lost patience and asked refund. They are not ready to refund rather they said, its gonna take another 10 mins. After consultation, doctor started arguing with us and said we shall have patience to visit hospital and argued stupidly with us not to visit hospital if we can't wait for 2 hours in hospital . Many people had suffered that day who had appointment . She is impolite and rude to us who is source of her income. I strongly don't recommend not to go that hospital and visit this lady Radhika gyno unless you have good energy and can burn your time and money there. **** ***** *** ******** ******* ******** *** *** **** *** *** *** ***** ******** **** **** *********",

After two months in anomaly scan I found some complications in the scan like, single umbilical artery, calcium in heart, one leg not grown as expected. After all our findings madam told nothing to worry,, but we will do one 2D echo scan. We agreed and committed to do follow up with mam, then after every stage we faced different complications from 27th week on wards, but in every stage mam, suggested and explained the situations and made us so strong and she took personal care of me and she used to give prompt response in whatsapp also.  That's the care mam shown towards me, and she assured me that you will get baby with in 36-37 weeks in between. Exactly I got the healthy baby girl after completion of 37 weeks. By gods grace we are so happy now. We can say a great thanks to Doctor Radhika madam for her great support ",

However, upon coming across positive reviews for Doctor Radhika, I happened to consult her at Cloudnine Hospital, Old Airport Road from day 1 of my pregnancy and honestly, I did not have any regrets or second thoughts. Doctor Radhika is a gem of a person who will understand your problems and guide you accordingly.\n\nAlthough, I did face problems with respect to my pregnancy, doctor Radhika was always there to help me overcome them and didn't recommend unnecessary medications. She was always a text away in case of any queries. She is somebody who gives ample time to her patients and helps resolve any concern. Doctor Radhika always instilled positivity during uncertain times and I will always be grateful to her for the same.\n\nI delivered a baby boy last month and I will forever be thankful. Thank you Doctor Radhika !! \u2764\ufe0f",

I felt very safe under her guidance and treatment. \nWhen I returned from Dehradun during my second month, I was on heavy medications which Doc Radhika asked me to stop because there was no such complication, she explained and it really helped me mentally as well physically as I was highly nauseated at that time. \n*** ***** ***** *********** *********** *** ***** ********** *********** ***** **** I experienced in my previous pregnancy.

I am really very impressed with how she explains each and every process and reports.  \nIn my whole pregnancy she kept me guiding for each and everything not just the medicines but with the diet too, she always encourages for the home remedies rather than medicine. \nWith her motherly care and support we got the best gift of our life our darling daughter. I had almost given up and was asking for C-section but she consoled me like a mom and I had a normal delivery.\n I recommend Dr Radhika to everyone who is looking for a smooth pregnancy journey and normal delivery.\nThank you Dr Radhika for everything and we will always be grateful to you!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n",

Under her guidance, prompt responses (over phone as well) & treatment now we are blessed with a healthy baby. She listens to the problems very patiently & accordingly prescribes treatment.\n\nShe does not encourage unnecessary tests, medicines for usage of money from patients & supports us to try naturally as there were no profound reasons found for our  last stillbirth case. My wife got pregnant after ~7 months of consultation. In the 3rd trimester, complications started & we again started panicking but She handled the problem very efficiently & with utmost care. By her treatment, we ultimately crossed all the hurdles . The support staff in her clinic ( SARV ADVANCED MULTISPECIALITY CLINIC AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTRE )  are very friendly .\n\n*** ** * ****** *** ** *** We panicked with Fatal stress at 3AM in the morning but she immediately rushed to Hospital (Cloudnine Old Airport Road)  and reached us within minutes.  Her magical treatment gave us a new life. W/O Her we would not have seen this day. We don't have words to say thanks to Her. We pray to GOD that she gets more strength, courage & blessings from the Almighty so that she can bring more & more happiness in the life of Couples. I strongly recommend Dr. Radhika Kamuni to the ones who are looking for good consultation and guidance in Bangalore.",

Right?. Nowadays, education cannot guarantee, basic manners in a person. Just because you have paid a consultation doesn't mean you should not follow rules, maintain decorum in a clinic. Such people think creating a ruckus and showing disrespect towards a doctor makes them superior??, no ..it shows lack of empathy towards people. Patient came for a non emergency issue, even after seeing doctor being very busy and seeing emergency patients they started creating a ruckus at the reception. When offered a refund( yes patient is lying, was offered a complete refund, but refused saying would like to meet the concerned authority) when informed that -then have to meet doctor herself.Now patient waited till her turn( now waiting was not a conern) just to humiliate, disrespect the doctor. After her turn she very well took good 30 mins for a non emergency concern.( now baby being hungry etc are immaterial to them) When asked politely what was the issue, why were u creating a ruckus outside?..unable to give a logical explanation, started abusing, backanswering , hawling. It's easy to defame a DOCTOR,isn't it? . Just one lame, false review cannot change the truth. I can guarantee many of my patient can give testimony about my behavior ( don't require ur false tag). Such people cannot respect a doctors time.when explained that sometimes due to some other patients conditions can take more time depending upon the seriousness of complain , and this can delay the consultation of following patient. Patient started shouting \"then why do u take appointment\"?.. Have cctv evidences to show. Seriously??, thinking a DOCTOR as COMMODITY is not going to help. I believe this particular patient require's psychological counseling and definitely some good manners. I wish u all the best for ur mental health journey. And wish u all the love and light missing in your precious life. Take care. Life is a echo of karma.Get well soon. NOTE- basic manners is when meeting a doctor especially one who handles emergency like labour patients, bleeding or other obs gyn emergency, delay is expected. Since one cannot predict when ur patients require ur personal care. Just expecting non emergency patients to understand \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd17",

They take appointments more than thier capacity.We had appointment at 7:45 pm with gyno Dr Radhika and they made us waited for more than 1.5 hours and finally we had consulatation at 9:15 pm. Having 1 year kid with us, it was very difficult hold the kid till these long wait time. Reception folks says it will just take 10mins and finally ended waiting for 1.5 hrs. With baby being hungry, we lost patience and asked refund. They are not ready to refund rather they said, its gonna take another 10 mins. After consultation, doctor started arguing with us and said we shall have patience to visit hospital and argued stupidly with us not to visit hospital if we can't wait for 2 hours in hospital . Many people had suffered that day who had appointment . She is impolite and rude to us who is source of her income. I strongly don't recommend not to go that hospital and visit this lady Radhika gyno unless you have good energy and can burn your time and money there. **** ***** *** ******** ******* ******** *** *** **** *** *** *** ***** ******** **** **** *********",

Unexpectedly I got a chance to meet Dr. Radhika \nS. Kamuni mam,since I ran into an emergency I met radhika mam. She treated me like a friend and understood my problem and gave me the treatment. After two months in anomaly scan I found some complications in the scan like, single umbilical artery, calcium in heart, one leg not grown as expected. After all our findings madam told nothing to worry,, but we will do one 2D echo scan. We agreed and committed to do follow up with mam, then after every stage we faced different complications from 27th week on wards, but in every stage mam, suggested and explained the situations and made us so strong and she took personal care of me and she used to give prompt response in whatsapp also.  That's the care mam shown towards me, and she assured me that you will get baby with in 36-37 weeks in between. Exactly I got the healthy baby girl after completion of 37 weeks. By gods grace we are so happy now. We can say a great thanks to Doctor Radhika madam for her great support ",

Doctor Radhika is a gem of a person who will understand your problems and guide you accordingly.\n\nAlthough, I did face problems with respect to my pregnancy, doctor Radhika was always there to help me overcome them and didn't recommend unnecessary medications. She was always a text away in case of any queries. She is somebody who gives ample time to her patients and helps resolve any concern. Doctor Radhika always instilled positivity during uncertain times and I will always be grateful to her for the same.\n\nI delivered a baby boy last month and I will forever be thankful.

The way she held my hand at times relieved me of all my pain.  With her motherly care and support we got the best gift of our life...our son.

It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient! Also wanted to mention that Dr. Radhika was a wonderful surgeon, and the staff was always helpful and kind. They ensured I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up. I am so glad I chose cloud nine and would highly recommend to anyone.\n\n\nThank you Radhika Mam, *** *** *** **** ****** \u2764\ufe0f",

She is very friendly and her explanations are quite detailed. Instead of prescribing supplements she focuses on diet and home remedies. Her timely intervention was very helpful whenever we faced issues. She actually made efforts in making sure that I have normal delivery which was finally the case. During the last month she was always available on phone to help us out and answer any queries. Overall an amazing experience and I would strongly recommend her. ",

Doctor explained each of these issues in detail to me and care/medication to be taken. I ended up having an emergency c-section at about 36 weeks due to certain complications. Doctor managed all of it very well and with ease. With doctor Radhika, I also felt I was in right hand as she always made me feel at ease. \n\nShe is very involved with her patients and available for her patients, she answered all my queries on Watsapp with regards to my pregnancy.

I have approached other doctors in my early stage of pregnancy but starting from 5th month onwards i have continued consulting Radhika mam as I felt her availability and the kind of response is good as she listens our concerns and explains in detailed manner.  I was in different assumption before going to Raimbow as they always prefer to deliver through c section but with Radhika mam i clearly discussed as i am anticipating this to be in normal delivery.  She suggested all required exercises and necessary medications, finally she only the doctor at the time of delivery.  Now i got a baby boy in normql delivery and discharged from the hospital within 2 days.  Thanks to Rainbow hospital and Radhika mam.",

She motivated us that we don't have infertility and she promised that she will make us to deliver healthy baby in the next cycle. I have followed some home medications for pcos and i have conceived naturally at 3rd time and radhika mam confirmed that it is twins. Finally two boy babies got delivered in my home town as this is my first pregnancy. Even after we moved to home town, she will clear all my doubts through WhatsApp with prompt response. But we won't forget radhika mam as she is next to God to us\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f. Once again thank you mam for ur support during our ups and downs \ud83d\ude42.",

Ma'am helped in getting a quick diagnosis and understanding of the issue. With mam's experience and skills, was able to overcome subchorionic hemorrhage, placenta previa and then got timely cervical encirclage to prevent early cervical dilation in my second pregnancy. Was able to give birth to a healthy baby through normal delivery and it is all thanks to doctor's expertise & constant support. Ma'am has turned out to be a God sent angel for us. She is very friendly and compassionate towards her patients, listens to all our queries and concerns, explains in detail about the required medications and procedures. Easily the best doctor I have ever met. 100% recommend ma'am to anyone looking for a doctor for pregnancy consultation or any other gync. issues.",

She listened to my problems and suggested for vaginal swab test and gave me right antibiotics. Every doctor might do the same, but Dr Radhika created a difference. She is very friendly, clearly explained me about all the questions I had and made sure I understand what the infection is and how to be cautious about it to avoid the same in future. She made me so comfortable that I did not feel like I visited a doctor, thanks alot for that mam. I strongly recommend you to my friends and family members.",

Many things in medical practice requires clinical examination to diagnose, which the patient denied and was disappointed.As far as video consultation is concerned, patients  phone network was too bad and I could not connect video at all( that's her technical problem) she too tried doing video which was not getting connected( again technical problem). Now the real problem arises, patient started saying she has dark pigmentation on back of neck, near thigh, etc, I asked her to send pics, on seeing pics I understood its not hormonal but it's a skin condition, I explained the issue and gave symptomatic ointment, but advised for dermatologist opinion, on which patient again was not willing. And it triggered her to give the above review. Patient should understand not all can be managed by gynecologist. ",
