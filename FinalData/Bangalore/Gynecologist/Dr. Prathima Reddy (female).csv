"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"
Dr. Prathima Reddy exemplifies the epitome of dedication. We were expecting our first child and we went through the anxious moments in the last few weeks before delivery, as any expecting couple would. At such moments, Prathima Madam's words were soothing, her observations were steely and the occasional one liners were just perfect for us - nothing more, nothing less.

10 PM, 28th Dec 2017: As ""D"" day was nearing, i knew one of the most important person and the ""to be"" most important person of my life is in the right hands. Everything was planned for the next morning - observations, precautions and attention to detail.

Though, things changed dramatically over the next four hours, as any pregnancy at later stage can turn out to be. Dr Reddy was informed by the ever caring duty staff.

It was late in the night at about 2:15 AM, 29th Dec. A team of doctors led by Dr. Prathima was ready on a war footing. Most of them were awake attending to the live reports. They rushed to the hospital within no time. Among the commotion and anxiety, I knew it was a critical case but at the same time the best people were attending to my wife. Sometime, you know someone is taking care of you, as you would take care of yourself with all the available resources at your hand. 

6 Hours and 45 minutes later, right at the swiping in time in IT parlance, at 8:59:13 IST, we were blessed to have a healthy mother and child in our hand.

In this beautiful world, there are many people performing their duty to the best of their ability and who can put a hand on their heart and say, yes i did the best. Dr Reddy, for me, is one such soul! Ably supported by her staff :)

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I met her when I was pregnant for the first time, n my first pregnancy was little bit complicated 
My baby‚Äôs growth was slow, liqueur was less etc. so she had to keep seeing  my baby n it‚Äôs growth often with scans etc n she was concerned about my health as well she took care of me n my baby till the end m. . 
she took a decision of delivering me 10 days earlier then my due date which was on13/05/2016 but I delivered on 3rd May 2016 as she asked me to get admitted on 30/04/2016 evening as she is going to induce me for labour as she felt there was no point in waiting more 
As my baby‚Äôs growth was already stopped, basically my baby was small baby for how much it actually suppose to be üôÅ but she told me not to worry my baby is absolutely a healthy baby n it will pick up its growth once it out of my womb. 1st n 2nd May they tried to get me into labour through some jell which is to put once in six hours but even after putting it for the fourth time I didn‚Äôt get my labour pain so 
3rd early morning prathima  mam decided to induce 
Me which caused me shivering but no real labour pain
As I said it was early in the morning they took me to labour room around 5am, Mam was not around but every second she was monitoring me from where ever she was.. she was taking my report from the doctor n nurses who were present with  me n guiding them step by step till she herself came to me  
Later they broke my water bag after which finally I was in pain, true labour pain . . .  
I was not able to bare I was crying n only thing I would ask the nurses was where is mam n when all this is gonna end . . . 
I don‚Äôt know what was going on and y the baby was not coming out they even took signatures from my mom that if things go worse they might go for C Section as well 
Which left all my family members worried.
Around 9am I finally saw prathima mam which gave me little strength, she didn‚Äôt hurry or took a call for C- Section she waited n kept monitoring the baby‚Äôs condition she just told me along with the pain when I start feeling like passing motion let the nurse know n went down to OPD where other patients were waiting for her around 10/ 10:15 am I told them & they shifted me to delivery room n mam just checked n went down again , thinking it would take some more time but I started pushing n within no time the head of the baby was visible so all the nurses around me just ran to call mam n the dr who was attending me asked me to stop üò≥ n hold 
Mam came running to me she started preparing herself as well as me by putting my legs up cleaning etc . . . N one thing she was telling me when she was doing all that was Azeema don‚Äôt push, don‚Äôt push hold until I say I was like mam I can‚Äôt üò≠ . . . Someone literally was holding my baby‚Äôs head from a finger to stop until everything is all clear finally mam had done all the nessecities an she began to to tell me to push 
Push Azeema push,  May be  I was very week not doing great that to at that peak time n literally mam 
Ordered me ‚ÄúAzeema I want ur baby now‚Äù  with she by my side encouraging me I gave the final push and the baby was out she said congratulations Azeema 
It‚Äôs a baby boy üòä I could never forget that moment in my life she just turned  that complicated delivery into normal delivery for which mainly I choose her cause I didn‚Äôt want to go for C Sec on any cost first I thank Almighty Allah then her

I'd highly recommend her for the expertise, experience, and real care that she demonstrated while explaining the course of action and setting realistic expectations about medication side effects and next steps. I had consulted multiple doctors in the past, had a laparoscopic removal of a cyst a decade back at a different hospital, after which some doctors suggested hysterctomy, some suggested endoscopy, and all of whom suggested just painkillers for pain management. 
Dr. Reddy is the first doctor who prescribed specific medication for addressing the endometriosis, with follow ups. She also specifically stated that surgery was unnecessary and not a first course of action. I felt reassured after speaking to her that I was in good hands and look forward to a resolution to my long-standing health issue over time. 
I'd similarly recommend Dr. Deepthi, who gathered my case history and prepared notes for Dr Reddy (as I was a new patient) before I consulted her, for her ability to ask questions sensitively and listen reassuringly - these skills make a ton of difference to diagnosis, whereas my experience elsewhere in recent times has been hurried conversations that didn't really try to get to the root of the problem and had me really concerned about the state of my health.
About Fortis LaFemme - I was pleased that contrary to expectations of delay set by the operator when I called, I didn't have to wait long despite being a walk-in patient, likely because it was a week-day, mid-week, and in the evening.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"We were trying to conceive for a while without much success when our cousin recommended us to visit Dr Prathima Reddy. Evidently that decision proved to be prudent.

Dr Reddy is gifted, very passionate about her work and has the ability to make her patients feel at ease during her consultation. She is very systematic in her approach and explains everything very clearly.We always came back with a positive feeling after interacting with her. Her attention to detail is impeccable. We heard from the nurses that she was constantly monitoring vitals and other parameters as late as 2 AM on the day prior to our baby's delivery. Susbequently she was at the hospital early in the morning for the delivery procedure. Such devotion is rare in this day and age. 

We are ever indebted to Dr Reddy and hope that many others benefit from her expertise and skills. 

Thank You Dr Prathima Reddy for all that you did for us.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,Dr Pratima reddy is great. Only the hospital and the nurses need to get their systems in place better. No one is aware of what‚Äôs going on. Everyone is too scared of Dr Reddy to ask a question. Patient has had on the bed waiting for the doctor for 25 mins and no one tells you anything. The assistant doctors shouldn‚Äôt change so often and without notice. It‚Äôs not right for a patient to explain their case every visit since the doctor is new to you. Doesn‚Äôt make the patient feel comfortable. Nurses and staff don‚Äôt think outside the box. It‚Äôs all very haphazard and only because everyone is pertried of Dr Reddy. ,2018-07-30 14:15:19,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
