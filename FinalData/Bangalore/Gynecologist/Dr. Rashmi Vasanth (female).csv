,,0,0,YES,"Well to say about my experience with Dr Rashmi goes from 2013-2014, even though she has been my cousin's friend, she treats her patients with the same care as if she is looking after one of her near and dear. My daughter was delivered in the hands Dr Rashmi only. She treated my wife with atmost care and responsibility. I still remember she arrived at the hospital in the wee hours and stayed until my kidoo was delivered safe and healthy. I recommend Dr Rashmi Vasanth for all your needs related to OB-GYN. Dr Rashmi Vasanth is simply down to earth and humble doctor who has vast knowledge of what she does and whom she treats. Half of your problems are solved by way she speaks to you itself. God bless her with health and wealth. ",2022-07-09 07:04:05,False,True,Vijay Kumar S ,,,
,,0,0,YES,"It's was our first visit to Dr. Rashmi for NT scan of my wife yesterday and the way she handled everything was awesome. I was reffered to her with one of our family known doctor and truly it was my best experience in Bangalore. She did an detailed analysis of my wife and explain each and every small things to my wife during the scan. Also it was so nice of her to again put the same efforts to explain everything to me again showing our baby on screen.. The way she was explaining few things I was getting emotional sometime thinking someone from my family is sitting at doctor seat. Thanks man for giving us such nice experience and answering all our questions. Being an outsider from UP, I felt overwhelmed by your gesture and support. Now we feel that we are at right place & in right hands.. Also the other staff members at the kshema diagnostic centre is very polite and supportive. Truly recommend place to visit for pregnancy scans.. THANKS..!!",2020-08-29 07:32:38,False,True,Ashish Pandey,,,
