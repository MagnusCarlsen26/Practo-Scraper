None,None,0,0,NO,"With knowledge comes wisdom. But it is not the case here. The doctor has knowledge but lacks the basic courtesy of talking politely and patiently with patients. I visited her today, she quickly explained what needs to be done, suggested a ultrasound/MRI/CT Scan, whichever suits by pocket.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Started Consulting Dr Namita Kapoor after 34 week of pregnancy due to bad experience from previous doctor. After a long search and reading lot of reviews we got some confidence to meet and discuss our next course of action. Since day one we got good confidence on her and with every visit this confidence level increased and we decided to proceed for rest of the process with Dr. Namita Kapoor (with a regret why we didn't choose her since start). 

We liked the suggestions and the process she follows for whole consulting process to keep it as Natural as possible. And even when other doctors starts scaring with few natural minor complications like in our case for 1 loop round the neck and other doctors were scaring and forcing us to plan early delivery (cesarean post 32 week or 36 week max) because of this which was not necessary. 

Dr. Namita checked all the previous scans and reports and said because of this there is no need to plan early delivery. we can still wait till last day (with monitoring baby movements at home) and still Normal delivery can be tried. In case baby do not come down and heartbeat fluctuates while trying then on last day last option will be caesarean otherwise most of the cases Normal delivery is possible. We were convinced with the way she told at least she is still trying for normal delivery and there can be chance we can have baby delivered without caesarean. 

On the Day of delivery. She tried her level best to get baby delivered normally but we can see that every time its tried the baby heartbeat was fluctuating. So considering 2 complications (loop around the neck and baby poop in womb) and heartbeat fluctuation while trying for normal delivery we have to go for emergency caesarean delivery or it will be risk to the baby that we can understand. 

Our satisfaction was like Doctor tried her level best for normal delivery that was enough for us to still keep on continuing with Dr. Namita for any of our future need. She is great doctor and this kind of attitude and skills are rare nowadays. I highly recommend Dr Namita to anyone who is really concerned about Normal and Natural process and avoid unnecessary intervention. She has great history of Normal delivery even in some complicated cases with great knowledge and skills.

Special thanks to Dr. Namita Kapoor for all the support and taking care of what is needed. I would like to thanks Columbia Asia Hospital too for the seamless process and good arrangements made during the process. And last but not the least thanks to the hospital staff for full support at any time round the clock. ",2021-09-28 10:01:21,False,True,Ashish,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"It was one of my best friend who referred me to the Dr. Namita Kapoor Sehgal when I was going to have my first baby.And believe me it was proved to be one of the best descision I have made in the recent past to consult Dr. Namitha. Being first time pregnant my mind was full of questions, concerns & useless unnecessary thought. But after consulting the Dr everything was cleared and my pregnancy journey throughout the baby delivery was smooth & planned. 
     	During these 9 months I got sick many a time but just one advice  from the doctor worked like a charm and I recovered fast. The doctor was always reachable on watsapp/phone during the pregnancy starting 7th months because after this only the critical time of any pregnancy starts as per my experience.
	 Initially after going through certain feedback on Practo saying the Dr. was little ruude to them I was also little sceptical but believe me I was proved wrong  with each consultation.Since during the first 6-7 months & carrying the 1st baby our mind is full with thousand of unnecessary question so to take care of those the Dr. had to be like a teacher little strict & always caring to tell you what is right & what is wrong.And sometime we want to be told in a certain way that clears our doubt.And then comes the part when you feel connected with the doctor because of the motherly feeling you get when you are with her.
         My situation was that I was carrying a big baby inside me. My little princess was 4+ kg when she took birth. Still the Dr. left no stone turned to make sure that I go for a normal delivery rather than c-section. Till the due date I could not have my labor pain & there was no point of inducing me as the baby head was not fitted yet in my cervix. And because of this I had to go for a c-section on my 40th week 4th day of pregnancy.As the doctor also predicted before birth that the Baby is 4+ kg in weigh & it was proved to be correct.
	Believe me after 15 days of my operation when I think of all the wild thought & scariness I had for c-section all seems silly. It was all because of Dr. Namita Kapoor that my operation was so smooth it feels like a thing of long past already.Post operation day, I am able to manage my house chores, taking care of my baby all by myself.Already its a so faint scar on my bikini line that it doesn't look line I was ever operated (just passed 15 days from operation day). Now also doctor is always available on a phone call & watsapp (unlike other doctors).
	Doctors Care made me feel that I was in safe hands always. Coming to her is like dealing with trusted family. I can never think of consulting any other Dr.. I will blindly & always refer my friends to her & even consult her my 2nd baby if at all I am going for one. :)

She explains every issue very nicely and talks to the point. My consultation experience with her was very nice from starting till now after the delivery.Delivery experience: My edd was 10th june and i did not got natural pains till 9th june so doctor advised me to get admitted the next day for induced pain but i wanted to wait for natural pains and discussed the same with her. She told you can wait few more days if you want but get regular nst and ultrasound scans. We followed the same for next 3 days, everything was normal and i got natural pain on 4th day. Got admitted in hospital and i was only 2 cm dialated, we got to know that baby has passed stool in the womb as we waited post edd. There was panic in OT as there were chances that baby might get infected if he consumes the stool. So doctor told me that she would try for normal delivery for next 30 mins but if baby heartbeat fluctuates then we will go for caserian birth. Thankfully i was fully dialated in next 20 mins and baby heartbeat was constant. Dr. Namita closely monitored everything and took right decisions at that time. I had very smooth natural delivery within 1 hour of getting admitted in hospital. She is very experienced and talented in this field and i would highly recommend everyone to consult her for delivery.I would be thankful to her for my entire life for this normal delivery in such panic situation.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"1. I regularly visit her for my gynac problems since I came to Whitefield 3 yrs before.  She was very gud n listens to our problems politely. She doesn't recommend too many medicines unless it is required.

2. With the gud opinion visited her for my second pregnancy.  I had diabetes from my first trimester itself. So she referred me to an endocrinologist who is very gud indeed.  she wanted all the scans to be done by the specialist who are very good.  She guided me very well.  
She is easily approachable both by mobile and in hospital. 
Though my first delivery was c section,  she wanted me to go for normal delivery for the second one.  She wanted to wait till my due date.  But I was mentally very  weak to bare the last month pain and restlessness.  I have visited her atleast 3 times in 10 days in the tenth month. Everytime I visit her I will go with some complain that not able to breathe,  sleep,  eat,  walk though I know that these all natural problems in the last month. She will console me and send back to home. 

Everytime we go,  my husband  used to ask too many questions.  But she was so polite to answer everything.

She also clearly explained the hospital procedures for delivery. 

Finally I ended up in c section in 38 weeks. I didn't want to take risk of normal delivery.  My husband somehow convinced the doctor.  

Even during operation she told me that I could have waited for normal delivery becoz my previous scar has healed well. 

Throughout this 9 months she was very caring,  approachable even at 11 PM n also strict abt my diet becoz of diabetes. 

I would highly recommend her for all. ",2018-12-13 10:42:37,False,True,LakshmiPriya Devaraj,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Labor and Delivery,Cervical Cerclage,",0,0,YES,"With First Pregnancy every couple having certain expectation from the doctor and hospital service. The way Dr. Namita guided us at each stage, each passing week and giving the best of the advice which helped us to get a healthy and safe delivery with near to full term.

During the initial scan we discovered that the pregnancy was with bicornuate uterus and in the right horn, this having a risk of early or pre-term labor and also impact baby's growth. Looking to this Dr. Namita suggested to go for a cervical cerclage. As this is very new to us and first time we are very skeptical about this and we did some online study to understand what are the Pros and Cons of doing a Cerclage, Honestly Cercalage is still not common in India and we hardly found any supportive or relevant feedback. (Most of them are from US or other part of world).

We decided to trust the doctor and her experience and did a cervical cerclage and it has given a expected result as the Pregnancy able to cover near to full term (37 Week) with a normal growth for the baby.
During the 37 week as we found that due to some impact on Liver we need to take a decision to hold till 40 Week and wait for labor or to go for a C-sec as this liver dysfunctioning can cause health issue with mother. Dr. Namita discussed all possibilities with us and we decided to go for C-sec as baby is fully grown and we do not want to risk mother health.

On the final day Dr. Namita spent an hour with us explaining about the C-sec and pre and post procedure and risk. (Which you hardly expect in India by any doctor).

To summarize we high appreciate and thank full to Dr. Namita to be there and advising us to have the most precious gift of life.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"""Brilliant"" is what sums up the entire experience we had with Dr.Namita, over the course of a year.   We got her reference from Practo itself and based on the review experience and ratings, we decided to go to her initially. Being apprehensive as all to-be parents are, we were not sure of anything in the beginning. But after a couple of visits we were confidant of one thing, if not anything else, that she would be the doctor we wanted to continue for the entire time. Dr. Namita is straight-forward and precise to a point where it might be considered rude by some, but in our experience we realized that, this specific attribute is what we required to be in our doctor. She would not spend time in unnecessary details and explanation not pertinent to the well-being of the baby and the parent. Our session with her were short, precise, to the point and detailed with respect to relevance. She never prescribed any test or medicines which would not be imperative to the baby's or mothers health and constructive progress throughout the course of 9 months. She specifically mentioned what and where to do the test and not to go for any unnecessary expenses. My wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter at exactly 40 + 1 week. Dr.Namita’s support was the maximum at the end. We had opted for a normal delivery, she also supported the same. For my wife however, the pain did not come on its own, even on the due date, Dr.Namita was fully patient and wanted to wait for normal, and went for an induced pain. After 3 inducements, my wife started responding, it was almost 24 hours the contraction pain started, it was taking her a long time to go into labor, but Dr Namita was willing to wait even more and explained everything to us in pristine detail. It was completely our decision to go for a C-section, even though she told us there’s a good possibility of a normal delivery, only it would require little more time. Once our decision was done and confirmed she took my wife to the OT. Within 15-20 min the operation was done and my wife and our daughter came out all well and healthy. Even on the 2 days my wife was admitted for recovery, Dr.Namita came on regular visits checked her thoroughly and prescribed very little medicine. She was discharged from the hospital within 2 days all healthy and fine.
As I mentioned above, the experience was nothing short of brilliant in every aspect with full support and precise treatment. 
Thank you Dr. Namita.

She specifically mentioned what and where to do the test and not to go for any unnecessary expenses. My wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter at exactly 40 + 1 week. Dr.Namita’s support was the maximum at the end. We had opted for a normal delivery, she also supported the same. For my wife however, the pain did not come on its own, even on the due date, Dr.Namita was fully patient and wanted to wait for normal, and went for an induced pain. After 3 inducements, my wife started responding, it was almost 24 hours the contraction pain started, it was taking her a long time to go into labor, but Dr Namita was willing to wait even more and explained everything to us in pristine detail. It was completely our decision to go for a C-section, even though she told us there’s a good possibility of a normal delivery, only it would require little more time. Once our decision was done and confirmed she took my wife to the OT. Within 15-20 min the operation was done and my wife and our daughter came out all well and healthy. Even on the 2 days my wife was admitted for recovery, Dr.Namita came on regular visits checked her thoroughly and prescribed very little medicine. She was discharged from the hospital within 2 days all healthy and fine.
As I mentioned above, the experience was nothing short of brilliant in every aspect with full support and precise treatment. 
Thank you Dr. Namita.

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Her words after my normal delivery "" You did it the way God has designed you to do so"" were so soothing and reassuring . We thanked God for choosing Dr Namita for our child's delivery.

Being New to Bangalore we did not had any idea which hospital is good and which Gynac to consult . We walked in to Columbia Asia hospital with a fear( I believe all have this fear ) that whether we are making a right choice and whether we will get a good doctor , today we feel vindicated that we made a perfect choice . 

When we first met her , we found her very friendly and knowledgeable, with whom we could discuss any issues we faced . She was available on call anytime and in case she was not available on call you could easily send her an message and she responded to each and every query . 

Also she never suggested any unnecessary tests and advised us very correctly in case of physiotherapy and other pregnancy related costs.

During the course of pregnancy she guided us on every minute thing to take care of and become more of a caring friend then a doctor  . As we desired for a normal delivery she suggested what all will be helpful . And truly each and every of her advise helped . 

During the last trimester she gave us a clear way ahead preparing us for a course of delivery and the best caring part of her was that she told us that I am available 24X7 now ( on phone text or in person) . And we could call her at any odd hour whenever we felt some issue was there . 

In my 9th month due to some complications ( Liver been impacted) Dr Namita took a wise decision to prepone my delivery by 3 weeks and I delivered a healthy angel  by normal delivery. 

Even after delivery she readily answers our queries on phone and whatsapp even though we have shifted to Delhi now .  

With this brief testimony we would thank to D Namita and would say when we look back without a hint of doubt I will say Dr Namita is one of the best Gynac . 

A Big Thank You and God Bless you . Will always drop by to say Hello to you whenever I visit Bangalore in future :-) ",2016-02-15 18:32:50,False,True,Shweta Singh,,,

Then we switched to Columbia Asia Hospital (Dr. Namita also visits there) as the various tests and the Labour room as well as OT were upto the mark. She guided us patiently and sometime treated like a mom (because my wife had GD and TSH) and was very strict for blood sugar level monitoring as well as keep a tab on her weight gain.

Dr. Namita talks to the point and explains everything in detail. If you've done some research & know things in medical terms, then also she will be happy about it and explains rest of it, unlike other doctors who get offended  (I don't understand why). 
She takes care of the baby like her own till the end. Her positive attitude towards everything calms you down instantly. The tests and the medications are to the point. She does not suggest to go for meds unless really needed. She shares her number later in Pregnancy for the doubts or any emergency and responds via whatsapp too. In fact, post delivery too.

We had shifted from Pune to Bangalore when I was 17 week pregnant and was leaving with a fear of how would the doctor take care of me during pregnancy but when we met her on day one we were satisfied that we are in the right and safe hands. 

She gave ample time and and answered all my questions very calmly and very patiently in the best possible way.

The best part of her was an assurance from her saying you can contact 24 x 7 and to be very honest she responded to all my queries be it any time of the day.

She always assured that we will go only with normal delivery and never hurry for a C section.

The best part came from her at the time of my delivery when I landed up for emergency C section and was fearing how long it would take for the doctor to come but she was there in no time and completed the procedure successfully and handed over my baby safely in my arms. She also took good post natal care of me by giving good advices. 

Post delivery when she used to come for the rounds her care for me used to make me feel very comfortable as if a mother is talking to her daughter.

She is indeed very caring and very knowledgeable and very down to earth doctor. I and my husband have already referred her and would always do so to any one in need.

Post-delivery, she gave many tips on sitting postures, feeding baby and how to avoid abdomen belt - in India, only few doctors do this. She visited us often to ensure that I and baby are doing good.

From the very first visit, her confidence and experience was evident from the conversation
She explained the situation  and  gave us the confidence to go through it. Through out my pregnancy i had complications but Dr.Namita handled it so well that it even made us confident. She is very honest and ethical. She will listen to you with a lot of patience...she won't make you go through unnecessary tests..she always has that personal touch and you feel like you're talking to a family member.

What we found good about this doctor is her good and calm behaviour. I believe, for a Gynaecologists it is key to be a good listener. And this is indeed a quality in her.She is very systematic in her work and always puts a smiling face. She avoids unnecessary scans and hospital trips.She shared her number and asked to call or whatsapp whenever we need her assistance.
