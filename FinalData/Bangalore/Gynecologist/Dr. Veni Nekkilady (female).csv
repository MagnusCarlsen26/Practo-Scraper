"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"I had my treatment from Dr. Veni at VR Chest and Women Care, Hennur, for my high risk pregnancy. Veni Mam is a guardian angel. I cant even imagine how i could have handled my pregnancy journey without her support and guidance. 

Her friendly approach, motherly care works at your subconscious level and gets everything go smooth. 
She is a very humble and down to earth person who makes you feel at ease and comfortable. I had multiple issues through out. With all these there was sudden insulin resistence and high bp during my last triemester. Then i had slipped and had a fall during my 9th month. 

Mam handled each and every problem with so much care and support. She constantly keeps in touch with you to check on how you progress. And the best part is she will always try for normal delivery, counsel you for normal delivery even if you choose to go with c section which is rare in todays scenerio. 

Post delivery my lil one had latching issues, i had low milk supply and mam continously comforted me to stay strong and recommended so many things that could help with milk supply. Also my baby had severe jaundice and we had frequent visits to hospital to consult the pead. At one point when we could not reach the pead and mam connected with the doc and helped us in that critical situation. I cant thank enough for her dedication and support.

We had to change doctors in our 5th month of pregnancy and a friend recommended Dr Veni. On our first visit she spent 1hr understanding our case history and interventions so far and patiently answered our myriad of questions. She was always available and responded quickly on whatsapp whenever I had a question. I had GDM and she ensured that we consulted a very good Diabetologist as well. She provided a personal touch all through our journey ensuring we were aware of all the interventions and assuring us that we can do it. She provided very practical advise and ensured we werent stressed about the scans etc. We had an induced labour which unfortunately didnt progress as planned. However she still kept encouraging us to try for a natural delivery. We in the end took a call for a C-sec and were blessed with a baby girl.  Post the surgery, my stitches got infected and Doctor ensured that she did everything to help me get over that infection. Dr Veni demonstrates a high level of responsibility towards you as a patient and really cares for you. She is very resourceful as well.  We are truly thankful for having consulted her to bring the bundle of joy into our lives.

I first went to her when i got pregnant and then had an unfortunate miscarriage. I have pcod and found it difficult to get pregnant again..i got ovulation treatment done by Dr veni. The miscarriage was in August 2021 and I got pregnant again in Feb 2022. In between there were many instances where i gave up as i was simply not getting pregnant but she motivated me to keep trying and we would track the ovulation cycles every month. I had about a zillion question and she answers everything clearly and patiently. These days when it is difficult to get a doctor to answer all your questions and they don't spare more than five minutes with you, veni mam is a rarity. Never ever have I left her clinic with any question unanswered till date.  With her treatment and support i finally got pregnant in Feb 2022 and what a beautiful journey it has been. Having a wonderful gynecologist can make all the difference. For the first three months i was literally paranoid due to the previous miscarriage experience. Veni mam never shot down any question, no query however silly went unanswered. No emergency went unattended.My pregnancy was a beautiful journey solely because she was my doctor. In September veni mam helped deliver my healthy baby girl. From ovulation induction process, lot of disappointment due to not getting pregnant again, the trauma from the first miscarriage.. veni mam has seen and guided me through everything.

The best Doctor I have came across, she has a pure soul and down to earth.
we came to know about Dr.Veni from our cousin.
It's our first baby and we really had a great experience with her. she guided us right from the start of our pregnancy till baby birth and encouraged us for Normal Delivery throughout the journey. Very Friendly, listens to all our problems very patiently and clears all our doubts and queries. she is always available over the phone for all our queries and doubts.
In my case it took a long time(34 hours) to deliver a baby, she encouraged and  gave confidence in each and every step of labor and had a vaginal delivery.
Great quality of medical care. I highly recommend her to all my friends.
