"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Abortion / Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP),",0,0,NO,"so me and husband wanted to do a MTP as we were not ready for the child. and we were wanting the best doctor for us as we did not want any complications in the future. so we found dr Vanita Vaishnav and checked the reviews and thought she would be the best pic.(not knowing what was awaiting us)
we went there and discussed, so she was very polite and asked us to get my blood tests and ultrasound done so that she could proceed further. and asked us to send the reports on whatsapp and called us at Apollo clinic(HSR layout). she told us about the whole procedure and asked us to pay while she gave the MTP kit to me. okay first of all the amount we paid for half an hour of her precious time, a MTP Kit for 300-400rs and an after MTP ultrasound (1500 Generally anywhere) was hefty(8.3k).but we didn't flinch at all thinking that she would be there guiding us about the complications and depression MTP could bring. And also the guidance on contraceptives methods were also a part of the procedure.
so she asked us to come back and take an ultrasound after a week or so of the procedure at Apollo only. we went there on time only to find out she wasn't there and probably was on vacation. we still didn't mind and had a call with her. the way she talked was not the same as she was talking before the amount was paid( actually we told, we were leaving the city soon, so would be better if she can meet or guide us further on contraception, she replied- just because u are leaving the city does not change my procedure). after the call, we went and asked the receptionist about the ultrasound. ohh God, the service that clinic provides is very bad, nobody pays attention to the patients, faced total ignorance from the entire team and the guy who was to do the ultrasound. after a long verbal spat, they kind of sent us to some other diagnostic centre. things at that diagnostic centre were fine.
so after the ultrasound and after few days, i was facing some serious depression, which i wanted to discuss with the doctor and thought may be she could give some input , but there wasn't any reply. i ignored and went on to ask about the contraceptive methods which she told she would definitely help with as its part of the procedure. messages were getting read , but i never got a single reply from her.

3. I had given you a very clear picture of the MTP package, with inclusions and exclusions.  It's pre decided by the clinic. Doctors don't interfere and don't don't have any say in it. 

4. Every absence from the clinic doesn't mean vacation. It can be emergencies( personal or professional). And like you said you had travel plan, doctors also have their plans and holidays. And as I said to you- I wouldnt prefer to change my clinical guidelines and procedure methods based on patients personal  issues.
