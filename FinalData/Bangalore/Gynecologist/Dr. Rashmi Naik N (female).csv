None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Rashmi is one of the few Doctors I have met who welcomes you with a Big smile when you enter her Clinic and makes you very comfortable. I had to undergo a surgery and was very scared and apprehensive  of the procedure. She  sat me down and explained in details and instilled a lot of confidence and prepared me mentally to undergo the Surgery. By God's grace and Dr. Rashmi's expertise and dedication to her profession, the surgery was very successful and I was discharged the next day. I should say she takes extra precautions when it comes to the patient's  health especially during this Covid- 19 times when we are fighting against an invisible enemy. When you visit her Clinic, she will give you an Apron, Gloves, Foot gloves and a bag to put in ur reports. The assistant will make sure she sanitises you thoroughly and lets you in. The Doctor also is in Full PPE Gear. I have not seen such precautions being implemented in Hospital !!!!.
