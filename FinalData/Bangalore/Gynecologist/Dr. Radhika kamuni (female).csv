Every time we used to go for a consultation and we used to get positive vibes and comfort that everything is fine.
Her instructions were very clear and well planned.

The doctor never hides anything and always gives a clear picture of the medical condition and treatment path she is going to follow.
I didn't find her anytime giving false hopes. She explains well that for your situation this is the path we have to take and motivated us.

I was tested COVID Positive at 29weeks, I and my husband were worried about the baby, but Dr. Radhika Kamuni positive vibes made us strong.
My husband was at home taking care of my elder kid, every day she was updating my condition to him.

Even though in night times, she is still available for help and always answers our queries through the phone which I really appreciate.
There are many such good qualities which you want to see in your doctor.

There is no doubt why this doctor has so many recommendations.

Thanks for all that you have done and keep doing the same great work! I wish you get more and more success & happiness.
God always keeps you safe and healthy as you are the hope for many women like me.
