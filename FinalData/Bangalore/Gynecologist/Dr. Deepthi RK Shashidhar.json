She not only diagnosed the underlying cause but also provided timely and effective treatment. Last year, around April, I found out that I was pregnant, and Maam has supported me a lot. Being pregnant for the first time, I was really confused, excited, and scared at the same time. Deepthi Maam has supported me a lot throughout my pregnancy journey. I always waited for the next month to arrive so that I could see my little one during the scanning period. She has patiently answered all the queries that I asked, and she is always available on phone calls or through messages. The conversations are very transparent. She suggested two hospitals for delivery. One was Apollo Cradle, and the other was Cloudnine. We went ahead with Cloudnine, and it was the best decision for us. I always wanted to go for normal delivery, and Maam really supported me in that decision. I was in labor for 19 hours and finally went ahead with the C section as the baby's heartbeat was decreasing. And she suggested going ahead with the C section for our safety. We agreed with her, and finally I am blessed with a healthy baby boyboy last December. Post-delivery, maam visited the hospital everyday to check on me and helped me with the lactation as well. I will be forever grateful to Maam for giving us such a wonderful experience. She will always be my go-to gynecologist and counselor as well. Her post-delivery care, including lactation support, was invaluable.\u00a0I must say that the clinic has good radiologist. Both of them are really patient and answered all my queries patiently. It has inhouse lab as well in collaboration with primadiagnostics so we do not have to visit other labs for any tests. I wish that first care clinic has its own OT in future. It would \u00a0be a great addition to the clinic. And the receptionist is very well behaved,\u00a0 she always calls me one day before appointment to remind me about my visit. She is really friendly, polite and good at her work.\u00a0I'm forever grateful for Dr Deepthi maam's expertise, compassion, and professionalism, and I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking gynecological care.",

She answers your questions in detail, especially during pregnancy, where you typically have a lot of questions and are unsure which of them are important and which are trivial. She takes time to explain the medical/clinical details as well if you ask and ensures you get the answers you need. She is the doctor we trusted during the pregnancy and delivery of both our kids, and we are really happy with her support.",

She not only diagnosed the underlying cause but also provided timely and effective treatment. Last year, around April, I found out that I was pregnant, and Maam has supported me a lot. Being pregnant for the first time, I was really confused, excited, and scared at the same time. Deepthi Maam has supported me a lot throughout my pregnancy journey. I always waited for the next month to arrive so that I could see my little one during the scanning period. She has patiently answered all the queries that I asked, and she is always available on phone calls or through messages. The conversations are very transparent. She suggested two hospitals for delivery. One was Apollo Cradle, and the other was Cloudnine. We went ahead with Cloudnine, and it was the best decision for us. I always wanted to go for normal delivery, and Maam really supported me in that decision. I was in labor for 19 hours and finally went ahead with the C section as the baby's heartbeat was decreasing. And she suggested going ahead with the C section for our safety. We agreed with her, and finally I am blessed with a healthy baby boyboy last December. Post-delivery, maam visited the hospital everyday to check on me and helped me with the lactation as well. I will be forever grateful to Maam for giving us such a wonderful experience. She will always be my go-to gynecologist and counselor as well. Her post-delivery care, including lactation support, was invaluable.\u00a0I must say that the clinic has good radiologist. Both of them are really patient and answered all my queries patiently. It has inhouse lab as well in collaboration with primadiagnostics so we do not have to visit other labs for any tests. I wish that first care clinic has its own OT in future. It would \u00a0be a great addition to the clinic. And the receptionist is very well behaved,\u00a0 she always calls me one day before appointment to remind me about my visit. She is really friendly, polite and good at her work.\u00a0I'm forever grateful for Dr Deepthi maam's expertise, compassion, and professionalism, and I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking gynecological care.",

One thing that really stood out for us with Dr. Deepthi is her proactiveness; she prescribes the right medicine according to your specific condition without a \"let's see how it goes\" attitude. She answers your questions in detail, especially during pregnancy, where you typically have a lot of questions and are unsure which of them are important and which are trivial. She takes time to explain the medical/clinical details as well if you ask and ensures you get the answers you need. She is the doctor we trusted during the pregnancy and delivery of both our kids, and we are really happy with her support.",

We had so many doubts and questions. She answered those so well, provided guidance on how we should approach henceforth. Based on that experience, we decided to consult Dr. Deepthi through this entire journey, though her clinic was very far from our home.\n   Dr. Deepthi is very kind, approachable and listens to our problems carefully. Being first pregnancy, we were bit anxious. However, during every visit she helped us understand that everything is normal and there is nothing to worry. \n   We never had to wait at the clinic, doctor was always available at the time of apppoitment. She also gave her personal number and provided guidance on phone whenever we required. She never prescribed unnecessary medicines, tests or scans. She advised to focus on diet and exercises.\n \n   Her clinic, First Care Clinic also is very well maintained, very clean, ventilated and we always felt at home, thanks to courteous staff, special mention of Nivedita. She helped us with appointments and any support required during visit. During COVID they took all the necessary precautions, so we were never worried about health safety.\n   Luckily for us, Dr. Deepthi started pregnancy scan facility in the clinic and it was truly great experience, we did all our scans post that in First Care Clinic itself. Doctor explained the scan results in details.\n\n   Dr. Deepthi always emphasized on importance of natural delivery. Her assesment of the expected delivery time was so accurate. \n   After getting admitted in the hospital, she regularly visited to check my condition.  There as well, she didn't go for unnecessary medication and kept giving confidence for normal delivery. \nFinally, we were blessed with healthy baby girl through natural delivery. Heartiest thanks to Dr. Deepthi for all her special efforts.\n\n   To find a doctor who cares for you, whom you can trust and for whom your health is paramount is very difficult these days. Dr. Deepthi is one such doctor, so highly recommend her for this special phase in our lives. \n   For last 9 months or so our life revolved around consultations with Dr. Deepthi, we always looked forward to next visit to the clinic. And I'm sure, we will continue to visit Dr. Deepthi in future for medical guidance and otherwise too. \n\nThank you very much Dr. Deepthi...!",

This is my journey with ma'am and her team :)\n\nWe started consulting Dr. Deepthi ma'am from my PCOD days and the first time we met ma'am, both my husband and me were convinced that she will be our gyno going forward. Ma'am prescribes medicines only if absolutely necessary and encouraged and educated about making lifestyle changes. Her strength is the way she cares and counsels her patients. \n\nContinued our journey with ma'am in our pregnancy days as well. Believe me I used to look forward to visiting the clinic and talk to ma'am. She has different aura that you cannot miss :) She answered every question we had and always explained the bed course of action clearly. From day one she encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle in order to have a healthy delivery. Ma'am was reachable everytime we needed. During the labour as well, she was my biggest motivator to go for normal delivery and helped in every single way to have a successful normal delivery. She made sure to check on me multiple times even when I was in hospital. Heartfelt gratitude to ma'am and Dr. Deepthi ma'am you will forever be special in my life! :)\n\nI would like to mention one more person who is also an important person in First care clinic. Ms. Niveditha in the front desk, who greets everybody with a smile and is always such a jovial person. We soon became very good friends. Her service is highly appreciated. \n\nClinic is very hygienic and well maintained. Also located in prime location. The in-house scanning facility, NST facility is something that helped me greatly and didn't have to move around during pregnancy. \n\nBoth my husband and me have already referred Dr. Deepthi ma'am to all our friends and she is now a family doctor and we will continue to refer her to everybody we know going forward as well.\n\nAs you can see, the review is long but words are short for the gratitude we have towards Deepthi ma'am and her team :)",

Her excellent diagnostic skills coupled with her intelligence & razor sharp eye for details enables her to reach the crux of the problem efficiently, leaving no stone unturned. She takes well - informed tenacious decisions, keeping the holistic well-being of the patients in mind. Being an epitome of patience, Dr. Deepthi avidly listens to her patients and comforts them by clearly explaining the situation and problem. She is immensely dedicated and driven by her passion to do the best for her patients. She is a light - hearted, very friendly and approachable person.\n\nFrom the first-time visit, till the time of delivery, we have had a wonderful experience consulting with Dr. Deepthi. We immediately felt being in comfort zone and received apt guidance at every stage. Since this was our first pregnancy, we were quite anxious and had a lot of questions during each of our visits. Dr. Deepthi very patiently explained everything to us, which helped us gain immense trust and belief. During the challenging phases of pregnancy, she was very pre-cautious, supported by giving us confidence and guided us in taking the best decisions. In the course of 9 months, we always looked forward to each of our very many visits and consultations.\nThe entire staff at First Care clinic was very friendly, with a positive attitude, making our experience all the more memorable. The clinic itself is well maintained.\n\nThe entire delivery was extremely well taken care of. My wife was admitted to the hospital for delivery on Dec 31st. Leaving aside the fact that it was New Year's Eve, Dr. Deepthi was there for us at all the important stages. Considering my wife's situation, Dr. Deepthi suggested for normal delivery and took the perfect decisions at every step, which helped in very good labour progression. By morning, we were blessed with a baby boy via normal delivery, by God's Grace.\nIt's extremely difficult to find a humane and humble doctor like Dr. Deepthi, who is truly a gem of a person. She always had our best interests in mind. Our entire experience of pregnancy and delivery was all the more special, thanks to Dr. Deepthi.\nWe are truly indebted and express our profound gratitude - Thank You Dr. Deepthi for everything!\n",

As I had some health concerns, we were very cautious and were looking for a doctor whom we can trust completely during the pregnancy phase.I was referred to Dr. Deepthi by few of my friends and hence consulted her for my pregnancy.Dr. Deepthi gives ample time to her patients, she answered all my questions in great detail and with tremendous patience. I had slight complications for the first 5 months of pregnancy and Dr. Deepthi helped me sail through this phase with her perfect treatment.She is very friendly, polite, caring and was available when you need her, she was just a phone call away.  She also gave her personal number and provided guidance on phone whenever we required. She always instilled confidence in me when I was low and used to get motherly feeling from her, after speaking to her. I felt I am in safe hands due to her knowledge, professionalism and great smile!It was worth consulting her even though First Care Clinic is far from our house. I was looking forward for my next visit to the clinic during my pregnancy.First Care Clinic is well maintained with pharmacy, laboratory, scanning facilities. The staff at First Care Clinic are very courteous, special mention to Niveditha(receptionist).I highly recommend Dr. Deepthi to anyone looking for a superior gynaecologist due to her pleasant, calm and supportive nature and Yes of couse her medical skills!Heartiest thanks to you Deepthi mam, for taking such good care of me from my initial days of pregnancy until delivery of our little bundle of joy!",

We consulted couple of doctors only to become the victims of rudeness,unsolicited discussions and especially \"the so called very senior doctors\" unable to understand or listen to the new age problems related to work, stress. \n\nWe are happy to share now ,that , we are proud parents of a little baby girl , who is our angel ,changing our worlds with positivism and being an inspiration for our family. \n\nIt would not have been possible without the doctor's utmost dedication ,due diligence and professional attitude in the complete process, given our circumstances and situation. During the initial consultation after visiting other doctors, we got the same / similar answers, but, the way Dr.Deepthi Shashidhar interacted and presented the options to us.It couldn't have been any better ,which helped in building the trust and faith to continue future consultations.\n\nThis doctor has the best combination of giving options where it doesn't need emphasis, And, taking leadership where it matters. (Ex: For routine blood tests/reports , we went ahead with a pathology lab near to our house - she was supportive as compared to other doctors, with whom, we have had experiences of their own lab recommendation.\n\nAnd, When it was a specific/complex test involved, she insisted on a clinic which was non-negotiable and the best. Even, the date of delivery had to be pre-poned due to tachycardia of mother and the baby - both of them are doing fine now due to the timely decision) . The entire pregnancy process was very clear and transperant, we had the right amount of information at all phases.\n\nWe are in the process of post pregnancy follow-ups and we share our gratitude in the counselling / support given by the doctor to my wife during the entire pregnancy cycle and are absolutely appreciative on the degree the professionalism in responding to our queries.",

Then we visited to Dr. Deepthi which was altogether different experience. She is very calm and handles every situation in a composed manner. She explains everything in detail. She prescribed few medicines initially and asked us to try naturally. We tried for few months but when I did not conceived, we went for ovulation induction. She gave us option to either try naturally or opt for IUI, in addition to ovulation induction. Good thing about Dr. Deepthi is that she does not imposes anything. She explains all the options in detail and suggests the better option but does not impose anything. We wanted to conceive as soon as possible, so we went for IUI, although doctor gave us option to try naturally with ovulation induction. With ovulation induction and IUI we conceived on very first month. As it was our first pregnancy we had hundreds of questions which doctor answered everytime with utmost patience and details. At the end of third month we went through a scary situation when I started bleeding. It was most difficult time of our life. There was risk of losing the pregnancy but the way doctor handled the whole situation we can never forget that. Coming to present I delivered a healthy baby that also through normal delivery, thanks to the doctor. She tries for normal delivery till the very end unless there are complications. Doctor had given her personal number and is very approachable. The most we liked about the doctor is her friendly nature, her calmness in difficult situations and the details in which she explains things. ",

Yes ! I know,Normal delivery is not common nowadays.  All thanks to my Dr Deepthi Shashidhar, her commitment and right decision making skills. \nEver since I was positive in my pregnancy tests, I am consulting in First Care Clinic. Proper diagnosis,  medication and guidance is something you can always expect.\nDr. Deepthi always spend ample time in clearing all queries,  concerns and proper required advices.

Not just during pregnancy, post pregnancy also she have provided complete care till I was recovered.\nIf you are looking for a doctor with whom you want to talk without any hesitation in clarifying your problems,  need proper care and **** services you CAN rely on First Care Clinic  and Dr. Deepthi.  \nRemember, Never judge a book by its cover !!\nSo, Instead of going directly to any big hospitals by advertisements go to First Care Clinic which can provide value for your money!!\nAlso, you will get choice to have delivery done either in Apollo Cradle Jayanagar or in Dr. Malathy Manipal hospital, Jayanagar.\nMe and my family is completely happy and thankful  with the services we have received. \n\nThank God for such a good Doctor\ud83d\ude4f",

Dr. Deepti ma'm is very friendly and used to be very calm during the visit. She used to clear our doubts very neatly. She never gave any unnecessary scans and medications. Anyone can follow her instructions and suggestions blindly without thinking twice. She gave her personal number and said that don't hesitate to call whenever needed. I liked that as many won't give their personal number to patients. And most important I used to be very happy after visiting her for checkups everytime by clearing all my doubts and by listening to her advices. I really appreciate her for her patience. Even after attending so many patients she always used to be very cool and calm and always smiling which made me feel comfortable. Initially my family members told search for other doctor nearby as the clinic was little far from my home and in my area many hospitals and clinics are there. But as we were very much satisfied with her treatment we never felt to change. By 2nd month I had faced some pregnancy issue and she gave a proper medication on the right time and resolved very soon. For me she tried alot for normal delivery. But due to some issue we had to go for c-section. she had waited from 3pm to 10.30pm and then she explained the situation and the issue with my husband and family very clearly and asked for their opinion. Finally I delivered a healthy baby girl on 26th Jan 2020 by 10.56pm\ud83e\udd17. Myself my husband and all my family members are very happy with her treatment. We all want to thank Deepti ma'm. I strongly recommend Deepti ma'm for pregnancy checkups or any pregnancy related issues. Thank you so much ma'm for making me enjoy my pregnancy period. ( We definitely will come to you only for our next baby as well ma'm\ud83d\ude1c)",

Indeed the best Gynaecologist in Bangalore. That humble friendly behaviour, she always guided me with the right diet, exercises, and irrespective of me being that super duper excited mom to be, she handled all my questions and queries with almost gentleness. I followed everything that she suggested me, and trust me when I say everything she says works just right, because she examines your body and then suggests stuffs that work best for you. I have never ever met a gynaecologist who actually invests so much time into her patients,their mental well being. She helped me deliver my BabyGirl just 18days ago, and I\u2019m so thankful to her. I would recommend her to everyone who is like me, like if it\u2019s your 1st pregnancy, or if you are one of those overly curious souls because she is the only one who can understand your mental state and suggest you the right things to do. The clinic also is so very well maintained, the staff is really friendly, it\u2019s so hygienic, all tests n scans are done in the clinic itself, and ma\u2019am always makes sure she meets the patient after each test n scan, to help the patient under their state better.

Had liver cholestasis and preterm labour pain, but she helped us with necessary treatment so I don\u2019t have preterm delivery and suggested c-section in my case and had successful delivery once I completed 37weeks. She even shared her personal contact and always answered any queries we had even after pregnancy completion. Really appreciate the detailed conversation that mam has and never hesitate to answer any question. Also want to mention receptionist Niveditha who is always prompt and manages things nicely. Even radiologist does the scan very patiently and answer any queries and explained everything at the end of every scan. Choosing Dr. Deepthi and First care clinic for our journey was one of the best decision we made. ",

The decision to consult her regarding early pregnancy symptoms was made by my wife and I in January 2022. Like most expectant parents, we were clueless and hadn't have that parental instinct then. When multiple fibroids and early bleeding were discovered in her initial scan, panic arose. Despite of our fears, she kept her cool and gave us confidence. With each visit to her clinic, our happiness and sense of confidence grew. She is constantly available and very friendly. Even in the middle of the night, the doctor was on the other end of the phone to allay our fears.\n\nDuring the fifth month of the pregnancy my wife had to relocate to a rural part of Karnataka since her job demanded it. Dr Deepthi motivated us to take the opportunity and even in the far-off village, her online consultation service gave us the confidence to carry on.\n\n\nFinally, on October 14, 2022, our baby was born into the hands of Dr. Deepthi at Apollo Cradle and I witnessed it along side of my wife and we felt ineffable joy at the sight of our daughter's first cry.\n\nThanks doctor for the great service and my family highly recommends Dr Deepthi and her team to all expectant parents.\n\nGod Bless!!!",

I visited several doctors but was concerned because of the contraints that each and everyone put forward right on the first visit e.g. One of the doctor told me that in case of emergency directly go to xyz hospital and not to call her, hospital people will directly co-ordinate with the doctor. After lot of browsing I came across Dr Deepthi via Practo. The feedback was very promising.Over the period of last 8 months when I have known her I found all the comments mentioned in the feedback section to be correct. There were minimal tests performed, minimal medicine prescribed (mostly harmless like pro biotics etc), no fuss created over any abnormalities in the test results (my wife was Rh -ve and her Hb went pretty low) and the doctor was available 27x7 on phone.For the tests she was never adamant on a specific lab as I always got those done from several, for blood she asked me if I want to arrange the donor or would like her help etc. There were lot many such instances.Another example which shows the level of professionalism of Dr Deepthi is I bought a package from Apollo Cradle for by childs birth. The package contained doctors consultation charges plus one follow up visit charges but Dr Deepthi visited twice a day everyday during the period my wife was admitted in the hospital and did not charge an additional penny. I would like to thank her and would strongly recommend her.",

Firstly We like to thank you for taking care of us and making our first pregnancy experience smoother and enjoyable.\nLast week of October we are Blessed with a Baby Girl (Our first child) at Manipal Hospital, under Deepthi Mam's Supervision, Normal Delivery! Throughout pre and post-pregnancy we are going through many things, especially the mental one due to Pandemic. For that our panic level was raised, what to do and don'ts for both. As we don't have any prior Gynaecologist experience whatsoever! Thanks to Deepthi Mam, we are blessed to have her. We got endless MENTAL SUPPORT, she is very PATIENT in LISTENING AND gives you the BEST DIAGNOSIS, MEDICATION, and best LABOUR ROOM EXPERIENCE. Also, we called her many times, and she was always available on phone without hesitation whenever we needed it.\nAlso, post-pregnancy, she provided complete guidance. \nIt's a great experience at Dr. Deepthi Mam and clinic, for an appointment, rescheduling, or any assistance worth it.\nAgain Me and my family will be always thankful to you Mam. \n*** *** *** **** ******* **** ** \nRajshekhar, Kuheli and Shreenika",

I am very happy about the way i was guided and hence, writing this review.\n\n Health issue- I had a bad experience with my 1st pregnancy. I was 10 weeks pregnant when I had to abort my child because of no growth. It was a Sunday morning & all of a sudden, I started bleeding. I tried to reach my doctor (Dr X whom I was consulting during that time). But the Dr. was not available on Sunday. My condition was getting bad. It was then my hubby googled out for the available Dr on Sunday & fortunately we found Deepthi Mam who guided & helped us in the entire missed abortion process. She was there with us till late until we were in a comfortable position. Though it was a bad day which we don't want to remember, however we would like to thank Dr Deepthi for the much needed support.\n\nFrom then onwards, I continued to consult Dr Deepthi. She prescribed only basic medicines & exercises and it is under her supervision that we are blessed with our little Princess. Dr. Deepthi made the entire pregnancy process very smooth. During our each visit, she used to listen to our doubts patiently and clarify them with all smiles on her face.  She never prescribed unnecessary medications and tests. She was very supportive, humble and was available 24*7. \n\nWe would like to thank Dr Deepthi for all her support and would highly recommend her.",

She is humble, She explains things so that anybody can understand. She will listen to all your queries and answer them with a smile.  \n\nLater my wife got conceived within a month of visit and from then on we started visiting Dr.Deepthi regularly, Each time visit simply made our experience with Doctor more heart whelming. We used to have so many questions during every visits, She patiently used to listen to them and answer them one by one, She always referred the meds only which are needed and no unnecessary things. \n\nMy wife delivered a Baby Boy under Dr.Deepthi's supervision. Our entire pregnancy journey was smooth and enjoyable because of Dr.Deepthi. \nThank you mam and Keep up the good work. ",

Given that both of us are not in the early child bearing age group, we had our own apprehensions of treading the bold step taken, more so because of the long gap from the first pregnancy. \nThe counselling by Dr.Deepthi was very convincing and helped us make informed decisions at every stage in the pregnancy. The doctor's expertise in handling high risk cases was very much evident from her methodical approach, in thoroughly understanding the patient's history, and thereby devise the treatment as is deemed necessary. She was very approachable and explained all the doubts that we had in mind, given our earlier experiences from first pregnancy. \nInfact the doctor used to proactively follow up and get periodical observations/test results, to avoid any delay in treatment. There were instances where the doctor took the initiative herself in getting appointments from renowned radiologist to make quick and informed decisions. \nThe doctor visited us often from the time my wife got admitted in hospital and was around during labour as well, assuring us that the right care was being provided to her at all times. Even though my wife underwent a high risk pregnancy, the doctor vouched for normal delivery, without coaxing us for other options, and tried whatever was best and appropriate for that moment.\nMy heartfelt gratitude to Dr.Deepthi and thank her profusely for guiding us all through the journey of becoming parents once again. \nNeed to make a mention of First Care Clinic as well, which is well maintained and has in-house scanning and lab test facility. There is no need to travel different places in order to take ultrasound/lab tests. The front desk staffs are equally commendable for the service provided thus making the memories last a life time. \nGoing further, I will definitely recommend Dr.Deepthi RK Shashidhar to whomever we know and are seeking for guidance.

When we met her first, she told us all the required information like what stage pregnancy is in, precautions to be taken and foods to eat n avoid to carry it further and avoid miscarriage in first trimester.\n\nFrom then there is no looking back. We decided to continue with her as we felt the trust and faith in her.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, she guided us and took right decission at right time, such as making sure to get hemoglobin shots when it was low and keep guiding about weight gain and tips to have normal delivery.\nShe never prescribed unnecessary medications and nrver forced us about any unnecessary tests if something can be achieved through diet changes.\n\nDuring my delivery, she gave me confidence to try for vaginal delivery even guided duty doctors through phone constantly to go for less riskier and medicated route since i was induced. I opted for c sec after 15hrs of labour when it dint progress and was in hospital for 7 days due to baby having jaundice, she was constantly in touch with me and duty nurses and doc and visited me everyday.\n\nShe was just a call away. Even after delivery when I use to ping her in WhatsApp for some queries she has helped without thinking i am not her client or patient anymore.\n\nChoosing her is the best decission we made.\nFirst care clinic is also handled nicely. Have to mention Nivedita who promptly handles all appointments, we never waited more than 15 min for 9 months. Even the radiologist does the scan with utmost patience, checks thoroughly and answers all our queries during scan. \nOverall first care clinic and Dr.Deepti made us feel at home and confidant throughout the pregnancy which i am truly grateful to. I have referred them to my friends and families and i am definitely going for second pregnancy to her.",

From the core of my heart thanks a lot doctor for being with us throughout this difficult journey. Dr. Deepthi took my case when most of the doctors from exclusive maternity hospitals denied to treat her. My wife became COVID positive when she was at her seven month. She was admitted for 8 days for theCOVID treatment.I must mention here Dr. Deepthi was so generous and approachable, though my wife was admitted in different hospital under different doctor, for each and every medicine what was given to my wife for COVID treatment I used  to ping her personal number to check if those medicines are safe for maternity or not and every time I got a reply. sometimes I felt guilty to get the medical assistance without consultation charges but she never ever thought beyond her patient and her treatment. Sorry mam for disturbing you a lot. Once my wife became negative we continued the journey with Dr. Deepthi. In our case there was an issue of premature placenta. At 36 week placenta was 8.3cm, still doctor never asked for C-section.  Till the end she tried for normal delivery. But at mid of 37th week again we faced some complications regarding baby movements. I just went for check up to her and she asked us to get admitted. I am really thankful about her right decision at right moment and we are blessed with a healthy baby boy and well doing mommy. I must say my son blessed with a doctor like Dr. Deepthi. I strongly recommend her though you are from any corner of Bangalore. Thanks is a very small word for all the help. All my good wishes are with you Mam.",

Doctor is always calm, friendly, answers all doubts perfectly.She always welcomes her patients with a smile and there is no much waiting time in her clinic for regular checkups or scans too. The facility at the clinic is great and it is very well maintained. The staff here are very friendly as well. I am blessed with a baby girl on 25th December 2022 and very thankful to the Doctor to play a major role in my wonderful pregnancy phase.",

She was not clearly telling how she is going to proceed with the treatment. She just told us to get an ultrasound which she also does herself but as I was not comfortable, I decided to not continue with her for my treatment. One of the rudest doctor I have ever met.

After our first visit, we continued to go for regular checkups. In 3rd month of pregnancy my wife started vomiting continuously. We have contacted Dr.Deepthi through video consultation and she advised us to come to Hospital immediately. She has given one injection to my wife and vomiting stopped after that.

She comes across as very calming, approachable and knowledgeable and is a go-to doctor for every gynaecology & obstetrics related issue. As a first time pregnant mother-to-be, there were lots of confusions and doubts. She sorted all our queries and suggested us the best course of action. Don't lose hope if you don't get her on whatsapp and call in the initial stages, she will share her number when you really have some complications and when required. My overall pregnancy journey was hassle free because of right guidance from Dr Deepthi. I am now a proud mother of a little angel that is my daughter. During covid times, having a responsible & experienced doctor was very important and we had one!! Thank you Dr. Deepthi for all the advice, help and support :)",

When we met Dr Deepthi we were pretty confident from the first consultation itself that we are in the right hands. These 9 months are definitely not easy and it has almost been a roller coaster with so many ups and downs . We used to panic and would get depressed at times and that is when the immense support from the doctor made us feel most comfortable. So our overall experience has been very good as we have always got all the care, attention and proper treatment at all time.\n\nEven though in this tough situation of pandemic, Dr Deepthi availabity was apprectiable, rememberable and her guidlines was awesome and highly recommendable.

She is very professional clear with treatment and scans most importantly very much ethical and transparent . Best part is she explains the technical terms and medical conditions in the lucid terms. She took extra care and all the precautions during the delivery. She always tries her best for a normal delivery but ultimately takes decision in the best interest of the mother and child. You can trust her skills and wisdom and blindly follow her prescription like we did. Lastly you can be assured that she will be always there for you. Once again thank you doctor",

In a very first interaction with her, I really impressed with the way she treats me, the way she explains the treatment plan for me. She explained things nicely,  also advised things to be avoided for a successful pregnancy. She is really a very good doctor, so kind, so soft with the patient, ****** ** *** ****** having tremendous experience to handle multiple gyne related disease at one time.\nVery important thing which I would like to suggest to those who wants normal delivery, kindly consult Dr Deepthi, I m sure, she will try till last extent to deliver in a normal and natural way as she did in my case.\nI m really very grateful to her.\nThanks \n",

She was always available over call. With her guidance I delivered healthy baby on March 03. Till last moment she tried for normal delivery with high patience. But due to certain factors she took immediate wise decision of c-section. After delivery she guided me very well regarding breastfeeding and she is always available in case of any problems even through calls.As I left for my hometown after delivery she suggested me medicine via whatsapp and video calls for the infection I had developed and we always felt we are in safe hands\ud83d\ude0a. She has deep knowledge and is experienced. What more can you expect from good doctor!! We are very happy with the experience and highly recommend her for anyone looking for best gynaecologist and obstetrician. Thank you madam for making our pregnancy journey smooth and happy.",

My whole world turned upside down , we were terrified and didnt know what to do next. Doctor deepthi was extremely supportive during this time too. She was continuously in touch with us and always encouraged us with positive thoughts. She was like an angel in my life who have made our 2020 memorable. \nThank you doctor for your extreme support.",

She was available for us and responded aptly for doubts and questions round the clock. She rushed to attend to my wife's complications thrice in 09 months, late in the night around 11.45 pm, 11 pm and 03 am without hesitation or delay. \n\nDuring pregnancy, we had to go in for a Cervical Cerclage and doctor was very supportive and did not advise unnecessary medications or scans. \n\n Today, we have a healthy baby girl and still Dr. Deepthi is treating my wife for her post partum wellness. We couldn't thank her much for her patience, kindness and commitment. \n\nWe would definitely recommend Dr. Deepthi for her non-commercial mindset and for patients who would want to avoid unnecessary medications, scans, tests, or visits to hospital.\nChidananda and Shwetha.",

Doctor is not Money oriented and the consultation and revisiting fees is also very less compared to other doctors. The treatment and medicines she provides are also very good. We highly recommend dr.

I examined you to rule out yeast infection as you said you had itching after asking you  ,you also mentioned about your pre existing condition only after asking you. I also told you that chances of recurrent yeast infection is more common as you have a pre existing condition, you also agreed that you had similar episodes earlier . I treated you for 2 infections for uti and yeast infection to relieve your symptoms . You did not even do the test nor took medication and wrote a feedback the next morning. If you were not affordable I would have given some  physician samples at least . I really don\u2019t understand why people go to a doctor if they don\u2019t want to follow what the doctor says . Giving bad feedback for cost of drugs doesn\u2019t make sense .",

She was very patient throughout the pregnancy to clarify in depth and detail any doubts we had. She was accessible through her personal WhatsApp number at all times and her counselling guidance helped me manage the ups and downs during my pregnancy. I'm overjoyed that she was my gynec and provided all the necessary support a woman needs during pregnancy. I would strongly recommend her if you need proper medication, guidance and counselling through your pregnancy journey. ",

May be for this kind of health issue its not required to do BP check up and other things, However her consultation was good and will see after medication how my mother will recover.",

Infertility in a couple is a very painful and sensitive issue , evaluating infertility and getting to know how to treat a couple requires lot of information about very sensitive intricate details of the couple which may be very unpleasing to hear like wether a couple is sexually active if there is any vaginismus or ED , so that we can plan ART  to get the couple pregnant, we ask these questions not to hurt any one ,but to know how to go about the treatment, sorry if you have misinterpreted my intentions , but history taking is not to hurt anybody. Would like to advise u to go as a couple to any doctor so that you and partner will be evaluated properly and get the right treatment for right outcome.",
