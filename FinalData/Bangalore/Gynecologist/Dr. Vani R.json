Please find my review : \n\n1) A lot of positiveness in the treatment . \n2) No unnecessary treatment or medications suggested , but all necessary tests were done and taken care . \n3) During covid and non COVID I would suggest this doctor\u2019s clinic , as all tests , growth scans , medicines provided were done at the same place, need not travel several places , whereas other clinics I have seen this issue . \n4) Any time Dr Vani is available to attend your concerns , just whats App her . \n5) I had a normal delivery , with all her support and guidance. No hurry in delivering . \n6) Did suggest me the best things during my pregnancy , she was my second mom during my pregnancy as my mom was in US for my initial pregnancy months . \n7) Dr Vani does not fear you out with any health issues if you have any \u2026, whereas other few doctors I have seen and heard they really fear you out. \n8) I personally was in search of a friendly gynaecologist, which I saw in Dr Vani , very soft spoken. This really matters as your hormones would be changing during pregnancy .  I had bad experience earlier with other gynaecologist who was rude.\n\nWhen my pregnancy was detected , just saw her commendable experience and reviews of others through Practo and did visit her and indeed was the best decision of my life . Her visit timings were very comfortable for a working women . During delivery , she was in constant contact with OT doctors and guiding them the necessary steps .  My smooth pregnancy and delivery  credit goes to the doctor .\n",

I made sure I was fully cured before visiting the hospital.She never prescribed any unnecessary tests or medication. All the necessary medications, blood tests, scans were taken care on time.I was always worried about each and everything, but Dr.Vani's words made me calm. She is very cool and confident.After going thru all the physical and mental stress because of covid during pregnancy, finding Dr.Vani was a relief to us. I was not able to go thru normal delivery this time due to some medical reason. And this was a planned c-section and Dr.Vani handled it so well. She is accessible thru WhatsApp for any clarification about the tests and  reports.She answered all my doubts and queries in every visit.I delivered in the last week of December. Our family is always greatful to Dr.Vani for bringing our little princess into this world safely.Thank you doctor :) ",

Please find my review : \n\n1) A lot of positiveness in the treatment . \n2) No unnecessary treatment or medications suggested , but all necessary tests were done and taken care . \n3) During covid and non COVID I would suggest this doctor\u2019s clinic , as all tests , growth scans , medicines provided were done at the same place, need not travel several places , whereas other clinics I have seen this issue . \n4) Any time Dr Vani is available to attend your concerns , just whats App her . \n5) I had a normal delivery , with all her support and guidance. No hurry in delivering . \n6) Did suggest me the best things during my pregnancy , she was my second mom during my pregnancy as my mom was in US for my initial pregnancy months . \n7) Dr Vani does not fear you out with any health issues if you have any \u2026, whereas other few doctors I have seen and heard they really fear you out. \n8) I personally was in search of a friendly gynaecologist, which I saw in Dr Vani , very soft spoken. This really matters as your hormones would be changing during pregnancy .  I had bad experience earlier with other gynaecologist who was rude.\n\nWhen my pregnancy was detected , just saw her commendable experience and reviews of others through Practo and did visit her and indeed was the best decision of my life . Her visit timings were very comfortable for a working women . During delivery , she was in constant contact with OT doctors and guiding them the necessary steps .  My smooth pregnancy and delivery  credit goes to the doctor .\n",

I made sure I was fully cured before visiting the hospital.She never prescribed any unnecessary tests or medication. All the necessary medications, blood tests, scans were taken care on time.I was always worried about each and everything, but Dr.Vani's words made me calm. She is very cool and confident.After going thru all the physical and mental stress because of covid during pregnancy, finding Dr.Vani was a relief to us. I was not able to go thru normal delivery this time due to some medical reason. And this was a planned c-section and Dr.Vani handled it so well. She is accessible thru WhatsApp for any clarification about the tests and  reports.She answered all my doubts and queries in every visit.I delivered in the last week of December. Our family is always greatful to Dr.Vani for bringing our little princess into this world safely.Thank you doctor :) ",

She takes effort to put the patient at ease and explains in detail in simple language. She is very reachable. I always felt I was talking to a very knowledgeable and caring friend rather than a doctor. We are very happy that we got to know Dr. Vani. We are now blessed with a healthy baby boy! and we give credit to Dr. Vani for the way she managed my pregnancy.

Other than this, she is perfect and dedicated one. I would extent my heart full of gratitude for letting me complete my pregnancy in d midst of covid.

I trust her judgment, and would recommend her to all moms-to-be looking for a good obstetrician around Banashankari, especially if you have had a gynec history such as a myomectomy or laparoscopy.",

We are forever thankful for excellent treatment, care and the way Dr owns the patient is commendable, despite some huddles. Dr was available 24/7 for any query, some were silly though.

I was more keen on a normal delivery as I did not have much complications, doctor was very supportive and encouraging.\nDoctor waited post due date so that she can try normal delivery inspite of knowing that the baby was big. Had to undergo c section in last min due to various reasons. But what I appreciate is Doctor did not force her opinions on me and allowed me to decide on what I want till the end. She went for c section only after there was no other choice left.\n\nShe\u2019s funny, polite, ************* *** *********** ******* She followed all the procedures perfectly and road to recovery was smooth.\nThank you Doctor for helping us to bring our bundle of joy to this world!!
