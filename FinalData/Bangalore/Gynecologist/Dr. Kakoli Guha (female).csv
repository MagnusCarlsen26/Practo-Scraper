,,0,0,YES,"Subject: My Amazing Experience with Dr. Kakoli Guha: The Friendliest OB-GYN Ever!

So, let me tell you about Dr. Kakoli Guha – the absolute best OB-GYN out there! When I found out I was pregnant with my first kid, I was a mix of excited and nervous, you know? But the moment I met Dr. Guha, all those nerves went out the window.

Her office wasn't just a waiting room; it was like a safe haven. Everyone, from the receptionist to the nurses, made you feel like you were among friends. And Dr. Guha? She was like a beacon of friendliness and warmth.

Once, during my second trimester, I freaked out over some weird symptom late at night. I thought I'd leave a message, but guess what? Dr. Guha answered the phone herself! She listened, asked questions, and calmed me down. Having a doctor who's there for you, even after hours, meant the world to me.

As my due date got closer, I realized Dr. Guha wasn't just good at her job – she was amazing. Every checkup felt like a chat with a knowledgeable friend. She explained things without making me feel uninformed, and her genuine concern for my well-being was pretty darn comforting.

When it came to the big day – the delivery – Dr. Guha was a rockstar. Labor is intense, right? But her encouraging words and calm vibe turned the delivery room into a positive space. It wasn't just about the medical stuff; it was personal.

Looking back, I'm so grateful for Dr. Guha's friendliness. She's not just a doctor; she's like that friend you can count on. I'll never forget the support she gave me, and I feel lucky to have had her by my side. Dr. Guha isn't just delivering babies; she's delivering genuine care and friendship. She's the real deal!",2023-12-06 14:32:41,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
