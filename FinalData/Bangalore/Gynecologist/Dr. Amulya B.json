Hence, checked reviews on her and nobody given any reviews to her. I\u2019m Pregnant and it\u2019s second baby which was tested at home. \nWhen we visit gynaecologist, they will first confirm about the pregnancy and then prescribe medicine and TT injection. But, Dr. Amulya didn\u2019t even touched me nor tested to get confirmation about my pregnancy. Directly prescribed medicine and TT injection to take. And one comment what she said \u201c I feel your blood is good\u201d not even 5minutes that consultation went. We waited for her of 30 to 35 minutes irrespective of appointment time. It was really disappointment for me. I suggest to check the reviews of doctor instead of their experience that doesn\u2019t matter. ",
