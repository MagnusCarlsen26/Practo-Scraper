"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Labor and Delivery,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Hi

I was consulting Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi mam in cloudnine Whitefield branch for my pregnancy.i am a first time mother. and my whole experience of pregnancy and delivery is so awesome with Rajyalakshmi mam and cloudnine hospital.

She listens so patient fully to all your questions and queries. No matter how long your list is. She carries a big smile in her face everytime i visit.which gave me  a positive vibe always. I remember some consultations i entered with a big tensed head and came out with a big smile on my face. Never waited long to meet her during the consultations.

She explained me everything in detail regarding delivery and all. She is always focused on normal delivery.my baby's head was not in down position upto 38 weeks.she waited till 39 week by saying it will change. And yes it did. Unfortunately the water level was decreased and i got admitted on the last day of my 39 weeks for the delivery. She tried almost 16 hours for normal delivery.but my body didn't respond well to the induction process and some emergency situation occurred like my baby had done poop inside( i was having continuous cough and nose blockage but no medicines were recommended at that time as it might hurt the delivery process) and i got a C-section.

Will share my experience inside the O.T too. As i was in labour pain I remember before giving anaesthesia to me Rajyalakshmi mam gave me confidence there too to keep calm and everything will be alright.i felt like my mother is beside me.and it made me so happy.after that i was so relaxed and yeah finally saw my baby girl.
ALL thanks to Dr. Rajyalakshmi mam for the proper guidance and treatment during my pregnancy. I am fully satisfied. Thank you mam.

Even she observed me post delivery too. Make me learnt some exercises. And in cloudnine hospital i got all the facilities (bill was high though) and the nurses and the other doctors were so helpful and friendly.

I will highly recommend Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi if you want to consult for your pregnancy or any gynic problem.i am sure you will get your solution with all satisfication.

Thank you",2020-06-19 14:39:06,False,True,Swagatika Tripathy,,,

The best thing is she never recommended any ""unnecessary"" tests and also recommended us the best place to get the tests done since Cloud Nine Whitefield Hospital at that time around 2 years ago was very new and didn't have all the facilities (now they have).
