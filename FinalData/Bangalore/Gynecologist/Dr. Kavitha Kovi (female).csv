Right from day one of consultation till the day of delivery, Kavitha ma‚Äôam had been a constant support and gave us the right guidance. She is readily available on her personal watsapp for small & big clarifications. Highly professional, skilled in her field & has vast experience which is oblivious the way she handles her patients. Also,doesn‚Äôt recommend unnecessary tests, scans,medicines & frequent consultations if everything seems normal to her which is uncommon these days. The great part is she doesn‚Äôt let you overthink about any situation or about future. And makes you believe that everything is progressing in a normal  way. Moreover encourages you to enjoy the pregnancy journey, do what you like & take it easy with all necessary precautions.

Our journey of birth was no less than a beautiful experience wherein i was not anticipating delivery at close to 37 weeks( 36+ 5 days).A day before my delivery we went to hospital after I experienced little brown discharge & pressure in lower abdomen. I was kept under supervision for few hours . All this time, she was aware of my condition through duty doctor & wanted everything to progress naturally. Also, made a visit in the end, explained the progress & was discharged same day. Following day, i had stronger contractions & passed blood filled mucus, and around the same time a day before, we made it to the hospital again after informing Kavitha Ma‚Äôam . Little did we know that i was in labour & dilated already. I was told that it‚Äôs just a matter of few hours for labour to progress. It was Sunday & Kavitha Ma‚Äôam came rushing at the right time for delivery. Although in her absence, her team managed & prepared us well for the express delivery but when she entered the room, i was relieved to the core & knew it‚Äôs going to be alright. Her presence in the room just gave me so much comfort in the midst of all contractions & pain. From reaching the hospital to delivering  a healthy baby boy vaginally with minimal intervention, it was just a matter of 2 hours. 

We are eternally grateful & thankful to Dr Kavitha ma‚Äôam for instilling the right kind of attitude & positivity that helped us sail through our pregnancy journey. Needless to say she is a POWERHOUSE and truly dedicated to her role as an OBGYN.

I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care you provided throughout my pregnancy journey and during the successful normal vaginal delivery of our healthy baby.

From our very first appointment [at 6 weeks], you instilled a sense of confidence and reassurance in both myself and my partner. 

During the delivery, your encouraging words and steady guidance were invaluable. Your expertise and quick decision-making ensured a smooth and safe delivery for both me and our baby. 

Your presence in the delivery room brought a sense of comfort and reassurance during what can be an overwhelming experience. Your dedication to your patients is truly commendable.

Thanks to your exceptional care, we are now blessed with a healthy baby, and we couldn't be more grateful. Your role in bringing our little one into the world will always be remembered with fondness and appreciation.

My journey:
Delivery pain was not started at home, we visited Aster Hospital, where pain was induced by Kavitha mam, and it was a 12-hour labor pain journey, out of which 8 to 9 hours journey was tolerable because of an epidural. The last 2 hours were a little hectic, but you feel it is worth, it once the baby is delivered and lying on you.

We are blessed with a baby boy. 

To all upcoming moms,
Congratulations on your pregnancy journey. Wishing you a good luck. Please have some patience for normal delivery and trust Kavitha mam and her well-trained team. 


To all upcoming dads,
You may find, out where is Dr. Kavitha mam during your wife's labor pain, but trust her, have some patience,  She is actively monitoring her patient through the duty doctor, and in between labor also, she will visit and provide encouraging words, She will definitely arrive at the right time for delivery of the baby.  She is very sensitive towards new moms.  



After delivering my baby, I can only say, I was in the safe hands of Kavitha Kovi. Wishing a good health for Kavitha's Mam. Once again, thank you, Dr. Kavitha Mam's team, for your outstanding care, expertise, and compassion. You have made a lasting impact on our lives, and we are forever grateful.

I hope this message finds you well. Before delving into my birth story, I wanted to express my sincerest gratitude for the exceptional care and support you provided during my pregnancy journey.

At 28 weeks pregnant, I encountered a significant challenge when diagnosed with a kidney stone. Despite initial treatment from both a urologist and a gynecologist at a prestigious multispecialty hospital, complications arose as I developed an infection around the stent placed in the ureter area. Despite their best efforts, the infection persisted, prompting me to seek a second opinion.

Thankfully, fate led me to your expertise at the Conceive clinic, where I met Dr. Kavitha Kovi. From the moment I walked into your clinic, I felt reassured by your confidence and dedication to resolving my medical issues. Your assurance in treating the kidney stone and removing the stent, coupled with your comprehensive approach and valuable references, instilled in me a newfound sense of hope.

Under your guidance, the kidney stone was successfully treated and removed by an experienced urologist, alleviating my concerns and paving the way for a smoother pregnancy journey. Throughout the remaining weeks of my pregnancy, your unwavering support and expertise ensured a sense of calm and confidence, which I will forever be grateful for.

Since then, I have been exclusively consulting Dr. Kavitha for my pregnancy. Under her guidance, the last few weeks of my pregnancy went smoothly, and I felt reassured by her expertise and dedication.

During delivery, my water broke at 11:20 PM, and I had a normal vaginal delivery at 11:35 PM the next day. Throughout the 24-hour period, Dr. Kavitha and her team managed everything efficiently. Despite moments of pain and my requests for a C-section, they continuously encouraged me to do breathing exercises. Their steadfast commitment to my well-being never wavered, ultimately resulting in a successful vaginal delivery of a healthy baby.

Words cannot adequately express my gratitude for the exceptional care you provided during such a pivotal moment in my life. Your patience, motivation, and unwavering support were invaluable, and I am forever grateful for the positive impact you've had on my pregnancy journey.

Thank you, once again, for your outstanding care and dedication.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"It was my 6th week when I saw that 2 pink lines on the test kit. It was a moment of joy for sure but this was my first child and like many of you who are going to be a first time mother, I had so many apprehensions and fears in my mind about how I am going to go through this. 

I did research on all the hospitals in Bangalore, read over hundreds of reviews and chose Dr. Kavitha Kovi for two primary reasons. As per the reviews, she was the kind of doctor who makes your life going through pregnancy much easier and she promotes natural delivery. 

I was very nervous visiting a gynaecologist imagining all sorts of do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs and all the medicine I would get prescribed and whether she will treat me with empathy. And the moment I entered her cabin, the sheer smile on her face and the calmness in her voice evaporated all my anxieties and I felt I am in the right place. And I was right. Dr. Kovi isn‚Äôt just a great gynaecologist but she is also a wonderful woman who is very ethical in her prescriptions and compassionate in her treatment. From that point on to the night in the delivery room when I was getting nervous with all the pain and was requesting for C-Section, she kept encouraging me to go for completely natural delivery. She even advised against inducing or applying suction. And she helped me normalise the pain with her encouraging words. During the entire pregnancy, she just kept me on Iron and Calcium and everytime I complained of experiencing pain or nausea or blackouts or a dozen other things, she patiently handled it and asked me to just go through it and assured me that it‚Äôs all normal and that I don‚Äôt need any medicines. 

Good Doctors prescribe right medicines, great doctors know that avoiding too many drugs is the right thing. 

I could go on and write pages about her but I have to say this in a nutshell. If you are an expecting mother and you have Dr. Kovi on your side, trust me you have the best care you can get.

I was 5 cms dilated when contractions began getting more frequent and unbearable. That is when I asked for an Epidural. I knew Epidural would help me to bear the pain till I'm fully dilated and save my energy for the pushing. After nearly 8 hours of labor, I was fully dilated .and my baby girl was out with 8-9 pushes.

Initially we started consulting with another gynaecologist in Whitefield, which turned out to be a very poor experience and all our doubts were not even heard by that doctor. She just wanted to finish as many patients as possible by giving 2-3 mins of time to each one. So to get a decent pregnancy care, we started consulting with Dr Kavitha in Aster hospital. 

In the first visit itself, we were so happy after the consultation. She listened to all our queries patiently and answered each one till we were full convinced. She even used notepad to draw/write and explain. She also had some printed set of documents with detailed Q&A which was also quite helpful and can be studied in our own time. 

Some of her unique traits are her friendliness, patience and definitely her knowledge and experience.  We felt like we created a bond during that pregnancy period.  Initially I was very worried whether the delivery would happen naturally or using C-section. She instilled that confidence in me and prepared me physically and mentally for delivering naturally. We followed religiously all her instructions and ended up delivering naturally toward the end of nine months.

Around the end of nine months, I received mild pain and then after checking with Dr Kavitha, I got admitted in Aster. She performed the delivery and we were blessed with a cute and healthy baby girl.  The efforts and clarity she provided during the delivery also very commendable. 

The effort Dr Kavitha puts for each of her patient is admirable. I wish her all the best in life and career and hope she will continue to bless many more couples who visits her and helps to bring more and more happy and healthy lives into this world. 

If you want an awesome experience during your delivery care, you should definitely visit Dr Kavitha. Her experience, knowledge, friendliness, care is unmatchable.  Visit to doctors has now a days has become so transactional but thanks to doctors like Dr Kavitha who still treats patience with utmost personal care and bonding.

One of other many traits that built our confidence in her was that unlike many other doctors, she had been very prompt over whatsapp to clear any doubt and handle any SOS condition.

Many doctors tell you what to do without listening to patients but Dr. Kavitha always listened carefully and explained why it's happening and what to do for it. During pregnancy an emergency can occur any time and Dr. gave her number on day 1 and freely asked to message if and when required. Even without messaging, just the confidence that I have the Dr's number calmed me down. Although she always replied to my queries within minutes. 
She always guided me to have an appropriate diet and exercise routine which made me stronger. She did dietary interventions whenever required which helped a lot to keep the parameters in check.
She is also updated on modern and upcoming medicines and techniques and embraces the technology along with the good old natural birthing practices. 

During the labor time also Dr was composed and clear with the instructions and helped me get through it.

I went to the Dr Kavitha Kovi after getting a positive on the kit, she calculated the weeks and performed heart beat scan. Things went positively, she congratulated us... after the NT scan I was identified with notches... I was 24 yrs and she did not neglect anything... Eye to details... Everything went noticed... She gave medicines for it and withdrew me from it after things were normal in anomaly scan... I was depressed one day and went to her as I felt restless... She counseled me, empathized and motivated me... 
I had premature pains on a day of strict karnataka bandh... I went to hospital very early in the morning.. doctors who tried to come to hospital we're stopped n their cars were broken... She instructed junior doctor n came to hospital in ambulance in such extreme situation, treated me... I was hospitalized for 2 days and pains came into control... After 4 weeks when I just entered into 9th month I delivered a baby boy... She tried her best for normal delivery... I was not obsessed with normal delivery but she never gave up.. I had to be shifted to OT on emergency as I was not able to push- I was given anaesthesia for C-section after going through labour pains (on epidural of course) but she gave a final try on vacuum and it was successful... Motivating young mothers no one can beat her... I take my son to the same hospital for check ups n vaccination... She has always been polite n greeted me n my family well... 
Such talented doctors are created by gods for mankind... I would always be thankful to her!
Hospitals n management might have some issues but one should not hold doctor responsible for it... 
I am writing this almost 2.5 yrs post delivery... People with neg feedbacks come forward but it is important for people with positive feedback to mention their experience here so that more people can benefit out of such talented doctors!

She is one of the most easy to talk to gynaecologists I have met. Doctor Kavitha comes with an open mind and a tone of friendliness to hear your concerns out and provide help in the best possible way.

I had past experience of anxiety and she was extremely understanding of the fact and even suggested continuing therapy unlike other doctors who discount the importance of mental health.

She was also supremely supportive throughout my tiresome labour and tried for vaginal delivery to the best that she could. We ended up going for a c section when she was a 100% sure vaginal delivery was not an option anymore.

Her availability on phone calls and WhatsApp messages was a big help as well. She is not someone who will push you to visit the hospital for smaller issues that don‚Äôt need her observation.

- when it comes to Delivery, she prefers NORMAL DELIVERY instead of C Section. (Personal experience, almost given up in the last hour, but she motivated and tried her best, finally it worked out very well.)

1. The doctor communicates well in a friendly manner. We feel a lot of care in her communication.

Dr Kavitha kovi was the Doctor for our first baby delivery. After our first experience with the Doctor, we recommended her service to our neighbours & friends. They were also happy with the treatment.

After 5 years, when we were considering a second baby, we searched her profile on the net & paper. Even though she was in a different hospital, we again consulted her for second delivery as well. 

Both the deliveries were safe & normal. You can see the TRUST & FAITH, we had on the Doctor.

Today, the healthcare industry plays an important role in our lives. We see many cases where the hospitals & Doctors misuse the patients' circumstances to their benefit!!  But, Dr Kavitha kovi is changing the wrong perception and giving us a good impression of Doctors.
