She wrote us many optional medicines and asked to have only and only if some problem happens like if u have frequent vomiting have this tab, one odd is fine. Second best thing i liked is that she gave us tests request which is required for next visit. Usually you will see that you visit the doc, she gives test and u visit again. Even before 1st visit, we had called her, she adviced not to come  come without ultrasound done else consultation would be of no use. We liked that approach as it same both our time and her time as well. ",2016-02-22 06:40:58,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
