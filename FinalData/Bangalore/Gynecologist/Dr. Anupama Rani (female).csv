I am not exaggerating when I say she is so knowledgaeble, kind, compassionate, patient all at the same time! She takes the time to address all concerns and questions, no matter how big or small they may seem. No rushed consultations. Every consultation, my husband and I walked out with so much clarity & content. Being an unplanned pregnancy and having conceived amidst multiple treks & off-roading, we had a lot of questions starting from day 1, and she did not shy away from debunking all myths and explaining things backed with reasons. She even draws on a paper to help us picturise and understand how it all works. And if at all we missed to ask something during consultation, she was available on whatsapp throughout. Cannot stress on the importance of having someone like that, esp during the pregnancy journey when every other day you have so many questions that you need some sensible answers and inputs (with so much unwanted information coming from all directions). My 9 months of pregnancy journey was a breeze. She helped me to maintain a healthy pregnancy journey. I even made 3-4 trips during my second trimester after discussing on do's and don'ts with her. 

I had a normal vaginal delivery a month back, and trust me when I say she was like a solid pillar & strength helping me through the whole labour. I got admitted at 11am and got out with my little bundle of joy at 4pm. First thing I did the next day when she came to check on me was to give her a tight hug.

She heard us patiently and suggested best course of action always.
We already did a Lamaze course and were well aware of best practices for gentle birth and told the Dr about her preference weeks before birth to which she assured and also added few practices that may differ due to situation around labour time. We told doctor about our preference on normal vaginal delivery and the preference was well supported by her.
She was reachable through whatsapp and even through phone during the labour time at night.
Unfortunately due to long labour and inability to progress we needed to opt for a C section, but she supported us throughout, she even offered labour induction to respect our decision for a normal delivery which we thought would prolong the pain and hence chose to undergo C section.

Sometimes at odd hours if we had any doubt she used to reply in few mins which gave us confidence and moral support. My wife had water break at 38th week and general trend is doctors tend to do c-Sec to avoid further infection. But in our case we were lucky that Dr Anupama ma’am had used her vast experience and took decisions on time and tried inducing pain and pushed us towards normal delivery keeping all the scenario in mind. I must say it was Dr Anupama madam efforts and timely guidance during pregnancy that we had normal delivery.

I had a positive birth experience and I owe it to her for that. I had a normal delivery through episiotomy at the end of 40 weeks and delivered in 3.5 hours of getting admitted to the hospital. She waited till the due date and guided me to go through the early labour at home and come to the hospital only when I reach the active phase of labour. During delivery, when I had a complication, she persistently tried without showing any sign of urgency and kept me updated on what is going on.

This being my first pregnancy, had lot of doubts and apprehensions about my experiences. She would address them all and explain the rationale all with cheer and patience. Finally, she would also reiterate that it was very common among pregnant women and that everyone goes through experiences which is unique to each pregnancy.

She shared her contact number and always clarified my concerns with a prompt response. This gave me an additional comfort factor that I can reach out to a reliable person during times when I am bogged down by multiple guidance from people around me.

She is someone who prescribes only necessary medication and advises the same to be stopped when the symptoms do not surface.

I conceived at high body weight and suffered through cold, cough and liver malfunction during pregnancy which made me quite worried and tensed for my baby but she handled everything so well that nothing bad happened during, while and after delivery. She also used to calm my nerves over phone or in-person when needed. She was also persistent for natural delivery till my final moment but since I was unable to bear the labor pain, we had to go for C-section. Throughout my pregnancy period she asked me to follow diet, perform yoga and physiotherapy which helped me huge during and after delivery. My body recovered also quickly. I would highly recommend her for pregnancy consultation and for delivery. I could not think anyone better than her.2.
