We have put lot of questions to clear our doubts and doctor has never got tired to answer us and very patiently addressed all our doubts. During the 9th month Doctor kept my wife under weekly observation to monitor amniotic fluid levels which was at margin tending towards low levels and personally monitored it. When we enquired about VBAC (Vaginal Birth after C-section), she promptly and clearly gave us pros and cons of it. Hence, it really helped us to decide on it.  Once we decided for VBAC she reassured and supported us to go for it. During delivery she supported my wife and made it possible to delivery through VBAC.  These days it is very difficult to see woman getting a normal delivery but Dr. Bharti has ensured to get VBAC even though risks are higher than normal veginal delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"We wanted to have a normal delivery and Bharti mam helped us throughout the journey.  We were in regular consultations and always walked out with a positive attitude after talking to mam. 
On the D day the induced labor pain started to kick in but the cervix was not dilated enough. Adding on top of it meconium was found during the water break. Mam was in analyzing the situation and helped us understand the situation. Baby's heart beat was decreasing during contractions and Mam actually turned the baby's head and helped us deliver the baby normally. 

Really thankful for all help and would recommend Bharti mam all the time if couples are looking for normal vaginal birth. ",2022-11-03 17:19:50,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
