 We were pregnant with twins and were in 26.6 weeks running, everything was going well until we had appointment in my regular hospital for regular check up. During scan our doctor noticed she could see some membrane it‚Äôs seems, which was sign of cervix might be got open. Hence for expert advice we got referred to Dr Manjula Patil at Motherhood hospital HRBR layout. Over there during scan and investigation she found my wife cervix was completely opened and doctor was able to see membrane. It seemed both babies were okay and around 900 gm weight by then but the challenge was if the cervix kept it can be ruptured anytime which will lead to premature delivery.

Dr Manjula madam explained all the details and pros and cons about the surgery. So now the only option was left to stich the cervix by pushing the babies inside which itself was great risk and chances of success was less than 5%. We didn‚Äôt had much options so in order to save the little ones from premature delivery which itself was great risk for their survival. Anyhow we decided to go as per Dr Manjula advice for cervical stitches. There was also high chance during the cervical stitch procedure babies could push back and which would lead to emergency C-section. 

Dr Manjula Mam took the heroic stand and was successfully able to push the babies inside and stitched the cervix. Post which my wife was kept under observation for 48hrs, and when everything was normal we were allowed to go home. 

From here on the journey was more tough everyday was like a bonus for us and every week was like a milestone. At home my wife was on completely bed rest and was only allowed to get up for bathroom use.

Days went slow from here on, after completing 30 weeks we had a scan and everything was found normal and baby growth was also good. Babies weight was around 1.5 kg. 

We reached 32 weeks, which was the minimum target set by the doctor, both babies were doing good.

Staring 34 weeks my wife started feeling more pain and discomfort, back was also started hurting during sleep. During the regular visit Dr Manjula checked and found the cervix was barely trying to hold the pressure. So she updated it was time for delivery. 

On 22nd March we got admitted and on 23rd March we are blessed with twins baby girls !! First baby weight 2.2 kg and second baby 2.3 kg. Both babies and mother are doing good, for observation both babies were kept in NICU. 

From NICU One baby was handed over after 24 hrs monitoring and another one after 36 hrs. Both the babies are healthy and doing good now. This miracle journey for our babies wouldn‚Äôt been possible without support of Dr Manjula Patil !! 

Me and my entire family is very grateful to Dr. Manjula Mam for her support and giving new lives to our babies. We had a very remarkable experience with Motherhood. We want to thank each and every staff of motherhood for their dedication and support.

Introducing to Dr Manjula Patil ma‚Äôam was my most luckiest part in my pregnancy as I had a history of cervical incompetence and we had lost our 1st baby due to that, 

knowing my history she was very careful, honest and explicit in telling and explaining us each each and everything( pros , cons and what are the chances, etc .,) in the doing the procedure of cerclage, 

Having undergone the procedure successfully I completed my 1st trimester under clear guidelines of Doctor. 
Hoping for good and having faith pushed 20 weeks of pregnancy and underwent anomaly scan too‚Ä¶ no risks was seen.,  everything was normal ‚Ä¶
but there comes next hurdles ‚Ä¶ one fine day had simple itching down there and had to get scan immediately‚Ä¶ scan showed the cervix was starting to  reduce‚Ä¶
Under ma‚Äôam‚Äôs clinical treatment was advised to take Bedrest for next coming weeks until further notice ‚Ä¶

To my fate the very next scan was also not pleasant as the cervix had started to funnel and I had to be monitored very closely‚Ä¶ without any hesitation ma‚Äôam advised to get admitted to hospital so that i can be monitor very closely under her .
God‚Äôs plan was different this time ‚Ä¶.

With so much of effort and precautions taken too‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt escape with contractions‚Ä¶.
Dr madam took all the steps again to push me to complete at least 28 weeks ‚Ä¶ the entire team of Dr Manjula ma‚Äôam had taken mighty steps in helping me to achieve our mile stone of 28 weeks‚Ä¶ 
But with tremendous pain for 4 continuous days with all medicines and drips couldn‚Äôt push further ‚Ä¶.
She took the big decision by convincing us and with the support of the whole NICU team did the emergency Csection ‚Ä¶ at last we were the proud parents of a baby girl ü•∞
Having filled with happy tears in our heart made us happiest parents in this world even though on the other side we had the anxiety of how our small little one will fight for her life‚Ä¶ 

Prays from each one of us‚Ä¶ Blessings from our elders and well wishers ‚Ä¶ Enormous efforts from NICU Doctors & team and our little one‚Äôs mightiest effort in struggling for life made our dream come true ‚Ä¶.

Our pregnancy journey has been so smooth despite all the medical complications. All thanks to Dr  Manjula for navigating us through it. We reached out to Dr Manjula when we were planning to expand our family. Right from the very moment we consulted her she was kind and empathetic. She understood from where we were coming and listened to each and every question patiently even if some of those were silly doubts.Post consultantation we started on our journey and finally concieved. My first trimester was pretty turbulent. I was nauseaus, literally puking my guts out. Everytime my hopes and morals went down, Dr. Manjula lifted us with her energy and medical expertise.Second trimester for us was a breeze! We were even able to take a little vacation. All these while Dr Manjula was available on whatsapp and responded whenever we needed any counsel. That was a huge assurance and relief.Cut to third trimester, it almost felt like the plane that was flying well up until now was about to sink! I started getting pre term labour contractions. I was admitted multiple times. It was painful and exhausting. There have been multiple times when we thought the baby will come anytime prematurely but Dr Manjula somehow stayed calm. I dont know how she does it but it felt like she was on a battle for us to nurse the baby till full term. It would have been probably easier to take out the baby at 29 weeks but Dr Manjula did everything in her capacity and managed navigate the pregnancy from 29th week till 34th weeks, up until my water broke! Finally our Amaya came into this world on 5th May, 2021 via c-section. Honestly, I was very skeptical about c-section but medically that was the best option at that point and we trusted Dr Manjula's judgement on it fully. She helped me get over my fear. My recovery was super quick. I was pretty much back on my feet next morning. All of these could happen because Dr Manjula had faith! She is not just an exceptional Doctor but the sweetest person we know and we are so glad that she delivered our baby. She has that motherly, humane touch which is so rare to find.Also, big vote of thanks to all the LDR doctors and nurses team, nenatology team, pediatrics team, canteen staffs, housekeeping staffs and the rest everyone at Motherhood, HRBR Layout for taking such good care of us. Since our baby was preterm, she needed that extra care. Even admidst covid scare, motherhood's nenatology team took utmost care of our baby and we cannot be thankful enough!I was admitted so many times that by the time we left the hospital we formed that bond. We could not have asked for a better journey to become parents",2021-05-08 21:13:21,False,True,Tithi Sharma,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Maternal Care/ Checkup,Prenatal Checkup,",0,0,YES,"This could easily be too small space to provide a detailed Feedback. Let me break this into couple of parts for anyone who is reading this while planning to consult Dr.Manjula especially during Early Pregnancy.

What, When, Where, Who and Why's :

What:
What made me select Motherhood Hospital and consult Dr.Manjula?
I have been introduced to Motherhood about 2 years ago for another procedure. The experiences I had during the procedure made me realise that the Doctors, Staff, facilities and Services offered in Motherhood were above my expectations. I am not even going to try to compare other hospitals, I witnessed the number of births and happy parents within the same week in this hospital.
Nalini was the first person I spoke to from Motherhood, during the phase when we were planning for Dual Opinion and Delivery/Birth. We specifically requested for an experienced doctor with great patient history. She recommended Dr. Manjula, couple of weeks later We are thankful to her, Doctor and the entire staff.

When:
a) When did I decide to have the delivery with her help?
I have had 3 Missed abortions in the past, all with no heartbeats. During the 4th Planned pregnancy (where my and my husband were not planning to take any Risk), We had been consulting 2 Doctors for dual opinion. One being from another Hospital from RammurthyNagar. I did decide to stay only with Dr. Manjula, **** ** **** ******* ********* ** *** ******** *** ********* ********* If I went by her opinion, My child would've been born in June last week coz of the Cord around the neck and Thin Placenta. On the other hand, Dr. Manjula adviced that there's no reason to be worried and to continue until the first week of July with a NST Scan. She assured us that everything is under control, and gave us a heads-up that only when I felt there's no baby movement or water bursts I need to get admitted immediately. Thanks to her suggestion, It indeed went well, everything went smooth !!

b) When was she helpful and supportive?
- During the regular visits to hospital
- Even when i just planned to walk-in after her normal consultation hours/duration, she stayed back for us !!
- During the Prenatal Phase when I had questions about the changes in my body, risks, and updates, she answer every piece of my query.
- During the Natal Phase/Delivery/Birth. She ensured the safety of myself and my baby, kept my husband updated/informed at every stage.
- The day when I was getting Discharged
- After the delivery, she continued to answer my questions.

Where:
Where did I get her help?
a) At the Motherhood Hospital, HRBR Layout, on every visit i got positive advices, suggestions and vibes from her.
b) At Home, She was available for direct calls/messages.

Who:
Who should meet or consult Dr. Manjula?
All Expecting Parents, especially first pregnancies. She is an expert in Normal Deliveries, To be honest My Delivery was almost painless bcoz of her expertise, and her team !! Although I truly appreciate her team, her efforts outshines everytime i recall how nervous we have been since it became our first successful birth !!

Why:
Why should you consult Dr. Manjula (Instead of any other doctors around HRBR Layout, Bansaswadi, Rammurthy Nagar, Hennur Area)
If you are close or in this area, good for you, go for the consultation with her. Trust me, you'll feel better when you would step outside of the hospital.
She listens to your query, goes thru every minute detail of your/Patient's case history, performs thorough checkup and recommends medication and tests only if its required. She may give you all possibilities in the future based on your case of pregnancy and scenario, to ensure you're prepared in every possible way, this is Awesome !!",2021-07-14 19:05:19,False,True,Preetima Vishwakarma,,,

"Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I am writing to express my profound gratitude for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Manjula S Patil at Motherhood HRBR Bangalore facility.

My wife and I embarked on a challenging journey after experiencing a miscarriage in the 5th month of pregnancy in 2021. The emotional pain was overwhelming, and it was during this challenging time that we sought the guidance of Dr. Manjula. Though our subsequent attempt, post her consultation, ended in the fetal heartbeat stopping at 8 weeks, Dr. Manjula's empathetic approach provided us with the strength to persevere.

Following a six-month break, we decided to try again with the hope that things would be different. Unfortunately, history repeated itself, and my wife had to undergo her second DNC. It was during this phase that Dr. Manjula's expertise shone through. She identified the root cause‚Äîan Autoimmune issue. With proper treatment over the course of 8 months, she instilled confidence in us and committed to guiding us through the process once again.

Under Dr. Manjula's unwavering guidance during our third attempt, the level of care and dedication she demonstrated was beyond description. She made herself available at any time of the day or night, addressing even our simplest doubts. Her reassuring demeanor provided us with the confidence that we were in safe hands. We had regular check-ins every 15 days to ensure that the pregnancy was progressing well.

On 23rd November 2023, our journey with Dr. Manjula culminated in the birth of a healthy baby girl. The joy and gratitude we feel are indescribable.

This review serves as a testament to the remarkable doctor that Dr. Manjula is. Her services to the people at your HRBR Bangalore facility are nothing short of amazing. I implore you to recognize and preserve the treasure you have in her.

Additionally, I would like to highlight that if anyone is going through a complicated pregnancy, Dr. Manjula S Patil is the one to contact. Her expertise, compassion, and commitment make her an invaluable asset to the medical fraternity.

My medical history, encompassing diabetes and a prior open myectomy, was intricate. Dr. Manjula expertly orchestrated the entirety of my pregnancy, orchestrating meticulously timed consultations and tests. Throughout, I never felt overwhelmed, drawing strength from each interaction with Mam.

During the initial and middle phases of pregnancy, I encountered concerning bleeding episodes.

Dr. Manjula is not just an amazing sweet friendly doctor but a kind and wonderful human being. She is so sensitive and considerate about your problems with amazing intuition , politeness and patience for patients that most indian doctors unfortunately lack. I have been told by other doctors ""Not to Google and ask questions!!"" Which is terrible advice especially for first time parents.

An expecting mother has every right to politely ask as many questions about her medication or options or issues because the doctors abroad that I was accustomed to were really trained in psychological counseling and being polite and kind to patients which I was looking for in a doctor here in Bangalore during Covid after shifting back to India.

After visiting and consulting many doctors who I prefer not to name I was shocked with the unprofessional and rude - sometimes downright dictatorial insensitive behavior of some so called doctors who hold many degrees but unfortunately lack the technical knowledge and human kindness - empathy for a patient. I sincerely am impressed with Dr. Manjula's knowledge and skills/expertise. I told her I am very comfortable with a c section if needed as I trust her judgement completely but she insisted on a normal vaginal delivery and in Dec 2020 - I gave birth to a healthy baby boy despite some of the complications I felt safe and secure the entire time as she patiently explained the pros and cons to me and my husband answering all our questions.

She is the only doctor I have met with no chaotic - negative energy around her at all , its very positive blessed vibes which is why I wanted her to be the first person to touch our child as they do say some of the personality and positive energy is transferred onto the child. :)  In india with the quality of doctors depreciating as far as I have seen its a rare few that are genuinely interested in your well being so please choose wisely.

Since I work in Healthcare industry was aware about Motherhood Hospitals, which gives at most care and attention to both Mother & Child. So decided to consult there for Surgery. 

While looking at list of Doctors available at the nearest Motherhood Hospital HRBR layout branch was confused for a moment to choose a right Doctor from the avaliable list for consultation. 

While looking at the details of Doctor's with their specialization and experience, we made up our mind to consult with Dr.Manjula S Patil. Which was one of the best decisions we took.

We met the doctor for the first time in the first week of January 2022. We never felt like it was the first time that we were consulting with doctor, actually after meeting the doctor we felt like having an association with the Doctor for ages. This feeling came to us because of the very friendly nature of Doctor with her special way of approach. 

Before meeting the Doctor we had decided to undergo the surgery on 28.01.2022 due to weekend and also due to some auspicious reasons. The same date was discussed with Doctor for surgery, Doctor asked whether we can do the surgery one prior or later to 28th. But we requested Doctor for doing the surgery on 28th itself and Doctor agreed to do it in the morning around 6.30am

Dr.Manjula S Patil was there at 6.30am sharp and executed the surgery for around 4hrs. The surgery was very much successful. 

Dr. Manjula madam treated us like one of her family members from day one to till date.

I really appreciate the dedication of Dr.Manjula Madam for giving respect and value for request by conducting the Successful Surgery on 28.01.2022 inspite of her family commitments which we came to know later that it was Doctor's wedding anniversary on that day. This is one of the reasons we felt that she has treated us has her family member giving priority to our request. 

Me and my wife render gratitude to Dr.Manjula Madam from bottom of our heart and will be thankful to her Motherly affection shown to us. I'm really blessed to get my wife's treatment done under the guidance of Dr.Manjula S Patil. 

I would really suggest my family members, Friends and the people who are reading this to consult with Dr.Manjula S Patil related to Obstetrics and Gynecology & For Fibroid treatment.
