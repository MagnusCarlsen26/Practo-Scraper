My History- in April 2016, my first child took his last breathe at 36.3 weeks and there were no reasons known why that happened in an extremely normal pregnancy. There were no problems reported ever during the term.

Currently- I am carrying again 27 weeks, and visiting Dr. Anuradha in cloudnine jayanagar, after a good recommendation from our family friends. 
I have found her so far to be very calm, sweet and understanding my concerns properly. I feel connected to her whenever i visit her, and ask so many questions. She respects time and wants us also to be on time of our appointment which i liked a lot. She doesn't seem to be money minded till now and has not offered unnecessary tests for me.
