None,None,0,0,Yes,"I highly recommend Dr. Sowbhagya B. From the stage of pregnancy to delivery, she has guided us with great care and kindness. But I am not very pleased with the nursing staff as they seemed inattentive at times. While I had some queries about the post delivery precaution, they never really helped me with that. After multiple attempts of probing, I got something in the form of assistance at the end. I understand that they were engaged with some busy work but they should be cooperative with some basic needs. So the hospitality is not that great. *** *** ****** ** **********",2020-01-24 10:54:42,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
