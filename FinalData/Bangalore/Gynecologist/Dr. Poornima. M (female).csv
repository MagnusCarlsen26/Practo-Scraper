Five years ago, my first baby was delivered via C-section in my hometown. From the initial stages, Dr. Poornima encouraged and supported decision to pursue a natural delivery, despite my concerns stemming from my previous C-section experience

Her expertise and compassionate guidance were instrumental in ensuring a successful natural delivery, which was a truly empowering experience. Dr. Poornima's dedication extended beyond delivery, with thorough postpartum care that provided reassurance and support.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"Dear Poornima Ma'am,

I don't think I'll ever be able to fully express how much you have done for me and my baby. I am so fortunate to have you as my doctor. As my pregnancy journey comes to a joyous end with the arrival of our precious baby, I am filled with immense gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional care and support you provided throughout this remarkable journey.

In the early days of my pregnancy, I had other gynecologists, and I found it extremely frustrating during visits when I felt rushed, confused, uncomfortable, and even left with questions I still needed clarification on. Choosing you as my doctor was the best decision I have ever made. I received completely different care from you. You have always listened to every single question and concern of mine and have given extremely thorough explanations that I actually understood.

From the very beginning, your expertise and genuine passion for your work were evident. Your thoroughness in monitoring the progress of my pregnancy, your attention to detail, and your willingness to address any concerns made me feel confident and well-cared-for at every step. I remember running to Google for every diagnostic result or scan comment and getting panicked; the best advice you gave me was not to Google things but rather to ask you, and believe me, that made my journey peaceful. I know sometimes I was annoying and asked irrelevant questions, but you never lost your calm. That's why I call you my peacemaker ;)

Your approachability around the clock made me feel secure and relaxed; you were always just a ping away for me. The way you explained each thing, be it my food intake, exercise, or even tiny details of my daily routine that needed care, was remarkable.

The day of delivery was nothing short of extraordinary. You were never in a hurry, as you told me in the beginning that I was going to have a normal delivery. Without your encouragement and support in the labor room, it wouldn't have happened. My family and I are incredibly grateful for the safe and healthy delivery of our baby.

Beyond your medical expertise, it was your kindness and genuine interest in our well-being that made this journey truly special. Your commitment to fostering a positive and trusting patient-doctor relationship has left a lasting impression on us. * *** ******** *** *** *** *** **** ****** * **** **** ************ and I am a patient of yours for life.

Thank you, Poornima Ma'am, for being an integral part of this incredible chapter in our lives. Your genuine care has made our pregnancy and delivery experience truly memorable. We feel blessed to have had you as our gynecologist.

For my wife without having any exposure to any doctor's review or word of mouth we just got our first consultation with Dr.Poornima M and we stuck to the same doctor till the delivery not because of any gut feel its purely because of her patient friendly nature engaging the patient in explaining ""how important the motherhood and what all efforts it takes to go though the smooth journey plus  the  openness about the delivery procedures""  finally the humbleness we saw from the first meeting itself gave us confidence to stuck till the end. Today we are extremely happy with Mahalakshmi( Baby Girl)  gave birth in our family , Dr.Poornima M is absolute gem in OAR branch she kept motivating my wife with right instructions, follow ups and explained the every step and procedures very detailed way made us very comfortable and felt like one of the family member.since we din't have any exposure to discuss about the maternity we believed Dr. Poornima M as one of the family member and so did the Doctor by responding quickly to our concerns over just a text message.Dr.Poornima M delivered our first baby in absolute normal fashion, From the day 1 she motivated us for normal delivery ,infact she honestly admitted us saying "" C-Section would be easy for the doctor to complete the procedure""  however the doctor motivated us till the end for the normal also gave the clarity keeping any complications one should be open to other procedures too. This clarity and detailing i beleive one should be having as it helps during the labor room. As an husband to my wife there were few well informed decisions i had to take during this process and our Doctor explained very clearly the importance of right decision making with logical reasoning behind the decisions to be made during the labor room procedure. It's very natural that most ppl will get panic and go clueless once the patient enters the labor room. Therefore about the decision making being strong but not adamant during the delivery process is extremely important and  I was well educated and informed by the doctor  hence I was very confident and complete calmness was established to go through the pressure situation. The delivery labor room experience itself one can pen down the journey and make it as a short story 😊 as it involved twits and turns , Dr .poornima M consistent motivation towards my wife to get the baby out completely normal without any external additional artificial stuff was the high point in the story. Infact at one point after the 10 cm dilation done my wife almost given up that she couldn't deliver the baby normal she was totally drained out with no energy left which i visibly experienced. I was extremely nervous but kept my complete faith in our doctor , The heroic entry around 3 AM doctor turned to our rescue in the labor room she motivated my wife to give all her energy to push the baby out , but tough luck my wife lost her energy and looked like she couldn't take anymore.Doctor came up with an excellent presence of mind to make her stand 2 feet lil wide open to get advantage of the gravity while again giving deep grunt pushes which worked a bit where baby's hair was visible when doctor again asked my wife to lay down on the bed. What a motivation that time doctor gave i was there witnessing while also i was totally numb but keeping my nerve as I kept saying to myself  ""we are with the best doctor out there"". After multiple pushes by my wife with the lil support from nurse staff one more deep push plus the doctor's very tiny space cut down resulted us in normal delivery coming out Mahalakshmi(baby girl) to this world :😊Tears automatically came for both of us. Such a great feeling which is unexplainable.The very next day my wife was able to walk naturally and now while i am writing this after 2 weeks of delivery she is back to her original condition.today  both the baby and my wife are doing absolutely  fine.

Exactly same thing happenedPrecisely after 37 weeks we had consultation with our doctor and doctor did initial cervical stripping to induce the labor contractions just naturally , there you go after that in few days i had to admit my wife as she was feeling the contractions throughout the day and her water broke  37 weeks 5 days water broke out I rushed to hospital and finally THE biggest gift of my life happened 😊.

From the beginning of my pregnancy, Dr. Poornima motivated me to go for Normal delivery (when initially other doctors scared me that since I had PCOS and am of short height, Normal delivery is not possible for me).

She is so friendly and approchable that she answered many of my doubts and questions over the phone through out my pregnancy so that I can stay at the comfort of my home without worrying.

During the day of my delivery, she visited me at 9 PM and again motivated me that I am doing good and will soon be meeting my baby. I got very tired towards the end and had given up.

She is a great pleasure to work with. I got a better opportunity in the UK and moved there. I wanted to deliver my baby in cloud nine the moment I was pregnant. While looking up the doctors to get my appointment I saw Dr Poornima, who is now a consultant. I was so happy that I booked her appointment immediately. I told my family about her and they were all waiting to meet her. When I came to Bangalore we visited her as a family and it was a great experience. She was still the same Doctor that I knew who is funny and kind. I wanted a Normal delivery and she was very supportive not only to me but to my family as well and motivated me till the last moment when I was on the labour table. I had a normal delivery finally and she was there by my side throughout. It was a great journey and I loved every bit of it. Me and my whole family are very thankful for bringing us our little bundle of joy safely. She’ll always be in my prayers. Thank you so much ma’am. ",2023-02-22 07:11:33,False,True,Ceasar/Joshua,,,
,,0,0,NO,"The doctor was extremely unpleasant to talk to, and I wouldn't recommend her to anyone who has questions about their menstrual cycle. She was rude and dismissive while answering my genuine inquiries. I couldn't understand why her consultation, which cost 1000 bucks, was limited to the number of substantial questions only, as she deemed mine irrelevant and baseless. I eventually expressed my dissatisfaction, explaining that I hadn't visited a gynaecologist regularly and wanted polite explanations to my inquiries. Instead, she criticised my age and lack of planning for a baby, comparing me to a 25-year-old's fertility, lack of decision making, etc. Her manner of discussing age-related factors and conception felt like she blamed me for not getting pregnant within my first year and a half of marriage.

Initially, she didn't mention any issues with my menstrual cycle, but when I started asking questions based on the then going discussions, she abruptly claimed that my lack of conception meant I wasn't ovulating properly and I am unnecessarily contradicting her statements by asking irrelevant questions. I politely explained her that I had some doubts and wanted to clarify them by asking her because she's a doctor, and I believed she could help alleviate any concerns. However, she didn't take it positively. Her rude and harsh tone was unacceptable, *** *** ****** *********** ** *** **** **** *** ***** *** **** ****** ** ********* ** ******** ******* The decision to have a baby or not lies with the spouses. I regret visiting this doctor. I explained that I wasn't from a medical background and needed proper explanations for my questions, but she responded rudely, making me uncertain about what I could ask her. She even angrily wrote the prescription because of a question I asked, which upset her.
