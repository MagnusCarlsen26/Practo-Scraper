All the medicines, injections, mock tests were very helpful in achieving the result.  Today by God's grace and Dr.sangeetha's treatment I am able to conceive.\nShe is a senior doctor with zero attitude in apollo cradle.

Her neutral approach eased our journey, without undue false hopes.\n\nOur first IUI attempt got successful and today I have completed my first trimester. \n\nWhat truly distinguishes this doctor is her accessibility during emergencies over call and WhatsApp. This was very comforting. \n\nI'm grateful for Gynac's competence and support. She  helped us realize parenthood. Highly recommended!",

In all our interactions with her, we\u2019ve noticed that she is very ************ ** *** **** ** expertise and treats the patient really well. She doesn\u2019t ask for any unnecessary procedures or tests and for all the tests that she does prescribe she explains very clearly why we\u2019re doing it and how it can help in further treatments. \n\nWe had already consulted a few doctors and gone through previous IUI\u2019s which were not successful, so we decided on going ahead with the IVF cycle with Dr Sangeetha. She asked us if we wanted to try an IUI cycle with her and then go for IVF and it was our choice to go ahead with IVF as it gives much more of control on the treatment and the success rates. Of all the doctors we had seen so far, we did find Dr Sangeetha easy to talk to if we had any queries at all. \n\nI also highly recommend the talks that she gives on Apollo\u2019s Facebook page with regards to several aspects of fertility treatments and it gives a thorough understanding of how and why the treatments are done and what she is looking for when prescribing tests or procedures. She will make sure that you\u2019re on the right path with the treatment she prescribes leading to success. I\u2019m a very very happy patient who has taken her help in conceiving and is carrying a tiny little one now. \n\nThanks a ton doc and I highly recommend her!! ",

We feel lucky that we happened to meet her. \n\nShe's quick in receiving the patient, understanding the issue and prescribe in detailed. Our every interaction with her was good, and we always carry a lot of positivity and knowledge. Many times we found that she shows the passion, hard work and commitment. She drives for the result with either less or no risk in everything she does with a proper analysis and proactive thinking. We were very expressive because of her comfort and many times we discussed more than her as we wanted to discuss and clarify even the small things, and she was very attentive and listen to us, and answer everything.\n\nWhatever the procedures she done for us were really awesome and she does very good pre and post procedure activities, and it makes anyone to feel good for the procedure rather worry, and also come out happily and get into the regular work as normal. We always feel inspire when she talks to us because she comes to the level where we can understand the things and motivate the patient by discussing and showcasing the incremental improvements even if it's small.\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha for consulting any kind of infertility as she has a very good abilities to deal the issues, and she's excellent in IUI and IVF treatments, and if followed her suggestions and instructions strictly as prescribed, the desired result will come.\n\nI wish Dr. Sangeetha and the fertility staff in Apollo Cradle continuously doing the good work, making things reality the science can do miracles and make the people happy like us.",

I was previously diagnosed with PCoD and had irregular cycles so we wanted to know if there were any underlying problems or concerns that we need to address soon.\n\nOn my first visit, Dr. Sangeetha took down all the details, my health history and family history as well. She explained the different reasons why natural conception may not occur and the possible treatments for each issue. She put me on a path to monitor my cycle first. She also recommended a semen analysis for my husband to rule out all possibilities for potential problems in conceiving. \n\nAfter one month of monitoring my cycle, ovulation induction and husband taking some oral medication prescribed by the doctor, we have now conceived. We did not expect this to happen so soon as doctor mentioned that probability is still low and may take a few months. \n\nShe is realistic and straightforward in her approach. She patiently answers whatever queries one may have. She explains the medications and treatments that she is prescribing to the patients so we are aware of what we are doing.\n\nAfter the positive home pregnancy test, when I met her again, she explained what will be the course of action, the medications I need to be on, risks with my pregnancy, etc. She also explained upto what point she can help with after which she will hand over to another gynec for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nWe are very grateful to have found her and to have her expertise, help and guidance through this phase. I highly recommend Dr Sangeetha if you are having trouble conceiving.",

All staff are very friendly and supportive.\n\nI have previously visited 3 other gynecologists from different hospitals but I didn\u2019t get the satisfaction that I got from mam.

With the Dr. Sangeeta we feel more convinced for our treatment due to her rich experience of counselling and step by step approach of treatment.",

Unfortunately, it resulted in a biochemical pregnancy. We were finally very close to achieving our dream, but it shattered at the last moment. But without wasting much time, the doctor advised us to undergo IVF immediately to maximize our chances. Her advice during each stage was very helpful, and she listened to our problems as well. And finally, the day arrived for the implantation. However, we were 100% confident that it would be a success. Perhaps this confidence stemmed from the fact that we were in the best hands. Finally, we were blessed with twins. I would recommend any couple who is suffering from infertility to consult Dr. Sangeetha. Sometimes in life, problems will come, but we ensured that we are giving the best opportunities to fix those problems.",

Never hesitates to respond to phone calls or messages. Though she is young her experience on infertility issues is really appreciable. The confidence which she cultivated in us during our visits has made our dreams come true in spite of being one of the most complicated cases. She has got some magic in her hands( might be bcoz of her genuinely patient-centric approach)  and that worked for us. I would highly recommend her to any couples seeking assistance for any fertility and gynecology related issues.\n\nEarlier, we consulted all top-notch gynecologists in Bangalore where the process of giving a lot of medicines from their own pharmacy was their main motto.\n\nThank You, \n\nSumathi & Gowrishankar",

Her extensive knowledge and experience were evident throughout our consultations.\n\nWhat truly stood out to me was her unwavering support and encouragement during the emotional rollercoaster that infertility can bring. She never hesitated to offer reassurance and went above and beyond to make the entire experience as smooth as possible.\n\nThe level of personalized care I received from her and her team was outstanding. They were always prompt in addressing any concerns and showed genuine care and empathy at every stage of the process.\n\nWith her guidance and expertise, we are now proudly expecting a little one, and we are eternally grateful for the miracle she helped make possible.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Sangeetha to anyone seeking fertility assistance. Her expertise, professionalism, and compassionate approach truly make her an exceptional doctor.\n\nThank you, Ma'am, for changing our lives and making our dream come true!",

We had experienced before with other fertility doctors and hospitals who care only about money but we were blessed to meet Dr Sangeetha after 2 unsuccessful attempts of IVF with different doctors. We finally got our good news from Dr Sangeetha's treatment with her 1st attempt itself. *** *** ********* ********* *** prescribes correct medicines suitable to me. Even though she is very busy she takes enough time to consult each patient so that all their queries are clarified. The staff(Chandrakala sister, Chandini Sister ,Uma Sister and Jennifer) working under Dr Sangeetha are also very kind and helpful. I would highly recommend her if you have any fertility issues. The only problem we faced in apollo cradle is the waiting time to meet the doctor is more because the number of patients are always more. Thank you so much Dr Sangeetha for making our dream come true. We are really grateful to you.",

I had PCOD issue and my husband was having poor sperm motility and morphology. With the help of medication suggested by her, my husband\u2019s semen parameters were improved. After the careful consideration of our health conditions, she suggested to go with IVF treatment. The entire treatment cycle was very smooth and doctor will give you proper line of treatment as per your needs. She is very much dedicated towards her patients and is available anytime on phone, messages to answer your queries.The entire staff including Chandrakala sister, sister Chandani, Jennifer were so cooperative and helpful during the entire treatment.However, waiting time might be there for consultation/scans as there are lot of patients coming to her due to increasing fertility issues and she alone handles consultation, scans and all the procedures for all her patients alone. She is a great doctor with such magical hands. For me, my IVF got successful in the first attempt and now she is taking care of my post pregnancy medication. We are glad that we found doctor Sangeetha and continued my treatment with her. She is one of the best fertility specialist in Bangalore with very high success rates. I would highly recommend her if you are facing any kind of fertility issues!!",

She gave me hope even in the most bleak days. She started with ovulation induction treatment and after HSG  Frist month I got surprise,I am carrying now 3months ,we are happy now,As a doctor she is very proficient (if i could give 5000 stars \u2b50\ufe0f!) my hysteroscopy went really smooth. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. And staffs are very co operative and very kind. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that such personal touches and care for a patient with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend them!",

Even after shifting to a far place, we were clear in our mind that we will continue our treatment with her only. Throughout our journey, she was super supportive and worked with so much dedication to make it a success. We had our low days but she would always tell us why do you worry so much. If there is one doctor who puts her heart and soul into the process, its her. We just followed her instructions blindly and we got the result. She was always available to answer any queries we had. Dr Sangeetha is truly a blessing for us. ",

Though fertility treatments are expensive and taxing to overall peace of mind, if you have the right doctor guiding you, the process becomes much smoother. Thank you Ma\u2019am for everything. Would highly recommend couples facing infertility issues to get yourself checked with Dr Sangeetha. She is the BEST! ",

We met Dr.sangeetha, she suggested to try normal pregnency as no other issue except fibroid. I conceived in 2months and mam explains clearly with patience, I get clarifications for even a small query, she takes time answers and explains it very politely . she also explains on the medicines why and what is the use of it. she is available over whatsapp and calls as well to clarify if we have any doubts. I just followed what she said, proper exercise, food etc. and yes it's positive now and I am consulting her in further pregnancy checkups. I strongly recommend her, just follow and do what ever she says and bundle of happiness will be urs. Thanks a lot mam for all the suggestions and support towards us.",
