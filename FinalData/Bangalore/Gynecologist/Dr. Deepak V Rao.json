Hence I write this review.\nMy case: \nI had a miscarriage, though been continuously consulting an able doctor in a commercial, successful exclusive maternity hospital. \n\nI took enough gap to allow my body to fully recover, then started consulting \u201ctop rated\u201d gynecologist for other competing maternity hospitals to find reasons for my miscarriage and how I can start over again **** ***** *********** I was to discover that the hospitals & doctors are focus on optimal churn out of patients / cross selling services from linked   diagnostic centers and promoting high margin drugs. There was no CARE for my condition nor was there right guidance.\n\nAt this junction, one good friend asked me to Meet MR Deepak Rao from Rashmi Hospital\n\nRashmi Hospital is in Indiranagar, Double Road Bangalore. Walk in to this hospital I saw a sea difference from other hospitals, It\u2019s a modern highly equipped hospitals minus the \u201ccommercial\u201d MBA business approach. The recipe any patient with complicated pregnancy case would look for.\nDr Deepak Rao, studied all my reports [again a difference from other hospitals who would suggest to get all tests done again in their own linked diagnostic centers] \n\nThis time when I got pregnant again, Dr ensured that all my medical parameters are carefully checked, soon not only I discovered why I had a miscarriage in the first round but this time around Dr Deepak Rao was carefully weighing options for my medication. He was in touch with us on phone/ email/ sms and I always felt secured. \nAt this junction, all was not well to my husband too. He had to go through an operation. Though my husband was not a patient to Dr Deepak Rao. My doctor would always ask him about his health and would be concerned to our health. [Optimal time taken for patient consultation was not his priority \u2013 CARE was]\nEven at the last weeks when I had developed a condition that resulted into C section Dr Deepak Rao ensured my baby and I are safe.\nToday my bundle of joy is 10 months, I visit Rashmi Hospital to meet the pediatrician there, but if our doctor Deepak Rao pass by, He ensures he talks to us in person and genuinely shows care.\nIn short if you are looking for a gynecologist who establishes connect, showers care, gives time, treats your condition optimally and you are in Bangalore \u2013 Only Dr Deepak Rao & Rashmi Hospital.\n",

I was given medication for two cycles, was diagnosed with a hemorrhagic cyst, finished my medicinal\u00a0course, and then met them for a follow-up check. When an ultrasound disclosed nothing, they had to perform a trans-vaginal scan. I was feeling fine until I discovered that I had a dermoid, which, to my dismay, was twisted. I went to Dr. Deepak for a second opinion after the first doctor told me that the only option left to me was surgery. \nDr. Deepak gently broke the news to me that I would undoubtedly need surgery after taking the time to explain about what went\u00a0wrong with me. He gave me a lot of encouragement throughout and was quick to address my silly concerns. My surgery was indeed successful, and my recovery thereafter wasn't too difficult too. He has managed to keep my anxiousness in check, and I am genuinely delighted with my experience. He is an incredible doctor with high\u00a0experience and is excellent at what he does.\u00a0 \u00a0\nI am truly pleased with my experience. He is a fantastic doctor with deep expertise who excels at what he does.",

Hence I write this review.\nMy case: \nI had a miscarriage, though been continuously consulting an able doctor in a commercial, successful exclusive maternity hospital. \n\nI took enough gap to allow my body to fully recover, then started consulting \u201ctop rated\u201d gynecologist for other competing maternity hospitals to find reasons for my miscarriage and how I can start over again **** ***** *********** I was to discover that the hospitals & doctors are focus on optimal churn out of patients / cross selling services from linked   diagnostic centers and promoting high margin drugs. There was no CARE for my condition nor was there right guidance.\n\nAt this junction, one good friend asked me to Meet MR Deepak Rao from Rashmi Hospital\n\nRashmi Hospital is in Indiranagar, Double Road Bangalore. Walk in to this hospital I saw a sea difference from other hospitals, It\u2019s a modern highly equipped hospitals minus the \u201ccommercial\u201d MBA business approach. The recipe any patient with complicated pregnancy case would look for.\nDr Deepak Rao, studied all my reports [again a difference from other hospitals who would suggest to get all tests done again in their own linked diagnostic centers] \n\nThis time when I got pregnant again, Dr ensured that all my medical parameters are carefully checked, soon not only I discovered why I had a miscarriage in the first round but this time around Dr Deepak Rao was carefully weighing options for my medication. He was in touch with us on phone/ email/ sms and I always felt secured. \nAt this junction, all was not well to my husband too. He had to go through an operation. Though my husband was not a patient to Dr Deepak Rao. My doctor would always ask him about his health and would be concerned to our health. [Optimal time taken for patient consultation was not his priority \u2013 CARE was]\nEven at the last weeks when I had developed a condition that resulted into C section Dr Deepak Rao ensured my baby and I are safe.\nToday my bundle of joy is 10 months, I visit Rashmi Hospital to meet the pediatrician there, but if our doctor Deepak Rao pass by, He ensures he talks to us in person and genuinely shows care.\nIn short if you are looking for a gynecologist who establishes connect, showers care, gives time, treats your condition optimally and you are in Bangalore \u2013 Only Dr Deepak Rao & Rashmi Hospital.\n",

I was given medication for two cycles, was diagnosed with a hemorrhagic cyst, finished my medicinal\u00a0course, and then met them for a follow-up check. When an ultrasound disclosed nothing, they had to perform a trans-vaginal scan. I was feeling fine until I discovered that I had a dermoid, which, to my dismay, was twisted. I went to Dr. Deepak for a second opinion after the first doctor told me that the only option left to me was surgery. \nDr. Deepak gently broke the news to me that I would undoubtedly need surgery after taking the time to explain about what went\u00a0wrong with me. He gave me a lot of encouragement throughout and was quick to address my silly concerns. My surgery was indeed successful, and my recovery thereafter wasn't too difficult too. He has managed to keep my anxiousness in check, and I am genuinely delighted with my experience. He is an incredible doctor with high\u00a0experience and is excellent at what he does.\u00a0 \u00a0\nI am truly pleased with my experience. He is a fantastic doctor with deep expertise who excels at what he does.",
