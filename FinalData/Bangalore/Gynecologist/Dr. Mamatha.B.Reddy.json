Throughout the pregnancy, she was so supportive and kind. She explained everything so nicely that our 9 month journey passed without any hiccups. On my delivery day, we went to the hospital in evening, she came and encouraged me for normal delivery as I was only 2 cm dilated , then after about 3 hours she came back( though everyone was expecting delivery in morning only) as I was dilated to 6 cm and delivered happened around midnight. Trust me i gave up on normal delivery but it was only doctor who made it possible, it was normal with forceps as I was really tired with so much pain. Doctor was there at night till I got shifted to my room and handed over to my husband . She explained everything to him as our child got hurt a bit on head due to forceps but with god grace everything was good and it was only superficial scar. We are very happy to have her as our doctor as she handled the situation brilliantly and did what was necessary. Now after a month me and my son both are healthy and happy. Thanku so much doctor for taking care of me and my child *** ***** ** ******* ** **** *** ***",

Dr. Mamtha is very straight forward, she don't suggest any unwanted medicines until it's very much required for you. And she ensure that I am properly informed about my health and care. We have visited her in Suraksha hospital for my first pregnancy. She is very practical, calm and friendly. She always listens to our query very patiently and given good suggestions. She explained everything to me in a very clear manner. She has made our pregnancy journey very smooth. She used to explain upcoming test and scans required for me. On the day of my delivery my water broke all of sudden at 37th week, I called her she asked me not to panic and reach hospital asap as I was soo scared. After check up I was given medicine to increase my pain. During delivery my baby's pulse was not fine she encouraged me to push and it was only because of her I was able to deliver baby naturally (forceps assisted). Big thanks to Dr. Mamtha. *** ** *** **** ** *** *******\nI would highly recommend her to everyone without a single doubt. ",

I had to call several times to get in touch with the Doctor and she responded with a very harsh attitude and never initiated to call us back and say sorry or gave the money back.

Consulted multiple doctors earlier and we are absolutely glad/feel blessed that we found Mamatha mam for her positivity and she made sure that we progress through our pregnancy smoothly till delivery. We were new to everything in this area as we had just shifted and we chose Femiint as the clinic is nearby for us and the doctor based on her reviews. We totally didn't have much clues about the doctor at the beginning but she proved with her way of communication and approach during every visit that she is simply awesome..!! Her straight forward, positive approach and guidance is highly appreciated and very professional. She has always been patient enough to clarify/answer all the doubts and questions we had everytime. Have recommended her to my friends. We are now blessed with a beautiful and healthy baby girl through normal delivery as she planned and consulting her for post delivery guidance as well. Thanks a ton Mamatha mam..!! :) ",

I have never been in situation of normal delivery, it was only and only her who believed that it is possible and yes we did it. \nWe have been blessed with healthy baby girl on 30th July 2019. The full joruney of my pregnancy I was able to pass *happily* is because of her, I have faced issue of broken placenta, tangeled cord around baby neck, baby's tricky movements and my mood swings but she was the one who kept me high in each situation. I kept on saying for C-sec but she was very positive that we will try for normal and here I am.\nI have lot n lot to say about her an endless praising for her. She is very precise and lovingly Dr. In each and every way,\nI would always suggest for any kind of Gynec consultation to visit Dr. Mamtha.\n\nShe is and will always be the best for me....\nThank you soo much Dr. Mamtha...",

Even though we consulted her for 5 months (later we went to our home town for delivery)we got so much of confidence from her. she will clear all your doubts before you step out of her room. By god's grace we are blessed with a baby boy. We are really Thankfull to you Madam for every thing.",

Night she stayed in the hospital and making visit during midnight's.\n\nFinally, due to some issue - she had to do ke c-section, she handled with very care and I was blessed with an baby girl.\n\nTrust me ther are still some doctors who try for normal delivery as well...Dr Mamatha is one among them.\n\nI would highly recommend everyone to visit her during pregnancy.",

Also femiint fertility centre recommended as their facilities are really good as compared to other hospitals. The doctor always available for any sort of medical advice. She always make sure her patient is cared enough and leaves with no doubts after the consultation. And recently I have realised that the doctor never scared me though I had few medical issues. She chooses the right way of approach to put it across hence the patient feels comfortable. And the medical procedure in femiint hospital is really well organised and confidential.Unfortunately, I have to leave Bangalore and continue my pregnancy checkup in my hometown during my 7th month of pregnancy. Thank you so much doctor for your kind support and guidance!",

Throughout the pregnancy, she was so supportive and kind. She explained everything so nicely that our 9 month journey passed without any hiccups. On my delivery day, we went to the hospital in evening, she came and encouraged me for normal delivery as I was only 2 cm dilated , then after about 3 hours she came back( though everyone was expecting delivery in morning only) as I was dilated to 6 cm and delivered happened around midnight. Trust me i gave up on normal delivery but it was only doctor who made it possible, it was normal with forceps as I was really tired with so much pain. Doctor was there at night till I got shifted to my room and handed over to my husband . She explained everything to him as our child got hurt a bit on head due to forceps but with god grace everything was good and it was only superficial scar. We are very happy to have her as our doctor as she handled the situation brilliantly and did what was necessary. Now after a month me and my son both are healthy and happy. Thanku so much doctor for taking care of me and my child *** ***** ** ******* ** **** *** ***",

Dr. Mamtha is very straight forward, she don't suggest any unwanted medicines until it's very much required for you. And she ensure that I am properly informed about my health and care. We have visited her in Suraksha hospital for my first pregnancy. She is very practical, calm and friendly. She always listens to our query very patiently and given good suggestions. She explained everything to me in a very clear manner. She has made our pregnancy journey very smooth. She used to explain upcoming test and scans required for me. On the day of my delivery my water broke all of sudden at 37th week, I called her she asked me not to panic and reach hospital asap as I was soo scared. After check up I was given medicine to increase my pain. During delivery my baby's pulse was not fine she encouraged me to push and it was only because of her I was able to deliver baby naturally (forceps assisted). Big thanks to Dr. Mamtha. *** ** *** **** ** *** *******\nI would highly recommend her to everyone without a single doubt. ",

I had to call several times to get in touch with the Doctor and she responded with a very harsh attitude and never initiated to call us back and say sorry or gave the money back.

With Dr. advices and positive talks helped us to overcome this loss.In Oct 2019, My wife was again carrying and we started our routine check ups with Dr. Mamatha Reddy with all new joyful attitude.  With all excellent care and treatment throughout pregnancy, on 23rd June 2020 we blessed with baby boy as normal delivery though my wife experienced complications in 7th month and having miscarriage in past.

We were new to everything in this area as we had just shifted and we chose Femiint as the clinic is nearby for us and the doctor based on her reviews. We totally didn't have much clues about the doctor at the beginning but she proved with her way of communication and approach during every visit that she is simply awesome..!! Her straight forward, positive approach and guidance is highly appreciated and very professional. She has always been patient enough to clarify/answer all the doubts and questions we had everytime. Have recommended her to my friends. We are now blessed with a beautiful and healthy baby girl through normal delivery as she planned and consulting her for post delivery guidance as well. Thanks a ton Mamatha mam..!! :) ",

I am so lucky to have been in under her care.\nShe helped me to overcome through some difficult days of my pregnancy. I have never been in situation of normal delivery, it was only and only her who believed that it is possible and yes we did it. \nWe have been blessed with healthy baby girl on 30th July 2019. The full joruney of my pregnancy I was able to pass *happily* is because of her, I have faced issue of broken placenta, tangeled cord around baby neck, baby's tricky movements and my mood swings but she was the one who kept me high in each situation. I kept on saying for C-sec but she was very positive that we will try for normal and here I am.\nI have lot n lot to say about her an endless praising for her. She is very precise and lovingly Dr. In each and every way,\nI would always suggest for any kind of Gynec consultation to visit Dr. Mamtha.\n\nShe is and will always be the best for me....\nThank you soo much Dr. Mamtha...",

The way Dr.Mamatha gives support and care is really appreciatble. During our first visit we had so many doubts about pregnancy but once we started talking to her we felt so comfortable, she is very patient enough to explain all our doubts(some times she explained in telugu as well which is our mother tongue). Even though we consulted her for 5 months (later we went to our home town for delivery)we got so much of confidence from her. she will clear all your doubts before you step out of her room. By god's grace we are blessed with a baby boy. We are really Thankfull to you Madam for every thing.",

Night she stayed in the hospital and making visit during midnight's.\n\nFinally, due to some issue - she had to do ke c-section, she handled with very care and I was blessed with an baby girl.\n\nTrust me ther are still some doctors who try for normal delivery as well...Dr Mamatha is one among them.\n\nI would highly recommend everyone to visit her during pregnancy.",

Also femiint fertility centre recommended as their facilities are really good as compared to other hospitals. The doctor always available for any sort of medical advice. She always make sure her patient is cared enough and leaves with no doubts after the consultation. And recently I have realised that the doctor never scared me though I had few medical issues. She chooses the right way of approach to put it across hence the patient feels comfortable. And the medical procedure in femiint hospital is really well organised and confidential.Unfortunately, I have to leave Bangalore and continue my pregnancy checkup in my hometown during my 7th month of pregnancy. Thank you so much doctor for your kind support and guidance!",

I think that would move faster.. will never ever visit again.. updating the review.. after a wait for an hour.. when I go enquire about my appointment I get to know then that Doc has gone for emergency.. i understand when an emergency comes she needs to attend.. but what are the concerned people doing.. they didn't even bother to inform about the status and they just made me wait.. seriously heights of irresponsibility..",

There was a known complexity for my wife throughout the pregnancy, but every time we talk to the doctor, it boosts with positive energy. As per all scannings, our expected baby weight was more and we all are prepared for C-Section as we know my wife's condition is not good due to many consequences.Finally the day has come and from the moment we admitted my wife in the hospital, the doctor was on time and she was assisting my wife with so much encouragement. My wife delivered baby with with the unexpected weight of 4.7kgs and that to it was a normal delivery!!! at that moment, we felt she has done some magic :). We all are extremely satisfied with Dr.Mamatha throughout 270 days, we have never seen such a down to earth, so simple... doctor in my life. From my heart, our experience with the doctor was so memorable and we all from our family strongly recommends her!!",

She helped me out with the respective treatment except, She was bland considering how all gynae problems should be seen a bit personally/emotionally. It was my first ever visit to a gyno and my level of consciousness was long forgotten seeing the poor/unorganised condition of the hospital. Most importantly, the appointment I scheduled through practo was cancelled, As the receptionist informed they had closed online appointments...I had to take a fresh appointment and wait for about over an hour. The receptionist took forever. She was so lost that she had forgotten I paid the amount I had to. Instead, she asked me to stay back insisting the same is pending. While I was forced to put down my foot and plainly mention \" I am leaving\"  although I didnt intend to be rude. I had the receipt she printed out for me. Special mentions to the toilet which was in no way to be considered a toilet fit for a multi speciality hospital where, hygiene is primary. I had to demand for the toilet paper and explain it's a mandate in a hospital while the nurse told me \" Sorry madam, we have no tissues.\" which left me astound. I have a photograph of the toilet if I have to attach it. I believe this hospital and its services are over rated on practo and they should re consider the ratings.  ",

I request you to take strict action against her by my experience I don't suggest people to take tests in this hospital. Thanks",

She's really good at finding the right cause of the problem/catches the right way to find what is causing the problem, and asks the right questions, and is genuinely concerned about her patients well being. I did not had to wait much long when I visited the Suraksha Hospital to see Dr. Mamatha Reddy. The receptionists were friendly and navigated me with the formalities with a good attitude. I went there for normal pregnancy checkup & some personal issues. And got a prescription for couple of tests which are being done at a different location. I am very pleased with my choice to have Dr. Mamatha Reddy as my primary physician. Will be waiting to visit this doctor again with the recommended medical test reports but not at this location. The hospital is not clean and there were street dogs roaming inside the hospital, despite parking issues we had to pass, we got to see unclean premises with some group of men sitting in the visitor bay (which is opposite to doctors room) and teasing nurses with nick names. ETC...etc...etc. I would strongly recommend this doctor but not in this Hospital.",

The doctor herself visited late post 10am to the hospital which made the entire wait time to shift by more than 1hour. I reached at sharpe 10:20 but had to wait until 11:45am!! I think doctor should value and respect patients time and patience. She should reach on time which can save her as well as her patients time.\n\nOr else hospital should simply stop this appointment concept at the first place, first come first serve should help everybody",
