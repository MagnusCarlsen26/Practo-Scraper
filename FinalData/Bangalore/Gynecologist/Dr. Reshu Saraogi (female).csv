"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy,Bleeding During Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I got my baby boy delivered via normal vaginal delivery under Dr Reshu Saraogi's care. I would highly recommend Dr Reshu for any Gynaec issues. She is very soft spoken, yet she speaks to the point. Her medications and diagnostic tests are also very much to the point - not too less or not too much. Her clinic has walk in consultation early in the morning, which enables us to consult with her without taking leaves on working days. She's available and responsive on whatsapp chat for pregnancy related doubts.I had suffered from a missed miscarriage and chemical pregnancy loss last year and was totally heartbroken by it! When I conceived again, I consulted Dr Reshu. 1st trimester:Knowing my prior history, she took extreme care and monitored me and my baby very closely during the first trimester. I had internal bleeding issue, which got caught during her monitoring. She advised me bed rest until 5th month as the internal bleeding was not yet affecting the baby. It's indeed a blessing that I came across Dr Reshu, else this issue could have been missed or detected much later!2nd trimester:My bleeding issue got resolved but I got infected with covid via my husband. I got a panic attack about getting infected with covid from my hubby and got concerns about baby's health if I do get infected! Here Dr Reshu's composure, soothing voice and friendly tone - along with my complete faith on her - helped me sail through the entire covid infection. Physically the infection was very mild but emotional stress was much higher. Here Dr Reshu helped me calm down and handle my emotional stress, which was a major part of fighting the infection! This is very rare among doctors nowadays! I held on to her words whenever I felt panicky and fought the infection with more courage!At the end of covid, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Dr Reshu handled it very well and kept it under control with the right amount of tests, diet changes and medicines.3rd trimester:Since my placenta was anterior high, dr allowed me prenatal yoga. Baby's and my health were all fine so she didn't order unnecessary scans. However she's always available and responsive on whatsapp for doubts and queries as during the third trimester, symptoms can get confusing. I always kept Dr Reshu informed about anything which I felt was odd. Her responsiveness helped me keep myself sane and also avoided unnecessary trips to clinic for every small questions.Delivery: I had to be admitted to hospital in emergency as my amniotic fluid has started leaking. However, the labour and delivery went quite smoothly. Dr Reshu was constantly monitoring my status from on duty doctors, until she reached the hospital. She delivered my baby with her cheerful and energetic voice to give me extra energy to push as I was getting tired towards the end! She brought my beautiful baby boy in this world üíï May God shower her with all the blessings, happiness and success in the world! ",2021-10-14 17:17:49,False,True,Payal Parate,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Uterus/ Uterine Prolapse Treatment,Laparoscopic Myomectomy,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy is the most beautiful phase of any women's life, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Reshu for taking utmost care during my journey to motherhood. It was a precious pregnancy, and we visited 3 doctors before meeting her. In our first visit to Dr. Reshu, as soon as our conversation started , a sense of trust got instilled inside and we were extremely satisfied. She took extreme cognisance of my medical history and kept on tracking all medical reports with diligence. Unlike other doctors, she gave us ample time during our visits, ensured all the queries got answered and always provided reasons behind prescribed medicines. There were lots of instances where we felt, she has no interest in making moey from her patients by suggesting unnecessary scans/tests instead all her suggestions, medicines, scans , tests were backed by strong rationale. As the time passed , the TRUST we had on her was unbeatable, whatever she said, we just accepted without any second thought. She tried for my normal delivery till the last moment but due to some complications and to eliminate any underlying risk , she immediately took me for Cesarean. During my Cesarean, she kept talking to me, kept me calm and made it a cakewalk.

She guides you like a mentor, treats you like a family and these qualities make her an amazing doctor and a wonderful human being. The positive vibes from her would make her patient feel so safe and secure.

At last , just want to say, I strongly feel she is just like her name- and nothing can go wrong if you are under her treatment, that's my level of trust and confidence on her.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We had our first trimester in Dubai, and unfortunately we didn‚Äôt experience good doctor in Dubai (Aster Clinic) . However, we realized we need to have better consultation and approached Dr Reshu for online consultation while we were there.

Dr Reshu is well known in our circle with our family and friends and we knew from the starting we were in good hands. The online consultation and the assurance ,especially when the first trimester was complicated ,  was a boon for us, we were actually getting to know more from the phone call with Dr Reshu about what to expect and medication/food recommendation.

Although after first semester, we planned to come back to Bangalore as we were not comfortable in Dubai. Thereafter until the delivery , the journey was smooth and as per expectation. Dr Reshu is very patient and would  listen to our query and answer with lot of information, every visit to her was our excitement to know about our baby more.

The consultation and online support (quick WhatsApp chats) really helped us to live fearless and enjoy this pregnancy period as we knew what to expect every week and she was always there for a quick chat or phone call which assured her presence always.

Also to mention, our labor experience was also swift and smooth  given we had some challenges and Doctor handled it nicely and this experience is something we would treasure it for life-long.

I highly recommend to consult Dr Reshu mam for your parental journey. If you have any complications/issues please visit her without thinking twice..

We are blessed with baby in July‚ù§Ô∏è and we are thankful to Dr. Reshu mam for her guidance and treatment.",2022-11-22 04:56:33,False,True,Simanta Das,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"The saying that ""Doctors are God‚Äôs reflection on earth"" holds true for Dr. Reshu and the credit for ensuring a safe pregnancy for us through difficult circumstances is well deserved.

We had suffered an unexpected loss of our first child in Aug 2019 during 7th month of pregnancy and were devastated. It took us 6 months to cope up with the emotional and physical stress to gather ourselves to try again. We did not want to go ahead with previous physicians as we felt that enough attention was not paid during the critical months that may have resulted in our loss.

Dr. Reshu came as a saviour and we felt a renewed hope with positivity visiting her clinic in Whitefield. Initially , we were taken aback by her cool , mature and focussed approach to managing pregnancy. We were hoping for long motivational sessions with her to address our apprehensions and fears. However , Dr. Reshu‚Äôs mantra was to not look back trying to replay any event from last pregnancy and take everything one step at a time. With Covid 2nd wave creating a huge concern , she calmed our nerves and explained all the risk factors as well as her interventions.

When it came to decide on the final date for delivery , she actively recommended that we go ahead with the procedure in 37 weeks instead of waiting any longer to avoid foetal distress. We had utmost trust in her and by God‚Äôs grace we are blessed with a baby girl who just turned 1 in Aug 2022.

We cannot recommend Dr. Reshu and Cogent clinic enough to expecting parents as you would be in expert hands , in a positive environment and receive matter of fact explanations one step at a time.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"Not a good experience with Dr. Reshu..I also went to see her reading the reviews here but..here are my experiences;

1) first of all the clinic is a bit small and had some kind of smell but that is something I can ignore if the doctor is good
2) They stuck to the appointment time but seemed like Dr. Reshu was in a bit of rush to honor the subsequent appointments and did not thoroughly go thru the reports & lab results from a previous visit to another hospital just couple of days ago
** *** *** **** ********** *** ******** *** *********** ********* *** **** ** ****** ** ** *** ********* ******* *** **** ** **** **** ***** ********** ******* ****** **** ***** *** ********** ** *** ******

a) She said there is only 50 % chance for miscarriage to be removed by medicines whereas the other doctor said it is over 90%
b) Therefore, she seemed to be suggesting to go for a manual removal under general anesthesia without considering & giving time for it to be removed naturally (which is what happened just a day after her deadline to get it done). Now, when these things can come out naturally and it doesn't harm to wait for a few days more, Dr. Reshu was erring in taking the undue risk of anesthesia for a procedure that was not necessary & urgent.
c) Not sure what her motive was but your guess is as good as mine.

I am just glad that we went to other doctor, took her advice and it came out naturally without any medicines or manual intervention.

Consulted the doctor, got the scanning done by the doctor and also gave the blood sample.
Finished everything in 30min including billing.
Everything is very fast here, awesome doctor and helpful staffs.

I met Dr. Reshu again after 5 days with my blood tests and other check ups. I was surprised to see that they didn't charge anything this time. 

Consultation was similar, very nice and pleasant. Doctor gave sufficient time, explained everything in detail and made the complete road map for us how to go ahead.

We are really very happy with the clinic staffs and doctor. 

We strongly recommend Dr. Reshu Saraogi for any pregnancy related issues and also the infertility problems.

Just on discussing with our friends in office, I came to know that she is the gynaec of many of our colleagues in office and all of them have similar views for her. 

She is simple, calm and down to earth, not money monetary minded and completey patient centric.

She did the laparoscopic surgery for uterus remover for one of my friend s mother, because of her treament one of my colleague undergoing long term fertility treatment conceived. 

And with God s grace and the ample support of Reshu mam we alco completed our family with a beautiful kid.

We wouuld be everly obliged to you and will recommend you to anyone who has female problems.

You had more patience than us and you waited and waited for the baby to deliver normally. It was really successful at night, and my wife could go home the next day. It's really amazing to see doctors spending their night also sometimes in the hospital with the patients and again start their work in the morning as routine.

20 Stars for doctor: First I have consulted with Dr. Reshu madam in 2016 and she helped me to conceive naturally. She made me feel very positive. She is very calm and patient. She will never write any unnecessary medicines or never advise any unnecessary tests. She is a big supporter of normal delivery and always advises to be strong. She was always available over whatsapp and promptly replies to even small doubts I had. I am blessed with 2 kids and both are delivered healthy by Reshu madam. My second child was delivered during Covid19 times and she has suggested and guided us well in taking right decisions. I would say , it is a big big big positive feedback from my side.

10 Starts for Staff: The staffs are well trained and have good experience in handling. They are very friendly ,focused and have very good attitude and compassionate towards patients. During Covid19 all staff are wearing PPE and are maintaining very good care and hygiene in the clinic.

10 Stars for Caretakers: The extra stars for the caretakers of the clinic who are maintaining full hygiene of the clinic during these times. They are also on their toes and keep on sanitizing the places every time the patient uses a place.

10 Stars for Clinic/Management: The clinic is so well located, has a lift, spacious and they know how to manage the patients well and we did not had any discomfort during any of our visits to clinic.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We had our first trimester in Dubai, and unfortunately we didn‚Äôt experience good doctor in Dubai (Aster Clinic) . However, we realized we need to have better consultation and approached Dr Reshu for online consultation while we were there.

Dr Reshu is well known in our circle with our family and friends and we knew from the starting we were in good hands. The online consultation and the assurance ,especially when the first trimester was complicated ,  was a boon for us, we were actually getting to know more from the phone call with Dr Reshu about what to expect and medication/food recommendation.

Although after first semester, we planned to come back to Bangalore as we were not comfortable in Dubai. Thereafter until the delivery , the journey was smooth and as per expectation. Dr Reshu is very patient and would  listen to our query and answer with lot of information, every visit to her was our excitement to know about our baby more.

The consultation and online support (quick WhatsApp chats) really helped us to live fearless and enjoy this pregnancy period as we knew what to expect every week and she was always there for a quick chat or phone call which assured her presence always.

Also to mention, our labor experience was also swift and smooth  given we had some challenges and Doctor handled it nicely and this experience is something we would treasure it for life-long.

I highly recommend to consult Dr Reshu mam for your parental journey. If you have any complications/issues please visit her without thinking twice..

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"The saying that ""Doctors are God‚Äôs reflection on earth"" holds true for Dr. Reshu and the credit for ensuring a safe pregnancy for us through difficult circumstances is well deserved.

We had suffered an unexpected loss of our first child in Aug 2019 during 7th month of pregnancy and were devastated. It took us 6 months to cope up with the emotional and physical stress to gather ourselves to try again. We did not want to go ahead with previous physicians as we felt that enough attention was not paid during the critical months that may have resulted in our loss.

Dr. Reshu came as a saviour and we felt a renewed hope with positivity visiting her clinic in Whitefield. Initially , we were taken aback by her cool , mature and focussed approach to managing pregnancy. We were hoping for long motivational sessions with her to address our apprehensions and fears. However , Dr. Reshu‚Äôs mantra was to not look back trying to replay any event from last pregnancy and take everything one step at a time. With Covid 2nd wave creating a huge concern , she calmed our nerves and explained all the risk factors as well as her interventions.

When it came to decide on the final date for delivery , she actively recommended that we go ahead with the procedure in 37 weeks instead of waiting any longer to avoid foetal distress. We had utmost trust in her and by God‚Äôs grace we are blessed with a baby girl who just turned 1 in Aug 2022.

We cannot recommend Dr. Reshu and Cogent clinic enough to expecting parents as you would be in expert hands , in a positive environment and receive matter of fact explanations one step at a time.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"Not a good experience with Dr. Reshu..I also went to see her reading the reviews here but..here are my experiences;

1) first of all the clinic is a bit small and had some kind of smell but that is something I can ignore if the doctor is good
2) They stuck to the appointment time but seemed like Dr. Reshu was in a bit of rush to honor the subsequent appointments and did not thoroughly go thru the reports & lab results from a previous visit to another hospital just couple of days ago
** *** *** **** ********** *** ******** *** *********** ********* *** **** ** ****** ** ** *** ********* ******* *** **** ** **** **** ***** ********** ******* ****** **** ***** *** ********** ** *** ******

a) She said there is only 50 % chance for miscarriage to be removed by medicines whereas the other doctor said it is over 90%
b) Therefore, she seemed to be suggesting to go for a manual removal under general anesthesia without considering & giving time for it to be removed naturally (which is what happened just a day after her deadline to get it done). Now, when these things can come out naturally and it doesn't harm to wait for a few days more, Dr. Reshu was erring in taking the undue risk of anesthesia for a procedure that was not necessary & urgent.
c) Not sure what her motive was but your guess is as good as mine.

I am just glad that we went to other doctor, took her advice and it came out naturally without any medicines or manual intervention.

Myself mandakini , one of the patient undergoing treatment under dr. reshu for infertility . It's been 3 years , i have been trying for a baby . I had gone to many gynaecologist but none of them have found out the cause of fertility in me ..it's been only 2 months under  dr.gursimran Kaur and mam has found  the cause of my infertility by doing a very important and simple procedure ..which I know many of the ladies are scared of . It's called Diagnostic hysteroscopy and laproscopy. Last week I underwent this procedure at Manipal hospital. She did my surgery very well . I thought it is going to be a painful procedure but it was absolutely not. Here under anaesthesia u don't feel any pain and my report came out to be normal. I was not aware that I had a polyp in my cervix that was kind of blocking the passage . Mam removed it and i was told as per my HSG report that my left tube is blocked , but during this procedure they will also examine ur tubes and ovaries , uterus and everything was normal . So I just want to convey this message to all the ladies out there who are worried and scared to carry out this procedure..this procedure is very safe and Dr. reshu is one of the finest laproscopic surgeon. I want to thank Dr. reshu for ruling out the cause and for carrying out the surgery so well. Today is the 6th day of my surgery and I am absolutely fine , doing all my house hold stuffs , even I have joined back my office. Post operatively there was no complication. I want to thank all the nursing staffs , medical staffs at Manipal for their care and specially their smiling face and the way they will treat will make u forget all ur stress.I would highly recommend all those who are advised for this DHL procedure should go for it without any hesitation .",2022-07-23 01:59:16,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

Dr. Reshu Saraogi has good reviews in Practo in Whitefield region. Keeping this in mind we went to check for 2nd opinion for the first time, as we were not satisfied with previous Dr whom we consulted initially at MANIPAL.

Since my wife has PCOS she was not able to conceive since 2 Yrs of marriage. 
Dr Reshu quickly understood what is the problem and what is the treatment to be given to get pregnant at the earliest keeping the age factor in mind. It was clearly explained to us. She made a positive hope and thus we had trust and started the treatment from her. She is good in analysis and gives proper advise/guidance. During this Pandemic situation, as a Dr she does her duty well by checking the patient with high safety and with care. Both husband and wife are allowed to consult with Dr. We can sit near to the Dr and explain the problem where as other Dr don't even allows us to sit near. We are happy being consulted with her. 

Cost is very reasonable when compared to other famous clinic and hospital. Appointment is first come first serve through token system. She herself will take scanning and explains us showing the screen Monitor. She has lab inside the clinic so one can give blood or urine samples there itself and charges are same as like other laboratory centers. We could see many people coming from long distance. They maintain social distancing and has sufficient space to sit. Clinic will be busy from morning 8AM. Attenders/Nurse/Billing people are humble. They were not panic at all when more crowd comes.
