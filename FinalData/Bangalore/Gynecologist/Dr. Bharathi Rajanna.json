Then one of our fiend gave the reference of Dr. Bharathi Rajanna and we visited to her and in our first meeting only i told her that madam i want to go to IVF as i cant wait more to have a baby, she was too patient and listed our problems calmly and asked me to do some blood tests and come back after we went to her with report she explained me the problems in a very simpler manner which i can understand asked me to reduce my weight once and then if that also did not work out then we will go for next level is what she told(She rejected to go for IVF, which shows her empathy/kindness/genuineness). And with her constant help, support and proper guidance i conceived naturally and delivered safely for a girl baby.\nThank you soo much madam, with out your support my pregnancy would have been a nightmare.

When our initial efforts of conceiving a child met with no success, disappointment was writ large on our faces. In an opportune moment, a family friend advised us to consult Dr. Bharathi Rajanna. She did study my case comprehensively and opined that there isn't a reason to worry and advised that I turn towards a healthier lifestyle. She said that I need transformation rather than treatment. As the days passed by, I felt confident and had positive vibes. Although it took over 8 months, I conceived naturally and that too with twins. :) Throughout my pregnancy, the doctor guided me like a mother and never did I face any issues whatsoever. I'm indebted to her forever. Shortly after my twin daughters turned two, I conceived again with a singleton. With the pandemic raging all across, I was obviously worried about medical management during pregnancy. The doctor was always available over call and I felt assured throughout. I delivered a baby boy towards the end of third trimester and there was no limit to the joy of our family. None of this would be possible without the noble efforts of the doctor.",

I was suffering from acne for a long time (2 years). Visited a lot of Dermatologist wasted a lot of time and money. None of them were helpful. I had for a long time guessed that my acne was hormonal and the template soap and ointment the dermatologist prescribe was not going to help me. Dr. Bharathi listened to me understood my issues. Directed me to take hormonal tests to check everything. She prescribed three tablet, one to treat hormone, one supplement with various nutrients and one with anti biotic and pro biotic. Slowly but surely my acne started healing. it did not dry out or destroyed my skin. it just healed slowly from inside. Earlier my face was filled with huge red painful cystic acne. It was so bad. Now its healed. just a few marks and tiny one or white heads. It is still healing. I am grateful to her and am completely in satisfied with her diagnosis and treatment. I only wish i had met her sooner. thank you doctor",

When our initial efforts of conceiving a child met with no success, disappointment was writ large on our faces. In an opportune moment, a family friend advised us to consult Dr. Bharathi Rajanna. She did study my case comprehensively and opined that there isn't a reason to worry and advised that I turn towards a healthier lifestyle. She said that I need transformation rather than treatment. As the days passed by, I felt confident and had positive vibes. Although it took over 8 months, I conceived naturally and that too with twins. :) Throughout my pregnancy, the doctor guided me like a mother and never did I face any issues whatsoever. I'm indebted to her forever. Shortly after my twin daughters turned two, I conceived again with a singleton. With the pandemic raging all across, I was obviously worried about medical management during pregnancy. The doctor was always available over call and I felt assured throughout. I delivered a baby boy towards the end of third trimester and there was no limit to the joy of our family. None of this would be possible without the noble efforts of the doctor.",

I was suffering from acne for a long time (2 years). Visited a lot of Dermatologist wasted a lot of time and money. None of them were helpful. I had for a long time guessed that my acne was hormonal and the template soap and ointment the dermatologist prescribe was not going to help me. Dr. Bharathi listened to me understood my issues. Directed me to take hormonal tests to check everything. She prescribed three tablet, one to treat hormone, one supplement with various nutrients and one with anti biotic and pro biotic. Slowly but surely my acne started healing. it did not dry out or destroyed my skin. it just healed slowly from inside. Earlier my face was filled with huge red painful cystic acne. It was so bad. Now its healed. just a few marks and tiny one or white heads. It is still healing. I am grateful to her and am completely in satisfied with her diagnosis and treatment. I only wish i had met her sooner. thank you doctor",

Being so experienced and having lot of patients, I cannot assume if anybody would have taken these kind of care for their patients. She treats each of their patients with great care.\n\nI am blessed with a kid now and this would have not been possible without Bharathi mam's treatment and care.\n\nShe is really a god gift for many of patients like me and has helped to bring smile on lot of people's faces.\n\nOur entire family is thankful to Bharathi mam for her care and helping me to get rid of health issues.
