I delivered a baby boy on 10.3.2022 after 7 yrs of married life. I had PCOS issue which was well treated by Dr and finally I conceived within 1 month of consulting her. 

Then the major problem started which is hypertension, Dr took utmost care of me as if I was her sister. She was always available on watsapp/ call to clear my queries at any given point of time. 

She will never scare you or never leave you with a question mark, she would explain everything in detail which makes us feel relaxed. She will never prescribe unwanted tests or medicines. 

At 1 given point in time, we had to take decision to deliver the baby in 34+ weeks. The way my guardian angel dealt was phenomenal! She gave us time to decide and never rushed for a immediate decision, assured us that baby and me would be fine without any complications. 

She is such a dedicated lady who came early in the morning at 5, just to handle my case! She came with a bright smile and told me to relax everything will be fine! 5.16am my bundle of joy came out to this world! What a joyous moment it was!

All thanks to my dear Dr. Kavitha Lakshmi.

I hope my story will help you to choose the better doctor for your new journey the way it helped me.

I was almost 3 months pregnant when i started visiting Dr Kavita in may 2020, in my 1st meeting itself i was very much impressed with her. The way she made me comfortable and she made me understand that this journey is not a tough journey but a happy experience. there will be health issues, mood swings, vomit, constipation and many other things but i should be relaxed. 

During my all scans and check-ups, she never said any single thing which can be disturbing for me. Even if i had issues, she always explained things very politely.

She was always available on her phone also incase i have any query or issues.

She delivered my healthy baby as if i am her own family member. I am very thankful to her as this journey would have been very difficult if she wouldn't be my Dr. I thank her for all the support and patience she carried during the journey.

Even now after 3 months of my delivery also, if i have any query regarding my health or any issues, she is still always there.

I must say, in this time when medical facilities has become a a curse, she is someone who is doing her job with all her heart..
