We have chosen the hospital(Ovum Hospital, Kalyan Nagar) with my friend’s reference for our 2nd baby consultation and delivery. After going through all the doctor’s profiles, we decided to go with Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri. In fact, it was my wife’s preference. However, we were not sure if we had taken the right decision as we never met her before. After the first consultation, we felt really comfortable and confident. The doctor is very friendly and approachable. We are basically from Tamilnadu and we preferred a Tamil speaking doctor. She helped us feel comfortable even in that aspect. The periodic consultation and diagnosis went very well based on her guidance. The baby’s growth and mother’s health condition were well monitored. Talking about the baby’s delivery, considering the baby's health condition, it’s decided that we need to do the delivery by C-Section. Initially we planned to do the delivery in Week-38. Everything planned for surgery as required. On the day of surgery, I was confused with the questions… is it too early? Will there be any health issues for the baby? etc., I decided not to do it now. Let me wait for another week. With hesitation, I messaged her saying we don’t want to go for surgery today. I was worried if she would get angry at me for changing the plan at the last moment. But, she called me and politely said that there is nothing to worry about, take your time to decide. She was very cool and professional in handling last minute change. I was really surprised and very much thankful to her. Later, we planned the surgery considering the auspicious day and all that. The baby delivery process went very well as planned. My wife was very comfortable in the labour room. She entered the operation theatre with a smile😊 and came out with more smile😊😊😊. I was the one sitting outside with a tense mind! We are blessed with a cute baby girl!!!

I would like to mention about the room booking also. We are eligible for the executive room only for the insurance that I hold. But, the hospital agreed to upgrade to a Premium room which is almost the same as the executive room, not much difference. But, I requested a Deluxe room which is a much bigger room. But, the admin team said there are no Deluxe rooms available. But, the day I came for admission, we were allotted the Deluxe room because of Dr’s recommendation. I am thankful even for that.

"Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"I was recommended Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri by my relative, She also has her own clinic in Nagawara Sree women's clinic-Dr Swetha Vinjamuri, When I checked reviews about her on Google, I was a little reluctant as many i saw many good reviews anyway i went ahead and let me tell that you that’s the best thing that i did. I met her she said pt is healthy and she got all the necessary tests done to make sure everything is fine. the reports said pt had Thyroid High and Vit Low. So she immediately gave the necessary tablets and she made sure she cross checked everything just to be on the safer side which I really appreciate through doctor personal number also she guided whenever we had doubt without hesitating, not every doctor would take that extra step. She didn’t warn patient about anything she said all you have to do is eat healthy and be normal like & enjoy pregnancy.
In the third trimester after scanning from other daignostic source they said baby growth is less, We felt very sad and my wife were crying, After consulting the doctor, (She made clam with her words and made us to feel better that baby is Tiny (Very Small) but this not big issue no need to worry, Once baby come out of mother womb, Baby will grow as normal),
she suggested we could go for induced labour but I obliged. She neatly explained the pros and cons of a delivery. Then At 37th week had delivered a baby boy on Jan 2023. Doc was on time and she didn't visit her clinic on that day, Doctor were staying in the hospital whole night and day. Doctor allowed me to be inside the Labour room along to be beside with my wife, so i had an idea of what was happening around me. She kept talking to me and patient updating about the health condition throughout the delivery i felt so relieved. I trusted her completely. 
Then came post partum she made sure she changed some supplements and she even suggested on what should eat and she kept a tab on iron levels by getting my blood tested. 
So be it pre or during or post pregnancy she was there throughout journey with the same enthusiasm. I would definitely recommend her because she’s such a professional.

Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri is working in OVUM HOSPITAL, We got some reveiew about the hospital is not well Just because of doctor practising in that hospital only we had visited the hospital, Hospital atmosphere is very neat and clean, Nures will treat the patient well, But before one discharge some of the nurse will not care about the patient, Package we too is 65k but it went to till 1lakh for Normal Delivery for both patient and baby, Hospital is not keeping promising prices at least they have infomring bill going beyond the package, Apart from that everything went well

Some doctors are like heroes of our lives who saves us from the misery of pain, Being in a hospital is a terrible experience, but Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri will with her caring and extra effort make the patient comfortable is truly remarkable, Her great explanation of the patient illness give them hope for the postivie things

I’d give her a 10 on 10 for her professionalism and the way she deals with situations. She’s one amazing doctor and a person.",2023-04-25 18:05:27,False,True,Hethesh kumar,,,

Now she told me what is right what is wrong without any hesitation and regular check-up and scan was advised, throught this journey both my husband and I were confident and comfortable with her.

It was a normal delivery for me and the labour duration was just 2 and half hours, she was there checking on me from the start till the end.

One of the standout qualities of Dr. Vinjamuri is her unwavering support and motivation. There was a point during my pregnancy when I felt like giving up on the idea of a normal delivery and opted for a c-section. However, Dr. Vinjamuri believed in my ability to have a normal delivery and motivated me every step of the way. Her confidence and encouragement were instrumental in making it happen.

Throughout my pregnancy, she was always there to address my concerns and answer my questions. Her expertise and knowledge were evident in the way she explained things to me, ensuring that I felt informed and empowered to make the best decisions for myself and my baby.

Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri's compassionate and caring nature made the entire pregnancy journey a positive and memorable experience. I felt genuinely cared for and supported, which is something I will always be grateful for. Thanks to her dedication, I was able to achieve the normal delivery I had initially hoped for.

Before visiting her, I heard lot about her from my relative, and than I viewed her profile in practo, which gave me a confidence that she is the one who can help me during my last trimester. My decision was absolutely correct, from the 1st day till the end she took great care of me, with regards to my health and issues that I was facing during my pregnancy. 

In the hospital as well all the staff says that, She is know for her normal delivery than c-sec. 

It was proved when I gave birth to a beautiful girl child because of her. She was my support and strength on the day when I was admitted for delivery. I MUST SAY: ALL MY LABOUR PAINS SUBSIDE WHEN SHE SAID I'AM WITH YOU, YOU HAVE TO BELIVE IN YOURSELF AND NORMAL DELIVER IS POSSIBLE.  It was normal deliver, and today I feel blessed.
