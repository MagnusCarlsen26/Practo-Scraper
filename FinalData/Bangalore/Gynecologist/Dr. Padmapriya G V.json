No wait time, was allowed to meet the doctor at asked time. She welcomed us with a smile and took time to go through all my report done till date and made notes. She cleared all our queries and no false hope were given. We decided to continue with her. She was there throughout the pregnancy and post that too. Her expertise in this field made us feel comfortable and safe to ask any question without hesitation.She is very kind, listens to patients calmly and understands our situation as to-be-parents. She is always reachable.  Does not charge unnecessary nor does she suggest unwanted tests or scans. We had a very good experience and would highly recommend her. Thankyou doctor for all the support and to make this journey memorable for us \u2764\ufe0f. ",

I got to know about the doctor from Practo app , and went for the consultation in Kashyap orthopaedic center in Navrang, the clinic is at prime location, very hygienic, not too crowded, friendly staff, minimal formalities to book an appointment. On our first visit we found the doctor was somebody whom we were looking for and gradually after few visits she helped us with prepregnancy counselling .\n\nOnly after conceiving, we got to know that she is a OBG surgeon\ud83d\ude05 who delivers baby at top maternity hospitals, we were delighted to continue the Journey with her . She guided us with unbiased suggestions when asked for with regards to which hospital to go with as well. The pregnancy journey was very smooth, as we continued to consult her in the clinic ( who would unnecessary \ud83e\uddd0 pay extra to visit the same doc in maternity hospital) and we were blessed with baby girl \ud83e\uddd2\ud83c\udffb.  Although the pregnancy had all green lights for vaginal birth, last moment the decision had to be made to go with caesarean and we are happy with the decision made and have no regrets. Mother and baby both are doing excellent.\n\n@ Dr. Padmapriya: You really are awsome\ud83e\udd29 humanbeing first of all and our experience speaks how good you are as a doctor/surgeon.\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb for all the kind support till now and going forward. We really have become friends now and considered you as a family doctor \ud83d\ude03and not just patients\ud83d\ude09 \n\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Padmapriya definitely \ud83d\udcaf if you want a doctor who connects very strongly with the patient which i feel is a very important characteristic to look for in a doctor by any patient.",

Dr. Padmapriya, Kashyap Women\u2019s Clinic, Rajajinagar, was our gynecologist throughout the pregnancy and for the delivery.\n\nOur first baby suffered from one of the rarest ailments. None of the pre-natal tests had revealed anything. After 2 months, baby had to succumb to the ailment. Moreover, the duration/time gap for the second pregnancy was well below the prescribed duration. So, this pregnancy was very crucial for us and, probably, challenging for gynaecologist also.\n\nDr Padmapriya went through the reports of our previous baby and accordingly, started the treatment. All through 3 trimesters, we were advised with necessary supplements and tests at appropriate intervals. Blood and urine tests were performed at Kashyap Women Clinic itself. Reception and lab staff were cooperative. Hygiene and maintenance was very impressive.\n\nIn addition to ultrasound scans, a few more \u201cspecial screening tests\u201d at multiple institutions had to be done. This was to ensure that the baby is healthy and free from any kind of ailments. Moreover, Dr guided us through Covid vaccination and 3rd Covid wave (Omicron).\n\nIn each consultation, Dr. tried to understand and address our concerns. She listens. Always accessible over the phone. At times, she also had to even counsel us.\n\nDoctor is a visiting/consultant gynaecologist at several hospitals. So, there was flexibility to choose the hospital for delivery. The delivery (c-section) process was planned and coordinated well.\n\nBoth mother and baby are doing good. In summary, we are very happy with our journey under Dr. Padmapriya's guidance. Grateful too. She is experienced, updated and approachable. From our experience, it will be always comforting and relieving when one is under her care.",

No wait time, was allowed to meet the doctor at asked time. She welcomed us with a smile and took time to go through all my report done till date and made notes. She cleared all our queries and no false hope were given. We decided to continue with her. She was there throughout the pregnancy and post that too. Her expertise in this field made us feel comfortable and safe to ask any question without hesitation.She is very kind, listens to patients calmly and understands our situation as to-be-parents. She is always reachable.  Does not charge unnecessary nor does she suggest unwanted tests or scans. We had a very good experience and would highly recommend her. Thankyou doctor for all the support and to make this journey memorable for us \u2764\ufe0f. ",

I got to know about the doctor from Practo app , and went for the consultation in Kashyap orthopaedic center in Navrang, the clinic is at prime location, very hygienic, not too crowded, friendly staff, minimal formalities to book an appointment. On our first visit we found the doctor was somebody whom we were looking for and gradually after few visits she helped us with prepregnancy counselling .\n\nOnly after conceiving, we got to know that she is a OBG surgeon\ud83d\ude05 who delivers baby at top maternity hospitals, we were delighted to continue the Journey with her . She guided us with unbiased suggestions when asked for with regards to which hospital to go with as well. The pregnancy journey was very smooth, as we continued to consult her in the clinic ( who would unnecessary \ud83e\uddd0 pay extra to visit the same doc in maternity hospital) and we were blessed with baby girl \ud83e\uddd2\ud83c\udffb.  Although the pregnancy had all green lights for vaginal birth, last moment the decision had to be made to go with caesarean and we are happy with the decision made and have no regrets. Mother and baby both are doing excellent.\n\n@ Dr. Padmapriya: You really are awsome\ud83e\udd29 humanbeing first of all and our experience speaks how good you are as a doctor/surgeon.\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb for all the kind support till now and going forward. We really have become friends now and considered you as a family doctor \ud83d\ude03and not just patients\ud83d\ude09 \n\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Padmapriya definitely \ud83d\udcaf if you want a doctor who connects very strongly with the patient which i feel is a very important characteristic to look for in a doctor by any patient.",

Dr. Padmapriya, Kashyap Women\u2019s Clinic, Rajajinagar, was our gynecologist throughout the pregnancy and for the delivery.\n\nOur first baby suffered from one of the rarest ailments. None of the pre-natal tests had revealed anything. After 2 months, baby had to succumb to the ailment. Moreover, the duration/time gap for the second pregnancy was well below the prescribed duration. So, this pregnancy was very crucial for us and, probably, challenging for gynaecologist also.\n\nDr Padmapriya went through the reports of our previous baby and accordingly, started the treatment. All through 3 trimesters, we were advised with necessary supplements and tests at appropriate intervals. Blood and urine tests were performed at Kashyap Women Clinic itself. Reception and lab staff were cooperative. Hygiene and maintenance was very impressive.\n\nIn addition to ultrasound scans, a few more \u201cspecial screening tests\u201d at multiple institutions had to be done. This was to ensure that the baby is healthy and free from any kind of ailments. Moreover, Dr guided us through Covid vaccination and 3rd Covid wave (Omicron).\n\nIn each consultation, Dr. tried to understand and address our concerns. She listens. Always accessible over the phone. At times, she also had to even counsel us.\n\nDoctor is a visiting/consultant gynaecologist at several hospitals. So, there was flexibility to choose the hospital for delivery. The delivery (c-section) process was planned and coordinated well.\n\nBoth mother and baby are doing good. In summary, we are very happy with our journey under Dr. Padmapriya's guidance. Grateful too. She is experienced, updated and approachable. From our experience, it will be always comforting and relieving when one is under her care.",

I visited Dr.Padmapriya gynaecologist, I told her my issue and she was so pleasantly and patiently listening to mine and gave me few remedies of how I could improve on it.\nWhat happened next was a miracle for me, after a month visit of mine, I tested positive with PREGNANCY \ud83d\ude01, this was such a bliss to me and my family. After all of that I went back to Dr. Padmapriya for my future regular consultations, it was all because of her that made my pregnancy in ease, she was always motivating, being very positive which is really important for any women to be during pregnancy.\nThe next thing was that I wanted her to be there and do my delivery, trust me it was worth and I had a successful delivery.\nAlso to mention the staff there are so cooperative, the maintenance of the environment is really good, they maintain hygiene.\nI had a great  and successful experience.\nI will recommend Kashyap clinic for any women\u2019s issue and also any Orthopaedic problem because even though I haven\u2019t visited Sir, I have seen many visiting him.\nThanks to Dr. Padmapriya and the entire team of Kashyap \ud83d\ude0a.",

There's never been a day when she's not responded to my doubts and queries on Whatsapp and on phone calls! When we were heading close to term, she promptly monitored and On the day of hospitalization, she took special care to ensure I was comfortable at each juncture, when I thought the entire process was overwhelming, she motivated me, gave me a push, encouraged me that I'll be able to deliver baby smoothly.  My husband and I are ever grateful and thankful to her for making this experience so worthwhile. ",
