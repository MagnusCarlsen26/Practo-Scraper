"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"This is the feedback of ""Dr Vijaya Sherbet"" and not ""Columbia asia hospital Hebbal"" in general. She is a senior doctor in Columbia Asia Hebbal branch. I would provide here the honest feedback of this doctor. This is to help others who will face the same circumstances when dealing with her.

We had heard good feedback for her and hence decide to pursue with her. *** ** * ********** **** ****** **** **** ********* ***** ******* ******* *** ************** She will greet you with smile, explain you the tests that needs to be done and medicines to be taken.

However, when the complication arise in the pregnancy then it's hard to get any good explanation of a question. It is also very hard to predict if your pregnancy will develop a complication. Complication can arise anytime. I would STRONGLY SUGGEST you to switch doctor if there is any complication. PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE.

These are the problems you will face with her in complicated pregnancy
1. A complicated pregnancy comes with lot of trauma on parents. They generally have multiple questions. It's very hard to not ask your friends (or google) and clarify with your doctor. Doctor Vijaya doesn't entertain additional questions. She will behave rigidly and would expect you to move along without any queries. In our case, even one query got her irritated. The experience turn sour so quickly that we were not sure what to ask her.

1. She takes thing to heart. ** *** *** ** ***** *********** *** **** *** ********** **** ****** ********* *** *** **** Cross questioning could be simply asking these type of questions: Why are you saying 'something ......', my friend had the same problem but could continue for longer duration before surgery. She doesn't like to be cross questioned or probed for clarification. From this point onwards, her behavior will become rigid towards you.

If you are looking for best gynecologist at North side of Bangalore then Dr Vijaya is the BEST. she is flexible, friendly, approachable and genuine doctor.she knows what patient expect from doctor and she listen to the problem and provide best solution to it.
