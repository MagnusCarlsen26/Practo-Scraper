But as weeks passed I developed a strong trust in Dr Shobana mam.. she is gem of a person and the best Dr. I have ever met.. she addresses each question so patiently and politely and cleared all our doubts during pregnancy..though my 8 months of pregnancy were very smooth  and during 9th month I suffered from bells palsy and she was the one who motivated me and took utmost care of me during that time..she suggested me the next steps and gave me confidence that it will be all fine soon (which actually happened at the end).She was  readily available on calls for any emergency even when she was out of town and also she gave a call from her side to know about  my health and how I was feeling..The trust and respect for Dr. Raman Mam increased to next level when i was in labour room and I have given up twice on normal delivery and requested her for c sec as I was not able to bear the pain.. but only she was the one who motivated me like anything for normal delivery instead of doing c sec.... I saw more than a Dr. in her in the labour room.. more of a mother..more of a friend...just wanted to thank  you enough Dr. through this post..Trust me.. *** ** *** **** *** *** **** **** *****",

Me and wife had started visiting Shobana madam for my wife's first pregnancy in February, and my wife delivered a healthy baby recently in October 2019.\n\nDr Shobana mam really looked into my wife case extremely well, she was always there for my wife's queries and for any emergencies.\nI think it's madam's personal connect and care that helped my wife to recover and heal fast.\n\nMy wife's case was a critical one because of her past medical history, but with Dr. Shobana everything went so perfect, that we have no words to express it.\n\nDr. Shobana mam is so caring and punctual, I remember the night my wife delivered, she went into labour around midnight, we assumed from our past experiences with other doctors that we can go to hospital and doctor will arrive in sometime. We were surprised to see that doctor is there before us and she is eagerly waiting for her patient, to know how is she now?\n\nWe have meet a lot of doctors but with Dr. Shobana everything is so cool and relaxed. \n\nThanks Dr Shobana mam for all your care for my wife and new born. Also, a big thanks to Sir and your team for all the support and care.\n:) :)\n\n",

I saw more than a Dr. in her in the labour room.. more of a mother..more of a friend...just wanted to thank  you enough Dr. through this post..Trust me.. *** ** *** **** *** *** **** **** *****",

Me and wife had started visiting Shobana madam for my wife's first pregnancy in February, and my wife delivered a healthy baby recently in October 2019.\n\nDr Shobana mam really looked into my wife case extremely well, she was always there for my wife's queries and for any emergencies.\nI think it's madam's personal connect and care that helped my wife to recover and heal fast.\n\nMy wife's case was a critical one because of her past medical history, but with Dr. Shobana everything went so perfect, that we have no words to express it.\n\nDr. Shobana mam is so caring and punctual, I remember the night my wife delivered, she went into labour around midnight, we assumed from our past experiences with other doctors that we can go to hospital and doctor will arrive in sometime. We were surprised to see that doctor is there before us and she is eagerly waiting for her patient, to know how is she now?\n\nWe have meet a lot of doctors but with Dr. Shobana everything is so cool and relaxed. \n\nThanks Dr Shobana mam for all your care for my wife and new born. Also, a big thanks to Sir and your team for all the support and care.\n:) :)\n\n",
