Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)

This is Gayathri Pavan,

I recently had the pleasure of being treated by Dr Harini P Shetty (mam) specialised in obstetrician, gynecologist and infertility treatment. As someone who had been struggling with infertility for a while, finding the right healthcare professional was crucial. Fortunately, I found a true gem in my doctor, and I cannot express my gratitude enough for the exceptional care and expertise I received throughout my journey.

From the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming staff that immediately put me at ease. The entire team, from the nurses to the administrative staff, demonstrated a genuine commitment to patient care. They were always attentive, compassionate, and understanding, recognizing the emotional toll that infertility can take on individuals and couples.

My obstetrician and gynecologist stood out as a true expert in the field. Their vast knowledge and experience in infertility treatment were evident from our very first consultation. They took the time to thoroughly explain the various procedures and treatment options available, ensuring that I had a clear understanding of each step along the way. Moreover, they actively listened to my concerns and fears, creating a safe space where I felt comfortable discussing my emotions openly.

Throughout my treatment, my doctor's expertise and professionalism shone through. They employed the latest advancements in reproductive medicine and utilized state-of-the-art equipment and techniques. This not only instilled confidence in the effectiveness of the treatments but also minimized discomfort and stress during the procedures. They were meticulous in their approach, leaving no stone unturned to maximize the chances of success.

What truly sets my obstetrician and gynecologist apart, however, is their unwavering support and empathy. Infertility can be an emotionally taxing journey, and my doctor recognized this. They provided unwavering support, both medically and emotionally, guiding me through the highs and lows with compassion and understanding. Their availability for questions and concerns, even outside of scheduled appointments, was a testament to their dedication to patient care.

I am thrilled to share that, thanks to the exceptional care and expertise of my obstetrician and gynecologist, I am now expecting a child. The joy and gratitude I feel are immeasurable, and I credit my doctor for making this dream a reality.

If you are searching for an obstetrician and gynecologist who specializes in infertility treatment, I wholeheartedly recommend seeking out the services of my doctor. Their exceptional care, expertise, and compassionate approach make them an invaluable asset to anyone navigating the challenging journey of infertility. I am forever grateful for their contributions to my journey towards parenthood, and I have no doubt that they will continue to change lives for the better.

Thank you, Dr. Harini P Shetty, for being the guiding light in my fertility journey and helping make my dreams come true.",2023-05-11 12:14:23,False,True,Prasad,"Thank u Pavan and Gayatri

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I was in need of a right doctor, so was in search of her. We( my husband & I) met many doctors in my home town as well as in Bangaluru. No one was matching me with my emotions. They were all just doctors on duty. Finally, my sis-in-law referred her to me, & with hope I stepped into her hospital clinic. At her first smile itself, I felt comfortable. By then, I had passed month 3. She was so understanding & soft spoken that I felt happy & relieved that this is the Doctor I was looking for. I felt that I can now relax & enjoy my pregnancy. That is how all went on. Month after month passed & my bond with d Doctor grew like a mother & daughter relationship. Every month step by step she was like holding my hand & giving me full moral support to go for a normal delivery inspite of having gestational diabetes. At this point also my doctor encouraged me to go for a sugar free strict diet so that my child & I can have a diabetes less future. Due to this, I used to call her at odd times in d night, but still she was as understanding & soothing as always. Because of her I could cross d hurdles of myg pregnancy with ease. She would always see that I am at comfort due to which my trimesters passed without much fear. She waited for my full term to complete. I did not get d labour pains as it should be, it was just coming & going on & off. She advised us to get admitted as there was no need to wait further since d full term was over. She was always giving me moral support to go for a normal delivery only. I was also mentally prepared for it. I saw a true mother in her. My pains were coming only during d night. Day time I was fine. So, she explained to us d cons & pros & d process of inducing pain. I agreed for it, since that was the best to do at that time. The hospital room  was clean & comfortable. The admin staff & d nursing staff were also very kind & good. All d required tests were done. The next day morning I was shifted to d labour room. There I was induced d pain. By & by, d pains started. And then, it grew so much that I could not tolerate it anymore. There again my doctor gave me full support & helped me to bring my little tot to this beautiful world. Finally, my much desired Normal delivery happened in good health of baby and me. My husband & I were so full of Joy to see our First Born crying.... 😊😅 And at that moment all my pain vanished & I felt that my doctor was not only a true mother in disguise but also a God incarnate to me Forever. 🙏🙇‍♀ My story does not end here. Even after going back home, while we had to go to hospital for d follow-ups, I was unknowingly saying that  ""today we have to go to temple"", rather than say hospital. My family used to get puzzled 😳🤔as to what I am saying ??  For My Son & Me,  'Ovum Hospital' has become a Temple & My doctor, Dr.Harini Shetty has become My God  Incarnate!!

This is when I found Dr. Harini's profile on Practo and decided to meet her. It was one of the best decisions I had taken in my life. It was a joy meeting her. I was quite susprised to find a doctor of her calibre being extremely approachable and I must say she is the sweetest doctor I have interacted with till date. She is extremely knowledgeable and skilled. She heard out all my doubts and anxieties with utmost patience and explained to me in detail of all the possibilities that we had at hand. She did not rule out normal delivery although it seemed difficult.  She was available on WhatsApp and on call despite her busy schedule. On the day of the delivery, when my water broke, doctor told me to immediately get admitted. I was tested positive for Corona, but she and her amazing staff made sure everything went well and that I don't panic. She assured me that she would try for normal delivery as much as possible and finally in 5 hours time I delivered naturally. I would say God answered my prayers through Dr. Harini.

Just in case she is busy or missed your call (which rarely happens), she will give you a call back immediately. At some point she even answered the call during the sleep. 3. Depending on the BMI of the patient, doctor focuses more on Diet. With her guidance, my wife was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy weight gain. With each visit, she used to spend a good portion of time in advising what diet needs to be followed. 4. A Good Listener, she patiently hears all the questions that you have and gives reply after you have completed asking your questions (She does not interrupt you in between). 5. With her gesture and soft spoken nature, you  can ask her all your doubts. she is ready to reply to all of them. She spends a good amount of the consultation time with each patient. There is absolutely no hurry. 6. The care taken by the doctor during the C-Section Procedure was great. Again not in a  hurry, she carefully does the procedure.

The best part of the doctor is that she is available at all the time. She is very knowledgeable, highly experienced and listens to the problem with very patiently and responds accordingly.

On overall journey with Ma'am, she shouted on us once for a good reason. Ma'am suggested to maintain constant weight ( Not to increase weight ), but it did not happened and I put on weight, for this reason she was angry on us. Still we see the care on her angry and we understand Ma'am shouted on us for healthy baby and smooth delivery which is expected too.
