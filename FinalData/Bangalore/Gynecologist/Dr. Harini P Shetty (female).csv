Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)

This is Gayathri Pavan,

I recently had the pleasure of being treated by Dr Harini P Shetty (mam) specialised in obstetrician, gynecologist and infertility treatment. As someone who had been struggling with infertility for a while, finding the right healthcare professional was crucial. Fortunately, I found a true gem in my doctor, and I cannot express my gratitude enough for the exceptional care and expertise I received throughout my journey.

From the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming staff that immediately put me at ease. The entire team, from the nurses to the administrative staff, demonstrated a genuine commitment to patient care. They were always attentive, compassionate, and understanding, recognizing the emotional toll that infertility can take on individuals and couples.

My obstetrician and gynecologist stood out as a true expert in the field. Their vast knowledge and experience in infertility treatment were evident from our very first consultation. They took the time to thoroughly explain the various procedures and treatment options available, ensuring that I had a clear understanding of each step along the way. Moreover, they actively listened to my concerns and fears, creating a safe space where I felt comfortable discussing my emotions openly.

Throughout my treatment, my doctor's expertise and professionalism shone through. They employed the latest advancements in reproductive medicine and utilized state-of-the-art equipment and techniques. This not only instilled confidence in the effectiveness of the treatments but also minimized discomfort and stress during the procedures. They were meticulous in their approach, leaving no stone unturned to maximize the chances of success.

What truly sets my obstetrician and gynecologist apart, however, is their unwavering support and empathy. Infertility can be an emotionally taxing journey, and my doctor recognized this. They provided unwavering support, both medically and emotionally, guiding me through the highs and lows with compassion and understanding. Their availability for questions and concerns, even outside of scheduled appointments, was a testament to their dedication to patient care.

I am thrilled to share that, thanks to the exceptional care and expertise of my obstetrician and gynecologist, I am now expecting a child. The joy and gratitude I feel are immeasurable, and I credit my doctor for making this dream a reality.

If you are searching for an obstetrician and gynecologist who specializes in infertility treatment, I wholeheartedly recommend seeking out the services of my doctor. Their exceptional care, expertise, and compassionate approach make them an invaluable asset to anyone navigating the challenging journey of infertility. I am forever grateful for their contributions to my journey towards parenthood, and I have no doubt that they will continue to change lives for the better.

Thank you, Dr. Harini P Shetty, for being the guiding light in my fertility journey and helping make my dreams come true.",2023-05-11 12:14:23,False,True,Prasad,"Thank u Pavan and Gayatri

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I was in need of a right doctor, so was in search of her. We( my husband & I) met many doctors in my home town as well as in Bangaluru. No one was matching me with my emotions. They were all just doctors on duty. Finally, my sis-in-law referred her to me, & with hope I stepped into her hospital clinic. At her first smile itself, I felt comfortable. By then, I had passed month 3. She was so understanding & soft spoken that I felt happy & relieved that this is the Doctor I was looking for. I felt that I can now relax & enjoy my pregnancy. That is how all went on. Month after month passed & my bond with d Doctor grew like a mother & daughter relationship. Every month step by step she was like holding my hand & giving me full moral support to go for a normal delivery inspite of having gestational diabetes. At this point also my doctor encouraged me to go for a sugar free strict diet so that my child & I can have a diabetes less future. Due to this, I used to call her at odd times in d night, but still she was as understanding & soothing as always. Because of her I could cross d hurdles of myg pregnancy with ease. She would always see that I am at comfort due to which my trimesters passed without much fear. She waited for my full term to complete. I did not get d labour pains as it should be, it was just coming & going on & off. She advised us to get admitted as there was no need to wait further since d full term was over. She was always giving me moral support to go for a normal delivery only. I was also mentally prepared for it. I saw a true mother in her. My pains were coming only during d night. Day time I was fine. So, she explained to us d cons & pros & d process of inducing pain. I agreed for it, since that was the best to do at that time. The hospital room  was clean & comfortable. The admin staff & d nursing staff were also very kind & good. All d required tests were done. The next day morning I was shifted to d labour room. There I was induced d pain. By & by, d pains started. And then, it grew so much that I could not tolerate it anymore. There again my doctor gave me full support & helped me to bring my little tot to this beautiful world. Finally, my much desired Normal delivery happened in good health of baby and me. My husband & I were so full of Joy to see our First Born crying.... 😊😅 And at that moment all my pain vanished & I felt that my doctor was not only a true mother in disguise but also a God incarnate to me Forever. 🙏🙇‍♀ My story does not end here. Even after going back home, while we had to go to hospital for d follow-ups, I was unknowingly saying that  ""today we have to go to temple"", rather than say hospital. My family used to get puzzled 😳🤔as to what I am saying ??  For My Son & Me,  'Ovum Hospital' has become a Temple & My doctor, Dr.Harini Shetty has become My God  Incarnate!!

She is extremely knowledgeable and skilled. She heard out all my doubts and anxieties with utmost patience and explained to me in detail of all the possibilities that we had at hand. She did not rule out normal delivery although it seemed difficult.  She was available on WhatsApp and on call despite her busy schedule. On the day of the delivery, when my water broke, doctor told me to immediately get admitted. I was tested positive for Corona, but she and her amazing staff made sure everything went well and that I don't panic. She assured me that she would try for normal delivery as much as possible and finally in 5 hours time I delivered naturally. I would say God answered my prayers through Dr. Harini.

We started consulting Dr. Harini from our Second Trimester and had a very good experience. Happy to have choosen Dr Harini as our consultant.

Very down to earth person (She is a kid nature, there is absolutely no attitude, such a sweet person), Always with a smile on her face when we enter her room. 2. She shared her mobile number at the first visit itself. We are very happy with the way she answered the calls or a WhatsApp message. She is ready to answer your call anytime. Just in case she is busy or missed your call (which rarely happens), she will give you a call back immediately. At some point she even answered the call during the sleep. 3. Depending on the BMI of the patient, doctor focuses more on Diet. With her guidance, my wife was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy weight gain. With each visit, she used to spend a good portion of time in advising what diet needs to be followed. 4. A Good Listener, she patiently hears all the questions that you have and gives reply after you have completed asking your questions (She does not interrupt you in between). 5. With her gesture and soft spoken nature, you  can ask her all your doubts. she is ready to reply to all of them. She spends a good amount of the consultation time with each patient. There is absolutely no hurry. 6. The care taken by the doctor during the C-Section Procedure was great. Again not in a  hurry, she carefully does the procedure. We did not have any issues in the care provided by the doctor. Thank you Doctor for the care. With that care, my wife was able to walk the next day of C-Section.Thank you Doctor for everything.

Not only, her understanding of Gyne protocol is outstanding, her experience of diagnoses is superb. She knew before hand, what is coming ahead that's the reason she was able to save my pregnancy irrespective of multiple admissions due to one problem or another. We always felt that we are in safe hands. 

I cannot forget the day of my delivery, which was not a planned one. Doctors were on strike and I developed the complication. We called her in late evening, told her about the problem and she was not in hospital. In ten minutes we were in hospital and staff was waiting for us with a stretcher on entrance. As soon as we reached there, all arrangements were already made and in next 15 minutes, Dr. Harini was there. In next 15 minutes, C-section was done. That shows the responsibility that she and her staff owns which is the most important aspect for us. Than baby was born with complications and he had to be in NICU for a long time. Till the time, baby was not discharged, Dr. Harini kept on taking feedback in back-end from Pediatricians, which is another efficient team. We are really thankful to the staff of Ovum hospital, they treated us so well from the time of admission to discharge. They listened to us, understood our point and helped us in every possible way.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr Harini mam for my wife’s pregnancy checkup and delivery (totally 40 weeks). She is dedicated, friendly and caring doctor. She always welcomes us with a smiling face and explains all our queries patiently and in friendly manner. She explains about the diet, do’s and don’ts during the pregnancy and educates us with medical terms. She is such a dedicated doctor that she gives her phone number to the patients and accepts calls anytime on the day.

She remembers patient medical history very well just from the look of the patient. My wife had a white discharge during the pregnancy period which can cause pre-term labor. She diagnosed it on time and treated it with proper care. She advices exercises based on the medical condition of the patients.

Baby weight had grown little more in the 38th week than expected. My wife being short was very difficult to deliver it normally. Even after 39 weeks, my wife did not get any labor pain, so we admitted her in the hospital to apply gel to induce the pain.

Harini mam was constantly examining the cervix space and she got the pain after 24 hours. My wife was very scared of normal delivery, but I insisted her go for normal delivery. My wife could not bear the labor pain and asked for epidural injection. But Harini Mam suggested that she will unnecessarily land up in C-section if we suppress the pain and gave us full support and cooperation. My wife delivered a beautiful boy baby normally after 2 hours of struggle. My wife was not that supportive for normal delivery, but still Harini mam made it possible. Our sincere thanks and greetings to her. My wife had more blood loss than usual. So, she had to stay couple more days in the hospital. She made frequent visits till my wife’s health was normal and took care of her with complete care and affection till the discharge. 

All the duty doctors, nurses and support staffs are very supportive and caring during our stay in the hospital. There were around 4 doctors and 5 nurses at the time of delivery. Our sincere thanks from the bottom of heart to all of them.

We will never forget Harini mam in our life and would definitely recommend the doctor for pregnancy check-up and delivery.

As a first-time parent, we had many doubts and fears which were clarified with lots of patience and promised all the times nothing would happen and she would take care of it.
Throughout the entire pregnancy doctor was continuously monitoring my wife's health by prescribing medicines, taking necessary blood test, scans, advising on food habits & lifestyle, exercises to do. Doctor also referred us to Lamaze classes in ovum.
At 39 weeks, also i did not receive any symptoms of labor and pain, so doctor examined by taking a scan and told to get admitted, so that they can induce pain by applying gel.
I got admitted morning around 6.30 A.M and gel was applied, Labor pain started around 8 a.m. and it was there for almost 2 and half hour. 
As the cervix was thick and contractions dilated only around 2 to 3 centimeters, doctor told we would wait until evening so that cervix becomes soft for head to come out.
Around 8 Pm my water broke and i was shifted to labor room immediately, though i got very good pains and good symptoms of natural delivery, my cervix was still thick and same 2 to 3 cm.
Doctor did not go to home and waited in hospital whole night, she was continuously checking once in 2 hours. Doctor arrived at 4 A.M and determined that I would need a C-Section, as cervix was thick and dilated only 2 to 3 cm and baby would not be able to make the “turn”. Also, due to water break lot of fluids had gone and baby’s heart monitor slipped out of place several times sounding the alarm.
Thank you for recognizing and making us understand that I needed to have an emergency C-Section, your quick decision & analysis of the situation likely saved my life & baby’s. Thanks to anesthesiologist, pediatrics, nurses , ultrasound technicians, laboratory and staff for all your support.
My baby could see the light of the day becoz you kept awake all night for my delivery. Around 4.37 am doctor delivered the baby safely and baby's weight was around 3.44 kg with cord around the neck. 
We can’t ‘thank you’ enough for making our family complete by giving us the little baby joy to our life. Will ever be thankful and grateful towards you.

I consulted Dr Harini for my first pregnancy and for second pregnancy as well. As she is very friendly in nature, approachable and such a down to earth person. With what ever problem we go, I get a lot of confidence as soon as I see the Ma'am itself. The way she listens the problem and the way she responds/explains each and every aspect is remarkable and it helps me in creating a comfort zone.

The best part of the doctor is that she is available at all the time. She is very knowledgeable, highly experienced and listens to the problem with very patiently and responds accordingly.

On overall journey with Ma'am, she shouted on us once for a good reason. Ma'am suggested to maintain constant weight ( Not to increase weight ), but it did not happened and I put on weight, for this reason she was angry on us. Still we see the care on her angry and we understand Ma'am shouted on us for healthy baby and smooth delivery which is expected too.

Now, this is my second pregnancy c-section along with the tubectomy, Which went really well without any issues. I am able to walk comfortably on the 3rd day of c-section itself.

There is no second thought, Overall we had great experience. Once again, Thanks a lot Ma'am for the care and love shown on us on both pregnancies.

It was through the google reviews we found Dr and visited when the pregnancy was confirmed.
Since the beginning we preferred a normal delivery and when we shared this to Dr, she helped us through the diets and necessary exercises. As we neared the due date baby was gaining weight and we decided to get induced at 37 weeks 5 days. 
On the day of induction everything went well and I started getting good contractions but wasn’t dilated beyond 4cm. We waited till next day morning , my water broke but the dilation was still slow. I was not able to bare the pain any further and by noon we had to move ahead with an emergency C Sec. 
We are happy that we chose Dr Harini as it requires one to make a decision at the right time and Dr definitely has the expertise and always makes you comfortable even when there is lot of pressure around.

Delivered a baby boy in 2017 and now blessed with a baby girl (2019).
Both by normal delivery. 1st labor was 3 days long and she patiently stayed until I delivered, which I doubt many wouldn’t consider having so much patience and dedication towards a patient. She’s been an immense support and has always cared like a family. Known her for 4 years now and she’s always available on her personal number regardless of day or time.

Although, I had few scary instances during my pregnancy but her support, treatment and kind words were very supportive. She is very approachable, whenever I called her to discuss any issue she was there with her suggestions. Once I called at 3 AM to report labor pain and she answered my phone call. I always wanted to deliver normally, she stood by with me and extended all possible moral support and to do list. Finally I delivered normally a healthy baby. The team she has of front desk, sisters, scan doctors is really great.

My in laws wanted me to go to native for delivery but mam gave us so much hope that she will do normal delivery and asked me to stay back in Bangalore. When I got admitted in hospital in the night, mam came to check at 2.30PM in the midnight and stayed whole night in the hospital next to my room which was phenomenal and not expected from these days doctors. My parents and my in laws were moved to this. At one stage after my water broke when I had severe pains my mom requested to do C section but mam said "" No, we will do normal delivery"". She followed all protocols perfectly and finally gifted me a beautiful Baby Boy.

We met Harini Shetty in Ovum Hospitals when we were planning for the baby.  She guided us from day 1 with lots of hope and I was able to have the positive result just in first cycle after I met her. I had PCOD, so she took a close monitoring on my follicular scans and prescribed the right ovulation drugs that helped me to get conceived right in the first cycle of the treatment. I had gestational diabetis and thyroid issues. She took care of my medical condition with utmost care. She personally did all the early pregnancy scans by herself and had complete and close monitoring on the baby development.  There were some times in the course of pregnancy that I was on insulin for few days and she asked me to call for every single meal to monitor my sugar levels. She never hesitated to pick up calls and answers any queries offline whenever needed. By 37th week of pregnancy, the scan reports were not pleasing on the amniotic fluid levels, The levels were very low. So she personally did the scan by herself and decided to go on labor on the same day. Here also, we are very much pleased with her approach on the delivery and supporting me to cope with with the pain. I had a normal delivery on June 2016. We heartfully thank her for all the support and guidance.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dear Reader,
It all started on Feb 21st .... Saranya ( my wife) took appointment of Dr. Harini and on 22nd we got the news . Here, most challenging part for us was to decide whether we should continue with her or shd we move to our native as we all know for any pergrent lady first three months is very crucial .
  But, friends I was absolutely right with my decision . Dr. Harini was a class apart. She never treated my wife as patient. She was like a friend. The way she kept us at ease was appreciable. My  wife had urinal infection as well as a small cyst in her stomach but Dr. Harini never made us feel that as a major problem. Even though Dr. Harini was aware that for delivery we would be going to Kerala, she was still the same till end and never hinted or forced us to opt any particular clinic in Bangalore.
Thank you Mam , the medication you gave for the first three months was a saviour . We are blessed with a beautiful angel . 
I strongly recommend all the lovely to be moms to consult Dr. Harini Shetty.

She has lots of patience to listen from the patient and she gives her valuable advice and treatment as required(not unnecessary medication). She had given me her contact number from the first day itself. She has answered every time I have called(even at night 3 O' clock) her regarding any issue. I had gestational diabetics and urine infection issue in my 3rd trimester. She handled my case very well.  On the day of my delivery she waited, motivated and guided me to have a normal delivery (although I was willing to opt for a C section for an easy escape).

She is very caring, nice speaking and very frank ( not tried to hide anything ). Initially we thought she is extra precocious, but understanding the critical pregnancy case for my wife she was handling the case with lot of care. My wife she had a problem of gestational thrombocytopenia, where her platelets count was going down during this time. With the continuous consultation and observation, we were able to make the right level of platelets during her pregnancy.  
Not only that, during the last few weeks of her pregnancy, in 3 days of time her platelets came down from 1.4L to 75K(approx), so she has given a advice to go for surgery ASAP. But prior to the surgery she had consulted senior general physician for opinion. With proper observation and care she has operated my wife and now we are blessed with a baby girl. 

I would really like to thank Dr. Harini mam for this.

Then finally we blessed with baby boy with the proper follow up by Dr. Harini mam even though she is available on phone as well that service is really helped lot at critical time situation.
