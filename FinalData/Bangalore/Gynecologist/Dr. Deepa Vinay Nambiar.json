The best thing is ma'am will be available to her patients all the time ....and responds us we as female she is the complete solution from a baby born to elderly women!! I love her and have huge respect for what ever she is doing also everything falls under budget unless like other doctors the charges are best and reasonable at her clinic . she treats for all women problems or any sort of issues. i have consulted ma'am for pre pregnancy, pregnancy and vaginal infection she is the best I have seen so far and gives complete details about the cause, treatment and precautions need to be taken.she makes us feel comfortable and like a family during treatment and visit thus feels happy visiting ma'am and sharing all the problems openly and comfortably. I have noticed she gives her precious time sometimes even personal time in treating patient and listen to each and every patient very patiently.One of the best doctor i will recommend all the women.",

We visited Dr. Deppa Vinay Nambiar for my pregnancy intial screening and confirmation, from the day one she was very comfortable, friendly & professional.\\nShe used to understand all our concerns and given us a positive response with proper explanations and suggestions even for silly doubts. She will explain everything very clearly about everything.\\nShe has given us very good support and positive strength, and made my pregnancy journey easy and comfortable..\\nDoctor was available on phone even on odd times for any kind of emergencies throughout my pregnancy phases..The best part was she has prepared us for labor room situation by giving us proper counselling about the delivery process few days before due date to make us understand and to be strong and be prepared. Which has helped us a lot. And finally the day has arrived and everything went well as doctor kept on monitored my labor condition though out the night and early morning we had blessed with baby boy with normal delivery because of her continuous support.\\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Deepa.\\nThank you so much Mam, you made my year 2019 & my motherhood journey sweet and memorable..",

During my trimister's my visit was very comfortable. Dr was reachable any time over phone, that was the best part when You have pregnancy related problems to discuss. And then came my final day, labor pain...Dr was very supportive, made us so comfortable, though the last day was very crucial, Dr gave us a chance to  decide about the date and time according to our hindu calendar which we wanted . That was very nice of her and she was our moral support..The day to remember 04/12/22 10.39pm Dr Deepa Vinay Nambiar was there at our service without any objections, that was very kind of her and we are blessed with our baby Girl....\"My world, my life\".                                                                    \n      Thank you Dr Deepa Vinay Nambiar, without your support and guidence this was not possible for me...You gave us best gift of our life, and You Will be remembered throughout my life.....Thank u once again Dr...\ud83d\udc97                                                                 My experience is incomplete without out mentioning Dr Shanthi.

She's very friendly and made sure everything was taken good care of even when she wasn't available. Unlike few other doctors, Dr.Deepa patiently explains the problems the cause the remedies etc.. She gave a nice pre labour counseling which was re-assuring and is keeping us mentally prepared for the D-day. We are waiting for our little bundle of joy in few weeks time.. I will keep you posted about the delivery experience soon.",

I liked her friendliness and was available whenever required over phone or in person. She gives time to her patient, listen to them and gives advice that is best in patients interest. We asked her lots of doubts out of curiosity since this was going to be our first child, but she cleared all of them patiently that made a very satisfying and a joyful nine months journey. On 25th July we were blessed with a baby girl all thanks to Dr. Dipa mam and her guidence.She is the one doctor that I would definitely recommend.\nThank you Dr. Deepa\n\nVinod and Reena",

The best thing is ma'am will be available to her patients all the time ....and responds us we as female she is the complete solution from a baby born to elderly women!! I love her and have huge respect for what ever she is doing also everything falls under budget unless like other doctors the charges are best and reasonable at her clinic . she treats for all women problems or any sort of issues. i have consulted ma'am for pre pregnancy, pregnancy and vaginal infection she is the best I have seen so far and gives complete details about the cause, treatment and precautions need to be taken.she makes us feel comfortable and like a family during treatment and visit thus feels happy visiting ma'am and sharing all the problems openly and comfortably. I have noticed she gives her precious time sometimes even personal time in treating patient and listen to each and every patient very patiently.One of the best doctor i will recommend all the women.",

She will explain everything very clearly about everything.\\nShe has given us very good support and positive strength, and made my pregnancy journey easy and comfortable..\\nDoctor was available on phone even on odd times for any kind of emergencies throughout my pregnancy phases..The best part was she has prepared us for labor room situation by giving us proper counselling about the delivery process few days before due date to make us understand and to be strong and be prepared. Which has helped us a lot. And finally the day has arrived and everything went well as doctor kept on monitored my labor condition though out the night and early morning we had blessed with baby boy with normal delivery because of her continuous support.\\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Deepa.\\nThank you so much Mam, you made my year 2019 & my motherhood journey sweet and memorable..",

During my trimister's my visit was very comfortable. Dr was reachable any time over phone, that was the best part when You have pregnancy related problems to discuss. And then came my final day, labor pain...Dr was very supportive, made us so comfortable, though the last day was very crucial, Dr gave us a chance to  decide about the date and time according to our hindu calendar which we wanted . That was very nice of her and she was our moral support..The day to remember 04/12/22 10.39pm Dr Deepa Vinay Nambiar was there at our service without any objections, that was very kind of her and we are blessed with our baby Girl....\"My world, my life\".                                                                    \n      Thank you Dr Deepa Vinay Nambiar, without your support and guidence this was not possible for me...You gave us best gift of our life, and You Will be remembered throughout my life.....Thank u once again Dr...\ud83d\udc97                                                                 My experience is incomplete without out mentioning Dr Shanthi.

She's very friendly and made sure everything was taken good care of even when she wasn't available. Unlike few other doctors, Dr.Deepa patiently explains the problems the cause the remedies etc.. She gave a nice pre labour counseling which was re-assuring and is keeping us mentally prepared for the D-day. We are waiting for our little bundle of joy in few weeks time.. I will keep you posted about the delivery experience soon.",

During this time it\u2019s not just your partner, family and friends but your gynaecologist who makes this 9 months journey comforting and memorable.\n\nWe consulted Dr Deepa for my first pregnancy after recommendation of a friend and reading reviews about Shanthi women\u2019s health center in google. In addition to a pleasant personality she is very calm and patient while listening to a woman. She understands the restlessness and anxiety of a pregnant woman and answers all the questions that one might have. She explains various aspects in detail about why, when and how certain things should be done that always help to make informed decisions leaving you satisfied. It\u2019s imp to mention that she always explains various options without imposition whether it\u2019s the lab or hospital to be chosen or procedures that one may opt for. \n\nWell we are most happy to have chosen her as our doctor. The lockdown in the year 2020 has been uplifting for us with the blessing of a baby girl in our house. At the end would like to thank Dr Deepa for being there at all times even during the lockdown. \n",
