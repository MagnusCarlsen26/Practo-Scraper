None,"Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"She drove us to our destiny and we are thankful to her :)

Dr Sneha Dhatrak is a wonderful doctor and we highly recommend her as the gynecologist and obstrecian for all.

Girisha is our first baby and like every couple having their first baby, we were equally anxious about the pregnancy process, about our doctor and the support we will receive.

In our first session itself, we realized the doctor is an amazing counselor and gave us practical and handy guidelines for each month of pregnancy. In our every session, beyond prescription and tests, she patiently explained about the pregnancy period, how to avoid misleading information ( as abundantly available on internet) and how to take care of self during the nine months.

She spent enough time with us on every session, patiently answering our questions (even if they were silly ) and remembering to follow-up on her suggestions/advise ( like have you now started drinking more water, more fruits?). We appreciated that our sessions were never rushed through and we came out of the clinic room satisfied and having no questions in mind.

She also took every little observation of ours seriously and never ever admonished them as silly. We felt respected as parents for that.
This is very crucial for the first time parents as they can be paranoid :)

She balances with ease, when the need arises to be assertive or when the need arises to be caring or when need arises to counsel or advise. Kudos to her for that.

During the last nine months we had ups and downs and her mere presence at the hospital was definitely uplifting and strengthening. There was a certain complication regarding baby's health at one time for us at the hospital and we were really tensed and worried. The moment my wife saw her, it was a drastic change in our moods.  We felt that our baby was safe, under her care. That we felt is a mandatory requirement in a doctor and she excels at that.

We are extremely grateful for this kind hearted, patient, vibrant and highly knowledgeable doctor, who also striked a chord with us. 

She was indeed like the driver, who made our journey to our destiny smooth, safe and this first time pregnancy pleasurable and we will ever be grateful to her for that. She indeed drove us to our destiny and what an amazing journey it was.

If our daughter grows up to be like her, we will indeed be very very proud parents.
