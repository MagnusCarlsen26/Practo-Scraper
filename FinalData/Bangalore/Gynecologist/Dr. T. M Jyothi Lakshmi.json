Though I was very well prepared for Normal delivery. They said baby had pooped and hence had to go though c-section. God should answer if this is treated as emergency for the baby, but when they took me to c-section ward and made me wait for almost half an hour with labor pain\u2026 I was 8 cms dilated. Doctor was in her regular consultation room if I was not wrong leaving me with some brothers and sisters in the room. She didn\u2019t  even call out what baby was born. I was suffering with labor pain almost 12 hours and with anesthesia I was eagerly waiting to here if it was a boy/girl. I finally saw my hubby \u201cHe answered my question\u201d.\n\nI had to go through normal pain and due to the foreign equipment\u2019s used during c-section I had an infection for which I consulted her for 3 months to heal.",

But  nothing helped us out. Then after consulting Jyothi Lakshmi mam and under her guidance I conceived. Had great support and timely advise from her. She was a very friendly and cooperative doctor. We delivered a healthy baby under her guidance. Had a very great experience with her throughout my pregnancy. I would recommend her to others as well who are looking for help. Also cloud nine provided good service during my delivery. I would like to thank all the nursing staff who looked after me during my stay in the hospital. Was very much happy and greatfull to all of them who took good care of me.\n",

Though I was very well prepared for Normal delivery. They said baby had pooped and hence had to go though c-section. God should answer if this is treated as emergency for the baby, but when they took me to c-section ward and made me wait for almost half an hour with labor pain\u2026 I was 8 cms dilated. Doctor was in her regular consultation room if I was not wrong leaving me with some brothers and sisters in the room. She didn\u2019t  even call out what baby was born. I was suffering with labor pain almost 12 hours and with anesthesia I was eagerly waiting to here if it was a boy/girl. I finally saw my hubby \u201cHe answered my question\u201d.\n\nI had to go through normal pain and due to the foreign equipment\u2019s used during c-section I had an infection for which I consulted her for 3 months to heal.",

Had consulted Dr.Jyothi Lakshmi mam. She was referred to us by one of our colleague. Since three years of marriage we had taken lots of medication for a child in various hospitals. But  nothing helped us out. Then after consulting Jyothi Lakshmi mam and under her guidance I conceived. Had great support and timely advise from her. She was a very friendly and cooperative doctor. We delivered a healthy baby under her guidance. Had a very great experience with her throughout my pregnancy. I would recommend her to others as well who are looking for help. Also cloud nine provided good service during my delivery. I would like to thank all the nursing staff who looked after me during my stay in the hospital. Was very much happy and greatfull to all of them who took good care of me.\n",

She will never enforce her decision, she will ask us to think and get back to her on the decision we need to take. I had a big fear on Operation theatre, she and her team who were in OT with me made sure my journey of OT is not fearful. I would highly recommend this clinic and doctor to all couples who are looking for a friendly and caring doctor.",

So during the first consulation itself she was very friendly with us and used to explain and answer to questions. During the first consultation mam asked us to undergo few tests , after test I got to know that i am having hormonal imbalances. So currently taking treatment for that with Jyoti lakshmi mam. She will prepare our body for pregnancy.  Unfortunately during my first consultation i was diagnosed with one of the rare case , and that rare case was found by Jyoti lakshmi mam. And she suggested us that we have to go for hymenotomy surgery(minor surgery max of 15 to 30 mins) , Jyoti lakshmi mam only operated it . And now I am normal. The case which was happened to me was  very rarest case . But  with doctor experience  she was able to tackle and operate it successfully.  Now  she is preparing my body to get pregnant.  So i will highly recommend Dr Jyoti Lakshmi.",
