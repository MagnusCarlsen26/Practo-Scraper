The story of a couple who have no kids for 9 Years.
The story of a family who suffered for a long time depriving the joy in their home
The story of a person tested by failures and setbacks.
The story of a Patient supported by brilliant and dedicated professionals of cloud nine.
End with a long-cherished dream.

This is not just feedback I consider myself as an obligation. It’s a great honor and privileged to share my opinion. We find ourselves fortunate to have been associated. it's hard to pick an English word expressing my thankfulness for Doctor. I can't limit myself just saying Thanks and close this Feedback. I don't think I can pay off Doctor's help in my tenure in any manner, but I will grab every opportunity.

As the AGE is advancing, Pressure is mounting drastically. Tried almost everything in the WORLD with a variety of treatments but failed successfully. On the other side, we have all the problems like endometriosis, Hydrosalpinx, Fibroid, and whatnot. It's not quite easy for any doctor to handle such complex cases to bring a solution unless she a great doctor who is highly knowledgeable on their domain with abundant experience. That's Manju Nair. She looks very simple but a Giant on infertility treatments with her miraculous hand. it's challenging for any doctor to derive a solution in such complex cases with all these multiple problems. She breaks all the barriers and opened each tangle nicely with her patent protocols. Simply a woman with mission. 

Before I approached Manju Doctor, I had done a thorough investigation for a long time and received 100% positive feedback and considered my last destination afterward. She is not just a doctor who merely treats their patients but also a great solution to your potential problem. What a sense of fulfilment and culmination at the end. Every moment of joy we experience today is because of the Doctor. I don’t know where we would be without her.

I still remember one day Madam was a bit emotional and I was deeply touched by her determination to see me as a parent. Madam knew everything about her Patients and emotional bonding is established at the moment you meet her and do not forget that Madam is masters in memory management. Trust me there would not be any failure once you are in the capable hands of Doctor Manju Nair.

Amazing staff with a high tolerance of people, to name a few… Kavitha & Veera & Soumya sisters. What wonderful persons they are with high commitment values. I would say They are the real assets for any organization to Grow. We appreciate cloud nine for deputing such a motivated expert workforce.

Last but not least, Cloudnine has done its excellence with a generous mix of both technology and clinical expertise to ensure that all their customers have an exquisite, safe and joyous experience in this beautiful journey. ",2021-05-11 18:20:08,False,True,Rajesh,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We had been trying to conceive since 6 years.

This suggestion of wrong diagnosis caused us so much of mental agony and anxiety.  We got to know about Dr.Manju Nair and decided to consult her. During our initial visit her assistant took all our details, noted down all the important points.

There is an old saying that ""Doctors are second to God on this earth"". 
The said became true when we meat Dr Manju Nair and the team at Cloud Nine, Fertility Cetnre in OAR. Thank you would be very small for the miracle that Manju madam has given us.
Our infertility journey was long of more than 5 yrears. During these struggling years, we lost hope. After meeting with Manju Madam and the team, the impossible word in our life became possible. She is such a busy doctor handling so many patients still she shared her number with and took time to respond to our queries over whatsapp. She will never suggest for any unnecessary tests unless it's very much required.
She knows what are the doubts most patients deal with and she will clear them all before even you ask her. She not only makes us feel comfortable with her friendly approach but gives us a clear direction on the way forward.
The entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. She has an excellent team of embryologists and they gave us regular progress updates without follow up. Her team of nurses and assistants are always well briefed by her for all critical steps for her patients. Now, with her blessings and support, My wife is pregnant of 3 months.

"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Female Infertility Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We finally got the right doctor after a lot of struggle, Dr. Manju Nair. We conceived in the first attempt with her, despite my earlier 3 failed IVF. We are obviously very happy. But my feedback here is factual so that it's helpful for people like us. We didn't get the information without the unpleasant experience
She is very professional and thorough doctor. In the first meeting itself we told her that time is crucial for us as we had already wasted a lot of time. She explained us that the process with her will have to be step wise, but promised us that we will conceive within this year (it was June'2020) and it happened :)
We had seen 3 other hospitals and doctors. They were either experimenting with us or were new in the field. We wasted money, efforts and most importantly time.
Our experience with Dr Manju Nair was fabulous. Firstly she wouldn't proceed further if she has doubts about the body preparation, (which lacked at other places, as they gave extra medicines to compensate for it) Secondly, for fertility the embryologist team plays a very important role. Dr Nair does only blastocyst transfer that was another factor which gave us confidence. She has an excellent team of embryologists and they gave us regular progress updates without follow up. Her team of nurses and assistants are always well briefed by her for all critical steps for her patients. I would get calls to initiate the injection and scans if those were the deciding factors for the next step
Our FET procedure was smooth. The briefing for medicines and other instructions was done well right after. Infact, my injections and medicines were also optimal. (Unlike in my experience in other hospitals)

"Treatment satisfaction,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Manju Nair, a very blessed person from God,  to do wonders in many couples life especially in my life during infinite struggles, depression, failures, wasting money , time un necessarily with other places and unwanted treatments. In my personal experience which I wanted to share, I was actually undergoing treatments in various hospitals and with different doctors. Nothing worked out, after sometime I even tried Homeo and Siddha for a change but everything went in vain for almost 09 years of all treatment. Later I was referred to Dr.Manju Nair through someone.  Dr.Manju Nair a person with  very Pure Soul , Very kind heart , helping , caring , Friendly, very Supportive , Positive vibes, right Guidance in all the ways like diet , reducing weight , Counseling and bring our mind to the positive side. I can say more than us she belived in her service and treatment to give success and make us parents to see us happy with kids. And that happened, Yes we were a proud Parents for a cute twins after 09 years of Marriage from now.  I really didn’t know a Doctor can bring so much good thing and add happiness in someone’s life especially mine. I really fascinate a doctor’s profession looking at her service and dedication to work she shows. I can also say my wish is to make my Kids also to become like Dr.Manju Nair and serve for the society and for the people who were going through tough and difficulty times in their personal life. A life is not meant only for family, money, entertainment, luxury life, personal goals etc… A life is meant for doing good things to people and for the coming younger Generations.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Mere words don't do justice to the wonderful person that Dr. Manju Nair is! She not only makes you feel comfortable with her friendly approach but gives you a clear direction on the way forward. It is never a monologue with her and she always involves your views and opinion at every step. 

She has seen it all but still makes you feel genuinely special and your concerns important. She is direct and transparent in her treatment methods, feedback, and outcome with no false promises or sugar-coating. Despite a hectic continuous barrage of patients and procedures, Dr. Manju never fails to greet you with a genuine smile.

What is most important during this treatment phase is patience and persistence which she always advises. It is amazing how she remembers the case & status of every single patient even after several months. When we visited her, we had no issues with fertility but possible age factors prevented pregnancies from going through. She was hand-holding us throughout the phase and the never-give-up attitude from both the doctor and our side is the reason why my pregnancy went through dispute phases where hope was almost lost.

Another major + point is that for every small query/concern we need not rush to the hospital because Dr. Manju or the nursing staff would quickly clarify this via WhatsApp or phone call. This is such a boon because other hospitals would ask you to email the query or visit them and pay consulting fee just to ask the doctor about some reaction to a particular medicine!

Due to high demand and morning IUI procedures, it is often that you have 15-45mins of waiting time beyond your schedule. So please plan the visit duration accordingly. If one can not have the patience to wait for a consultation, it makes the entire journey even more stressful.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,Value for money,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"The moment I entered Dr. Manju’s clinic , the place had so many positive vibes .. A vibe that Miracles do happen and this is the place ! Dr. Manju is rare combination of assertiveness, *** ***** ********** skills, positivity , patience , confidence and Magic in her hands! 
This place has made our dream come true . 
With the history of 3 problematic pregnancies( 1 chemical , 2 ectopics - one ended up in emergency surgery ) , I was dreadful at the thought of pregnancy itself. But maternal instincts in a women are stronger than her fear for her life .  After a period of recuperation,  I gathered my strength and decided to visit cloud nine fertility. It’s  only after I entered  the clinic , I realised I am not alone. I the met  doctor and she was so positive and confident  that she assured me that everything will be fine.
And then my IVF journey started ! What an amazing journey it was!  Dr. Manju first put me on diet which I followed and lost 3 kgs in months ( I have been struggling with weight issues and never lost a single inch  inspite of trying hard previously )
Then the process of IVF itself was very meticulous one. Very close and regular evaluation of the growth of follicles was performed by doctor Manju. The entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. Also the Anesthesiologist,  *************  ** ***** **** *** *** **** ******* *** *** best at their work . Dr. Manju’s  team of sisters ( Kavitha , Soumya, Nethra , Jaya and Rosy) are very patient ,empathetic and professional . They know in and out of the process  and will make sure every treatment happens on the stipulated time .The lady help  inside of OT ( I am not aware of her name ) Is a very kind women  too. With the team’s dedicated efforts,  I am now in the  second month pregnancy. Dr took extra care to ensure that all was well this time. No words can express our gratitude towards her. 
In all, Dr Manju is the best doctor. She is an angel to all aspiring parents. Just trust her blindly , you won’t be disappointed. . 
If you are  still anxious, my only advice is : 
Keep Calm! It’s  Dr. Manju Nair !

We highly recommend Dr. Manju Nair and the extremely friendly nursing & front-desk staff who were all supportive during the whole journey.  We are grateful to have found such a wonderful person and support staff at Cloud 9 OAR center Bangalore",2021-11-29 14:26:46,False,True,Sapna Iyer,,,

A vibe that Miracles do happen and this is the place ! Dr. Manju is rare combination of assertiveness, *** ***** ********** skills, positivity , patience , confidence and Magic in her hands! 
This place has made our dream come true . 
With the history of 3 problematic pregnancies( 1 chemical , 2 ectopics - one ended up in emergency surgery ) , I was dreadful at the thought of pregnancy itself. But maternal instincts in a women are stronger than her fear for her life .  After a period of recuperation,  I gathered my strength and decided to visit cloud nine fertility. It’s  only after I entered  the clinic , I realised I am not alone. I the met  doctor and she was so positive and confident  that she assured me that everything will be fine.
And then my IVF journey started ! What an amazing journey it was!  Dr. Manju first put me on diet which I followed and lost 3 kgs in months ( I have been struggling with weight issues and never lost a single inch  inspite of trying hard previously )
Then the process of IVF itself was very meticulous one. Very close and regular evaluation of the growth of follicles was performed by doctor Manju. The entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. Also the Anesthesiologist,  *************  ** ***** **** *** *** **** ******* *** *** best at their work . Dr. Manju’s  team of sisters ( Kavitha , Soumya, Nethra , Jaya and Rosy) are very patient ,empathetic and professional . They know in and out of the process  and will make sure every treatment happens on the stipulated time .The lady help  inside of OT ( I am not aware of her name ) Is a very kind women  too. With the team’s dedicated efforts,  I am now in the  second month pregnancy. Dr took extra care to ensure that all was well this time. No words can express our gratitude towards her. 
In all, Dr Manju is the best doctor. She is an angel to all aspiring parents. Just trust her blindly , you won’t be disappointed. . 
If you are  still anxious, my only advice is : 
Keep Calm! It’s  Dr. Manju Nair !

I still remember our first visit with Dr Manju - she came across as a strict, get to the point person who we weren't sure we'd consult again. So so glad we did however, since now we consider her a friend, not just a doctor while having the highest regard for her professional skills!

We decided to have kids very late in life (I'm 38 and my husband 40) and decided on interventions since our few months of seriously trying ourselves didn't yeild results, our initial test reports weren't great and we didn't want to wait longer. Dr Manju expertly guided us through various procedures in a manner which was stress free while still getting us the ultimate result of this gorgeious lil kid in our lives now!

We read randomly and research a lot and would go to her with our half baked information, which she always patiently listened to, was aware of the various new trends and would explain the details, probabilities, as well as possible options for us. She would also respond on what's app and always remembered our case and preferences. I love how she tailored her approach from initially telling us the best course of action to also giving us options late with her recommendations realizing that we were the kind of people who wanted to feel in control.

She's got a great staff too - Priya at HRBR reception and Nurse Mira and Kalpana at Airport road branch really stood out, though they were all great!

I did have one hiccup where one injection made a muscle numb for a while, which is rare as I understand, though Dr Manju anticipated and guided it's recovery also! It's just been fabulous to have been in her care!",2020-07-24 08:49:57,False,True,shikha,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF),",0,0,YES,"Before meeting Dr. Manju our struggle to have a baby went on for 6 years where we consulted many doctors. These years comprised of multiple expensive tests with no specific fertility diagnosis. We underwent 6 rounds of clomid cycles , 5 IUI rounds at 3 different clinics and one egg retrieval and one frozen IVF cycle. With no success, we came to Bengaluru to shortlist an IVF clinic where we would want to try our next IVF cycle. We met multiple doctors who gave us very complicated options to IVF like fibroid surgery before IVF, 3 months of heavy medication before IVF, repeating all the previously conducted tests, hysteroscopy etc. I was also advised to leave my job by one of the doctors.

However, with Dr. Manju it was very different. She was very patient and studied our medical reports in detail and told us that since we had already done extensive tests in the last one-year, repeating most of them was not required. She also suggested against any fibroid removal surgery. She detailed out the steps required to do the IVF (egg retrieval and frozen embryo transfer cycle in our case) and how we could plan our India trips without me having to leave my job.

Dr Manju and her nurses were very kind and empathetic during the entire IVF process. From registration, meeting the doctor, collecting medicines at the pharmacy and injection administration – everything is well planned and smooth. All members of the team talk to you very patiently and answer any questions you have. Just talking to them gives you a lot of positivity and hope. DR. Manju’s confidence calmed my nerves on the crucial day of egg retrieval and embryo transfer. 

Our IVF cycle was successful and we now have a 5-month-old boy. This seemed like a far-fetched dream before we met her. We were in touch with Dr. Manju during the entire pregnancy and she was kind enough to answer our doubts and eliminate our fears. 

We highly recommend Dr. Manju and Cloud 9 at Old Airport Road. The entire team is very professional and we never felt being forced to go for unnecessary medication or procedures. ",2020-05-24 03:15:16,False,True,Shilpi,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"With previous failed IUI and IVF attempts at other locations, I met with Dr Manju Nair with a lot of fear. She immediately connected with my position and asked me to take a break for couple of months and come back in January. I followed as she suggested and consulted her back in January this year. She immediately recognized me and remembered my condition even before looking at the file. My husband and I were super impressed. 

Then started the IVF journey. Having had similar treatments in other places, I immediately noticed how her regimen is different. She uses a lot less medication and her approach is very positive. She was with me every step of the way and answered all the concerns of my over protective family members. We were able to retrieve healthy number of eggs and decided we would do frozen egg transfer. 

After strictly following the protocol, we transferred 2 eggs. My husband and I decided to go for two eggs because of previous failures. She supported our decision. Once the eggs were transferred, the dreaded two week wait started. But Dr Manju Nair was 100% sure that we would get a positive result. I was so scared of a negative result that I did not test at home. We went to Cloudnine on the assigned day for the blood test. We wanted to hear whatever news from the doctor herself. And when she opened the result it was more than good. The numbers looked excellent. My husband cried inconsolably in the doctors room and she couldn’t stop smiling.  Few weeks later at my ultrasound we discovered that we are having twins!!! Both the eggs struck!! 

Earlier, when people used to say that doctors are gods I never used to relate. But that day I realized that it is indeed true. They can grant us boons which is beyond any human’s capabilities. Dr Manju Nair is one such person in my life whom I can never forget. Not just because she gave us the best gift of our lives but also because she is kind, caring, patient, ************* *** loving. She is more than a doctor. She is a companion in this process. Thank You!!!!",2020-04-28 14:26:39,False,True,Divya D,,,

I tried for follicular study for a year ,took break,  again I went for a follicular study for a year, took break, later I went with IUI cycle, but no luck,  we again took a break and tried naturally.
- We did not have any health problem and all reports turned out to be normal, thyroid levels, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy , AMH levels everything was perfect and normal. Since I had a firm belief on natural way of conceiving, I stopped all medicines and started doing a strict diet and tried the natural medicines. 
- But luck was not on our side and we had lost all hopes. Now we were left with IVF as the only option. I feared for failures and hence kept on postponing it. As we were running out of time and age was catching up, we decided to go for IVF. We got reference of Dr.Manju nair by cloud 9 hospital. We went to her based on the reviews and started consulting her, we had to travel more than a hour to reach the hospital. But it was all worth it. But we never know that god would send us a beautiful angel in the form of Dr Manju Nair, who has a miracle in her hand.
- If you want miracles to happen  and have a happy life, you have to start consulting Dr Manju Nair. Completely we believed in her treatment, she never suggests unneccessary tests.She gave us a patient listening.
- Her time management is just fantastic, hardly you wait for longer times, I used to very easily have the treatment early in the morning and go back to my work.
- The hospital does not have any feel like that of a hospital, it feels like you are at home, which is very important during this tough time. All staffs, nurses everyone are very caring and considerate towards you.
- They have excellent atmosphere where you sure to get positive vibes. Not expecting too much, I was normal and not thinking much of the IVF cycle, just believed the doctor and god sent angel.
- Now what to say my IVF cycle was success and I am conceived. This is a very big achievement in my life since this was my very first pregnancy after long wait...Through out my IVF cycle I did not feel any pain, it's all because of Dr manju nair, never thought IVF was just so easy one to go ahead, which I feared all these years. My eggs were frozen and it is just injected at right time, everything was painless procedures. 
- Timing , medication and  decision making are so important in IVF cycles,  Dr manju nair is a perfect person to trust and has very high success rate. I highly recommend anyone to have treatment under Dr Manju nair and wish you all your dreams come true.
- Thanks again Dr maju nair from bottom of my heart. She has played a very important role in getting me out of despair. 3 cheers to Manju Nair.",2020-06-15 15:15:52,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

It would be an understatement to say that infertility is the single hardest battle any couple may face together, and every step of the way feels unfair. Ours was no different. When we met Dr. Manju Nair, we carried with us the baggage of a failed IVF cycle, broken trust with the previous doctor, and a barrage of unanswered questions. Having all the money in the world is insufficient when the inability to understand the root cause of constant failure is beyond comprehension.

Our journey with Dr. Manju started with renewed hope, and to cut the long story short, we were in the process of discovering new challenges that we had to face with a brave face – low AMH, DOR, MFI, to name a few. We were persistent and visited month after month, hoping one cycle would be the golden one. A major thing in our case was we learnt advocating for ourselves over time. Dr. Manju suggested lifestyle changes, exercise, and patience as the key. For us, it was her reassurance and confidence that mattered. And then, there we had it – just one embryo waiting to get transferred. We took a break for a few months before the transfer and met Dr. again. All the suggested lifestyle changes helped me have good endometrial lining, but was it enough? In my husband’s words, a thousand things must come together for a cycle to work. To be honest, we went ahead with limited expectations and all our trust on Dr. Manju’s shoulders. You see, when you have just one embryo in the basket, that’s all you can do! The dreadful 2-week wait began, and we followed the doctor’s words like a bible, took medicines on time, and prayed endlessly for the dreadful two years to end with a miracle. On the 13th day, I had the moment we were waiting for years - got a positive UPT, followed by a consistent rise in HCG. Today, it’s surreal that I am sitting five months pregnant.

If you are someone who is going through infertility, with a myriad of complications, I see you. In fact, I am you. Please trust Dr. Manju. There will be times when you may question everything, but when you feel like giving up, look up to her. We are 'pregnant' with our precious baby solely because of her treatment. Remember, she is my second doctor, and I regret not meeting her earlier. After struggling for 2-2.5 years, we are where we are today because of her. Thank you, Doc; we owe it all to you.

It is a silent battle and after few unsuccessful attempts - all the hopes and excitement turn into anxiety and stress. My husband and I visited Manju ma'am after not being able to conceive for almost an year.

She truly knows her job and explained her methods in the first meeting . It took us another year for us to be finally pregnant, but throughout this journey I felt that we could not have been in better hands. She is truly the best out there - not just in terms of competence but also her friendly and straightforward nature. She will not build false hopes, but she will empathize with you and counsel you. Also - she does not force any decisions on her patients and after presenting all the options - she asks us to make an informed decision which I truly appreciate.
She has given us the biggest blessing of our life. We have been blessed with a baby girl last month and words are not enough to express our gratitude for her. I truly believe that God works through her hands.

Dr Manju was able to help me understand why that cycle failed and to recommend the appropriate treatment protocol for me. I could not have asked for a better doctor. Her team at Cloudnine is amazing. The nurses are professional and caring. Even the anaesthesiologist for the procedures was fantastic. I was nervous about the anaesthesia procedure for the egg retrieval and she spent extra time in the Operation Theatre explaining the process to me and ensuring that it was a relaxed, calm environment for me. With Dr Manju Nair and her team, you are surrounded by the care of people who treat you like a whole person, not just a file number or a billing ID. If you are struggling with infertility issues, just close your eyes and trust what Dr Nair says. That’s what my friend had suggested to me and it is so true. I wish I had consulted her sooner.

More than a doctor, she is our best companion who took us through the beautiful journey of pregnancy and next is the state of parenthood (expecting on Aug2020).

An amazing doctor with a fabulous team of nurses made us felt we are special and privileged.
It's just not only us but we felt the same kind of treatment for any person/couple who undergoes treatment there.

More than the technicalities of the treatment it is the confidence and perseverance. Not only that her persistence made us confident but made us mentally prepared for the course of treatment.

Yes, we went through multiple IUI cycles and ended up being pregnant with IVF ICSI. It may look like a template but ideally differ for each persona and couple but it is just the mere professionalism and the commitment of her being available to your queries at odd times makes you feel you are at the right hands and right place.

It's an awesome experience for us. Words can never describe for anyone who struggles to get what is once consider very obvious and natural, becoming a mother, a parent. 

We are so happy that this experience came in through a qualified professional with a personal touch to make you feel you are not one in the crowd.

I remember once she was too sick for a week or so and not taking any break and continuing consultation and procedures..she seemed more bothered about my treatment than her health when I asked about her health, she is very punctual too, some days you reach hospital very early in the morning like 6.30 and think you are the first one to reach then you see her slowly walking out of her cabin...it is rare to see such blessed souls.

In first visit itself she has encourage us a lot and filled our mind with positive wibes which is very much necessary, since we are already aware that only option left with us is IVF. She took the time to explain the process to us and to set a plan that we all are comfortable with. In just a few short months you didn't just give us hope, you gave us the results! I appreciate all that you have done, now my wife is 8-weeks pregnant. It is time for my wife to transfer to another doctor for further pregnancy treatment. 

Support from the sisters and other staff is appreciable. They are very well experienced and good at their work.  Additional thanks to Sister and Nurses who handled my injection phobic wife very patiently.

The charges mention during our first visit and what we have paid during our entire process does not differ much which is very good thing.

In closing, We will miss you and your staff. Your help to so many women throughout the year is inspiring. We only wish, if we have came to you earlier. You became more than a doctor, you are a friend and guardian. My wife and I are so thankful for your guidance, wisdom and friendship!

Unlike other doctors, she has her own style to analyse the problems and is very confident with her approach and treatment methods.She  never demands any unnecessary tests and has her unique nursing staff team with rich knowledge. The best part of Manju Nair is her availability around the clock. I hardly see such doctor's availability over WhatsApp and in-time response to keep patients connected.Not sure if she really finds time to even sleep as she is always reachable and we used to receive responses  early morning at 4.00AM too.Her dedication & commitment is commendable ! Another best part which is really overwhelming is her personal follow-ups with maternity doctor( Manjula Deepak) after the handover for pregnancy.She gives importance to each and every patient with the same attention. Her success is evident from her appreciations wall with loads of good wishes. With the blessings of God and Manjula Nair we are blessed with baby girl.

Well all I can say, in our first visit itself we were pretty confident that we are in good hands.Ma'am tried to evaluate us with all tests, but it was really frustrating for us when without a known reason we were not able to conceive. With Maam's constant advise, I was even able to get my weight down from 81 kgs to 52 kgs.After 2 failed natural cycles, 3 Failed IUI cycles, Ma'am advised for more advanced treatment. I had complete faith in her, and said yes for IVF.To our surprise, during ovulation induction, it was found I was a poor responder for the IVf injections. But I still remember Ma'am saying 'leave it on me, you just relax'. That gave another hope and we just went on.Though our numbers were very less, but Maam's confidence for getting a positive pregnancy helped us move forward.Then it was d day for our first pregnancy test, and we couldn't control our tears when we saw positive result. We almost waited for 2.5 years to see this result and due to Manju Ma'am we were able to see this. She is not just an amazing doctor, but a very positive soul.

We had already consulted at least 3-4 renowned doctors  in Bangalore without any success during this timeframe. After two failed IUIs our last doctor suggested a surgical scan to my wife which involved some surgical procedure to check for the cause. We were worried to get under the knife just for a diagnosis & decided not to go for it. Then we met Dr Manju & we were very pleased in the very first interaction with her. She tried to understand our history, tests done so far, all past consultations etc. She asked for some additional tests & was able to point the problem in first few weeks only. She referred me to an andrologist & after few visits to him we were complete with all diagnostics. It was time for decision & she very clearly articulated the solutions with the result timeframe & then asked us to take the decision. Given the situation with my sperm shape &  mortality, the options for us were either a surgery for me or IVF.(That surgical scan suggested by previous doctor wasn’t required at all).  We went for IVF as per her suggestion & it was a success. It sounded unbelievable to us when pregnancy test showed positive.  Our baby is almost four months old now. When I look back, it was a struggle for almost 3 years visiting different doctors, waiting long hours and undergoing scans. It is indeed very painful visiting doctors undergoing different scans, procedures( we had two unsuccessful IUIs before, one  test for fallopian tube blockage) & still neither success nor a proper diagnosis for the problem could be found. I wish we had met Dr Manju in the first place itself.
Best part about Dr Manju is her friendliness, approachability, positivity & tell it like it is attitude. She will boost you, give hope & not give any false promises.

None,"Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Undergoing fertility treatments, especially IVF can take an incredible toll(physical, emotional and financial) on patients. It is a very trying period and we were lucky to be under Dr Manju Nair's excellent care. She is a highly competent doctor, a thorough professional and most of all a wonderful person. We had 2 failed IUI cycles before moving on to IVF, which was successful in the first attempt. Dr Manju Nair, embryologist Dr Sapna, nurses and support staff were excellent. Forever grateful to them, for the most precious gift of a miracle baby, which make the hardships totally worth it. I missed Dr Manju Nair after being transferred to my obstetrician after 6-7 weeks of pregnancy. 

Areas of improvement - 1] Wish there was a dedicated nurse who is at the clinic by 7 AM for injections. This would save some commute time in Bangalore.
2] Would be nice to have two sperm transfers per IUI cycle. Even if it increases the chance of conception by 1%, I would go for it.
3] More comprehensive tests to check for male infertility from day one. This is a common phenomenon across fertility clinics. There is slightly more focus on female infertility initially.

Dr Manju and sister kavita gave me confidence at every step and enquired regularly about baby. Now finally I have completed 14 weeks and all is well.
