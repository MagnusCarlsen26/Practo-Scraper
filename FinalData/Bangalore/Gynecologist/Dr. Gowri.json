I have a PCOD problem since 15 years and cosulted various doctors across the states and almost every one prescribed me with high dosage of medicines which lead to side effects and i bloated too much. Finally i thought of consulting this doctor and went up to her and this happened before my marriage, i told her entire my history of medical treated in the past 15 years and she just wrote in prescription paper mentioning one metabolic tablet to increase metabolism. Ans she all told is that the table she is giving me is to support metabolism and she do not have to give me a treatment for my problem rather she asked me to reduce weigh by going to gym and yoga and diet for 3 months and asked me to consult her after 3 month with weight reduction and i did as she sdai, i went to yoga, joined gym and started diet but did not lose much weight in kilos but really impacted so much that i was regulaired with period and got married and concieved withing 3 months os my my marriage and post which i consulter her for delivery too and she really patietly handled for the noise i made throughout my deliver and gifted with lovely son. So guys with this am sure you should ahve understood that this Dr is not the one who beats around your bush. she is not the one who gives you to much of medicind and make you effected to side effect and she is very natural and you cam rely her 100%.\n\nThanks and Kudo to you Dr.",

She is not in favor of writing unnecessary tests and make huge bills, she recommends tests which she feels are highly necessary. She follows step by step approach in diagnosing the problem which makes her a perfect doctor. And instead of giving huge amount of medicines she emphasizes on eating lot of green vegetables and fruits in normal diet which out-stands her from the rest of doctors in the community.",

Though we were in Motherhood, Indiranagar for 3 days, as advised by Dr. Gowri, she did not visit us for 2 days. 3rd day she came and advised multiple scans. We went to another  hospital where the 1st delivery happened and came to know about the risk which I had in the initial stages.  Moreover, when I settled all the bills on the previous day evening to go to another hospital on the next day morning, the staff nurses were on night duty did not visit/attend me for the baby's health check up though I have requested multiple times.

I have a PCOD problem since 15 years and cosulted various doctors across the states and almost every one prescribed me with high dosage of medicines which lead to side effects and i bloated too much. Finally i thought of consulting this doctor and went up to her and this happened before my marriage, i told her entire my history of medical treated in the past 15 years and she just wrote in prescription paper mentioning one metabolic tablet to increase metabolism. Ans she all told is that the table she is giving me is to support metabolism and she do not have to give me a treatment for my problem rather she asked me to reduce weigh by going to gym and yoga and diet for 3 months and asked me to consult her after 3 month with weight reduction and i did as she sdai, i went to yoga, joined gym and started diet but did not lose much weight in kilos but really impacted so much that i was regulaired with period and got married and concieved withing 3 months os my my marriage and post which i consulter her for delivery too and she really patietly handled for the noise i made throughout my deliver and gifted with lovely son. So guys with this am sure you should ahve understood that this Dr is not the one who beats around your bush. she is not the one who gives you to much of medicind and make you effected to side effect and she is very natural and you cam rely her 100%.\n\nThanks and Kudo to you Dr.",

At 7th month, sudden things have happened like less blood circulation, less growth/oxygen, and sudden delivery happened in some other hospital. Though we were in Motherhood, Indiranagar for 3 days, as advised by Dr. Gowri, she did not visit us for 2 days. 3rd day she came and advised multiple scans. We went to another  hospital where the 1st delivery happened and came to know about the risk which I had in the initial stages.  Moreover, when I settled all the bills on the previous day evening to go to another hospital on the next day morning, the staff nurses were on night duty did not visit/attend me for the baby's health check up though I have requested multiple times. They said, any how you are going to the some other hospital, they will do the require test. ",
