I saw her for  some some sort of treatment.I saw her for routine checkups. She is excellent in all ways: intelligent, kind, patient, and very skilled in the exam. She really knows what she is doing and does it with a minimum of discomfort to the patient.She should train legions to follow in her footsteps.\n\nGenuinely caring person, very knowledgeable and professional. I can't think of anybody with whom I can discuss so easily all my concerns and worries. She is very sympathetic and gets excited together with me looking at the ultrasound pictures. I feel lucky to have found her.She is a great doctor. I was so happy when I found her.She is near to my place too so its easy to visit her when required. only the concern is some time there is high crowd that time you have to wait for long time.",

We were forced to wait for a long period.\n\nThe consultation fee online was 400 INR, but when we visit clinic doctor charges 500 INR. This consultation fee is really very expensive. Added to this whatever procedures are performed at the clinic and whatever charges are taken, they wont give a single receipt to us. All are hand written receipts. Which wont be of use.\n\nThey have a good staff and clinical environment too. Doctor is experienced enough to listen to the problems and analyse the same and help patients solve them at quickly. Doctor prescribed a set of medicines to my wife. After completion of the course of medicines my wife got cured and we are happy with the doctor treatment.\n\nIt would be better if waiting time and fee is reduced a bit and if they give printed receipts.",

There was no consent.

The doctor pressurised to get an elective c section to be done in week 37 and the reason given to me was that in corona, they don\u2019t want to wait for natural labour pain to start. And in case I opt for normal delivery, and if the pains can start anytime, they will deliver my baby in the covid section of Apollo hospital Bannerghatta even though I would be covid negative.

In our first visit we were waiting for thirty minutes, later in follow up appointments the waiting period increased to one hour and sometimes more than that.\n\nThough the doctor is good the nursing staff whom seems to be old enough is not at all good. She is very careless in performing procedures. We once went to doctor's own clinic (MN Speciality Clinic) to inject drips to my wife as she was suffering from weakness. The nursing staff at the clinic injected so hard that my wife got hurt because of that and the wound went on for many days.\n\nJust because of this we never go to doctor's clinic, instead we go to other places where the same doctor practices. We visit same doctor at different places just because doctor is very good.\n\nAlso the consultation fee which doctor charges is very high and it might me difficult for middle class people afford the same.\n\n\n",

I had a very bad experience over there. I took appointment for 7.30 PM slot but i was treated by 9.15 PM. When i visited the clinic there were female who were 4 months 6 months and 8 months carrying. A man whose wife was carrying around 8 months was waiting from around 4 PM, he repeatedly asked the doctor to take them on priority, still doctor nor the staff cared about the mother. She never cares her patients.\n\nWhen it comes to my issue, i had problems with my regular periods, doctor did not even listen to my problem, she randomly prescribed me few medicines, which were too expensive. Her consultation fee (500 INR ) is also too high, added to this no receipt was given for the same. The tablets (which very high dosage tablets) were prescribed for a period of 10 days.\n\nAfter consuming tablets for 2 days i was feeling very uneasy in my health. Hence i consulted another doctor who suggested me to stop the intake of those tablets as they were not the right tablets that should be prescribed for my problem.\n\nI had checked on internet about my issue, all i got was in such case doctor should perform blood test for thyroid or hemoglobin imbalance or scanning to for other issue, than only they should prescribe the tablets, but nothing like that was done by the doctor. She blindly prescribed tablets.",

We have been getting all the scans/tests done as per their suggestion, costing more than 30-40K. My wife had a family function to attend and hence she went to get a medical certificate from Dr. Mala so that she can fly. Her pregnancy is only 25 weeks old, still, we thought it would be better to get a medical certificate. They have been telling us that everything is normal, except that Placenta placement being low (which she said would adjust during the course of time). On being told she needs to fly, everything changed and they started saying the situation is serious and hence we cant advise her to fly etc. Maybe she thought we are taking her to some other hospital at our native place for treatment, which they want to discourage. Because of this, we had to look at other gynaec at the last moment. ***** **** *** *** *** **** *** **** ** ************** ****** ******* **** ***** ************* *** ******* ****** ** ******** ********* **** ** ***** ******** Due to her rude behavior, Apollo hospital is going to lose one family as a customer from now onwards.",

She was so nice, calming and was able to answer all my questions. I was put at total ease and Dr Mala Prakash told me she would even inform me about a  single thing about my treatment. she was so kind to me.\n\nDr Mala prakash was by far the best gynecologist I ever had. I saw her for  some some sort of treatment.I saw her for routine checkups. She is excellent in all ways: intelligent, kind, patient, and very skilled in the exam. She really knows what she is doing and does it with a minimum of discomfort to the patient.She should train legions to follow in her footsteps.\n\nGenuinely caring person, very knowledgeable and professional. I can't think of anybody with whom I can discuss so easily all my concerns and worries. She is very sympathetic and gets excited together with me looking at the ultrasound pictures. I feel lucky to have found her.She is a great doctor. I was so happy when I found her.She is near to my place too so its easy to visit her when required. only the concern is some time there is high crowd that time you have to wait for long time.",

We took appointment for 6 PM slot and when we reached there clinical staff said that the doctor visits clinic only after 7.30 PM. We were forced to wait for a long period.\n\nThe consultation fee online was 400 INR, but when we visit clinic doctor charges 500 INR. This consultation fee is really very expensive. Added to this whatever procedures are performed at the clinic and whatever charges are taken, they wont give a single receipt to us. All are hand written receipts. Which wont be of use.\n\nThey have a good staff and clinical environment too. Doctor is experienced enough to listen to the problems and analyse the same and help patients solve them at quickly. Doctor prescribed a set of medicines to my wife. After completion of the course of medicines my wife got cured and we are happy with the doctor treatment.\n\nIt would be better if waiting time and fee is reduced a bit and if they give printed receipts.",

And in case I opt for normal delivery, and if the pains can start anytime, they will deliver my baby in the covid section of Apollo hospital Bannerghatta even though I would be covid negative.

In our first visit we were waiting for thirty minutes, later in follow up appointments the waiting period increased to one hour and sometimes more than that.\n\nThough the doctor is good the nursing staff whom seems to be old enough is not at all good. She is very careless in performing procedures. We once went to doctor's own clinic (MN Speciality Clinic) to inject drips to my wife as she was suffering from weakness. The nursing staff at the clinic injected so hard that my wife got hurt because of that and the wound went on for many days.\n\nJust because of this we never go to doctor's clinic, instead we go to other places where the same doctor practices. We visit same doctor at different places just because doctor is very good.\n\nAlso the consultation fee which doctor charges is very high and it might me difficult for middle class people afford the same.\n\n\n",

Her consultation fee (500 INR ) is also too high, added to this no receipt was given for the same. The tablets (which very high dosage tablets) were prescribed for a period of 10 days.\n\nAfter consuming tablets for 2 days i was feeling very uneasy in my health. Hence i consulted another doctor who suggested me to stop the intake of those tablets as they were not the right tablets that should be prescribed for my problem.\n\nI had checked on internet about my issue, all i got was in such case doctor should perform blood test for thyroid or hemoglobin imbalance or scanning to for other issue, than only they should prescribe the tablets, but nothing like that was done by the doctor.

They have been telling us that everything is normal, except that Placenta placement being low (which she said would adjust during the course of time). On being told she needs to fly, everything changed and they started saying the situation is serious and hence we cant advise her to fly etc. Maybe she thought we are taking her to some other hospital at our native place for treatment, which they want to discourage. Because of this, we had to look at other gynaec at the last moment. ***** **** *** *** *** **** *** **** ** ************** ****** ******* **** ***** ************* *** ******* ****** ** ******** ********* **** ** ***** ******** Due to her rude behavior, Apollo hospital is going to lose one family as a customer from now onwards.",

I would definitely recommend her.\n\nI really cannot say enough good things about Dr.Mala prakash.  She was SO patient with all of my many questions and actually seemed eager to answer them (as opposed to some other doctors in my past.)  As far as she was examining me for my problem, well that was as quick and painless as it gets.  I have had a condition for sometime which, despite much research on  my part, hasn't been entirely clear to me.  Dr. Mala Prakash explained everything and left me feeling very empowered.\n\nAs far as the clinic staff goes - they were fine. It was a bit of a wait though. I must rate the non-medical staff; I would say that they are just fine. They do their jobs.",

In consultation and treatment she is very experienced , sincere and professional. I was visited to her for two to three weeks and she has proscribed me few medications also . those medications did good work for me.The clinic itself has the pharmacy it self and patients use to purchase the medicines form there only.\nMy only concern i that they charge five hundred rupees consultation fee and i had done with urine test also so one hundred and fifty rupees i have paid extra so according to me there can be some negotiation for consultation fee if the patient is on follow up with the doctor. Otherwise every thing was good there. Clinic was cleanly maintained .\n\nOther vise i was incredibly impressed with her kind, courteous and approachable professionalism.  I am so very happy to have found such wonderful doctors. I know this will be a relationship of trust. Dr. Mala is  truly the most amazing doctor out there she is extremely patient, knowledgeable and kind.\n",

We were adviced for IVF. At every point you are given all available options and also told about the probability and risks. This is something I respect a lot in mam. No false hopes and you are told things as it is. \nLuckily by God's grace and mam's treatment we got pregnant.  Last June delivered a baby girl.  Thanks a lot for this precious gift for our lifetime mam. You are always in our prayers. ",
