"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Endometriosis,Infertility,",0,0,YES,"My emotional journey towards Motherhood!!Hope is the only thing stronger than Fear""Never give up on dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it""Our journey of trying to conceive started in 2009 (after 3 years of Marriage). Failed to conceive naturally without any luck.  I was diagnosed with fibroids and underwent a Laparoscopic surgery in 2010 to remove it and correct the adhesions. After that, we tried to conceive naturally again with no success. We had to shift to different clinic nearby home by end of 2010 to avoid too much of travelling. As per Dr’s suggestion went through 3 cycles of IUI before going for IVF in 2012. First Embryo transfer failed, eventually 2nd Embryo Transfer was positive, however the happiness was short lived, because I miscarried at 8 weeks and the doctor said it was due to UTI. We were devasted at this point, had lost hope...our energy, patience, mental & physical stability...everything was drained. The Doctor also did not give us any hope. We started focusing on our career, betterment of personal life.Restarted the journey in 2019. Upon our own research consulted Dr. Divyashree at Milann Hospital.  We could feel the positive vibe and encouragement in our first meet itself.  I had to undergo another laparoscopic surgery due to severe stage 4 Endometriosis and Adenomyosis before 2nd IVF attempt, unfortunately IVF cycle was unsuccessful.  We moved to Genea Clinic when Dr. Divyashree started of her own to begin our 2 half of the journey.At Genea we tried 4 IVF non-stop cycles including the pandemic period in a span of 4 years (5 failed Embryo Transfers, 2 cancelled Embryo transfer due to embryo not turning into Blastocyst and 1 Embryo transfer turned into twin conception).  After failure of 3 cycles & the required surgeries/procedures, we weren’t in a good position to continue & lost hope and financially drained.  After few days we were called upon to meet Dr. Divyashree and the Dr. persuaded us to try one last time, for which we are grateful for her generosity and her level of personal attention towards us.We didn’t want to disappoint her and went ahead with the suggested plan and ET was done with 2 embryos with no expectations whatsoever.  To our surprise, miracle happened with twin conception on 14th Jun 2023.  We & everyone at Genea were equally happy and celebrating our success.  Dr. Divyashree was triumphant & very happy, emotional at the same time.  We are so lucky that Genea family was with us in every step, situation. Dr. Divyashree & Dr. Chaithra took very good care of me because of the complication and suggested we have frequent scans to closely monitor.  At 9th week scan we got to know that one of the twin heartbeat had stopped and the other was healthy, hence I was closely monitored from then.  Unfortunately, the 2nd baby's growth was restricted at 18 weeks due to placental problem and preeclampsia.  Dr. Divyashree and Dr. Chaithra suggested to do a blood test to see the level of risk I was in before continuing and the risk was reported as too high to continue and my BP was shooting up despite of medication. With heavy heart Dr. Chaithra suggested we have to terminate the pregnancy before I get into severe risk. We terminated the pregnancy on Oct 13th and lost our baby girl.  This emotional & painful journey of 14 years (with 3 major laparoscopic surgeries, 3 minor procedures, 3 IUIs, & 6 IVF cycles) ended at Motherhood Hospital!Even though we could not take our bundle of joy home, we are writing this to urge other couples who are trying to conceive, that always have patience. Infertility treatment and IVF is not an easy journey as you all know...but with patience, hope, healthy eating habits, yoga, meditation, you can make it an easy process.  When we saw frequent failures, we made up our mind and was always prepared for any outcome. That’s when the pain of failure did not affect us too much every single time and we were ready for the next round in no time.  We have no guilt or regrets as we always felt that we went to the right Doctor. I have seen many patients who have conceived naturally, first time in IUI, first cycle of ivf.  Dr. Divyashree is an expert who diagnoses your issues and suggests the right kind of treatment. I have gone to different hospitals, different doctors, but never met anyone like her. Kind and compassionate, professional and always eager to help all the patients. I definitely did not feel like she was my doctor. She was always like a close friend taking care of us in every step and always gave us hope. She explained all the procedures, technicalities even before we had a doubt. Dr. Chaithra was also very helpful and supportive throughout my pregnancy and especially during the termination process. She herself followed up every few hours due to my condition.My husband and myself could go through this long and tough journey and would like to recommend these learnings to all the couples going through this journey:1. Have Patience... It is the key to success2. Never lose Hope3. Have Faith and trust in yourself (very important), in your doctors. Especially Doctor like Dr. Divyashree and her team, they will always guide to the right path4. Don’t Stress too much... Practice yoga, meditation, have healthy eating habits (which will help to improve your health and chances)5. DO NOT delay your treatment6. Trust yourself and the processWe would whole heartedly thank Dr. Divyashree, Dr. Chaithra, Dr. Rashmi, Mr. Hemanth, Mr. Nandish & all the staffs of Genea (to name a few: Bhagya, Preethi, Ashwini, Arjun, Gowdru, Sindhu, Vishalu, Bhanu, Suma, Asha etc….) who are very kind and helpful, we will always recommend them to other patients.Wishing Genea team all the success in fulfilling every couple's dream of becoming parents!",2023-11-06 07:01:22,False,True,Shambavi Ashok,,,

First day of my step to Genea fertility motivated with the caption and  now ended with ""YES"" after 6 1/2 years of my marriage and longstanding wait for my dream come true. 

Entered the Genea fertility centre with so many hurdles (Low AMH and one tube blocked) at the age of 32.

First meet was with Dr Divyasree and she explained us the importance of IVF in our case and took our case in her hands.

My first cycle of IVF got failed. But we had a faith on our doctor and moved in the path laid by her... She never and ever made us discouraged and was very positive in our case... One good thing observed is Dr Divya sree never handed over any case to any of her staff.. She personally takes care of each and every case.. 

With all the prayers and blessings of family, well wishers and specially fertility centre staff I have succeeded in 2nd cycle.. 

I sincerely thank Dr Divya sree, Dr Jhansi, Dr Chaitra,Dr Poonam for making me comfortable throughout the journey in Genea Fertility... Despite of having loosing hopes in each every stage of my life they have made my Dream come true. 

Special mention about the staff (Asha,Namratha,Naveena and Dhanu) who are exceptionally freindly, co-operative and kind. Never ever felt that they are just a staff over there. But they made me so comfortable in my journey in the fertility centre by responding  and clarifying my endless doubts.. 

Thank you Genea...will be indebted to you in my whole life

But because for various reasons, she was unavailable and we had to start consulting with another Doctor. 
As fate would have it, after going back to Dr Divyasree for consultation again, we are now blessed with a baby girl. 
After having consulted in a MultiChain IVF center, initial visits to Genea were a totally different experience and we were starting to have doubts. But all those doubts were put to rest later. 
To all future parents, Genea is driven by team of passionate ""All Rounders"" headed by Dr Divyasree herself. Given the multiple roles each of the Team members handles, it will take some waiting, but it's worth it. 

So After 7 years of trying with failed attempts of IVF earlier due to various reasons [ Covid, Still growth] we had almost lost all hope when we went to Dr.Divyasree. She took up our case as a challenge and challenged her team as well to have this case a Success. 
When Dr.Divyasree said that it's her gut feeling that all the parameters are looking good and we shall try IVF again, we ourselves didn't have any hope left, but we blindly trusted her and went ahead which gifted us parenthood today. 
Dr.Divyasree has immense memory, despite seeing so many patients, she remembers the details of each of the patient and keeps following up on them.
Dr.Divyasree , Dr.Rashmi, Dr. Nandini Patil, and Dr.Chaitra with smiles on their face, were always making us feel positive and provided great support. To put it in a word they were ""BINDAAS"". The conversations used to be Friendly than like a typical ""Dr and Patient"" 
All the doctors were available whenever we required their help and moreover they were very transparent in explaining all the details/risks.  
Dr. Rashmi and Dr. Chaitra - with their expertise helped us to overcome a few complexities.  

Ashwini, Sindhu, Arjun, Preeti, Bhanu, Suma, Asha, and all the other staff at Genea are amazingly friendly, they made us feel comfortable. This is what sets them apart from the Multichain Clinics. The personal touch. 

Thank You Team Genea.

To All aspiring parents, No treatment is 100% Success. It needs lots of Patience and Perseverance. Dont lose hope and Trust the Doctors.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Infertility,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my experience of three years of infertility treatment. I had conceived in 2016 but unfortunately it was an ectopic pregnancy and I partially lost my right fallopian tube during the surgery. After that my struggle to conceive began! We tried to conceive again but it didn't happen. Our doctor then put me on medication to ovulate but most of my cycles got cancelled as I mostly ovulated from the right. After numerous cycles got cancelled, our doctor suggested us to go for IUI with injections. After bearing the pain of injections for two cycles, we still didn't get positive result. It was a stressful period for us as we had already lost two years trying. Our doctor then suggested us to go for IVF. We then approached Dr.Divyashree Ma'am of Milann and went to meet her (May 2018) to discuss our case for IVF. She was very clear and explained us the next course of action to be taken. She suggested us to undergo few tests and to try for two cycles of IUI. The IUI cycles didn't result in positive and then we decided to move to IVF. The next three cycles we couldn't start with the IVF process as my hormones weren't on the expected range. Finally on December 2018, my IVF cycle started but as I had overstimulated, the embryos were frozen. In January, we went for FET and transferred two 8 cell embryo but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be positive!  The failure of FET shattered us both emotionally n physically but Ma'am motivated us n asked us to go for next cycle. We then went for next cycle of FET but before the transfer could happen, I started bleeding n thus my cycle got cancelled. We were then suggested to go for blastocyst transfer in the next cycle. Unfortunately, none of the embryos developed to blastocyst on the day of transfer and again the cycle got cancelled. I started with the medicine to induce periods n then I get a call from the hospital that one of the embryos have made it to the blastocyst stage (it was a slow developing blastocyst). As I had already started with the medicine, the blastocyst was frozen for the next cycle. In the next cycle, our last set of embryos were used and luckily one of them made it to the blastocyst stage. So the two blastocyst were transferred on May 2019 and after a long wait of 3 years we got a positive result on June 2019 and a healthy baby boy was on born January 2020. We would like to thank Dr. Divyashree Ma'am for encouraging us, motivating us, guiding us and helping us in completing our family. Ma'am your advice ""Worrying will not help!"" always helped me in overcoming my stress during this tough journey. We would also like to thank all the junior doctors especially Dr.Shravya for always answering our queries n clearing out doubts. Lastly, I would like to recommend Dr.Divyashree to all the couples who wants to complete their family! Her diagnosis is very apt and explains the further treatment very clearly.

Unfortunately, none of the embryos developed to blastocyst on the day of transfer and again the cycle got cancelled. I started with the medicine to induce periods n then I get a call from the hospital that one of the embryos have made it to the blastocyst stage (it was a slow developing blastocyst). As I had already started with the medicine, the blastocyst was frozen for the next cycle. In the next cycle, our last set of embryos were used and luckily one of them made it to the blastocyst stage. So the two blastocyst were transferred on May 2019 and after a long wait of 3 years we got a positive result on June 2019 and a healthy baby boy was on born January 2020. We would like to thank Dr. Divyashree Ma'am for encouraging us, motivating us, guiding us and helping us in completing our family. Ma'am your advice ""Worrying will not help!"" always helped me in overcoming my stress during this tough journey. We would also like to thank all the junior doctors especially Dr.Shravya for always answering our queries n clearing out doubts. Lastly, I would like to recommend Dr.Divyashree to all the couples who wants to complete their family! Her diagnosis is very apt and explains the further treatment very clearly.
