At that time we were trying to conceive and already met 3-4 Doctors from very renowned hospitals for simple consultation, most of them were quite negative.Then I spoke to Dr. Sunitha about the same, she was so positive and asked us to just go for some basic tests and the results were favourable. In a few months only I conceived naturally and finally went to her clinic. Trust me, she is the best in her field. First of all she is really very positive. She won't ask you to take unnecessary supplements or medicines. She will motivate you,  won't frighten you for being pregnant at a later age (I was 34 when I conceived and other doctors whom I met earlier when I was 32-33 were so negative on this). My pregnancy was a cakewalk under her hands. And she has some aura that I used to be very excited for my visits to her. She will patiently listen to you, will answer every query no matter how small it is. The only thing I didn't like about her is that she doesn't do the delivery. I really wanted her to bring my child into this world.  But she referred us to another Doctor in Aster CMI who was equally good. Even after my delivery I simply visited her and she answered more vividlyfor all my queries than my baby's pediatrician ( You know a new mom has so many doubts).Even her staff is so nice. The girl who used to take blood samples will do in such a manner that you won't feel any pain.I have so much to say about her.*** ** ****** *** ***** She is an angel rather. Thanku Sunitha Mam.",

At that time we were trying to conceive and already met 3-4 Doctors from very renowned hospitals for simple consultation, most of them were quite negative.Then I spoke to Dr. Sunitha about the same, she was so positive and asked us to just go for some basic tests and the results were favourable. In a few months only I conceived naturally and finally went to her clinic. Trust me, she is the best in her field. First of all she is really very positive. She won't ask you to take unnecessary supplements or medicines. She will motivate you,  won't frighten you for being pregnant at a later age (I was 34 when I conceived and other doctors whom I met earlier when I was 32-33 were so negative on this). My pregnancy was a cakewalk under her hands. And she has some aura that I used to be very excited for my visits to her. She will patiently listen to you, will answer every query no matter how small it is. The only thing I didn't like about her is that she doesn't do the delivery. I really wanted her to bring my child into this world.  But she referred us to another Doctor in Aster CMI who was equally good. Even after my delivery I simply visited her and she answered more vividlyfor all my queries than my baby's pediatrician ( You know a new mom has so many doubts).Even her staff is so nice. The girl who used to take blood samples will do in such a manner that you won't feel any pain.I have so much to say about her.*** ** ****** *** ***** She is an angel rather. Thanku Sunitha Mam.",

She is such a wonderful doctor and compassionate human being, surprisingly I got conceived in my first cycle of treatment only with minimal medicines and appropriate guidance by the doctor. She has so much authority and indepth knowledge of the subject that makes everything looks so simple. Thoroughly enjoying my motherhood journey and tender loving care from Dr. Sunitha in my precious pregnancy. Thank you so much Dr. Sunitha mam\ud83d\ude4f",
