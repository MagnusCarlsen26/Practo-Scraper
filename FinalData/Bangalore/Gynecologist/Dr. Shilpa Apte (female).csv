,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Shilpa Apte has been great to work with through the course of our pregnancy. We had an ectopic pregnancy which Dr. Apte successfully managed medically with no complications. A few months later, we got pregnant and throughout the pregnancy, Dr. Apte was very particular about consistent testing for both the mother and child to ensure the pregnancy is progressing well. After going for induced labor and not seeing enough progress, we opted for C-Section. Dr. Apte was prompt and made herself available right away and helped deliver our wonderful baby girl. I would highly recommend Dr. Apte for any OBGYN related issues/concerns/consultation.",2021-01-30 07:03:21,False,True,Avinash Najat,,,
