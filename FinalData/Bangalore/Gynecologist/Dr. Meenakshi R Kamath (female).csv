In fact we had visited Cloud nine for our first delivery as well, but since we were completely dissatisfied with the earlier doctor (Not naming the doctor due to goodwill), we wanted to have a better experience and thus Dr.Meenakshi Kamat happened.

From day 1 of visiting her, she took utmost care of me. I in fact had a low placenta issue which is usually high-risk pregnancy care but without scaring me or my husband, she took us through the precautions to be taken care since the first tri-mester until I actually delivered.

Dr.Meenakshi is always patient, polite, humble and very social. She takes the extra step to know about the family and understand us better to suggest better food options and medicines that are compatible and palatable:) She always takes time to talk, socialize, examine and provides proper feedback and information.

Even if there are things that could be potentially complex topics, she takes the time to explain in an understandable manner and until we get it. My son who was 5 years when we started visiting her in fact became very friendly towards the end because of the rapport the doctor established.

She is always smiling and never in a hurry or showed frustration for any reason on me (patient) even though her day might be bad. She handles pressure so cool and calm and we really liked the whole experience with her.

When the final D-day came, (MIne was a C-section due to the low placenta issue and the first delivery was a C-section as well) she handled the whole delivery so well and even the post-pregnancy care was well managed.
