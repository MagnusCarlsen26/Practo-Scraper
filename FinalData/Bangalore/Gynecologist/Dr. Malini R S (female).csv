"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cervical Cerclage,Pregnancy Check Up,Fertility Treatment,Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We have been visiting Dr. Malini since past 3 years after I had a PPROM in 2020. She helped us stay calm and composed with her extremely positive attitude and gave us every minute detail about my condition throughout the time we were trying to conceive, while I was pregnant and finally she helped me deliver our beautiful baby this June. 

As it is very important to be patient, calm and positive while a couple is trying to conceive, Dr. Malini guides you with her experience and very minimal medicinal support. She believes in keeping things mostly natural rather than making the patient eat a lot of medicines. Hence, I could also conceive naturally and not go through IVF and other processes. She is very supportive over emergency calls, messages and makes herself available to attend to your medical needs.

We both strongly recommend her for people who want to have a happy conception and pregnancy journey.",2023-08-01 11:16:57,False,True,Shriti Saha,,,
