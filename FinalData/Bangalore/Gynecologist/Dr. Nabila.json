Our story is big, but let me make the long story shor...We travelled from US to India in August 2021 and my wife was 28 weeks, while in US we had been going to the best of Ohio health hospitals Women Physicians in OBGYN and Riverside Methodist Hospital in Dublin, Columbus city in Ohio USA. After staying so long in US and used to the best of medical services, the only concern me and my wife Faiza were having was to find matching counterparts here in India. We were lucky to have found the best bet in Dr. Nabila Rahman to continue to support us through our journey of becoming parents again :).The best part was, we consulted her from US itself before we travelled to India and she made us feel at ease and coordinated with our USA Gynecologist and helped us continue rest of our treatments and took care of our pregnancy and final C-Section surgery at Ovum hospital in Bangalore last week. Though there were couple initial concerns we had in US with early pregnancy scanning reports indicating marginal cord insertion, Dr. Nabila helped us gain confidence by paying keen attention to successive timely scanning reports and guided us with her best advises until our pregnancy successfully completed. Do not want to miss the point that she possesses best of the interpersonal and communication skills and very down to earth and more over she is very approachable, responds to  SMS, Whatsapp messages in case of urgent needs and even if we need any minor clarifications pre and post-delivery. The fact that she can be consulted in multiple hospitals including Ovum, Motherhood and Cloud nine chain of hospitals makes it even more easier and hassle-free to book an appointment at a convenient time. Me and my wife Faiza wish her from the bottom of our heart for her obliging, kind and cooperative services and wish her progressively increasing advancements in her career. Thank you - Arshad & Faiza",

The journey of pregnancy is bit scary . But caring doctors like you make it friendly and pleasing.  Nine months of our journey could have been a nightmare without your medical supervision. Thanks for making our journey pleasant with nothing less than a dream come true. Good doctors like you replace the Fear of Illness with Trust in Recovery. \n\nThanks a lot :) ",

Our story is big, but let me make the long story shor...We travelled from US to India in August 2021 and my wife was 28 weeks, while in US we had been going to the best of Ohio health hospitals Women Physicians in OBGYN and Riverside Methodist Hospital in Dublin, Columbus city in Ohio USA. After staying so long in US and used to the best of medical services, the only concern me and my wife Faiza were having was to find matching counterparts here in India. We were lucky to have found the best bet in Dr. Nabila Rahman to continue to support us through our journey of becoming parents again :).The best part was, we consulted her from US itself before we travelled to India and she made us feel at ease and coordinated with our USA Gynecologist and helped us continue rest of our treatments and took care of our pregnancy and final C-Section surgery at Ovum hospital in Bangalore last week. Though there were couple initial concerns we had in US with early pregnancy scanning reports indicating marginal cord insertion, Dr. Nabila helped us gain confidence by paying keen attention to successive timely scanning reports and guided us with her best advises until our pregnancy successfully completed. Do not want to miss the point that she possesses best of the interpersonal and communication skills and very down to earth and more over she is very approachable, responds to  SMS, Whatsapp messages in case of urgent needs and even if we need any minor clarifications pre and post-delivery. The fact that she can be consulted in multiple hospitals including Ovum, Motherhood and Cloud nine chain of hospitals makes it even more easier and hassle-free to book an appointment at a convenient time. Me and my wife Faiza wish her from the bottom of our heart for her obliging, kind and cooperative services and wish her progressively increasing advancements in her career. Thank you - Arshad & Faiza",

Thanks for showing us so much care and concern. **** **** * **** ******, I value the fact that you are a good listener. I value the fact that your attitude is exceptional. Thank you. The journey of pregnancy is bit scary . But caring doctors like you make it friendly and pleasing.  Nine months of our journey could have been a nightmare without your medical supervision. Thanks for making our journey pleasant with nothing less than a dream come true. Good doctors like you replace the Fear of Illness with Trust in Recovery. \n\nThanks a lot :) ",
