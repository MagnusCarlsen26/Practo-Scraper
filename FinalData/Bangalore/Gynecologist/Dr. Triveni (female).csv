"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"The Short Review:

Arthur Ward says ""the good teacher explains, the superior teacher demonstrates, and a great teacher inspires"".
Having gone through our experience of pregnancy and delivery, we  want to say, a good gynaec explains your options, the superior gynaec has years of experience and a great gynaec gives you time and the confidence you need to cope with the toughest moments during this journey. 
Dr Triveni was a great gynaec for us. 

It was through reviews like these we decided to consult with her right from the time we decided to conceive last June. We are so glad and thankful to these reviews for guiding us to her and more than grateful to her for making this journey absolutely memorable. 

The Long Review:

Here are just a few anecdotes from our pregnancy and birthing experience with Dr. Triveni: 

Friendly & Approachable: During the 9 months+ of our interaction, we developed a great rapport with her. My wife came to believe in her experience and expertise completely. We were ready to follow her suggestion every step of the way. During labor, there are 100s of things that can go haywire, and having her helped us choose our options wisely. 
 
Gives You Time: During our interactions she patiently took the time to answer each of our questions. (Being first time parents, we did have a lot of questions). Few of our consults took 30+ mins (esp. towards the end of our journey), and she never ended any of these meetings in haste. Whenever we felt that things were getting out of control, she was just a WhatsApp message away. This felt quite reassuring. 

Scientific & Experience-based Advice: Her recommendations on delivery procedures (ex: episiotomy during a normal delivery) and pregnancy practices (ex: supplementation/exercises) are based on scientific trials that are done with Indian women and her past experience. She helped us understand the reasoning behind every single call / suggestion of hers

Tailored Approach - Dr.Triveni is quite perceptive and experienced - she tailored her approach based on things beyond the hospital room too - for example - stuff like my wife's daily physical activity, prior scan and test reports etc.,

Gives you Confidence - At one point when we had almost decided to go the C-route, our doctor's call and faith in my wife helped us to stay the course and finally she had a normal delivery. Having experienced the attitude of other duty doctors first hand, we can't emphasize how important this is. It makes all the difference. 

Apart from our gynaec, we would also like to thank her team of support doctors and experienced nurses (esp. Aniyamma) at Cloudnine who provided us the best care and support before, during and after the birth of our baby. 

For such an important journey in life, we strongly recommend Dr.Triveni and the Cloudnine Team (for their experience and processes). **** *** ****** ***** *** **** ** **********

My wife and I started consulting Triveni Ma'am since October 2021. This was our first pregnancy. Cloudnine SahakarNagar was closest to our house and we booked online to visit.

But after that first consultation till today (July 2022) she has been truly exceptional. We were a demanding client as we are based abroad and only wanted to come to India for 1st trimester and then delivary, she helped us on what's app, answered our calls and was truly present throughout the pregnancy journey. We were blessed with a baby boy on 22/June/2022 and the delivery experience with Triveni Ma'am was also great.
