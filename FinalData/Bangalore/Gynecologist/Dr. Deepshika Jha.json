I got to know that my previous doctor had just closed her hospital and she was away and not meeting any of her patients due to Covid 19, I, infact tried to reach many other doctors in RT Nagar , Bangalore, but everyone was scared to give appointment, all the doctors I spoke were giving online appointment. \n\nAnd in the mean time I came across Dr. Deepshikha Jha, she was the only one who gave me an appointment, she did meet me face to face and got me admitted as I was really not well. \n\nDr. Deepshikha Jha is a very brave and a very responsible Doctor, though the Country was locked down and there was fear of Covid 19 everywhere, she never hesitated to meet me fave to face, She is very friendly and ready to help her patients. Even in the lock down I never had any problem for appointment and regular check ups. \n\nShe is very positive in her nature and also shares lot of positivity with her patients. It helped me a lot to relieve the stress and stay relaxed all the time. \n\nIn case of emergency Dr. Deepshikha Jha was just a call away. \n\nShe is the only doctor I would strongly recommend. \n\nThanks to Dr. Deepshikha Jha.

She speaks Hindi, English and Kannada very fluently and quite aware of the customs and culture of people from different regions and faith. This helps the patient to connect extremely well with her. Her explains things really well and allows ample time to patients to speak. Has a very calm yet energetic attitude. She never wrote any unnecessary tests and always advised right medicines at the right time. Our baby was just 2 kgs end of 8th month. She prescribed some powder and biscuits that helped her gain 800gm in 25 days that was healthy for delivery. Her amazing quality is that she responds our queries on call and WhatsApp and if busy, she will herself call back. After delivery she referred us to an amazing paediatrician who charges not a very high fee. Before I conclude I would like to convey my gratitude for Dr. Deepshikha who helped her get concession on the overall bill because we had already exhausted huge part of corporate insurance during early months of pregnancy by getting hospitalized numerous times under other gynaecologist. \nI would highly recommend Dr. Deepshikha for pregnancy cases especially to Hindi speaking people living in Bangalore.",

I got to know that my previous doctor had just closed her hospital and she was away and not meeting any of her patients due to Covid 19, I, infact tried to reach many other doctors in RT Nagar , Bangalore, but everyone was scared to give appointment, all the doctors I spoke were giving online appointment. \n\nAnd in the mean time I came across Dr. Deepshikha Jha, she was the only one who gave me an appointment, she did meet me face to face and got me admitted as I was really not well. \n\nDr. Deepshikha Jha is a very brave and a very responsible Doctor, though the Country was locked down and there was fear of Covid 19 everywhere, she never hesitated to meet me fave to face, She is very friendly and ready to help her patients. Even in the lock down I never had any problem for appointment and regular check ups. \n\nShe is very positive in her nature and also shares lot of positivity with her patients. It helped me a lot to relieve the stress and stay relaxed all the time. \n\nIn case of emergency Dr. Deepshikha Jha was just a call away. \n\nShe is the only doctor I would strongly recommend. \n\nThanks to Dr. Deepshikha Jha.

She speaks Hindi, English and Kannada very fluently and quite aware of the customs and culture of people from different regions and faith. This helps the patient to connect extremely well with her. Her explains things really well and allows ample time to patients to speak. Has a very calm yet energetic attitude. She never wrote any unnecessary tests and always advised right medicines at the right time. Our baby was just 2 kgs end of 8th month. She prescribed some powder and biscuits that helped her gain 800gm in 25 days that was healthy for delivery. Her amazing quality is that she responds our queries on call and WhatsApp and if busy, she will herself call back. After delivery she referred us to an amazing paediatrician who charges not a very high fee. Before I conclude I would like to convey my gratitude for Dr. Deepshikha who helped her get concession on the overall bill because we had already exhausted huge part of corporate insurance during early months of pregnancy by getting hospitalized numerous times under other gynaecologist. \nI would highly recommend Dr. Deepshikha for pregnancy cases especially to Hindi speaking people living in Bangalore.",
