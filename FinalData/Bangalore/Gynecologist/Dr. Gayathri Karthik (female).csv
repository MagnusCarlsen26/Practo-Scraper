None,None,0,0,NO,"This is a very experienced doctor but she is almost always in the OT and be prepared to wait anywhere from 1-3 hours in the hope she will come back and attend to her patients with “appointments”.  In the instance she is available, she is rushed and will rush you and barely listens to your side of the story so I never  felt comfortable and heard by her at all. The repeated lack of respect for people’s time has put me off and I will never be seeing her again. So if you value your time and need someone who is calm and can give you atleast 10 minutes of attention I would find someone else.",2023-08-17 03:37:07,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
