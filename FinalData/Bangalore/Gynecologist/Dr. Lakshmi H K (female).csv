"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pregnancy,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"Hello,

I strongly recommend Doctor Lakshmi HK.

I visited the Doctor in My First Pregnancy with few unexplained symptoms. Doctor recommended me to perform some important detailed tests to confirm the health condition of the Baby.

I received the test results post 15 days and it was a painful end result for us. I lost the baby because of health conditions in the womb. This moment in our life was very much miserable and difficult to overcome the situation.

Dr. Lakshmi HK was very much encouraging and gave us the hope and belief that this is not the end. We are really grateful for this Doctor. 

Post six months later I was naturally conceived and under the Medications and Moral support of Dr Lakshmi HK everything was fine.

In the 5th month of my pregnancy, based on month on month scans it was identified that I might expect the Pre-Term delivery because of few medical reasons. I and My husband were worried hearing these result.

Dr. Lakshmi HK was on consistently touch with me on Daily basis to confirm the symptoms of the Pregnancy. Also Doctor prescribed a weekly injections until I crossover the risk stage.

Then I successfully crossed the danger zone and delivered a healthy girl baby without any medical complications in Columbia Asia Hebbal.
All this good happened only because of Dr Lakshmi HK, we are blessed to get such a helpful Doctor at the right time.

Now my baby is about 6 months, Me and my husband want to thank Dr Lakshmi HK heart fully.

Thanks for everything Dr. Lakshmi HK, yours Counseling was the best of my life.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Lakshmi during the 3rd month of my wife’s pregnancy , at that time we had recently shifted from Delhi to Bangalore and were not knowing much about the place. We went to her with lot of questions and worries of how thing would move on over the complete period as this was our first child.
She was very patient , calm and friendly answering all our questions and making us understand the complete process in a very simple manner which made us feel quite relaxed and confident.
She has always guided us to go with proper diet, timings of diet , recommended minimal tests and where ever required advised for medications which are required for baby growth and mother’s well being.
We have visited Shanti Multispeciality Clinic multiple times during the tenure even if it is a very small concern. 
Even I have called her late hours of night when we felt something emergency and over phone only she has guided us hearing the symptoms .
Finally with all her help , our family is blessed with the baby girl at Columbia Asia Hebbal , and on the day of delivery she was available through out and with her help , my wife could go for a normal delivery and both mother and child were completely fine after the birth.
I would definitely recommend all who are seeking guidance and looking for expert Gynaecologist to visit Dr. Lakshmi.

For physician consultation also we visit Shanti Multispeciality Clinic and get checked and treated from Dr. Brunda.

Again would like to thank Dr. Lakshmi for all her help and guidance.",2018-01-14 14:43:21,False,True,shubhrajyoti das,,,
