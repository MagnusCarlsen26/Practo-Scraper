"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Normally I don't write feedback on social sites. But here I really want to write about Anitha Ma'am as it might help others.
 We shifted to Bangalore from Delhi six months back and approached almost 5-6 doctors. All were good but we were still skeptical and were not feeling confident. But after meeting Anitha Ma'am for the first time we were sure that we will be in safe hands. She is 10/10 in her work, understanding of new tech and making this journey comfortable. 

My topmost worry has always been that many doctors recommend those treatments which are not required and might harm you in long run. We all know that it's not about money for a patient but the side effects and emotional trauma involved. Also we can't do much about it as we are completely dependent on doctors' advice. But here it was a pleasant surprise to see the other side :)

She will try her best for the normal and painless delivery without any doubt. 

In short, if you are looking for a experienced, cool and genuine doctor then she is the best we have met so far. And in case you also opt her for this most important part of life then one day you will also write such a long feedback like me :)
All the best!
