"Treatment satisfaction,","Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"Met for daughter and wife , she didn‚Äôt prescribed any medicine even patient repeatedly mentioned about weaknesses, And other problem , she insisted for ultrasound and did it. 

The other Serious concern was about Staff Which was highly rude and unprofessional, 

Will never make the visit again ",2020-05-21 04:44:34,False,False,Verified Patient,"Sorry that you had, a bad experience with us..  This is just to clarify that I don't prescribe medicine unnecessarily because all medicine have their own side effects.. So medicine are precribed only when there is a problem.. The symptoms are however clarified and explained. 

Ultrasound is very essential for diagnosis since we can't make out everything by history or examination..  It confirms or rules out a diagnosis..  We can confidently say whether there is problem or not only after ultrasound.. 

In covid times our patient safety is our priority..  We do ask everyone their travel, fever or contact history..  It is a patients civic responsibility to co operate and not consider it staff rudeness.. Also if a patient attender is coughing,  in view of other patients safety we have to ask the attender to wait outside,  that again is not rudeness but out duty towards patient safety..
