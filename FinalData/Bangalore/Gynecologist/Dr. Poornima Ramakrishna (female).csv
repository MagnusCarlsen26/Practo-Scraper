"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"** *** **** *** ** *** ******** I’m writing this review on behalf of my wife Aruna. We met Dr Poornima after referral from one of my friend. We started consulting doctor from the third month of our pregnancy. We were in confusion whether to continue the old doctor or should we consult Dr Poornima. In this dilemma our 3rd month scan got delayed by 2 days. AfTer so much thinking we opted for Dr Poornima. Our first visit she saw our last doctor’s case sheet. And asked our 3rd month scan details, we said we are planing to do it here with you. Doc scolded my wife like anything, literally she made my wife cry. Then she explained both of us how important to do the scans on the exact dates, in particularly the 3rd month scan. I asked my wife due to want continue with this doctor. My wife said I want this Doctor only. After that everything was spl. We enjoyed our parenthood thoroughly. Doctors explains everything. We asked for normal delivery. Doctor supported us so much. My wife was 32 at that time pregnancy and it’s our first baby. Dr Poornima is a strong personality, very strict and informative. If you trust her fully I tell you she will keep up the word what she tells you. No matter what. In the last month doctor gave her personal Whatsapp number too, to be in touch and to answer our doubts. On the delivery day, We went through more than 20 hours of labour. She was monitoring my wife through out the day. My wife couldn’t meet the 10cm opening on the delivery day, doctor being so patiently  waited and waited. If it’s any other doctor they would have performed the C section. Then finally she performed normal delivery to my wife. My baby boy weighted 3.8kg, both mother and baby was healthy. I still remember what doctor said after coming out from the OT Big Baby, and my wife is a strong woman. I should tell you one thing our baby birth happened during the first wave of covid. She has been like a family member when we are in hospital. Once you go to her, trust her fully. You may find her very strict. *** *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** True Doctor.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"This is a long pending feedback. Dr Poornima justifies the profession she is in and really knows what she is doing. What initially seemed like a high risk pregnancy (I was on bed rest for first 3 months due to bleeding) turned out to be a wonderful experience for me with a normal delivery. The reason I decided to consult her is because of her reputation in normal deliveries.
 
I wouldn’t say I started feeling comfortable from day 1. On the day of our first appointment she had to attend to an emergency delivery in Koramangala clinic and she had to rush. She couldn’t spend too much time. I started thinking how can a patient develop comfort with her doc with just one meeting a month which lasts for not more than 10 or 15 minutes. But in the subsequent appointments I realized that she does give time to patient to ask questions, clarify any kind of doubts even if they are silly. She sticks to basics - healthy food and exercise and active life, doesn’t prescribe unnecessary tests or medicines. She suggested me to continue with my work life as it was before my pregnancy without scaring me anytime due to my bleeding in early pregnancy. During my appointment in the 8th month she said “Very high chances of normal delivery” and we were really excited and little nervous also.. On the D day, we went to the hospital and I delivered under her supervision after almost 20+ hours of labour, which today is one of the most cherished and memorable experiences of my life.

If you are cooperative and realistic in your expectations you can expect the same from her. For e.g. – She runs around 2 clinics and sometimes she could be delayed due to delayed delivery or some complications and she is a human. You cannot expect her to reach your clinic on your appointment time.. 

PS – This is a feedback for Dr Poornima and not Apollo Cradle, Jayanagar, where I delivered.",2019-07-18 06:55:22,False,True,Puneetha Chittiyappa,,,

One knows, pregnancy, delivery and post partum can go either way.

No unnecessary scans, she is thorough and precise with her diagnosis and instructions. I delivered my baby in Feb 2021 in the hands of Dr.Poornima Ramakrishna and her able team at Apollo Cradle. Was induced to go into labour as I had dilated few cms but wasn't getting natural contractions, post which delivered vaginally without any tear and gentle suturing.
