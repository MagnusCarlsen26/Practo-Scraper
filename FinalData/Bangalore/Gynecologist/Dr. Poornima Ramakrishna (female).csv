I am updating the review due to the kind of love she has provided during pregnancy. During 2nd trimester my wife diagnosed  with dengu.

And she used to visit twice to see the improvement with the treatment. And i came to know that my baby is in safe hand. 

And during third trimester ,my wife diagnosed with diabetes. Firstly she convinced my wife that nothing can harm you. And she started giving full attention to my wife in every visit. And slowly with proper examination we progressed to the 9th month of pregnancy  . As we were having bad past with normal delivery .We asked doctor for c section. Then she explained us the pros and cons of normal delivery and c section. She clearly told us as normal delivery has various advantage ,i cant ignore it. But she had given us faith that ,in any emergency we will plan for c section. So on the delivery day, due to water leakage we got admitted early .As it was indication of normal delivery pain ,we got admitted early.And we waited for 4 hours for pain to increase as water loss was more and chances of something serious damage was there. As confirmed earlier by the doctor , she would act according to patient conditon. And she  decided for c section. And she has already arranged all experts from hospital as precautions due to past history. And the operation was successful .And she came back with smiley face to inform us the successful delivery of baby.

And i am writing all this to show my gratitude for her. She cared us like her own child from the beginning till end.",2020-01-24 12:42:14,False,True,Vikam Bharti,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"** *** **** *** ** *** ******** I’m writing this review on behalf of my wife Aruna. We met Dr Poornima after referral from one of my friend. We started consulting doctor from the third month of our pregnancy. We were in confusion whether to continue the old doctor or should we consult Dr Poornima. In this dilemma our 3rd month scan got delayed by 2 days. AfTer so much thinking we opted for Dr Poornima. Our first visit she saw our last doctor’s case sheet. And asked our 3rd month scan details, we said we are planing to do it here with you. Doc scolded my wife like anything, literally she made my wife cry. Then she explained both of us how important to do the scans on the exact dates, in particularly the 3rd month scan. I asked my wife due to want continue with this doctor. My wife said I want this Doctor only. After that everything was spl. We enjoyed our parenthood thoroughly. Doctors explains everything. We asked for normal delivery. Doctor supported us so much. My wife was 32 at that time pregnancy and it’s our first baby. Dr Poornima is a strong personality, very strict and informative. If you trust her fully I tell you she will keep up the word what she tells you. No matter what. In the last month doctor gave her personal Whatsapp number too, to be in touch and to answer our doubts. On the delivery day, We went through more than 20 hours of labour. She was monitoring my wife through out the day. My wife couldn’t meet the 10cm opening on the delivery day, doctor being so patiently  waited and waited. If it’s any other doctor they would have performed the C section. Then finally she performed normal delivery to my wife. My baby boy weighted 3.8kg, both mother and baby was healthy. I still remember what doctor said after coming out from the OT Big Baby, and my wife is a strong woman. I should tell you one thing our baby birth happened during the first wave of covid. She has been like a family member when we are in hospital. Once you go to her, trust her fully. You may find her very strict. *** *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** True Doctor.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Thankful and forever grateful to Dr. Poornima Ramakrishna who made me feel so confident and at ease throughout pregnancy and for being so supportive throughout labour and delivery. One knows, pregnancy, delivery and post partum can go either way. But I strongly believe when in good hands of a doctor who is so thorough and patient and helps with a smooth labour, one can only be left with a profound and meaningful birthing experience. Have been recommending Dr.Poornima to all my friends and family circle because of having had such a great experience after consulting her. No unnecessary scans, she is thorough and precise with her diagnosis and instructions. I delivered my baby in Feb 2021 in the hands of Dr.Poornima Ramakrishna and her able team at Apollo Cradle. Was induced to go into labour as I had dilated few cms but wasn't getting natural contractions, post which delivered vaginally without any tear and gentle suturing. She even called my husband into labour room for support and a very dramatic cheer and push required during delivery. My husband and I still cherish when we think of those moments.
