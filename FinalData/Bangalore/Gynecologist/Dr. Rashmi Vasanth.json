My daughter was delivered in the hands Dr Rashmi only. She treated my wife with atmost care and responsibility. I still remember she arrived at the hospital in the wee hours and stayed until my kidoo was delivered safe and healthy. I recommend Dr Rashmi Vasanth for all your needs related to OB-GYN. Dr Rashmi Vasanth is simply down to earth and humble doctor who has vast knowledge of what she does and whom she treats. Half of your problems are solved by way she speaks to you itself. God bless her with health and wealth. ",

I was reffered to her with one of our family known doctor and truly it was my best experience in Bangalore. She did an detailed analysis of my wife and explain each and every small things to my wife during the scan. Also it was so nice of her to again put the same efforts to explain everything to me again showing our baby on screen.. The way she was explaining few things I was getting emotional sometime thinking someone from my family is sitting at doctor seat. Thanks man for giving us such nice experience and answering all our questions. Being an outsider from UP, I felt overwhelmed by your gesture and support. Now we feel that we are at right place & in right hands.. Also the other staff members at the kshema diagnostic centre is very polite and supportive. Truly recommend place to visit for pregnancy scans.. THANKS..!!",

Since i was late for the scheduled appointment i asked the staff for expected waiting time and told them if it is taking long, then i would not want to disrupt other patient and i would be willing to reschedule or cancel the appointment.The staff with very loud voice started shouting at me saying it was your fault you came late. I told her i agree it is my mistake and please reschedule or cancel.When i asked to cancel they took me in for a scan and this doctor who was very busy till then started lecturing me on how i was impatient and how i am causing inconvenience to others. I have clearly told her i don't have intention to cause inconvenience to other patient, but at 7th month i have travelled a distance of 25kms in 2 hrs and my stitch from previous c section is stretching and hurting and i cant sit for long and hence i asked for rescheduling/cancellation without causing trouble to anybody. She said the scan takes more than hour.She was no agreeing to my side of story which was ok with me till then. What happened after that was shocking. I have paid 3800 for this scan. Initially she asked for previous scan report and said without that report she will not be able to scan me.Then when i found the report she started complaining about the other doctors work by saying the report is too short and all. I told her my gynae has already seen the report and she is fine with the report. The scan which was supposed to be taking 1 hour she finished in 10 mins.In that 10 minutes first five minutes she spent on cribbing about how i don't respect or appreciate what they do and because of me she has to fight with other staff and all.I felt the urge to cancel the appointment and walkout of the scan room.Still i held back. Then the next 5 mins she and the ultrasound room staff who argued with me earlier started cross talking between themselves right in between the scan about how the staff feels like quitting and how they are having bad time because of me.Doctor was supporting and encouraging the staff to go on with her verbal assault on me. Together the doctor and staff created such a hostile environment inside the scan room and caused me emotional harassment/mental torture. I would have been OK if they had cancelled the appointment but accepting the patient and torturing the patient is so unprofessional. There are other doctors who whatever their feeling are wont take it out on patients and certainly not in between the scheduled consultation/appointment. Rashmi dint had the patience to finish the scan and then talk.She was taking out her frustration right in between the scanning session.Generally during these scans husband is asked to join inside the scan room but this doctor and staff Sonia was so busy with their verbal abuse that they dint even called my husband inside leaving me alone inside scan room to take this verbal assault from the doctor and her staff. The only reason i went to this doctor was my gynae referred her.",
