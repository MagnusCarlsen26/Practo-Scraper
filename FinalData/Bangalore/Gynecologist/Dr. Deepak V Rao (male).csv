"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"If there is a gynecologist who is different from others … who is focused more on CARE than optimal time spent of patients, who is more focused on right treatment than insist on choice of how /where his patients get the tests done, who is more focused on relation with patient than opportunity to make money, such a doctor should be known to every want to be mothers.. Hence I write this review.
My case: 
I had a miscarriage, though been continuously consulting an able doctor in a commercial, successful exclusive maternity hospital. 

I took enough gap to allow my body to fully recover, then started consulting “top rated” gynecologist for other competing maternity hospitals to find reasons for my miscarriage and how I can start over again **** ***** *********** I was to discover that the hospitals & doctors are focus on optimal churn out of patients / cross selling services from linked   diagnostic centers and promoting high margin drugs. There was no CARE for my condition nor was there right guidance.

At this junction, one good friend asked me to Meet MR Deepak Rao from Rashmi Hospital

Rashmi Hospital is in Indiranagar, Double Road Bangalore. Walk in to this hospital I saw a sea difference from other hospitals, It’s a modern highly equipped hospitals minus the “commercial” MBA business approach. The recipe any patient with complicated pregnancy case would look for.
Dr Deepak Rao, studied all my reports [again a difference from other hospitals who would suggest to get all tests done again in their own linked diagnostic centers] 

This time when I got pregnant again, Dr ensured that all my medical parameters are carefully checked, soon not only I discovered why I had a miscarriage in the first round but this time around Dr Deepak Rao was carefully weighing options for my medication. He was in touch with us on phone/ email/ sms and I always felt secured. 
At this junction, all was not well to my husband too. He had to go through an operation. Though my husband was not a patient to Dr Deepak Rao. My doctor would always ask him about his health and would be concerned to our health. [Optimal time taken for patient consultation was not his priority – CARE was]
Even at the last weeks when I had developed a condition that resulted into C section Dr Deepak Rao ensured my baby and I are safe.
Today my bundle of joy is 10 months, I visit Rashmi Hospital to meet the pediatrician there, but if our doctor Deepak Rao pass by, He ensures he talks to us in person and genuinely shows care.
In short if you are looking for a gynecologist who establishes connect, showers care, gives time, treats your condition optimally and you are in Bangalore – Only Dr Deepak Rao & Rashmi Hospital.
