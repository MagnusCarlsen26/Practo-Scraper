None,None,0,0,YES,"I consulted with Dr Sheela for my second child and really, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care she provided throughout my pregnancy and during the delivery of my baby. Her professionalism, expertise, and compassionate approach truly made all the difference. From our very first appointment, I felt reassured and supported by her approach and guidance. She took the time to listen to my concerns and always answered my questions with patience and understanding. Her calm demeanour and reassuring presence helped alleviate any anxieties I had along the way.

During the delivery, complications arose but her encouragement and support gave me the strength I needed during those pivotal moments. I will always be grateful for her steady hand and unwavering dedication.

Even after the delivery, her care didn't stop. She continued to provide invaluable support during the postpartum period, offering guidance on newborn care and addressing any concerns that arose.

Thanks to her, I had a positive and empowering birth experience that I will cherish forever. I wholeheartedly recommend her services to anyone seeking exceptional care during pregnancy and childbirth.

Thank you, Dr Sheela, once again for everything.

None,None,0,0,YES,"I am so happy to have trusted Dr. Sheela with my Mirena removal. My Mirena insertion had been very painful and had to be done under anestesia. I feared that it was going to be a repeat of the same this time around too. But to my surprise, the procedure went off very well; with no sedatives, with the shortest time possible and completely painfree. Dr. Sheela is very friendly, approachable and understands the pulse of her patients. She is a good listener and puts one at ease with her efficient appraisal of the situation. I would highly recommend her after having experienced her healing touch myself.",2024-05-02 06:15:52,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
