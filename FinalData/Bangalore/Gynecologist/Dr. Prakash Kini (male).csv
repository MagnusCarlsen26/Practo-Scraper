"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,",0,0,YES,"I am fortunate to be one of Dr. Prakash Kinis patients. He is the fourth doctor we saw on our journey to becoming parents.. and we decided there is no fifth!  Despite the unusual circumstances of going through(I had 3 miscarriages before my Son happened) , he made me feel at ease for the entire length of my pregnancy and delivery.
He initially took a thorough look at my heavy, thick medical record(with all that miscarriage history and numerous tests done to us) that I had brought with me from the other hospitals. Primarily, Dr. Kini took his time and spoke to us in depth. I was at peace because I noticed he was trying to take one step at a time and taking everything into a different perspective than what I was told before.   I immediately started feeling very comfortable and confident after a long time of being distressed about possible negative outcomes of my conversations with any other doctors.  I was not scared this time at all..Thanks to his insight and care, I cannot imagine a more supportive, brilliant OBG and Cloudnine is lucky to have him at the helm. 
All he told us was, forget about the past and soon you are going to be parents!! All he feeds into your head is positivity. He never treated mine as a special case, no extra scans, no extra medicines, no extra tests. he is soo confident that his touch(experience) tells him everything and doesnot require a scan so often .
His bedside manner made me feel no longer a patient, he answers all the questions himself without even asking for it.. In each visit he mentions stay positive and enjoy your pregnancy at least a 10 times..
I had PIH started from 31nd week ,  again his mantra is only to stay calm and take rest.. because of increasing BP In 35th week I had to get an emergency Csec for which we weren’t prepared!! And guess what, his magical hands jus gave us what we were praying for- A Healthy Baby!!!
Without a second thought I recommend Dr Kini to anyone who is looking for a hassle free Pregnancy till Delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"On this doctor's day, i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr Prakash Kini. We do not have enough words to tell the way he has handled our case.
He diagnoses the problem perfectly and tells clearly on what must be done. He doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines or scans, but he insists us to stay happy, calm and positive.
The very line which always resonates and has helped me the most even now is ""Stop worrying and Start living"". I can never forget this line. Every visit with him was bringing us so much positivity and i thoroughly enjoyed both my pregnancies and gave birth to two lovely kids. His methods are too good specially post C section, I was able to walk on my own the very same day feeding my little one with a happy face, I could return to walking, swimming etc in just a few days after my C section. The best part is the way he involves the husband in the entire process from the start, I feel that is extremely important which brings a big support and with all these there will be no question of postpartum depression. We are too lucky and fortunate to have him as a doctor and again we just can't thank him enough.

I had a troubling experience with this doctor. Despite my continuous bleeding for over a month, he refused to prescribe medication.
