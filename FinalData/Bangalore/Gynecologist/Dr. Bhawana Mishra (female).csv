"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Fertility Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Great Experience!! I met Dr. Bhawana Mishra upon one of our friend’s suggestion and I’m very pleased with my choice to have her as my Gynecologist.
She is one of the most professional Doctors I’ve ever met. What differentiates her from others is her emotional capabilities. 
After two miscarriages and difficulty in conceiving we had lost all the hopes. She gave us a ray of hope and guided me with invaluable suggestions which helped me to conceive and have a smooth delivery. It would have not been possible without her guidance. My pregnancy was a complicated one, but she was there for me all the times like a mother, very caring and compassionate. She always took time to listen to my health needs and answered all my questions (even silly doubts). Few qualities of her which I really want to appreciate and accentuate are:
•	Professionalism- Exceptionally good in her field *** ********* ***** ********* ** ********* ****** ** ***********•	Empathy – Which is rare to see these days. A great listener and genuinely concerned about her patient’s well-being. You can share all your doubts and fear without any hesitation.
•	Availability – She makes sure that you can get in touch with her when needed (you can text her when facing any issue and will surely get reply from her). 
•	She always tries to avoid unnecessary medicines.

Icing on the cake was clinic staffs, very polite and helpful. I can say this was the best experience I have had in a clinic.
