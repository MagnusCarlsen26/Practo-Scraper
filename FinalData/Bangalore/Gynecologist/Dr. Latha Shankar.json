My wife wanted a girl, that would be 3rd C section. So we were looking for a doctor who can support us in all ways. Did had bad experiences while l looking for a good doctor in bangalore. Finally we met Dr Latha Shankar. She was very supportive and she made us to boost our confidence level. Her treatment was just beautiful. She is quite positive and has lots of patience which is very much needed, not to panic the patient. She is very detailed oriented and give good amount of time to listen to the patient. Difficult to find such doctor in Bangalore. She look at all aspects of the patient and then suggest the medicines. This gives women not only the medical support but emotional support as well. And as all is well we have our angel in life born, doing good. Thank you Doctor and let god help you to help many more people.",

Met a doctor for the first time who is not after money but is more concerned about the patient. Doesn\u2019t prescribe any unnecessary medication or tests unless it\u2019s required. Very confident about the medical treatment she gives and so far it has been a good experience with Dr. Latha. Would recommend her to all those women who are looking for genuine gynaecologist. ",
