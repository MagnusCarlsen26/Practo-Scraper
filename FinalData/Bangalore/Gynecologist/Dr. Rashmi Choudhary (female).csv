We feel lucky to meet Dr. Rashmi, she is an extremely super supportive doctor.
I would recommend Dr. Rashmi to everyone who is looking for a Doctor with a combination of Professionalism, Compassion, Knowledge, Confidence and Strong Work Ethics.
We are blessed with a baby boy. The prenatal and post delivery care was handled by Dr Rashmi at Cloudnine in Bellandur.  I had a normal delivery and she waits for things to take it's course of time normally instead of hurriedly deciding for c section or induced labor or suggesting epidural. She gave good encouragement during delivery to push the baby. she treated me as her own daughter in the labor ward,  Post delivery care was also very good.
Like any other elated new to-be parents we had tons of questions and concerns. Dr Rashmi helped us overcome all our fears and handled us extremely sensitively.
I am extremely satisfied and happy with that I consulted Dr., Rashmi for my first pregnancy. She is an expert and carries a rich experience in her field.
Dr. Rashmi has answered all our queries with lot of patience and was always reachable on phone and watsapp at anytime. She is very gentle in her procedures and has an expert hand. Dr. Rashmi was easily able to make out the problems just by looking at the symptoms.

She was warning us not to ask silly questions and said not to discuss insignificant things. As a medical doctor, she may find certain things to be silly but as a patient it is normal for my friend to ask her doubts on the treatment options. Because of doctor's unprofessional behavior, we got nervous and uncomfortable. She may have 100 issues outside her clinic, she is not supposed to show that on her patients. It is unethical and unfair to do that. Had she been a little polite in answering our doubts, my friend would have felt a lot better and confident.  We couldn't ask any more questions due to her unprofessional attitude, we had to walk out of her cabin. We had paid 4000/- for the consultation and diagnostics.

After 7month I conceived naturally. She suggested only required medicines and scan, nothing unnecessary.

I never felt that I am going to meet a doctor. She always treated me like her own daughter and I also have a motherly feeling with her. She always responded over call/what's app.
At the time of labor pain, she came early morning for delivery and motivated me to push baby as I was all over exhausted due to pain. And finally blessed with a healthy baby girl through normal delivery.

She was able to quickly identify issues with cervical length and contractions even before external symptoms were visible. 

During the fifth month of our pregnancy, it was only due to the doctor's intuition that we performed a cervical scan and identified that the cervical length was extremely low and a stitch was needed.

Again at around 32 weeks, it was again the doctor's intuition that found us doing another scan where we found that her canal was starting to open and bed rest was needed.

In both cases, my wife had experienced no physical discomfort nor any external symptoms that rang any alarms. 

The doctor was able to identify all these issues with her experience beforehand and was able to perform remedial actions. Thanks to her my wife gave birth at 37 weeks without any issues.
