Later we understood he is cautious, practical and scientific in his approach with treatment ie he wants to gather all the facts before suggesting a course of action.\n\nAt every step of the way, he explained to us the odds of success very candidly, which my husband and I appreciated. \n\n** *** *** ********* *** *********** ***** ** ************ His understanding of issues plaguing fertility is deep and reasoned. I never felt the need for a second or third opinion around him.\n\nThere was a time when we were nervous about embryo transfer, and he brought our faith up with his kind words \u201cDon\u2019t worry ma, itll be alright\u201d :) ..\n\nThanks to his intervention, we conceived in 4-5 months end-to-end with our first try at IVf. \n\nThe nurses and staff at his clinic are super well- trained at handling scans, injections, retrievals and transfers.  \n\nA good doctor handling your case can impact your life\u2019s outcomes, and Dr. Basavaraj sure did change ours for the better.\n\nWe are immensely thankful to him. We would recommend people facing the same issues to visit him without any hesitation.\n\nMinor areas of improvement: 1) His clinic does have a big wait time, so pls be prepared for that and keep time with you handy when you go in. \n\nSince it is a life changing treatment, I did not view this negatively, but for some it can be frustrating. \n\n2) sometimes I felt our conversations can be more two-way than one way. For e.g. on precautions on exercise, I had a diff POV but not much time to express it\u2026",

Dr Initially gave us the details of the treatment which are their, He explained IVF with ICSI process and cost involved in a very detailed manner and cleared all our queries. We started taking injections from Day 2 until Day 10 and he monitored the follicle growth periodically. He did all the scans and egg retrieval procedure himself. Successfully egg retrieval was done and fertilization happened and we got 6 embryos developed to blastocyst stage. As my hormone level is high, doctor suggested doing the embryo transfer after a month to avoid any complications.  While all these were in Process. He never gave us the false promises he usually answers to the point, he always checked on the conditions how I was responding and tried to build the confidence in us. This Confidence which he gave us brought the Belief within in us that sure we would have the success in the next cycle of the transfer. \nAnd now I am 10 wks pregnant which was a dream and Hope always when I had attend the other Fertility clinics where they cheated us with false treatment and false promises. Unlike other clinics This place does not talk about hope. This Place really boost you with the Belief. They rightly have the tag line BELIEVING IS EVERYTHING!!  as only when you Believe You can do it and He will help you to achieve your Dream. This Doctor is the one who will first make your self believe that you can do and he gets this done!!  I have seen there is Never NO\u2026 or IMPOSSIBLE word in his Clinic and It is always YES we can do it!!\nHe is having a very good team of nurses; He always gives you positive energy. We are lucky to get treated by him. I would definitely suggest people suffering with Infertility to consult him and be patience with the treatment process and protocols and you will succeed for sure.\n\nOur Sincere thanks for Dr. Basavaraj *** *** *** ****** *** *** ****  Thank you for all the guidance and support till date. Wish You and your Family Always Be Happy!!  \n",

Doctor  Basavaraj patient listener and builds your confidence. He has vast knowledge in the field and gives a detailed description of the issue. Doctor  BD went through all the investigation reports done earlier and shared the explanation for the ailment found in detail and guided us though towards the success. \n\nWe met him when we lost all our hopes of having someone special in our life.. After having 3 failed IVF cycles ( elsewhere-with other esteemed, busy and money making doctors- do not wanted to criticize \u2013 but it\u2019s truth  ) and going though immense mental and emotional pain we gave up.  We thought maybe it\u2019s god\u2019s wish and our destiny for not having someone special who we love and cherish for rest of our life. We never thought that we will have precious little miracles in life. We never thought that heaven has smiled down on us and though you. \n\nWe can only see the god in our prayers but you know we met one.. yes and \u201cin you\u201d \u201cin Dr. Basavraj Devarashetty\u201d . Sir there are no words through which we can ever express our feelings, there are no words though which we even can thank you. You are genius and we cannot forget you for rest of our life. You made it possible for us..\n\nHonestly, what a wonderful thing to have a doctor who actually cares about your feelings, and takes the time to explain his thinking. You are a great doctor, and when we think back to the days when we met you first we realize that we have taken one of the best and decision of our life. Our entire experience from our first visit to the moment we walked out the door with our two little angels was beyond positive. \n\t\n \u201cWe are truly grateful of you and with this testimonial we wanted to announce that Our home has expanded by four feets! God has sent Two miracles from above, a daughter and a son for all to love.\n\nAnd all this just because of you.....\n",

One of my office colleague advised us to consult him once. Under his guidance & treatment now we are blessed with a baby boy after conceiving naturally. He listens to the problems very patiently & accordingly prescribes treatment. ** **** *** ********* *********** ********* * *** ****** He does not encourage unnecessary usage of money of patients & supported us to try naturally as there was no profound reasons found for the miscarriages.My wife got pregnant after 6 months of consultation. In the 1st trimester, complications started & we again started losing hope but He handled the problem very efficiently & with utmost care. By his treatment, we ultimately crossed 1st trimester. The support staff in his clinic are very friendly & each & everyone in his clinic always have a smiling face. He is a living GOD to us. We often say that Doctors are next to GOD & he is a true example of this. His magical treatment gave us a new life. W/O Him we would not have seen this day. Truly we see GOD through Him. We don't have words to say thanks to Him. We pray to GOD that he gets more strength, courage & blessings from the Almighty so that He can bring more & more happiness in the life of childless couples. I urge to all the childless couples throughout India to come to Bangalore & take his guidance & treatment & by this we can see more & more success stories in the future.",

I already had another appointment so I wanted my consultation should be done as per my slot.Instead of understanding our time, he started behaving very rudely and without getting any proper solution we left the clinic.\nOne thing I got to know is he might helped someone who was really in a condition where he was not getting any help from others so he might helped them but that doesn\u2019t means that who is expecting some solution in early stages is wrong.",

We visited him for infertility treatment and found that he was extremely supportive and positive in his outlook. \nHe is very cool *** **** **** ************* ** *** ******* He always shows us a warm positive picture of our problems. He reiterates that all these problems can be solved and there is no reason we should feel tensed. This itself gives us lot of relief. Our discussions with him removed complete stress from us. We visited him for almost 5 months now and every time he pays us the same attention and care. \nHe will not pressurize us for any treatment and maintains a high level of integrity and dignity while dealing with patients. \nHe will not prescribe any unnecessary tests/medicine/scans and cares about his patients and our spending always. \nWe went to him after reading lots of reviews on practo and other sites. Now, I have referred almost 4 couples like us to him. \nOnce again, have complete faith and belief in him and Be positive!!\nAll the best to everyone who reads this review.\n",

I had 2 failed IUIs previously with 2 different doctors but with him we got lucky in 1st IUI & in now in my 2nd trimester. He never pushed us for necessary tests or expensive treatments. Within 2 months under his medication we got lucky.\nAgree there is too much of waiting time but I have seen the doc still seeing each and every patient and giving good amount of time.\nMy personal exp: Once there was too much of rush so support staff asked me to come next day but I asked them to show my file as he asked me come on particular day (when ovulating even hours counts). After seeing my file he told he will scan me on the same day, and he was there in the clinic till 10:30 PM. I was the last patient too be consulted but I really appreciate his dedication that he waited so late and consulted each & every one including me to see/scan me and prescribe medicine accordingly.\nWill definitely recommend Dr Basavaraj for fertility treatment.",

We are taking treatment for it from last 3 months. Dr started our treatment with ovulation induction approach where they give medication for follicular growth and then HCG injection once egg mature to release it.\nWe are under this treatment from last 3 months, but unfortunately no success yet but I will still say that Dr do his job very property and professionally. He will answer to all the questions calmly and explain problem and treatment plan in detail.\nAlthough we didn't succeed yet but based on my knowledge from internet reading I feel Dr is taking care of our treatment nicely and doing whatever possible, hope God will bless us someday. Going through a little stress and frustration, due to continuous failures, taking help of yoga to overcome it.\nStaff at clinic is also very supportive and good. I will recommend Dr Basvaraj, as he is very professional and great at his job, he will never give you false hope, he will just explain you everything technically.",

Later we understood he is cautious, practical and scientific in his approach with treatment ie he wants to gather all the facts before suggesting a course of action.\n\nAt every step of the way, he explained to us the odds of success very candidly, which my husband and I appreciated. \n\n** *** *** ********* *** *********** ***** ** ************ His understanding of issues plaguing fertility is deep and reasoned. I never felt the need for a second or third opinion around him.\n\nThere was a time when we were nervous about embryo transfer, and he brought our faith up with his kind words \u201cDon\u2019t worry ma, itll be alright\u201d :) ..\n\nThanks to his intervention, we conceived in 4-5 months end-to-end with our first try at IVf. \n\nThe nurses and staff at his clinic are super well- trained at handling scans, injections, retrievals and transfers.  \n\nA good doctor handling your case can impact your life\u2019s outcomes, and Dr. Basavaraj sure did change ours for the better.\n\nWe are immensely thankful to him. We would recommend people facing the same issues to visit him without any hesitation.\n\nMinor areas of improvement: 1) His clinic does have a big wait time, so pls be prepared for that and keep time with you handy when you go in. \n\nSince it is a life changing treatment, I did not view this negatively, but for some it can be frustrating. \n\n2) sometimes I felt our conversations can be more two-way than one way. For e.g. on precautions on exercise, I had a diff POV but not much time to express it\u2026",

Dr Initially gave us the details of the treatment which are their, He explained IVF with ICSI process and cost involved in a very detailed manner and cleared all our queries. We started taking injections from Day 2 until Day 10 and he monitored the follicle growth periodically. He did all the scans and egg retrieval procedure himself. Successfully egg retrieval was done and fertilization happened and we got 6 embryos developed to blastocyst stage. As my hormone level is high, doctor suggested doing the embryo transfer after a month to avoid any complications.  While all these were in Process. He never gave us the false promises he usually answers to the point, he always checked on the conditions how I was responding and tried to build the confidence in us. This Confidence which he gave us brought the Belief within in us that sure we would have the success in the next cycle of the transfer. \nAnd now I am 10 wks pregnant which was a dream and Hope always when I had attend the other Fertility clinics where they cheated us with false treatment and false promises. Unlike other clinics This place does not talk about hope. This Place really boost you with the Belief. They rightly have the tag line BELIEVING IS EVERYTHING!!  as only when you Believe You can do it and He will help you to achieve your Dream. This Doctor is the one who will first make your self believe that you can do and he gets this done!!  I have seen there is Never NO\u2026 or IMPOSSIBLE word in his Clinic and It is always YES we can do it!!\nHe is having a very good team of nurses; He always gives you positive energy. We are lucky to get treated by him. I would definitely suggest people suffering with Infertility to consult him and be patience with the treatment process and protocols and you will succeed for sure.\n\nOur Sincere thanks for Dr. Basavaraj *** *** *** ****** *** *** ****  Thank you for all the guidance and support till date. Wish You and your Family Always Be Happy!!  \n",

Dr. Basavaraj Devarashetty is that genius who made us believe in that.

Doctor  Basavaraj patient listener and builds your confidence. He has vast knowledge in the field and gives a detailed description of the issue. Doctor  BD went through all the investigation reports done earlier and shared the explanation for the ailment found in detail and guided us though towards the success. \n\nWe met him when we lost all our hopes of having someone special in our life.. After having 3 failed IVF cycles ( elsewhere-with other esteemed, busy and money making doctors- do not wanted to criticize \u2013 but it\u2019s truth  ) and going though immense mental and emotional pain we gave up.  We thought maybe it\u2019s god\u2019s wish and our destiny for not having someone special who we love and cherish for rest of our life. We never thought that we will have precious little miracles in life. We never thought that heaven has smiled down on us and though you. \n\nWe can only see the god in our prayers but you know we met one.. yes and \u201cin you\u201d \u201cin Dr. Basavraj Devarashetty\u201d . Sir there are no words through which we can ever express our feelings, there are no words though which we even can thank you. You are genius and we cannot forget you for rest of our life. You made it possible for us..\n\nHonestly, what a wonderful thing to have a doctor who actually cares about your feelings, and takes the time to explain his thinking. You are a great doctor, and when we think back to the days when we met you first we realize that we have taken one of the best and decision of our life. Our entire experience from our first visit to the moment we walked out the door with our two little angels was beyond positive. \n\t\n \u201cWe are truly grateful of you and with this testimonial we wanted to announce that Our home has expanded by four feets! God has sent Two miracles from above, a daughter and a son for all to love.\n\nAnd all this just because of you.....\n",

One of my office colleague advised us to consult him once. Under his guidance & treatment now we are blessed with a baby boy after conceiving naturally. He listens to the problems very patiently & accordingly prescribes treatment. ** **** *** ********* *********** ********* * *** ****** He does not encourage unnecessary usage of money of patients & supported us to try naturally as there was no profound reasons found for the miscarriages.My wife got pregnant after 6 months of consultation. In the 1st trimester, complications started & we again started losing hope but He handled the problem very efficiently & with utmost care. By his treatment, we ultimately crossed 1st trimester. The support staff in his clinic are very friendly & each & everyone in his clinic always have a smiling face. He is a living GOD to us. We often say that Doctors are next to GOD & he is a true example of this. His magical treatment gave us a new life. W/O Him we would not have seen this day. Truly we see GOD through Him. We don't have words to say thanks to Him. We pray to GOD that he gets more strength, courage & blessings from the Almighty so that He can bring more & more happiness in the life of childless couples. I urge to all the childless couples throughout India to come to Bangalore & take his guidance & treatment & by this we can see more & more success stories in the future.",

I already had another appointment so I wanted my consultation should be done as per my slot.Instead of understanding our time, he started behaving very rudely and without getting any proper solution we left the clinic.\nOne thing I got to know is he might helped someone who was really in a condition where he was not getting any help from others so he might helped them but that doesn\u2019t means that who is expecting some solution in early stages is wrong.",

He reiterates that all these problems can be solved and there is no reason we should feel tensed. This itself gives us lot of relief. Our discussions with him removed complete stress from us. We visited him for almost 5 months now and every time he pays us the same attention and care. \nHe will not pressurize us for any treatment and maintains a high level of integrity and dignity while dealing with patients. \nHe will not prescribe any unnecessary tests/medicine/scans and cares about his patients and our spending always. \nWe went to him after reading lots of reviews on practo and other sites. Now, I have referred almost 4 couples like us to him. \nOnce again, have complete faith and belief in him and Be positive!!\nAll the best to everyone who reads this review.\n",

I had 2 failed IUIs previously with 2 different doctors but with him we got lucky in 1st IUI & in now in my 2nd trimester. He never pushed us for necessary tests or expensive treatments. Within 2 months under his medication we got lucky.\nAgree there is too much of waiting time but I have seen the doc still seeing each and every patient and giving good amount of time.\nMy personal exp: Once there was too much of rush so support staff asked me to come next day but I asked them to show my file as he asked me come on particular day (when ovulating even hours counts). After seeing my file he told he will scan me on the same day, and he was there in the clinic till 10:30 PM. I was the last patient too be consulted but I really appreciate his dedication that he waited so late and consulted each & every one including me to see/scan me and prescribe medicine accordingly.\nWill definitely recommend Dr Basavaraj for fertility treatment.",

We are taking treatment for it from last 3 months. Dr started our treatment with ovulation induction approach where they give medication for follicular growth and then HCG injection once egg mature to release it.\nWe are under this treatment from last 3 months, but unfortunately no success yet but I will still say that Dr do his job very property and professionally. He will answer to all the questions calmly and explain problem and treatment plan in detail.\nAlthough we didn't succeed yet but based on my knowledge from internet reading I feel Dr is taking care of our treatment nicely and doing whatever possible, hope God will bless us someday. Going through a little stress and frustration, due to continuous failures, taking help of yoga to overcome it.\nStaff at clinic is also very supportive and good. I will recommend Dr Basvaraj, as he is very professional and great at his job, he will never give you false hope, he will just explain you everything technically.",

He is always available for any doubts and whenever we go for consultation he made us very comfortable. I have met him in the year of 2013 for the first time when I was unable to conceive naturally. He saw all the reports which I have done earlier and asked me to do some scanning. After that he explained the real problem that I am having and gave the suggestion. He suggested me to go for ET-IVF,but I was not ready for it. That time I didn't know that only one option i.e IVF is left for me. Then I have tried Ayurvedic treatment and visited Motherhood hospital too but it doesn't workout. In Motherhood hospital one of the doctor told me that my uterus is not visible and even IVF also not possible in my case. I was shocked. That time I took the best decision in my life i. e to go back to CloudNine and meet Dr. Basavaraj  Devarashetty. Again he welcomed me with a smile and recognized me. He checked my all the reports and asked now  R you ready for IVF. I said yes. He explained all the procedures and the cost of IVF. With the God's grace and the experience of the doctor, in the first cycle  itself I got positive result. This could happen only because of the best treatment given by the doctor. Now I am blessed with a baby boy.                          Dr. Basavaraj Devarashetty is really a GOD to our family. With his best treatment we have become parents. Doctor there are no words to explain our feelings and to thank u. You are really a great doctor and we cannot forget you for rest of our life. Thank u thank u so much doctor.                                                  I would definitely recommend him for the people who are having fertility problem. Please contact him and get the positive result.                                \n\n",

Basavaraj after reading lots of positive reviews on internet and also one of my friends gave good feedback about him. I never met any other doctor for fertility treatment before. During my first visit itself I felt very comfortable to talk to him openly and enquired about all possible options available. The best thing I liked about him throughout this journey was his temperament and a positive attitude. He has a very cool temperament that he easily maintains inspite of his hectic work pressure. He never suggested unnecessary tests and medications. After few tests, he suggested ICSI. I still remember his reassuring words after I almost gave up. He said this process needs only one good sperm and not many. So he said that you don't need to worry when someone has less or poor sperm count . Those reassuring words turned to be very powerful and true towards the end for me. When the actual procedure was done, only one embryo survived out of 18 and that's because only one sperm turned out to be of good quality. His words turned out to be golden words for me and I became thankful to this great doctor forever as I have a cute son on my lap today. He turned 1 year. He has already started walking and speaking \ud83d\ude0a My life has become much more beautiful after the arrival of my son and I have a new meaning for this life. No money could compensate for the changes he brought in my life. Thank you very much doctor. Long live Dr. Basavaraj and long live your service.\n\nPeople generally talk about waiting time, but I would say that his treatments are life changing events and waiting time for this doctor is just worth it.

He is very calm, composed and gives a patient hearing.  He reiterates that all these problems can be solved and there is no reason we should feel tensed. He followed a step by step procedure and within 2months, my problem got solved. Am into the second trimester now.  \n\nLast but not the least nurses in the clinic were very polite, courteous, and compassionate.\n\nWe are very thankful to Dr. Basavaraj and his team. I strongly recommend him to those who wish to start fertility treatment. ",

In a matter of few cycles he nailed my problem and I conceived. He gives only that treatment which is necessary and doesn't call for unnecessary tests. Now I'm 7 months pregnant and going strong. We completely attribute our success story to his approach of treatment.",

Our repetative doubts and requests for explaning different ART procedures multiple times never seem to irritate him and he explained it very well everytime. He had been very empathetic and encouraged us to have patience and persevere our efforts to complete the treatment when we almost lost hope. Soon, by the grace or God and Dr. Basavaraj's successful treatment, I conceived and we were blessed with our bundle of joy!! We are indebted to Dr. Basavaraj for his patience and the enthusiasm with which he handled our case and helped us experience the joy of parenthood!! Thank you Dr. Basavaraj!! ",

A doctor may be good but if he doesn't connect with patient he might not do justice with what he is worthy of. I have never seen doctor Basavaraj not willing to answer questions I endlessly asked him. ** ***** ****** ** *** *********** ***** * ********* ** ********** ***** ** * **** ** ********* ** **** ***** **** ******** ********* He never forced any decision on us and gave us time to think and discuss things. Even though he is busy but he never failed to respond to the queries or concerns on mails and messages. I think we are blessed to have such a doctor in Bangalore who is super good in what he is doing and down to earth at the same time. He is definitely a recommendation for couples seeking help. We were blessed with favourable results and are highly obliged to him. I will also like to thank Sister Susan for being so patient and helpful. It is definitely nice to see cheerful faces at a doctors place. Regards",

Will not ask for unnecessary test. After 8 years of our marriage with multiple miscarriages now pregnancy is confirmed and progressing well. Considering my past history of multiple miscarriage  Dr paid extra attention and ensures we are on right track. He is an important person in our life and added value to our life. Merely wasted four years consulting other fertility doctors. If I had met Dr. Basavaraj before would have been mom of five year old kid. I would strongly recommend him for any couple who's struggling to conceive. Unlike my previous doctors he doesn't take leave often and he is always reachable via mail or SMS even when his is out of station this enables us to continue our course of treatment without any break .  As doctor is qualified to take scans,  patients need not shuttle between scan centre and consultation which saves lot of time for patients.  I was able to manage my office work and consultation. Very  responsible person and his dedication towards his work is remarkable",

It turned out to be a fairly long journey - replete with attempts and setbacks. However not for once did he give up on us and leave us feeling helpless and alone. He motivated us to keep going and today because of him, we are on our way to realize our cherished dream this year.       \n\nWe are yet to come across a doctor who is so gentle and composed and yet so effective and transformational. He is a great listener and gives ample time and attention to you every single time you meet him - something that any couple in distress would really long for but unfortunately is becoming a rarity with established doctor's these days. His work ethic is bound to impress you - he doesn't overload you with medicines or advises. He keeps it simple and takes time to explain every bit of details you. He suggests but doesn't impose. He is always there for you and returns every message of yours.   \n\nWe have got high regards for Dr Basavaraj and would recommend him to any couple looking to overcome infertility related issues. ",

During the treatment I got pregnant for the first time in my life but unfortunately I misscarried in the initial phase itself. After that I had another miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Finally after one year of trying I was able to conceive without any issues and delivered a healthy baby boy few months back. During our treatment, we have full faith and trust on him. We believed that if I would ever get pregnant after so many issues, it would be with his treatment only. He is very calm, polite and sensitive person. He always gives time and courage to each patient to overcome any difficulty. We would like to recommend him for people who are struggling to conceive for long time. He is God to us. May God bless him for healthy, happy and long life. ",

Nurses and other lab staff are good.  Initially the wait time was less .  while the wait time is on higher side since doctor does scan and procedures in parallel. The wait time doesn't change even with prior appointment . This is especially true in Marathahalli centre. This can be improved. I feel cost here for treatment is much lesser than any corporate hospitals or other centres. Doctor is mostly straight forward and not verbose which some might not like. Also doctor prescribes just enough medication which might or might not be good, hard to judge.",

And during this time I must have met close to 6-7 doctors. And most of them have  had a very cold attitude towards the trauma I was going through. \n\n I had a very complicated case, doctor was extremely understanding and told me in every step of treatment how good or bad my chances are; and I would have to be really patient with my treatments. There were times, when he suggested we cancel our cycles and take a break when I was not responding well to medicines (instead of spending money and taking my body trough all the trauma)- most doctors in Bangalore wont even flicker an eyelid. \n\nHe is very well behaved and meets are treats all his patients personally. Because of doctors like him the faith in humanity and doctors is still alive. ",

He let's the couple make the decisions and never imposed on a particular treatment. I had 4 IUI procedures, the first was an unfortunate miscarriage , the doctor clearly explained the reasons and gave good support during the difficult time. The 4th IUI resulted in a successful pregnancy and we are now proud parents of a healthy baby girl. We are very grateful to Dr. Basavaraj for being such a wonderful person and a supportive doctor. We strongly recommend him for anyone looking for a considerate doctor for their fertility treatments. ",

Unlike other doctors who are eager to get to IVF, he made sure we exhausted other alternatives. Throughout the treatment cycle and subsequent examinations the quality of treatment was superb without unnecessary extra medication and experimentation (like we have heard about other doctors) . Above all he kept us in a positive frame of mind with his gentle demeanour and fact based discussions. \n\nWe would highly recommend Dr. Basavaraj for infertility treatments",

We started our IVF treatment  and I must say I was extremely impressed by the professionalism and close monitoring that the doctors put us through.\n\nI am pleased to say that  our IVF was successful the first time itself and we are now going to become a proud parents.\n\nI would advise all couples trying to get pregnant to give Dr Basavaraj a visit.\n",

Unfortunately my IUIs were unsuccessful and I also had an ectopic pregnancy. However, throughout this difficult period I did not lose hope.

Being a very friendly person, Dr. Basavaraj Devarashetty started the treatment with precisely keeping the above in  mind. Given that we went through a complicated pregnancy (Ectopic) earlier, it made us feel very relaxed and comfortable. Before we started consulting the doctor, we had almost made up our mind on going for IVF. But, he always insisted that IVF is the last resort and there is a very good chance of conceiving naturally. He made us believe and made us hope for the best.  \n\nWe sincerely thank you Sir for the wonderful experience.\n\nThank you.\nRaj",

We had a 6.30pm appointment for which we were specifically called and asked to come earlier at 6pm which we did. And then we were made to wait till 8.45pm to meet the doctor! The staff has no clue and no track of which patients to be sent in sequence, no sanctity of an appointment schedule and no respect for people\u2019s time. \nHowever when we met the doctor he assured us this typically does not happen, hoping for a better experience in the future.",

We were very happy and felt positive since our first visit. He explains our problem in detail and takes time to explain the treatment as well. He is very friendly and doesn't rush us during our visit. He even alters his schedule to treat us should there be a need. He even answers our queries on WhatsApp as well. I thank Dr. Basavaraj for the transparent *** ********* treatment. We were able to conceive within 3 months of visiting him. Today we are blessed with a beautiful baby boy. ",

At last, we  visited Dr. Basvaraj at cloudnine old airport road for infertility issues. Doctor explained us IVF - ICSI treatment very well and he suggested us ICSI. He gave us new hope with lots of positive energy. He always gave right advice and allow us to decide on treatment. He neither scare nor gave false hope about result. He did not prescribe unnecessary reports. We went through 2 TVOA  because my AMH is low. Then  ICSI cycle based on doctor's advice.  Finally I conceived in 2 cycle of ET. These all process took 10 months. I happy to say I am 5 month pregnant. I recommend you to consult Dr Basvaraj. Please have faith and patience and you will get result.",

He answers the queries patiently even if you repeatedly ask him the same question. Meeting him gives me that lost hope. He answers queries through WhatsApp and sms. Till date it has never happened that he didn't respond to my query in WhatsApp or SMS. Two  disadvantages with him .One is as he's seeing many patients he tends to forget the treatment he's giving us . I make it a point to convey to him that earlier I have gone through this particular test/treatment. Second is waiting time to meet him. Every time though it's a bit frustrating to wait for 90mins minimum ,I tell myself to have patience and meet him. ",
