     Yes I had known Dr. Sangeeta for a very long time, almost 7 years. I still remember the day I first met her (she is my go to Doctor since then for all my Health Problems), I was having high fever and hospitalized at St. Johnes for almost two days when I went  home after two-days fever didn‚Äôt go away, one of my neighbors suggested there is a good Gynecologist why don‚Äôt I see her once, I told her I was not married, why would I see Gyne for this fever, she told me you just meet her once as she is also a general physician. In the evening I went to her HSR Clinic and met Dr. Sangeeta, she examined me and took some history and suggested a few medicines and told me, my fever should come down within 24hrs and next 48hrs you should be ok and I was ok. Fever didn‚Äôt come back at all after that.

  4 months later I got married and I got pregnant after 6 months of my marriage. When I got pregnant, I knew I Doctor already and I didn‚Äôt have to look for another Doctor as by this I had gotten very good feedback about Doctor Sangeeta including my experience. During my entire pregnancy I was so relaxed. Doctor made me so comfortable and I didn‚Äôt have to worry abt anything I had low placenta and she guided me through entire my pregnancy, each time I went for checkup she made me feel so good with her beautiful smile on her face. She sent me to St. Philomena for delivery I wondered why when cloud 9 is close to me but later I realized it was a best decision Dr. Sangeeta took as I was being taken care so well, including arranging a expert Doctor for guiding me how to breastfeed when I was struggling to feed. 

    Doctor Sangeeta not only be with us during entire Delivery period or a surgery but she also guide us through our recovery. You just have to call the clinic number and leave message and she will guide us over a message. She may call back only if it is necessary else she will respond to your message , I understand she is busy and most beautiful thing about her she will respond to message

None,"Infertility,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I have visited many Gynaecologists in Bangalore for about 5 years without any success. After 5 years of various treatment and one failed IUI we have almost lot hope of divine blessing. Then one of our fried suggested about Dr.  Sangeetha Gomes of ‚ÄúCare Clinic‚Äù in HSR Layout Bangalore. By this time we have decided to go for IVF after lots of research.
 In the first visit to care clinic (Dr. Santgeetha Gomes) we decided to go ahead with IVF treatment and doctor also rightly suggested not to waste too much time on different treatment and medicines. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes is very humble and cleared all out doubts without getting irritated by the silly questions. And explained all pros and cons of the treatment, cost associated with the treatment etc. 
For egg collection and transfer process we are advised to meet Dr. Manjunath from NOVA. It was great to meet another humble and caring doctor. Both the doctors (Dr. Sangeetha Gomes and Dr. Manjunath) took care of all the process and treatment very well. Facilities and support staff at NOVA also was very good. Finally egg collection day came and we were happy that 18 eggs were collected, but after 2 weeks we came to know that out of 18 only 2 were grown as embryo. By the gods grace and proper care / treatments by the doctors, out of the 2 embryos one was successful. We were luckiest as only 2 embryos were there and it was successful as there was no chance for 2nd transfer. 
Pregnancy care after this are ‚ÄúCare Clinic‚Äù was at its best. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes has advised us on each steps to be taken care of. We generally used to barge in to clinic to ask some silly doubts due to the tension of precious pregnancy, but Dr. Sangeetha Gomes cleared all our doubts properly without any hesitation. 9 months journey was very smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. Support staff of the care clinic also were really good. 
We have selected motherhood hospital Sarjapur Road for the big day. It was grand welcome for the little one and all in the family were on cloud nine. Dr. Sangeetha has arrived on time for the delivery, regularly visited us and advised duty doctor / support staff very well.  
Experience at ‚ÄúMotherhood Hospital‚Äù was very enriching throughout the delivery process and stay till discharge. Services in all departments of hospital was very good including admin and billing / insurance. Nursing staff has taken care of baby very well, even in the midnight also we can see the smiling face. 
Thanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes / Dr. Manjunath and Motherhood team. I strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes if you are planning for pregnancy or for treatment for infertility.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Family Planning,",0,0,YES,"A year ago we had relocated to Sarjapur area and were in search of good gynaecologist and hospital to get help. Since Motherhood hospital was very close to our house we started researching about the hospital and found it quite good (based on reviews). For selecting the doctor, we took some time. We read all the reviews and after a lot of deliberation we decide to visit Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. And I MUST say that was the best decision we made. Since it is very easy to get misguided in this sensitive issue of ‚Äòplanning for a family‚Äô, it becomes necessary to get a right kind of doctor and Dr. Gomes is a wonderful doctor. We visited Dr. Gomes in the month of July ‚Äô19 for pre-pregnancy check-ups wherein she asked us to undergo a list of tests (which was fair too). When she found out that my fertility rate was very low, she right away suggested some treatments after giving proper counselling. We must say that the doctor has very very positive vibes with very practical attitude. She makes everything sounds doable. However, in our case she turned out to be our ‚Äòlucky charm‚Äô. Because after visiting her the next month itself I got conceived all naturally. So, for us she is a lucky mascot. Since then she is our DOCTOR. During the entire pregnancy she gave us right kind of advice and if there was something concerning instead of panicking, she would immediately suggest next steps. We love our consultation sessions which used to be not more than 5 minutes but gave us so much relief (and good laughter sometimes). We always felt she is a very cool doctor who can lighten the whole situation with her style of consulting. I delivered my baby girl during lock-down (April‚Äô20) through caesareans delivery (we had decided to go for surgery instead of normal delivery to avoid any risk during this outbreak. Doctor had properly explained to us that C-section is not a bad option and there is no risk too.). We must say that those 9 months went by very smooth and we thank her for every bit. She never suggests any unnecessary tests or medicines. I used to go with list of questions, and she would answer them all. We really recommend DR Sangeeta Gomes and we suggest to at least meet her once. 

About the hospital, we have only good things to talk about just like DR Gomes. Very polite staff and very well managed facility. We have never experienced any chaos or never had any trouble throughout. The nursing staff at the hospital is fantastic and have been very patient with us post-delivery. They extended their support in everything and we really like to thank them specifically (nursing staff at second floor). We certainly recommended Motherhood Sarjapur hospital to everyone.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Fertility Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We were blessed with a baby Girl on 22/04/2019, we have started consulted Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in 2017 after one of our family friend (From our Apartment) has recommended to check with her as they also got benefited with her consultancy and blessed with the Baby Boy, 
Prior to consulting with DR. Sangeetha, we have consulted more than 3 other doctors in recognized hospitals of Bangalore. We have wasted 3+ years of time, energy and money with these Gynecologist, where every time we just get confirmation of next appointments dates and medicals bills. Among Three Dr.s One Dr. has referred to another Dr. after 1.5 years of consultancy, we never gone there again. And because of one dr.‚Äôs tremens my wife‚Äôs lungs filled with water. We almost most lost trust on any Dr.
Then our journey started with Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in July 2017 and in the 1st visit itself we realized that we can trust this Dr. and we were not wrong about this realization and my wife conceived within 4 months of her treatments, completely natural pregnancy, unfortunately it didn‚Äôt go well and no heartbeats heard from 1st pregnancy.
Next Good News came after 1 year in Aug 2018 and we are very happy with complete duration of treatment and delivery went well and blessed with little angle.
These 2 years have been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. She is very patient and humble, and listens to you calmly unlike the other doctors who are on a rush to consult the waiting patients. We meet her at her clinic as well as Motherhood hospital from the very beginning of our pre-pregnancy and pregnancy. She gave very detailed advice at every stage, her staff was also very supportive and responsive all the time. And she always recommends natural remedies whenever required. She treats you as well-known person I was always surprise to see that she recalls all the medical history without seeing the files despites of many patients.
This was our 2nd Pregnancy, we were guided by Dr. Sangeetha Gomes at each phase. She handled our case very sensitively. We faced some issues like cough, cold and fevers and also an accidental Water burns in 8th month and we were very scared but, she did everything that can be done by her by regular checkup, Scans, Hb Tests, TSH Test, Blood Sugar Test and other necessary Tests like NST was done regularly to monitor heart rate of Baby - all reports were normal. 
We opted Mother Hood Hospital. Dr. has given dates in 38th week where my wife has admitted in the hospital and same day delivery happened in the morning. My wife delivered our baby Girl on 22nd April 2019 and got discharged on 24th April 2019. She used to help her with all our worries/queries and being transparent in diagnosing her which helped us to build trust on her. She had also helped us in post-Pregnancy with proper advice and Medications. I gained almost 12 kgs. And was able to complete my term in 38 weeks and my daughter was born healthy and she is doing well. 
I would highly recommend her for anyone who is planning pregnancy or for all kind of gynecology related consultancy..",2019-06-04 14:52:31,False,True,Rashmi Kushwaha,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We are originally from West Bengal and moved to Bangalore for work. Around a year into our marriage, my wife encountered health issues‚Äîvaginal infections and irregular periods‚Äîleading us to seek medical assistance. Initially, we consulted a doctor who, despite treating her, lacked warmth and delivered distressing news: suggesting that a normal pregnancy might be challenging and advocating for IVF due to an underlying issue.

Devastatingly, after conceiving naturally back in our hometown, we faced a miscarriage at two months into the pregnancy. This loss left us deeply disheartened. However, upon returning to Bangalore and seeking a second opinion, we were fortunate to learn about Sangeeta Mam through a colleague at my workplace.

Sangeeta Mam's approach was a game-changer. Her empathetic demeanor and reassurance filled us with hope. Instead of discouragement, she offered encouragement, sharing her own experiences and stories of other couples who had overcome similar challenges. Under her guidance and care, my wife underwent a tailored treatment plan.

What struck us most was Mam's ability to transform the atmosphere in her office. Couples, initially weighed down by sadness, left her room with smiles, having found comfort, positivity, and renewed hope.

After six months of dedicated care under Mam's guidance, we returned to West Bengal. And thanks to Mam's expertise, my wife successfully delivered our first child‚Äîa beautiful baby boy. Sangeeta Mam's consultations were not just medical but also deeply personal and uplifting. Her unwavering support made our journey to parenthood a fulfilling and joyful one.

For anyone facing similar challenges, we wholeheartedly recommend Sangeeta Mam's expert care. You'll not only receive exceptional medical guidance but also find solace and optimism in her compassionate approach.",2023-11-22 05:03:48,False,True,Kabir Ahmed,,,

From the very first visit to her clinic, my wife felt confident in her abilities, and our experience throughout the pregnancy and childbirth journey was nothing short of exceptional.

She possesses an extraordinary blend of expertise, compassion, and a reassuring demeanor that instantly put us at ease. She took the time to thoroughly explain every aspect of the pregnancy, addressing our concerns and ensuring that we were well-informed and comfortable with every decision. Her approachable nature and willingness to answer even the smallest of questions made us feel valued and cared for throughout the entire process.

During labor and delivery, Dr.Sangeeta Gomes showcased her unwavering dedication to her patients. Her calm and composed demeanor instilled a sense of confidence in us, assuring us that we were in capable hands. Her skillful guidance and expertise were evident as she navigated through the challenges of childbirth with grace and precision. She maintained open communication with my wife, ensuring that her comfort and well-being were always the top priority.

What truly sets Dr. Sangeeta Gomes apart is her genuine empathy and compassion. She understands the emotional rollercoaster that pregnancy and childbirth can be and provides not only medical support but also emotional support. Her warm and caring approach created a supportive environment that made the entire experience more manageable for my wife and me.

Today, as we hold our precious baby boy in our arms, we are profoundly grateful to Dr. Sangeeta Gomes for her extraordinary care and expertise. Her commitment to excellence in the field of gynecology and obstetrics is evident in every aspect of her practice. We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sangeeta Gomes to anyone seeking top-notch healthcare and support during their pregnancy and childbirth journey.",2023-09-25 09:10:26,False,True,Nishant Bhargava,,,

I was 7 weeks pregnant and was initially seeing another doctor. Somehow I felt, I was being mislead by my previous doctor. Cutting the long story short, finally I came across an undesirable miscarriage. while announcing the miscarriage upon an ultrasound at the doctor's clinic, the previous doctor tagged my pregnancy as a scar ectopic pregnancy which was earlier never established in my previous scans. I was also told that there was abundant vascularity in and around my uterus for which is why I should go for a Intrasac Methotrate process for abortion. Somehow I was not convinced with this advise and felt this could be life-threatening. 

Immediately  I decided to go for a second opinion. I went to doctor  Sangeet Gomes( found on Google with great reviews) the same evening with all my medical papers. There was a huge queue. However, looking at my condition, she agreed to see me at the earliest. She was super diligent in looking at my history and with her level of knowledge , genuinity and expertise, she could immediately instill confidence in me as a doctor. I got really good vibes from that very moment and requested her to take up my case entirely and treat myself accordingly. She was gracious enough to guide me the best possible way with proper and systematic investigation and medical steps in place. Finally at a very reasonable cost she took me through a Suction and Evacuation process at Manipal Hospital where she ensured I get the right and absolute care. She herself visited me and called up multiple times to check on my status while I was admitted. She did the procedure with amazing backup plans and preparations in place to ensure my physical safety. I am truly humbled by her gesture as a doctor. Even now after two months of my abortion, I still get calls from Care clinic to check on my health and wellbeing.

Doctor made me so comfortable and I didn‚Äôt have to worry abt anything I had low placenta and she guided me through entire my pregnancy, each time I went for checkup she made me feel so good with her beautiful smile on her face. She sent me to St. Philomena for delivery I wondered why when cloud 9 is close to me but later I realized it was a best decision Dr. Sangeeta took as I was being taken care so well, including arranging a expert Doctor for guiding me how to breastfeed when I was struggling to feed. 

    Doctor Sangeeta not only be with us during entire Delivery period or a surgery but she also guide us through our recovery. You just have to call the clinic number and leave message and she will guide us over a message. She may call back only if it is necessary else she will respond to your message , I understand she is busy and most beautiful thing about her she will respond to message

None,"Infertility,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I have visited many Gynaecologists in Bangalore for about 5 years without any success. After 5 years of various treatment and one failed IUI we have almost lot hope of divine blessing. Then one of our fried suggested about Dr.  Sangeetha Gomes of ‚ÄúCare Clinic‚Äù in HSR Layout Bangalore. By this time we have decided to go for IVF after lots of research.
 In the first visit to care clinic (Dr. Santgeetha Gomes) we decided to go ahead with IVF treatment and doctor also rightly suggested not to waste too much time on different treatment and medicines. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes is very humble and cleared all out doubts without getting irritated by the silly questions. And explained all pros and cons of the treatment, cost associated with the treatment etc. 
For egg collection and transfer process we are advised to meet Dr. Manjunath from NOVA. It was great to meet another humble and caring doctor. Both the doctors (Dr. Sangeetha Gomes and Dr. Manjunath) took care of all the process and treatment very well. Facilities and support staff at NOVA also was very good. Finally egg collection day came and we were happy that 18 eggs were collected, but after 2 weeks we came to know that out of 18 only 2 were grown as embryo. By the gods grace and proper care / treatments by the doctors, out of the 2 embryos one was successful. We were luckiest as only 2 embryos were there and it was successful as there was no chance for 2nd transfer. 
Pregnancy care after this are ‚ÄúCare Clinic‚Äù was at its best. Dr. Sangeetha Gomes has advised us on each steps to be taken care of. We generally used to barge in to clinic to ask some silly doubts due to the tension of precious pregnancy, but Dr. Sangeetha Gomes cleared all our doubts properly without any hesitation. 9 months journey was very smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. Support staff of the care clinic also were really good. 
We have selected motherhood hospital Sarjapur Road for the big day. It was grand welcome for the little one and all in the family were on cloud nine. Dr. Sangeetha has arrived on time for the delivery, regularly visited us and advised duty doctor / support staff very well.  
Experience at ‚ÄúMotherhood Hospital‚Äù was very enriching throughout the delivery process and stay till discharge. Services in all departments of hospital was very good including admin and billing / insurance. Nursing staff has taken care of baby very well, even in the midnight also we can see the smiling face. 
Thanks to Dr. Sangeetha Gomes / Dr. Manjunath and Motherhood team. I strongly recommend Dr. Sangeetha Gomes if you are planning for pregnancy or for treatment for infertility.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Family Planning,",0,0,YES,"A year ago we had relocated to Sarjapur area and were in search of good gynaecologist and hospital to get help. Since Motherhood hospital was very close to our house we started researching about the hospital and found it quite good (based on reviews). For selecting the doctor, we took some time. We read all the reviews and after a lot of deliberation we decide to visit Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. And I MUST say that was the best decision we made. Since it is very easy to get misguided in this sensitive issue of ‚Äòplanning for a family‚Äô, it becomes necessary to get a right kind of doctor and Dr. Gomes is a wonderful doctor. We visited Dr. Gomes in the month of July ‚Äô19 for pre-pregnancy check-ups wherein she asked us to undergo a list of tests (which was fair too). When she found out that my fertility rate was very low, she right away suggested some treatments after giving proper counselling. We must say that the doctor has very very positive vibes with very practical attitude. She makes everything sounds doable. However, in our case she turned out to be our ‚Äòlucky charm‚Äô. Because after visiting her the next month itself I got conceived all naturally. So, for us she is a lucky mascot. Since then she is our DOCTOR. During the entire pregnancy she gave us right kind of advice and if there was something concerning instead of panicking, she would immediately suggest next steps. We love our consultation sessions which used to be not more than 5 minutes but gave us so much relief (and good laughter sometimes). We always felt she is a very cool doctor who can lighten the whole situation with her style of consulting. I delivered my baby girl during lock-down (April‚Äô20) through caesareans delivery (we had decided to go for surgery instead of normal delivery to avoid any risk during this outbreak. Doctor had properly explained to us that C-section is not a bad option and there is no risk too.). We must say that those 9 months went by very smooth and we thank her for every bit. She never suggests any unnecessary tests or medicines. I used to go with list of questions, and she would answer them all. We really recommend DR Sangeeta Gomes and we suggest to at least meet her once. 

About the hospital, we have only good things to talk about just like DR Gomes. Very polite staff and very well managed facility. We have never experienced any chaos or never had any trouble throughout. The nursing staff at the hospital is fantastic and have been very patient with us post-delivery. They extended their support in everything and we really like to thank them specifically (nursing staff at second floor). We certainly recommended Motherhood Sarjapur hospital to everyone.

Prior to consulting with DR. Sangeetha, we have consulted more than 3 other doctors in recognized hospitals of Bangalore. We have wasted 3+ years of time, energy and money with these Gynecologist, where every time we just get confirmation of next appointments dates and medicals bills. Among Three Dr.s One Dr. has referred to another Dr. after 1.5 years of consultancy, we never gone there again. And because of one dr.‚Äôs tremens my wife‚Äôs lungs filled with water. We almost most lost trust on any Dr.
Then our journey started with Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in July 2017 and in the 1st visit itself we realized that we can trust this Dr. and we were not wrong about this realization and my wife conceived within 4 months of her treatments, completely natural pregnancy, unfortunately it didn‚Äôt go well and no heartbeats heard from 1st pregnancy.
Next Good News came after 1 year in Aug 2018 and we are very happy with complete duration of treatment and delivery went well and blessed with little angle.
These 2 years have been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes. She is very patient and humble, and listens to you calmly unlike the other doctors who are on a rush to consult the waiting patients. We meet her at her clinic as well as Motherhood hospital from the very beginning of our pre-pregnancy and pregnancy. She gave very detailed advice at every stage, her staff was also very supportive and responsive all the time. And she always recommends natural remedies whenever required. She treats you as well-known person I was always surprise to see that she recalls all the medical history without seeing the files despites of many patients.
This was our 2nd Pregnancy, we were guided by Dr. Sangeetha Gomes at each phase. She handled our case very sensitively. We faced some issues like cough, cold and fevers and also an accidental Water burns in 8th month and we were very scared but, she did everything that can be done by her by regular checkup, Scans, Hb Tests, TSH Test, Blood Sugar Test and other necessary Tests like NST was done regularly to monitor heart rate of Baby - all reports were normal.

Around a year into our marriage, my wife encountered health issues‚Äîvaginal infections and irregular periods‚Äîleading us to seek medical assistance. Initially, we consulted a doctor who, despite treating her, lacked warmth and delivered distressing news: suggesting that a normal pregnancy might be challenging and advocating for IVF due to an underlying issue.

Devastatingly, after conceiving naturally back in our hometown, we faced a miscarriage at two months into the pregnancy. This loss left us deeply disheartened. However, upon returning to Bangalore and seeking a second opinion, we were fortunate to learn about Sangeeta Mam through a colleague at my workplace.

Sangeeta Mam's approach was a game-changer. Her empathetic demeanor and reassurance filled us with hope. Instead of discouragement, she offered encouragement, sharing her own experiences and stories of other couples who had overcome similar challenges. Under her guidance and care, my wife underwent a tailored treatment plan.

What struck us most was Mam's ability to transform the atmosphere in her office. Couples, initially weighed down by sadness, left her room with smiles, having found comfort, positivity, and renewed hope.

After six months of dedicated care under Mam's guidance, we returned to West Bengal. And thanks to Mam's expertise, my wife successfully delivered our first child‚Äîa beautiful baby boy. Sangeeta Mam's consultations were not just medical but also deeply personal and uplifting. Her unwavering support made our journey to parenthood a fulfilling and joyful one.

For anyone facing similar challenges, we wholeheartedly recommend Sangeeta Mam's expert care. You'll not only receive exceptional medical guidance but also find solace and optimism in her compassionate approach.",2023-11-22 05:03:48,False,True,Kabir Ahmed,,,

She possesses an extraordinary blend of expertise, compassion, and a reassuring demeanor that instantly put us at ease. She took the time to thoroughly explain every aspect of the pregnancy, addressing our concerns and ensuring that we were well-informed and comfortable with every decision.

Somehow I was not convinced with this advise and felt this could be life-threatening.

However, looking at my condition, she agreed to see me at the earliest. She was super diligent in looking at my history and with her level of knowledge , genuinity and expertise, she could immediately instill confidence in me as a doctor. I got really good vibes from that very moment and requested her to take up my case entirely and treat myself accordingly. She was gracious enough to guide me the best possible way with proper and systematic investigation and medical steps in place. Finally at a very reasonable cost she took me through a Suction and Evacuation process at Manipal Hospital where she ensured I get the right and absolute care. She herself visited me and called up multiple times to check on my status while I was admitted. She did the procedure with amazing backup plans and preparations in place to ensure my physical safety.

Areas on which I was not satisfied are minor. Firstly, she is not directly accessible. Her phone number will be handled by her clinic nurses. You may not be able to talk to her even during emergency.
Secondly, I was not completely satisfied with any of the hospitals that she visits. She is a consultant and hence there is a disconnect post the delivery. Post-delivery care is left to junior, unexperienced doctors and nurses who are guided over phone by Dr. Sangeeta. So in case of any complication, you are at mercy of these incapable doctors.

Since we were consulting at her clinic, she gave us all the hospital options where we could get the delivery done, pushed us to visit the hospitals to find out which one we were comfortable with.

Such dedication and commitment is a very rare quality! Dr.Sangeetha was like a family member in the labour room and she tried her best for me to have a normal delivery, which in the end I did.

I had lost hope of becoming a mother, having met almost all top shot gynecologists in bangalore without any positive outcome. When we got to know about her, looking a gynecologist in hsr, I had expected my consultation  to be the same as other famous gynecologists in bangalore- doctors meet you for five minutes and send you off for numerous tests.  She has what others lack-personal touch. But we were pleasantly surprised by the way she approached our problem.  She is everything you would want in your doctor and more than that she is a wonder person. It  was such a relief to finally get a wonderful doctor who instantly took charge of my problem and took care of me like a special person.  She took time to analyze my case and charted our a treatment plan designed specifically for me. She is highly efficient and methodical in her approach. She is friendly and patiently answered all trivial queries that we had, something that we found lacking in others. She is also very very positive and extremely confident which also puts the patient in a positive frame of mind, much needed when you are battling infertility. Her able guidance helped me survive my difficult pregnancy with almost all listed complications - diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, carrying twin-with ease and to a near full term without any mishaps, which would have been otherwise impossible. Meeting her was so soothing that I would actually look forward to our monthly consultations during my pregnancy. I could reach her anytime via sms or phone call in case of emergency. She is well connected to good doctors also and this helped us in managing  the other problems that I had.  Thanks to her, we are now proud parents a boy/girl twins and this happened within a year and half of first meeting her.  She is an excellent surgeon and I was up and about within 12 hours of undergoing an emergency c section and healed completely within a week. The nurses at her clinic are also competent and well trained . I wish her all success and I pray to God that may she continue to enrich the lives of many more desperate couples wanting to become parents. I strongly recommend Dr Sangeeta to anyone looking for a good gynecologist particularly for infertility. You will be in good hands.  ",2015-09-20 03:04:53,False,True,Swati Das,,,

We couple acknowledge Heartly thankful to Dr SANGEETHA GOMES madam & entire CARE CLINIC staff
We would strongly recommend Dr SANGEETHA GOMES for any obstetrics and gynecology related issues (from Infertility to HIGH RISK PREGENANCY (especially)), reasons are as mentioned below: 
we consulted Dr.sangeetha gomes in 30th week of pregnancy after NT scan, where my wife had Major medical complication""(COMPLETE) CENTRAL PLACENTA PERVIA"", 
Fetal medicine Dr. told us, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúabnormal symptom with High risk pregnancy‚Äù, normal delivery is 99% not possible and suggested to consult well experienced gynecologist who has good record in handling High risk pregnancies & well equipped hospital with good pediatrician‚Äôs doctors as well.
Before we met Dr.sangeetha Gomes, my wife consulted Dr.XYZ of ABC Hospital in BTM Layout, After NT scan report Dr.XYZ was not confident in handling my wife pregnancy due to complete placenta pervia (High Risk pregnancy)
After this issue, we started for searching various & top 5 maternity hospitals in Bangalore for good doctor, who can handle the high risk pregnancies, finally I got Dr.Sangeetha Gomes reference by a friend parents
Dr.sangeetha Gomes is simple, confident & down to earth kind of person with 22 years of experience, In the first visit itself, Dr., took 20 mins to diagnose medical reports, answered our issues & boosted with positive approach & guided my wife , 
By 30th week my wife hemoglobin count has reached below 9.2% for which she given food supplements & iron infusion, it miracle by 36th week hemoglobin count increased to 14.2%, mean while she has given ‚Äúbaby Lungs development‚Äù dose,  since C-section was planned on 38th week due complete placenta pervia 
Dr Sangeetha Gomes asked us to meet every week & closely monitored my wife health, since our baby‚Äôs heart beat was fluctuating in 37th week plus, finally by 37th week 4 days she asked us admit to Fortis hospital on 26th may 2017 morning 7 a.m and Fortis team arranged everything required for safe delivery of my wife, by 2:11 p.m (C-section) , It was very ‚ÄúGOOD NEWS from madam we had blessed with  healthy BABY BOY, mother is also SAFE & recovered quickly‚Äù
Even after delivery with her busy schedule, Dr.Sangeetha Gomes personally called to my wife enquired about pain & baby health, visited forties after 3 days of delivery to check the health condition of mother and baby
Post delivery she guided my wife regarding Breast feeding to baby, lactation techniques & recommended, given my wife medical dose against ‚ÄúCervical cancer‚Äù
Lastly I had goggled lot research regarding various ‚ÄúBaby stem cell banking‚Äù companies to store stem cell, madam explained pros & cons and recommended to ‚ÄúCHORD LIFE‚Äù, which we opted 
Dr.Sangeetha Gomes is not a money minded, she is doing perfect justice to her profession, she ask patents only to take any medical tests if it‚Äôs really required to diagnose any abnormal medical parameter 
It was Happy, healthy & joyful Journey of my wife & baby after we started consulting madam,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Sangeeta in first month of my second pregnancy and followed her throughout the pregnancy till my delivery. I am very satisfied with the way Dr. Sangeeta handled my case. One thing that stood out in all the regular checkups is that she is very experienced and gets the signals quite early For Eg. in our case she asked me to control diet to make sure that baby weight doesn't become too much to create complications in Normal Delivery, and it turned out that baby was fully grown(3 KG) when I normally delivered in my 37th week of pregnancy. 

One more thing I observed about the doctor is that she is very patient and avoids unneccessary steps as much as possible. During the 9th month we observed that Baby's heart rate used to spike above 180, while she brought it to our notice and explained the possible complications she did not jump to any action, only when she observed that my AFI(Water Levels) was contineously dropping after a couple of weeks, she asked me to go for NVD by inducing.

When I got admitted and pains were induced, I took pains for several hours without my cervix opening much, I asked the the doctor that I wont have enough strength to push the baby if pains are increased further, doctor actually stopped the pain induction allowed me to have foods and recover my strength and sleep till next early morning, when she resumed inducing the pain. In this whole process we had lost hopes since during my first time I experienced that inducing could lead to C-sec or use of instruments while birthing. So we were constantly asking doctor if we should go for C-sec directly. But Doctor had full confidence in her experience and me too and hence she encouraged me in every possible way for NVD and mentioned that we will try for NVD till the end. Only because of this I could gather all my strength and deliver baby normally under her guidance. Thanks to my doctor. 

Last but not the least the staff of Dr. Sangeeta (Special thanks to Dr Shweta who helped me deliver without Epidural, Sisters, Nurses- special thanks to Babitha, OnCall Doctors) were as patient and professional as we could expect as a patient. Also would like to mention about Dr Shweta, Atlast stage of my delivery I felt that I would not be able to endure any pains further and asked for Epidural. But Dr Shweta encouraged me for delivering without epidural since I was already in the last phase of delivery and could deliver at any time now. She and the Nurse (I am extremly sorry since I forgot her good name) gave me all kind of comfort level and their words and faith in me helped me in deliverying a healthy baby normally.

It's been a great journey for me from the day my wife got conceived till the time we first saw our little prince with Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. Living away from parents and in laws ...Dr. Sangeeta guidance throughout the journey and the kind of care she took was great. 
on the day when I got to know that my wife  got conceived , we just walked into Dr. Sangeeta Gomes clinic in HSR  layout, which is like my next door in the never changing Bangalore traffic. While we got our turn to meet the doctor, I was going through reviews about Dr. Sangeeta Gomes on practo and Google. That reviews about the doctor gave us a sigh of relief that we were in right place, right hands and lot of our time got saved in searching for a right doctor in a city like Bangalore. She cleared all our doubts with lot of patience and added reasoning for each and every suggestion of hers. She was very particular about the diet a pregnant woman should take and we did follow her strictly and the outcome was a healthy baby of ours. Let me quote with an example on her diet suggestion, looking at my wife‚Äôs weight growth during first few 3months of pregnancy, doctor suggested her to stop having milk and asked her to have only 3 fruits per week. This was a great surprise to our parents and in-laws, started asking us to consult a different doctor as generally all kinds of fruits and milk would be the best diet every person believe once a woman is pregnant. But we followed doctor suggestion in all the diet plan she suggested. Diet plan differs from person to person and that doctor only could tell depending on the patient response.  Our journey was smooth and once during our consultation post 30 weeks, she has predicted the baby weight depending on the latest ultra sound scan and gave us confidence of normal delivery. To our surprise on our 9th month scan it was detected that baby has loop around the neck and doctor has suggested to go for c-sec as might get complicated during vaginal delivery, explaining us different angles of her suggestion and left the final decision to us. According to our decision we waited for normal delivery, but one evening uneasiness in the stomach led us to her clinic and the test that she did that night showed that baby heart beat dropped and we went for emergency C-section section. 
On special note I would like to thank care clinic's sisters for their follow-up from the time my wife got admitted to almost a week post discharge from the hospital.

We were blessed with a baby Girl on 17/02/2017 (Normal Delivery) and we consulted Dr. Sangeetha Gomes in motherhood hospital right since the good news was heard. Our journey through these 9 months has been really smooth under the consultation of Dr. Sangeetha Gomes.
She is very caring, polite and listens to all the issues patiently.
We were never asked to go for any un-necessary tests and  all required test/scan were done on time. She is very flexible and never imposes any restrictions on where the tests or scan should be done. 
She kept encouraging my wife for normal delivery and even being living alone in bangalore (without parents), we never panicked. 

We got admitted in hospital at 4:30 AM and doctor was quick to reach hospital in no time considering my wife was already 7 cm dilated.

We never had any availability issues, we were always able to clear our doubts through her care clinic contact no. She generally responds to patients queries via messages.

The best thing was, even after discharge from hospital, we kept on getting regular calls from care clinic asking about the well being of my wife and baby and in case of any doubts or issues, we got appropriate replies from doctor and same was the case throughout the last 5-6 months of our pregnancy.

We are extremely satisfied with how things turned out and really appreciate all her effort.

We never had to undergo unnecessary scans and tests or bear any extra costs and everything we did was well explained per the rule book. You always feel more assured after every visit since a lot of things she could say by visual observation and touch.
Since the basic nursing facilities (for iron drips/other common  injections in pregnancy) are within the clinic, you dont need to be admitted to a hospital and the whole process is really hassle-free.
The recommended hospital (Motherhood) was one of the better experiences we could have expected(much better than the one in our first child ) and given that other friends had reported bad experiences with other hospitals in Bangalore. We got real professional support during delivery and an extremely cosy and comfortable place for post-recovery.

With no positive signs, we were in a confused state on what the exact issue was. We consulted two other doctors, underwent tests but it did not help and were scared with medical jargons.
On a friend's advice we consulted Dr. Sangeeta. In the first consulting, she listened to our concerns, checked the tests and provided us with a clear direction on how she will be addressing it. We went for few follow up sessions, during which she gave a complete picture of where we stood, the reason for the tests to take, well explained the results and accordingly how the medications will help. She is also accessible via SMS, and responds in few minutes. Most importantly, she exuded hope and positivity, which I believe is very important. In few months, we were blessed with the news of a new member joining us and we are currently consulting her on this journey of pregnancy.

I had put in my comments on our early pregnancy days and today I echo every bit of it.

A real and spontaneous attitude. She gave us a reason to live yesterday. We  had our baby in the most ambiguous and challenging times.

We are not doctors and we go to doctors since they are subject matter experts and we need to trust their advice else, situations and lives can get complicated. We reached Dr. Gomes in the most bizarre circumstance and she as a good doctor explained the situation to us. She gave the choice to go for normal or C section and never pressurized us for C section.We selected C section after enough interviewing with the doctor and we were convinced that for us it was the way forward. 

My wife delivered our life yesterday and she is already walking. A bundle of joy is breathing in rhythm with us and Dr. Sangeetha Gomes made it happen.

In the first consulting, she listened to our concerns, checked the tests and provided us with a clear direction on how she will be addressing it. We went for few follow up sessions, during which she gave a complete picture of where we stood, the reason for the tests to take, well explained the results and accordingly how the medications will help. Most importantly, she exuded hope and positivity, which I believe is very important. In 1 months, we were blessed with the news of a new member joining us and we are currently consulting her on this journey of pregnancy.
