"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"I contacted Sangeetha mam for my pregnancy treatment. This was my first pregnancy and we were sceptical about whom to go to for checkup and further treatment. Fortunately we found Sangeetha mam. She is someone with lots of experience and very practical in her approach. She is very accurate in  understanding the issue. My entire pregnancy journey was smooth without any hiccups. Around 36th week of my pregnancy, I had severe itching and contacted mam immediately. Went through a growth scan and it was figured out that my amniotic fluid is borderline. Mam suggested two injections for lung maturity of baby on the consecutive days and my delivery was scheduled on the third day. I was induced at around 09:30 pm and delivered my baby boy at 04:03 am (That was a super quick delivery IMO. Her diet and exercises helped a lot here). Mam was following up with duty doctor periodically with duty doctor and she even arrived at the hospital in those early hours. After delivery, I moved to my hometown and suffered from mild pains with episiotomy. Mam followed up with me on phone, took a detailed analysis and suggested treatment which again is accurate and I was able to recover within two days. 

I took 6 months of time to write this review as my baby boy weighed only 2.44 kg at the time of birth and I wanted to make sure everything is fine before writing review. Now, he is a happy little one meeting all his milestones and on track with birth weight chart.

So, overall it's a very positive experience with her and she is also mom-approved doctor. Her multi lingual proficiency needs a special mention.",2024-01-18 07:56:04,False,True,Chandana,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Family Planning,",0,0,YES,"A year ago we had relocated to Sarjapur area and were in search of good gynaecologist and hospital to get help. Since Motherhood hospital was very close to our house we started researching about the hospital and found it quite good (based on reviews). For selecting the doctor, we took some time. We read all the reviews and after a lot of deliberation we decide to visit Dr. Sangeeta Gomes. And I MUST say that was the best decision we made. Since it is very easy to get misguided in this sensitive issue of ‘planning for a family’, it becomes necessary to get a right kind of doctor and Dr. Gomes is a wonderful doctor. We visited Dr. Gomes in the month of July ’19 for pre-pregnancy check-ups wherein she asked us to undergo a list of tests (which was fair too). When she found out that my fertility rate was very low, she right away suggested some treatments after giving proper counselling. We must say that the doctor has very very positive vibes with very practical attitude. She makes everything sounds doable. However, in our case she turned out to be our ‘lucky charm’. Because after visiting her the next month itself I got conceived all naturally. So, for us she is a lucky mascot. Since then she is our DOCTOR. During the entire pregnancy she gave us right kind of advice and if there was something concerning instead of panicking, she would immediately suggest next steps. We love our consultation sessions which used to be not more than 5 minutes but gave us so much relief (and good laughter sometimes). We always felt she is a very cool doctor who can lighten the whole situation with her style of consulting. I delivered my baby girl during lock-down (April’20) through caesareans delivery (we had decided to go for surgery instead of normal delivery to avoid any risk during this outbreak. Doctor had properly explained to us that C-section is not a bad option and there is no risk too.). We must say that those 9 months went by very smooth and we thank her for every bit. She never suggests any unnecessary tests or medicines. I used to go with list of questions, and she would answer them all. We really recommend DR Sangeeta Gomes and we suggest to at least meet her once. 

About the hospital, we have only good things to talk about just like DR Gomes. Very polite staff and very well managed facility. We have never experienced any chaos or never had any trouble throughout. The nursing staff at the hospital is fantastic and have been very patient with us post-delivery. They extended their support in everything and we really like to thank them specifically (nursing staff at second floor). We certainly recommended Motherhood Sarjapur hospital to everyone.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We are originally from West Bengal and moved to Bangalore for work. Around a year into our marriage, my wife encountered health issues—vaginal infections and irregular periods—leading us to seek medical assistance. Initially, we consulted a doctor who, despite treating her, lacked warmth and delivered distressing news: suggesting that a normal pregnancy might be challenging and advocating for IVF due to an underlying issue.

Devastatingly, after conceiving naturally back in our hometown, we faced a miscarriage at two months into the pregnancy. This loss left us deeply disheartened. However, upon returning to Bangalore and seeking a second opinion, we were fortunate to learn about Sangeeta Mam through a colleague at my workplace.

Sangeeta Mam's approach was a game-changer. Her empathetic demeanor and reassurance filled us with hope. Instead of discouragement, she offered encouragement, sharing her own experiences and stories of other couples who had overcome similar challenges. Under her guidance and care, my wife underwent a tailored treatment plan.

What struck us most was Mam's ability to transform the atmosphere in her office. Couples, initially weighed down by sadness, left her room with smiles, having found comfort, positivity, and renewed hope.

After six months of dedicated care under Mam's guidance, we returned to West Bengal. And thanks to Mam's expertise, my wife successfully delivered our first child—a beautiful baby boy. Sangeeta Mam's consultations were not just medical but also deeply personal and uplifting. Her unwavering support made our journey to parenthood a fulfilling and joyful one.

For anyone facing similar challenges, we wholeheartedly recommend Sangeeta Mam's expert care. You'll not only receive exceptional medical guidance but also find solace and optimism in her compassionate approach.",2023-11-22 05:03:48,False,True,Kabir Ahmed,,,

From the very first visit to her clinic, my wife felt confident in her abilities, and our experience throughout the pregnancy and childbirth journey was nothing short of exceptional.

She possesses an extraordinary blend of expertise, compassion, and a reassuring demeanor that instantly put us at ease. She took the time to thoroughly explain every aspect of the pregnancy, addressing our concerns and ensuring that we were well-informed and comfortable with every decision. Her approachable nature and willingness to answer even the smallest of questions made us feel valued and cared for throughout the entire process.

During labor and delivery, Dr.Sangeeta Gomes showcased her unwavering dedication to her patients. Her calm and composed demeanor instilled a sense of confidence in us, assuring us that we were in capable hands. Her skillful guidance and expertise were evident as she navigated through the challenges of childbirth with grace and precision. She maintained open communication with my wife, ensuring that her comfort and well-being were always the top priority.

What truly sets Dr. Sangeeta Gomes apart is her genuine empathy and compassion. She understands the emotional rollercoaster that pregnancy and childbirth can be and provides not only medical support but also emotional support. Her warm and caring approach created a supportive environment that made the entire experience more manageable for my wife and me.

Today, as we hold our precious baby boy in our arms, we are profoundly grateful to Dr. Sangeeta Gomes for her extraordinary care and expertise. Her commitment to excellence in the field of gynecology and obstetrics is evident in every aspect of her practice. We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sangeeta Gomes to anyone seeking top-notch healthcare and support during their pregnancy and childbirth journey.",2023-09-25 09:10:26,False,True,Nishant Bhargava,,,

One more thing I observed about the doctor is that she is very patient and avoids unneccessary steps as much as possible. During the 9th month we observed that Baby's heart rate used to spike above 180, while she brought it to our notice and explained the possible complications she did not jump to any action, only when she observed that my AFI(Water Levels) was contineously dropping after a couple of weeks, she asked me to go for NVD by inducing.

When I got admitted and pains were induced, I took pains for several hours without my cervix opening much, I asked the the doctor that I wont have enough strength to push the baby if pains are increased further, doctor actually stopped the pain induction allowed me to have foods and recover my strength and sleep till next early morning, when she resumed inducing the pain. In this whole process we had lost hopes since during my first time I experienced that inducing could lead to C-sec or use of instruments while birthing. So we were constantly asking doctor if we should go for C-sec directly. But Doctor had full confidence in her experience and me too and hence she encouraged me in every possible way for NVD and mentioned that we will try for NVD till the end. Only because of this I could gather all my strength and deliver baby normally under her guidance. Thanks to my doctor. 

Last but not the least the staff of Dr. Sangeeta (Special thanks to Dr Shweta who helped me deliver without Epidural, Sisters, Nurses- special thanks to Babitha, OnCall Doctors) were as patient and professional as we could expect as a patient. Also would like to mention about Dr Shweta, Atlast stage of my delivery I felt that I would not be able to endure any pains further and asked for Epidural. But Dr Shweta encouraged me for delivering without epidural since I was already in the last phase of delivery and could deliver at any time now. She and the Nurse (I am extremly sorry since I forgot her good name) gave me all kind of comfort level and their words and faith in me helped me in deliverying a healthy baby normally. 

Dr Sangeeta Gomes is the best Doctor. Thank you for all your support. ",2020-04-05 07:46:15,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
