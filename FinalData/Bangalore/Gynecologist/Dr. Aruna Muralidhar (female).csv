Dr. Aruna is a highly qualified, evidence-driven and an experienced doctor. She would always welcome us with a smile in every visit which is very comforting to start with. Post observation, she mentions her current assessment and then explains to us the reason behind a certain test or a scan or a treatment that she may recommend on the need basis. She guided me very well at each stage of pregnancy and was very caring throughout the journey.



Further, very importantly, she gives enough space for us to clarify any of our queries. Even if we, sometimes, ask more doubts or queries, she would address each of them without any iota of showing frustration, hurriedness, or impatience - this is becoming a rare quality for the doctors, especially among the gynaecologists/obstetricians these days and we really appreciate the doctor for that. Post consultation, we always felt that we are well-informed, and that clarity has given us a lot of confidence and comfort. We really appreciate the doctor for this. For us, this was one of the key factors of choosing a gynaecologist apart from the doctor‚Äôs expertise. 



During our regular visits, she got a slight doubt on an aspect during my 33rd week of pregnancy and she proactively took steps in suggesting us to get a scan done, the findings of which corroborated her doubt with a small issue. So, she closely monitored me regularly and guided us accordingly until delivery. I delivered a healthy baby boy via normal delivery mode (using forceps instrument). The delivery process had become slightly complicated due to baby‚Äôs facing/position and that is when we are glad to have the situation dealt by an expert and experienced doctor who was ably supported by her team of junior doctor and nurses. Labor pains are very painful and stressful for anyone and an extended labor duration in my case was even more painful and stressful - but I got excellent support and motivation from the doctor and her team - they were very caring. Immediately after the delivery as well, I was stressed and very tired (partly also due to slightly more blood loss during the delivery) - Doctor addressed this situation deftly.



In conclusion, we are glad that, in Dr. Aruna, we found best of both worlds - an expert who is very caring - which enabled us to feel confident, comfortable and that we are in safe hands. We are grateful to the doctor and would like to express our gratitude towards her for taking care of each stage of my pregnancy and a complicated delivery process so well. We are very happy for welcoming a baby boy to our family!

I had been seeing other doctors for my PCOS from a few months before going to Dr Aruna who gave me treatment for PCOS. Dr Aruna is the very friendly and explains everything during the treatment. Our reason for seeing her was a long term approach about having kids. My treatment started with the PCOS and a little later we started planning for kids. Having PCOS I had been given little hopes before by my friends and family. I am really thankful to ma'am and to my luck that we reached her. Ma'am treatment approach was a long term one and it paid off. I am now a mother to a healthy boy and that too by normal delivery, all thanks to Dr Aruna. The treatment was a step by step plan with ma'am explaining each and every step along the way. It was a long time to reach the end goal but whenever someone says that its a short treatment with results very soon should not fully believe them. Aruna ma'am took all the necessary treatment and a systematic approach with atleast 2 or 3 cycles where we  tried with normal approach to get conceived. I was finally able to conceive with ovulation induction. I liked the most that there was no unneccessary treatment or tests that were conducted or even any unrequired approach for the ovulation. During the initial days ma'am was able to pick up the fact that my sugars were a notch above normal and was accurately about to diagnose gestational diabetes at around the 35th week, which the doctor expected in the first trimester looking at the slight change in the sugars. I call that experience. I followed up with ma'am throughout the pregnancy but there was a complication with the shorting of the cervix which led to me having to undergo cervical cerclage. I underwent the emergency surgery in the able hands of Dr Aruna, who took the utmost care and urgency to do the surgery which was successful. I feel, my husband and I have shared our most exciting wait with the ups and downs during this journey with the strongest support of Dr Aruna.

The professional here in question, Dr. Aruna Muralidhar is  someone I adore as a doctor from day one, she‚Äôs quite professional, rather focused on her work and diagnosis, uses her heart too (one feels cared for rather than being just another patient medical file no); is a gorgeous human being!

I still have a long way to go, but in my heart I have faith that it‚Äôll all going to be okay with my health and our little one in her hands. She gives me hope and reassurance. 
Her communication is clear and brilliant and she bothers to let you ask queries at length which is a rare quality and a must have for all doctors in today‚Äôs day and age where most are dismissive or authoritative. Simply put when a patient understands the situation better, he/she copes better because of the feeling of retained selfcontrol. She bothers to explain along with speaking about options and solutions. She doesn‚Äôt bully you in to ‚Äòbearing‚Äô some routine gynac probing procedure but instead talks you through your discomfort. She also lets you choose what you would want for yourself where treatment options are concerned. She isn‚Äôt rude while responding to an anxious family member but accommodates for that in a visit. Restores my belief in the old school tradition that you can trust your doctor implicitly next to your family.

I had uterine polyp and was advised Hysterectomy by (hyper) gynecologists both in Nagpur and Bengaluru.She was the only gynecologist who gave me an option of Hysteroscopy. She was absolutely calm...a trait a patient seeks the most when you know surgery is inevitable....a thorough professional, i can say this because the routine internal examination did not cause any unease.
I was at crossroads because a gynecologist i had earlier met had recommended ' abdominal hysterectomy' as I am asthmatic!
Dr Aruna Murlidhar however suggested laprascopic hysterectomy and cleared any doubts i harboured.
Dr Aruna Murlidhar is the bee's knees when it comes to gynecological treatment.
