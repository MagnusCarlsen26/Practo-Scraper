"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Basavaraj for male infertility issues in October. At first, we found him very measured with his words and giving less time to a consultation.  Later we understood he is cautious, practical and scientific in his approach with treatment ie he wants to gather all the facts before suggesting a course of action.

At every step of the way, he explained to us the odds of success very candidly, which my husband and I appreciated. 

** *** *** ********* *** *********** ***** ** ************ His understanding of issues plaguing fertility is deep and reasoned. I never felt the need for a second or third opinion around him.

There was a time when we were nervous about embryo transfer, and he brought our faith up with his kind words “Don’t worry ma, itll be alright” :) ..

Thanks to his intervention, we conceived in 4-5 months end-to-end with our first try at IVf. 

The nurses and staff at his clinic are super well- trained at handling scans, injections, retrievals and transfers.  

A good doctor handling your case can impact your life’s outcomes, and Dr. Basavaraj sure did change ours for the better.

We are immensely thankful to him. We would recommend people facing the same issues to visit him without any hesitation.

Minor areas of improvement: 1) His clinic does have a big wait time, so pls be prepared for that and keep time with you handy when you go in. 

Since it is a life changing treatment, I did not view this negatively, but for some it can be frustrating. 

2) sometimes I felt our conversations can be more two-way than one way. For e.g. on precautions on exercise, I had a diff POV but not much time to express it…",2024-07-27 13:11:51,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

But, didn't succeed after spending lot of money on medicines and tests. Then we consulted Dr. Basavaraj after seeing positive review in internet. Doctor took step by step approach to treat the problem so that I could get a viable pregnancy. During the treatment I got pregnant for the first time in my life but unfortunately I misscarried in the initial phase itself. After that I had another miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Finally after one year of trying I was able to conceive without any issues and delivered a healthy baby boy few months back. During our treatment, we have full faith and trust on him. We believed that if I would ever get pregnant after so many issues, it would be with his treatment only. He is very calm, polite and sensitive person. He always gives time and courage to each patient to overcome any difficulty. We would like to recommend him for people who are struggling to conceive for long time. He is God to us.
