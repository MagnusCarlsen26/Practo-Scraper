"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Basavaraj for male infertility issues in October. At first, we found him very measured with his words and giving less time to a consultation.  Later we understood he is cautious, practical and scientific in his approach with treatment ie he wants to gather all the facts before suggesting a course of action.

At every step of the way, he explained to us the odds of success very candidly, which my husband and I appreciated. 

** *** *** ********* *** *********** ***** ** ************ His understanding of issues plaguing fertility is deep and reasoned. I never felt the need for a second or third opinion around him.

There was a time when we were nervous about embryo transfer, and he brought our faith up with his kind words “Don’t worry ma, itll be alright” :) ..

Thanks to his intervention, we conceived in 4-5 months end-to-end with our first try at IVf. 

The nurses and staff at his clinic are super well- trained at handling scans, injections, retrievals and transfers.  

A good doctor handling your case can impact your life’s outcomes, and Dr. Basavaraj sure did change ours for the better.

We are immensely thankful to him. We would recommend people facing the same issues to visit him without any hesitation.

Minor areas of improvement: 1) His clinic does have a big wait time, so pls be prepared for that and keep time with you handy when you go in. 

Since it is a life changing treatment, I did not view this negatively, but for some it can be frustrating. 

2) sometimes I felt our conversations can be more two-way than one way. For e.g. on precautions on exercise, I had a diff POV but not much time to express it…",2024-07-27 13:11:51,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
None,"Infertility,",0,0,YES,"We consulted Dr. Basavaraj at Vishvas clinic on our infertility problem for 9 years. We just met him based on the feedbacks which I read on the Internet. Dr Initially gave us the details of the treatment which are their, He explained IVF with ICSI process and cost involved in a very detailed manner and cleared all our queries. We started taking injections from Day 2 until Day 10 and he monitored the follicle growth periodically. He did all the scans and egg retrieval procedure himself. Successfully egg retrieval was done and fertilization happened and we got 6 embryos developed to blastocyst stage. As my hormone level is high, doctor suggested doing the embryo transfer after a month to avoid any complications.  While all these were in Process. He never gave us the false promises he usually answers to the point, he always checked on the conditions how I was responding and tried to build the confidence in us. This Confidence which he gave us brought the Belief within in us that sure we would have the success in the next cycle of the transfer. 
And now I am 10 wks pregnant which was a dream and Hope always when I had attend the other Fertility clinics where they cheated us with false treatment and false promises. Unlike other clinics This place does not talk about hope. This Place really boost you with the Belief. They rightly have the tag line BELIEVING IS EVERYTHING!!  as only when you Believe You can do it and He will help you to achieve your Dream. This Doctor is the one who will first make your self believe that you can do and he gets this done!!  I have seen there is Never NO… or IMPOSSIBLE word in his Clinic and It is always YES we can do it!!
He is having a very good team of nurses; He always gives you positive energy. We are lucky to get treated by him. I would definitely suggest people suffering with Infertility to consult him and be patience with the treatment process and protocols and you will succeed for sure.

Our Sincere thanks for Dr. Basavaraj *** *** *** ****** *** *** ****  Thank you for all the guidance and support till date. Wish You and your Family Always Be Happy!!

Dr. Basavaraj Devarashetty is that genius who made us believe in that. He is hands-down one of the best doctor we have ever met in our life! his demeanor and bed-side manner is calm, positive, thorough, attentive, flexible, and personal. Doctor  Basavaraj patient listener and builds your confidence. He has vast knowledge in the field and gives a detailed description of the issue. Doctor  BD went through all the investigation reports done earlier and shared the explanation for the ailment found in detail and guided us though towards the success. 

We met him when we lost all our hopes of having someone special in our life.. After having 3 failed IVF cycles ( elsewhere-with other esteemed, busy and money making doctors- do not wanted to criticize – but it’s truth  ) and going though immense mental and emotional pain we gave up.  We thought maybe it’s god’s wish and our destiny for not having someone special who we love and cherish for rest of our life. We never thought that we will have precious little miracles in life. We never thought that heaven has smiled down on us and though you. 

We can only see the god in our prayers but you know we met one.. yes and “in you” “in Dr. Basavraj Devarashetty” . Sir there are no words through which we can ever express our feelings, there are no words though which we even can thank you. You are genius and we cannot forget you for rest of our life. You made it possible for us..

Honestly, what a wonderful thing to have a doctor who actually cares about your feelings, and takes the time to explain his thinking. You are a great doctor, and when we think back to the days when we met you first we realize that we have taken one of the best and decision of our life. Our entire experience from our first visit to the moment we walked out the door with our two little angels was beyond positive.

I had visited after viewing feedback in practo but my experience was really bad.
I booked through practo and after I reached there had to wait for more than one hour.
I raised concern in practo that I am waiting from more than an hour and still waiting.
When I entered to the doctors room then he was so rude and was rudely telling me that it’s not vegetable market that you come and do checkup.You have to give time and so many things he stared telling us.We was like what mistake we did.
We just raised concern from practo because no one in the clinic was telling us the exact time for our turn for consultation.
Now when we started telling our issue then instead of giving some solutions, he was telling something else and not given any proper solution.
It was like not value of money and I can say time which i spent there.My appointment time was 10.15 and I turn came at 11.15. I already had another appointment so I wanted my consultation should be done as per my slot.Instead of understanding our time, he started behaving very rudely and without getting any proper solution we left the clinic.

He never pushed us for necessary tests or expensive treatments. Within 2 months under his medication we got lucky.
Agree there is too much of waiting time but I have seen the doc still seeing each and every patient and giving good amount of time.
My personal exp: Once there was too much of rush so support staff asked me to come next day but I asked them to show my file as he asked me come on particular day (when ovulating even hours counts). After seeing my file he told he will scan me on the same day, and he was there in the clinic till 10:30 PM.

Dr. Basavaraj Devarashetty is one of the best doctor I have ever met in my life.He is very simple patient listener and down to earth person. He is always available for any doubts and whenever we go for consultation he made us very comfortable. I have met him in the year of 2013 for the first time when I was unable to conceive naturally. He saw all the reports which I have done earlier and asked me to do some scanning. After that he explained the real problem that I am having and gave the suggestion. He suggested me to go for ET-IVF,but I was not ready for it. That time I didn't know that only one option i.e IVF is left for me. Then I have tried Ayurvedic treatment and visited Motherhood hospital too but it doesn't workout. In Motherhood hospital one of the doctor told me that my uterus is not visible and even IVF also not possible in my case. I was shocked. That time I took the best decision in my life i. e to go back to CloudNine and meet Dr. Basavaraj  Devarashetty. Again he welcomed me with a smile and recognized me. He checked my all the reports and asked now  R you ready for IVF. I said yes. He explained all the procedures and the cost of IVF. With the God's grace and the experience of the doctor, in the first cycle  itself I got positive result. This could happen only because of the best treatment given by the doctor. Now I am blessed with a baby boy.                          Dr. Basavaraj Devarashetty is really a GOD to our family. With his best treatment we have become parents. Doctor there are no words to explain our feelings and to thank u. You are really a great doctor and we cannot forget you for rest of our life. Thank u thank u so much doctor.                                                  I would definitely recommend him for the people who are having fertility problem.

He never suggested unnecessary tests and medications. After few tests, he suggested ICSI. I still remember his reassuring words after I almost gave up. He said this process needs only one good sperm and not many. So he said that you don't need to worry when someone has less or poor sperm count . Those reassuring words turned to be very powerful and true towards the end for me. When the actual procedure was done, only one embryo survived out of 18 and that's because only one sperm turned out to be of good quality. His words turned out to be golden words for me and I became thankful to this great doctor forever as I have a cute son on my lap today. He turned 1 year. He has already started walking and speaking 😊 My life has become much more beautiful after the arrival of my son and I have a new meaning for this life. No money could compensate for the changes he brought in my life. Thank you very much doctor. Long live Dr. Basavaraj and long live your service.

People generally talk about waiting time, but I would say that his treatments are life changing events and waiting time for this doctor is just worth it. ",2018-10-07 07:16:13,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
