It was right decision to visit her. It was great experience as I have delivered healthy baby through normal vaginal delivery (NVD)  on 20 may 2021. During pandemic, I was struggling to get good Gyn then my friend asked to visit her, started my consultation from third month with Dr Mamtha. She is very knowledgeable, experienced and friendly as well as approachable though Whatsapp, which made my pregnancy journey more smooth during covid time. I was not particular till last moment that I will be having baby by normal or c section. Doc was sure that she will take care if it's normal or c section. Baby was having head in pelvic area, she decided to go for normal. I had full term baby (39 week 5 days). I was getting contraction irregularly so visited doc on 19 may, my water broke the moment I reach to hospital. I got admitted and she had made my admission process smooth. She monitored me for 3-4 hour and gave one harmone injection which will increase pain and contractions regular (as there was no need to inject pain) . I was shifted to labor room after 4 hours then pain was unbearable so gone ahead with epidural ( doc asked if u can bear pain then u may avoid the epidural injection but if u think it's unbearable go ahead. Dilation was only 3 cm only ) I chose for epidural with less dose so my pain was reduced for only 3 hours then I had very painful labor pain till midnight. She has coordinated with entire team and gave couple of more injection to make dilation faster and cervix smooth. This was really needed as after epidural also dilation was only 5 cm. She has prepared the entire team for delivery in midnight when dilation was 8 cm. She came to labour room in midnight when I was almost ready, her Cloudnine team was ready too with full preparation. Doc along with her team and my husband ( who was present during entire delivery and that's a best part) has helped me to push the baby down, at the end I lost my energy and my baby’s head was stuck in cervix. Then there was one sister who was another a angel to me, she has pushed the baby out from her hand by hitting hard above my tummy. Everyone was shouting that I shall try more otherwise vaccume will be used as baby heartbeat was going down. I got scared and Thank God I was able to push the healthy baby out.IFinally I had given birth to wonderful beautiful daughter :) Thanks to doc Mamtha, her entire Cloudnine HRBR Team.

She spends enough time during visits to clarify our doubts and is also available over phone anytime we reach out to her.I always feel safe and secure when i visit her.Also, I had informed mam about my preference of Normal Vaginal delivery from the beginning- she was very practical and during labour- she didn’t force anything on to us.she was calm and very positive and this is her best quality. There was a complication where the amiotic fuild level was going down during 37th week of my pregnancy and there was a single loop of cord around my baby neck.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"At 35 and the history of a miscarriage, my pregnancy started off with all possible challenges. Barring the mishap, I was sure my third pregnancy was going to be easier but boy was I in for a huge surprise! I was put on hormonal tablets to sustain the pregnancy from the get go. Around  13 weeks when I met Dr. Mamtha, my cervix length was a big concern, it was 3 cm. I was immediately advised complete bed rest and regular scans and injections. Doctor kept tabs on the cervix length! To add to this I had nausea and constipation to the highest degr. I would message and call her often and she was always there for me. 

Dr. Mamtha was always prepared to see any anomaly through, she prepared me for a pre term delivery as it was quite imminent. Luckily and with all the efforts of the doctor and my family, I carried my daughter till 39 weeks. I had a huge fibroid around 10cm which was obstructing the babys head to fix into the pelvis. But she was very sure of trying the best for a vaginal birth and even a c section would have proven tasking due to my fibroid. 

My amniotic fluid was lesser than expected at 39 weeks and so was induced labour. From the time I was induced, the doctor hand held me throughout my labour. Dr. Mamtha did everything to speed up my labour and when she saw that i was exhausted and wasn't dilating fast enough, she suggested that i take an epidural and sleep for a couple of hours. It was the best decision ever to have taken, my nap in the labour ward is my best nap so far! When I woke up after 2 hours or so, my contractions were strong and Dr. Mamtha and her entire team was ready to deliver my baby. Within a few pushes, she helped my baby out, despite my babys head still not being in the apt position! 

Dr. Mamtha, being so thorough and knowledgeable, is surprisingly humble, friendly and approachable! I was so at ease with her within a few minutes of our first meeting. She doesn't fuss about a quick scan or an overnight call. She made sure I was informed of delays in appointments if she was in emergency cases. Also, the day my daughter was born was the doctors birthday, yet she was there from midnight till the wee hours of the morning. She visited me multiple times after the delivery to check on my recovery. Im so so grateful that God put me with the most capable hands! ",2022-10-22 17:08:04,False,True,HARINI V R RAO,,,
