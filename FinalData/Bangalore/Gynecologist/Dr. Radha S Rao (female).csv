"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"We went to Dr. Radha after taking treatment from another doctor in one of the leading women's hospital on Sarjapura road. We visited the doctor there for close to a year.  We were having problem in conceiving the child. After many months of trying, the other doctor gave up and asked us to visit fertility clinic in Kormangala. We did visit the fertility clinic and they advised advanced techniques IVF without actually confirming whether there is really a problem or not. After this point, somebody gave us the contact of Dr. Radha Rao. 
In the first visit itself Dr. Radha said (I remember very clearly)  we will have go through 6 complete cycles before we jump to any conclusion. Also she said we will have to keep track of things with regular medical tests to understand what is happening. She was very much in control of the situation and confident of her skill from the very start. This tracking helped because in the first very  cycle the problem was found and rectified. We completed the whole 9 month time period under her guidance and found her way of working very good. She never created fear or urgency to get any extra medical tests done. On the contrary she told us the need of medical tests and the importance to our particular case. There is a test during the second trimester that cost 40,000/- Rupee and is applicable only to couples where the lady's age is above 34-35 years. She did categorically told us that it is applicable to situations where lady is of higher age and is not necessary in our case. Similar she gave the correct opinion on stem cell banking as well. 
Overall I would recommend Dr. Radha to every body. We stay good 15 km away from Jaya Nagar and the visits to the doctor took full one working day (She does not practice on weekend)  because of traffic and tiredness of travel.

Most importantly, she is not one of those doctors who pushes for c-sections. Even though my baby was in full breech position, she got me to wait till 39th week and then did a c-section - that too since i developed severe rashes.
