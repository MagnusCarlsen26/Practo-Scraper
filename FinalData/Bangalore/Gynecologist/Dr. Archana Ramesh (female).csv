"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Irregular Periods,",0,0,YES,I have been seeing Dr. Archana Ramesh since many years and even before she was working in Motherhood Hospital. When she stopped coming to sagar hospitals I basically searched where she is and found her in Motherhood. The consultation is high comparabily here but I prefer to see only Dr. Archana Ramesh for any Gyneacolgical related health issues. I feel extremely comfortable talking to her Because her patience settles me down and does not panic me. Very happy with her treatment as well. ,2019-11-13 17:16:30,False,True,Saroja,,,
