I'm really glad that we got in touch with Dr. Hira.Mardi from the 1st day of my pregnancy and have been consulting her since last 9 months. This was my1st pregnancy and it was high risk as I had medical complications but because of Dr. Hira Mardi's treatments, availability, caring nature, guidance, and 24/7 availability made my high risk pregnancy very smooth. We wanted normal delivery, and Dr. Hira Mardi did everything in her hands to support my decision. Due to low hemoglobin and other medical complications we had to induce labour 2 weeks early for the safety of our baby. I was in labour for almost 30 hours and Dr. was always there checking on me. I couldn't bare the labour pain n had to switch to c-section.. The operation went really smooth.. we had our baby girl delivered at Cloudnine.  

I highly recommend Dr. Hira Mardi for anyone who is looking for an amazing ObGyn for their pregnancy journey.
