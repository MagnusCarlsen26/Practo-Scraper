"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"I so wanted to write the feedback about Dr.Madhulika Bhattacharya and even though I am busy coping up with my newborn I couldn’t control writing about this kind ,genuine, honest doctor.

Unlike other big doctors, she will be available 24/7 on text messages and wtsapp in case you have any issues ,you can reach out to her and she is very prompt in her response .I was lucky to have chosen her for my pregnancy and I can say it was my bestest decision. I fall short of words telling about her but definitely I suggest all the pregnant women to consult Dr. Madhulika to make their pregnancy a beautiful experience!!My birth story goes like this-
I was admitted on 19th March and had pains whole night and in the morning while I was not able to take the pain around 9 am we called the doctor and requested her for C-section but  she completely denied that and kept motivating me instead for normal delivery  even though me and my husband begged her so much. She was firm that I will be able to deliver normal in 30 to 45 minutes and the same happened. Even if I say 1000 times thanks to her also it is less. I will always be very very grateful to her and she is the most amazing gynecologist I have ever met!!

She delivered my baby boy through csect (dilation wasn't enough and water had already broken) although she will push u for normal delivery unlike other doctors. In the OT i kinda panicked seeing all the surgical instruments, dr held my hand and struck a conversation calmed me down, gave me words of encouragement.

I first consulted her (in Cloudnine) for pre-pregnancy counselling since I was above 35 and it is termed as high risk pregnancy.

Also that it is not a magical number post which our health starts declining and problems suddenly crop up, it is more a factor of overall fitness and lifestyle. I felt a lot more confident hearing this and she also suggested taking some tests and scans before planning which I did. 

I would prepare lots of questions before every consultation and she would patiently answer them. She was always available on mails for any additional questions/ concerns or advise. Throughout my pregnancy she gave me a lot of positive vibes. While discussing my delivery options, she clearly laid out the pros and cons keeping my medical history in mind, let us decide and supported our decision.
