But this time I thought I should really do it because this would really help someone.we were married for 5 years and planned to have baby after 2 years of marriage.we both are really good health and usually we have very healthy lifestyle. we do practice yoga stress free life. inspite of all this we struggled to conceive for 3 years with no valid medical reasons.
Someone from our friends circle suggested us to meet Sumana mam. when we met her she examined all our reports and suggested to go for IUI. we tried it, it didnt work then we  took a break for 6 months and then decided to go for IVF. And its the success in 2 nd attempt.
