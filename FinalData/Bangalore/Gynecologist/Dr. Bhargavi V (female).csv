You both were hesitant and were not able to ask the exact question or the information you are looking for - you two were asking same questions repeatedly - it is humanly impossible for me to assume unless you ask me clearly - that is the main reason I asked you couple to visit in person
Sensitive queries as you mentioned is exactly why you need to visit a doctor in person and can’t be addressed online.
