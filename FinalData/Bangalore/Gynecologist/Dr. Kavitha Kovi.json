She always used to make me feel relaxed if i was taking tension for very small things in my pregnancy . She listens patient very calmly. She gives best medications available in the world. Best part of her was , from my third trimester onwards she used to ask me in each visit about my exercises , physical workout and walk so that i can deliver normal. Her focus is always on normal delivery. I was impatient in my last days and was thinking to give up for normal pregnancy, but she asked to wait till my due date and did not let me get admitted for c sec. I am grateful to mam for lifetime. *** ***** ** **** ************* ** ********** Most important part of her is she always responds through message. so in your pregnancy if you feel anything wrong even in midnight, she will respond whenever she sees msgs  and give the right treatment. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb   Finally I gave normal birth with her support.

During the procedure she made me feel relaxed ,normally other doctors go with a serious face during procedures but she was confident and clear in what she does. Memories of my second pregnancy and delivery are beautiful and she plays a major role in that \ud83d\ude42 Even after 7 months she is still reachable over messages if we have any doubts \ud83d\ude42 ",

She always used to make me feel relaxed if i was taking tension for very small things in my pregnancy . She listens patient very calmly. She gives best medications available in the world. Best part of her was , from my third trimester onwards she used to ask me in each visit about my exercises , physical workout and walk so that i can deliver normal. Her focus is always on normal delivery. I was impatient in my last days and was thinking to give up for normal pregnancy, but she asked to wait till my due date and did not let me get admitted for c sec. I am grateful to mam for lifetime. *** ***** ** **** ************* ** ********** Most important part of her is she always responds through message. so in your pregnancy if you feel anything wrong even in midnight, she will respond whenever she sees msgs  and give the right treatment. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb   Finally I gave normal birth with her support.

During the procedure she made me feel relaxed ,normally other doctors go with a serious face during procedures but she was confident and clear in what she does. Memories of my second pregnancy and delivery are beautiful and she plays a major role in that \ud83d\ude42 Even after 7 months she is still reachable over messages if we have any doubts \ud83d\ude42 ",

She is readily available on her personal watsapp for small & big clarifications. Highly professional, skilled in her field & has vast experience which is oblivious the way she handles her patients. Also,doesn\u2019t recommend unnecessary tests, scans,medicines & frequent consultations if everything seems normal to her which is uncommon these days. The great part is she doesn\u2019t let you overthink about any situation or about future. And makes you believe that everything is progressing in a normal  way. Moreover encourages you to enjoy the pregnancy journey, do what you like & take it easy with all necessary precautions.\n\nOur journey of birth was no less than a beautiful experience wherein i was not anticipating delivery at close to 37 weeks( 36+ 5 days).A day before my delivery we went to hospital after I experienced little brown discharge & pressure in lower abdomen. I was kept under supervision for few hours . All this time, she was aware of my condition through duty doctor & wanted everything to progress naturally. Also, made a visit in the end, explained the progress & was discharged same day. Following day, i had stronger contractions & passed blood filled mucus, and around the same time a day before, we made it to the hospital again after informing Kavitha Ma\u2019am . Little did we know that i was in labour & dilated already. I was told that it\u2019s just a matter of few hours for labour to progress. It was Sunday & Kavitha Ma\u2019am came rushing at the right time for delivery. Although in her absence, her team managed & prepared us well for the express delivery but when she entered the room, i was relieved to the core & knew it\u2019s going to be alright. Her presence in the room just gave me so much comfort in the midst of all contractions & pain. From reaching the hospital to delivering  a healthy baby boy vaginally with minimal intervention, it was just a matter of 2 hours. \n\nWe are eternally grateful & thankful to Dr Kavitha ma\u2019am for instilling the right kind of attitude & positivity that helped us sail through our pregnancy journey. Needless to say she is a POWERHOUSE and truly dedicated to her role as an OBGYN. We hope & pray that she is blessed with good health & happiness in utmost abundance.",

Even though my first delivery was a C -section, and there was a mismatch in my blood group being B-ve and my son being O ve, she helped me to do a Normal Vaginal Delivery  which was highly impossible in my case.The delivery went smoothly, and I felt very well cared for by her and her team. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a gynecologist focused on normal delivery.Words are not enough to thank her for the special, excellent care she had provided and for the unique gift she gave me. I am blessed that she is  my doc! I have great confidence in her and her abilities. Thank you so much for the great care and  for helping me perform a normal delivery. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd17",

Your expertise and quick decision-making ensured a smooth and safe delivery for both me and our baby. \n\nYour presence in the delivery room brought a sense of comfort and reassurance during what can be an overwhelming experience. Your dedication to your patients is truly commendable.\n\nThanks to your exceptional care, we are now blessed with a healthy baby, and we couldn't be more grateful. Your role in bringing our little one into the world will always be remembered with fondness and appreciation.\n\nMy journey:\nDelivery pain was not started at home, we visited Aster Hospital, where pain was induced by Kavitha mam, and it was a 12-hour labor pain journey, out of which 8 to 9 hours journey was tolerable because of an epidural. The last 2 hours were a little hectic, but you feel it is worth, it once the baby is delivered and lying on you.\n\nWe are blessed with a baby boy. \n\nTo all upcoming moms,\nCongratulations on your pregnancy journey. Wishing you a good luck. Please have some patience for normal delivery and trust Kavitha mam and her well-trained team. \n\n\nTo all upcoming dads,\nYou may find, out where is Dr. Kavitha mam during your wife's labor pain, but trust her, have some patience,  She is actively monitoring her patient through the duty doctor, and in between labor also, she will visit and provide encouraging words, She will definitely arrive at the right time for delivery of the baby.  She is very sensitive towards new moms.  \n\n\n\nAfter delivering my baby, I can only say, I was in the safe hands of Kavitha Kovi. Wishing a good health for Kavitha's Mam. Once again, thank you, Dr. Kavitha Mam's team, for your outstanding care, expertise, and compassion. You have made a lasting impact on our lives, and we are forever grateful.\n\nWith heartfelt thanks and warm regards,\nMonika",

At the time of delivery, she arrived early in the labour room and although my wife was tired due to labour pain, Mam gave lots of confidence and energy to my wife to put in more energy and had a successful delivery of the baby. \n\nWe got to know about Dr.Kavitha Kovi mam through word of mouth from friends and fellow flat residents and they all had fantastic reviews about mam. They were not wrong.. She is really hardworking and I even wondered how mam even gets time to rest and always greets everyone at the top of her energy. \n\nIf you are consulting for pregnancy at Aster Hospital the blindly for for consultation with  Dr.Kavitha Kovi mam.",

Her vast knowledge and experience in obstetrics were evident at every appointment, providing me with a sense of confidence and trust in her care.\n\nWhile there can sometimes be a wait to see Dr. Kovi during her outpatient clinic hours, this is a small price to pay for the level of expertise and attention she offers.

I really got impressed with her friendly nature and her immediate response to any of my doubts. She will be available for the phone calls, messages. Listens to even very small issues and gives detailed info. \n\nI was at 37th week, went for regular follow-up. While reviewing growth scan, it is mentioned that, biles are more so, need to do one more scan again after a week since blood supply was little lower to baby because of biles. It was time to decide on whether delivery in week or will go for weekly base scans. She suggested to go for delivery. Now, things like, normal or cc-section. She told, just try for normal delivery based on baby weight. It could be very casual, for normal pregnant women, but for my case, it is bit diffult because, has cardiact related issues plus autoimmune issue. However, She taken the decision to make it normal deverly.\n\nAt time of delivery, It was becoming more complicated and not because of my health condition but it is because of my baby gained weight in a week. Irrespective of my health conditions or unexpected circumstances, She did the normal delivery. Now, we both are doing fine. I am really thankful to Dr. Kavitha Kovi mam. I will appreciate her patience and commitment. She had met with me after delivery in hospital when I was there for my baby follow-up and asked for my health and given medications on the fly. \n\nI will highly recommend Dr. Kavitha Kovi mam. ",

Before delving into my birth story, I wanted to express my sincerest gratitude for the exceptional care and support you provided during my pregnancy journey.\n\nAt 28 weeks pregnant, I encountered a significant challenge when diagnosed with a kidney stone. Despite initial treatment from both a urologist and a gynecologist at a prestigious multispecialty hospital, complications arose as I developed an infection around the stent placed in the ureter area. Despite their best efforts, the infection persisted, prompting me to seek a second opinion.\n\nThankfully, fate led me to your expertise at the Conceive clinic, where I met Dr. Kavitha Kovi. From the moment I walked into your clinic, I felt reassured by your confidence and dedication to resolving my medical issues. Your assurance in treating the kidney stone and removing the stent, coupled with your comprehensive approach and valuable references, instilled in me a newfound sense of hope.\n\nUnder your guidance, the kidney stone was successfully treated and removed by an experienced urologist, alleviating my concerns and paving the way for a smoother pregnancy journey. Throughout the remaining weeks of my pregnancy, your unwavering support and expertise ensured a sense of calm and confidence, which I will forever be grateful for.\n\nSince then, I have been exclusively consulting Dr. Kavitha for my pregnancy. Under her guidance, the last few weeks of my pregnancy went smoothly, and I felt reassured by her expertise and dedication.\n\nDuring delivery, my water broke at 11:20 PM, and I had a normal vaginal delivery at 11:35 PM the next day. Throughout the 24-hour period, Dr. Kavitha and her team managed everything efficiently. Despite moments of pain and my requests for a C-section, they continuously encouraged me to do breathing exercises. Their steadfast commitment to my well-being never wavered, ultimately resulting in a successful vaginal delivery of a healthy baby.\n\nWords cannot adequately express my gratitude for the exceptional care you provided during such a pivotal moment in my life. Your patience, motivation, and unwavering support were invaluable, and I am forever grateful for the positive impact you've had on my pregnancy journey.\n\nThank you, once again, for your outstanding care and dedication.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nDivyasree Sabbu",

It was a moment of joy for sure but this was my first child and like many of you who are going to be a first time mother, I had so many apprehensions and fears in my mind about how I am going to go through this. \n\nI did research on all the hospitals in Bangalore, read over hundreds of reviews and chose Dr. Kavitha Kovi for two primary reasons. As per the reviews, she was the kind of doctor who makes your life going through pregnancy much easier and she promotes natural delivery. \n\nI was very nervous visiting a gynaecologist imagining all sorts of do\u2019s and dont\u2019s and all the medicine I would get prescribed and whether she will treat me with empathy. And the moment I entered her cabin, the sheer smile on her face and the calmness in her voice evaporated all my anxieties and I felt I am in the right place. And I was right. Dr. Kovi isn\u2019t just a great gynaecologist but she is also a wonderful woman who is very ethical in her prescriptions and compassionate in her treatment. From that point on to the night in the delivery room when I was getting nervous with all the pain and was requesting for C-Section, she kept encouraging me to go for completely natural delivery. She even advised against inducing or applying suction. And she helped me normalise the pain with her encouraging words. During the entire pregnancy, she just kept me on Iron and Calcium and everytime I complained of experiencing pain or nausea or blackouts or a dozen other things, she patiently handled it and asked me to just go through it and assured me that it\u2019s all normal and that I don\u2019t need any medicines. \n\nGood Doctors prescribe right medicines, great doctors know that avoiding too many drugs is the right thing. \n\nI could go on and write pages about her but I have to say this in a nutshell. If you are an expecting mother and you have Dr. Kovi on your side, trust me you have the best care you can get. \n\nThank you Doctor Kavitha Kovi Mam for making this journey so much easier for me.

Before I met Dr. Kavitha, I was diagnosed with IHCP (Intra Hepatic Cholastasis of pregnancy) in my 5th month when I was with Cloud 9. Doctor in Cloud 9 whitefield completely ignored my symptoms of IHCP which lead to very high Bile Acid content, that causes liver damage and severe itching.\nI was restless with no sleep. I was also informed that my case is of Caesarian Delivery only, and mostly every meeting she created more panic for me and my baby\u2019s life.\n\n  I was recommended by many around me to consult Dr. Kavitha in Aster. \n- Day 1 she assured me of Normal Delivery.\n- All symptoms were heard and acknowledged.\n- She gave me medication to reduce itching.\n- She gave me confidence to be prepared for a healthy delivery, healthy me and baby \n- Her experience is so great that everything in my case happened as per her predictions:\n\u2022 Natural labor within the date mentioned \n\u2022 Fast and easy dilation \n\u2022 Delivery within 4 to 5 hours of labor \n\u2022 Normal Delivery \n\nBaby and mother both healthy and fine. I can\u2019t thank her enough \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nBeware of C-section scams elsewhere. Visiting Dr. Kavitha once brings confidence in patients. \n\n",

She does not let you overthink about any situation and make you feel comfortable and enjoy the process of pregnancy.\n\nI strongly recommend Kavitha mam based on my experience.\n\nMy experience:\nI have joined in the hospital on EDD by 6pm evening and I was induced for labour and pains started around 9pm in this time team has supported constantly and they were checking on me and available on time and Kavitha mam rushing to the hospital for the delivery at the right time even though it\u2019s mid night . In her absence her team supported and guided me for the express delivery once Kavitha man entered labour room I was relieved and her presence gave me so much comfort in the midst of pain and contractions.it was just matter of 4 hours finally delivered healthy baby girl vaginally with minimum intervention.\n\nWe are eternally grateful to the Kavitha mam through out my life.\n",

I feel so confident and enthusiastic after every meet with Ma\u2019am. She is very caring, calm and energetic. I love the way she boost confidence. Moreover, ma\u2019am is available on WhatsApp for any small questions. My complete 37 weeks were worry free except last week because fluid was very less. Despite of less fluid ma\u2019am asked me to try for NVD but it didn\u2019t work and went for C section. Ma\u2019am made my delivery experience exceptionally awesome. My husband was waiting outside of OT and was afraid as I was going for C section but when ma\u2019am saw him she asked him to get inside the OT. He was sitting beside me and supporting me. It was most adorable moment for me and my husband.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how smooth process was throughout pregnancy. A big thank to Ma\u2019am.\nAlso, I would like to thank Dr. Kafi Bora(radiologist) ma\u2019am and everyone who sits at reception. Special thanks to Mrinalini.\n\nI would definitely recommend Kavitha Ma\u2019am, Kafi Bora Ma\u2019am.",

I had normal delivery at 38weeks just like she assured me. Normal delivery after c-section I have never imagined, but she made it happen. I'm always grateful to her for taking such a good care. She is always reachable to any queries and she handled complex pregnancy cases. I definitely recommend her.",

That day in Aster Women's and Children's Hospital, with Dr. Kavitha Ma'am and her incredible team, that emotional rollercoaster transformed into a journey of unwavering support and overwhelming love.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, Dr. Kavitha's Blooming smile: and gentle demeanor exuded warmth and confidence. Even during a busy day, she always made us feel like her top priority, patiently answering every question and easing our anxieties. Her assistants, Mirinalini and the rest of the staff, mirrored her kindness and efficiency, seamlessly guiding us through every step.\n\nDuring the crucial scanning sessions, Dr. Kafi Bora and Dr. Vidhya Priya were the calming voices in the storm, thoroughly explaining each image and addressing every concern. Their expertise reassured us that our little one was in the best hands.\n\nMy delivery, due to our baby's unexpected size, became slightly complicated. Witnessing my mother's worry, Dr. Kavitha stepped in not just as a doctor, but as a comforting friend. Her calm words and unwavering confidence calmed the storm within us, allowing us to focus on the task at hand.\n\nThe entire delivery process was a testament to the dedication and teamwork of Dr. Kavitha and her staff. Each member played a vital role, in ensuring a smooth and safe arrival for our precious child. Their professionalism, combined with their genuine care and emotional support, made it an experience we will cherish forever.\n\nAs we embark on this new chapter of parenthood, we are eternally grateful for Dr. Kavitha Ma'am and her amazing team. They not only delivered our baby, but also delivered a miracle of hope, joy, and unwavering support.\n\nIn particular, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my wife, Anurenjini, who braved this journey with immense courage and grace. Watching her strength and resilience was an inspiration throughout the entire process.\n\nThank you, Aster Women and Children, for giving us the greatest gift of all \u2013 a healthy baby and a lifetime of memories filled with love, gratitude, and a touch of magic.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAshwini Kumar Mathur, husband of Anurenjini",

This journey was made immeasurably better thanks to the unparalleled dedication and expertise of Dr. Kavitha Kovi.\n\nFrom the onset of my pregnancy, Dr. Kovi was a beacon of hope and reassurance. After exploring various hospitals during my first month of pregnancy, deciding to continue my journey with Dr. Kovi was a decision that my family and I are profoundly grateful for. Her approach, blending empathy with professionalism, is truly commendable.\nThe labor was a grueling 18-hour battle, a testament to the unpredictability and challenges of childbirth. However, Dr. Kovi's unwavering commitment to ensuring a normal delivery, as per my earnest request, was nothing short of miraculous. Her efforts were beyond commendable, putting in more than 200% to honor my wishes, all while meticulously monitoring the vitals of my baby and myself. This delicate balance she maintained between striving for a natural birth and ensuring the utmost safety for both the baby and me speaks volumes of her expertise and experience.\nHer presence in the labor room was calming and empowering. It was evident that her skills are unparalleled, but what truly sets her apart is her ability to instill confidence in a first-time mother like me. She was the embodiment of patience and strength, guiding me through each phase of labor with a gentle yet firm hand.\\n\\nIn every sense of the word, Dr. Kavitha Kovi was an angel sent by God to deliver our little angel into this world. Her contribution to our lives cannot be merely summed up in words. She has been a pivotal part of one of the most significant moments of our lives, and for that, we will be eternally grateful.Thank you, Dr. Kovi, for not just being a doctor, but a true guardian angel during the most critical time of our lives. Your expertise, care, and compassion have left an indelible mark on our hearts.\nWith the deepest gratitude,\nArchana\n",

                "review_text": "We researched a lot about gynaecologists in and around whitefield and found Dr. Kavitha Kovi. I was 8 weeks pregnant then and had suffered a miscarriage earlier. Dr.Kovi thoroughly examined my medical history and thyroid issue. She gave us hope of having a healthy pregnancy and advised to be active and happy. I was suggested to do all the normal household chores throughout my pregnancy cautiously. I even travelled 1000kms without any difficulty in 8th month. This was possible because of the doctor's assurance and effective medication. My water broke in the doctor's room on my last scan. We panicked then as I was 2 weeks early. Dr.Kovi , like always, calmed us down, gave me confidence and strength to go into labor. I was immediatly put on Oxytocin and my contractions began. I was 5 cms dilated when contractions began getting more frequent and unbearable. That is when I asked for an Epidural. I knew Epidural would help me to bear the pain till I'm fully dilated and save my energy for the pushing. After nearly 8 hours of labor, I was fully dilated .and my baby girl was out with 8-9 pushes. I had normal vaginal delivery (NVD) that was possible only because of my doctor. Dr. Kavitha Kovi helped me to mentally prepare myself for the D day. She was always approachable and just a text away, never prescribed unnecessary tests or medication, gave me a memorable and pleasant pregnancy throughout. The whole staff at Aster hospital Whitefield Bangalore is kind and co-operative. Everyone in my labour room encouraged and cheered me to push which boosted my energy and confidence.  So folks in and around Whitefield , please do consider her when you need.",

Gave us a right direction to take care for the well being of would be mother. On 08 November my  wife experience labour pain and I admitted her in Aster hospital, as her labour pain is getting increased with time, she was not able to tolerate it and demanded c -section, but doctors and nurses in the hospital treat her so patiently and guide her how to deal with the pain, they treated her gently, calmed her and encouraged my wife to coperate for normal delivery as it is best for her and she can recover soon..only because of their endless effort and my wife courage of dealing with this unbearable labour pain, my wife gave birth to a healthy baby with normal delivery and both of them are in good health..hospital keep them for 3 days after this.

Dr. Kavitha provides accurate and insightful assessments of patients' conditions, avoiding unnecessary fearmongering over minor issues.\n\nIn my 37th week of pregnancy, I was diagnosed with dengue and admitted to Aster almost immediately. The subsequent nine days were arduous, characterized by a significant drop in platelet levels to below 10,000 and the onset of false labor pains. However, Dr. Kavitha closely monitored my condition throughout this challenging period. It was a life-threatening situation for both me and my baby but thanks to her able guidance and follow-up care, I was able to overcome it. I am eternally grateful for her expertise and dedication.\n\nShe is an exceptional individual whose contributions are beyond measure. My gratitude to her is immeasurable, and words fall short in expressing my appreciation. I highly recommend her.",

She always attend her patients with a smile. That gives you the most positive vibes.\nThe second thing is her confidence which she instills in her patients. I am the first time mother and was bothered with so many questions, doubts. But she always addressed them with a smile and gave confidence about the whole joirney.\nShe really made this journey really smooth and enjoyable\nUnder her giudance only i had a baby boy via normal delivery.\nI am very very happy and satisfied that i consulted her and i dont think any other doctor would have made me this comfortable throughout.\nI would definitly recommend her to everyone.\n",

Definitely, we were anxious, worried as we were told that the delivery can only happen with the help of c-section due to lower weight of the baby.But once we met Kavita mam, she had cleared all our doubts, made my wife relaxed and suggested what to follow to try for normal delivery.Even on delivery date, looking at the pain of my wife,we agreed to go ahead with c-section but mam was quite calm and convinced us to wait for some more time as all the vitals were coming good for my wife and for the baby. Finally, on 16th of Jan'24, with God's grace and mam's support, my wife had delivered a healthy baby girl normally!We are so thankful to Mam and her team that I can't express it in words! Really greatful and once again thanks a ton mam!",

I had normal delivery just because dr really tried and didnt give up on me even when every other on duty doctor was suggesting for c section. Also, post delivery,  i recovered very quickly, all thanks to dr Kavitha. I would definitely recommend every pregnant women to trust dr Kavitha and follow her instructions,  and u will thank her at the end.  ",

There is simply a great sense of relief and confidence when you talk to her. The thing that stuck with us and gave us immense pleasure in seeing her was that in our very first appointment with her she said and I quote, \"Enjoy your pregnancy and let me guide and worry about the rest\". \n\nShe is very engaging and clear in her recommendations. She ensured all the time that we were taken care of irrespective of whether we were seeing her via an appointment or via ad-hoc doubts or questions that we could reach out to her via whatsapp/call/message. \n\nNow coming to the main day of delivery. Since the beginning she had advised for a normal delivery and facilitated the same with the correct diet and exercises. She beautifully laid out a plan and ensured that I delivered normally. Please note that mine was a complicated normal delivery since the baby came out face upwards to the ceiling instead of downwards to the floor. But even then she and her staff handled it very nicely without any issues to me or the baby.\n\nPost delivery I had constipation issues which is usual for a normal delivery and she once again guided how to get rid of it. She flipped my diet and said we are modern and working moms and the heavy on ghee, Dalia, khichdi diet is ancient and will cause more problems than it will solve. She recommended that I ate absolutely normal and that readily solved my constipation problem too.\n\nOverall, I would recommend her to any expecting couple for peace of mind and great guidance. \n\nThanks a lot Dr. Kavitha Kovi, we would forever be grateful.",

She just wanted to finish as many patients as possible by giving 2-3 mins of time to each one. So to get a decent pregnancy care, we started consulting with Dr Kavitha in Aster hospital. \n\nIn the first visit itself, we were so happy after the consultation. She listened to all our queries patiently and answered each one till we were full convinced. She even used notepad to draw/write and explain. She also had some printed set of documents with detailed Q&A which was also quite helpful and can be studied in our own time. \n\nSome of her unique traits are her friendliness, patience and definitely her knowledge and experience.  We felt like we created a bond during that pregnancy period.  Initially I was very worried whether the delivery would happen naturally or using C-section. She instilled that confidence in me and prepared me physically and mentally for delivering naturally. We followed religiously all her instructions and ended up delivering naturally toward the end of nine months.\n\nAround the end of nine months, I received mild pain and then after checking with Dr Kavitha, I got admitted in Aster. She performed the delivery and we were blessed with a cute and healthy baby girl.  The efforts and clarity she provided during the delivery also very commendable. \n\nThe effort Dr Kavitha puts for each of her patient is admirable. I wish her all the best in life and career and hope she will continue to bless many more couples who visits her and helps to bring more and more happy and healthy lives into this world. \n\nIf you want an awesome experience during your delivery care, you should definitely visit Dr Kavitha. Her experience, knowledge, friendliness, care is unmatchable.  Visit to doctors has now a days has become so transactional but thanks to doctors like Dr Kavitha who still treats patience with utmost personal care and bonding.\n\nDr Kavitha, Thank you so much again for bringing our daughter to this world safe and healthy.\n",

We consulted her for second opinion as there were some anamolies in the baby and our primary doctor had advised pregancy termination. The way Kavitha Mam had consoled us and explained the red flags ignored, we were well convinced to have her as our gynecologist for next pregnancy. In Aug '22 , with Kavitha Mam's constant support and god's grace, my wife had normal delivery and we have been blessed with baby girl.\nKavitha Mam always gave special attention during entire pregnancy and from very beginning explained us about probable complications/situations and course of treatment . My wife had short cervix for which Kavitha Mam had intimated us on stitches that might be required ,if it shortened further. However, she didn't rush into doing it and neither was it required till the end. She is so well experienced with high risk pregnancies that her judgment and articulation always came to be true in our case.During 2nd trimester , gestational diabetes came up in test results but Mam handled the situation quite well and also referred us to a good endocrinologist. This resulted in good control over sugars in time without impacting the baby.\nOne of other many traits that built our confidence in her was that unlike many other doctors, she had been very prompt over whatsapp to clear any doubt and handle any SOS condition.\nFor delivery also , she constantly encouraged my wife for normal. She is a great doctor and always thinks about wellbeing of her patients. Not only she is very empathetic towards her patients but we noticed that her approach towards out patients was also extremely genuine and she has great ethics as a doctor . She is one of the smartest doctors that i have met in my life. If anyone is looking for a great gynecologist who is highly experienced and confident about their job , please look no further and seek Mam's guidance without any second thought.",

We had a normal delivery with a healthy baby and it was all because of Dr Kavita Kovi.\nShe is highly experienced ,very knowledgeable and an honest doctor.Quite friendly though straight forward. She never miss guides you, sticks to reality and also a Myth breaker. Whatever stories other doctors usually tell to scare you, she would scrap all of those and guide you in a way that will boost your confidence during the whole process and you won't worry about anything unnecessarily. In every meeting she explains you well about what to expect next and also prepares you for the same. Best thing is as your doctor she is always available for you, she does shares her personal no and ready to take your call any time for any such emergencies.\n\nEven though she is such a senior doctor , still used to spend lot of time with us during our regular visits.My husband used to have tons of questions and she would answer each one of them with patience, even the silliest ones.\nAnd never did I felt that she is the kind of doctor who would try to make use of every opportunity to make those extra bucks. On the other hand she used to help us with suggestions or alternatives which saved us from those extra expenses.\n\nShe allowed my husband in the labor room , who got a chance to witness the birth of our baby, and gave him the Happiest moment ever . We are so greatfull to her for delivering us  our biggest joy of life. Thank you so much doctor, nothing we can do to return whatever you did for us.",

I was polyhydraminous with problems in liver, however mam always advised me the course of action to tackle this in such a manner that it never scared me in the entire process. She is always supportive of normal delivery.She alongwith the aster hospital, nurses, staffs $& duty doctors were extremely helpful in my delivery process. Mam continued to encourage me during my labour and when needed mentioned her personal experience to ease my pain.

Many doctors tell you what to do without listening to patients but Dr. Kavitha always listened carefully and explained why it's happening and what to do for it. During pregnancy an emergency can occur any time and Dr. gave her number on day 1 and freely asked to message if and when required. Even without messaging, just the confidence that I have the Dr's number calmed me down. Although she always replied to my queries within minutes. \nShe always guided me to have an appropriate diet and exercise routine which made me stronger. She did dietary interventions whenever required which helped a lot to keep the parameters in check.\nShe is also updated on modern and upcoming medicines and techniques and embraces the technology along with the good old natural birthing practices. \n\nDuring the labor time also Dr was composed and clear with the instructions and helped me get through it. \n\nDuring early pregnancy she had mentioned delivery should be a pleasant memory which mothers should remember always and she has stood true to that. \nThere is no one else I would recommend for a Gynac. \n\nThe title of Best gynaecologist, I would also like to add, The most elegant Gynaecologist in town. \n\nThank you for the best time and memories which I will cherish forever.",

Even she is the last hope for the ones who are unable to conceive.\u00a0 After two miscarriages and a year after I was not able to conceive...and those earlier miscarriages took all my hope and I almost started to think that I won't be able to become a mother ever. That feeling was devastating and very depressing. Finally, after consulting with many reputed doctors and hospitals in Bangalore I found her. One thing I liked her in the first meet is, she is very straight forward. Unlike many doctors, she will never hide any complications and she will never give you false hope. On the other hand if you trust her she will go to extreme and will help you in all possible ways. You will also get a response whenever you are in urgent need, this is very important as during pregnancy sometimes we can't even wait for a day when something goes wrong or we feel uncomfortable somehow. \nToday I am a mother of 2 and both of my pregnancies were very complicated. In the first one doctor had to do a cervical stich and I was on bed rest for few months during my pregnancy. During the 2nd pregnancy, I had some complications during the later scan and the same doctor saved my baby from an abortion (which the radiologist suggested and scared me during the scan at Rainbow). Both my babies came out healthy and fine. \n\nI really can't imagine how my life would have been without my kids if I haven't met this doctor who is an angel in disguise. ",

Since my scan reports were normal throughout pregnancy.15 days prior to delivery, I had repeatedly requested to let us know her preferred hospital for delivery, as RxDx doesn't have delivery options. Doctor suggests Cloud Nine (Whitefield) and Rainbow, where I go with Cloud Nine being nearer to my residence. I go to Cloud Nine with her reference and pay the advance for booking the delivery package.Even 48 hours before delivery during my last visit at RxDx, she assured us her availability for delivery. The early morning when I started feeling the pain, we rushed to Cloud Nine and to my surprise, I was hearing a different doctor's name for my case from the hospital staff. When my husband messaged our Doctor about this confusion, she replied suggesting to get admission with this new Doctor and she would reach hospital in meantime. Our Doctor arrives almost on time when I had been screaming in pain from last two hours now. She spent 5 minutes with me, looking at my reports and silently left the place. Finally this new doctor did my delivery. Below is what I felt -1. Our doctor never felt necessary to inform me or my family ever for handing over this to another doctor. Not even during her last visit to the hospital.2. New Doctor got equally surprised when comes to know that we are not informed by our doctor about this change. 3. Would you ever like to interact even with the most qualified doctor on your delivery date whom you have never met?4. We could have chosen any other hospital in Bangalore based on our budget and preferences. Believing our doctor's availablity, we went for the hospital what she has suggested.5. It has hurted more when she never bothered to check with me even once, post the delivery.6. When complained this incident with hospital, they confessed the mistake and told the doctor is officially not associated with their hospital.Extremely bad experience.",

If someone asks me I would say 'keep calm n trust her'\nI went to the Dr Kavitha Kovi after getting a positive on the kit, she calculated the weeks and performed heart beat scan. Things went positively, she congratulated us... after the NT scan I was identified with notches... I was 24 yrs and she did not neglect anything... Eye to details... Everything went noticed... She gave medicines for it and withdrew me from it after things were normal in anomaly scan... I was depressed one day and went to her as I felt restless... She counseled me, empathized and motivated me... \nI had premature pains on a day of strict karnataka bandh... I went to hospital very early in the morning.. doctors who tried to come to hospital we're stopped n their cars were broken... She instructed junior doctor n came to hospital in ambulance in such extreme situation, treated me... I was hospitalized for 2 days and pains came into control... After 4 weeks when I just entered into 9th month I delivered a baby boy... She tried her best for normal delivery... I was not obsessed with normal delivery but she never gave up.. I had to be shifted to OT on emergency as I was not able to push- I was given anaesthesia for C-section after going through labour pains (on epidural of course) but she gave a final try on vacuum and it was successful... Motivating young mothers no one can beat her... I take my son to the same hospital for check ups n vaccination... She has always been polite n greeted me n my family well... \nSuch talented doctors are created by gods for mankind... I would always be thankful to her!\nHospitals n management might have some issues but one should not hold doctor responsible for it... \nI am writing this almost 2.5 yrs post delivery... People with neg feedbacks come forward but it is important for people with positive feedback to mention their experience here so that more people can benefit out of such talented doctors!\n\nThanks for Reading!",

We had consulted Doctor Kavita Kovi for both the kids delivery.During the first one till 28 weeks we were consulting with Doctor Kavita and later moved to the hometown where delivery has happened via C- Section. After six years For 2nd child also right from the time of conception through delivery it was with the doctor Kavita and delivery has happened on 25th Dec 2023  through Normal (VBAC). We were really happy that the delivery has happened through normal/vaginal even though first delivery was through the C section where we thought that it isn't possible at all. Throughout the period Doctor was very  clear in communicating things and setting right expectations to us and discussing things at right time. Always welcoming with nice smile , listening patiently to the concerns, responding via what's app whenever required, prescribing tablets to what is needed, never over promising, everything was really good and perfect with the Doctor. I would 100% recommend Doctor Kavita Kovi for any Gynec issues or Pregnency related  treatments. ",

The whole journey from then onwards was so wonderful as i was always guided with her expertise and a lovely smile and positiveness. She has such a lovely aura that whenever i met her i used to get so calm and confident. she never recommended unnecessary medicines, scan and tests. Due to sudden water break but no other labour symptoms, i got admitted for emergency c-section and within 2hrs my baby girl came to the world. Ot experience was also good as ma'am was sharing her expert knowledge with her subordinates as well as her personal experiences with me. I would really recommend Dr. Kavita kovi ma'am to anyone who wants to have a relaxed, confident and lovely pregnancy journey experience. I am forever thankful to her. ",

We are utmost satisfied with the way how madam is treating the patient. We are really blessed to get treated by Kavitha Ma'm.  \nComing to our story,  we had our 1st pregnancy loss in cloud nine Whitefield hospital due to SCH issue which developed in 3rd month with 2.6 cm cervix length and the doctors there told us not to worry but ignoring  / not treating the cervix incompetency issue led to a miscarriage at 5th month. Then we decided to look for another doctor in another hospital and then we came across Dr. Kavitha Kovi ma'm in Aster. And to our surprise even in our 2nd pregnancy the same SCH issue and short cervix length of 2.6 cm is observed . we are again distressed, but this time we were advised by Kavitha madam to undergo cervical encirclage(stitch) . After this small operation our pregnancy really went well and in 37th week we have got our baby delivered hale and healthy through C-section due to breach position.\n\nMadam is Very Patient.  Takes very good care of her patients. She made us feel comfortable and confident that our baby is in safe hands. \nDespite of the fact that madam is quite busy with OP and deliveries. She is always reachable over phone incase of emergencies. \nShe anticipates the questions which are going to be asked by patient. She will answer all our queries even if we forget at that moment in doctors room. \nNo unnecessaries Medications. \n\nHighly recommended doctor for Pregnancy around whitefield, Bangalore.",

And thank fully Kavitha ma'am was beyond my dreams! From the first visit she made us feel comfortable, gave realistic next steps and made pregnancy feel like a breeze. She insists on leading a normal life that makes the entire journey so much more enjoyable. She does not prescribe any unnecessary medications or treatments. With her help and support i delivered a baby girl through normal delivery which was something I had never imagined. I would like to thank her from the bottom of my heart for her unwavering support and guidance. I would recommend ma'am anyday eyes closed.

We then started showing to her from 4 months of pregnancy, where she clarified that there was no such complications and that I am very normal and fit for normal delivery too. Throughout my pregnancy she was always positive and calm and gave me the right treatment and doesn\u2019t give unwanted medication or scans. Seeing her gives me soo much hope, courage and confidence that everything is perfectly alright. She listens to the patients very well and addresses the queries with such positivity that it relaxes the patient and makes them less worrisome. She had given me her number for emergency and whenever there was something she was very quick to respond over WhatsApp. I delivered my baby via normal vaginal birth and her entire delivery team is amazing. she and her team works so swiftly and efficiently that the entire delivery process was smooth.

Even at one point i was unsure that i will have normal delivery and made up my mind for c section , but i cannot ever forget , in the delivery room  she came , before that i was in so much pain..and quickly she took out the baby...i dont have much words, just thank you ma'am for making my pregnency journey easier , you never created any hype, we were always so relaxed after every consultation even though the report wasnt good.. You are amazing.",

We were referred to Dr. Kavitha Kovi by our previous Doctor. Right from our first consultation she has been extremely patient, calm and friendly, providing the right guidance. Although we were a bit worried after the anomaly scan as it suggested the baby to be quite tiny, Dr. Kavitha assured as that there was nothing to worry as I myself had small features and the baby would turn out to be fine. We strictly followed all her suggestions and medications, and in the end we welcomed our baby girl who weighed 2.32 kg at birth and now already 3 kg at 4 weeks. Dr. Kavitha encouraged me to try for normal delivery. I was induced at 38+6 weeks as it was an IVF Pregnancy, and waiting beyond that wasn't advisable. In the end we had to go for a C-Section as the cervix dilation wasn't sufficient. The surgery went on very smoothly even though I wasn't mentally prepared. Within two days I was able to walk around and was discharged the third day. All this happened only because of Dr. Kavitha's expertise. She was always available on whatsapp for any clarifications. She even asked us to forward her the reports on whatsapp, thus avoiding unnecessary visits to the hospital. She is not only an excellent Doctor but a very good human being. I have never seen her without a smile and I always was looking forward to meet her. I wish her the best in her career and personal life. ",

Your doctor plays a huge role in being able to assist you see that journey come to fruition. When I chose Dr Kavitha Kovi at Aster, Whitefield, I had no idea that I will be given this flexibility and the support that every mother deserves. Dr Kovi was not only supportive and patient throughout but also respected my wishes from day 1. My dream was to have an intimate, beautiful and natural birth with little or no medication, invasive measures etc and that\u2019s exactly what I got. I felt very relaxed as there was no unnecessary pricking or prodding, no cannulas! With the help of the hospital staff and my family, my delivery room was set up my way with fairy lights, no white lights, aroma therapy oils to help me feel relaxed, Hypnobirthing music and affirmations and a pool with warm water to soak myself in and my family for support. Although I had access to epidurals, TENS machine, laughing gas,  I didn\u2019t have to rely on any of this as my delivery was completely natural and happened within a span of four to five hours! I was given chest to chest as soon as my baby was born. Thank you to Dr Kovi for making my dream of a magical delivery come true \ud83d\udc95",

I had a cardiac problem soon after my first delivery which happened in home town. Though l recovered within a week, it was attributed as post partum cardiomyopathy and I was recommended not attempt any further pregnancy. But, I always wanted to have a second child and I felt very sorry for my health condition. After 4 years after the birth of my first baby, we met Dr. Kavitha for second opinion on the health condition and risk of future pregnancy. Based on the sequence of events how the cardiac problem was triggered, she assured that it could not be post portum cardiomyopathy and also suggested a review from cardiac specialist based on current condition. With minor unknown risk and all the confidence from Dr. Kavitha and the cardiologist, we proceeded for second pregnancy. At each stage of the pregnancy, she has given a special attention to my condition and addressed all questions and concerns very patiently. She has also arranged the review of cardiac specialist  after the second delivery and tracked closely during the recovery.  I and my family are very much thankful to all the great support Dr. Kavitha has provided to me during this journey and to have made my wish for second baby possible.",

She is like a mind reader even before you could ask she would always address all our concerns and questions. She explained the whole pregnancy cycle at the first meet itself and told me all the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts. She always made sure that I was at ease during consultations. She is very particular about guiding her patients to have a normal delivery. She kept telling me from the day one \u201clets have a normal delivery\u201d which gave me enough confidence and I was way too less stressed throughout my pregnancy. I delivered my 3.4 kg baby normally on 31st March 2023 and I am sure it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without doctor Kavitha. To be honest she could make a great therapist. She is amazing both personally and professionally. Me and my husband were so happy that we found the best doctor. We were planning to move to our hometown for my delivery but the only reason that held us back here in Banglore was Doctor Kavitha. I would totally recommend her to almost everyone I know.",

But after meeting mam she practically explained the possibilities and gave strength to start our journey. One thing we could say about mam is she is very efficient, practical,  straight forward and  has lot of patience to listen the patients problem  and answers all the doubts. We started our pregnancy journey with her and it was a tough pregnancy but because of Kavitha Mam it became a smooth ride. Now we are blessed with baby boy and thank you mam  for making this journey  easy going. One more interesting thing about kavitha mam is that whenever we meet Dr.Kavitha Mam she welcomes patients with warm smile which makes everyone very comfortable and will clear half of the problems right away.We are very greatful to you and thanks once again for helping us to make our dream come true We strongly recommend Dr Kavitha kovi Mam ** *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** ********** ",

However, we all would agree that the very first visit to a gyno leaves you in a state of confusion- doctor is exactly opposite to what we dreamt of , couples finding it difficult to put their priorities/ concern before the doc , you get an impression that you are just one of 100 deliveries doc will do this month, so no big deal.\nThese were our experiences when we embarked our 2nd pregnancy journey. Our experience during 1st child was really good - this made more difficult to choose a gyno.\nHowever our search ended on Dr. Kavitha when my sister\u2019s close friend suggested her name.\nShe knows her work, soft spoken, someone who listens to you, understands your priorities and most of all always available to reply to your queries over phone.\nThis visit was different for us. We understood that we can continue with Dr. Kavitha, you get that impression.\nI will recommend Dr Kavitha to everyone, you are in safe hands , doctor visit would not be a torture, one of the best experiences you will have.",

We started consulting her around the start of second trimester and the journey has been super smooth since.\n\nShe is one of the most easy to talk to gynaecologists I have met. Doctor Kavitha comes with an open mind and a tone of friendliness to hear your concerns out and provide help in the best possible way.\n\nI had past experience of anxiety and she was extremely understanding of the fact and even suggested continuing therapy unlike other doctors who discount the importance of mental health.\n\nShe was also supremely supportive throughout my tiresome labour and tried for vaginal delivery to the best that she could. We ended up going for a c section when she was a 100% sure vaginal delivery was not an option anymore.\n\nHer availability on phone calls and WhatsApp messages was a big help as well. She is not someone who will push you to visit the hospital for smaller issues that don\u2019t need her observation.\nHer practical approach to decision making related to having medicines/ using epidural/ going for a C-section etc. made the process much easier for me and my husband.\n\nHer words in our first visit will always stay with me, all the more now because she proved it right -\n\u201cYou take care of your health, I will take care of your pregnancy\u201d. :)\n\nA big thank you from our baby boy, my husband and I.\n",

A Dr becomes god if she is reachable by you always and ready to listen to you with answers to each and every question with high compassion. She gave us confidence which made us more comfortable. I still remember the night when I was crying with pain, I texted her in the night and she replied to me within 5 minutes with a call. I mean who calls back a patient in the night, I was surprised and happy at the same time. If I talk about the day of the delivery I informed her just before leaving my home and guess what she had reached the hospital before us. Thank you so much doctor for being with us during this journey, you acted like parents to us when we were very far from home.\nI also wanted to include here that unlike other doctors she always insisted me to normal delivery instead of a c-section. We followed each and every instruction given by her and yes we got absolutely normal delivery.\nMay god give you every happiness you deserve.I recommend Dr. Kavitha Kovi to everyone who is looking for a doctor cum buddy cum friend cum bestie and a lot more.",

While my wife was under her supervision at the \u201cRainbow Hospital\u201d, Dr Kavitha Kovi overlooked most of the reports and said the baby is fine and all vitals and anomaly reports shows a good healthy baby. On delivery from the same hospital (RAINBOW CHILDRENS HOSPITAL IN DODDNAKUNDI), the pediatricians came up with alarming news about the baby having congenital heart defects and other sever multiple organ issues. The pediatricians were asking where the scans and tests were down and why such a big negligence was done. When we countered all tests and scans were done at the hospital and verified by Dr Kavitha Kovi, they were speechless and tried ignoring further conversations and escalations. Further when my wife was shifted to the room, Dr Kavitha kovi visited her at the bedside and mentioned whatever pediatricians were all saying were wrong and there is nothing wrong with the baby. *** ** ****** **** ******** **** *** ********** *** ********* **** ***** ** *** *** ****** ****** Either ways its never the doctor or the hospital who needs to live with this difficulty of loss of life for the rest of the period, they will just move on to next patient with commercial interest!

My first eight month of pregnancy was spent with some other doc of a renowned hospital and having spent so much time we were still not convinced with the entire set up and the doc .Changing doc and hospital in the ninth month was a bit scary , however as mentioned earlier we wanted \u201cA Safe delivery \u201c and heard about Dr Kavita Kovi . In my first interaction with her i was convinced and decided to go ahead with her. \nI also had Cholestasis of pregnancy which led to early and planned delivery. All of this was handled very well by doctor and the best part was the comfort we got whenever we interacted with her. She always encourage me for normal delivery and with gods grade and doctors guidance, I had a safe and normal delivery and a healthy baby. The entire setup at Aster was very comforting, helpful nurses, lactation consultant and entire staff made it feel like home. Will highly recommend Dr Kavita and the hospital.",

(Personal experience, almost given up in the last hour, but she motivated and tried her best, finally it worked out very well.)\n- Especially, when the patient is getting admitted for delivery, the doctor leaves clear instructions with the labor room, and duty doctor and does the active follow-up too.

We feel a lot of care in her communication.\n2. Always listens to the patients and guide appropriately\n3. Sometimes, we were accompanied by kids & parents, even with them she vibes well.\n\nDr Kavitha kovi was the Doctor for our first baby delivery. After our first experience with the Doctor, we recommended her service to our neighbours & friends. They were also happy with the treatment.\n\nAfter 5 years, when we were considering a second baby, we searched her profile on the net & paper. Even though she was in a different hospital, we again consulted her for second delivery as well. \n\nBoth the deliveries were safe & normal. You can see the TRUST & FAITH, we had on the Doctor.\n\nToday, the healthcare industry plays an important role in our lives. We see many cases where the hospitals & Doctors misuse the patients' circumstances to their benefit!!  But, Dr Kavitha kovi is changing the wrong perception and giving us a good impression of Doctors.\n\nWe wish Dr Kavitha Kovi to continue her wholehearted service to many people like us and serve humanity at large.\n\nBest wishes\nSheetal, Gireesh \n& our two bundles of JOY",

In Whitefield, Dr Kavitha was one of the two most recommended doctors by my circle of friends. During consults, I found her friendly yet frank. She always preferred being cautious yet not overtly so. She anticipates your questions and concerns and answers them before you ask. She thoroughly briefs what to expect for next stage as well. For what looked like a moderately normal case of pregnancy, I wondered what made a doctor special. I would know that only on the day of my delivery when I saw how completely in control she was of the situation. As a person who loves SOPs I appreciate how her team of nurses have been trained under her to set everything up to her requirement in labour room. I was screaming in pain and was all over the place until she came. Note that she plans (and informs you) to join you only during final stage of labour where her expertise matters most. her crisp yet calm instructions moved my focus from pain to actual labour. Yes, I have no other experience of my own to compare it to and I didn\u2019t (touchwood) have any major complications but I felt her way of talking you through during the NVD is exactly what you would need at that moment. You know she is there if things go wrong but most importantly, she will make sure things go right. ",

I was fortunate to get associated with Dr Kavita Kovi from day 1. Her pleasant smile, warmth, focussed approach and advice with years of experience, always provided me with care which I was looking for. Her medical expertise and sincere advice mixed with personal/ family touch made me feel special. The nine months went by and I delivered a healthy baby girl by normal delivery. I or my husband can not express in words how smooth it went and she was always there, on her toes to make sure, we are at ease. She takes personal care and make the last journey as painless as it can be. I definitely feel, Dr Kavita Kovi is an angel sent by God, who is serving the humanity selflessly. Thanking Dr Kavita Kovi would not be an appropriate word but with all my heart, I wish her all success in life and thank you for being with me during my motherhood journey and making it very special.",

My case was a high risk pregnancy due to high BP and gestational diabetes and considering the age. I consulted 2-3 doctors before (through out 9) months. My doctor before dr. Kavita kovi, asked me to get admitted  pretty early in 37 week of my pregnancy for Csec. While we requested dr to wait for few more days, she scared us with all the possible complications. I am still scared to recall those complications. We terribly wanted to change out doctor and then someone suggested us to visit Dr Kavita Kovi in Aster. We visited her on the very same day. That day I got to know that I am ready for normal delivery and already 2 cm dilated. Her positivity and confidence brought my BP down quickly. She was very sure that VBAC can be done. \nEven when I admitted in the hospital, she was there until I delivered. She made the impossible thing possible. \nShe is a hope for all who wants normal delivery. She is truly amazing.",

I delivered my baby girl through normal deliver process. Dr. Kavitha is very supportive, she guided me very well through out 9 months. Kavitha mam was available on phone and whenever I had a doubt she was responded quickly. She is very encouraging and there is no single doubt about her expertise areas. Also hospital staff Mrinalini was very supportive and every time I needed some support she was always very quick to extend that. The hospital has all the advanced facilities. The Cleanliness is also great in the hospital. I must say that Dr Swathi, who was on duty when I got the labour pain did an amazing job by providing me emotional and physical support. She calmed me down by talking and letting me what labour stages I am entering. This helped a lot in making up my mind accordingly.",

Dr. Kavitha is a significant part of this hospital. She is very amicable and can do wonders. \nThe cost of bringing a new life to earth is also quite reasonable.

We visited her for our second pregnancy and wanted a VBAC (normal delivery, after our previous delivery was caesarean) - she explained how she has done many of these, what protocols she will follow, what all we have to do to ensure a high success rate. She does not believe in too many medicines or unnecessary treatments / tests or follow-ups - which is a rare quality in doctors these days in India. She was extremely patient with all our questions and helping us calm down even when we were anxious. The day of delivery experience was also fantastic and she & her team of doctors took excellent care of us and ultimately helped us with a successful VBAC with a healthy baby.",

I strongly say that with out Kavitha mam, it was not possible.\n\nWhen ever we require any assistance, Kavitha mam replies to the message .

My baby was in breech, so I had to go in for a C-section, which I was very nervous about, but Dr. Kavitha explained the whole process to me, made sure I knew exactly what was happening when and also my husband was able to be with me all the time during the C-Section. The surgery was done great, fast, without pain or fear and we were blessed with a beautiful and healthy baby. Thank you Dr. Kavitha! I also want to mention that my C-Section scar healed very fast and is almost not visible, which I really appreciate. ",

We started consulting from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy after bad experiences at another renowned hospital where we were unnecessarily made to undergo repeated scans. These scans and repeated consultations made us tensed every time we visited the doctor. And hence we decided to consult Dr. Kavita Kovi who made sure we sailed through the journey peacefully and delivered our bundle of joy. I would recommend Dr. Kavita to anyone looking for a blissful pregnancy journey. Thanks for the wonderful experience, doctor.  ",

That\u2019s when I felt I\u2019m in the safest hands despite my condition. The right guidance, constant support and positive attitude of this Dr is unexplainable, which made my pregnancy journey so simple. She is really an Angel sent by God.

Unfortunately I had miscarriage in just 2 months. This was a second time I had, in a year, with Kavitha Kovi. Top of that she suggest casually, that you can try next time, less bothered on one's physical and emotional loss.  Later when I checked with another doctor, she told that I was having \"Thyroid problem\" which was clear by the test taken that time. This is unpardonable. \nWe go to doctor because we need their help to understand such medical things. They should at least remember the things they are getting paid for.\n",

She just connects so personally with us that we never felt the pain of home away delivery. No unnecessary scans , medicines or false advices. She is also available 24hrs and all her assistant doctors are also helpful. I would say no need to think even twice about your delivery if you are in hand of Kavita Mam.",

But Dr Kavitha handled & guided us through the next 2 trimesters exceptionally well and safely delivered us with a baby on May 3rd 2021. We were worried due to 2nd wave of covid pandemic at its peak during may 1st week. But madam explained us all the options in front of us to handle emergencies just incase. Decision to consult Dr Kavitha is one of the best things that we have made in the recent times.",

She is a very good doctor and very caring in nature. She talks to the point in case of any problem with pregnancy and always has shown us the right way for the required treatment. Her diagnosis is superb and I have a blind trust in her decision making. For us, both the pregnancies were risky but with her advice we sailed through them comfortably. We started consulting her when she was in Columbia Asia Whitefield hospital and then followed her wherever she joined later. Beside, being a very good doctor, she is a very fine human being too. She helped us a lot to manage both the pregnancies without having any presence of any other relatives or our parents. Such situations can be very challenging during delivery and post delivery, but her guidance helped me a lot to manage both mother and child singlehandedly during and post birth of both the children. \n",

Both of them advised removal of uterus by open method as the size is big. I came to know about her through my  apartment fellow residents. When i approached her,  she confidentially  said she will do the entire procedure laparoscopically. She performed it completely laparoscopically using morcellator. I was discharged in 48 hrs   with out any complications. I got back to my work with in a week. The hospital is so good , the rooms are very big and comfortable . The nursing  staff are very well trained and the doctor is so friendly. I strongly  recommend her. overall it is  a wonderful experience.\n",

Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd70.\nI am a foreigner who living in Bangalore in past 7 years and I have visited many doctors here regarding different concerns but my experiences were not good and I was not satisfied at all. And when I got pregnant, I really worried how can I find the trusted doctor. Then I found Dr Kavita in procto, I have read many stories of her patients and decided to book appointment vs her. From the first time we met her she gave us very positive energies, truths and confidence. She made my pregnancy journey became easier. \ud83d\ude09 My overall experience with her are she is very positive, understanding and listening to patient\u2019s concerns and explain the situation in good way, empathy, she doesn\u2019t give unnecessary medication/scan. And I asked her that I wanted normal delivery, she said \u201cof course you will\u201d, 3 weeks ago we got our beautiful daughter in normal way with the help of Dr and her team. I am Very grateful, now I am sharing this experience to all while my daughter is sleeping.  I will surely recommend my friends to her, in fact I already did recommend to few of my close friends. Wish you the best. @Dr.Kavita Kovi. \ud83d\ude0d",

This being our first pregnancy, there were numerous instances wherein my husband and I had so many worries and so many questions in mind. But, Dr. Kavitha was always there to ease our anxiety and give us a positive boost. Every time we met the doctor, we would return with renewed hopes and positivity that everything will be fine in the end. She was like a motherly figure who would always pick me up and never let me give up. The Doctor always motivated me to have a normal vaginal delivery and I would say that it was the best decision ever. Today I am the proud mama of a beautiful daughter and I have nothing but all the respect and praise in my heart for Dr. Kavitha for making this happen. I wouldn\u2019t imagine going through my pregnancy with any other doctor under the sun.",

She is such a wonderful person cleared all my queries and gave confidence to me.\nOne of the point that attracted me a lot is she always suggests/recommends normal delivery until and unless critical issues or running into issues during labor, infact samething happend to me as well when we were in Labor room by seeing pains my husband got scared and asking doctor to proceed with C-section but doctor gave confidence to him and gave normal birth to my little princess.\n\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to entire Aster hospital team A big thanks to Dr. Kavitha kovi mam (Admission- Vishnu Priya/Cicilia, Duty doctors Labor - Shivani, Sonali Jha, Pediatricians, Nutritionst, Physiotherapist, Duty doctors, entire nursing department, House keeping - maragatam.",

It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!I had swelling on my hand during pregnancy for which she has taken extra care and resolved the problem by going out of her duty , she consulted orto surgeon immediately and saved me from unnecessary x ray scan. I made some tantrum after delivery due to the pain  but she handled it very well with her complete team. And talking about the hospitalMy experience has been awesome. The services have been very nice, everyone from the housekeeping to the nursing staff has been very kind and helpful. Kavita kovia team  doctors are amazing and give a lot of confidence and have a very positive attitude, even if there were any ups and downs team would handle the situation so well and would never let us panic. Dr kavita kovi and her team...dr.sindhu and dr ...I forgot.name - looks for.ansthesia is an amazing doctor and even 5 minutes with her can make you feel so much at ease and she gives support at every step . We feel really grateful that we chose to deliver at aster hospital. Highly recommended",

I moved out of india post marriage and i returned back in 2015, did some online research and decided to meet her. I had irregular periods. Only during the first session she seemed to be polite, she assured that things will improve. The next session, i remember so well that she was on personal call for 1 hr, she was discussing to someone about her experience at some Taj hotel and some issue she had with another doctor, and i was simply sitting in the room with her waiting for her to end the call. I was waiting politely and after the call, i suppose she was in bad mood, she started yelling at me, she said i was 28 and i was aging and then i cried. i still continued to visit her as she prescribed medicines for regularizing my periods. She responds to your queries and scan reports by mail, which was good. i visited from May- Dec 2015. The last i saw her was at Columbia Asia, after she moved there. In Jan or feb 2016, only 6 to 7 months of consultation, she said try Hormone tablets or she asked me to check with infertility specialist that she prescribed. That was the end, the moment she said hormone tablet i stopped going to her, ** **** ****** ***** ******* ******* ******* ** *********** *********** **** *** ****** ************* I consulted another doc in May 2016, i conceived the very next month with no hormone tablet or treatments, i jus conceived normally.  No i wont recommend her to anyone.",

Mam helped us in getting a normal delivery for which we are thankful tons of times to mam as now a days in Bangalore people can do minimum 3 c sections in an hour but still mam insists us to try for normal delivery which will take at least 5 hours for a patient and we are one of them who are very lucky to be in mam\u2019s hands. Tons and tons of thanks to mam and very strongly recommend mam for delivery related .",

She kept me comfortable throughout my pregnancy, explained each and every process clearly and patiently in detail in every visit. She clearly instructed what I should watch out for and what I shouldn\u2019t worry about. Always reachable over phone/whatsapp and responds immediately. She doesn\u2019t recommend frequent hospital visits and recommends tests that are absolute necessary. It is because of her experience and great care I had a smooth pregnancy and normal delivery. Highly recommend her.",

Being very approachable, she was always at a calling/messaging distance and responded to all my queries patiently without getting me panic stricken. Definitely recommend her to all ladies. Thankyou Doc!",

The doctor does not recommends any needless medicine or tests and pushes for a normal delivery , at the same time the doctor gives tough love where needed, when I was putting on weight during the pregnancy the doctor clearly called out that if we wanted a normal pregnancy I should control my weight. It really motivated me. Thanks a lot to Dr. Kavita we had a great experience during the pregnancy and labor. Will whole heartfelt recommend her .",

And we were lucky to have found her as she got our baby delivered naturally, without compromising both baby and mother' health :) \nShe's very friendly yet strict when needed which is needed for someone like me who's too scared of this whole pregnancy concept :)\nShe goes through our medical history thoroughly and based on that she starts treating us.\nBest thing is She's available on watsapp which most of the doctors do not encourage :)\nAlso, she dresses up really well ! \ud83d\ude00\n",
