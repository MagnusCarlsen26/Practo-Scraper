I visited Dr.Padmapriya gynaecologist, I told her my issue and she was so pleasantly and patiently listening to mine and gave me few remedies of how I could improve on it.
What happened next was a miracle for me, after a month visit of mine, I tested positive with PREGNANCY üòÅ, this was such a bliss to me and my family. After all of that I went back to Dr. Padmapriya for my future regular consultations, it was all because of her that made my pregnancy in ease, she was always motivating, being very positive which is really important for any women to be during pregnancy.
The next thing was that I wanted her to be there and do my delivery, trust me it was worth and I had a successful delivery.
