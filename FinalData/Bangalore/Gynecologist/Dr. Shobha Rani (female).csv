None,"Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"I took my wife for Gynae related, suspected for a pregnancy. We have been advised to take scans every week or twice in the 'Manipal hospital, old airport road' to wait for baby's heart beat. But finally after a month they have found it as molar pregnancy. They could have found this in the initial first 2 weeks, but they prolonged us for nearly 5 scans(1 month). 
When we gets these reports to another hospital for second opinion, they had told molar pregnancy is seen in the initial scan report but 'why manipal hospital doctor is unable to recognize this'. 
Now due to this delay, my wife's mole turned into tumour and still she undergoes a cancer treament.
If the doctor or radiology person identified this initially, she wouldnt have suffered this bad stage. They would have done D&C initially which wouldnt have allowed this tissue to grow.
I cannot blame the doctor directly, she only verifies the scan report. I would completely blame the radiology person who took the scan and also the carelessness of the doctor reviewed this report",2016-08-11 11:41:03,False,False,Rajsudhir Neelakesi,,,
