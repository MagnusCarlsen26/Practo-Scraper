I wondered whatever happened in this situation but blessed to have great doctors like Dr. Shilpa and Dr. Haresh, My wife has spotted bleeding at 14 weeks, by the time we have reached hospital water breaks, after ultrasound, Dr Shilpa said that the baby is fine though water was not completely drained; it was very critical situation for us. Immediately they have started treatment to hold water leakage, infection. She was under observation for 16 days, in course of water break, placenta was also started separating, every scan was a big hurdle for us, It was challenging for Dr Shilpa too. My wife was put on complete bed rest from then, lost amniotic fluid can’t be reproduced overnight, but their expertise in the field of gynecology, suggested medication along with diet plan helped us in early recovery, moving on our daily scans turned into weekly and monthly scans, She explains every part of treatment which gives confidence to the patient and hope to the family, they have dedicated staff, they have monitored hourly round the clock. They are very helpful and provide good ambiance to the patients. Hospital has well equipped and maintained with good lab. Your half pain will go when you talk to Dr Shilpa and Dr haresh Babu. Hospitals staff extended their support to our home. During 33.4 weeks my wife got pain in her abdomen, and they have done C section, we are blessed with a baby girl at 33.4 weeks. Since it was pre-term baby, she was in Rainbow NICU for 4 days and then moved to Grandhim Hospital after Dr Haresh babu assurance, since then Dr Haresh babu took personal care, and we are continuing our regular vaccination at RajaShri Grandhim Hospital. Now our baby is 3+ months old. Believe in God, never lose your confidence and have faith in your doctors.
