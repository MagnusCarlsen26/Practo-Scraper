We are Kishore and Chaithra (Parents of baby boy)
I would like to share just one scenario that might give you a small Hint regarding the experience of Dr. Regina's
We had been for the last consultation(1 week before delivery) and Ma’m had informed us that normal delivery would be little difficult and Chaithra’s body is not favorable for one.
As Ma’m advised we got admitted on the next day to induce pain. Until 4:30 Chaithra did not feel any labour pain and hence Doc moved her OT and delivered a baby boy through C-section. After delivery when Ma’m explained the difficulty that she faced to complete the surgery due to the baby had rounded the chord twice around its neck.(This was never captured in any of the scannings) 
Doc literally had to push so hard (Normally delivering women would do :) :) ) and that could be next to impossible for a normal delivery to happen.
I’m really Thankful to Dr. Regina for taking the right decision at the right time.
After delivery she had come out calmly and said due to God’s grace we could do it. I actually strongly feel it’s due to Dr. Regina’s grace everything was normal.
There are lot of technicalities involved in this process and Trust me Dr. Regina is an amazing technician :) 
Just blindly follow what ever Ma’m says and she will take care of everything which I believe she will take the correct decisions.
This was my case but there are other two cases where Ma’m delivered a normal delivery. 1st one was the person who referred us to Dr. Regina and 2nd one(my sister) was whom I referred Dr. Regina to.

I would like to Thank Dr. Regina once again !!!

Explained about the disease and treatment required and side effects and post operation treatment. I was very scared and anxious. She comforted me and conducted the surgery which was a very complicated one. It was stage 4 endometriosis with bowel adhesion. Another important thing is that I could approach her for any doubts on the treatment over the phone through text or a phone call.
