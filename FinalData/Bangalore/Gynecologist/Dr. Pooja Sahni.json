She definitely knows her patients! She ensured to answer all of my whats/whys/hows, this was my first pregnancy. She definitely made the journey so simple & fun. On the day of delivery, I still thought I cannot do it when the pain was shooting up, felt i dont have that strength in me but Dr.Pooja and her team kept on saying \"You are progessing well, You are doing well!! this was kinda moral support honestly! Just that you know  I was in labor for 10 hours. For me, Dr.Pooja is literally GOD for bringing a life in our lives! I was lucky that she was My Doctor!",

I started suffering from anxiety issues and had to go to therapist and my therapist gave reference of Dr. Pooja Sahni. I am very happy that I consulted Pooja mam. It came to know that I have fibroid and when I was worried abt it, mam explained me what it is and her communication always gave me relaxation. \n     I am sharing this review with pleasure and regards for Dr. Pooja Sahni",

I never could have imagined of delivering normally, but throughout my pregnancy Dr.Pooja believed in me and put a faith that I can have a normal delivery. *** ****** ***** **** *** **** **** **** ** ***** I have been scared of injection always, & believe me she kept it at minimal, limited medicines & injections, crucial ones only! She definitely knows her patients! She ensured to answer all of my whats/whys/hows, this was my first pregnancy. She definitely made the journey so simple & fun. On the day of delivery, I still thought I cannot do it when the pain was shooting up, felt i dont have that strength in me but Dr.Pooja and her team kept on saying \"You are progessing well, You are doing well!! this was kinda moral support honestly! Just that you know  I was in labor for 10 hours. For me, Dr.Pooja is literally GOD for bringing a life in our lives! I was lucky that she was My Doctor!",

I started suffering from anxiety issues and had to go to therapist and my therapist gave reference of Dr. Pooja Sahni. I am very happy that I consulted Pooja mam. It came to know that I have fibroid and when I was worried abt it, mam explained me what it is and her communication always gave me relaxation. \n     I am sharing this review with pleasure and regards for Dr. Pooja Sahni",

We never had any bad experiences until she left Cloudnine hospital to join another.\nBecause other hospitals were far from our home, we decided to continue at cloudnine but with another doctor. This is when we realised, not all doctors choose this profession to help others. Most of them become doctors to earn money. One fine morning after 3 months of pregnancy and previous painful miss carriage, my wife noticed blood and that\u2019s when we called our new doctor just to ask if we need to come to hospital. Her first response was, how dare you call me this early in the morning, take an appointment and visit me in the hospital. It was 9.00 AM and it was an emergency because we didn\u2019t knew what was to be done.\nThen we decided to call Dr. Pooja and she was there for our rescue. That realisation hit us hard and we decided to change our hospital for good, even when Dr. Pooja\u2019s hospital was far, we decided to consult with her.\nToday, we have a healthy baby and thanks to her. May god bless her.",

Especially when it\u2019s your first time giving birth there are 1 million questions And concerns that you have. She was approachable throughout my nine months of pregnancy and even went the extra mile of being available over a call when I needed quick advice. During my delivery she helped counsel us on the best approach and during my surgery, was extremely supportive. I highly recommend Dr.Pooja to all new mothers and anyone who has not had a supportive doctor during their pregnancy. Thank you for a wonderful experience!",

She is always reachable and very knowledgeable, have contacted her in odd times but still she used to be very patient and replied to my queries. This is one doctor whom I can trust blindly. Even now if I have any questions she is always answered it patiently. I really thank Dr Pooja for the treatment she has provided. Thank you Doctor.",

I was gaining weight too much which was not good for my delivery but maam helped me and planned my diet so that i couldn't gain over weight and be healthy. Whatever happened to me it would be day Or night no matter any problem I used to watsapp her and instantly she used to reply and help me and also if it was emergency she used be there. By seeing my weight there was less chance of normal delivery and more chance for c-section but because of pooja maam and her staff I delivered normal delivery. \nI thank pooja maam and altius hospital for all care and support",

She is patient and understands your issues (even if she's heard them all several times before!) before deciding the course of action ahead. \nI'm glad i met her and decided to go with her for a procedure i was really worried about. But she made it really easy and I'm back to being almost fully functional, in just about 2 days, which to me is something I'm grateful for. \nThank you Dr. Poojan Sahni.",

When I had severe complications during my pregnancy she was there for me everytime I needed her support & guidance. \nThere is a saying that \"Medicines cure diseases but only Doctors can cure patients\".\nYes that's absolutely Right Doctor Pooja was a Disguise in God in my life who not only treated & cured me but also guided supported me as a Family & helped me in every possible way when I was alone in this phase of life. I owe my life to Doctor Pooja for being there as a mentor caretaker throughout my whole pregnancy phase. I just Pray that Almighty should Bless Doctor Pooja for all her good deeds & efforts & May The Lord give her Strength to cure every patient in her career phase.
