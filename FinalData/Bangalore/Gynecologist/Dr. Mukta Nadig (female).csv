My wife (Harshini) was apprehensive,excited, nervous, scared, jittery and tensed;  she was basically in unknown territory! 

Appointment taken and we were waiting! Those few minutes felt like forever!! Dr.Mukta welcomed us into the room and she spoke to us just like a friend. She comforted us and asked us the routine questions; she advised us to go for a pregnancy test. The following weekend, my wife and I were supposed to fly to Bali, Indonesia. When we inquired with Dr.Mukta, she firmly advised us against the trip as trips can always be postponed, however, the bundle of joy arriving soon and it's happiness cannot be expressed in words! How right she was!

All through our scans, multiple pregnancy check up visits , she guided us along the correct path. There were stages where there were reasons to get tensed and scared, however, she assured us and calmed us. She gave us strict advice to avoid outside food(as much as possible) and eliminate any source that can cause problem to the  baby. We adhered to the 'T' and I guess that's what was the best for the baby and mommy!

She encouraged mommy to be as active as possible - regular walks, Pre-Natal Yoga (Squats are great) - to target a Normal Delivery. This pushed mommy(and Daddy) for regular walks! Dr Mukta also encouraged mommy (and Daddy) to actively take Lamaze classes (which tremendously helped during Mommy's active labor) . All these are indications to Dr Mukta's sustained efforts for mommy's normal delivery!

Come the 'D' day where the bundle of joy wanted to come out and Dr. Mukta was right there to help mommy with the delivery! As Harshini was wheeled into the Labor ward, I wasn't allowed in( COVID restrictions). The next 45 minutes, I can be best described as a Train Wreck. I could hear Harshini pushing and pushing, and there comes our Dr Mukta - She was calm, assured and armed with the million+ deliveries'(feels like it!) experience, she brought out the angel to this world. She was also available in the Inpatient room for us as part of her rounds that she does!

Anyways, the experience was brilliant and I found Dr Mukta to be the perfect blend of professionalism and conservatism.

Took into consideration all my wants and specifics regarding delivery. Aptly anticipated needs - for me and my guest in the tummy, and timely addressed all.

Conservist coz she actually forbade me to travel even during my 'safe' 5th to 7th months of pregnancy due to risk of infections (at crowded places), while most other doctors do allow all sorts of travel during these months. But had to agree with her on logic - to better play it safe than regret. And some of her advice sounded similar to that of elders at home - eg: eating less cashews during pregnancy, etc.

She confirmed that I was 6 weeks pregnant. She is a very friendly person, equally professional, she talks to the point, gives her patient enough confidence and supports them throughout.I had a miscarriage before and told her about it, she gave me complete confidence  saying that this baby is her responsibility. She never suggests unnecessary tests or scans until it is really necessary. At times others might feel that she is rushing, but she makes sure she has complete track of her patients.She always encouraged me for normal delivery. I waited almost till my due date but no signs of labor hence she took a call to induce labor and asked me to get admitted. One entire day she induced pain, but there was no signs of it. Doctor at the same time waited patiently for one whole day keeping  complete track of my progress thru her staffs though she was not around which gave me more confidence that I was at best and safe hands! She din't panic me at any stage, continued to support me for normal delivery. After one entire day, I delivered a cute and healthy baby girl.I still believe, if it was not Dr. Mukta I would have ended up with C section.Completely happy with her.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,YES,"I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl in march, I had a normal delivery which in my case was a little difficult and all the credit goes to Dr.Mukta. It was a precious pregnancy as I had a history of recurrent miscarriages and was NK cell deficient. I was in a really bad need of a good gynecologist, who would understand my problem. I came across Dr.Mukta from all these great reviews about her on practo. When I first visited her she read all my reports with patience and reassured me that this time everything's going to be fine. I started consulting her and things went on really smooth. (I was put on LMWH injections and ecosprin.) In every appointment doctor would go through even the smallest detail in my reports and would take timely, precise decisions. She never prescribes unnecessary tests or medications. Her treatment is always on point. I would definitely recommend her to everyone. 
In my third trimester I was low on Hemoglobin,so doctor suggested me a Iron injection which is given through IV. I was really scared to get that injection and I still remember  she went to the nurse personally and advised her to be gentle with me as i was scared. She also came twice to check on me. who does that? I mean which doctor takes so much care of a patient. This act of her really touched my heart. Lucky me...! 
Also Due to my past history of miscarriages I used to overthink a lot and would ask so many questions but doctor was always ready to answer even my silliest question. She always welcomed me with a smile and throughout my pregnancy she boosted me with confidence. During my labour she came to hospital at midnight in no time for which I am really greatful to her. I can actually go on and on and would still not stop praising her. She's one of a kind. Thank you so much Dr.Mukta. You actually have no idea how much of joy and happiness you have bought into our lives. You are truly a gem‚ò∫Ô∏è ",2022-05-01 21:20:55,False,True,Verified Patient,"Thanks for the effusive praise!!

"Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS),",0,0,YES,"Went to Dr.Mukta when I was 6 weeks pregnant and she confirmed that there was a heart beat. From then started regular visits. She is always cautious and makes sure she follows up on any thing that might even be slightly out of ordinary. Talking to her, you get the feeling that you are in good hands. 

For me one of the things that reassured me at every visit was that she used to check the fetal  development using the scan machine. With this we had the confidence that things are going smooth without having to wait for the major scans. 

She encouraged us for normal delivery, though we were open to all suggestions. When my due date was approaching but the baby didn't drop and I had no signs of going into labour any time soon, she suggested induction. I wasnt 100% sure as I didn't know my pain tolerance and if I would be able to do it. However she gave me the confidence that we can definitely give it a try and if things don't progress as expected, then we can always evaluate our options at that point. That helped me really relax and  not feel guilty (I was caught between wanting a natural delivery yet not sure if I can go through the ordeal). 
As my baby didn't move down and the NST wasn't great after my water broke, she suggested C-section which went very smooth even though it was unplanned. 

She doesn't try to mollycoddle us and is quite transparent in her communication. She kept telling me to walk a lot and exercise regularly. She encouraged me to go to office as long as I was feeling good. However she would ask me to be careful, especially towards the end and not take risk as my office and hospital were quite far from one another.

Overall, I would definitely want to go to the same doctor next time.
