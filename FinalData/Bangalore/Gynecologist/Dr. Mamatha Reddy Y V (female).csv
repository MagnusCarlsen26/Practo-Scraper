None,"Health Checkup (General),",0,0,YES,"I had nothing but exceptional care and skill from Dr. Mamta throughout my treatment. Dr. Mamta was very supportive and attentive. While I will not provide my own medical details, there were certainly moments that I required not only a highly capable , but also real support. I always felt like she was my advocate, and knew that she was thinking about her patients all the time. In addition to her real care and compassion, she's thinker who is up to date on the latest research and guidelines in the field. That's something important to me. She is an amazing doctor, and I feel lucky to have her as mine.

I like her nature. She is warm, friendly, personable, kind, and sometimes just outright funny. She has the BEST bedside manner, doesn't hold judgement over anything you may say or do, and will provide her medical opinion, but still respect YOUR wishes in spite of her own opinion.

Dr. Mamta is quick and efficient. The checkups  are very quick, make sure nothing is wrong, make sure everything looks good, and then she asks if I have questions.  you will know some DON'T even ask if you have questions. And with some, even if you do, they hurry you out the door. Not so with Dr. Mamta. She will sit and answer all your questions if you have them  and she will not make you feel rushed.  I asked all my questions, After headed out the door, and then realized last minute I had forgotten to ask my question a I poked my head in at her office and asked her if I could ask my questions, and she was very accommodating. 'Sure, have a seat, no problem'.

I think if this was something you wanted from Dr. Mamta  she'd be happy to hold your hand and tell you. BUT I think you'd have to let her know that's what you wanted. I mean, she says 'do you have any questions for me, open your mouth and say Yes.

However the negative part in the clinic is the waiting time. I have visited the clinic for follow up appointments for five times. among these five times three times I have been forced to wait at the clinic for a minimum of 4 hours. This waiting happens just because the staff in the clinic or the clinical management do not follow the first come first serve process. Patients are sent inside for consultation randomly.
