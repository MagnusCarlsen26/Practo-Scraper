,"Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"She is a senior doctor, of course, knows things better than her naive patients. We paid 800 to be able to talk to a doctor. Hardly 3 mins is what she had for us. 
She was rushing, had a queue outside, sure. She wasn't interested at all.
She has a junior doctor, that's who you get to speak for 5 mins before meeting her. You are actually paying so much to meet that junior doctor because the senior doctor doesn't have time for you. *** *** ******** **** ********** ** ** *** **** **** ********* ** ***** *** ** *** *** ****** *** ***.

She explained every situation in detail. I had viginal infection during last days of my delivery she was so supportive and caring she used to cross check everytime with me if I was ok .
