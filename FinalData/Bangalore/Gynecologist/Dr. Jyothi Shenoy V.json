Mine was high risk pregnancy with endometriosis so I had got all extra care and support from the Doctor all the time. Our monthly scans were smooth and everythin went well for 7 months. My water level was high and was put on rest in 7 month, I was also informed by Doctor if going innearly labour anytym after 33 weeks. We went for my scan and everythin looked fine and came home the next day I got pain and was rushed to hospital in the early mrg 4. In 10 mins Dr Jyothi was there to see me . This is her dedication and the most important thing was one of her hand was fractured, she didn't give up on her patients even then.. as I mentioned it was high risk pregnancy and I wasn't due still .. It was my week 34 and Doctor Jyothi tried everything to support me and controlling my pain levels i was given steroids for withstanding pregnancy but my body gave up andmy bp was shooting up and sodium level imbalance and endo cyst broke inside complications were increasing .. the whole day I was under observation trying to postpone the delivery but once Doctor saw my reports she came running to me in the midnight with her fractured hand and informed us that I needed to deliver at the earliest. It was 11 pm in the night.. whole night Doctor was with me monitoring my CTG and repeated scans to check baby s health .. she slept on a strecher that night outside the OT I don't know which doctor would do this for her patients..  her level of dedication is somethin i havent seen anywre..  early morning I was taken for emergency c sec and I delivered healthy twins babies . She was there through each sec of my battle in this. \n\nStrongly recommend Dr Jyothi. ",

Same was encouraged by the doctor too. On the delivery day my water broke too soon early in the morning. Still the doc was ready to wait till late evening for normal delivery and assured me that she'll be there throughout. She remained positive even when baby had pooped inside and wanted to wait still. But baby had other plans and got very agitated inside, her heart rate dropped to half and the pains grew unbearable. She was called immediately and within 10min the entire team was there to do the C-section. My baby girl was safely delivered and I was encouraged to breastfeed right away. I would recommend Dr. Jyothi to everyone.",

Mine was high risk pregnancy with endometriosis so I had got all extra care and support from the Doctor all the time. Our monthly scans were smooth and everythin went well for 7 months. My water level was high and was put on rest in 7 month, I was also informed by Doctor if going innearly labour anytym after 33 weeks. We went for my scan and everythin looked fine and came home the next day I got pain and was rushed to hospital in the early mrg 4. In 10 mins Dr Jyothi was there to see me . This is her dedication and the most important thing was one of her hand was fractured, she didn't give up on her patients even then.. as I mentioned it was high risk pregnancy and I wasn't due still .. It was my week 34 and Doctor Jyothi tried everything to support me and controlling my pain levels i was given steroids for withstanding pregnancy but my body gave up andmy bp was shooting up and sodium level imbalance and endo cyst broke inside complications were increasing .. the whole day I was under observation trying to postpone the delivery but once Doctor saw my reports she came running to me in the midnight with her fractured hand and informed us that I needed to deliver at the earliest. It was 11 pm in the night.. whole night Doctor was with me monitoring my CTG and repeated scans to check baby s health .. she slept on a strecher that night outside the OT I don't know which doctor would do this for her patients..  her level of dedication is somethin i havent seen anywre..  early morning I was taken for emergency c sec and I delivered healthy twins babies . She was there through each sec of my battle in this. \n\nStrongly recommend Dr Jyothi. ",

Same was encouraged by the doctor too. On the delivery day my water broke too soon early in the morning. Still the doc was ready to wait till late evening for normal delivery and assured me that she'll be there throughout. She remained positive even when baby had pooped inside and wanted to wait still. But baby had other plans and got very agitated inside, her heart rate dropped to half and the pains grew unbearable. She was called immediately and within 10min the entire team was there to do the C-section. My baby girl was safely delivered and I was encouraged to breastfeed right away. I would recommend Dr. Jyothi to everyone.",
