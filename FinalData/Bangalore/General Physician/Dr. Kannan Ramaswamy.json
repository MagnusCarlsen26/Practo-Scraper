First question what he asked if the child was special child or normal child, this was a very bad question to ask any parent.

He made a remark \"I don't have time to collect details of the kid from birth and the family doctor should summarise about the diagnosis and give him a copy\". If the doctor has no time, then he shouldn't be looking at the patients. Doctor is a very senior person and we never expected this type of behaviour from and experience doctor.   He also attended a phone call while he was speaking to us, this was also not professional. ****** *** ** **** ** *** ****** ******* ** ** ******* **** *** ** ***** ** *** ******* **** ** *** ** ******* ********* **** **** ** ** *** *** **** ********** ** *** ******",

He made a remark \"I don't have time to collect details of the kid from birth and the family doctor should summarise about the diagnosis and give him a copy\". If the doctor has no time, then he shouldn't be looking at the patients. Doctor is a very senior person and we never expected this type of behaviour from and experience doctor.
