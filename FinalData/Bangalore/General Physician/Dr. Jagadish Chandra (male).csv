"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Blood Pressure Changes,Body Ache,Gallbladder Issues,Thyroid Disorders,",0,0,YES,"Have you seen any doctor returning your money? Well, that is what exactly happens to me.  My father-in-law, who is from Kullu visited Bangalore and had a gallbladder stone treatment. Treatment happened under careful observations of Dr. JagaDish, Dr. Munni Reddy, and Dr. Vijay Kumar.  My Father-in-Law was very happy with the treatment and consultations he got from Dr. Jagadish. 
Father-In-Law went back to Kullu but he is still under treatment for his thyroid from Dr. Jagadish. He does his test and scan in Kullu and we take consultations in Bangalore from Dr. Jagadish. So last time when I visited him for my father-in-law's consulation he returned the consultation fee and asked me to come directly into the office from next time onwards.
