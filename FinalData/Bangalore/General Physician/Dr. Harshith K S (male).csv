"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cardiac Disease,",0,0,YES,I consulted Dr. Harshith at Apollo hospital Jaynagar as my husband had slight chest pain. The doctor suggested ECG and a blood test to find the cause of pain. He Was very patient and explained us the readings and test reports to assure us things were fine and it was just muscle pain and nothing related to heart. We were satisfied with our consultation and would definitely recommend him. ,2018-06-23 09:48:22,False,True,Chaitra,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Cardiac Disease,",0,0,YES,"I used to consult the doctor for my diabetes and on one occasion I had breathlessness. On explaining the symptoms doctor advised a TMT test in May 2018. The graph revealed cardiac problems after which angio was done, followed by bypass surgery. Dr. Harshith's quick diagnosis helped me to prevent a heart attack. I have now fully recovered from surgery. I would defintely recommend Dr. Harshith. He was able to bring down my glucose levels under control in just a couple of weeks. *** ***** ********* ** *** ****** ********* *********** ** *** ****** ** **** ****** *** ******* ********* ",2018-09-19 09:22:58,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
