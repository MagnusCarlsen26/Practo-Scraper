None,None,0,0,YES,"My 2yr old kid fell down, wounded his forehead and was bleeding through a deep cut. We were worried on how and where to take him in this pandemic situation and citywide lockdown. Dr.Deevish advised us to visit him immediately and checked out my kid. He treated him patiently and applied sutures in his clinic. Doctor was very helpful and shared detailed information during follow up visits as well, regarding scar reduction. My kid is recovering well and wound is also healing without any significant scar.
