A few weeks ago, I was running a very high temperature. We had consulted two doctors before visiting Dr Raja and they had asked us to wait for 3 days for the temp to come down as it was most likely viral fever in their opinion. But after 3 days, the temperature was still running very high (103-104). When we visited Dr Raja at his clinic, he listened to us patiently and quickly conducted a few tests. Since I had no other symptoms, the doctor studied the case thoroughly and even consulted his peers to make an accurate prognosis.  He was very clear with his approach and explained to us the possible causes and treatment in detail. 

Finally, it turned out to be a rare case of typhoid which had caused severe liver inflammation. But by the time the typhoid results were in, I was already on the medication for it!

I was hospitalized in his clinic for 4 days and the staff (esp. Ms Jennifer & Ms Zainab) took very good care of me. We are very grateful to the doctor and the staff for all the help provided during that period.
