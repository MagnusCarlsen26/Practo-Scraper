None,"Fever,Colds,",0,0,NO,"We have been suffering from cough and cold as a Family.i thought it would be helpful to take a few minutes to explain my condition. He thought these details where unnecessary and told me to move on. The whole discussion was one directional with him reccomending medicines and was not ready to hear my symptoms.  He also gave me some life lessons on how to sneeze , not to talk when when he was taking my pressure. He interruoted me many times when i was speaking and also showed his discomfort multiple times when i  speaking. I was so disappointed by the whole experiments, I decided go walk out. I am not planning to come back nor would I recommend him.",2017-10-07 14:05:46,False,False,Srikanth Babu,,,
"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"We showed doctor the report of thyroid tests which he repeatedly claimed is not trustworthy as we took a package from thyrocare. He told us to take vitamin D sachet for 1 month and then check for thyroid again. on which I told him that we are already taking the D-Rise from past 5 weeks and this test were done yesterday. On this, he said then take a test after 2 months. I am confused this is what he would have told us if we might have come to him after 1 month.

Another thing which he said that if the thyroid levels are higher then 10 then immediately medication has to be started and in our report, it was 19. He didn't start any medicine for that which doesn't look satisfactory. Sorry but not happy with the experience.",2018-10-17 17:41:13,False,False,Neeraj Kumar,,,
