,"Wellness checkup,",0,0,NO,I am sorry to say but doctors come always late. You will have to wait for a long time. The doctors attendant is not at all attentive and people keep waiting. The doctor doesnâ€™t update with next patientid on display board. For Blood pressure issue of my father took 5 visits to get the right medicine.. I have to pay the fees every time which is quite high. I am disappointed.,2020-03-15 00:16:50,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
