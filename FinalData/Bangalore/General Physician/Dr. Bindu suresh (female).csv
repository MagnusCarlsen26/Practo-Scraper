1. She listens very patiently to all you have to say, never interrupts, makes you comfortable as you describe the situation
2. Her approach of minimalistic medication is amazing. She will never prescribe more than you need. Just to put in perspective she once said ""You had this problem, it is now gone, what we see is the residue, I do not want to treat you unnecessarily""

"Wait time,","Preventive Medicine,",0,0,NO,"I waited for more than 30 minutes, and the doctor still didn't show up. We are also working professionals and have to plan out the day around such events. Doctors can't take timings for granted and leisurely walk in whenever they want. If there is a delay expected, you need to inform the patients so that we can plan our schedules better as well. 
Also, the clinic is in such a bad location. There is no parking, there is a board saying 'parking for doctors only'. I had to drop my wife off and had to continuously roam around in the car due to the non-existence of parking. Such information should be communicated on the listing.

None,"Urine Infection,",0,0,NO,"I visited the doctor Bindu for my wife urine infection. I would say I have never seen such  senseless type of treatment. 

There is a basic sense that when you are treating infection, you need to have a followup with the patient and have the retest done to see if everything is fine , but she is so much confident on her medicine that everything will be fixed by her medicine and we don't need to revisit.
But the problem persisted and we visited again to her but again she showed us the same reckless behavior. This  time the infection has increased by 5 times , but she follows the same approach.
