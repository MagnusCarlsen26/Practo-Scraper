"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Physcian,managing acute medical conditions, Pneumonia,Body Ache,Fever Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I have had the pleasure of receiving medical care for my family from Dr. Pankaj Singhai at Manipal Hospital, Old Airport Road, for the last ~10 years. 

My mother is a RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patient. She has been taking treatment for RA at Manipal Hospital, Old Airport Road, Bangalore, since 2008.

When her health deteriorated, with multiple problems in 2014, my father approached Dr. Pankaj Singhai in 2014. Considering her chronic condition, he had prescribed a low dosage and administered commensurate treatment and gradually brought her to a normal level and set her health right, and saved her life. Since then she is under the treatment of Dr. Pankaj Singhai and he has been treating her with an appropriate dosage. On account of his treatment, my mother is active today. 

The holy proverb “Doctor is next to God” appropriately applies to him. 

I and my father have advised our relatives, friends, and associated colleagues to approach Dr. Pankaj Singhai for better treatment. 

I and our family are indebted to the doctor for the exemplary medical care he has given to my mother.",2023-04-05 07:50:22,False,True,Vijayatha G,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Gastric troubles,Fever Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I’ve been consulting Dr. Pankaj since 7 years now and trust me I’ve never looked back to any other GP since then. Whenever I’ve a condition where I’m unwell mostly due to fever and gastric or any other ailment then I run to him and trust me when I walk out from chamber I’m calm, cool and composed. It’s just not about his accurate analysis and medication, it is also about the confidence he puts in my head to make sure I’m getting the right treatment. Also he tells a lot about managing small episodes of gastric and fever at home by taking right medicines and not to run hospital each and every time which is highly recommended. A charming and friendly person who doesn’t recommend unnecessary tests and medicines but a lot of trust to make sure you’ll be treated right . Took a long time to finally write a valid review but longer the better . I highly recommend him and make sure your appointments are booked well in advance to avoid longer waiting period at Manipal .",2020-11-03 13:10:25,False,True,Sourabh Bhardwaj,,,
