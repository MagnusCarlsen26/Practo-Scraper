My mother is a RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patient. She has been taking treatment for RA at Manipal Hospital, Old Airport Road, Bangalore, since 2008.

When her health deteriorated, with multiple problems in 2014, my father approached Dr. Pankaj Singhai in 2014. Considering her chronic condition, he had prescribed a low dosage and administered commensurate treatment and gradually brought her to a normal level and set her health right, and saved her life. Since then she is under the treatment of Dr. Pankaj Singhai and he has been treating her with an appropriate dosage. On account of his treatment, my mother is active today. 

The holy proverb “Doctor is next to God” appropriately applies to him. 

I and my father have advised our relatives, friends, and associated colleagues to approach Dr. Pankaj Singhai for better treatment. 

I and our family are indebted to the doctor for the exemplary medical care he has given to my mother.",2023-04-05 07:50:22,False,True,Vijayatha G,,,
