He's a wonderful human being. Gives his patients all the attention that they need. Once, he even arrived at the hospital to attend to my father in the middle of night. He stayed with us until we were certain that my father was OK. Not sure how many doctors show this kind of care to their patients, and commitment to their profession. Thank you Dr. Ramachandra.",

He's a wonderful human being. Gives his patients all the attention that they need. Once, he even arrived at the hospital to attend to my father in the middle of night. He stayed with us until we were certain that my father was OK. Not sure how many doctors show this kind of care to their patients, and commitment to their profession. Thank you Dr. Ramachandra.",
