"Treatment satisfaction,","Well Woman Healthcheck,",0,0,NO,"Bad experience.
I have consulted her on Monday 11th Oct 2021 through Practo. It was a  video consultation from Gurgaon. She suggested me some test . After watching my test reports she prescribe me 2 medicines out of one is not available in any pharmacy.I have watsaap her that one medicine is not available ,after no reply I called her in her personal no but she didn’t pick my call or not even bother to reply me back. it’s almost 3days I am waiting for her reply for medicine replacement.
I don’t know what kind of doctor is she who don’t even bother to reply her patient.
I will never ever recommend to any one to consult her bcoz only one time she is available after that if anything happen to you she will not respond.",2021-10-15 19:10:22,True,False,Verified Patient,,,
