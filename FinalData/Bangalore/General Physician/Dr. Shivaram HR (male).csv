Fever, cold, chills and body ache are external manifestations of several underlying diseases. All these signs and symptoms are commonly seen in Dengue, Malaria and typhoid. A blood test is the most confirmative investigation to detect the underlying cause. As such the blood investigations advised to you were necessary to rule out these serious infections.
In my tenure as a Medical Consultant with the World Health Organization, I have observed that Dengue, Malaria and typhoid are an endemic in India. There is an alarming rise of dengue cases in Bangalore with one third of the Karnataka’s dengue cases being reported from our city.  India accounts for 75% of all the Malaria cases in South East Asia. Sadly most of the deaths occurring due to these diseases can be attributed to late diagnosis and its complications. 
As such a fever should never be taken lightly, an early detection and early treatment intervention saves you from further complications. As the old saying goes “A stitch in time saves Nine”.
Of 642 suspects with fever and body pain i send for dengue in last 1 year-157 cases turned positive.
