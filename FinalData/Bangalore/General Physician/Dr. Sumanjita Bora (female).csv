First of all I am happy to hear about your mother‚Äôs recovery. Great that you took her to neurologist as per my advice and her condition had been addressed appropriately. 
As per your concerns towards multivitamin and calcium , actually for elderly people these will add benefits rather than doing any harm . So your mother can continue those . Regarding return of medicines to pharmacy, I am not the concerned person, and individual pharmacy has individual policies. So I couldn‚Äôt help on that . 
 As a responsible physician and clinical cardiologist my first responsibility towards patient is to Diagnose the disease , treat the disease if it‚Äôs in my domain , If disease is not falling in my domain then to refer to the appropriate department. In this case I am happy that I had directed her to appropriate department and got treated properly. 
 Hope you understand the visibility and limitations of a medical professional. Doctor doesn‚Äôt mean everything one single doctor can do . That's why there are different departments and different specialisations , super specialisations are available in medicine.
