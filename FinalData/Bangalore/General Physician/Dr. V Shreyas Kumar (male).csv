"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Throat infection,",0,0,NO,Doctor is very rude *** **** ********** Doesn't make the patient comfortable is speking or sharing his or her problem. As a doctor if he feels that taking any first aid medicine without  consulting a doctor even at emergency situation is wrong then there is definitely a way of expressing his concern or advice to a patient in a polite way. Instead from the very second we entered he was speaking sarcastically. Was very surprised to see a doctor speaking so rude and sarcastically to a patient. overall was not happy with this doctor visit.,2019-07-03 16:51:53,False,False,Mathan,,,
