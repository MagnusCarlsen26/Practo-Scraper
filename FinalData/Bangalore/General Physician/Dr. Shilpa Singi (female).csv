"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I and my wife have been consulting with Dr Shilpa for last one year. * **** ***** **** *** ** **** *******
She gives enough time to each patient in not only understanding problem and symptoms but also to understand ""The Patient"", his/her psychology, concerns.This goes a long way in establishing a Doctor- Patient bond. Also she does not believe in prescribing unnecessary and lots of medicines, tests etc. Believes in a very targeted minimalist medicines approach which avoids all side effects.
My wife has been suffering from stomach problems for over 20 years. We consulted dozens of very senior Gastro specialists in Delhi and Bangalore without any success. But Dr Shilpa was able to diagnose problem (after almost an hour long talk with my wife) and prescribed only one medicine which has worked so well like a miracle.
Thanks a lot Dr Shilpa. May we get many more doctors like you. ",2017-01-15 05:50:43,False,True,H.K Agrawal,,,

I met her when I was diagnosed with Diabetes and was really tensed because of getting diagnosed in my early 30s. Dr. Shilpa instantly made me comfortable and had a great empathy. She gives enough time to patients and develops a great bond. After 3 months of treatment and significant improvement in my health be it my noticeable weight loss as a result of diet and workout suggested by her or be it my diabetes being in control, I want to heartily thank Dr. Shilpa for her treatment, help and instilling confidence in me.

It is not technically correct to write multiple medicines irrelevant in a clinical scenario. 
The focus has to be 
for a priority problem that in your case is fever and cold cough 
There is one more follow up “free” when you can again come and discuss your issues !!
Medically  the problem at hand has to be taken care and it should not be mixed with many months long and year long issues it makes the treatment process and understanding easier for the patient !",2023-02-23T13:42:58+0000,Dr. Shilpa Singi

",2016-10-23 07:53:36,False,False,Pankaj Singh,"Mr Pankaj your problem were two 
1.type 2 diabetes and 
2. plantar fascitis 
and you wanted to know whether the two are connected 
medically speaking they are not connected and the blood tests were done to assess your diabetic status and confirm that the feet pain was not because of other problems like raised uric acid .
Prescribing pain killers over a longer period can lead to complications like renal damage as the problem of fascitis is a long term problem and can last for many months to years .
The other alternate treatment like physiotherapy and ortho advise was suggested to you .",2017-02-15T05:30:15+0000,Dr. Shilpa Singi
