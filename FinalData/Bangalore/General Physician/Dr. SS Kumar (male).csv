None,None,0,0,YES,"The Dr. S S Kumar was extremely patient in hearing out my observations and give his diagnosis after a detailed examination.
He did not suggest any unnecessary tests (which I was in fact expecting him to suggest). Of course only time will tell if that is indeed the best approach.
Nice calm environment (for waiting), but the space is limited, so plan accordingly.
Also note that despite booking an appointment, you might have to wait a while (which I guess is expected anywhere).
Overall a good experience.
