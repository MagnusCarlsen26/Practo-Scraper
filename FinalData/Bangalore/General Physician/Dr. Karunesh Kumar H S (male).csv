"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,","Diabetes Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my story and here we go…

I was 36 years old and weighed 98 kg when I received my diabetes diagnosis in 2014, and that is when my adventure as a diabetic patient began.

Doctor (first doctor) says it's too early for me to get diabetes because of my age. He told me it might be cured if I follow all of his medicines and instructions. I put a lot of efforts (exercise) and at least two years of punctual medication taking into my life. Naturally, medicines are changed—not regularly, but most of the time. After two years, I didn't receive the anticipated outcome. I decided to change doctor, but the situation remained the same, and this is the fourth doctor in eight years.

Sometime around May-2023, I experienced extreme physical pain and my blood sugar unexpectedly spiked above 300. My friend suggested that I see a NEW doctor. Although I was not prepared to see another doctor but I didn’t have a choice.

First visit for 15 mins, NEW doctor asked me to get some reports done (in his lab) and come back after 3 days with all reports. I went to lab, gave the samples that were required (blood, urine, etc.), and was charged more than 6k. I really got angry as I have to pay 6k + consultation fees in the first visit???? but again because of my friend I kept quiet.

Two days after receiving the reports, I went back to the doctor. And this time, it was incredible! He looked over all of my reports and gave me a detailed explanation. The conversation went on for more than 45 minutes.

Additionally, he promised to help me heal in six months as long as I do two things a day.
1. Morning walk (fast) at least 3 – 5 km
2. Regular tablets (1 after breakfast & 1 after dinner) 1000 mg

And this is what I did from day 1
- 1st week fast walk 3 kms
- 2nd week fast walk 5 kms
- 3rd week onwards fast walk 10 kms
Result after 1 month, I lost 3 kg and sugar level below 200

Continue 10 km morning walk (fast) in 2nd month – lost 2 more kg and tablet has come down to 500 mg.

Its 5th month now, I go for walk every day (10 km) and as of today only one tablet of 10 mg after breakfast and that’s it.

Now a days (last from 1 month) my sugar level is minimum 70 and max 150 and currently my weight is 88 kg.

I am Happy 😊
