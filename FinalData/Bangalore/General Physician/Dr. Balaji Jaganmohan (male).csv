"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Diabetes Management,",0,0,YES,"Thank you so much Dr. Balaji Jaganmohan Sir and Friendly staff and very kind in taking care of Patients.

I had the privilege of being under the care of Dr. Balaji Jaganmohan, an exceptional diabetic doctor, and it is with great pleasure that I share my experience. Bring down my HBA1c levels from 11.2 to 6.2 which is really incredible.

One aspect that truly impressed me was Dr. Balaji Jaganmohan's commitment to a holistic approach to diabetes management. They not only addressed my medical needs but also emphasized the importance of lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise.

Their comprehensive guidance helped me make significant positive changes in my daily routine, leading to improved blood glucose control and overall well-being.

If you're searching for a diabetic doctor who combines expertise, compassion, and a holistic approach to care, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Balaji Jaganmohan. They are a beacon of hope for anyone seeking comprehensive and personalized diabetes management. With them by your side, you'll undoubtedly be on the path to better health and a brighter future.",2023-08-01 08:27:30,False,True,Veeresh Math,,,

"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Diabetic Neuropathy,Type 1 Diabetes,",0,0,NO,"Firstly waiting time more than 2 hours from appointment slot. Secondly, I request Doctor to see patient and understand the issues and then advise whether to continue same medicines / go for blood tests Not just ask Nurse to advise and ask to do all the tests and come. 
Without even seeing patient and writing all blood tests in small slip and take 750rs consultation. And asking if need to enter in file, another 100 rs extra. which is very pathetic and totally unfair.
