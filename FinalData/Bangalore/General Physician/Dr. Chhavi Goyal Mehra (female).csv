"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Type 2 Diabetes Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Under Dr. Chavvi's guidance, I was able to reduce my HbA1c levels significantly. Her detailed instructions on medication, dietary adjustments, and exercise routines were clear and easy to follow. Regular monitoring and adjustments to my treatment plan ensured continuous progress. My HbA1c dropped from 9.6 to 6.4 demonstrating the effectiveness of her approach.

I’m very impressed with the service at the Sugar.fit diabetes clinic in HSR Layout. The health counsellors, Misba, and operations manager Akhilesh, have been incredibly supportive and professional, offering excellent guidance and care. The clinic is always clean and well-maintained, thanks to the dedicated housekeeping staff. Their attention to hygiene adds to the positive experience at the center. Thank you to the entire team for your exceptional service!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Diabetes Management,",0,0,YES,"I recently finished Sugarfit's diabetes reversal programme, guided by Dr. Chavvi Mehra, and the results have been nothing short of life-changing. When I started the programme, my HbA1c values were shockingly high at 8.5%. After following the personalized plan by the Doctor, health coach and the dedicated team, my HbA1c values have reduced to an outstanding 5.7%. This huge improvement has improved both my health and my entire quality of life.
