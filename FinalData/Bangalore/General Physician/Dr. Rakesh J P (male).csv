A very young and enthusiastic doctor that to being a physician is available very nearby on the main road of Nagarabhavi.
Very rarely we can find a doctor like this because after hearing/diagnosing the problems and sufferings of the patient, he won't proceed to prescribe the medicine (as most of the doctors normally does).
Instead he starts explaining the root cause of the disease with sketches/ diagrams to the patient and his attendants so that they understand better.  This act/method of explaining (dedicating his valuable time to each patient) of this doctor is very much appreciable.
