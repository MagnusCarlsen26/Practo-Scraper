None,None,0,0,YES,"The Dr is excellent ,kind,explains to patients the type of sickness you have .

But the staff is pathetic,
Do not know to pronounce names of the patient.
Opd worse,no proper attender to take care of the patient if the strecher is required,
Or if they have to help to put the patient on the bed.

I think there should be a proper P.R.
In the hospital to handle patients ,with there issues.
