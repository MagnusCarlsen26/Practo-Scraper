When I took the reports, the doctor was already left. I was redirected to visit after one week. I neither visit again nor took those medications. The reason was that, I am not a nonsmoker but I smoke occasionally. I have mentioned it when he asked. But in prescription, it was mentioned that I smoke on a regular basis.
