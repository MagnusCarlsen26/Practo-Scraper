My brother in law was treated by him and his group at Columbia Asia on covid related issues.  He literally gave him a new life. I'm a pharmacist in the USA and have been in close contact on how he was being  treated at Sagar hospitals where he was not only  treated horrible but also had to experience life threatening conditions as a result of the treatment he recieved at Sagar (Sagar hospital hasn't followed any basic protocols related to his covid treatment)
Dr. Magesh Balakrishnan (Cardiologist) is my brother in laws life saver who insisted on joining him at Columbia Asia and after which my brother in law was truly saved by all their efforts.  He guided us throughout and we are so grateful for all his efforts and guidance!
My family can't thank them enough and forever indebted to these great doctors! 
The treatment was to the point and very efficient.  Thank you  the whole columbia asia doctors!

"Treatment satisfaction,","Outpatient treatment,",0,0,NO,"  I visited Dr Sunil for pain in my right arm and explained the background (not sure if he really listened to that).  He gave me 2 medicines as follows:
Tab WYSOLONE 30mg 1-0-0 x 5 days (After food)
Tab ULTRACET 1-01

I clearly told him my B.P. was measured 161/96 during vitals checkups at the Hospital prior to Docotor visit and I generally have high B.P.  130/92-95.

He said, we will see B.P.  problem later and let's now focus on your arm pain.

After starting WYSOLONE (30mg dose prescribed by Dr. Sunil) ,  second of dose I felt some swellling on my face, 3rd day it was even more swelled and I was feeling headrounds so went to see another general physician at different hospital, and my B.P.  was measured 113/167.
