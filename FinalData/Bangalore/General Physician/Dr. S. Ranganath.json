For one, the crowd in his clinic didn't prompt him to do a cursory job. His thoroughness and experience came through everytime. He would prescribe just one or two medicines and in the 33 years I have had just 3 or 4 tests prescribed.\nYes you have to wait but you would enjoy the details if you were the patient ,right?\nAnd all the specialist he connected me to are still my  doctors- ortho, eye,dermatology,  *** ******* ** ********",
