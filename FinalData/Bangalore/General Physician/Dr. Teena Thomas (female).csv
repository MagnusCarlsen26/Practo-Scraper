"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Teena has been our rainbow after our difficult experience with another doctor for our previous pregnancy that led to an medical termination. 

From the first visit, Dr. Teena was super positive and kept it very real. She gives you information that you need and nothing more. She is patient to answer all your questions and also a good counsellor for when you have apprehensions and worries. One big help was her availability over messages for times when I had some challenges during pregnancy and also post delivery. 

Personally the fact that my age (37) didnt bother her and she never mentioned it or questioned me about why I/we waited so long before getting pregnant etc was very comforting. She also instilled confidence in me, by not scaring me with the usual 'Oh this is a G3 pregnancy, there could be complications.. etc etc..'  

My delivery was also normal, she didnt push for a Ceserean delivery, allowed me to go through 14 horus of labour and yet when I almost gave up, she stood by me and encouraged me to go through with the process and thanks to her, I delivered a normal healthy baby girl, who is amlost 2 months old today. 

We will be eternally grateful to Dr. Teena for her support and guidance through my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery journey. God bless you Doctor!",2024-05-16 06:40:50,False,True,user,,,

We visited Teena Ma'am for our first born, we visited ma'am based on recommendation, and it turned out to be the best recommendation.

What we liked about ma'am************************************************
1. She is very polite, calm, and always smiling
2. She listened to all our doubts, anwered all our questions, even
the silly ones with same smiling face, as always
3. Throughout the pregnancy period, there was not a single
instance when we felt that ma'am is in hurry to see another
patient, and hence giving us less time, it never happened. It
was always us who said, we are done with questions :)
4. Very supportive, very understanding, ma'am ensured we feel
like home when talking to her
5. She prescribes very less and only needed medicines
6. Her focus/priority is normal delivery, and not cesarean.
Although in our case, my wife couldn't have a normal delivery,
but that has nothing to do with the doctor.
7. Ma'am gave good enough time to my wife during the delivery
8. She did a regular visit to see how my wife was progressing
after the delivery.

NOTE: Throughout the pregnancy, we just followed what mam said, without a doubt.

In my and my wife's understanding, ***** ***** ** ******** *** ** *** **** **** ********* ** ****** *** ** ****** ** ******* *** * **** ***** **** she is the one who should be consulted without a doubt.

I might sound bit emotional but trust me when my wife had heavy bleeding at 14th week of her pregnancy; we were taken a back. It was subchorionic hematoma of considerable size(>50%). Dr. Teena handled the situation very sensitively and accurate to the point where her expert diagnosis of the condition helped us sail till very end of this journey. The journey after 14th weeks was tough due to multiple other complications but Dr. Teena oversaw every bit of it closely and very carefully. It’s easier to get depressed with this kind of situation at hand but with Dr. Teena you are in for a treat. The way she handled the situation with her expert medical advice and guided us, we never felt stressed because Dr. Teena brings in a sound medical advice with a composed persona. I’ve never met a doctor who is not only the expert at her field but goes all-in for a patient’s care. At times, we called her at 3 AM in the morning and she wouldn’t think twice before picking up the call and guided us.

Dr. Teena has enormous attention to detail, medical accuracy and excellent interpersonal communication. As a patient what more one would expect? I’ve always had a peculiar complaint off doctors in India that they don’t spend enough time with patients; Dr. Teena proved me utterly wrong. She is not only a compassionate doctor but an expert in her field. She knows what she is doing and does it with ease. I was amazed to see her knowledge and philosophy of practising evidence based medicine which was not only effective but was boon in case of my wife’s complicated pregnancy since we could not have afforded to go wrong at any stage. Dr. Teena explains you the possible diagnoses in detail and doesn’t rush into a decision without your comfort; she is simply amazing at dealing with patients in the most humane way.

It wouldn’t be an overstatement that doctors are God for patients; Dr. Teena is indeed one for us. If it was not for her then we couldn’t have made to where we are today.  Thanks to her that we are blessed with beautiful twins. Thanks Dr. Teena for everything you have done and gave us such beautiful and everlasting joy and memories to cherish for our lives!

The hospital nursing department is doing an exceptional job. The patience and attention they show is truly appreciable. Our baby was admitted in NICU for almost a week due to low birth weight. It was the toughest time for us. The care and kindness the NICU nurses showed actually boosted our hope and made us believe that our baby is in the right hands.
