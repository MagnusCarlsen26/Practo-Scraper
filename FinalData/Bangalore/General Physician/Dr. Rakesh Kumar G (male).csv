None,None,0,0,NO,"I visited for a medical fitness certificate for a trek from this doctor, I had done an annual health checkup in Jan end 2024 and they want me to do their own expensive annual health checkup once again in May 2024. Seems like a scheme to me. An annual checkup is done one a year and here they don’t consider it despite it being perfect record. The doctor didn’t even bother to check the details about my reports my age and instead told the receptionist Archana, I need to get that check up done again.

This is a very bad experience from the hospital. Never visiting again.",2024-05-23 10:11:15,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,Dr.Rakesh is down to earth personality who understands his patients very well. His follow up is worth mentioning when a patient revisits. Doctor is a good listener and gives ample opportunity for the patient to explain his health condition. Rakesh is such a doctor who believes that less medication or only the required dose that will help the patient. He encourages his patients to also participate in healing his own issues by practicing home remedies.  The doctor gives appropriate medical guidance. I recommend Dr. Rakesh based on his expertise and experience  in his field. ,2024-01-03 11:34:54,False,True,Muralidhar Rao,,,
