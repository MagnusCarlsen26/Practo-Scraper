The Doctor was not welcoming at all. First question what he asked if the child was special child or normal child, this was a very bad question to ask any parent.

If the doctor has no time, then he shouldn't be looking at the patients. Doctor is a very senior person and we never expected this type of behaviour from and experience doctor.
