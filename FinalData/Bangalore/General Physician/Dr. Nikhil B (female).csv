None,"Stroke Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Dr. Nikhil B attended to me when I was admitted to the hospital for stroke. He also consults at Cleveland Neurocare at Bilkehalli.

Honestly, he's one of the nicest people you can come across. He's a blessing in disguise as he gives enough time and energy to listen and attend to each patient before diagnosing issues and recommending a course of treatment. 

Today, he spent a good 45 minutes with us, to hear me out and inform me of every aspect of my neurological issues. My husband and I are really grateful to him for putting us at ease. We need doctors like these for complex neurological issues. I highly recommend Dr. Nikhil.B if you wish to be attended to properly.",2022-04-12 14:58:29,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
