To my surprise when i checked my Blood sugar ( Accu check ) after a week as per doctors advice, before fasting and the reading was 76 ! I couldn't believe it and once again checked my sugar level through my  other Johnson Glucometer and it was also showing 78. my self and my family is so happy and also my insulin is reduced from present 80 to 24 units. I am sure with in no time i will be out of this painful insulin. We are grateful to this wonderful human being for suggesting us the right path ahead... Thank you Doctor and God Bless.  ",

Despite being disciplined with yoga, diet, medication and doctor's consultation, my blood glucose level was high for about 18 - 20 months and I finally met Dr. Balaji Jaganmohan through social networking in August 2016. He heard my intolerance to certain medication, advised me on the significance of a diet regimen, put me on new medication and 1 month review has shown that blood sugar and blood pressure have come down, so has my weight and BMI. It left me with tears of gratitude in my eyes today when I met him on 27.09.16. I am trying to spread the word around to my circles so that everyone benefits with better health quotient. I am capable of working with him as a team. I wish others too, to get better under his guidance. May his tribe increase.\ncheers\nMalini    ",
