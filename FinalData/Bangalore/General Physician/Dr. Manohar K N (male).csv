On another note, avoid visiting him on weekend. Its badly packed. His schedule is extremely tight and you might not get a good outcome. He wont see things properly and will be usually in hurry to clear patients as thr is usually an extremely long queue & absolutely no walk-ins allowed.

None,None,0,0,NO,"************ He prescribed an antibiotic Cefpodoxime not in the list of sensitive drugs in culture report, knowing that it's a critical case of post operation UTI and infection can spread to the site of surgery quickly if not treated early. Even on asking how he arrived at the drug, he says it's better than Cefatoxime marked sensitive on the report. It is never a game of better among things not even tested on the report. 

Turns out both are third generation cephalosporins, and it doesn't make sense to prescribe one not tested sensitive in the report. Another two third generation cephalosporins were tested resistant in the report, Ceftadizime and Ceftriaxone. It was risky to prescribe an untested antibiotic.
