"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","managing acute medical conditions,",0,0,YES,"If kindness is a virtue Dr.Manohar KN has plenty of it. I was admitted into Manipal Hospital under exceptional conditions with a rather challenging medical situation. The medical case was complex because to start with I was immue suppressed, then had a false covid positive report, which was immediately followed with back to back negative reports however with low WBC and platelets. It took a few days for the WBC to come up. I am thankful to Dr. Manohar for the various matters, some of them being; 
1.	My family doctor who is a senior Endocrinologist coordinated with Dr.Manohar for my treatment, he was kind enough and obliged to keep him in the loop seamlessly. 
2.	Dr.Manohar often had my lab results at the tip of his fingers and compared the numbers with ease. 
3.	With his PPE and with seven days of continuous stint with covid patients, he was kind and gave me a patient hearing and also discussed the immediate next plans. 
4.	I am an experienced patient and with that I say, he handled my matter with utmost authority on the subject and with care. 
I am highly grateful to him to have supported my case in this very difficult covid situation.

"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Resistant Hypertension,",0,0,NO,I couldn't expect such a response from such a reputed doctor. I visited today with my mother to this doctor for a High BP problem which she has been facing since long. This person was quite busy with his stuffs and not bother of listening carefully as what i am telling to him. At the end he could not even give me a reason as why this might be happening and instead he said he would try a medicine to see if that works. And then finally he prescribed a medicine. He wrote a medicine and even didn't mention the power of the medicine. Now what power medicine am I supposed to buy? So should i go 40 kms (as i do not have his contact details) and ask him to mention the power or he should have mentioned it at that time itself? **** ***** *** **** ** *** ********* **** ****** *** ***** ** * **** ******* *** *** **** ** ** ******* **** ** *** ******** *** *** **** **** I paid and visited with some hope not to get such responses. Will surely never recommend to anyone.,2020-02-10 16:56:39,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
