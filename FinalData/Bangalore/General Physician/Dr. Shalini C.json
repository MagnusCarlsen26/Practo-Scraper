They took the time to break down complex medical jargon into terms I could easily understand.  They were thorough in their approach and made sure to involve me in the decision-making process every step of the way.  Their expertise and dedication to patient care were evident throughout the entire process, making every penny spent well worth it. I was pleasantly surprised by the minimal wait time  and I was seen promptly at my scheduled time.  just wanted to highlight that my A1c was 9 and it has come down to 6. i strongly suggest to those who have diabetes ",

The staff at the clinic were always welcoming and supportive, making each visit pleasant and stress-free. The clinic itself is well-equipped and maintains a high standard of cleanliness and professionalism.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Shalini and her clinic for anyone seeking effective diabetes management and reversal.",

They took the time to listen to all my concerns and addressed them with empathy and understanding.  explanations were clear and concise. They took the time to break down complex medical jargon into terms I could easily understand.  They were thorough in their approach and made sure to involve me in the decision-making process every step of the way.  Their expertise and dedication to patient care were evident throughout the entire process, making every penny spent well worth it. I was pleasantly surprised by the minimal wait time  and I was seen promptly at my scheduled time.  just wanted to highlight that my A1c was 9 and it has come down to 6. i strongly suggest to those who have diabetes ",

She is always available on phone/whatsapp and responds to messages. She took extra step and helped me in admitting to hospital when my oxygen level dropped. She is saviour of our lives.Thank you doctor for all your support and care when needed. At last we found a good caring family doctor in Bangalore. I strongly recommend Dr. Shalini for any health issues. I referred doctor to my neighbour and got the same positive feedback from them also.",
