"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Diabetes complications,",0,0,NO,"Dear Manipal Hospital,

I am writing to provide feedback regarding my recent appointment with Dr. Somnath Mitra on 2 feb, 2023. While I appreciate the opportunity to receive medical care at your facility, I felt compelled to share my concerns about the professionalism and demeanor of Dr. Somnath during my visit.

During the appointment, Dr. Somnath displayed several behaviors that I found concerning. For example, when I attempted to ask questions about my father condition, Dr. Mitra seemed dismissive and rushed, providing minimal explanations and failing to address my concerns adequately. Additionally, there were instances where Dr.Mitra tone came across as condescending, which made me feel uncomfortable and unheard as a patient.
As a result of Dr. Somnath, I left the appointment feeling frustrated and unsure about my treatment plan. This experience has eroded my trust in dr ability to provide compassionate and competent care. Although I have been referred to him by Dr Palankar. Even though I thought of admitting my patient under Dr. Somnath but by seeing his behaviour I can't go forward to get treatment of my father ***** **** ************** *******",2024-02-02 11:22:55,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
