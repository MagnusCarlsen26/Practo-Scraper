Despite having arrived on time, the doctor's assistant sends in another patient (with a later appointment) because \"he looked around and couldn't see me.\" It's 7:15 by the time I finally get to see the doctor, who asks me to get some tests and come back on Wednesday evening. I arrive on Wednesday evening, wait for half an hour, having driven quite a bit in the rain, through traffic, when I finally decide to call his assistant, who tells me the doctor is on leave for the next two days. What sort of appointment management is this? This clinic is not even a real clinic, just a room rented out by a very crowded diagnostic centre. Pathetic experience from start to finish. The doctor is polite but what's the point of politeness if you don't respect your patients' time? I just decided to see another doctor.",

Despite having arrived on time, the doctor's assistant sends in another patient (with a later appointment) because \"he looked around and couldn't see me.\" It's 7:15 by the time I finally get to see the doctor, who asks me to get some tests and come back on Wednesday evening. I arrive on Wednesday evening, wait for half an hour, having driven quite a bit in the rain, through traffic, when I finally decide to call his assistant, who tells me the doctor is on leave for the next two days. What sort of appointment management is this? This clinic is not even a real clinic, just a room rented out by a very crowded diagnostic centre. Pathetic experience from start to finish. The doctor is polite but what's the point of politeness if you don't respect your patients' time? I just decided to see another doctor.",

Hota assistant Rajkumar is extremely unhelpful, he doesn't inform the doctor of appointments in advance. When i spoke to the doctor, he said that he had not idea that he had a 5:50 appointment. Extremely ill managed. Won't recommend if you don't have a minimum of 4 hours for a consultation.",
