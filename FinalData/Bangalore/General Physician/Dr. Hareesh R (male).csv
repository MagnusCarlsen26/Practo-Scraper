None,"Fissure,",0,0,YES,"Consulted this doc for the first time and I am touched with the way he diagnosed my issue.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Fever Treatment,",0,0,NO,I went to Dr. Hareesh whom I have always trusted for treatment of fever (possibly viral). I recommend that Dr. Hareesh sticks to his own expertise and does not judge and lecture patients on their psychiatric/mental health. He was very insensitive and didn't listen to my issue of low grade fever for a week and lectured me without any reason for my elitism in taking covid tests suggesting vegetable vendors don't go around taking tests. I am dealing with mental health issues and multiple long covid health effects and the doctor was not willing to listen to my issue of fever and problem that I had come for. He had the impertinence to trigger off a panic attack through his rude questions. ******* *** ****** ***** ** **** **** ** ********* ** *** *** *** * ************ *** *** ***** **** *** ** **** **** ******** *** *** ****** ******** ************** **** ** ***** ** ******** ** ****** ** **** ** ***** ** ********* ** ****** ****** ***** *** **** ** **** ***** *** I came to you for helping me understand the cause for my fever and cold and treatment for it. NOT some uncalled for lecture on why I have taken covid tests in the past and questioning my faith in God and my mental health. So far I trusted you. Now I cannot.,2022-10-15 16:42:44,False,False,Maya,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,Had a very harrowing experience at Trust In hospital under Dr. Hareesh. under his in charge my father was admitted for a 24 hour observation which got extended ************* for another day as they delayed the test without information to the family. ************ *** ******* **** *** **** *** ** **** ** ******** ** ******* he arrived more than an hour later for opd consultation without any information of delay to his staff members and ********* denied  to see my father because my brother called his number after an hour of waiting. *** ****** *** ****** ** ***** *** ******* ** *** ********* ** ** **** he demanded respect just because he by profession is a doctor. His overall conversation has a lot of sarcastic comments even while treatment. I do not recommed him at all. ,2024-02-21 10:29:00,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
