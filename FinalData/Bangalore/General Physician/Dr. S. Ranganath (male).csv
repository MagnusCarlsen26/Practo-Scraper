None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr S Ranganath has been my physician since 1988. He practised in a time when ten medicines and umpteen tests were the norm and yet he chose to be different. For one, the crowd in his clinic didn't prompt him to do a cursory job. His thoroughness and experience came through everytime. He would prescribe just one or two medicines and in the 33 years I have had just 3 or 4 tests prescribed.
