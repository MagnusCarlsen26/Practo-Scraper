All of a sudden it struck me that I can meet an ENT once before leaving. It was a Saturday evening so none of the ENTs nearby were available. Luckily Dr Rakhee at Amar Jyoti nursing home was available. I met her and she calmly listened to my complaints, diagnosed my problem and gave me the right treatment. Within 5 days, there was 90 percentage improvement in my condition. Iam really grateful to Dr Rakhee. She is an excellent doctor and I genuinely recommend her based on my life saving experience ",

I honestly thought it will come under consulting. When I reached the next day , the receptionist told me to pay 500 and I said no I didn't know i have to pay and I was leaving in anger . SHE SHOULD INFORM POLICIES AND OTHER THING RIGHT AWAY. To which the doc Rakee and we spoke in the phone and her words were 'shouting and screaming ' , you have to pay , you have to pay . We have called him for you only. I said why are you forcing me. This is not a way to speak. She didn't let me speak at all. I asked can I atleast meet you as I'm eligible for it. She started screaming again ',that she has come for her son , her son is sick or she was with some patient. I am okay with anything *** *** **** ********** *** *** *** *** ***** ****** **** *** ****** *** **** No matter what , I will never ever vist this ******* ****** *** hospital ever. **** * *** ** ******  Till the end she screamed and the people infront of me just watched me and told me rudely that , don't speak anything just go, when I was trying to explain . The surgeon standing there was polite enough to let me speak and he said go on its okay and I said she was forcing me to pay. I didn't know . I was not using the service in the beginning anyway , they stopped me else I was gone. ** *** ****** * ***** ********** *** ** * **** ***** ***** * **** * **** ******* *** *** ****** ***** ****** *** ********* P.s I will never ever recommend this hospital and the doctor EVER .",

I honestly thought it will come under consulting. When I reached the next day , the receptionist told me to pay 500 and I said no I didn't know i have to pay and I was leaving in anger . SHE SHOULD INFORM POLICIES AND OTHER THING RIGHT AWAY. To which the doc Rakee and we spoke in the phone and her words were 'shouting and screaming ' , you have to pay , you have to pay . We have called him for you only. I said why are you forcing me. This is not a way to speak. She didn't let me speak at all. I asked can I atleast meet you as I'm eligible for it. She started screaming again ',that she has come for her son , her son is sick or she was with some patient. I am okay with anything *** *** **** ********** *** *** *** *** ***** ****** **** *** ****** *** **** No matter what , I will never ever vist this ******* ****** *** hospital ever. **** * *** ** ******  Till the end she screamed and the people infront of me just watched me and told me rudely that , don't speak anything just go, when I was trying to explain . The surgeon standing there was polite enough to let me speak and he said go on its okay and I said she was forcing me to pay. I didn't know . I was not using the service in the beginning anyway , they stopped me else I was gone. ** *** ****** * ***** ********** *** ** * **** ***** ***** * **** * **** ******* *** *** ****** ***** ****** *** ********* P.s I will never ever recommend this hospital and the doctor EVER .",
