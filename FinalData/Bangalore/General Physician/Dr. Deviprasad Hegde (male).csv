"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Outpatient treatment,",0,0,YES,"** ** **** *** *** **. As I met him in the year of September 2009  ( by unknowingly ) at Prashant Hospital, Bommanahalli for cardiac arrest treatment and till Today I am very much happy about his friendly treatment and advise.

I have lost his number and very badly searched his contact by calling all the hospital s in Bommanahalli area. Finally I found his contact in Google and booked an appointment through PRACTO Application.

I have highly confidence on his treatment and strongly recommend to all my relatives and friends.",2021-06-15 07:17:40,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

None,None,0,0,NO,"i wouldn't recommend this doctor as he is very arrogant. I took my father who is a farmer. we couldn't go back on time and he started shouting at my father. Also I was down with severe fever and shivering and i didn't get the appointment only my father has the appointment. when I requested him as I didn't get the appointment for myself and i have appointment only for my father and I am down with fever, doctor didn't give any medicine instead he suggested to go and have a check up outside. he can't treat me. I never seen any doctor with that much arrogance.",2023-12-02 00:40:10,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
