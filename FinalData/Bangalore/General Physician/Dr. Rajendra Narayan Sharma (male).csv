,,0,0,NO,"He seemed uninterested the entire time. He was using his phone, and did even notice when his patient left the room",2023-01-10 02:44:20,False,False,Yashwita Suvarna,,,
,,0,0,NO,"I had minor fever and went to doc. He asked me to test mp,typhoid,dengue and blood worth 6.5k with no reason as I had no symptom. The results came negative which was expected. He gave me calcium tablets and paracetamol. Paracetamol is understood but why calcium tablets in fever. I am not a doctor but this is basic. Although I have started taking Azithromycin he suggested me Amoxycillin. 

Not very happy this time when a basic blood test can show that I have viral fever.",2021-02-25 18:25:17,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
