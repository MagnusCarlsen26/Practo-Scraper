"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Diarrhoea,",0,0,NO,I was suffering from severe Diarrhea. I went to Motherhood hospital to consult and get medication. Upon reaching the hospital I was told that thr doctor wouldn't be able to come to the hospital as he is stuck in traffic. I was told to come back the next day evening. This is absolutely unacceptable behavior. I was already extremely weak due to illness and being a hospital instaed of providing an alternate doctor or medical assistance I was just asked to leave. I'm providing this feedback in the hope that the hospital will improve their behavior towards their patients.,2018-05-19 05:01:43,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
