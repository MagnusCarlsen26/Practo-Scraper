None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Adarsh is a pleasure to visit. She gives the right kind of weightage for the medical matters, she doesn’t hype any situation, neither does she underplay a diagnosis. 

I visited her for my father and it showed up in her experience even before she could look into the reports and called out the medical issue.

She also has treated my mother earlier.

I like the kind of positive energy needed from doctors, medicine is one thing and positivity for mental health is yet another important and critical aspect.",2024-03-14 06:13:06,False,True,Rebecca Newcastle,,,

None,None,0,0,NO,"She doesn’t listen to her patients at all. She is always in a hurry to complete the appointment. Behaviour not acceptable.

As she doesn’t listen carefully, the treatment is not effective.",2024-04-29 08:31:16,False,False,Subhadeep Pal,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,I donot recommend this doctor as she did not keep her words. She had told to watsup reports of blood test and told that she would send the prescription accordingly in watsup but after so many followups  she did not respond. I was expecting her reply but had to visit her next day in hospital only. This is not expected from any doctor when they tell to send the reports through watsup and no need to come to hospital in emergency cases. This was not acceptable as I kept her calling the whole day and I didn't receive any reply from her,2022-04-17 18:04:03,False,False,Suhaib Khan,,,
