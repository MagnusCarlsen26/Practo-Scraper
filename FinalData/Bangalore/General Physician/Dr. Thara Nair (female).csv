None,"Blood Pressure Changes,",0,0,NO,"Didn't think the staff was experienced enough, I had to visit another hospital the same day as there was no relief.

So on Practo the consultation Fee was mentioned Rs.400 but they charged me Rs.650 saying the fee is Rs.500 and Rs.150 bcoz you are a first time visitor.

Also it was mentioned on the slip that next 2 visits will be free of cost. I visited thrice but no staff available over the weekend and on Monday.

The next day when the staff was available, they charged me another Rs.100 just for monitoring the BP. (no doctor available.)

Overall it was horrible experience paying Rs.750, visited 5 times and no relief.",2016-06-30 07:32:27,False,False,Sheela Mehta,,,
