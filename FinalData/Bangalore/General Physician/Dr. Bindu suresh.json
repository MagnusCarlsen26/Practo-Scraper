She is a patient listener, will probe and understand the issues before recommending any tests (avoids unnecessary lab tests) and avoids prescribing unnecessary medicines and antibiotic. She was able to diagnose my problem so well which was wrongly diagnosed with another doctor at one of the corporate hospitals. Her pragmatic approach and her great sense of gut feeling is what me and my family love the most. She is always so approachable and now I visit Dr. Bindu for my whole family including my 4 year old daughter and my parents too. Thanks a zillion Dr. Bindu!",

She is a patient listener, will probe and understand the issues before recommending any tests (avoids unnecessary lab tests) and avoids prescribing unnecessary medicines and antibiotic. She was able to diagnose my problem so well which was wrongly diagnosed with another doctor at one of the corporate hospitals. Her pragmatic approach and her great sense of gut feeling is what me and my family love the most. She is always so approachable and now I visit Dr. Bindu for my whole family including my 4 year old daughter and my parents too. Thanks a zillion Dr. Bindu!",

This  time the infection has increased by 5 times , but she follows the same approach.\r\n\r\nUseless and waste of time. ",
