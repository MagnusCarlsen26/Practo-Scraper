I did not know any other doctors there and visited her as she only had appointments available that day. She seemed least interested to treat and was literally shouting at me. She was so rude. I told her I have gall bladder stone and I get this kind of pain once or twice a year..However she was so mean and said the symptoms u say are of cardiac arrest. First time in my life I have seen a doctor like this. They took the OP charges and then she directed me to go to emergency for scan etc. In emergency there were ** **** **** *** kind doctors. More than all medicines a patient needs empathy and kindness from a doctor. *** * ***** ***** **** ****** ******** ***** Hence I stepped out promising myself that I would never again consult this doctor again. In fact, I have never visited Manipal after that! ",

I have visited her to consult my mother's hypo-thyroid and increasing level of cholesterol. We perfectly knew that we may need to consult an endocrinologist but prior to that, just wanted to get an opinion. \n\nIt was my mistake not to do some background research and directly walking in to see any general physician. She was the only one available that day with some available slots. She was not at all interested to listen to the problem and keep on asking random questions without giving any time to answer. I gave her some blood test reports which we did few days back (without consulting any doctor) because it's a well known issue with my mother for last couple of years and the very first thing I had to hear from her was - \"am i look like a lab employee to you?\". \n\nShe was one of the most indecent, rude, impatient doctors I ever came across and won't ever recommend her to anyone for that matter.

On visiting Manipal and enquiring, I was told that the doctor I was looking for has already left and Dr.Anitha is the only one available. I chose to meet her since my BP was quite high and it was already late. When I entered and complained about my sleeplessness at nights and other issues due to high BP, she was too rude and asked, 'Why are you here? We can't treat for sleeplessness. Go and meet a psychiatrist'. She didn't even have the patience to listen to what I wanted to say. She kept asking me why I had come to general physician when I should go to a cardiologist. And, I kept telling her that I had come as my doctor suggested to. Throughout the time I was there, she just kept scolding my doctor who referred. She is too rude and indifferent. ",
