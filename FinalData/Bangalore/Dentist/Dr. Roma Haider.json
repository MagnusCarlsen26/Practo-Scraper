The removal caused residue and a cyst near that area which could not be diagnosed by my old dental clinic.Months later(nearly 6) i visited Apollo spectra,Dr.Roma first took me for consultation and ordered a CBCT scan in which they diagnosed the cyst and did cyst enuealation(removal) . Dr.Salim is currently taking care of my orthodontic treatment. My sister took her retainers from here .They treat you with utmost care and if you have any doubts just text them and they will respond for sure on your problem. I suggest anyone having dental problems to visit dr.Roma and dr.salim and not worry nor hesitate. once you go there the problem will be solved in your head, physically they will take care. I am glad to have found them. ",

The extraction of tooth was done with utmost  dexterity and under continuous monitoring.  They worked beyond their working hours on that day and left hospital after making sure that I am accompanied by my family.  They are not only meticulous professionals but very philonthrophic and humanitarian.   You feel safe in their hands.  I highly recommend these doctors who make every effort to give utmost satisfaction to their patients and they are very, very patient and empathetic.  Before going forward with any procedure, they will give all the options available  to the patient and the pros and cons are discussed and then conclusions are made with patient's consent.  Amazing doctors.  ",

The removal caused residue and a cyst near that area which could not be diagnosed by my old dental clinic.Months later(nearly 6) i visited Apollo spectra,Dr.Roma first took me for consultation and ordered a CBCT scan in which they diagnosed the cyst and did cyst enuealation(removal) . Dr.Salim is currently taking care of my orthodontic treatment. My sister took her retainers from here .They treat you with utmost care and if you have any doubts just text them and they will respond for sure on your problem. I suggest anyone having dental problems to visit dr.Roma and dr.salim and not worry nor hesitate. once you go there the problem will be solved in your head, physically they will take care. I am glad to have found them. ",

The extraction of tooth was done with utmost  dexterity and under continuous monitoring.  They worked beyond their working hours on that day and left hospital after making sure that I am accompanied by my family.  They are not only meticulous professionals but very philonthrophic and humanitarian.   You feel safe in their hands.  I highly recommend these doctors who make every effort to give utmost satisfaction to their patients and they are very, very patient and empathetic.  Before going forward with any procedure, they will give all the options available  to the patient and the pros and cons are discussed and then conclusions are made with patient's consent.  Amazing doctors.  ",
