She is very friendly, reassuring and is extremely patient in answering questions and explaining procedures to young patients and elder alike.
 
I have also taken my 88 year old father for dental issues. She understands what is important for him and does not extend the treatment to more than what is required.

When we work on young children, the time framework will be taken into consideration, depending on the behaviour of the individual child. As the child has come for the extraction of shaking tooth, that is pre shedding mobility, the local anaesthetic spray was used to make the gum tissue numb for few minutes, before the shaking tooth was gently removed. The local anesthetic spray bottle always comes with bent pipe for easy access to different areas of mouth. Once the spraying is done, the nozzle and the pipe will be disinfected with surgical spirit. We give utmost importance for sterilization.. All the surgical tools used will be autoclaved and packed in steripak. We never do any procedure with out gloves, unless some patients are allergic to latex gloves, alternative nitrile gloves will be used.",2024-02-29T01:35:00+0000,Dr. Neeraja Raju

According to the crown selected, the biological principles of crown preparation will be done and the measurement will be taken and the lab will fabricate the crown which is custom made according to the particular space availability which will be seated by using a special luting cement. This is how the crowns are prepared for permanent teeth. In case of children teeth, after pulpectomy is done we have custom made crowns called stainless steel crowns which are prefabricated and come in 7 sizes . Depending on the size of the deciduous tooth, the particular size of stainless steel crown will be selected and a slight proximal clearance will be created and the crown will be seated .
