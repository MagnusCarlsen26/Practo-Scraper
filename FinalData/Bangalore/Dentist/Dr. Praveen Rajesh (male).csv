It was during the lock down I had visited the clinic. I'm sure Dr. Kritika would vouch for the situation in which I had come. Though they were handling another patient, Dr. Praveen quickly helped in arresting the shooting pain first so that he could finish with the other patient in the meantime. 

Once it was my turn, Praveen attended my case. 

Firstly, I had visited because of a shooting pain in the decayed teeth which I was prolonging the pain using the usual pain killers. Once it was time I couldn't prolong it anymore, I decided that i'll see a dentist. 

Praveen carefully examined my case and using his gizmos showed on the bigger screen the condition of my teeth. (P.S. He is also a dental photographer so ask for nice pics of your teeth later). He identified that I needed two RCTs and some filling for the slightly decayed teeth. 

The treatment was a step by step procedure which got done in 3 sittings and 1 sitting for the caps. Again, 3 sittings is because i had a huge amount of puss which had to subside so that he could continue with the RCT. 

Post RCT, the caps were put on and had to come another day to check on the positioning of the caps. 

I still have my fillings, one extraction and two implants to be done yet.. so will write about that in the next review. 

Also, they maintain all your records on the cloud, so in case you are else where and you need your reports/records, they would be glad to share it with you/the dentist. 

Dr. Praveen: Chilled out doc. Charming personality. (P.S.: Sorry girls, he is taken) Patiently explains the procedure. Shows the pictures and videos of the treatment (Pre&Post). Doesn't beat around the bush but is straight out in telling you what is the best. More than timely resolution which most of the dentists do, Praveen is more of a preventive care specialist. He not only sorts out the issue but also focuses more on the preventive part so that you don't have to come back again with a bigger problem. 

Dr. Kritika: Super cool doctor. Though she didn't attend my case (She is a Pediatric Dentist), she was there throughout. It was super fun. 

It was actually super fun. It was more like I came there to hang out with two of my friends and it was all laughter and enjoyment throughout.

I had an amazing experience with Dr.Praveen Rajesh and Dr. Swarna. This visit was for me where I had severe gum problems with pain and bleeding. 

Dr.Praveen Rajesh listened to my problem very calmly and examined my tooth and explained that it is due to Hard plaque formation on the gums, he clearly explained what treatment he is going to do. I was very scared to visit a dentist and kept postponed many years because the pain which I underwent during my childhood days is unforgettable. Dr.Praveen understood my fear and suggested a Nitrous oxide sedation method which made me more comfortable so that we don’t get anxious.

Dr.Swarna did the procedure and no pain was experienced during the entire procedure. I got my teeth back as to how it was before. She is a brilliant dentist, with utmost compassion towards the comfort of me.

She also explained the brushing techniques and showed the before and after treatment photos which makes it very clear for me to understand and witness the results. She is just brilliant and a master of her trade and I highly recommend her.

The clinic is very neat and well maintained. Appointments well in time and completed the procedure on time. Highly professional with great expertise.
