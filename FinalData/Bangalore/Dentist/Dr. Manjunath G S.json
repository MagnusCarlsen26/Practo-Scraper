                "review_text": "Due to a complicated issue with my right jaw in childhood I have had some dental issues throughout my life. Overall I was very very hesitant to visit any dentist for a very long period of time (scared would be more accurate). Due to this I was postponing getting permanent dental implants for quite a few years even though I knew that was the best solution. \n                                                                                               All this changed after I visited Dr Manjunath. \nDue to the complicated nature of the implant required in my case the dentist I visited earlier were not sure how to provide the best solution for me. Dr. Manjunath after looking at the X-Rays and scans immediately formulated a detailed plan for treatment. He discussed the full plan with me and gave me  100% confidence in the result. Due to the complex nature of my implant and uneven bone structure it took a few attempts to get the proper fit for my prosthetics. The doctor used every tool in his vast experience and knowledge base to design the most appropriate implants suited for me. Over the course of my visits, and with Dr Manjunath's confidence, positivity and mastery on his craft I slowly lost all my fear and hesitation. The process was a 100% success. I cannot thank Dr Manjunath enough \nand this is the only dental clinic I would recommend for my friends and family.",

I arrived a bit early and after apologising for postponing the appointment, they started on time and I was done in about 15-20 mins. \n\nThe doc was super friendly and even explained each step as he was doing it. He let me know how the next step will feel so I could mentally prepare. I appreciated this the most because there were no surprises and it made me feel like he knew what\u2019s gonna happen even before he did it. I even drove back home after and had no swelling, no pain and could talk (against their advice) almost like nothing happened.  Overall a great doc, super fun and professional, very positive vibe and he really knows what he\u2019s doing. You\u2019re in very safe hands if you go here. ",

Overall I was very very hesitant to visit any dentist for a very long period of time (scared would be more accurate). Due to this I was postponing getting permanent dental implants for quite a few years even though I knew that was the best solution. \n                                                                                               All this changed after I visited Dr Manjunath. \nDue to the complicated nature of the implant required in my case the dentist I visited earlier were not sure how to provide the best solution for me. Dr. Manjunath after looking at the X-Rays and scans immediately formulated a detailed plan for treatment. He discussed the full plan with me and gave me  100% confidence in the result. Due to the complex nature of my implant and uneven bone structure it took a few attempts to get the proper fit for my prosthetics. The doctor used every tool in his vast experience and knowledge base to design the most appropriate implants suited for me. Over the course of my visits, and with Dr Manjunath's confidence, positivity and mastery on his craft I slowly lost all my fear and hesitation. The process was a 100% success. I cannot thank Dr Manjunath enough \nand this is the only dental clinic I would recommend for my friends and family.",

I arrived a bit early and after apologising for postponing the appointment, they started on time and I was done in about 15-20 mins. \n\nThe doc was super friendly and even explained each step as he was doing it. He let me know how the next step will feel so I could mentally prepare. I appreciated this the most because there were no surprises and it made me feel like he knew what\u2019s gonna happen even before he did it. I even drove back home after and had no swelling, no pain and could talk (against their advice) almost like nothing happened.  Overall a great doc, super fun and professional, very positive vibe and he really knows what he\u2019s doing. You\u2019re in very safe hands if you go here. ",

Other doctor was also very professional. Their charges are also reasonable. Another important thing that I noted was that he doesn't prescribe unnecessary medication, or coax you into unnecessary procedures.\nWould gladly recommend this place to be considered as the first choice in Bangalore if you are looking for a Dental treatment or implants.

Dr drained out the pus which gave me a lot of relief and subsequently Dr extracted the tooth. \n\nDr is very friendly and explains the situation and the options. He is Dentist with Empathy. Also, the front office as well as support staff are very helpful.\n\nOverall a pleasant experience and I have recommended my friends and my extended family.

My treatment by Dr Manjunath over a span of few weeks went perfectly fine. The team of Dr Manjunath and Dr Bettina is excellent including the staff involved. They are friendly, understanding, considerate with the patient requirements, punctual and more importantly great at their dental practice.

Doctor took time to examine the teeth but didn\u2019t do any additional examination as i was just vaccinated the day before and pain was expected. Instead doctor advised to use a mouthwash and take painkiller twice daily to manage the pain and planned to carry out further examination post 3-4 days by the time effects of vaccination are expected to wean off. \n\nUpon using the mouthwash,to my surprise the pain reduced significantly and the painkiller further helped to manage it. And as advised by the doctor the pain reduced and disappeared within the next 3-4 days. Thank you doctor!!",
