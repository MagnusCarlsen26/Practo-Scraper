"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Cavity Filling,",0,0,YES,"I lost a portion of my 20 year old cavity filled molar tooth while eating dinner and wanted to get it addressed at the earliest. Honestly I was looking for a dentist close to my home so that I could make multiple visits easily, if required. A quick Google map search, and I figured that not only is Dr. Rupali's clinic closest to my home, its even the one with the highest rated reviews.

Dr. Rupali is very warm and approachable. She listened to my case and inspected my tooth. Next she brings up a piece of paper and illustrates my tooth, the issue and the options to fix it. She tells me the two options, the pros and cons and which is cost effective. 

Dr. Rupali is methodical in her approach and ensures that he team adheres to her instructions. Before starting the procedure, she tells me in case I feel pain or discomfort to alert her and she will administer anaesthesia. However throughout the procedure I did not feel any pain and the whole procedure completed without any discomfort. Dr. Rupali is very patient and ensured the reconstruction was done perfectly. My session lasted for half an hour and I felt like I got my natural tooth back.

One point worth mentioning is that I had been to the clinic with my seven year old daughter. Dr Rupali made sure my daughter sat in the doctor's cabin during my procedure rather than the waiting lobby. This goes to show her compassion and presence of mind. I'm really thankful to Dr. Rupali's service and would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone requiring an experienced dentist for effective treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I was pleasantly surprised the second I walked in the door...
no pretentious dentists or receptionists here! From the waiting room to the chair, I felt completely at ease, with Dr Rupali checking in on me throughout the entire procedure to ensure I was comfortable and understood what she was doing - and why. 

Dr. Rupali is very calm and gentle, her manner is very soothing and reassuring. With a fantastic experience, I left the clinic feeling confident I'd made the right choice, based purely on my spouse recommendation. 
I am very happy to receive 10 years of warranty on my dental crown.I highly recommend this practice to patients young and old who like to be informed of the treatments they're receiving and being treated like a person, not a number.
