Iam so happy with the braces treatment I had undergone during my time as the doctor aarathi is so friendly and comfortable and a genuine doctor whom I have met so far, coming to the treatment she explained me everything and the pros and cons ofcourse which any dentist will be letting us know but she is the one who makes sure whether the patient is comfortable or not and then only start the treatment.
I went to her for my braces treatment and I came to know there are so many other issues which we need to overcome at first, and I was scared as I haven't been to any treatment till this time which I went and it's only because of the doctor who made me comfortable....
So going back to my treatment firstly I was scared how this end up but slowly I came to know that it is fine with doctors advice.
My only regret is that as it my last phase of treatment and unfortunately my location has changed due to some reasons and I can't able to continue with my doctors treatment...
Anyways I am keen observer who is observing her past one year and she is one of the good and kind and genuine doctors I have met....so to add a little happiness and the strength to whoever may come across this review I recommend doctor aarthi to you guys and even Dr Shiva Prasad...(orthodontist).
