He makes an effort to keep the patient comfortable during the surgery by creating a light-hearted environment and engaging the patient in regular conversations. \n\nDr. Shruthi K V also played a vital role in my surgery as a supporting hand and ensured that I remained calm & comfortable during the entire surgery. She has previously assisted my sibling with RC & crown fixing. She too regularly follows up to see if the patient is doing well post treatment. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve had an amazing experience with all the doctors at Smile Align Clinic & I\u2019m hoping to get extra ordinary results post completion of my metallic braces treatment. Would definitely recommend these doctors to anyone looking for a seamless dental experience. ",

I knew I had put off a cleaning for too long, my pain tolerance is low and I had bad experiences with other places before. I did a ton of research to find the most reputable and most gentle dentist I could find and it led me here. I live in Electronic city, by the way and made the trek all the way to Hebbal for the visit. And I\u2019m so, so glad I did. The associate dentist took her time to explain everything to me, calm me down, and give clear guidance. She has such a comforting presence and I couldn\u2019t have asked for anyone better. For my actual procedure, Dr. Shivanand came in and (wow, truly) he\u2019s the best dentist I\u2019ve ever had. He listened to every concern I had, no matter how silly I thought I sounded, always checked to make sure I was okay and I swear has the most steady and gentle way of working ever. I could tell that it could have been so uncomfortable (and even painful) IF he wasn\u2019t the one doing it. I\u2019ll never ever go anywhere else and could not recommend this clinic more!",

While I was initially concerned about the level of compliance required for Invisalign to be effective, integrating it into part of my daily routine has turned out to be straightforward after the first couple of months from starting the treatment. In my experience, inculcating the habit (of removing/replacing aligners during mealtimes) is relatively easy once it has been formed.\n\nMy full treatment is estimated to take around 2 years, but I am already seeing significant gains, especially on my front teeth. Side benefits of Invisalign include (a) tremendous improvement in health of my gums with the increased attention and guidance from Dr Shivananda, and (b) greater attention in keeping to regular mealtimes (and avoiding snacks in between!).\n\nPrices for both Invisalign and generic dental treatments are also very competitive / reasonable, in my opinion. I would highly recommend SmileAlign Clinic as a one-stop solution for any dental and orthodontic procedures.",

Dr. Shivanad met me the next day and advised the surgery. \n\nThere are no words to express for Dr. Rathna, the Surgeon. She was very professional, highly caring and very high on customer service. Throughout the two extractions in an hour, one was a very delicate surgery, Dr. Rathna handled it very gracefully. She gave me enough breathing space and helped in reducing my stress. Much respect Dr. Rathna. \n\nDr. Shruti was in constant touch to make sure that I was doing well during the course of my treatment. Thank you so much Dr. Shruti. \n\nIn this day and age, very few dental clinics operate like this. Dr. Shivanand, this speaks very high of your vision, leadership and the customer delight you offer to us. I have recommended this place to my family and friends. \n\nGod bless SmileAlign. Let people be healed through your service. \n\nThank you, \nVarghese \n\n ",

He makes an effort to keep the patient comfortable during the surgery by creating a light-hearted environment and engaging the patient in regular conversations. \n\nDr. Shruthi K V also played a vital role in my surgery as a supporting hand and ensured that I remained calm & comfortable during the entire surgery. She has previously assisted my sibling with RC & crown fixing. She too regularly follows up to see if the patient is doing well post treatment. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve had an amazing experience with all the doctors at Smile Align Clinic & I\u2019m hoping to get extra ordinary results post completion of my metallic braces treatment. Would definitely recommend these doctors to anyone looking for a seamless dental experience. ",

I knew I had put off a cleaning for too long, my pain tolerance is low and I had bad experiences with other places before. I did a ton of research to find the most reputable and most gentle dentist I could find and it led me here. I live in Electronic city, by the way and made the trek all the way to Hebbal for the visit. And I\u2019m so, so glad I did. The associate dentist took her time to explain everything to me, calm me down, and give clear guidance. She has such a comforting presence and I couldn\u2019t have asked for anyone better. For my actual procedure, Dr. Shivanand came in and (wow, truly) he\u2019s the best dentist I\u2019ve ever had. He listened to every concern I had, no matter how silly I thought I sounded, always checked to make sure I was okay and I swear has the most steady and gentle way of working ever. I could tell that it could have been so uncomfortable (and even painful) IF he wasn\u2019t the one doing it. I\u2019ll never ever go anywhere else and could not recommend this clinic more!",

While I was initially concerned about the level of compliance required for Invisalign to be effective, integrating it into part of my daily routine has turned out to be straightforward after the first couple of months from starting the treatment. In my experience, inculcating the habit (of removing/replacing aligners during mealtimes) is relatively easy once it has been formed.\n\nMy full treatment is estimated to take around 2 years, but I am already seeing significant gains, especially on my front teeth. Side benefits of Invisalign include (a) tremendous improvement in health of my gums with the increased attention and guidance from Dr Shivananda, and (b) greater attention in keeping to regular mealtimes (and avoiding snacks in between!).\n\nPrices for both Invisalign and generic dental treatments are also very competitive / reasonable, in my opinion. I would highly recommend SmileAlign Clinic as a one-stop solution for any dental and orthodontic procedures.",

I am so glad that I went for the X-ray and the Scan, that revealed an additional problem. Dr. Shivanad met me the next day and advised the surgery. \n\nThere are no words to express for Dr. Rathna, the Surgeon. She was very professional, highly caring and very high on customer service. Throughout the two extractions in an hour, one was a very delicate surgery, Dr. Rathna handled it very gracefully. She gave me enough breathing space and helped in reducing my stress. Much respect Dr. Rathna. \n\nDr. Shruti was in constant touch to make sure that I was doing well during the course of my treatment. Thank you so much Dr. Shruti. \n\nIn this day and age, very few dental clinics operate like this. Dr. Shivanand, this speaks very high of your vision, leadership and the customer delight you offer to us. I have recommended this place to my family and friends. \n\nGod bless SmileAlign. Let people be healed through your service. \n\nThank you, \nVarghese \n\n ",

I just had one month to get my treatment started since my visa was only for a month and he planned it so meticulous and flawlessly that my Invisalign was fitted in just 3 weeks. I\u2019m so impressed with the quality of not just the treatment but the care provided by Dr Shivananda and his team. Thank you for all your efforts and may God bless you all.

Besides he\u2019s available at his centre almost all times (except during his abroad visits every month). Appointment scheduling is easy and they don\u2019t make you wait for a long time despite his busy schedule. Also the cost factor, he\u2019s probably most economical braces dentist in this locality. He gave me wide range of options and specified that all were tools for him to correct my smile. I would definitely recommend him to others for their smile correction.",

Before I went through SmileAlign website and found Dr Shiva\u2019s profile very impressive (quite a journey I must say). He\u2019s worked on quite a bit of Invisalign cases and reviews were great. Then I communicated my interest towards Invisalign on their email. Voila! I received and instant reply from them. Dr Shiva then made a video call to understand and examine my smile problems. He explained me about the 3D scanning and sent me some videos of it, of his patients to understand it. Also he showed me some pictures of before and after with Invisalign treatment. Next thing, I\u2019m in Bangalore for the scan and I received my Invisalign trays in Dubai in less than 3 weeks. Can you believe it. He explained me how to wear the trays and I\u2019m wearing since 4 months, just about done with my smile correction. I very highly recommend him. He\u2019s an amazing guy, full of energy. Thanks Dr Shiva.",

I can honestly say that I looked forward to each one of my visits with this set up and am sad that I will now only be seeing them for teeth cleanings :) Thank you again for making my dreams a reality!",

I have massive dental fear and I avoid the dentist at all cost. At first impression they seemed real kind and answered all my questions. I felt comfortable enough to make am appointment. The next day the pain increased and didnt know what to do. I tried to push through the day and try to work through the pain. By time I got home the pain was so unbearable that I couldn't take it anymore. I called up clinic for an appointment and The next morning the front office called me to check on me. She gave me the first available appointment for Friday and got an anitbiotic also painkillers. It helped me a lot.\nOn Saturday both Doctors took very good care of me during the procedure. The procedure took longer than anticipated but they worked together to finish the first part. I'm so happy with my service. I hate going to the dentist. Its one of my biggest fears. I highly recommend anyone with dental anxiety to come to this facility. They are kind, gentle, and go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and safe. I'm so impressed. In fact I am happy to go again. Thank you!",

From the free initial assessment to the treatment itself, their care, professionalism and expertise has been outstanding. I chose VitaSmiles after an initial visit and consultation with Dr Shivanand who is so sound on diagnosis and giving a plan which is practical and easy on pocket too. Dr Shivanand is quite simply the dentist who is foremost I have ever had dental treatment with. His team are also superb , making the whole experience first class. I honestly can say I experienced no pain, and not once did I feel anything but total confidence and relaxed in the hands of Dr Shivanand and his team. My treatment included implants, root canal surgery, bridges and crowns and the cost of this has been an enormous saving over what it would have cost in the UK. I would say to anybody considering dental work, visit VitaSmiles Dental Clinic, get a professional opinion of what needs to be done from some of the finest dentists in Bangalore and then place your trust in them. I really am so pleased I decided to use them for the work I needed , and I would like to add that in no way whatsoever am I being paid or rewarded for my comments. I just feel that when you have an incredible experience then you should tell people about it ! My thanks to Dr Shivanand and his team, and all the staff for making my experience an absolutely brilliant one!",

Their offices are modern, and extremely clean with a lovely set up. I have only had my cleaning by Dr Shivanand, and only reason why I have requested for his time and time again is due to his overall professionalism, passion for his craft, warm energy and thorough ability to clean my teeth. He is always a pleasure to see and most importantly talk to during my visits to catch up with one another lives and crack jokes throughout the appointment together to make the process more enjoyable. Dr Shivanand is extremely patient as well and offers me break times if needed, but I have always been a person to enjoy wellness and cleaning my teeth where I have now become one of his patient who looks forward to my cleanings just to have the luxury of passing the tip of my tongue on my teeth to feel how squeaky clean they are after I see him. Thank you to both VitaSmiles Dental & Shivanand for always having my teeth in the best of shape! Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed with your decision to give them a try!",

So thought I\u2019ll consult him because Previously I had poor to average treatments from other dentists. After meeting him, my perception changed entirely. It was a humbling experience and the way he talks and comforts you on the treatment isn\u2019t really awesome. \nHe took almost half an hour for explaining the issues and gave me a stepwise solutions for my problems and how it had to be addressed based on the priority of the problem.\nThe best part of it was that he didn\u2019t take an single penny for the time spent and advice given. He says \u201cBeing a doctor this is one way I would like to give back to the society \u201c. And I was like what an amazing guy!\n\nPS: He\u2019s a visiting consultant abroad, travels every month. So getting an appointment is bit difficult.\n\n",

Always available, he patiently addressed all my questions throughout my treatment. \n\nDr. Shivanand would not take any shortcuts, removing my braces only when my jaw clicking and mouth opening issues were addressed, referring me to a TMJ specialist and co-ordinating with him. Mine was not an easy case and almost every other orthodontist recommended an extraction, but Dr. Shivanand said he would try to correct my alignment without teeth extraction and followed through on his word.\n\nI found him to be a doctor who genuinely places the long-term health of his patients first. I recommend Dr. Shivanand in the highest of terms for anyone getting ortho treatment. ",

The first time I visited the clinic, my issues were identified spot on, there was a gap being formed in my front two teeth due to my bite being improper. Doctor suggested that I should right away wear braces to solve this issue totally. I wore it for about 5 months. It's an art that only experts can do and I was in safe hands. I was always excited to visit the clinic for my check ups because, the wait time is very less and the entire team is happy to receive you and are very cooperative.Dr. Shivanand is an extremely passionate doctor with high level skills that he performs with ease along with customer satisfaction as his highest priority, a rare blend! Highly recommended for any dentals concerns :) ",

The crown colour was not precise (but I guess artificial tooth cannot replace natural ones) how we had pictured it and he offered to redo it for free when I did my teeth whitening at a later stage. His bedside manner and informative style put me at ease and I came out 4 hours later with a complete, smile. I will return to them for further treatments due to the good service and attention I received.",

And after the fix , I need not worry about it for years. While ,other dentists around the city  suggested more implants and never gave me a Hope that my tooth can get better ,or say look better. Shivananda did suggest good options, I  started taking his treatment last year and as he planned , I see the alignment of the teeth getting better over the few months. Less implants , so obviously cost effective , Hope to see my wide smile  soon . ",

With one examination he said he can correct it with Damon braces and not necessary to undergo face belt therapy. He simply stuck to his promise in the next 10 months. He corrected the jaw problem. My daughter looks very good now, remarkable change. Very highly recommend his expertise.\n",

He got me an appointment for 3D scan of teeth which showed me how my teeth would look like after the treatment was to be completed. It was really a state-of-the-art technology. He took some pictures and within 3-4 days showed me on how my step by step and monthly changes would look like. I got the Invisalign in 3 weeks and now in 7 months he completed my treatment which was indeed astonishing. Thank you so much. The best part about him is that he is a great listener and addresses to all the concerns. Also he is available at all times to be contacted even on Sundays or holidays which is really great for his stature.",

At the same time, we are unhappy to know that you were disappointed with the charges this time although you did not take the treatment from us. \n\nThe current COVID crisis is a testing and trying one not just for patients and doctors but most of the population. More so for dentists especially as they have to work in the oral cavity and risk is as much as 100% transmission chances if a positive COVID patient is encountered. Since our screening protocols are strict we are sure that we might not encounter a \u201csick\u201d COVID patient but there could be certain ASYMPTOMATIC COVID patients who show absolutely normal characteristics and parameters in the screening regulations. Hence we have to follow protocols set by the Government of India, Dental Council of India and Health & Family Welfare, Karnataka State inorder to safeguard and minimize the transmission of the disease to the patients, doctors, associate staff and the community at large.\nTo implement this, we will require DISPOSABLE Personal Protective Equipments (PPE). Some of them are:\n1.\tNon woven coverall gown ( For doctor and assistant)\n2.\tN95 masks (For doctor and assistant)\n3.\tProtective eyewear (For doctor and assistant)\n4.\tFace shield (For doctor and assistant)\n5.\tAdditional 3ply masks and gloves\n\nSo the additional charges enforced upon you were for the above. These cost around Rs 1000-1500 for the good quality and the Government approved ones. A simple Google search will enable you to confirm and have a basic idea on costs of these in the market. The same was actually added along with the procedure cost to you. The procedure cost was unchanged from last time when you had approached us in the month of February. \n\nI hope you now understand the reason behind the increase in the costs which inturn is because of increase in the costs of the PPEs. We have already written a mail to the Government of Karnataka to help us curb the corruption which exists in certain sectors who are making using of the situation and are increasing the cost of the PPEs by 200-300%. Hopefully we get a positive and a hasty response. In the meantine, We would want to affirm and ensure that patient, staff and community safety is of prime importance to us at this crucial juncture and will continue to follow the protocols that is safe and accurate.\n\nThanks & regards,\nTeam SmileAlign",

For example, when I got my braces, and had to get a cap as well which I barely had an idea of, while Dr. Shivanandh  was very supportive, and got me  thorough the procedure by explaining it clearly. He is a professional and has a naturally lovely personality. I would recommend Dr. Shivanandh  to everyone. He is the best dentist I have ever been to :).\n",
