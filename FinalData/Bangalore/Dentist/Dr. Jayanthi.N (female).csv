We normally ensure that the treatments rendered to the best standards.
The same was done for your 3.8 year old son as well.
As explained in my communication to you earlier when you raised concerns same I repeat.
The treatment has been impeccable.
However there has been total ignorance towards our post procedure instructions by the Local Guardians under whose care the child is as informed by you . 
Also you didn't bring him for follow ups after repeated calls.
