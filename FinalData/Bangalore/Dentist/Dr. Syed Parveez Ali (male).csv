"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,Tooth Coloured Fillings,Dental X-Ray,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Dear All,

I’m here to share my first Dental visit experience, 
Recently I visited sunshine dental care in Rt.Nagar,Bangalore.

As my Tooth had been hurting for months. I have undergone composite restoration and wisdom tooth extraction.
Composite restoration is a treatment done to my decay tooth, after this my tooth restored back to normal function and shape which also helps for preventing further decay.

I wanna share that I had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Parveez, He is very professional and he takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice, It's not easy to find a good dentist. 
And surprisingly this is my first visit to a dentist. If any one of you have fear of dentists once go and visit sunshine dental care. I highly recommend Dr. Parveez. He made me feel less nervous about my treatment. Your efforts are much appreciated Dr. 
After my visit my best suggestion is that An early first visit to the dentist could arrest the progress of dental caries.

Remember the thing that No one can take our smile away when dental decay is kept miles away.

Thank you so much Dr. Syed Parveez Ali's - Sunshine Dental Care
