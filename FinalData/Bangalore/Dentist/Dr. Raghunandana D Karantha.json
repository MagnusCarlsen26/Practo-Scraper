However I decided to go ahead with Dr Raghunandan after going through the reviews and trust me, this has been the best decision ever. He is simply a magician who is extremely good at his craft and before you even know the treatment would be over.He is assisted by his wife Mrs Mallika who is equally good. Both of them are extremely good at comforting a patient as well. So you can trust them without any doubt. Thank you Dr. Raghunandan and Dr Mallika.",

However I decided to go ahead with Dr Raghunandan after going through the reviews and trust me, this has been the best decision ever. He is simply a magician who is extremely good at his craft and before you even know the treatment would be over.He is assisted by his wife Mrs Mallika who is equally good. Both of them are extremely good at comforting a patient as well. So you can trust them without any doubt. Thank you Dr. Raghunandan and Dr Mallika.",
