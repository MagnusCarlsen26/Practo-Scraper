Then i happened to meet Soumya who greets me with a bright smile and then explained me what the process is going to be. i was very skeptical and nervous but the way she handled it i must say phenominal. Top notch service. i am so brave now that i am ready for rootcanal for all 32 teeth. never knew root canal treatment was this painless. she made it look very easy. she will talk to you like shes your best friend. she will reply to your calls and sms about treatments.Thank you soumya. i am now able to eat anything and everything from right side of my mouth ;-).

Then i happened to meet Soumya who greets me with a bright smile and then explained me what the process is going to be. i was very skeptical and nervous but the way she handled it i must say phenominal. Top notch service. i am so brave now that i am ready for rootcanal for all 32 teeth. never knew root canal treatment was this painless. she made it look very easy. she will talk to you like shes your best friend. she will reply to your calls and sms about treatments.Thank you soumya. i am now able to eat anything and everything from right side of my mouth ;-).
