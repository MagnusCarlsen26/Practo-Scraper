,,0,0,YES,"I recently finished my three-year orthodontic treatment with Dr. Chethan S. and I'm so grateful for the incredible transformation! I initially had crooked teeth and an underbite, and Dr. Chethan S. thoroughly explained the treatment plan along with alternative options like clear aligners.

My teeth are now straight and perfectly aligned now and I have a confident smile.
He patiently listened to my concerns from the very beginning and answered all my questions in detail.

Throughout the treatment, Dr. Chethan S. displayed immense patience and a friendly demeanor. The clinic staff were also very welcoming and helpful. Even with occasional discomfort during adjustments, Dr. Chethan S. always offered solutions to minimize any pain
