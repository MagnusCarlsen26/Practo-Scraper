I would just say that i got lucky to meet Dr. Amruta, when she used to work in a different clinic before she opened Ivory Smiles. I have ever since then, been hooked to her for anything (small / big) related to teeth :).. not just me but my whole family - my parents, my husband and now my daughter & my friends. When you meet her aswell, you just know you have come to the right place!! Always a smile on her face and not to forget, she ensures all in her clinic treat patients with a lot of respect.

A few reasons why we all go back to Ivory Smiles and would choose to that even if we have travel a great deal of distance: 

1. First & foremost, Dr. Amruta and her team - extremely knowledgeable and great at their skill!
2. Politeness of her staff and all in the clinic. Treat you with great care and respect.
3. Hygiene & cleanliness at a 100% satisfaction level. Proper sanitization always.. 
4. Instruments & machines used for treatments are visibly high quality and thus the fees they charged is extremely reasonable for what you get in return!
5. Best quality Implants (no compromise whatsoever on quality)
6. High on Ethics & completely Transparent, starting from the word 'GO'.. you will not have to ask and if you do, they will patiently provide you all answers to all your questions.

A major reason for my confidence and blind faith on her - almost a decade back, had visited a known dentist for getting my teeth evaluated and the doctor got me super worried by saying i had 8 cavities which needed immediate remediation to avoid further decay...that's when i went for a second opinion, where I met Dr. Amruta and the rest is history... She thoroughly checked, and told me there were none.. its been almost 10 years and its now that ive undergone a filling for 1 tooth.. again painless treatment..my parents & my husband have gone through multiple RCTs and implants and all treatments have been to a 100% satisfaction...

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Implant / RCT,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Almost an year back, I've been referred to Dr. Amruta by a friend (one of her patient). I've a history of RCTs over last 15 years with treatment from 3 different locations across India.

Always skeptical about the dentist, quality of treatment and price being charged. 

My case:- I had 3 critical problems i.e. RCTs, Wisdom Tooth Extraction and Implant. Over last 1 year, Dr. Amruta and her team of Specialist has completed these procedures with best quality treatment and utmost patience.  

Root Canal Treatments - got completed 4 months back,10/10 

1. Regular X-Ray Scans & follow-ups with whatsapp, SMS and email based reminders 
2. Proper Treatment & explanation of the procedure 
3. <5 mins of waiting 
4. ZERO PAIN, most important  
5. Best Quality fillings & Crowns (almost 4+ months now, no issue)

WT Extraction - Completed, 10/10

1. No PAIN during the procedure (complete care) 
2. Proper Care and instructions post procedure 
3. 10/10 for Hygiene  

Tooth Implant - Completed, 10/10

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Bone Grafting for Dental Implants,Laser Gum Surgery,Composite tooth filling,Dental Implant,",0,0,YES,"This is a summary of multiple visits over the course of about 6 months.

I visited the clinic on the recommendation of my cousin brother who is also a dentist (in a different city), and now I would recommend
everyone to choose Ivory Smiles for any of your dental needs.

Dr. Amruta is extremely approachable & takes good care of her patients. She will take the time to understand your case, is sensitive to your needs & succinctly explains the process. She has a great bedside manner and ensures you are comfortable during any procedures you may get.

My treatment:
I have a congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisor. Prior to my treatment here I used to wear an RPD (denture). I had to visit this clinic because after several years of using the denture, it had broken - and I wanted to get a more permanent solution, a dental implant. After a couple of visits and scans (CBCT, etc) Dr. Amruta drew out a complete plan for me which involved some ortho, some laser surgery & finally a dental implant.
In other clinics I visited, they had similar plans but usually would only tackle the one problem (missing tooth). At Ivory Smiles, Dr. Amruta takes the time to make sure you feel good about your entire smile & she's very particular about the overall appearance of the teeth and her treatment plans are aligned with that (within reason).
We did not opt for Invisalign because it was a short treatment period & simple movements.
My ortho treatment was carried out for a period of 4-6 months by Dr. Anitha, the visiting orthodontist at the time, who is also really amazing. I was given a temporary bridge in that duration.
Post the ortho, the dental implant surgery itself was carried out very smoothly as this is Dr. Amruta's area of expertise - pain management was amazing & she talked me through the entire process. There were some minor gum correction laser treatments as well.

--

I am extremely happy with the final result of my treatment and my smile. Teeth are such an important part of your life which you don't realize how problematic their condition is until you see their effect on your life after they have undergone the right treatment.
In terms of pricing, I would say it is not the cheapest - but since this is a premium clinic you definitely get what you pay for.

Overall, to re-iterate I would unquestionably recommend anyone to choose Ivory Smiles! :)",2019-10-26 04:22:11,False,True,Aditi Mohanty,"Thank you for my patience and trust in us.

I visited Dr.Amruta at the stage were my Gums are in red in color and about to bleed and I can’t even able to bare the pain of drinking water touches my left gum and now I started eating both the sides.
Dr.Amruta is very Punctual and friendly in nature and very approachable and takes good care of her patients always with a smile and never made me to feel like she is giving less importance !!
She clearly explained problem I had and make me understood how severe it is and she explained about the laser treatment and treatment plan.Recommended to start the treatment without delaying as the delay in treatment leads my problem to much severe condition !!
I’m impressed with her treatment the way she explained the process before and while doing treatment!!  Background music was really awesome!!
Finally I’m happy with the result and now I can eat both the sides of  my teeth as earlier !!
Final thing to say, we are in a world as most of the doctors wash their hand after treatment ,But Dr.Amruta is totally different from others and she was very happy after seeing my improvements in Gum after her treatment.That was really impressive.

I am writing this review after almost 2 months of my treatment with the intention of helping people choose the right dentist. I have  been suffering with a gun disease due to which I have lost most of my teeth. My kids really convinced me to see a dentist but all the dentists I went to did not have a good solution. Some would say use dentures which I did not want for hygiene reasons and the rest told me to go for dental implants.  I knew this treatment would need special care and attention. Hence I started looking out for a good dentist. 
I met Dr Amruta almost 7 months ago and consulted her. Initially I was a little scared but in 45 mins of a conversation with her,i walked out of the room satisfied.  She is brilliant and answers all my questions with facts and patience. What I liked was the way she handles every patient. She is soft spoken and very good at her work. She told me I would need some scans and her receptionist helped me reach out for my cbct.
Next day I met her and she gave me a detailed plan. She had so much clarity which no other dentist could give me. She charted out a diet plan as I had difficulty in eating with few teeth.  We started out treatments soon and within 4 months I had a complete set of teeth. I got 8 implants placed and  I remember her saying,its my responsibility to make sure you get a healthy set of teeth. Most dentists wash their hands out of a patient after they get they money. But she is not at all like that.  I have been visiting her for all my check up and not once has she rushed or made me feel less important.God bless this soul and I would pray she helps more people like this and collect her blessings.  
Small note on the team of assistants- clean brilliant and efficient.they treat you like family.  Always smiling and will never say no. You can see for yourself if you visit them.  I would rate them 20/10 if I could. Thank you.
