It took almost 12 visits in total and almost 3 months for something that stared as a benign filling fall out and was quite painful.\n\nThe facilty is very clean, doctors are mostly professional but they say a great dental procedure is one that is as quick and painless as possible.

The cost of the artificial crown was high based on my choice, however there are other varieties that are available for cheaper, the choice depends on the tooth position and aesthetics. I would recommend them as Dr. Adarsha is a very senior professional having held esteemed positions across various major hospitals and trust that is built up over period of time.\nThe clinic is relatively new and neat with all procedures of disinfection carried out based on COVID guidelines.
