Through some research, I found Dr. Rajesh and scheduled one more consultation. The clinic was exceptionally clean and hygienic. Dr. Rajesh thoroughly explained the procedure, something I hadn't experienced in other consultations.\n\nAlthough the cost seemed a bit higher compared to others, I chose to proceed because I wanted the expertise and assurance of quality and longevity. The process began with a root implant, which required a 7-8 month wait for the roots to integrate. After this period, we decided to fix the crown. There was regular follow-ups to check the fit, and faced some complications due to teeth alignment.\n\nA trial session was done to ensured my comfort, and after making some adjustments, we finalised the implant. The implant was successfully placed, and I couldn't be happier with the results. The shape and size are exactly what I wanted. Though there are some initial discomfort, Dr. Rajesh  addressed my concerns and scheduled a follow-up.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about Dr. Rajesh is his straight forward attitude and commitment to perfection. I would highly recommend him and would like to thank him for his care.",

I was quite hesitant to undergo the complete treatment thinking about the painful process (opening gums and cleaning entire teeth) and also possible loss of weak teeth. I was only doing the peripheral cleaning once in a while which didn\u2019t help the purpose. With the advice from my wife, one consultation with Dr. Rajesh at Fresh Breath Dental Clinic has changed my perception about the treatment. He explained me the amount of damage that I\u2019m doing to my teeth and to the teeth bone by delaying the treatment. With lots of patience he explained me the while process, clearing all my doubts which gave me lot of confidence to prepare myself for the surgery removing my misconceptions and inhibitions.  \n\nHe planned the procedures in such a way that I get ample recovery time, live with regular routine and more importantly made it less painful experience. The overall procedure was done over a period of 6 weeks with one sitting each week. With hard tarter and bacteria never seen before, each sitting has tested the patience of Dr and also my cooperation. His attention to detail procedures and perfection not only helped me in getting rid of the bacteria and tartar that I accumulated though this disease but also retained my teeth.  \n\nThere are no words to describe how WONDERFUL my experience with Dr Rajesh at Fresh Breath Dental Clinic. To simply put, he gave rebirth for my teeth. Thanks a lot Dr. for the treatment and making my life better. \n",

Through some research, I found Dr. Rajesh and scheduled one more consultation. The clinic was exceptionally clean and hygienic. Dr. Rajesh thoroughly explained the procedure, something I hadn't experienced in other consultations.\n\nAlthough the cost seemed a bit higher compared to others, I chose to proceed because I wanted the expertise and assurance of quality and longevity. The process began with a root implant, which required a 7-8 month wait for the roots to integrate. After this period, we decided to fix the crown. There was regular follow-ups to check the fit, and faced some complications due to teeth alignment.\n\nA trial session was done to ensured my comfort, and after making some adjustments, we finalised the implant. The implant was successfully placed, and I couldn't be happier with the results. The shape and size are exactly what I wanted. Though there are some initial discomfort, Dr. Rajesh  addressed my concerns and scheduled a follow-up.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about Dr. Rajesh is his straight forward attitude and commitment to perfection. I would highly recommend him and would like to thank him for his care.",

I was quite hesitant to undergo the complete treatment thinking about the painful process (opening gums and cleaning entire teeth) and also possible loss of weak teeth. I was only doing the peripheral cleaning once in a while which didn\u2019t help the purpose. With the advice from my wife, one consultation with Dr. Rajesh at Fresh Breath Dental Clinic has changed my perception about the treatment. He explained me the amount of damage that I\u2019m doing to my teeth and to the teeth bone by delaying the treatment. With lots of patience he explained me the while process, clearing all my doubts which gave me lot of confidence to prepare myself for the surgery removing my misconceptions and inhibitions.  \n\nHe planned the procedures in such a way that I get ample recovery time, live with regular routine and more importantly made it less painful experience. The overall procedure was done over a period of 6 weeks with one sitting each week. With hard tarter and bacteria never seen before, each sitting has tested the patience of Dr and also my cooperation. His attention to detail procedures and perfection not only helped me in getting rid of the bacteria and tartar that I accumulated though this disease but also retained my teeth.  \n\nThere are no words to describe how WONDERFUL my experience with Dr Rajesh at Fresh Breath Dental Clinic. To simply put, he gave rebirth for my teeth. Thanks a lot Dr. for the treatment and making my life better. \n",

My mother was suffering from severe pain in her upper teeth and swelling, and our initial visit to another hospital left her in distress with the possibility of tooth extraction.\n\nThankfully, we decided to seek a second opinion from Dr. Rajesh Naik, and it was a game-changer. Dr. Naik quickly identified the root cause of my mother's dental problem, which stemmed from an injury that occurred nine years ago. This injury had led to the formation of an infection in her upper teeth.\n\nDr. Naik's diagnosis was clear: my mom needed surgery and a root canal. Understandably, my mother was apprehensive about the pain and the procedure itself. However, Dr. Naik's expertise and gentle approach put her at ease.\n\nThe surgery went smoother than we could have ever hoped for. Dr. Naik's skill and precision minimized any discomfort, and the pain was far less than expected.\n\nOur experience with Dr. Rajesh Naik was nothing short of exceptional. His professionalism, compassion, and dedication to his patients are truly commendable. He not only saved my mother's teeth but also her peace of mind.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Rajesh Naik to anyone seeking top-notch dental care. Thank you, Dr. Naik, for your outstanding expertise and for making a challenging situation manageable. You've made a lasting positive impact on our lives, and we are truly grateful.",

He did not judge my oral routine on seeing my tooth cavities and tartar. Instead, he helped me ease my worries.\n\nI went for a root canal. It was affordable, the process was painless, and the background ambiance music is soothing to relieve your nervousness.\n\nI would recommend Dr. Rajesh Naik and Fresh Breath Dental Clinic to anyone who wants a good affordable doctor who does not judge based on your oral health.\n\nI found my permanent dentist for a visit, I aim to visit this clinic once every 6 months!.",

He goes out of his way to explain in detail and that in turn gives you more confidence in him . I will be definitely visiting him for my cavity fillings as well. Highly recommended for everyone.",

I feel so much better post the RCT. His clinic is impeccably maintained and you feel very safe. I highly recommend him. ",

Finally he worked on the real issue which was diagnosed as a hairline fracture and hence had to go through though painful treatment of an infected root canal treatment . At that point it was painful but the patience shown by the doctor as well the detailing and analysis of all my earlier issues were discussed and kept in mind. \nI also have post surgery phobia because of my previous bad experience of a tooth job done by another dentist many years ago,  therefore handling me was not very easy,  but the Dr did a very good job with recovery . Though i am still not done with all my teeth related issues as they need to be addressed one by one., yet i feel so relieved and pain free after suffering for 2 weeks plus. \nHighly recommended Dr Rajesh Naik  \n",

Dr. Rajesh took considerable time in explaining us the approach and reasoning behind each of the proposed procedures for 5 of my son's tooth. What has worked really well for us is the doctor's friendliness and approachability both of which had played a vital role in my 4 yo son getting accquainted with the doctor and atmosphere. Thanks to which, we were able to complete procedures on 5 of my son's tooth (including rct and crowning) in a matter of 3 weeks in 3 sittings. We are indeed greatful to Dr. Rajesh for steering us in the right direction. I am sure that we would have spent considerable amount to fix all my son's dental issues had we not met Dr. Rajesh",

I'm glad that I met him. He explained me about the procedure after examining me. Was patient and listens to you. After 3 days with food information about the process I sat for the root canal process. I was still scared, he understood this and calmed me by informing every move he made. Oh, you get to hear Eric Clapton as well. I calmed so much during the operation that i started humming the songs he played. Good Playlists. Next session is what I'm looking forward to. Kudos Doc, you're a rare piece. ",
