"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Metal Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"A gifted orthodontist everyone knows. But also so much more

After 18 months of braces treatment with another doctor, who had slowly convinced me that I had gum issues ( which I did not), I was convinced that my smile would never be as I imagined it would be. 

One day after yet another consultation where the doctor tried to scare me further, something snapped and I decided to take a second opinion. 

That was the lucky day I met Dr. Chetak and I clearly remember it. 

I was lost, looked like I’d just recovered from a panic attack, and launched myself into a monologue about how my gum problems would fail my braces treatment. 

The doctor smiled and said, but who said you have a gum problem? 

I couldn’t believe it after 18 months of being told something was terribly wrong.  Turned out everything was ok except for an overbite.


That day and every consultation after changed my smile and outlook toward dentists. 

Dr.Chetak is very accomplished, popular, and experienced. Yet, he will remember patient history, hear them out as they rant, answer all the questions they may have, and give them the best possible result going out of his way. This is not just based on my experiences. I have noticed the quality of interactions he has with school kids, adults, or the elderly. I cannot think of a more optimistic and thoughtful dentist in all of Bangalore. He can bring out the best in his patients. He explains everything in detail and never loses his calm.

Over the last 6 months, he fixed my overbite issues very strategically, and accommodated my timeline amidst a very busy schedule and multiple lockdowns, all because I requested it. He went out of his way to accommodate a complicated permanent retainer just to minimize a relapse -- something others said would not be possible with the overbite!

Today, as he removed my braces to present a smile that beats my imagination, I am filled with gratitude. Very few dentists can do this tactically brilliant job. Almost nobody can do it without instilling fear in the patient or overcharging them. Only Dr.Chetak managed to do all of it!

If you need a good orthodontist, look no further. You will get a smile you love and meet a doctor who will set very high standards for all those you meet later. 

Thank you, doctor, although it is too small a word. I owe you my smile. Quite literally! :)

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Dentofacial Orthopedics,",0,0,YES,"Can't decide if 5 stars are enough for the treatment, the clinic environment, the doctor, the unbelievable patience he has, and the warmth he makes you feel.

After almost 3 years of teeth alignment treatment with my previous doctor, I got referred to Dr. Chetak Shetty and I now feel that he was godsent for me.

His approach to the problem is unconventional and his experience shines in his methods. What my previous doctor told would take a year or more to complete, Dr. Shetty finished it in 6-7 months. That's how fast his treatment is, not just with me but with all the other patients.

He is good-humored, understanding, and listens to all your problems with patience. At the end of the treatment, I was not only left with beautifully aligned teeth but also with an inspiration to be as passionate and as professional as he is. Thank you, sir. You made me smile more often!",2023-10-30 05:54:18,False,True,Samhitha Suresh,,,
