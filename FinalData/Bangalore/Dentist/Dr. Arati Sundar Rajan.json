She even adjusts your treatment as the days pass (if needed) to ensure your issues are taken care off - based on what personally works for you as opposed to a generic treatment that might not necessarily be enough. It's been 3 days since I've been on her treatment and I already feel much better. She is also very considerate about all your follow up questions and concerns. I genuinely thank Practo for connecting me to such an amazing dentist who I'm sure I wouldn't have found if not for this platform. However, my only complaint is with the glitch practo seems to be experiencing.  I fixed the appointment on 18.5.21 thru Practo and also consulted the doctor as scheduled.  But despite consultation Practo app shows the consultation as it never happened and has also refunded my consultation fee.  Something appears to be wrong with Practo app. I do not know whether others also have had the same experience. But I am highly satisfied as the doctor not only stuck to the appointment but also made follow up calls through WhatsApp and video. I 10/10 recommend Dr. Arati for all your dental issues and I can't wait for the pandemic situation to come under control so I can go visit her in person and help me long term. :)",

Dr Arati DID NOT CHARGE FOR HER CONSULTATION AS WELL FOR MY SECOND VISIT THOUGH I MET HER AND SHOWED MY SCANNED REPORT OF MY TEETH AND THE ORAL SURGEON IN HER CLINIC. Not to forget to mention this.. she has taken complete precautions keeping in mind of this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. You will will be completely sanitised from head to toe, your temperature is checked , pulse check is done, you will be given gloves, head cap, foot cap and complete body cover so that you are not infected. I would recommend Dr Arati to anyone who has issues with their dentals. ",

I was very happy to consult with Dr Arati who responded immediately after booking the consultation. She listened patiently, diagnosed and explained the issue to us patiently. She was also available to follow-up to check on my mother's condition, which was a very reassuring experience. Thank you Dr. Aarti.The Practo app however has some issue, where we are unable to mark the consultation as completed, even after few hours. I hope they can fix the same soon.",

In less than a week, the process has started with antibiotics helping get rid of infections and now we've got implants and will soon have good looking, functional teeth! The dental clinic is well-maintained and hygiene is their priority. I would definitely recommend visiting Dr. Aarthi for any tooth issues and rectifications. ",

She then explains the problems in detail and also indicates if there are any problems that may arise in future.Coming to the RCT procedure, it was completely painless. Did not even know when the procedure was over. Highlight is the post follow-up by Dr.Arati. It is really a great gesture which gives comfort and confidence.I would highly recommend Dr. Arati for any of your dental problems and rest assured, you are in the best and safe hands!",

She even adjusts your treatment as the days pass (if needed) to ensure your issues are taken care off - based on what personally works for you as opposed to a generic treatment that might not necessarily be enough. It's been 3 days since I've been on her treatment and I already feel much better. She is also very considerate about all your follow up questions and concerns. I genuinely thank Practo for connecting me to such an amazing dentist who I'm sure I wouldn't have found if not for this platform. However, my only complaint is with the glitch practo seems to be experiencing.  I fixed the appointment on 18.5.21 thru Practo and also consulted the doctor as scheduled.  But despite consultation Practo app shows the consultation as it never happened and has also refunded my consultation fee.  Something appears to be wrong with Practo app. I do not know whether others also have had the same experience. But I am highly satisfied as the doctor not only stuck to the appointment but also made follow up calls through WhatsApp and video. I 10/10 recommend Dr. Arati for all your dental issues and I can't wait for the pandemic situation to come under control so I can go visit her in person and help me long term. :)",

Dr Arati DID NOT CHARGE FOR HER CONSULTATION AS WELL FOR MY SECOND VISIT THOUGH I MET HER AND SHOWED MY SCANNED REPORT OF MY TEETH AND THE ORAL SURGEON IN HER CLINIC. Not to forget to mention this.. she has taken complete precautions keeping in mind of this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. You will will be completely sanitised from head to toe, your temperature is checked , pulse check is done, you will be given gloves, head cap, foot cap and complete body cover so that you are not infected. I would recommend Dr Arati to anyone who has issues with their dentals. ",

In less than a week, the process has started with antibiotics helping get rid of infections and now we've got implants and will soon have good looking, functional teeth! The dental clinic is well-maintained and hygiene is their priority. I would definitely recommend visiting Dr. Aarthi for any tooth issues and rectifications. ",

She then explains the problems in detail and also indicates if there are any problems that may arise in future.Coming to the RCT procedure, it was completely painless. Did not even know when the procedure was over. Highlight is the post follow-up by Dr.Arati. It is really a great gesture which gives comfort and confidence.I would highly recommend Dr. Arati for any of your dental problems and rest assured, you are in the best and safe hands!",

The myth called the treatment is painful was busted. My RCT was done in 15 min..and i still went to office  and finished my day there. \nSo, to summarize I will definitely recommend this doctor and I too would pay regular vist to keep my teeth in good health.\nThank you Dr. Aarthi.",

I checked your mouth and took diagnostic xrays for the problem that u expressed and the other tooth below that was showing a deep dental decay. Even my clinic staff was polite and explained the needful to u. There was an emergency call of a patient that i had to attend when i was explaining to u as that patient had undergone a surgery and needed some clarifications  to be cleared on priority. As per the condition of your tooth i have explained the procedures to u. So i think I was polite and completely explained the treatment in depth. but still it seems strange to me that u were not able to   understand the procedures explained in such depth.",
