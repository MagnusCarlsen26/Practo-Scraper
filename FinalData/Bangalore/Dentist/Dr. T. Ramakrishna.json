But this time, given the severity and condition of my teeth, I had to take a chance. I started my search on practo for a maxillofacial surgeon in Bangalore. And doctor T Ramakrishna came across with highest of positive feedback and now I now why. \ud83d\ude42\n\nComing to treatment: I consulted doctor over wisdom teeth extraction, the one that was very close to a nerve. I must tell you, doctor has done a tremendous job. I am absolutely delighted that I came across this facility, team and doctor. \n\nTeam are kind and supportive. This is my second day after tooth extraction and I can tell that the nerve closer to this tooth is still intact and no damage whatsoever - no numbness \ud83d\ude42.\n\nA big thank you to Doctor, his team and practo. Also, apologies to doctor as I was way too nervous - sorry.  \n\nI highly recommend this doctor. \n\nThanks,\nManjunath",

Although I went there with positive mindset by reading the feedback here, I felt nothing is organized and the concern or care shown was little more and dramatic, not really genuine. I was suggested to get all 4 teeth removed same day and when I go inside for the procedure doctor himself was shocked that x-ray was not taken earlier!! that made me little nervous. and the receptionist does multitasking including taking x-rays, arrange tools and adjust light and suction, etc without using gloves!! I didn't find that really professional at least for the money they charged for very straightforward *** ************** **** ***** *** * **** ******* ** *** *** I had braces in place. No precaution was taken to avoid damage to either braces or gums. As everyone says doctor did his job very confidently and without pain on the spot, *** * *** ******* ******* ** *** ***** ** **** ***** * ******** ***** *** ******** **** ***** * **** ***** ***** *** ********** I thought he would stop but he encouraged me to finish all same day.  For me he didn't explain any procedure or precaution before surgery despite asking. when asked about precaution or post surgery care, receptionist said she will give post surgery. When I asked before should I refrain from brushing, doctor said no need. but after surgery he only suggested not to brush for 2 days!! I got a shock as to why I trusted!! but then as he told earlier with 6 six injections I had painless procedure but had pain for a week which would reduce only with pain killers. Ulcer from the bruise an added and most troublesome pain where I could not talk or eat or smile. When I visited my orthodontist, * *** **** *** ******* *** ******** ****** ** ****** *********** ***** ****** ******** **** **** ******* * ***** *** **** ** **** *** ****** **** ** ******** ***** **** **** ** *********** ** *********** **** ** *** **** ** ***** ***** ** *** ******* I had to visit twice ******* ** **** and guess what The main doctor is not seen after surgery although they always say the main doctor is there!! Why lie? **** **** ** ** ***** ** **** *** ****** ******* ** **** **** ** *** ** ** ***** ****** ** **** ** ******* ******* ** *** ******* ***** During suture removal, the assistant doctor adjusted light with gloved fingers and uses same to remove suture.  I had asked specifically if i had to get someone, but doctor said no need. But I realized such a big mistake I did by accepting that. ** ** ****** ***** * ********** ****** ***** **** **** *** *** ***** ***** *** ** *** ** ** ** ********** ********* ** **** ***** ******* *** ******* *** ** ****** *********** ***** ******* ** ****** **** ***** **** ** *** * *** **** But be assured, as everyone says won't have pain as you will be given enough injections.

Since I have never had any dental issues, I was scared to even meet a dentist! \n\nWhen I realized my wisdom tooth had to be extracted, I was very anxious and had my own inhibitions. After speaking to Dr Ramakrishna, I got the confidence that the procedure will be painless. After reaching there, I got to know that 2 of my wisdom teeth had to be removed! He calmed me down, and within next 5 minutes, he had extracted 2 teeth! When I was just the expecting that the procedure would start, he told the procedure was already over! Frankly speaking, I was very relieved! \n\nHe did give some simple and basic instructions, following which, I have recovered completely! This is my 3rd day after tooth extraction and I'm all well!! In fact, the day my tooth were extracted, within next half an hour I went on Google and was able to write a review, I was in such a good shape! Today, writing a review here! \n\nAll in all, I'm happy I got a doctor that I can trust! \nThank you Doctor Ramakrishna!! ",

But this time, given the severity and condition of my teeth, I had to take a chance. I started my search on practo for a maxillofacial surgeon in Bangalore. And doctor T Ramakrishna came across with highest of positive feedback and now I now why. \ud83d\ude42\n\nComing to treatment: I consulted doctor over wisdom teeth extraction, the one that was very close to a nerve. I must tell you, doctor has done a tremendous job. I am absolutely delighted that I came across this facility, team and doctor. \n\nTeam are kind and supportive. This is my second day after tooth extraction and I can tell that the nerve closer to this tooth is still intact and no damage whatsoever - no numbness \ud83d\ude42.\n\nA big thank you to Doctor, his team and practo. Also, apologies to doctor as I was way too nervous - sorry.  \n\nI highly recommend this doctor. \n\nThanks,\nManjunath",

Although I went there with positive mindset by reading the feedback here, I felt nothing is organized and the concern or care shown was little more and dramatic, not really genuine. I was suggested to get all 4 teeth removed same day and when I go inside for the procedure doctor himself was shocked that x-ray was not taken earlier!! that made me little nervous. and the receptionist does multitasking including taking x-rays, arrange tools and adjust light and suction, etc without using gloves!! I didn't find that really professional at least for the money they charged for very straightforward *** ************** **** ***** *** * **** ******* ** *** *** I had braces in place. No precaution was taken to avoid damage to either braces or gums. As everyone says doctor did his job very confidently and without pain on the spot, *** * *** ******* ******* ** *** ***** ** **** ***** * ******** ***** *** ******** **** ***** * **** ***** ***** *** ********** I thought he would stop but he encouraged me to finish all same day.  For me he didn't explain any procedure or precaution before surgery despite asking. when asked about precaution or post surgery care, receptionist said she will give post surgery. When I asked before should I refrain from brushing, doctor said no need. but after surgery he only suggested not to brush for 2 days!! I got a shock as to why I trusted!! but then as he told earlier with 6 six injections I had painless procedure but had pain for a week which would reduce only with pain killers. Ulcer from the bruise an added and most troublesome pain where I could not talk or eat or smile. When I visited my orthodontist, * *** **** *** ******* *** ******** ****** ** ****** *********** ***** ****** ******** **** **** ******* * ***** *** **** ** **** *** ****** **** ** ******** ***** **** **** ** *********** ** *********** **** ** *** **** ** ***** ***** ** *** ******* I had to visit twice ******* ** **** and guess what The main doctor is not seen after surgery although they always say the main doctor is there!! Why lie? **** **** ** ** ***** ** **** *** ****** ******* ** **** **** ** *** ** ** ***** ****** ** **** ** ******* ******* ** *** ******* ***** During suture removal, the assistant doctor adjusted light with gloved fingers and uses same to remove suture.  I had asked specifically if i had to get someone, but doctor said no need. But I realized such a big mistake I did by accepting that. ** ** ****** ***** * ********** ****** ***** **** **** *** *** ***** ***** *** ** *** ** ** ** ********** ********* ** **** ***** ******* *** ******* *** ** ****** *********** ***** ******* ** ****** **** ***** **** ** *** * *** **** But be assured, as everyone says won't have pain as you will be given enough injections.

Since I have never had any dental issues, I was scared to even meet a dentist! \n\nWhen I realized my wisdom tooth had to be extracted, I was very anxious and had my own inhibitions. After speaking to Dr Ramakrishna, I got the confidence that the procedure will be painless. After reaching there, I got to know that 2 of my wisdom teeth had to be removed! He calmed me down, and within next 5 minutes, he had extracted 2 teeth! When I was just the expecting that the procedure would start, he told the procedure was already over! Frankly speaking, I was very relieved! \n\nHe did give some simple and basic instructions, following which, I have recovered completely! This is my 3rd day after tooth extraction and I'm all well!! In fact, the day my tooth were extracted, within next half an hour I went on Google and was able to write a review, I was in such a good shape! Today, writing a review here! \n\nAll in all, I'm happy I got a doctor that I can trust! \nThank you Doctor Ramakrishna!! ",

Even after asking multiple times, he didn't give a proper budget and everytime went on adding few other procedures. \nThere is no plan of action explained to the patient in written prior to doing any treatment. \nMy father had to go for teeth extraction followed by a bridge. while i asked the doctor for the pricing he mentioned it to be 39k including extraction. My dad and husband also asked him about the pricing and he said the same. Later he charged for the extracted separately and said 39k was excluding the extraction. I'm wondering how can 3 people understand/ hear incorrectly!\n Extracted a tooth and left a part of the tooth inside. when i told the doctor about it, he said that was a bone. do you mean the jaw bone came out?\nEverytime I had to remind him of the procedure that needed to be done as he didn't remember the case each time i went and rather suggested for additional procedures.\nDoctor called for stitch removal and scaling. he removed the stitches and called me the next  day for scaling ( mostly he messed with his appointments and was getting late). Let me tell you I don't have all the time in the world to come to your clinic as and when you call when you cannot manage your own appointments well. I told him i cannot come again and so requested him to finish the scanning which he did then. \nDoctor doesnt't talk to the patient. Might talk to the attender. He instead has an assistant *** ******* **** **** *** ******* \nBills - when you are taking the fees diligently then please also put the same effort to diligently send bills to the patient. Only after I requested for an ebill, was it given to me.\n\nLastly I chose to go to another doctor for rest of treatment *** *** ***** **** *** ********* ******\n\nI have visited him couple of times for my dental issues but this time for my father's treatment it was a very bad experience hence would not recommend.\nI really am not looking forward to any kind of explanation or excuses. \nAll the best!\n",

But when he started the process believe it or not I didn't even feel the pain of Anesthesia also after that everything happened in minutes. I'm really thankful to Dr Ramkrishna for painless tooth extraction process.\n\nThanks\nLohith R",

No unwanted frills, no complications, plain and simple consulting. My wife and I got an RCT and cavity filling done respectively. With the Covid scenario running at the back of our minds, we were initially reluctant visiting a dentist. But Dr. Ramakrishna and his staff are thorough professionals at what they do. I hope more medical practitioners follow such precautions.As for the procedure itself, it hardly took 15 mins. What I really appreciate about the visit is that Dr. Ramakrishna tells you the issue and it's severity and let's us take the final call on the treatment. He never forces his opinions down on the patient, which is rare to find these days.",

But after the procedure which was hardly 5mins we were asked to pay 10000 JUST FOR 2 wisdom tooth saying charges have increased due to corona which was unbelievable.\n\nAnd we were asked to make the payment preferably by googlepay or phonepe as card was not acceptable or had a 2% charge. We have never ever heard of 5000 INR for 1 wisdom tooth **** ** ****** ****** ** ***** **** *** ********* *** ** **** *** ****** *** ****** ** ****** ** **** **** *** **** *****  \n\nWe somehow had to borrow money from our friend and had to pay them for which we havent yet received the bill as well. My first question is what if we were not in a position to pay? Or we couldnt arrange money? **** ** ** ** *** **** *****  I definetly need justification for the amount we had given him today. When this doctor can take time to convince me in removing 2 wisdom tooth at the same time why did he not inform me about the extraction cost. \n\nI agree dr is good with his experience and his procedure is satisfactory.

I researched a lot on the internet to get Maxofacial surgeon and even with reviews I still has doubt. \nSo , I reached out to Dr.Ramakrishna and explained my anxiety and skepticism of wisdom tooth removal. \nI like to educate myself so i asked him all the question. \nHe told me not to Google a lot on complication and scare myself. Indeed, he is right. As patients , we can't act like doctors unless you are one. Trust in your doctor and I did. The procedure lasted 25mins. I was a little scared which is quite natural but Dr.Ramakrishna  finished the procedure and there was absolutely no pain even when anesthesia wore off. It was absolutely meticulous. Be sure to follow the instructions Doctor tells you for 24-72 hours. Cause it's absolutely vital to follow the directions and take meds on time. It was wonderful meeting you doctor and thanks for such painless treatment. Also, reaching out to me every now and then to see if everything is alright. Thanks a ton.\n",

Due to insufficient tooth structure after removing decay  we had advised  you to not to complete the rct instead alternate treatment plan of extraction was adviced .. and through the x-ray we identified decay in the adjacent tooth which was explained to you but u wer not concerned and asked to proceed with the tooth with the issue with root canal and not extraction after that  we  had given a permanent filling and crown for the tooth of concern . We did explain you the reason for the impaction of food on your previous visit . The reason being there was huge space between your tooth previously hence the food had not got impacted where as now as the crown is placed u have food impacted inbetween the crown and natural space ... V had recommended you to get the both crown done in the first appointment itself but because of ur prior choice we had done only the treatment of your choice.  And even during your first visit  v had advised you for the  replacement of both of the crown which u disagreed .",

We employ only qualified doctors .\nOn your scheduled appointment we had consulted you regarding your chief complaint which included pain in your lower  molar region and we did explain you regarding the problem you were facing which is called pericoronitis where the tooth is covered by soft tissue and we did suggest u the treatment plan of removal of the third molar but you were not convinced with the treatment plan and wanted to only remove the soft tissue which was covered \nWe follow ethical practice and want our patient with longer benefits henceforth we recommended you to get the tooth removed and not go for the alternative option which was not an appropriate treatment option . \nThe second option of removing only the soft tissue was going to be beneficial for a minimal period of 1month and we do not compel our patients regarding any treatment hence we explained you the options. And we did listen to your chief complaint and as the issue was diagnosed fully we didn't ask questions which was not necessary for further planning . And as you dint want to undergo the treatment here and wanted to get the treatment done in your native place, we dint want to force you regarding treatment which hope you get our part . We are happy to help you ..if you have still queries on the same.",

He would do an amazing job in minutes and pain fee. I would highly recommend for anyone suffering from tooth issues to visit him for faster recovery.

I had done my x-ray of mouth from a local dental clinic and been informed that a professional oral surgeon is required to extract my wisdom tooth as it was very near the nerve. Initially I consulted Dr. Ramakrishna through video call in which I shared my x-ray with him. He clearly explained me about the issue and procedure, and answered all my questions. During the operation Dr. Ramakrishna was constantly explaining me about the procedure which made me feel relaxed. The overall operation went smooth except in the middle of the operation the electricity in the clinic went off and we had to hold the operation for about 10 minutes. Apart from that everything was fine. Post operation I got my stitches removed after a week and everything seems to be fine now. Thanks to Dr. Ramakrishna and the team. ",

Subsequently, I called him up and shared my x-rays (obtained through local dentist). He very peacefully explained to me and clarified my concerns. \n\nDuring the procedure, he constantly gave me very clear instructions and remained in full control of the situation. His skill and expertise speaks for itself and in less than half an hour, we were done with extraction of both lower and upper teeth. Post-operative care was very nicely explained. I had smooth recovery followed by suture removal. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend Dr. Ramakrishna for his expertise and trust him to do complicated removals. ",

Doctor is really so ************* *** experienced in his field,  he extracted my wisdom tooth so quickly and efficiently with least discomfort.. and though i was an over anxious patient I asked so many questions that he answered without any impatience or irritation... got few other minor procedures also done here at reasonable cost... very friendly and approachable doc...

As parents, seeing your kid undergo a medical procedure (however minor or simple it is) is quite a challenge. But it brings a lot of relief if the kid gets comfortable and stays courageous. What makes the kid comfortable despite the anticipated pain during or post the procedure is how comfortable he / she gets with the Doctor. Kudos to Dr. Ramakrishna for carrying out the entire procedure while comforting my son, keeping him engaged with some songs and making the entire procedure look so simple. Thank you doctor for all your efforts for a smooth execution of the entire procedure. ",

He directly asked me to remove the teeth and told me about my another wisdom teeth in my lower jawline. But he only removed my upper wisdom teeth and told me my lower jawline wisdom teeth is not in bad shape . It doesn't required to remove in present case. Even he didn't apply stitches because of my ulcer infections. I don't have pain within 24 hours of his job. If doctor is wrong can tell me to about lower jawline wisdom teeth extraction also for increasing fees. I was touched with his mankind and will highly recommend the doctor to all other having dental issue.\n\nAll the best to Doctor for his bright mankind practice.",

Even before the wound shrinks,if we make the artificial teeth as you desire, long-term hygiene maintainence will not be good, so adjacent teeth also might undergo decay. We could have done temporary ones immediately  but that comes with more visit and expenses. We don\u2019t give wrong suggestions and waste your time and money .As  you insisted, we could have extracted the tooth and immediately  replace  with artificial ones ,even we can save the valuable time and finish the treatment at the earliest .\nTime is precious for us also. \nEven if you insist I cannot do any kind of treatment which is not recommended by medical science ,\nStill I recommend you to wait for 2-3  weeks and then only get the replacement of the teeth with permanent set.",
