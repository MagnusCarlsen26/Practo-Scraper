,,0,0,NO,I do not recommend this doctor. Surprised to see so many positive reviews. ******* ** *** ************ he caused a wound on the lips but claims its because of antibiotics. Also he needs to learn to write number 5 better. The pharmacist is puzzled to see novomox 120 prescribed and doctor claims he prescribed novomox 500. Never seen such a 5 written in my 43 years of existence.,2022-02-01 00:12:25,False,False,Sabarish Sasidharan,"Me too sir surprised to see your negative review here even after explaining the concern issue. 
Firstly we‚Äôve done a surgical extraction of wisdom tooth for your daughter, it‚Äôs not a simple tooth removal as it is impacted in the bone. That‚Äôs why you need a faciomaxillary surgeon and you approached me. Thank you for that. You would‚Äôve known better if you stayed there during treatment time. We had to call you after surgery and you showed up after 20mins. 
Secondly, It‚Äôs a not WOUND due to instrument mistreatment, it‚Äôs an ulcer which is common in few patients due to antibiotics.
Thirdly, coming to incompetence in my work, no need to explain to you as you‚Äôve already stated 1st line in your review regarding positive feedbacks from our patients. 
Finally, I‚Äôll try to learn writing number 5!!!!",2022-02-02T05:01:32+0000,Dr. Anwar Syed
