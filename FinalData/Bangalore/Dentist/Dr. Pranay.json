The way Dr. Pranay attended, explained and treated my issue, made me switch over to him permanently since that day. ** *** **** ********* ** ******* ********** *** was thoroughly professional,  **** ******** ************* *** **** very polite, approachable and friendly doctor with a lot of patience to resolve all my queries.\nI was someone who has had numerous dental issues before i met Dr. Pranay \nFrom the time I had undergone my orthodontic  treatment during my teens, which was not done too well, I  saw a major deterioration of my teeth at the hands of various dentist who did root canal and re-root canal treatments.\nDr. pranay thoroughly studied my case and then discussed and explained to me in complete detail. He suggested a bite correction and rebuilding treatment with veneers and ceramic caps. I took time to decide on whether I wanted to go ahead and finally after much thought after a year, i went ahead with the treatment  This treatment which was a year long treatment, not only corrected my bite, but also changed my face aesthetically. I was very pleased with the outcome.\nAlso, Dr. pranay was the only dentist who was able to identify my problem of me grinding my teeth at night and provided a solution to it by giving me a night guard plate. \nLast 2years Dr. Pranay is our family dentist attending to my husband, son and also our parents.. He is a very polite  and attends to the minutest details with absolute precision and utmost patience .** ** ****** ******** professional and has a well groomed staff with very high hygiene levels at his clinic.\nMe and my husband trust him completely and feel that we are in safe hands. I would highly recommend Dr Pranay to each person with dental issues. Both Dr Pranay and Dr. Ekta are wonderful people. \nThank you Dr Pranay and Dr. Ekta",

The way Dr. Pranay attended, explained and treated my issue, made me switch over to him permanently since that day. ** *** **** ********* ** ******* ********** *** was thoroughly professional,  **** ******** ************* *** **** very polite, approachable and friendly doctor with a lot of patience to resolve all my queries.\nI was someone who has had numerous dental issues before i met Dr. Pranay \nFrom the time I had undergone my orthodontic  treatment during my teens, which was not done too well, I  saw a major deterioration of my teeth at the hands of various dentist who did root canal and re-root canal treatments.\nDr. pranay thoroughly studied my case and then discussed and explained to me in complete detail. He suggested a bite correction and rebuilding treatment with veneers and ceramic caps. I took time to decide on whether I wanted to go ahead and finally after much thought after a year, i went ahead with the treatment  This treatment which was a year long treatment, not only corrected my bite, but also changed my face aesthetically. I was very pleased with the outcome.\nAlso, Dr. pranay was the only dentist who was able to identify my problem of me grinding my teeth at night and provided a solution to it by giving me a night guard plate. \nLast 2years Dr. Pranay is our family dentist attending to my husband, son and also our parents.. He is a very polite  and attends to the minutest details with absolute precision and utmost patience .** ** ****** ******** professional and has a well groomed staff with very high hygiene levels at his clinic.\nMe and my husband trust him completely and feel that we are in safe hands. I would highly recommend Dr Pranay to each person with dental issues. Both Dr Pranay and Dr. Ekta are wonderful people. \nThank you Dr Pranay and Dr. Ekta",

From the initial consultation to the final procedure, Dr. Pranay and his team provided exceptional care and expertise.\n\nDr. Pranay's professionalism and attention to detail instilled confidence in me from the start. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, addressing all my concerns and ensuring I felt comfortable every step of the way.\n\nThe actual implant procedure was surprisingly smooth and virtually pain-free, thanks to Dr. Pranay's skillful hands and state-of-the-art equipment. The Osstem implant he recommended has proven to be a fantastic choice, providing me with natural-looking and sturdy replacement teeth.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Pranay apart is his genuine concern for his patients' well-being. He followed up with me post-procedure to ensure everything was healing properly, and his genuine care made all the difference in my recovery process.\n\nI cannot recommend Dr. Pranay's dental clinic enough to anyone seeking top-notch dental care in Bangalore. If you're in need of dental implants or any other dental procedure, look no further than Dr. Pranay's clinic. You won't be disappointed.",

After visiting several doctors, someone suggested me to visit Dr. Pranay\nIn the very first meeting we formed a connection and she calmed me down and understood my fear. \n\nAfter some grueling extractions and 7 yrs later he is still my dentist and I have to visit her everytime I visit Bangalore\n\nEven today I am waiting for my next visit pandemic to visit Bangalore to get my treatment done from him because I know I am in the right hands and he will go beyond her duties like always to help me overcome my fear and bare the pain.\n\nI am nothing but extremely grateful to him for holding my hands when I needed the most.

Dr PRANAY & his team were very friendly since the start and made sure I was comfortable during the entire process. He explained the existing issues very well in simple terms and also the possible next steps towards resolving it. He never at any point of time seems to be pushing me for dental treatment just for the sake of doing it. He listened to my concerns and addressed them in a professional manner. Got my CBCT reports done. Later based on the tests and dental x-rays, he recommended Dental Implants.  I then had some scans of my upper and lower jaw taken. They were always available at convenient timings during weekends, considering my hectic work schedule.\n\nThe implants were placed in a single sitting with the latest advanced technology, moreover a painless treatment. The final result of the crown implant is an exact match with my other teeth, which was something I was worried about at the beginning, however the result is outstanding! It has also resulted in my teeth being more aligned than what it was before. Smilecure is very hygienic and well organized.\n\nThe entire team is the best qualified, friendly and hard working doctors",

Dr pranay has been very careful and dexterous about cleaning/polishing my sensitive teeth and suggesting good tips to keep teeth in good shape . Highly recommended clinic!!      1st review---I had gone for routine checkup/cleaning of teeth. Had very informative discussion and couple of cleaning sessions by Dr. Pranay. Very carefully done and painless sessions. Other medical setup, ambience and personal care by staff is worth appreciating.\n\n3rd Review--\nI revisited clinic on 26th Aug'21. Dr. Pranay has done filling for 4 teeth. Experience is always fantastic. Doctor is very caring, systematic and very professional in handling patient and advising on various aspects of dental health. It was a very painless experience of dental fillings. She exhibited highly professional work, Very courteous support staff and a great clinic ambience. Thank You!!",

However, waiting is worth it as well cause he patiently handles and listens to every patient. \n\nMy condition was Little complicated, My wisdom teeth was hurting partially my  lower jaw and nerves and also due to this, the tooth before has formed a cavity. \n\nI went for Wisdom Teeth removal. Generally it is considered to be a painful surgery but when Dr.Pranay & Dr.Ekta both did this very much perfectly and Less painful than what I heard from others.All the instructions were given. Post Treatment procedure is also very much appreciated.  \n\nalso, Root Canal Treatment (RCT ) was performed by Dr.Ekta after 2 weeks of healing and completed in 2 sittings.\n\noverall - she is an excellent doctor for Root Canal, and wisdom teeth removal charges were nominal when I asked my other friends too.and treatment is done most in a good manner as  i have visited a couple of doctors before.\n\nHope my Review will be helpful to all, have a great day.",

I went through multiple dentist and finally I was referred by my friend about Dr. Pranay. He examined my teeth and took digital X-ray and found my wisdom tooth was horizontal coming out and due to that my right lower teeth was attack by cavity. He advised me for scaling of my teeth, RCT of right lower teeth '7' and removal of lower left wisdom teeth. First I went for scaling of my teeth and post scaling I found bleeding of my gums stopped and bad breath issue was resolved. And the RCT was done in just 3 sittings. And removal of lower left tooth was done my surgical. I was afraid of RCT and Removal of wisdom tooth but here it went really smooth and painless. Post RCT, ceramic crown was fixed and now I do not have any oral problem.\nAlso my brother had uneven tooth so we had to use braces for his tooth. Braces installation was very smooth and regular visit for adjustment was also arranged in timing manner.\nCost : Compared to other clinics is very minimum.\nPre and Post treatment briefing was very clear so there is no fear of treatment. \nAmbience : parking available, hygiene is very well maintained. \nI strongly recommend Dr.Pranay for any dental treatments.

This is by far one of the most organized and well managed services I have ever experienced. The Clinic is located near kadubeesenhalli Circle, which makes it really convenient. It is so well managed, that it hardly feels like you are visiting your Dentist, but instead a High End clinic with portable xray .and you know you\u2019re in really good hands).The best part is that you always get a reminder text and an email a day prior to your visit to confirm the appointment, and a call on the day of the visit to ensure there are no delays from either sides. All of the equipment used for the dental procedures are well sanitized. The Doctors here are extremely polite and very well experienced and are more than happy to help you. They even provide a kit and a demo when you get your braces, and assist you throughout the whole journey wherever necessary. The only negative part about the whole experience was the traffic on the link road post 6:30pm. But overall it was worth it. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are a teen, or a working individual, if Quality and Value for price is what you\u2019re looking for, then I\u2019d strongly recommend this place.",

I saw that doctor was taking the appointment serious and he also called us before time to make sure that we reach in time , he also guided us the way. he started the treatment by first enquiring about the previous history and then listen patiently all about it then he did the RCT and it was completely painless I was surprised that this treatment can be done without pain. I was also taken care and he was asking about my comfortablity every session. The RCT was done by my previous doctor was failed and he took the x-ray and explained about everything. I also was allowed to choose my subsequent appointment and then I took in the evening. I can say from my experience that doctor and the treatment is as per standards he is friendly and explains the problem in a easy and fun manner. I was sure about his ability after speaking with him. I recommend him to my friends and people who are looking for a good dental doctor.",

Amid the primary arrangement he had approached me what prescriptions I'm taking for Diabetes in which a wrong medication was recommended and he rectified it.And he talks about the dental issue very unmistakably before treatment is begun. Already I had met 3 dental specialists and all the three had panicked me tor complete medical procedure and none of them enlightened me concerning the wrong medicine I was taking for diabetes. Subsequent to meeting Sir without medical procedure he has restored me of my gum problems with his own consideration by playing out the different Procedures and I was mended with in 3 days. What's more, presently I don't have any such issue and I'm cheerful and my teeth are typical and I'm content with the doctor,staff and the atmosphere of the center. ** *** ** *** **** ******** clean center which I've visited among the 4. There are no words to clarify how upbeat I am and I think he has got great enchantment in his grasp which I never anticipated. It's a supernatural occurrence by the finesse of god and specialist. I express gratitude toward him such in all seriousness family. With high respects and due appreciation to the specialist for his understanding and conduct and his temperament to oblige and participate. Extraordinary neighborliness and everyone is extremely kind. I exceptionally suggest smilecure dental clinic for any dental issue and I by and by say thanks to Doctor Sir with high respects.

I got a call at 6:00pm asking me to come early and be available at 7:00. i obliged and was at the clinic at 7:00. to my surprise, Dr.Pranay was not in the clinic and a trainee dentist attended me. While my problem was bad breath, i was asked to do grating and filling. The dentist attending me didnt know where the captivities were and i was guiding them. all the while, it was not the trainee who was deciding what procedure to be done, it was an old man sitting in the clinic who was calling the shots. I was made to realize he was Pranay's dad. This old man was insisting me to go for a RCT, which i declined and the whole atmosphere changed. the old man spoke to the dentist separately and my filling was done within seconds. I have my doubts on the quality of filling done \r\n\r\nto make matter worse, i was asked to sing a undertaking, that i take all the responsibility of filling falling off as i didnt agree for the RCT. \r\n\r\nWhile the world is moving to credit card payment, i fail to understand, why do these people charge 2% extra for card payment. The charges were 2500/- for the service, which i feel is a utter waste.\r\n\r\nI bad breath is still a problem, with no improvement. god save their patients.",

I recollected my memories and I feel myself proud to see the young and honest doctor because I saw Dr. Pranay when he was 15 yrs old and now when I visited to him he recognise me very quickly. His way of approach towards patient and senior citizens is very nyc . his way of talking is Vry appreciable. He follows Vry Gud discipline in the way of approach to patients. He has examined all my teeth. After that he has done scaling of my teeth. Now I Dnt feel any bad breath. Then he has done two premolar rct in single sitting only. After that he has advised me for lava 3m crown to improve my aesthetics. Comparing to other clinic his charges is too much low.  Being defense person I will certainly recommend Dr. Pranay for excellent treatment. Now I feel better and more comfortable eating and talking. He is really hard worker and honest dentist. Dr. Pranay explained me the complete treatment procedure before starting treatment step by step. I m Vry happy with my look. I would suggest to visit his clinic for everybody. Giving 5 out of 5",

Dr. Pranay does the entire procedure very patiently , controlling pain to a large extent unlike some dentists who are just behind completing the procedure without understanding patients sensitivity.  The other aspect which I really appreciate is that Dr. Pranay shares all details regarding treatment with his patients so that patients understand the reasons behind their teeth problems and the line of treatment.  I will highly recommend Dr. Pranay for any kind of dental treatment. ",

I was not able to find any doctor at that time and was really worried as I tried so many pain killers but none of them were effective against the pain. I could hardly do any talking with anyone from past days.\nI was lucky to find and book your appointment via practo as it gave me the opportunity to consult with you over the chat and I saw that you were very responsive and patient. My mom was really worried and she also conveyed her regards to you. I was not feeling any pain after you performed the sedation and I was surprised on myself if I would be able to take the teeth out without crying because I am very sensitive to pain and can't bear it . After the impaction of my teeth I followed your advice and did not spit it out anything. I see that my pain is going down and I could atleast eat the liquid foods without any issue. Thanks doctor.",

I was having lot of troubles in eating and chewing anything. I was very scared that i might have to take the tooth out since this was the only option we listened when i was a kid. I can say that you and your way of handling a patient is really  comfortable and painless. I did not feel any stress and issue during the treatment. I noticed that you were very friendly and convincing in your talks. The lower teeth on the left side was having very bad state of infection, i was not even able to brush my teeth that side, however the mouthwash you gave me actually gave lot of relief and its better now. Thanks a lot doctor and your team.",

The procedure would have been \u00a3450 in the UK.  * **** *** *** **** **** ***** *** *******  I liked them so much I came back the next day for laser teeth whitening.\n\n Pricing is fantastic and the quality is the same as a UK Harley Street Clinic.  I\u2019ll return next year for a full set of 8 composite Veneers.  The quoted price was a little over \u00a31000.  This would be \u00a34,500 to \u00a36,000 in the UK.  \n\nThis is a dental surgery that you can trust",

He did my Xray and confirmed that my teeth is broken and have to undergo Root canal to save teeth. He did all the procedures delicately and I had the wonderful treatment experience. I believe he is one of the best dental doctor available in the marathalli area. Any one can walk in to his clinic anytime.  ",

I am fortunate that my former dentist in the USA was excellent, but I have to say, the care I received at smilecure was superior to any dental treatment I have ever had.  All details were seen to with rigorous care, whether they be explaining the whys and how's of the process, attending to pain management, or even the exacting match of the new crowns to the shade of my teeth.  Root canals are never fun to receive, and I hope to not need any more. However, I know that if I did need one again in the future I will receive the best care at smilecure.",

He then asked me if I want a tooth removal as that would be the best option otherwise my tooth would infect others as well. I took my time and went to the clinic a week later. Surprisingly he remembered and asked me about the pain I was having. Hearing this I realized that he really care for his patients. I told him that I am ready for the extraction and he did the same. I am so happy with the care I was taken care. It's been 2 months now and I feel great. Thanks to dr.pranay and his team and staff",

Due to work constraints I was only able to visit India for 13 days.  Dr. Pranay and his team did an excellent job working with that time frame.  \n\nDr. Pranay is very thorough in his work and I am confident that I could not have received better treatment in USA. I ended up needing multiple crowns and veneers for my front teeth that completely revamped my smile. The result\u2026 a beautiful, very natural looking smile that I am proud to show off at every opportunity!  I could not be happier with the results and would highly recommend Dr. Pranay to anyone considering dental tourism.",

Before visiting smilecure I went to another dentist who was trying to get me to purchase rs 95000 worth of dental work to \"fix\" my teeth.\n When I got a second opinion from Dr. Pranay,I was happy and relieved to find that he was a straight forward and honest guy. \nHe was not going to make me get thousands of rupees of work that I didn't really need. We worked together to come to a solution that was MUCH more cost effective for me and my teeth looks absolutely amazing!!!! \nI am very happy with smilecure Dental and would recommend them to anyone who wants honestly, professionalism, and high quality service.",

I loved his  friendly nature. \n\nRecently when I visited I had a week of time only and partial root canal, deep cleaning, crown, 3-4 fillings had to be done.Dr Pranay was quick and conveniently adjusted my sittings to finish up all the things quickly. \n\nI would definitely recommend people to come to this place for dental treatment.",

Now I turned recently to 71 years and it was my luck, I changed the dentist! I suffered on a serious periodontitis through all my life. Many dentists treated me and I was almost traumatized just to see a dentist. With this background I was recommended to Dr. Pranay.But mostly I loved his honesty, he did not promise the result, because it was a risky treatment including bone augmentation and implants. My German dentists did not want to take the risk. His profound professionalism and power let me start to trust. And he made it! Now after2 years I am still looking great with beautiful implants, and ceramic crwons free of pain and lot of gratitude to this unbelievable woman.",

But i feel should give much attention spending some minutes to examine and listen to the background of the pain, and more details like whether any root canal had done, any allergies if the patient is having and how long the pain is there many more. He just started without asking or discussing anything, which made me feel like worried about and uneasy. Also after the process he should have good checklist of dos and don'ts. Some his assistant explained while some I had to ask like should I use mouth wash or not which he mentioned no... \n\nOverall he seems to be good Dentist, but if he improves in customer focus then will be good.",

I also love their friendly reminders of my appointment date and time - very efficient communication. These kinds of services are usually found in only selected cities - we are so lucky to have it here in bangalore!",

My visit to Smile Cure  Multi  Speciality  Dental   Clinic was a result of good reviews on Google and practo. I received first hand information about Dr   Pranay  through his comprehensive website. During my treatment I could feel the difference between a doctor and a specialised doctor and Dr  Pranay  was exceptionally good in root canal treatment. My bridge was delivered after a thorough trial and only after I approved the color and shape.\r His  Pre  and  Post Treatment  Briefing  will  clear  ur  all  problems  .  He  is  a   Dentist   who  work   very  honestly and  Patient  gives  him respect  too  much  .   U  can  openn his  feed back  and read    U  will  not  found  any  bad   personal remarks   on  his   treatment  in  Practo  or   Just  dial  or  google  but  if  u  read  other   Dentist  feed  back  U  will  read  Patient Negative  remarks  in  red  colour  in  thumbs  down  .    If  a  Dentist  have  less  than   4  star  Rating    must  read  his  Negative  feed  back  in  Practo  as  well as   Just  dial  also  .   Be  carefull from  that  Dentist  ,   I  got  cheated  by  those  famouse  Dentist  who  charge  less  amount  for  my  root canal   treatment  and  crown  and his   Root  canal treatment  is  worst  and  crown  was   made  in  his   local  Lab  which  was broken.\n \rI take pleasure in recommending  Smile  Cure  Multi  Speciality  Dental   Clinic to everyone in search of good dentist.",

It was a lifetime memory for me. Dr pranay is very clear on any treatment ,",

During the surgery I was nervous in regards to pain but they gently removed the tooth without any pain and surgery was completed within 15mins & after surgery they gave a proper prescription list to be followed after surgery and following to that post recovery was very fast.\n\nDr.pranay clinic is very hygienic and is maintaining . I will highly recommend them for any dental issues.",

They maintain good hygiene and dental staff is prompt in understanding patient needs. I had done dental braces treatment from here and it was absolutely taken care. All the Orthodontists were good and I was given consultation with at least 3 orthodontists to understand dental braces and choose. Special thanks to Dr Ekta for extracting my teeth with less pain.",

Though there was no continuous pain he advised about tooth decay and root canal requirement which was driving up my sugar. To my surprise 3 days after my root canal during my weekly home check the count was back to normal (85/148).  I recommend periodic check. Also visit Dr pranay for painfree root canal and courteous service. The precision, speed, meticulous and pain staking diagnosis is to be experienced before it can become a belief",

I went to meet him and told the doctor to extract the tooth. He suggested me to go for RCT once again because the tooth was intact and good. * **** *** ** ** **** ******* ** **** ** a good human being. Now after one month of my complete RCT treatment I am feeling like there was no problem in my tooth. For the alignment I decided to for the novalign invisible braces.

I was supposed to undergo root canal which he started immediately and thank god i was relived of pain.\nI must appreciate as no one was open at that point of time.\nThe entire root canal process and cap placement was finished within a span of 7days.\nI had spaces also between my teeth for which i am getting them closed using the clear invisible braces.

Through the years, in addition to the implants, I\u2019ve had many regular checkups, fillings, a few root canals, even veneers and teeth whitening!  All done professionally, hygienically and at a great value (compared to the rip off charges from the US dental industry). I\u2019m so glad my career allows me the flexibility to leverage this professional dentistry.  I highly recommend! thank you smilecure dental clinic thanks",

I have already recommended many of my friends to him who came back satisfied, and would recommend further strongly to visit him for the same experience.",

I was experiencing a lot of pain during my consultation and the days that followed and Dr. Pranay was able to see me weeks before my scheduled procedure to help alleviate the pain until he saw me again. That was a complete life saver for me!! I appreciate him for making me feel comfortable with the procedure, keeping me in the loop with exactly what was to happen. I can't thank you all enough! I highly recommend Dr. Pranay, hands down!",

He told me that now it needs a repeat root canal which you can get it from your previous dentist free of cost, no need to spend more here. This one point clearly stated me that this doctor is not running after money and is honest with his diagnosis.\n\nI spoke to my old dentist regarding this and mailed him x-ray also but he didn't respond at all. I continued to have pain and when it became unbearable, I went back to Dr. Pranay. He did the root canal without causing me pain and my pain went off in just 30min. He gave discount as well, because I've already spent so much on that tooth.\n\nHe is the first dentist I have seen in my life who wanted to save patients money. Unlike other dentists who not only do mistakes in treatment but charge huge. Dr. Pranay is an example to all dentists.",

The progress has been tremendous and I am still visiting him for regular check ups. The behavior of all the doctors and staff is really cordial and they will make you feel very comfortable. I am completely satisfied with my experience here and would recommend the clinic to one and all.\n\nSpecial mention here for Dr. Ekta as well for her ever charming and super sweet ways of dealing with patients. She always made sure to motivate me during any treatment and also did regular follow up calls to check on the progress and issues. It's always a good experience to interact with you mam.\n\nA big thank you to Dr.ekta and Dr.Pranay and applauds for the great job you both are doing :)",

I would say they don't have required instruments and it's better to go to clinic or hospitals which have better equipments  to identify the issue and operate better for such process.",

As i was not satisfied with his explanation i went to smilecure for dental checkup.They only did cleaning at nominal charges without any pain and i am very much satisfied with their treatment. I love the docs there, the way they treat their patients with lots and lots of advices. They are great at their work. i would recommend them to everyone with dental issues. ",

Then he advised me for deep scaling and gum treament. After scaling and gum treatment I am not feeling any more sensitivity. I mainly choose this clinic because of positive recommendation from few other folks who live in my community in Bangalore and the fact that it is in kadubeesanahalli where I stay. Dr Pranay was indeed Vry Gud professional and did the cleaning and gum treatment in a timely and efficient manner. He also had good suggestions on dental hygiene and better upkeep for me. The dental instrument and machinery at the clinic seemed quite advance. I would recommend the clinic and specially Dr. Pranay to my family and friends. Thanks Dr. ",

On next sitting I am sure my daughter would be more cooperative as she already has confidence that this person is not going to hurt her. When ever she got slight pain, he stopped, and started only after she allowed to start procedure. Very much satisfied and recommend Pranay for your kid's dental problems.",

When I went in, the doctor was already he quickly took my case history and went about his job in a very calm and soothing manner, explaining each step in detail (sometimes a tad too much detail for a non-BDS person I suppose, but he was nice enough to explain what I didn't understand in one go). I've faced multiple dentists in my life, for such is my history when it comes to dental care. Dr. pranay is most definitely one of the best I have come across and his facility is also well equipped.

Why I am writing this is coz I also went there after reading some good reviews and then obviously I applied my mind during my first consulation visit. And I concluded that I shall get all my Dental treatment from Dr pranay team. I was comfortable from day one, I mean medically as well as financially coz I was told exact amount clearly. I opted everything best in terms of brand as well as warranty,thereby to ensure peace of mind now onwards. \n\n\n",

That place seemed so old and and was not very happy with the fact that within a minute all my treatments were chalked out. So I gave up initially and then another bit of my tooth cracked which is when I got a little worried. Found Dr. Pranay  by location on practo and called him immediately and it was almost instant that I felt rather comfortable. I asked him if i could ask him two questions and then went on to ask another one at which point  he reminded me jovially that this was my third question.. So it started out quite well and when I went in for the appointment  he took his  time understanding my concerns and the fact that although I wanted this done I also wanted to be a little comfortable with the entire plan. He mentioned that I needed quite a few cavities filled , one  Root Canal Treatment  and in between I had got into the the habit of chewing pan masala which had also stained my teeth and that needed to be taken care off as well an more. My Root Canal Treatment done very nicely  , now I  did not have any pain\rin my second molar and ceramic crown was placed .  Even I can not identify  it  is  natural tooth  or artificial .  Thanks Dr Pranay and his team for nice treatment . Highly Recommended for  Dental Treatment  .\n",

I was visiting my son in Bangalore   and developed some pain again. I went to  Smile Cure  Multi Speciality Dental Clinic  and consulted Dr. Pranay . He saw my case and suggested that we should go in for a bridge quickly. I told him that I have already been advised an implant. He guided me very well and said that an implant should always be preferred only if 90% of factors are favorable. If any additional surgery is required for giving an implants, but bridge could be given without any surgical intervention, then bridge is advised .  Previous Dr  made  PFM  Bridges which came out   four days ago  .  Best treatment  is   Second  pre molar and  third molar  RCT will  be done  and  bridge will be made  so  there will  be  no  risk in future   . I started  rct  and  the bridge treatment and was very satisfied with the final outcome. I was very happy to meet a dentist who places the patients interest foremost. Thanks Dr. Pranay , I would recommend my known people in   Hyderabad   also to visit you, if some long & expensive treatments are required.",

I then visited Dr.  Pranay  for consultation, he is very friendly, dedicated  and polite, did answer all my questions and gave appropriate suggestions as expected. So I agreed to go for   Scaling and  re-RCT and cover them with  Ceramic crowns crowns to prevent breakage and other problems.\rI asked him  about  my  gum treatment.  Dr Pranay told me   I  have  done  deep scaling that is enough for  your gum if  gum treatment will require then only  I  recommended  otherwise  normal scaling is  very good .\n\rBetween I did a lot of research on the root canal treatment, placing dental crowns and found my treatment was excellent and also found my doctor did take all precautions during treatment\r\n\rAbout Dr.  Pranay : highly professional at work, he will not prescribe something just unless it is necessary. He made the procedure smoothly and I felt no pain or fear during treatment. I would recommend Dr  Pranay  over any other dentist more .",

I became hopeless when I was told by a couple of dentists  of  corporate  and   big  clinics  that I have to let go my tooth  and    plan   for  Implant . Finally a  relative suggested to consult with Dr  Pranay . I decided to try to give it a shot and found that not even once did he talk about extracting the tooth. His focus seemed to be on saving the tooth - seems like he gives the best and honest advice. I had a very good impression in the first meeting itself. Since then there is no stopping, no words to thank him for the level of comfort he has been delivering to his patients.The root canal was completely painless,  ,wisdom tooth   extraction   was   nice  ,  it  is  not  created  any  fear  in my mind , the bridge is functioning very well.   I  saved  a  lot  of  time  and  money  and  simultaneously teeth  also            I really didn't even dream of it. I wonder what would have happened had I gone to another dentist and lost my tooth. Can only say TONS OF THANKS to him  and  for  his team ..\r\n",

And hand skills are too too good. I  got my  scaling ,  Painless  Root  Canal Treatment  , Veneers  and  Ceramic crownnand Bridges  .     Example    normal  standard  company  ceramic  is  6500   but    in  Sakara  , vims  , Manipal , Vasan , Indira Nagar ,  M G  Road  HS R Lay out  Kormangala  it  will  cost  more  than  RS  10000   and   sometimes  U will  get  duplicate    Crowns  also .  Therefore  being  educated  person do not  get  cheated  by   any  one .  Decide your self for  good  dentist   and  get   right  treatment .  Do  not go  beauty  of  clinic   see  the  beauty of  good  treatment  .  U  are  the best judge   after  takig  treatment  He is going to be my life time dentist for sure.",

Thereafter, he painstakingly explains the cause and effect of the problem and how he intends to go about solving the problem. With the use of the latest world class gadgets and latest slides  in his laptop  in his Dental Clinic, which he justifiably calls \"Dental Spa\", he methodically shows to the patients the exact condition of their teeth and gums and explains how he intends curing the ailment as also the cost involved. With such transparency and approach, one can't help but admire him. \rMy experience with Doctor  Pranay  was really pleasant. He was not only attentive while I gave him brief history of my dental issue but on inspecting my teeth ( rather decay in my tooth ) he even clearly explained the root cause of the problem and steps or procedures that he would take to address the issue. My  Root  Canal Treatment  was  Painless  and Ceramic  Crown  is also first class quality . \r\nMay be because of his   Air  Force  background, he is not money minded and is all about providing the best service to grieving patients like me. He is extremely knowledgeable and diligent in his profession.  He is not rudely  even u are  wrong  very  polite way he will convince  u .I would surely recommend him to any person suffering from dental issue or even for regular dental check\n",

He had thise typical bunny teeth for the 2 front teeth. One of my family friends suggested that this was the right age to start wearing braces so that by the time my brother finishes off his school, his teeth would be all set. Not being into dental check-ups, we had a few consultations done before finally agreeing to the idea of getting braces. We were actually looking for a quick but lasting solution. After a long research on braces and opinions from various friends and family members, we decided to go with  Smile Cure Multi Speciality Dental Clinic  for the procedure (since this spans over years, it was necessary to have a good doctor in beginning itself). We have our friends and family to thank, and now that we have a platform, even the doctor to thank, the way this entire procedure will take  care off over a period of  11 to 12 months .. My brother has now got a complete smile makeover done. He also got a couple of fill more.. Thanks DR Pranay and nice  TEAM .",

After numerous visits the pain still didn't go away. Frustrated and almost decided on getting it removed, I thought of looking for another option online just for a  3 rd opinion. And thank God I found Dr.  Pranay  here on Practo. He gave me a new day of hope and assured me of giving the totally gone tooth a genuine go. And now and behold, here I am exactly 30 days  later with my tooth completely sorted, the pain totally gone, the RCT properly completed and a new metal-free all-ceramic crown also in place. The crown fits beautifully too and matches very well with the rest of my teeth. I dare say the previous doctor at the \"big, famous\" clinic I first went, in spite of being so senior and reputed, probably wanted to make more money by convincing me to do dental implants rather than making any genuine attempt to save my tooth. But, Dr.  Pranay  was a real hone more..",

I booked an appointment  with Dr Pranay  When I reached there I saw a lot of people already waiting in queue. The clinic was very well maintained, neat and clean. My consultation was done sharp as per the appointment. When i went for consultation, I found the doctor to be very humble. He has done deep cleaning of my teeth  now my teeth like milk colour after that gum  treatment was done  it was gum surgery ,  some small  decay was filled . The way he found out the issue and the way he handled my queries I was totally impressed. I truly did feel that what he mentions in his profile here: treat human beings and not patients, is what he really follows. I am currently taking the medicines and already see a reduction in pain and no bad breath feeling , written  hexidine anti septic mouth wash . He taught me how to use mouth wash which  90 %  patients do not  Know .

The very thought of going to a dentist scares me.That's why perhaps I was ignoring the lingering pain in my tooth. Finally after hearing numerous 30 seconds of Dr.  Pranay's painless dentistry, I mustered the courage to go and meet him.\r\nI underwent a Painless  Rotary  Root Canal treatment and post and core  with him. It was a like a walk in the park,compared to the Root Canal I had undergone earlier. Right from the lovely clinic its wonderful ambience to the actual treatment, it was a dream. There was actually no pain.\r\nHe used  modern  technology, Even the anesthesia given by him was just a liquid which he applied and in just 2 or 3 seconds,that area went numb. Earlier,the dentist would give an injection to give anesthesia and then I would have to wait for 15 to 20 minutes for the area to be numb.\r\nDr  Pranay  I truly admire your medical and soft skills. I really liked the way you explained to me everything in detail, when I was on the chair. so it was a wonderful e more..",

His team was also around for a quick chat and I quite enjoyed the little dialogue we had in context to all my dental needs., after doing deep  scalling all calculus  , cement like fod was remooved , all decays were filled very nicely  . now  my teeth are  looking white  , after looking in mirror  I have  100  % faith  in  Dr  Pranay .   I do not have teeth sensitiviti to Hot  or  Cold  and all 04 fillings were also done  therefore  no decay is visiable  . I got my perfect smile back .  Some missing teeth treatment left , The doctors accept payment via cards which was a big surprise to me since most doctors only take cash.  He  was also quick to schedule a followup meeting for next week where in we can look at more advanced options for my dental health. I am scheduled for this Saturday and will post more details then.\r\nCost of cleaning and polishing of teeth  start from 700 - 1500. Appointment only. Minimal waiting time.",

Today we may find a doctor professionally very well qualified and efficient but its rare to find a one who understands patient's psyche and needs . I felt extremely blessed when i noticed that Dr.  Pranay  is among those rare ones. He almost gives a personalized dental treatment understanding the patients situation and need. His work ethics are non-compromised ,punctuality in keeping appointments , cleanliness at clinic are excellent.   His Treatment is Systematic as per patient  Requirement . After  Scalng my teeth  was  looking like milk colour  and  one composite filling  done , I got  Root Canal Tretment done  .  I got my ceramic crown  then  I  requested him for  Ceramic Braces He has never imposed any choice about a particular filling or dental cap on me. He has always explained the finances involved and material and its utility very much clearly to me. He has taken prompt and apt decisions for root canal or cavity filling  , Ceramic Braces and were always satisfactory. \n",

One thing that I noticed is that he gives proper time to each and every patient in his clinic. I  got root canal treatment in my  home town  but Dr did not put more pressure to put the cap  now my teeth is fractured . He explains   the entire treatment plan in detail along with the time  needed to complete the treatment and cost. Also I find that the prices here are very reasonable as I have consulted other clinics also for dental implants. Clinic ambience is nice and it's clean and well maintained. Initially I was little apprehensive for dental implants as I heard it's a invasive procedure but after meeting sir I immediately got it done and I got my smile back as it was my front teeth. Now I can say putting a implant is not at all painful. Thanks to sir and his wonderful team who took great care of me not just during the treatment but afterwards also. Definitely recommend dr  Pranay to anyone I need of dental treatment of any kind.  After treatment  no patient can forget him or his team .",

I must say he is one doctor who works with passion.  He treats her patients like friends and treats them in a very gentle and fragile way.  He gives proper briefing step by step regarding any starting treatment .I had a lot of work shift issues but  he managed to give me that time inspite of his busy schedule. I have proudly spoke about his to all my friends and family. After going to him I would never go to any other dentist. I have to travel total 01  hours to reach his clinic but its worth it. I wish him all the best in what he does as what he does is just AWESOME. If anybody needs a dentist its rhim .  He knows when to be assertive, when to be gentle and at the end of it give you marvellous results at a very economic price.  He and his team  are just amazing people. ALL THE BEST Dr.  Pranay  God will bless you abundantly for the work that you do. Stay blessed.",

I realised it when things went out of my hand for my tooth ache. My visits made me realise my mistakes overtime and my delay to visit dentists. To praise here for Dr  Pranay he never made any scaring comments. Though he made me realize the urgency involved in surgery of my wisdom tooth removal and consequences of my missing tooth, but all the time there was a tone that whatever happens he as a dentist will handle it and ensured me that all my pains belongs to him now. It was a great boost to me with caring words arriving to me during trouble. On the day of surgery I was too nervous and only to realise that surgeon who performs it was equally supportive and competent. Later on I went with tooth replacements and what not. In last it was easy,very easy to get it done. Just coz of behavior of doctors at Smile Cure Multi Speciality Dental Clinic. I thank them all for taking me out of pain ordeal. . thanks Dr Pranay and  His Team .",

The extraction was done and it was painless.  The implants were placed and we were told to visit after 3 months for cap placement. We visited the Doctor after 3 months and the cap fabrication was started. The caps were fixed and we are very happy with the treatment.  My father has no problems with chewing he is able to eat comfortably everything.\nThe teeth which are fixed are fixed are natural looking.\n I would definitely recommend Dr Pranay for replacement of teeth as he did a wonderful job.

My treatment is nearing completion and the changes to my teeth are very noticeable already. It has been worth it. Thanks to Dr. Pranay and his wonderful team. Dr. Pranay has treated my problem in a very efficient manner. Definitely recommend this clinic for braces treatment",

I had booked my slot via call but I reached earlier,  doctor  pranaywas kind enough to accommodate me since he was unoccupied that time. he let me know cost of cleaning based on stains of my teeth, which was reasonable. At the time of cleaning I was surprised to see Doctor's patience. Patient needs to throw water which accumulates in the process of cleaning which hinders the pace of cleaning. he was never irked. Even while cleaning patient has to widen the gap between teeth even if patient tends to reduce it I found him very polite in asking her patient to widen it. In a process of 40 to 45 mins of cleaning I found him asking me to widen it almost 20 times politely which was very pleasing.Also hygiene of the place is ultimate. he cleaned my teeth thoroughly and I am very happy at outcome of it. I will rate 5 out of 5 and would recommend anyone to visit this place if you are looking for a Dentist. Thanks Doctor",

I was actually taken care like a kid, bcoz I was behaving like one not letting him start the initial treatment peacefully. After all the time spent getting clicked in most funny ways finally I am happy with  RCT and my crowns which are as real. Overall an awesome experience.

While searching for dentists I read about Dr pranay and thought of calling the clinic while saving the number by mistake the call got connected which I cancelled later on but got a call back from the dr pranay regarding he received a call from my number\u2026 this is worth mentioning because as in today one rarely calls back to unknown numbers. I booked my appointment and immediately all the details of the clinic was shared which was quite helpful for me to reach on time\u2026 Dr pranay makes the entire procedure very comfortable and informs all the steps before in hand so that the patient does not panic during the procedure. Would recommend people to visit the clinic for any dental issues. God speed to the entire team\u2026.",

His work speaks for itself and i am most comfortable and I've never had to get any procedure repeated. He ensures he always uses the best quality material and takes the time to explain to you in detail about each procedure.the amount i spend here definately seems worthwhile which  always leaves me walking out his clinic with a smile :) Thanks doc!",

I was feeling some pain and I reached him over the phone and he was so polite to attend my call promptly. He and his staff are treating people with the timely manner and time and waiting lines are prioritised as per the appointment. He explained me firstly the problems and suggested about possible treatment then I found myself secure and satisfied. I was visiting for my implant which I needed because I broke my teeth and offcourse it is a expensive procedure however he provided all the treatment and process. I also was told about costs and as per my confirmation he proceeded with the treatment. I was also allowed to pay in installments and provided with all the receipts and my case file.",

As I had gap only in front teeth I was not worried about my other teeths. I opted the last option and went for tooth bonding. The Dr. Pranay has done excellent jobs to fill the gap between the teeths. It looks very natural that even my friend couldn't find that I had any gap in between teeths. Highly recommended.",

I was searching so many dentist in google. After so many search i went to two three clinic in belandur they advised me took out the rct treated tooth and get implant. Atlast i went to smile cure dental clinic and consulted the Dr Pranay. He took x ray and told out of three root one root is not cleaned properly and due metal ceramic cap the ceramic layer will be cheaped off that's because the food was getting ready stuck there and cause gum infection. He advised me to re root canal for this tooth and next wisdom tooth removal. He also advised me the ceramic cap for this tooth. Comparing to other clinic treatment cost is not highly. The clinic is neat and clean and all the instrument were sterlized. I strongly recommend this clinic for the all treatment. ",

I was attended by Dr Pranay who listened my symptoms carefully and went for an x ray. After analysis the x ray it was found cavity was very deep and had to get a root canal treatment. Root canal treatment was done very carefully and Dr Pranay explained all steps.  Well and also explained each steps. I had to go in for 2sittings and I did not have pain after the first sitting. Overall it was stressfree experience and I knew that my teeth were in good hands and I guess what the entire root canal over in 45 minutes. \nCompared to previous experiences I had for root canal this had been the best experience for the root canal so far. After the ceramic crown I was not having any difference from natural teeth. Thanks doctor for very good treatment and smooth behaviour. Strongly recommended for the good treatment. ",

He is gentle and lets you know exactly what he is going to do and how long it should take and what to expect. He is continuously checking your comfort level to assure as his patient is ok. Their prices are reasonable and even held a check for me once for two days until I got paid. The dentist was my #1 fear all my life and while it is not or never will be a trip to a spa package treatment, it is quite comfortable and doable now!",

But to maintain hygiene and sterlisation inside the premises we need to follow some precautions to maintain health of my patients. And I hope you understand that in future. The Patient  which walked out just before you with shoes was a patient having artificial limb and so I guess to maintain his dignity I cannot ask him to remove his shoes.\nTake care and regards",

I underwent RCT, and even after huge infection, the overall treatment was painless and smooth.  Then I had gone with a tooth ache prob in the upper third molar commonly called the Wisdom tooth. I Dr.  Pranay  suggested that we extract it. On the  time  of the extraction, Dr   Pranay  was very comforting and he looked confident of the procedure. Extraction was done in 15 mins flat and clear cut instructions were given to be taken care in the coming days. Now I  am  fully happy  with  Root Canal Treatment  and  Wisdom Tooth  Extraction  . Both treatment were  finished in  single  sitting .  I  will  Recommend all of  my relatives and friends for  very good  Dental Treatment.",

Also, I could feel that he started conversations with me in the middle of examination in order to divert my attention from the fear of pain :) .

Surprisingly  he agreed to sit in the chair and doc made it into a game. The overall experience was pleasant and we will definitely visit again for his follow up . They were extremely patient in understanding the needs of a child and as a parent it made me feel comfortable. They were spot on with the diagnosis and explained the process in simple Steps. My  son  left the clinic smiling which I can say was a big relief as we don't want any negative experiences for him  to associate with regards to the dentist. I have a family dentist but  after  taking   treatment  here   i  feel  He is the  best  for  future  treatment.\r For My son we wanted some one who will be easy going , friendly and not appear to be somebody to be scared of. The team led by Dr  Pranay fits the bill perfectly. Would   strrecomongly mend it to all my friends and family.",

One day some of my frens told about dr. pranay then i visited to this clinic . dr pranay listened my all problems very peacefully and checked opg also. He has given some physiotherapy treatment, accupressure treatment and given me night guard. He asked to me 'r u doing teeth grinding in night time or not' I couldnt reply. after placing the night guard i feel very good and i will say to all of my frens to visit to smilecure multispecialiry dental clinic for any dental treatment and for critical disease. Your 50% disease will be solved by counselling itself. Thank you very much for nice treatment. ",

It was found out that previous doctor didnt do the filling till the end of the root and fourth root was left out as the doctor was not able to make out. After that reroot canal was done and again proper crown cutting of my two teeth has been done. Now i am very much satisfied with my painless reroot canal and cap. i strongly recommend this clinic for very good root canal treatment and any dental problem for my friends and my relatives.",

Therefore best solution is to go for braces. he has shown different kinds of slides of braces in laptop. I have seen metal steel braces, ceramic braces, lingual braces and invisble braces. He has given me option to choose anyone. Therefore i adopted ceramic braces which was within my economical range. .   I am  very  much glad to take  treatment from here  because  I  paid only  50 %  money  today and  rest in  11  months  instalment .   Strongly  Recomended  ",

Without a doubt, he is consistent both times and is very welcoming and friendly. He always explains beforehand what he will do to make sure that I am well-informed before carrying out the procedure. Not only does Dr  Pranay  give advice about how to prevent future damages to my teeth, but he also takes precautions by taking x-rays during my check-up to make sure that there were no holes in my teeth. He then proceeded to advise me that if there were any problems, then I should not hesitate to contact the dental practice. Overall, during both of my visits, he has been very helpful as a dentist should. I could not recommend him more. He is a great dentist. At this moment, I cannot think of how the service can improve as he provides a very good service. and good advices ",

He took the fear from me because of his expertise. I would always recommend him to all my friends. And moreover the after removal steps he mentioned was very helpful. I didn't feel any pain though its been 6 days as of today. Worth the doctor to visit. Thanks Dr pranay :)",

Compared to which i paid just 2500 for my rct over here and the quality of care has been absoultly the same. even for cap i had paid 4000. but here the same thing when i asked the price it was 3000.. after seeing all this i feel is most of the doctors r just demanding whatever price they feel is fine without even thinking about the patient..But i am happy that now i have found a reliable dentist whom i can trust for my dental treatments without worrying much about the cost and the care..thanks a lot to dr.pranay plz keep up the good work and practo too",

My wisdom tooth was completely decayed and was shown to me on the lcd monitor so that i can see what has gone wrong. On my first visit all my cavities were removed and teeth filling was done.
