We initially approached Sakara hospital \nwhere they suggested to get 7 teeth removed to clear all the infection as it was deep inside. We were shocked and thought of taking second opinion \nat Manipal. We consulted Dr. Achut Baliga and Dr. Sam who studied the situation in depth and informed us that they will have to operate under general anesthesia, but will take a conservative approach by not removing any tooth. They were thoroughly professional, very approachable and understood our concerns with care. My wife was operated and everything went as planned and she's now recovering exactly as explained to us before the surgery.\nI suggest everyone to consult these thoroughly professional and experienced doctor's for any major Oral and maxillofacial surgery.",

But he said he couldn't do it then. I explained that I have a baby at home and so it is difficult for me to come back too many times. He asked me to come at 4 pm the following day and assured me that he would start promptly and finish the procedure. I showed up the following day at 4 pm and he had left for the day!! This is just inexplicably unprofessional and something highly unexpected from a senior doctor. You can ignore his abrasive nature and sour personality, but this unprofessionalism can't be ignored.",

We initially approached Sakara hospital \nwhere they suggested to get 7 teeth removed to clear all the infection as it was deep inside. We were shocked and thought of taking second opinion \nat Manipal. We consulted Dr. Achut Baliga and Dr. Sam who studied the situation in depth and informed us that they will have to operate under general anesthesia, but will take a conservative approach by not removing any tooth. They were thoroughly professional, very approachable and understood our concerns with care. My wife was operated and everything went as planned and she's now recovering exactly as explained to us before the surgery.\nI suggest everyone to consult these thoroughly professional and experienced doctor's for any major Oral and maxillofacial surgery.",

But he said he couldn't do it then. I explained that I have a baby at home and so it is difficult for me to come back too many times. He asked me to come at 4 pm the following day and assured me that he would start promptly and finish the procedure. I showed up the following day at 4 pm and he had left for the day!! This is just inexplicably unprofessional and something highly unexpected from a senior doctor. You can ignore his abrasive nature and sour personality, but this unprofessionalism can't be ignored.",
