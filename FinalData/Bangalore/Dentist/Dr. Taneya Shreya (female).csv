,,0,0,YES,"I was worried about gap in my upper front teeth and had visited partha dental clinic in JP nagar. I was attended by Dr Taneya who helped me with veneers(some kind of cap) treatment. Once the treatment was done I was shocked , I couldn't believe how natural the treatment turned out. People now can't even make out it is cap. Super happy. 
Highly recommended 😁👍 Kudos Dr Taneya good work.Super humble and good attitude.",2023-10-25 10:20:32,False,True,Vinay,,,
