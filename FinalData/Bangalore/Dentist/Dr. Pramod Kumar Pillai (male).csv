,"Dental Checkup (General),",0,0,YES,"First and foremost thing about about this clinic is Dr. Pramod. He is very much dedicated and friendly in nature. Cleared all my doubts and explained many things which I never knew. The best thing was - He made himself available at a later time due to some issue in my schedule and advised me medicines since I was having unbearable tooth pain. 
The staffs were also very nice and professional. 
And last but not the least , the clinic was kept very neat and tidy. Kudos to the whole team !!!
