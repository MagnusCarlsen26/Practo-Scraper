,,0,0,YES,"Doctor is  very clear in communicating in simple words and very confident about the success of the treatment.  Without  much of formalities  he attends to his patients  instilling confidence  in them  about the procedure.  He keeps the patient about  his dental status at every stage and  I feel homely  at his unassuming  nature. Surely a patient will be safe in his hands .  When I first met him years back he had advised me to go for a few implantation.  I  contacted a few to know about their experience  of implantation  done elsewhere  which was negative.  So I hesitated to undergo as I am aged. I only underwent rootcanal  for a few few years back which was done excellently  by Dr. Reddy.  Having  convinced  I
 gathered courage  and went to him  for implantation.  I never expected that it would be done  painlessly.   Now  I a man of 84 is back with sweet sixteen teeth. Thanks to Dr. Venkateswara Reddy.
