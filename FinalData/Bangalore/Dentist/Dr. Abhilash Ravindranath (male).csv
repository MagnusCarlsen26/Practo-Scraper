None,"Dental Implant Fixing,Dental Implant Fixing,Dental Implant Fixing,Implant Rehabilitation,",0,0,YES,"I had been searching for a Dentist that was able to help me . Every time I found a new dentist I had to go through what was happening with my teeth and what I needed to relieve the pain and what I wanted my end goal to be. Each and every time I was left feeling unheard to the point that frustration set in. 
The last ""dentist"" I had seen for only one appointment yanked out three of my teeth on the top jaw as he ""knew"" what he wanted to do even if I had explained that my jaw bone had deteriorated and wouldn't support the ""implants"" he had in mind. I even had x-rays which showed him the bone deterioration.  After this appointment I had lost hope and was now walking around with not only really bad teeth but three missing on the side of my mouth which was very unattractive for anybody especially me.  
When I went in for my 1st appointment with Dr Pasare I was surprised that he actually listened to what was happening in my mouth, he understood that I had hypersensitive teeth which was coupled with my life long fear and angst of the Dentist. He also knew exactly what we needed to do to achieve the final outcome. Some of my demands were near impossible, however, Dr Pasare accommodated my requests. We would have the best ""Animated Discussions"" in regards to the direction we needed to take. 
Finally I was ready to undertake the procedure I desperately needed for health reasons: full dental implants of my top and lower jaw. We began the procedure on 17th April 2015 on my top jaw. Dr Pasare was very supportive throughout the whole procedure and nothing was every a problem. 
We finished the top jaw and the results are unbelievable. 
Looking at the before photo's seemed more like a mugshot compared to the finished product. 
My years of suffering in silence and doing everything to avoid smiling are over. 
I Highly and Whole Heartily Recommend Dr Pasare to not only listen but hear what you need and then support you through the entire process. 
He was gently throughout the procedure keeping in mind that I would absolutely literally jump every single time a dentist needed to do anything with my teeth. 
I know it's crazy, however, I'm really looking forward to starting the procedure on my lower jaw.
Forever Grateful that there are still Dental Professionals out there dedicated to really making a Difference to Their Patients Lives

None,None,0,0,YES,"This place is great!
Starting with the reception, it has a clean and modern feel, the staff is extremely helpful and courteous. 
The assistant staff is very thoughtful. They go out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. It's small things that made the difference to me, like offering me water to drink during procedure because I was coughing, asking if I was okay to proceed..explaining what they were doing as they did it,  They pay attention to patient comfort. They did good work.

As for the Dentist, I saw Dr.Abhilash because I had an issue with jaw pain. It was persistent and driving me crazy. He explained everything he was going to do, what he was thinking, and took a very gradual approach to addressing the issue. It came down to something very simple. We got to that conclusion because he took his time in speaking with me, doing the easy things first, and not jumping into a costly and unneeded procedure. I appreciate his patience and his thoughtfulness. He gave me teeth guards to wear in the night. They are comfortable. I have worn them at night everyday for about a month, and I notice a significant difference.

This is the first dentist that I've ever truly liked. I really feel like this place is focused on doing whats best for the patient as opposed to making money.

Next to my lower molar there is a gum pocket in which remnants of food get stuck sometimes, as a result there occurs swelling.  I tried hard to convince them them I don't have any pain I just want some solution to get get rid of that pocket. They suggested me tooth extraction.  My tooth is exactly fine and even gum is not that much over grown.  Appointment was booked for next day I deposited 2000 in advance.  I told them in my next visit I have changed my mind  for extraction,  the best part was that they did not forced me or suggested me to go for it,  but asked for my account details  so that they can refund my advance. 

Only thing that I missed was trust there are so many treatments available for gums now a days I was not convinced for tooth extraction,  there was a continuous doubt in my head did they understood my problem cleanly or not.

When asked about what a bt or ct test meant, he told they are medical terms and just go and show it at diagnostic centre. Basically, he did not want to spend even 30 minutes in trying to answer our questions. I would not recommend him if you expect a more friendly, polite and doctor who would respect the patient.
