"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Cavities,",0,0,YES,This was my first ever visit to a dentist. Something got stuck in my tooth and due to pain I had no choice but to visit a dentist. I visited Dr. Reema as her clinic was close to my residence. She immediately resolved the issue and through X ray scanning explained that the problem was because of a deep cavity. She recommended filling the cavity and went on to do it in a very professional way. I strongly recommend Dr. Reema for any dental issues. I found her very polite and extremely professional.,2024-06-25 14:11:49,False,True,Abhinav Alva,,,
,,0,0,YES,"Reema Madam is one of the most professional and well mannered doctors, I have had the fortune of being treated by. I have always had slight tooth pain for years, but was ignoring it thinking it to be just sensitivity to cold. But this time the pain was strong and affected my daily life. I visited her in the last week of November, and I wanted to make sure my tooth was treated before my wedding in mid December. Madam closely observed me and declared that I needed root canal, as there was considerable decay and caries in tooth 46. In 3 sittings within 8 days, Madam completed the entire surgery and capping process. I observed during the treatment, she was always very careful not to hurt me too much, and very considerate of any discomfort I might have felt. I was comfortable from start to finish, ofcourse with the slight natural pain of a surgery, but the anesthesia that Madam applied, really really helped. I returned back to my hometown for my wedding, and since then haven't felt even an iota of pain or discomfort. I want to thank Madam from the bottom of my heart, and declare that doctors like Reema Madam are amazing assets to the society, and elevate the patient doctor experience to a supreme level!",2022-01-08 10:07:59,False,True,Sarthak Mohapatra,Thank you for the valuable  feedback...will always continue to  provide quality dental treatment.,2022-01-08T13:49:06+0000,Dr. Reema Naik Shetty
,,0,0,YES,"I had lot of  complications such as tooth extraction, cavity filling and bridge replacement on lower right molars and crown on an upper right molar.  Generally I am always reluctant in approaching a dentist since I find the drilling sound very disturbing. 

When I visited Dr.Reema Shetty, by appointment through Practo she welcomed me and  engaged me into a most friendly conversation as if she had known me for long.  This made me feel comfortable and I lost my general fear towards dentists.  Every procedure she would explain what she is going to do and what sort of pain and how much, I am going to feel and how I  should cope with it.  She would carefully explain what medcines I should take before coming for the session and the type of medicines to be taken afterwards.  She is capable in instilling in her patients a high level of confidence. 
I thank he for doing giving me an excellent treatment  to my  complicated situation.  I wish that she grows Godspeed in her profession bringing relief  to those suffering from dental ailments.  I would certainly recommedn Dr.Reema Naik Shety to all my friends.",2021-11-10 04:51:37,False,True,Mohan Kamath,Thank you for the detailed and valuable feedback ,2023-04-18T16:13:51+0000,Dr. Reema Naik Shetty
