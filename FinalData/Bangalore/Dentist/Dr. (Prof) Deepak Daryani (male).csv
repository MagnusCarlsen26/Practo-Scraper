I must say that though I went for a second opinion after having consulted another doctor, I'm glad I visited this centre. Now on to the results first...

I did not undergo a single extraction and still no pain so far. Dr. Deepak analysed me first and suggested clearly that I needed composite filling followed by two RCTs and then fibre.optic post and then a crown. Each stage was then explained again by Dr.Pujitha. I was given clear indication of seatings it would take, time it would take, cost based in various options right from post to crown and lifetime for each options. 

Dr. Deepak was extremely friendly.and at the same time has an uncanny ability to ease you from pressure and super efficient. He is so methidocal in terms of what he wants you to do and what sort of treatment he is going to provide. He also makes us aware of the precaution well before.

The extraction was done successfully and it was made sure that there is no post operative bleeding and that the patient is comfortable. The extraction was done very conservatively and in the minimum time for patients comfort which we think should be appreciated. We performed the surgery  with minimum trauma and used cangulants to make sure that there is minimum bleeding during and post surgically. The surgery(extraction) was performed in minimum time and with no complication at all. The less time taken is actually very good for patient and it should not be cause of concern. In fact more time taken is more agonising to the patient. So we feel you should be happy about less time taken as the job was well done in minimum time with no complication what so ever. We charge a consultation of Rs 500/- when the patient comes for the first time. This is one time fee for consultation and registration which holds good for next 1 year.
