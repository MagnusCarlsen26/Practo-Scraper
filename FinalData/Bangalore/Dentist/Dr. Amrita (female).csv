"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Found my Doctor and I'm never going to anyone else till the time I am in Bangalore. She cares about patients and is quite upfront. Tells you clearly what is the problem and how it can be handled. Doesn't try to do everything herself. She'll get you expert dental surgeons if needed. Takes time to talk to patients and explain to them what they can and cannot do. Answers all your questions and more. After my tooth extraction I was sat down for about an hour and told each instuction in detail. she ensured it was drilled down in my head. Lot of problems can be avoided if patients understand what precautions to take. Like I cannot sleep keeping that cheek down where she operated. I think she might even come in my dreams and tell me to not sleep on that side. Or I'll hear her stern voice in my head if I'm even thinking about eating something hot or spicy after the surgery. 😂

But jokes apart, she really cares about her patients and give them ample time. Trust her, be honest, and leave it to her to see your problem solved. 😊",2020-12-19 14:04:18,False,True,Abhishek Divakar,Thx for ur feedback abhishek 🙂,2020-12-26T12:34:53+0000,Dr. Amrita

I've never had a lesser painful tooth injection ever . I thank the doctor's skills for that.
