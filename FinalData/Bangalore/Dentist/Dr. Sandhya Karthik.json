She builds a rapo with teh patients which helps the patients to be confident and comfortable enough to discuss there problems clearly.\n\nI went to doctor for the first time in May or June for getting my root canal treatment done. The treatment of root canal was painless, which is usually bit painfull. After the root canal treatment doctor prescribed me few pain killer and antibiotics.\n\nI also had the problem of Dental floss ( skin growth between two teeth ), which was also treated by Dr. Sandhya Karthik.\n\nAlong with Dr. Sandhya Karthik, her husband also practices in the clinic who is also equally good at treatment. There wont be much delay by doctor in attending the patients.\n\nUsually there would be a waiting of five to ten minutes. The waiting hall is tidy and doctor have two staff who are also polite as doctor, and helpfull at times.\n\nI would be happy to recommend Dr. Sandhya Karthik to my friends and family members.\n\n",

As my regular doctor was out of town on an emergency I visited Dr.Sandhya Karthik. I had sever ache in gums and teeth. Doctor listened to all my problems politely and with lot of patience. It was very comfortable for me to speak about the problem to the doctor.\nDr.Sandhya is very attentive at her treatments and she treats patients with lot of care . After basic investigations doctor suggested me to go for x-ray of my teeth, which I did not feel was irrelevant. Though this was my first consultation with the doctor i was really impressed by the way she treats her patients and the patience to listen to them. The consultation fee was also not much more compared to others.\nAfter an emergency check up and x-ray, I followed up for treatment with my regular doctor. And now my problem of gums and teeth is solved.\nFinally i would recommend this doctor to my known persons and family members as well.",

After the root canal treatment doctor prescribed me few pain killer and antibiotics.\n\nI also had the problem of Dental floss ( skin growth between two teeth ), which was also treated by Dr. Sandhya Karthik.\n\nAlong with Dr. Sandhya Karthik, her husband also practices in the clinic who is also equally good at treatment. There wont be much delay by doctor in attending the patients.\n\nUsually there would be a waiting of five to ten minutes. The waiting hall is tidy and doctor have two staff who are also polite as doctor, and helpfull at times.\n\nI would be happy to recommend Dr. Sandhya Karthik to my friends and family members.\n\n",

It was very comfortable for me to speak about the problem to the doctor.\nDr.Sandhya is very attentive at her treatments and she treats patients with lot of care . After basic investigations doctor suggested me to go for x-ray of my teeth, which I did not feel was irrelevant. Though this was my first consultation with the doctor i was really impressed by the way she treats her patients and the patience to listen to them. The consultation fee was also not much more compared to others.\nAfter an emergency check up and x-ray, I followed up for treatment with my regular doctor. And now my problem of gums and teeth is solved.\nFinally i would recommend this doctor to my known persons and family members as well.",
