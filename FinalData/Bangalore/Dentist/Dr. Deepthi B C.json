Her commitment to patient education is truly commendable, and I felt well-informed at every step of the way.\n\nWhat sets Dr. Deepthi apart is her genuine concern for her patients. She went above and beyond by taking the time to speak with my parents, who were understandably worried about my dental health. Her ability to communicate complex dental issues in a way that reassured both me and my family speaks volumes about her professionalism and dedication to patient care.\n\nBeyond the technical aspects of dentistry, Dr. Deepthi has a rare gift of making her patients feel at ease.\n\n",

Her commitment to patient education is truly commendable, and I felt well-informed at every step of the way.\n\nWhat sets Dr. Deepthi apart is her genuine concern for her patients. She went above and beyond by taking the time to speak with my parents, who were understandably worried about my dental health. Her ability to communicate complex dental issues in a way that reassured both me and my family speaks volumes about her professionalism and dedication to patient care.\n\nBeyond the technical aspects of dentistry, Dr. Deepthi has a rare gift of making her patients feel at ease.\n\n",

She grinded the back teeth and after a few minutes I immediately felt relief like all the heaviness was gone and she has given me a night gaurd to wear and my symptoms have reduced. Her new clinic is very clean and the doctor is very patient to listen to my problem. Thank you Dr. Deepthi and team. ",

Dr. Deepthi conducted the procedures with the latest equipment and utmost professionalism. Despite my initial apprehension, I didn't feel any pain during or after the treatment. Dr  was very kind and sweet which added to the overall positive experience. I highly recommend this clinic for anyone seeking quality dental care.",
