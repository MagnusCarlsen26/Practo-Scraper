That place seemed so new and and was not very happy with the fact that within a minute all my treatments were chalked out. So I gave up initially and then another bit of my tooth cracked which is when I got a little worried. Found Dr.Sodhi by location on practo and called her immediately and it was almost instant that I felt rather comfortable. I asked her if i could ask her two questions and then went on to ask another one at which point she reminded me jovially that this was my third question.. So it started out quite well and when I went in for the appointment she took her time understanding my concerns and the fact that although I wanted this done I also wanted to be a little comfortable with the entire plan. She mentioned that I needed quite a few cavities filled and in between I had got into the the habit of chewing pan masala which had also stained my teeth and that needed to be taken care off as well and also my tooth needed a root canal. So all in all would take a while and she wanted to know what my pain levels were and so we started with basic cavities filling. And she is extremely patient..The number of times I've had her stop because it hit a sensitive stop and she just patiently waited joking that she would charge me more( she never did in case you are wondering). But it also goes to show that she is not doing this just for the heck of it but because she cares for her patients. The root canal treatment took slightly longer due to my work schedules but that was also very well done. When my gums hurt or whatever that feeling was she took her time to explain that it is that area being adjusted with the cap that she had placed.. Really really good. My pain is all gone and my teeth feel amazing. She also went out of her way to try and help me quit smoking because it is not only spoiling my teeth but more importantly my health. Showed me so many different avenues. But I'm still having trouble with the quit. That obviously isn't the doctors fault but my lack of willingness to quit. Only mentioned this because she will not only look at her job at hand but will also take interest in making you feel like a comfortable patient. Well, at least that was my experience and I can safely say that when my dad finally decided to get his teeth filled I will be bringing him here and when anyone wants a dentists recommendation this would be the place. I am comfortable here and I would happily travel the distance to get to this place if I were to ever shift from where I stay at the moment. Thank you Dr. Sodhi.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"“My profession does not excuse me”- this sentence by Dr. Aman Sodhi during our interaction is a gist to explain her dedication towards profession. However, elaborating my experience during and after the dental treatment explains the service blueprint of the treatment process. I had one of my tooth filling in quadrant-3 molar tooth fallen/ chipped of during COVID-19 lockdown, had no other option but to postpone the treatment. Over a period of time, the tooth had infected beyond regular filling and it needed “Root Canal Treatment” (at this point I was so paranoid, that I gave a thought of not getting the treatment). With no option left; agreed for a “Root Canal Treatment” half heartedly. I have seen both my parents getting RCT and both of them had bad experiences and lot of pain during the procedure. Dr. Aman ensured, RCT will not pain and assured she would take care and nothing to worry. I was very paranoid as the  RCT procedure was about to begin, Kudos to the patience of Dr. Aman (haven’t seen a doctor as patient as she is); she was very cautious and patient throughout the process. She explained me about the process during treatment and also prepared me (this made me aware of what is about to come).  Dr. Aman used to crack jokes and put me into a conversation to divert my attention during the treatment so that I don’t think of pain and be aware of the process. In the end RCT, went well; however it was not the easy one for Dr. Aman - there were 4 canines in the tooth and it took longer for her to finish; may be she would have finished it in 2 visits, but to my paranoid attitude she took 4 clinic visits to finish the process. Dr. Aman is hands on in judging the situation and understanding the problem - also she resolves the problem with best solution. 

Now, I blindly trust Dr. Aman and follow her instructions when it about my dental health, though I got couple of my dental fillings redone after RCT treatment, the first experience is always a laying stone for future. Now I recommend all my loved ones to go to Dr. Aman for dental treatment.

She really does a good job in gaining the patients trust, & needless to say she does  an excellent job on the teeth & she explains very neatly on the problems in the teeth & what can be done, later on how to take care of the teeth & follow up sessions.

She explains the tablets to take and does not give high dosage of tablets unnecessarily.

After RCT was complete, I had zero pain and didn't take any pain killers.

I opted for Silicon cap after RCT was complete,she took personal attention in picking the right size and color for the crown to suit the rest of the teeth.

She got a full picture and explained to me what was causing my limited mouth opening and what were the problems with the root canal treated tooth and other problems too. The procedure was complex because of the various problems I had and she was kind, generous and patient with her time and expertise. She’s very professional and takes the time to explain things and also offer options regarding treatment in a way that a lay person can understand without dumbing things down or complicating them. 

It took around 6 sittings to get my root canal done and each sitting about an hour because of my limited mouth opening. She was patient, and she put me at ease while making sure that I was comfortable during the procedure. This is the most enjoyable dental procedure I’ve done despite it being very complex. Her fees are so very reasonable and I was very pleased that every charge was explained to me and at every point there was full transparency. 

I see her and her team work with so much professionalism, passion and genuine care for their patients. That is so very rare in these days and Dr. Aman is officially one of my favourite doctors now.
