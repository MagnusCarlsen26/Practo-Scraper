"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Oral Infections,",0,0,YES,"I came to know about Dr Mallesh through my office colleague. His shop is located near Hosakerehalli cross (1st floor). 

He is super friendly to talk to and explained clearly what was the issue with my mother's teeth, she had root infection across multiple front teeth. He suggested apicoectomy surgery which was completed after root canal. He also helped us in choosing the right crown since a colour mismatch can be detrimental to the looks. All the appointments were done through phone and he was okay to reschedule a couple of times when we couldn't make it due to office meetings. I have recommended him to all my family and friends.
