"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My mother (72 yrs) had a root canal treatment done for one of her tooth earlier at another clinic which broke eventually and had developed slight complications to refix it.  I heard some good reviews about Dr. Vivek Bagga and decided to take my mother for a consultation.  Dr. Vivek, being a Dental Surgeon by profession treated my mother with utmost care and replaced it an artificial ceramic tooth by providing the right treatment . Highly recommend Dr. Vivek Bagga as he handled my Mother's delicate condition with complete care and the Junior Doctors at the Clinic are equally efficient. We had constant follow up calls from them to check how my Mother was feeling after every sitting. Totally satisfied with the services.
