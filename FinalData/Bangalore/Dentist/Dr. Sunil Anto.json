Rahim Khan (he runs Smile Lounge Clinic in Indira Nagar). I trusted Dr Rahim and got the surgery done by Sunil in Smile Lounge Clinic. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE DURING & AFTER SURGERY.\nHe didn't even wash his hand before starting the surgery !!\nHe was not clear about the position of tooth as has not done proper study of X-Ray beforehand,hence the overall procedure took more than 25 min. Few other objectionable things which he did were-\n1) Answering the mobile phone during the surgery\n2) tried referring the X Ray after cutting my gums \n3) Instead of injecting the local anesthesia in gums,he sprayed some portion of it in my mouth\n\nAfter 22 days of surgery also pain didn't subside for me. When asked for the reason,Dr Rahim casually told, you were UNLUCKY as your ligament near adjacent tooth has been damaged during surgery. Now, he is advising me to go for root canal treatment .\nI had very bad experience with these two dr, dont recommend these doctors to anyone.",
