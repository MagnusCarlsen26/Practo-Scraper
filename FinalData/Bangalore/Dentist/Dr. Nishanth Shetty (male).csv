Summary : Highly recommend

Story:
So, I went with the complaint of sensation and pain in my extreme right wisdom tooth on the lower jaw. Dr. Pooja , explained me the issue , after examining the x-ray (that took place in the clinic itself), and suggested for an extraction, giving a detailed insight on why that is the best possible remedy with the present situation. Dr. Nishanth , is very humble and cooperative and most of all, ensures that as a patient, you know every detail about your issue, the detailed resolution/procedure, why that procedure is needed, etc. etc. This helps to build the bond of trust with the doctors and today I underwent the extraction procedure and it went so smooth.  Not only he is highly skilled, he makes sure that you are comfortable throughout the procedure and extremely grounded.

Honestly no one wishes to Visit a clinic or a hospital and most people (95%} ignore dental issues.
Most people are all scared to visit the dentist as they feel that a dentist's job is to remove our teeth that will cause pain. In actual, a dentist's job is to relieve ua from pain by providing us the best possible treatment. Dr.Nishanth Sir does exactly that for his patients. One doesn't feel the pain while undergoing a procedure as Dr.Nishanth has Magical Hands.
Before starting any treatment he takes us through our current medical condition and then suggests the treatment option and only post proper explaination proceeds with the treatment.
After the treatment is done, he explains the patients in detail once again about the same and also on the way forward.
One of the best things about Dr.Nishanth Sir is that he is not driven my money and his motive is  to see his patients getting relieved from pain and smile before leaving his clinic.

He is such a friendly guy. Takes time to explain you the condition, the process to fix it. My condition requires me to remove one tooth and get braces, and I know this is true since many other dentists have opined the same. The good thing about this visit was that he told me 'that' same way and also suggested other methods that which can be used to treat the same. Explained each process and why he believes one to be better than the other in my case. I live in Whitefield and I am happy to have found his clinic. In due course, over the next few months, I will definitely get my procedure done by him.
Coming to the money part, no where did I ever feel that I was being treated as a cash machine and that the treatments being suggested are witb due diligence to treat my actual problem. In my case, the gaps need to be filled and the only method is to get a pair of braces. He suggested that though this is NOT super important, but it is a permanent solution. The other solution would be to get a cleanup every 5-6 months (which anyway of all us should get done). ",2021-06-26 06:29:51,False,True,Anirban Mukherjee,,,

My visit to his clinic was an impulsive decision while I just went through available Dentists in Whitefield Area. 

During my first visit itself I was totally convinced with how he explained my dental issues and the treatment options available for me. On the very first appointment itself I got my braces done at his clinic. 
He is extremely professional, very patient and detail oriented Doctor. 
According to me, my dental alignment issue is bit complicated because I have consulted at least 5 doctors till date and my issue was never sorted ever since my teens. I had finally given up. But now after almost 15 years during this COVID season, I thought to give it one final try.  
My treatment started in Oct 2020 and to be very honest, I can see visible changes. Best thing is - as a patient now I trust the process and I feel confident with the treatment. 
I truly appreciate his patience level in providing solutions and altering the treatment accordingly. Many thanks Doc.
