Saved a lot of time. The entire RCT procedure and tooth filling was done on the same day by Dr. Jessica and Dr. Aditi.\n\nI had a very great experience and would highly recommend Elite Esthetics & Dental Clinic to anyone seeking top-notch dental care.",

At Elite Esthetics Clinic, Dr Aditi clearly explained out the details and procedures suitable for my skin and the sessions have been very pleasant. I started seeing good results after even one session of hydrafacial and chemical peel and am very happy with the services here.\nDr Aditi is thorough in her examination and also answers questions and doubts clearly before and during the treatment. The clinic is also very clean and hygienic , nd the ambience is soothing and calm. There is almost no waiting time and the staff is well courteous and follow up after the procedure with calls about the post care. Strongly recommend this place for anyone with skin issues. Affordable prices too.",

All my son's tooth issues were explained and dealt with so well that he came out smiling and shocked us. Thankyou Elite and Doctor Aditi. Keep it up. I am writing such a long one, coz I can't thank Elite enough for the wonderful treatment my son got. Thankyou Elite. KEEP IT UP. \nTHANKYOU. ",

But this time around , I felt for the first time, what a good patient care looks like. Doctor was very patient with my many different queries, she explained why implants would be better suited to my needs . \nShe explained to me the different types of implants, their cost implications and other pros and cons. She also explained to me the treatment procedure , no of sittings. \nAll in all, a very positive experience and highly recommend to everyone.",
