I am lucky and got saved by dr Sulaxana. She is one of the best Dr.\nIf you reading this review doctor\u201d Thank you so much\u201d\u2764\ufe0f",

(I have done the said RCT earlier from some clinic in Jayanagar). As the infection was severe, it took a lot a sittings , but Dr. Sulaxana attended me with much enthusiasm and care at each sitting. Around 5 sittings were done for just cleaning the teeth thoroughly. I was genuinely scared at first when show me photos and x-rays of my teeth, but Dr. instilled confidence in me that this can be taken care. She follows up on phone a day after the procedure and even later , if needed. Eventhough I dread going to dentist and my teeth was in a really pathetic condition, this was a pleasant experience much to my surprise. I highly recommend her for any RCT related problems. Also, the clinic is easily accessible and is located opposite More Supermarket on New Thippassandra Main Road.",

So, had completely stopped eating from that side since last 10 years and visited multiple dentists and ENT specialists for the same but did not get any solution. \nDr. Sulaxana identified the issue in the first visit itself and after changing the crown, I am feeling much better. \nShe is always smiling, calm and answers all the queries patiently.\nI would like to thank Dr. Sulaxana for resolving my tricky dental issue. I think I have found my go to dentist in case of any dental issues in future!",

Also I had chipped my lateral incisor and asked her what to do about it, she suggested doing a filling.... Her work is really amazing.... Now i have a beautiful smile... Thank you Dr Sulaxana....

Around 5 sittings were done for just cleaning the teeth thoroughly. I was genuinely scared at first when show me photos and x-rays of my teeth, but Dr. instilled confidence in me that this can be taken care. She follows up on phone a day after the procedure and even later , if needed. Eventhough I dread going to dentist and my teeth was in a really pathetic condition, this was a pleasant experience much to my surprise. I highly recommend her for any RCT related problems. Also, the clinic is easily accessible and is located opposite More Supermarket on New Thippassandra Main Road.",

She did a great job on a horrible tooth-root canal that was done previouslly, that should have had me in agony but instead I din't  even take tylenol! I feel great! Also didn't bite my tongue or cheek. She was great at anesthesia placement. When dentists over numb my mouth I accidently bite myself badly but the numbing was accurate and only on that part of my mouth and I was able to eat shortly after without needing a babies bib. Overall great experience!  Oh and very thorough in her explanation of xray's and procedures before starting the work. That was fun. Learned a lot. She explained everything in detail and broke it down for me, It was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had at a dental office it is definitely my home now for Dental work! I will highly recommend her to anyone that is looking for dental work ! Thank you again an amazing experience!",
