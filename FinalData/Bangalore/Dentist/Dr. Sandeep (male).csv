"Value for money,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,NO,"I am not sure what is the correct option to select over here for the above questions because, I made an appointment for Dr Sandeep, but I never met him. So the feedback options provided above are irrelevant to me. My experience is as below -

The location in google maps is not correct. Firstly had to struggle to find the exact location of the clinic by calling them up multiple times. Finally when I reached the clinic they claimed to have moved to this new location which is not updated in google maps. Me and my wife visited the clinic on time. I had the appointment for both me and my wife for Dr Sandeep as the reviews were good for the doctor even though the consultation fee was on a higher side for Dr Sandeep. Reaching the clinic on time, had the registration done for both of us. I was asked to lie down on a dental bed for examination. The process was good, and as per expectations. A female doctor visited me and treated my issues, but the clinic members did not inform me that Dr Sandeep is not available/not taking up my case. 

When i pay higher price for a doctor, I expect that doctor to treat me. Even though i did not have any such problem with the doctor who treated me and my wife, but this did not look ethical to me. You bill me higher according to senior doctor and I get treated by someone else! I can see the Practo assurance to meet Dr Sandeep which never happened. Dr Sandeep charges 500 INR for consultation but others charge 300 INR for consultation. Its a straight loss for 200 INR for both me and my wife. ",2020-10-11 16:51:34,False,False,Amitakhya Bhuyan,,,
