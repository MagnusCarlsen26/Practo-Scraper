,,0,0,YES,"I'm glad that i consulted Dr.Kavitha on time. I had a gum bleeding issue and i consulted her. She did the deep cleaning pretty well and the whole process was smooth. I was so satisfied with her work. She is very professional and friendly. Importantly, she made me understand the cause and precautionary measures to be taken later. 

I greatly recommend her to everyone.
