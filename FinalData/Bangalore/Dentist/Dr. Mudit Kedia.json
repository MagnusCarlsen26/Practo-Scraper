As you mentioned in the morning when you had visited you did not have an appointment. We had already informed that it would take time and we accommodated you in between patients for a check-up. In the evening when you visited, there was another root canal treatment going on for the patient prior to you. Being a medical procedure we cannot rush with treatments and sometimes it is difficult to anticipate the exact time required. You had to wait half an hour for your appointment, which as per me is not something that you should be disappointed about as even if you were on the chair for the treatment, we would not have hurried up with the procedure as per the requirement. We tried to reach you again later and Dr. Swati had called you personally. \nWe really do not appreciate this impatience in a healthcare facility. \nRegards,\nDr. Mudit Kedia.",

I have visited their clinic for check up today morning at 11am, where i had to wait for 1 hour to get addressed by someone just to check  and tell me to come in the evening. Okay! This time i have taken an appointment at 6:45pm and reached to the clinic on time. My luck is bad this time also i had to wait for half an hour and no one addressed. I don't understand the cause of taking appointment when it is not maintained by these so called professionals. I would recommend if someone is visiting this clinic for the first time make your mind to patiently wait for 1hr to he addressed by someone in the clinic",

As you mentioned in the morning when you had visited you did not have an appointment. We had already informed that it would take time and we accommodated you in between patients for a check-up. In the evening when you visited, there was another root canal treatment going on for the patient prior to you. Being a medical procedure we cannot rush with treatments and sometimes it is difficult to anticipate the exact time required. You had to wait half an hour for your appointment, which as per me is not something that you should be disappointed about as even if you were on the chair for the treatment, we would not have hurried up with the procedure as per the requirement. We tried to reach you again later and Dr. Swati had called you personally. \nWe really do not appreciate this impatience in a healthcare facility. \nRegards,\nDr. Mudit Kedia.",

I don't understand the cause of taking appointment when it is not maintained by these so called professionals.
