We panicked and called lots of clinics nearby but dint find anyone ready to open on a sunday . Dr Sapna came in 10 min and opened the clinic for my father's sake. \nShe immediately removed the teeth and made my father so relaxed . She was well equipped and checked his BP and blood sugar before the treatment . The clinic is so beautifully designed and serilization  is given utmost importance.She was very thorough and professional. Her team followed up on the recovery too . \n Now I take my whole family to her including my kids. My kid got his Rct done there and was taken care of lovingly . This review is long overdue . Thank you Dr .Sapna for being a kind and honest doctor. I highly recommend her clinic in Basavanagar.",

Her dedication to what she had to do was quite impressive as she went above and beyond what she had to do by working on some irky areas in my teeth. A very affable personality and that's what one needs from dentists. Keep spreading dental cheer. :-)",

Dr Sapna came in 10 min and opened the clinic for my father's sake. \nShe immediately removed the teeth and made my father so relaxed . She was well equipped and checked his BP and blood sugar before the treatment . The clinic is so beautifully designed and serilization  is given utmost importance.She was very thorough and professional. Her team followed up on the recovery too . \n Now I take my whole family to her including my kids. My kid got his Rct done there and was taken care of lovingly . This review is long overdue . Thank you Dr .Sapna for being a kind and honest doctor. I highly recommend her clinic in Basavanagar.",

Her dedication to what she had to do was quite impressive as she went above and beyond what she had to do by working on some irky areas in my teeth. A very affable personality and that's what one needs from dentists. Keep spreading dental cheer. :-)",
