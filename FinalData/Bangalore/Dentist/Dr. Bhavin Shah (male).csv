Terrible Communication *** ******************* What can you do if the Doctor and the billing desk are hand in hand in confusing the patients with treatment charges? Billing desk (Ms. Payal) at American dental won't even get back to you if you question it. I had a root canal where crown fitting session was horrible. If you value your money and your time - Don't book a slot with Dr. Bhavin Shah. When Ms. Payal at front desk or doctor explains about charges, keep a notebook nearby and record the conversation. It took no time to go back on what was told and what was charged for the complete treatment.
