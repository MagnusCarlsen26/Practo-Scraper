"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Tooth Sensitivity,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Abhisheak's (SLV Dental) diagnosis is excellent and he has a genuine intent of suggesting the right treatment - I was suffering from a minor tooth sensitivity in one area and Dr. Abhisheak suggested to not go for any RCT at this stage and try to use anti-sensitivity toothpaste - and it worked perfectly !! Whereas before SLV Dental - I had gone to a couple of places (the most popular ones in Bangalore - you can guess). And those other places told it's a cavity and needs RCT and capping treatment. Hence, a big factor - trust - is something you will find with Dr. Abhisheak.

Apart from this - I had been a having a tooth cavity and decayed wisdom tooth in the other areas. I had been delaying my treatment for quite sometime. I decided to get both things done by Dr. Abhisheak. It was a seamless and professional process. And after the treatment, Dr. Abhisheak used to regularly follow up to do a quick check-in on my status. Sometimes when I felt over-bearing pain - he was available for quick checkin on WhatsApp. I really liked this - because the treatment does not end with the procedure - there is a lot of post-procedure care needed. This is mostly not available in other places.

Thus, I had an overall outstanding experience with Dr. Abhisheak and SLV Dental. Biggest factors for me - trust, right diagnosis, seamless and professional, friendliness and post-procedure quick checkins.",2024-05-13 12:50:00,False,True,sahil singhal,,,
