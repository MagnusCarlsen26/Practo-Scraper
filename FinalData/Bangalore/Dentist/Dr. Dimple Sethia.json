That is the first thing i want to tell you. \nSecondly the thing you all should know is that_ Dr Dimple Sethia is one of the kind doctor who changed my entire experience. She has the skills and the way procedures executed are exceptional. I have been treated by the best doctor! \nI would definitely recommend to all viewers / reader to approach.
