"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"This was our 3rd visit to this Doctor during covid times - the 1st was for our son's RCT + crown, the 2nd was for my husband's bridge and now, the 3rd for my RCT+crowns. 
As always, we were apprehensive to venture out during this 2nd covid wave and waited until the last minute to visit the Doctor. As always, the Doctor's clinic just soothed our nerves and gave us confidence.

Cleanliness during covid times: 
We were sprayed with sanitizer, our O2 levels and temperature noted and politely asked to sit in a large, clean waiting room while we filled up a form. We waited only for about 5 mins.

Detailed examination & patient explanation:
Then, the Doctor's staff (duty Doctors, perhaps) checked my molars and wisdom tooth and took an X-ray . Again, very, very clean atmosphere which constantly gave us reassurance...
Then, the Doctor himself had a look and explained in detail the requirement for RCT - the what, the why, the how, the options and the cost. All very clear and upfront. 
 
The Procedure:
When we wanted the RCT done immediately, the Doctor and his staff painstakingly completed the procedure of RCT in one sitting, professionally, ensuring it was painless - I tried my best to relax (this was my first RCT and I was really tensed) thanks to the duty Doctors and the soothing hindi oldies in the background.

Follow-up after the Procedure:
The Doctor spent time to explain the next steps (we had opted for crowns) and how to take care of myself during the next few hours and days after the RCT. 
The next morning, a nice lady (duty Doctor, I assume) called me to specifically check how I felt and if I had slept well at night. She gave me some advice and promised to call once the crowns were ready.

Overall, we are super satisfied with the Colonel's Dental Spa. He is so disciplined (with or without covid) and this is one quality which stands out from other clinics. His concern and personally overseeing procedures is the icing on the cake.
We are so grateful for the Doctor's sense of duty and service towards people in need during these gloomy times...",2021-06-07 09:08:06,False,True,BEE SHERIFF,"Thank you ma‚Äôam for your keen observation, your positive feedback and your trust in us",2021-06-08T04:03:46+0000,Dr. (Col) M. C. Sharma

Our Ancestors have recognized and importance of Doctors and have said this as a profound appreciation of the Doctor‚Äôs role in the society.

My mother had problems with her teeth with almost the left side of the mouth unusable to chew food and eat. And was refusing to go to any doctor for treatment.

This led us to come to Sharma‚Äôs Dental Spa LLP and meet Dr. Col M C Sharma, where all the doctors interacted with a convincing voice and explained the different processes to be done and time involved. 

The conversations boosted the confidence of my mother to get treated. The end result is remarkable, and my mother is able to chew food on both sides of the mouth thereby improving the digestion and also overall health and wellbeing.
  

I personally thank Dr. M C Sharma and whole team of doctors at Sharma‚Äôs Dental Spa LLP, for the wonderful service rendered to my family members and wish him all the best.

They were very old with gaps between the caps and the gum where food was getting stock. I have been using dental floss for many years after each meal to remove the food particles which could cause bacteria to develop. ** ***** ****** ** * **** **** ******* *** confident of what the treatment should be. After injecting a series of Local anesthetic deep into the left jaw  he waited for 5 to 10 mts for it to take effect. He then proceeded with the 2 RCT in tandem which may have taken about 30 mins.He prescribed a 3 day course of painkillers and antibiotics after breakfast and dinner. 6th July evening was 24 hrs after the RCT was done, so the pain has subsided quite a bit and should steadily reduce each day. The Doctor will call me after a few days when the 2 crowns are ready.Col Sharma's Spa is Modern, well appointed, clean and hygienic. Most importantly, the toilet is spotlessly clean , hygienic and kept dry.If any one has a Dental problem, I would recommend Col Sharma.
