We are very sorry to hear about your experience.
According to our records its showing last you came for cleanup at 2019 and in 2021 march . 
Tooth cleaning or stain removal is recommended every 6 months to 1 year .
Stains are directly related to how much tea/coffee / green tea is consumed. Smoking also causes a lot of stains .
So it differs from patient to patient.
Looks like you have developed chromogenic bacteria ( repeated stain forming bacteria) 
We have a solution for this .
Please feel free to reach out to us , so we can find a process to work together for a solution of ur stains .",2021-08-09T08:02:19+0000,Dr. Sanjay N
