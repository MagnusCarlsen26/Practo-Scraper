"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"As a dentist myself, I hold high standards when it comes to dental care, and I can confidently say that Dr. Aarti Talkoti at Infinit Dental Solutions exceeded all expectations. I recently underwent implant prosthesis treatment at their clinic, and from start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional.

Dr. Talkoti's expertise and attention to detail were evident throughout the process. She took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, addressing my concerns and ensuring I felt comfortable every step of the way. Her professionalism, coupled with a warm and welcoming demeanour, immediately put me at ease.

Moreover, I was truly impressed by the state-of-the-art dental armamentarium available at Infinit Dental Solutions. The advanced technology and equipment utilized in my treatment contributed to the precision and accuracy of the results.

The final and permanent prosthesis that Dr. Talkoti crafted for me not only restored esthetics but also enhanced my overall oral health and functionality. I am beyond satisfied with the outcome and grateful for the skill and care provided by Dr. Talkoti.

I highly recommend Infinit Dental Solutions to anyone seeking top-notch dental care. Thank you, Dr. Aarti Talkoti, for your outstanding work and commitment to excel.
