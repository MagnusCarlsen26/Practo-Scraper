"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Crowns,",0,0,NO,"This is a continuation for the previously mentioned google review.

The essential point that both the clinic and everyone should understand is that a Google review is a platform for rating personal experiences and not a legal or medical authority for evaluating your practice. Each individual has the right to express their experience, and it is important to receive it positively rather than responding defensively by publicly displaying the patient's treatment procedure, which is not expected from a professional. It was hasty to immediately post the complete patient treatment procedure online in response to my review. As previously mentioned, since prompted by Google, I provided a rating based on my experience. My intention was to provide constructive feedback for the benefit of future patients and your practice. Unfortunately, it seems that my feedback was not received professionally. I am not discouraging others from visiting your clinic; it is their personal choice. However, since it seems acceptable to you to publicly post a patient's procedure, I feel compelled to share my detailed experience.

Two years ago, I had a root canal treatment (RCT). The tooth cap had been missing for the past 6-7 months, but I experienced no pain or discomfort. However, while chewing, the tooth broke due to the absence of a cap. Seeking a solution, I searched for a dentist on PRACTO, despite not experiencing any pain or discomfort at the time.

Day 1: I met with a junior doctor who informed me that the tooth was broken and needed to have the broken piece removed. I inquired about getting a new cap, to which they took an X-ray and confirmed it was possible. However, the doctor did not mention any broken instrument inside the tooth. This point is important to note. The doctor was polite and explained the procedure but failed to mention the presence of a broken instrument. After confirming with the doctor that a re-root canal treatment (Re RCT) was not necessary, I agreed to proceed with the cap installation. Consequently, I promptly provided a positive rating on PRACTO since everything seemed fine, and they actively sought reviews.

Day 6: I went for the cap fitting. Initially, the doctor mentioned that the cap wasn't fitting and attempted multiple times to adjust it. They even mentioned the possibility of redoing the procedure but eventually stated that it was fitting correctly. All the necessary adjustments were made, including correcting high points and performing a cleanup, which was satisfactory. The cap was installed, and the procedure was completed. The doctor assured me that everything went well and there would be no issues. Hence, I provided a positive rating on PRACTO.

Day 21: Severe pain persisted, leading me to visit the doctor again. They took an X-ray, which I have a backup photo of, and mentioned the presence of something broken inside the tooth. However, they dismissed it as the cause of the pain, attributing it to high points. They rectified the high points, prescribed antibiotics, and sent me home.

Day 24: The severe pain persisted, and a different doctor attended to me. They discovered a broken instrument inside and suggested informing the senior doctor. However, the senior doctor was absent from the clinic, so the X-ray photo was shared with him, indicating prior internal discussion. Suddenly, the senior doctor concluded that a surgery (Epicetomy) was necessary to remove the broken instrument. Since I had plans to leave town, I inquired if the procedure would address the problem. The doctor assured me that we could proceed immediately if needed and asked me to wait for his arrival. When the senior doctor arrived, he explained the Epicetomy procedure and emphasized that it was the only solution since the cap had already been installed. Despite the severity of the pain, a crucial conversation changed everything. I asked the doctor why the junior doctor hadn't mentioned the issue of the broken instrument earlier. The senior doctor's response was that sometimes broken pieces are left as they do not affect the procedure.
THIS REALIZATION HIT ME HARD. ***** ** *** ** ********** *** ******* ** ***** ****** ****** ** **** **** ** ******* the junior doctor should have clearly informed me about it on day 1 so I could make an informed decision. I did not desire a temporary solution; no one wants that. Consequently, I decided not to proceed with the procedure at that clinic.
Due to the intense pain, I sought help from another clinic. They conducted a comprehensive 3D scan and X-ray, identifying all the issues and providing a thorough consultation on possible procedures. Based on the new reports, here are the major issues with the previous treatment:

1.	The broken instrument issue was not communicated, ******** ******* **** ******** ******** ** ** ***** *** ** ********* ** *** ****. Sometimes, infections can be dormant and flare up due to biting force after installing new teeth crown. Regardless, they should have clearly informed me that this could happen since I hadn't had the cap for some time and that the root canal could flare up at any time. This information would have helped me make a better decision.
2.	There is an overhang portion in the crown that was installed, which explains the issue on day 6. Additionally, the crown was not properly contoured. Consequently, I now have to remove it, ***** *** *** ***** ** **** *** *****.
3.	Composite material was placed between the teeth to adjust the overhang, *** ** ** *** ******** *** ********* *** ****** *** *** **** ** ***** ***********

This is my overall experience. Readers can review it and make their own decisions, being cautious when undergoing their own treatment procedures. Overall, the junior doctors were polite and doing their best, but the lack of detailed consultation and rushing into the treatment resulted in significant problems. A thorough consultation always helps patients to think and decide. I have confidence that you will approach this feedback in a positive manner and make efforts to enhance the patient experience.",2023-05-19 12:19:21,False,False,Arjun Nambiar,"Even patient should take the reply or justification given by us in a positive manner .please note the difference between justification and defensive .your reports haven't been publicity published .only you have been updated what u have undergone at our clinic.
sticking to your words like how you had mentioned like you we even have rights to express.
we behaved professionally so we came back with a reply for you so you could understand what exactly happened .
will update all your queries in point so nothing should be missed out 
1)
as u agreed 2 years back you had undergone RCT elsewhere and MOST important point as u have mentioned you having no PAIN or DISCOMFORT .
( as you mentioned 
I searched for a dentist on PRACTO, despite not experiencing any pain or discomfort at the time)
Another point sir the Dr you keep mentioning as junior DR has experience of 7 years.
Anyways x ray was taken not because u wanted to undergo a new crown .X Ray was taken to find out if the Old RCT was done properly or not .After x ray was taken Dr had clearly informed you about the broken instrument and the discontinuity of the gutta percha and the need for RERCT and if needed apicectomy , The reason that you repeatedly stuck to saying  i have no pain since 2 years u denied for getting the above said procedures and went ahead only with the crown .
for 7 month without crown u kept on using the tooth which eventually fractured and we had to build it up doing post and core followed by a crown  .
you stuck with the same point that when i had no pain since 2 years why will pain occur now so at most we can explain about the same but wont force a patient if he/ she  isn't willing to go for it . 
I took time to reply to this since i wanted to talk with my Dr first and she has clearly told everything was told to you initially on the first day itself .why you are still denying this point god only knows .
(As you mentioned clearly mentioning as Day 1 
 After confirming with the doctor that a re-root canal treatment (Re RCT) was not necessary, I agreed to proceed with the cap installation ).
re Rct is only mentioned when previous RCT wasn't performed properly or any broken files was detected which cause pain or any kind of discomfort.
so this clearly means that broken file was mentioned to you so from that only was the talk regarding RE RCT WAS SPOKEN ABOUT.
As i previously mentioned that since u were adamant about not having pain for 2 years u were pretty sure yourself that u wont have pain now also.
so on you request u went ahead with the crown . 
( as you mentioned  I promptly provided a positive rating on PRACTO since everything seemed fine, and they actively sought reviews )
firstly we never asked for any reviews and on rely on patients giving themselves once they are satisficed with the treatment .another point to be noticed is when you removed the review too we never asked you the reason for doing so also .we leave reviews up to the patients .our clinic is there from 9 years and if you see on google there are only 253 reviews till date. this should clarify the point that we don't ask for reviews.
 ( as you mentioned the doctor mentioned that the cap wasn't fitting and attempted multiple times to adjust it )
on your 2nd visit only the crown was fitted with some minor adjustments .tooth tends to move so at tyms some adjustments are needed .
Redoing the crown and not the procedure incase if crown has too much fitting issues .this is because we want perfection in the work we do even if it means material wastage from our side .
(As you mentioned  They took an X-ray, which I have a backup photo of, and mentioned the presence of something broken inside the tooth. However, they dismissed it as the cause of the pain, attributing it to high points)
you were already informed about the main reason for the persistent pain due to broken file .high point adjustment was just to make sure that excess pressure wasn't applied on the tooth .in your case even reduction was done to a point where there was no occlusion between tooth's .even after all this u weren't even ready to listen about the point regarding the broken file from the first .
(as you mentioned They discovered a broken instrument inside and suggested informing the senior doctor )
the senior Dr was informed from day 1 itself but since u weren't ready for the procedure no appt was booked for the procedure .Eventually u visited the clinic and agreed for the procedure on which basis the Dr came and explained you everything and still didn't undergo the procedure citing some reasons and planned for the procedure next day for which u cancelled it .
the Dr had clearly mentioned everything since day 1 now if the patient is in denial mode nothing much we can do .you urself have agreed and stated that rerct wasn't needed on the first day .the topic of rerct had come because of updating you about the broken files .your own statements contradict you sir .
you have got a comprehensive 3D scan which was not all needed when the 2d RVG clearly shows the problem .but its your wish what u want to do we have no say in this matter .
(as you mentioned clearly informed me that this could happen since I hadn't had the cap for some time and that the root canal could flare up at any time)
this was clearly informed to you in the first visit itself but since u had this thought no pain since 2 years why would it now and didn't want anything to be done except the crown .
the Dr also clearly informed you that after crown placement along with post the pressure would lead to pain eventually and u will need to undergo the procedures for which you said lets see when it happen .as I said we can only advise the patient and not force him . 
(as you mentioned  overhang portion in the crown that was installed, which explains the issue on day 6. Additionally, the crown was not properly contoured )
a crown never over hangs .its margins are extended if there is interdental bone loss if not there would be food impaction leading to gingivitis and re infection .if crown isn't contoured properly wouldn't have  fitted in the first place .
even we do have the x rays after crown fixation where no issues are seen .
(as you mentioned , I now have to remove it )
a very simple question to you sir 
if you had issues with the crown or with the fitting we were always ready to help you .you even had a warranty for 10 years and if you wanted for your convenience we would have gladly replaced the crown .
we contacted you also but u kept disconnecting the calls so we didn't want to bother you further .
(as you mentioned  Composite material was placed between the teeth to adjust the overhang )
please understand the procedure done firstly before commenting .
composite was done while post cementation before crown was fixed .during crown preparation all excess composite is trimmed to get the margins for the crown .then only is the crown cemented on the core structure .
so please explain to us that how is it possible to place composite after crown was cemented onto the tooth surface .
the purpose of this detailed reply was for readers to know how treatments are planned and every detail is communicated with the patients from our side based on which the  correct procedure and proper treatment protocol is followed .
detailed consultation was done after the x-ray was taken and reviewed .each and every point was clearly mentioned to you .there was no rushing from our side from the start and after u said us to go ahead with the crown procedure bypassing the other mentioned procedures relying on the fact that since 2 years u had no pain.
Even we have confidence that you will approach this reply in a positive manner and make efforts to understand the importance of correct diagnosis given by us  .

"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Braces Fixing,Braces Adjustment,",0,0,NO,mixed experience personally. expected to give better suggestion keeping current dental status and overall cost in mind. *********** ***** *****,2021-02-15 16:42:32,False,False,balendu vidyarthi,"Better suggestions is when u listen to what the Dr suggest you and not plan urself what best for you so can save money .
You had started your Braces Treatment else where and within months u suggested for Second Opinion even after your treatment was started .You were busy Blaming your First Doctor itself who treated you and wanted to continue else where .
Before  Braces treatment is suggested its always Mandatory to Take an X ray (OPG) to plan the treatment which was never taken .
On that basis Dr had suggested you for an X ray which according to you was waste of money. 
Even a 2nd Appt was.fixed for you to decide the treatment  plan along with the X ray if Old Braves were to removed or to start Fresh from the start .
For which u never turned up and ur first appt was.in the month of Dec 2020.Infact you had sent a Message saying u wont be able to come for the appt due to whatso Reasons. 
Dr planned the next step of treatment based on X ray reports and fixed the Next appointment based on that .
Now whether you go ahead or not with the treatment this entirely upto you. 
Seems You were suggesting the Dr that u paid for the Braces from you first Dr and were insisting Dr to continue with the same .
We don't listen to patients treatment plan based on your comfort of saving money. Brcaes placed were not Correct and on what basis do you think we will do such baseless treatment so in the end you will have the say telling your the Dr why did you listen to patients .
Such Review dont matter to us or our patients who have Faith in our suggestion. 
If u really want to save money and get things done underpar then better u should visit a dental college or some Govt hospital since we don't  charge unreasonably and for good material and service provided its does have a cost. 
We do take negative reviews seriously but not at the cost that u expect us to treat you in unethical manner and as per your wish .
