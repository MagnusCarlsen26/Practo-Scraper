,,0,0,YES,"Hi, I visited Dentin clinic for persistent gum infection, root canal treatment, dental bridge and dental implant.
I highly recommend Dentin clinic as it has been my best experience so far, after receiving treatment in 5 different clinics before, including 3 in BLR.
* Appointments are quite hassle free and flexible, with minimal wait time.
* Doctors (especially Dr. Gaurav) are very understanding to the patient needs, and suggest various applicable options with pros and cons so that you can make a choice best suited to you.
* very clean, hygienic and lively environment.

I had visited for multiple issues, and the end result is absolutely satisfactory, much beyond my own expectations, with completely natural appearance of denture, and gums like they have never been healthier before. Money worth spent. No issues so far after almost a year.
Many thanks to Dr. Gaurav and his team, and Dr. Kaushik as well.",2020-06-20 17:53:04,False,True,Shilpi,,,

,"Bleeding Gums Treatment,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Found slightly costly in terms of treatment cost but the advice was sound. Also the clinic is setup really nicely. I got cleaning done. I generally pay 1k to 1.2k. Here i paid 1.5k. They did it very well and their equipment was good so i think that extra 300-400 makes sense.

I have deducted 1 star for below reason.

He recommended a procedure instead of extraction. I am not sure if he genuinely thinks it will work or a way to make easy 2k. Though his advice might be very well right",2023-11-13 06:48:58,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
