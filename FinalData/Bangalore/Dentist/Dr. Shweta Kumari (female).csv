As I have plans to relocate from the country, there were multiple serious issues concerning my tooth , hence the extensive and prolonged services provided by Dr. Shweta and her expert team is truly commendable. The detailed vigilance, the acute precision, taking X-rays and validating the procedure accuracy, being too caring in regards to pain & sensitivity both towards my fears & tooth situation, everything was really done to perfection. Post treatment care was also performed with due diligence. Time was one of the crucial factor that should be highlighted. She is very punctual and the clinic is very well equipped with all the latest technology. 
I would sincerely highly recommend to avail & attend Dr. Shweta’s clinic as her services is a benchmark in this professional world. Thank You Dr. ",2020-01-02 05:59:39,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

When you are scared and in pain you want to be dealt with accordingly not hear stories",2021-05-11 21:30:47,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hi
In regard to your complaint, would like to explain few things..
1. As you have mentioned, you had wisdom tooth issues , and yes wisdom tooth is an extra tooth so the permanent solution for impaction of wisdom tooth is extraction( removal) only that we suggested as  we don't believe in any quick fix but permanent solution of problem.Your pain was primarily because of wisdom tooth so we were insisting on that, as we also don't want a prolonged treatment for a patient in this covid times ( many visits to clinic).
Again wisdom tooth problem involves defenitely an extraction as permanent solution as it is an extra tooth. 
2.we did not find any cavities and we adhere with our diagnosis as food can be stuck in many places, even between two teeth with gaps.When there is no cavities , only discoloration we just can't label it as cavities and do filling.That kind of unethical work we don't do.
Thanks",2021-05-13T08:15:33+0000,Dr. Shweta Kumari
