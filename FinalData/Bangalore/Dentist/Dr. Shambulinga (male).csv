"Value for money,Treatment satisfaction,","Composite tooth filling,Dental Cleaning,Dental Checkup (General),",0,0,NO,"This was my first visit to a dentist in Bangalore and I purposely kept it discreet that I have a dentist family member. As expected, the dentist didnt even check with us if we needed the cleaning or filling or something else!
The problem was in right tooth and in his excitement he also cleaned the left tooth.
Now what did he clean on the left side???
It was a cavity filling done earlier. So if its a permanent cavity filling, why did he remove it?? Just to fill up again so that he could bill more!!!

The end of story is, we went with one problem of right side, now we are sitting with pain on both sides!!
Biggest problem with this doctor is - he doesn't listen *** **** ******* **** ** ****** ******** ",2023-07-27 12:55:41,False,False,Verified Patient,Hello there was no filling hollow cavity inside & showed u before filling & ask to take xray u never did that u go on writing review every were prepare urself first to take the treatment.
