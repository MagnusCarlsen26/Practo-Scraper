I was thoroughly explained all the options. Finally took call for dislocation as per situation.\nI got my teeth cleaned & polished. It took 20 min and it was one of the smoothest processes I have sat through.\n\nThe ambience is so relaxing.\nThe staff is also very very helpful. I'm so glad I decided on going through with my treatment with her.\n\nFor one of the visits, doctor had to wait for 1.5 hours as I got in bad traffic. Thank you and really impressive gesture ",

But then I started getting immense pain in that tooth. At the same time, I was having issues with my wisdom tooth. So I contacted Dr. Arunima Chandra over the Practo app, after which she explained to me what would be the right way to fix these problems and asked me to set up an appointment. \n\nAn RCT and Wisdom tooth extraction procedures were planned. I was extremely anxious and scared (I have been since a child). But let me tell you, I had the most relaxed appointments with Dr. Arunima. The extraction was seamless and pain-free. She also made sure to check on me post-treatment. After that, she scheduled me for an RCT treatment, which required about 2-3 appointments (for my case). I am writing this review after the completion of all of my procedures since I am extremely satisfied with the efforts that were put in by the doctor and her staff during COVID. Reasons being: \n1) She listens to your problems patiently and suggests you all the possible routes you can opt for to get it fixed. She helped me big time to calm myself down and I am extremely thankful for it.\n2) They wore masks and the doctor wore PPE kit as well while treating a patient.\n3) The waiting period is not more than 10 mins (EVER).\n4) The clinic looks extremely neat and clean and is quite spacious to socially distance yourself from other patients. \n5) The care that she takes while and after treatment is something I have never received from my previous dentists.\n6) The cost of the treatments are absolutely nominal compared to other dentists I have been to.\n\nThanks again, Dr. Arunima Chandra. \n",

I was thoroughly explained all the options. Finally took call for dislocation as per situation.\nI got my teeth cleaned & polished. It took 20 min and it was one of the smoothest processes I have sat through.\n\nThe ambience is so relaxing.\nThe staff is also very very helpful. I'm so glad I decided on going through with my treatment with her.\n\nFor one of the visits, doctor had to wait for 1.5 hours as I got in bad traffic. Thank you and really impressive gesture ",

But then I started getting immense pain in that tooth. At the same time, I was having issues with my wisdom tooth. So I contacted Dr. Arunima Chandra over the Practo app, after which she explained to me what would be the right way to fix these problems and asked me to set up an appointment. \n\nAn RCT and Wisdom tooth extraction procedures were planned. I was extremely anxious and scared (I have been since a child). But let me tell you, I had the most relaxed appointments with Dr. Arunima. The extraction was seamless and pain-free. She also made sure to check on me post-treatment. After that, she scheduled me for an RCT treatment, which required about 2-3 appointments (for my case). I am writing this review after the completion of all of my procedures since I am extremely satisfied with the efforts that were put in by the doctor and her staff during COVID. Reasons being: \n1) She listens to your problems patiently and suggests you all the possible routes you can opt for to get it fixed. She helped me big time to calm myself down and I am extremely thankful for it.\n2) They wore masks and the doctor wore PPE kit as well while treating a patient.\n3) The waiting period is not more than 10 mins (EVER).\n4) The clinic looks extremely neat and clean and is quite spacious to socially distance yourself from other patients. \n5) The care that she takes while and after treatment is something I have never received from my previous dentists.\n6) The cost of the treatments are absolutely nominal compared to other dentists I have been to.\n\nThanks again, Dr. Arunima Chandra. \n",
