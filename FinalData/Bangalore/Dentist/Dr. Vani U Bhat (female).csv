,,0,0,YES,"Root Canal and Dental Crown procedure

I was suffering from facial nerve pain and had to undergo a root canal and dental crown procedure on the same side as my Neuralgia. During multiple sittings, Dr. Vani expertly performed the procedure with skill and patience that my anxiety about nerve pain getting triggered was unfounded.

I strongly recommend WhiteZ Dental for any dental treatment that you may require.

,,0,0,YES,"She is an amazing doctor who has lot of patience and helped me clean my teeth and gave me just right recommendation which actually helped made my teeth and gums related problems solve. Not only that she actually called me a week later to understand how I was doing and if the problem was solved and that whether I was feeling better or do I needed help.
It is very difficult to find such dentists in these days. I would recommend Dr. Vani for anyone who has dental issues.",2023-06-06 03:10:19,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
