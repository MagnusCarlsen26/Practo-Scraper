However, the tooth pain did not reduce and i messaged him about it around 8.30 PM. He responded immediately to my message and understood my pain and arrange for root canal treatment by 10.pm as the expert was engaged with other patient. I reached his clinic around 10 and with in 30-40 min the expert did excellent surgical procedure and i was absolutely fine after that with no pain. It is highly difficult to find professionals like this. Of note, the hygienic they follow during this pandemic  is highly appreciated. \nThank you",

Every time for my dental issues I used to visit him, on one of my follow up visits to him, I was told he had set up his own clinic. I did not get his contact details from the clinic nor could I find his contact details on the Internet. So, I started visiting other dentists for my dental issues, but could not find any Dentist who gave the treatment like Dr Chiranjeevi Reddy. So I decided to look for Dr Chiranjeevi Reddy again.\nThanks to Practo, I could get Dr Reddy's contact details in 2019. I was very happy to get his contact details and more happier when I visited him and got the treatment. Even after 9yrs he could recognize me.\nAbout his new clinic,\n1.\tHis staff is very courteous and as professional as Dr Reddy\n2.\tAll your calls to the clinic are answered. Missed calls are promptly returned by the staff\n3.\tAppointments are honored. Also very minimal waiting time\n4.\tAll doctors at the clinic are very helpful.\n5.\tYou get advice according to your dental condition and not according to cost of the treatment\n6.\tCost of treatment is reasonably priced.\n7.\tClinic is very neatly and cleanly maintained\n\nThis clinic is ideal for anyone having Dental issues and I strongly recommend you consider this clinic for your dental treatment.\n",
