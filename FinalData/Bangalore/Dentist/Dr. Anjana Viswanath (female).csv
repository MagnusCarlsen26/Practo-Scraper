None,None,0,0,YES,"A month before the start of the lockdown, I had visited a reputable and trustworthy dentist that I had been visiting for years regarding a very small cavity that I wanted to be fixed. On consulting, it was indicated to me that I required the extraction of a wisdom tooth and the tooth that was bothering me was drilled into and filled up. Fast forward a few weeks after all of these procedures when the lockdown was in full force, I started experiencing severe, paralyzing pain in my ear that radiated through my head. On consulting an ENT, I was directed to have a dentist analyze the issue. As much as I tried, I was unable to reach the doctor that worked on my teeth and was then informed of Dr Anjana by a friend who was one of her previous patients.
On calling her, I was pleasantly surprised by her promptness and once I got off the phone with her, I was left feeling relieved and comforted. She immediately understood my concerns and dealt with them in a manner that was serious but simultaneously alleviated my intense worry. 
After a couple of weeks of constant online check-ins, she had me take an x-ray and consulted me in person (all the required safety precautions were observed) where we discovered that while drilling, the root of the tooth was touched and a filling was performed over the aggravation which only caused more damage and lead to the formation of a severe abscess, rendering the tooth dead. Through all the procedures that followed, Dr Anjana and her team were extremely prompt with following up, checking in and graciously answered any and all questions and concerns that I had. This situation of the pandemic had left me feeling helpless but Dr Anjana was constantly available and spontaneous. To say that I am satisfied and grateful would be an extreme understatement.",2021-06-04 14:25:50,False,True,Aparna C,Thanks for taking the time to give me such a datailed feedback Aparna.
