Pearly white teeth are often bitten by dark cavities. Treatment of these may involve just restoring it with a good filling or treating the entire tooth, to not only remove the decay but also the infection. The myth that clouds the complex root canal treatment is that it is painful and an unpleasant experience. Endodontists with their expertise in root canal treatment not only ensure better success rates but also ensure that it is almost painless.
