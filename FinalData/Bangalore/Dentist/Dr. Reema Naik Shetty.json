She recommended filling the cavity and went on to do it in a very professional way. I strongly recommend Dr. Reema for any dental issues. I found her very polite and extremely professional.",

I have always had slight tooth pain for years, but was ignoring it thinking it to be just sensitivity to cold. But this time the pain was strong and affected my daily life. I visited her in the last week of November, and I wanted to make sure my tooth was treated before my wedding in mid December. Madam closely observed me and declared that I needed root canal, as there was considerable decay and caries in tooth 46. In 3 sittings within 8 days, Madam completed the entire surgery and capping process. I observed during the treatment, she was always very careful not to hurt me too much, and very considerate of any discomfort I might have felt. I was comfortable from start to finish, ofcourse with the slight natural pain of a surgery, but the anesthesia that Madam applied, really really helped. I returned back to my hometown for my wedding, and since then haven't felt even an iota of pain or discomfort. I want to thank Madam from the bottom of my heart, and declare that doctors like Reema Madam are amazing assets to the society, and elevate the patient doctor experience to a supreme level!",

This made me feel comfortable and I lost my general fear towards dentists.  Every procedure she would explain what she is going to do and what sort of pain and how much, I am going to feel and how I  should cope with it.  She would carefully explain what medcines I should take before coming for the session and the type of medicines to be taken afterwards.  She is capable in instilling in her patients a high level of confidence. \nI thank he for doing giving me an excellent treatment  to my  complicated situation.  I wish that she grows Godspeed in her profession bringing relief  to those suffering from dental ailments.  I would certainly recommedn Dr.Reema Naik Shety to all my friends.",

I have always had slight tooth pain for years, but was ignoring it thinking it to be just sensitivity to cold. But this time the pain was strong and affected my daily life. I visited her in the last week of November, and I wanted to make sure my tooth was treated before my wedding in mid December. Madam closely observed me and declared that I needed root canal, as there was considerable decay and caries in tooth 46. In 3 sittings within 8 days, Madam completed the entire surgery and capping process. I observed during the treatment, she was always very careful not to hurt me too much, and very considerate of any discomfort I might have felt. I was comfortable from start to finish, ofcourse with the slight natural pain of a surgery, but the anesthesia that Madam applied, really really helped. I returned back to my hometown for my wedding, and since then haven't felt even an iota of pain or discomfort. I want to thank Madam from the bottom of my heart, and declare that doctors like Reema Madam are amazing assets to the society, and elevate the patient doctor experience to a supreme level!",

Generally I am always reluctant in approaching a dentist since I find the drilling sound very disturbing. \n\nWhen I visited Dr.Reema Shetty, by appointment through Practo she welcomed me and  engaged me into a most friendly conversation as if she had known me for long.  This made me feel comfortable and I lost my general fear towards dentists.  Every procedure she would explain what she is going to do and what sort of pain and how much, I am going to feel and how I  should cope with it.  She would carefully explain what medcines I should take before coming for the session and the type of medicines to be taken afterwards.  She is capable in instilling in her patients a high level of confidence. \nI thank he for doing giving me an excellent treatment  to my  complicated situation.  I wish that she grows Godspeed in her profession bringing relief  to those suffering from dental ailments.  I would certainly recommedn Dr.Reema Naik Shety to all my friends.",
