Thank you for the feedback, We would like to clarify on few things as the information you have provided are not correct.

Your RCT was done on March 2020(around 2 years ago) and you were informed about the possible future infection because of the adjacent tooth(malalignment). As per the current situation, you are having pain due to food lodgement between the treated tooth and the adjacent tooth for which we planned a consultation with the prosthodontist and decide further treatment plan, we never suggested ReRCT at the first place. Our focus is always to provide quality and best possible treatment.

You had also visited us on April 2021 for full mouth cleaning and did not have any complaint or discomfort.

Our priority is and will always be patient satisfaction and we will be more than happy to provide you the best treatment possible.

Team Dental Hub values your opinion and always take all the feedback very seriously as we strive for a better experience for the patients. However, we strongly oppose such allegations of not being transparent. 100+ positive feedbacks from satisfied customers are proof of that. We have been in this business for over 6 years now and have always maintained a transparent and justified charging system of the treatment provided.

You were clearly explained everything during consultation with 2 x-rays of 2 different parts of your mouth to get seriousness of the cavity. You were told that you can opt for cleaning before going for filling (which will be done next day). You even called your husband and then only confirmed that you want to get the cleaning done. A simple NO would have avoided your dissatisfaction. All the charges for consultation, x-rays, cleaning and filling were told before proceeding and we went ahead only after your confirmation (and your husband's). As we value the customer we just charged for one x-ray. 

The filling was done next day as promised. We take pride in our services would like to inform others reading the feedback to visit the clinic and experience our services firsthand. You editing your feedback thrice speaks volume about the confusion you have regarding how you want to bring the whole thing in a bad light. We hope you are feeling much better after the treatment and we would always be available to help you in any way possible in future as well.

Thanks and regards,
Team Dental Hub",2020-02-04T16:02:19+0000,Dr. Nita Kashyap
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Toothache,Dental Cavities,",0,0,NO,we went for my son dental check up. Doctor dont have patience. Didn't explain the procedure. No Fiendliness. Sure I won't recommend this doctor,2020-01-12 01:12:59,False,False,Verified Patient,"Dear Patient,

Thank you for feedback. We have tried our best to provide you the best treatment and followed our best practices during the whole process. There are certain things that are out of our control. Your kid started screaming and crying during the consultation itself on 30th Nov (when we didn't even start the treatment) and you were not able to stop him and let us talk. Still the doctor managed and explained you the whole process and cost but you still wanted the doctor to explain the procedure and cost on your next visit this month, which we did gladly again.

Your son was not ready to sit in the chair, let alone start the treatment, and we spent around 45 minutes just to calm him. You were clearly told if your son is not able to cooperate we will have to ask a child specialist (pedodontist) for which charges will be extra but you were not ready for that too. 

Even after 2 visits for consultation you haven't paid the full amount (Rs 300) and for treatment which we started and spent 45 minutes of effort you did not pay anything.

We as The Dental Hub team try our best to ensure a smooth process and treatment where everything is explained in advance and the patient feels comfortable. If you are ready to get a pedodontist examine and treat your child you can visit the clinic again and I'm sure we will be able to change your view.
