Lingual CAD/CAM braces has been helping me in the following ways:

1) Best aesthetics in orthodontic treatment as the braces are completely invisible.
2) Easy recognition of ongoing teeth treatment by me (amateur and not only just orthodontists) as the braces is totally on the lingual side.
3) I did not undergo any soreness/ulcer inside my lips unlike with the use of conventional braces. (I only experienced minor ulcer at the back of my tongue, which was immediately taken care by Dr Ameet Kini as he provided the necessary ointment and medication)
4) Slurry speech (due to braces) was corrected within 4-5 days automatically.
5) Customized brackets and robot wiring is helping in the teeth movement better than the conventional braces (because of the sophisticated technology used) without compromising on the time lapse as it remains same as conventional braces.
6) I have been undergoing 4 months of treatment now and a big shout out to Dr Ameet Kini as the results also have been going in the same direction as the results of any other conventional braces.

But extreme careful maintenance is required as it involves customized brackets for each individual and it requires time to repair/replace in case the bracket is fallen off/broken.

Dr Ameet Kini has been extremely professional and friendly, has been helping me out with the smooth treatment and answering all my queries regarding diet, maintenance of oral hygiene and the appliance.

On the first visit he clearly laid out treatment options and helped me to choose one that best suited my budget and time. He also didnt add any extra unnecessary treatments.
This is very important to mention because 
A dentist I had visited prior to him told me I needed to remove a ""dead tooth and gave me only two options the prohibitively expensive invisaligners and braces which I didnt want to go through again. I was very relieved to know that I didn't have to get any teeth pulled out before starting the treatment.
