Bleeding gums happens due to tartar deposits in between  gums and teeth, ie; above and below the gum line.If one doesn't visit a dentist for professional cleaning on time,every six months,the deposits gets further accumulated which releases irritants to the gums and the gums starts getting inflammed and starts receding and pulling away from the teeth and the gums eventually starts bleeding...when you delay your visit for cleaning by any dental professional including us, the damage has already happened to your gums and bones supporting the gums.While scaling)cleaning we remove the irritant/the tartar deposit which is stuck between the teeth and gums which is more or less like a cement in between bricks...Tartar deposits are always more in between front teeth due to accumulation of saliva in front part of our mouth.Calcium in our saliva ,mixes with plaque and gets deposited as a white/green coloured powdery cement which is called as tartar)calculus...
When we remove it during professional scaling the area occupied by  tartar in between the teeth is cleared and thus gap appears between teeth....after scaling, 50 percent of gum recession gets repaired in due course of time,but whatever damage has happened due to delay in treatment on time remains.
All these aspects are thoroughly explained to all our patients before the procedure.
