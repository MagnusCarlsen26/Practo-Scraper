                "review_text": "I went to another dentist about a month prior to my first appointment here. That place seemed so new and and was not very happy with the fact that within a minute all my treatments were chalked out. So I gave up initially and then another bit of my tooth cracked which is when I got a little worried. Found Dr.Sodhi by location on practo and called her immediately and it was almost instant that I felt rather comfortable. I asked her if i could ask her two questions and then went on to ask another one at which point she reminded me jovially that this was my third question.. So it started out quite well and when I went in for the appointment she took her time understanding my concerns and the fact that although I wanted this done I also wanted to be a little comfortable with the entire plan. She mentioned that I needed quite a few cavities filled and in between I had got into the the habit of chewing pan masala which had also stained my teeth and that needed to be taken care off as well and also my tooth needed a root canal. So all in all would take a while and she wanted to know what my pain levels were and so we started with basic cavities filling. And she is extremely patient..The number of times I've had her stop because it hit a sensitive stop and she just patiently waited joking that she would charge me more( she never did in case you are wondering). But it also goes to show that she is not doing this just for the heck of it but because she cares for her patients. The root canal treatment took slightly longer due to my work schedules but that was also very well done. When my gums hurt or whatever that feeling was she took her time to explain that it is that area being adjusted with the cap that she had placed.. Really really good. My pain is all gone and my teeth feel amazing. She also went out of her way to try and help me quit smoking because it is not only spoiling my teeth but more importantly my health. Showed me so many different avenues. But I'm still having trouble with the quit. That obviously isn't the doctors fault but my lack of willingness to quit. Only mentioned this because she will not only look at her job at hand but will also take interest in making you feel like a comfortable patient. Well, at least that was my experience and I can safely say that when my dad finally decided to get his teeth filled I will be bringing him here and when anyone wants a dentists recommendation this would be the place. I am comfortable here and I would happily travel the distance to get to this place if I were to ever shift from where I stay at the moment. Thank you Dr. Sodhi. \n\nPS: In case I have not mentioned it yet.. the clinic is extremely clean and the rest of the staff are amazing. The music is peaceful and all in all a great place.",

                "review_text": "\u201cMy profession does not excuse me\u201d- this sentence by Dr. Aman Sodhi during our interaction is a gist to explain her dedication towards profession. However, elaborating my experience during and after the dental treatment explains the service blueprint of the treatment process. I had one of my tooth filling in quadrant-3 molar tooth fallen/ chipped of during COVID-19 lockdown, had no other option but to postpone the treatment. Over a period of time, the tooth had infected beyond regular filling and it needed \u201cRoot Canal Treatment\u201d (at this point I was so paranoid, that I gave a thought of not getting the treatment). With no option left; agreed for a \u201cRoot Canal Treatment\u201d half heartedly. I have seen both my parents getting RCT and both of them had bad experiences and lot of pain during the procedure. Dr. Aman ensured, RCT will not pain and assured she would take care and nothing to worry. I was very paranoid as the  RCT procedure was about to begin, Kudos to the patience of Dr. Aman (haven\u2019t seen a doctor as patient as she is); she was very cautious and patient throughout the process. She explained me about the process during treatment and also prepared me (this made me aware of what is about to come).  Dr. Aman used to crack jokes and put me into a conversation to divert my attention during the treatment so that I don\u2019t think of pain and be aware of the process. In the end RCT, went well; however it was not the easy one for Dr. Aman - there were 4 canines in the tooth and it took longer for her to finish; may be she would have finished it in 2 visits, but to my paranoid attitude she took 4 clinic visits to finish the process. Dr. Aman is hands on in judging the situation and understanding the problem - also she resolves the problem with best solution. \n\nNow, I blindly trust Dr. Aman and follow her instructions when it about my dental health, though I got couple of my dental fillings redone after RCT treatment, the first experience is always a laying stone for future. Now I recommend all my loved ones to go to Dr. Aman for dental treatment.\nThe entire team of Dental Solutions clinic are dedicated and true to service.",

I had already extracted a wisdom tooth earlier which was traumatic, so I was very scared for another extraction more so because the tooth was impacted, but Dr. Aman made me understand every step and ensured an easy extraction, and which indeed was. But due to impacted tooth my next vital tooth also got already damaged and infected and it gave me pain like nightmares. Kudos to Dr.Aman and her team who took care of me like a child, because I was too much sensitive to the pain. For more than a month and six sittings multiple times for my RCT she explained everything in very understable terms and did procedure with utmost care. She was very patient and compassionate throughout. Now the cap is also placed and I must say that it is perfectly fine now. *** ** *** **** ******* ** ********* **** * friendly and humanitarian attitude and with a smile always on her face. **** ****** ******* Thank you Doctor for bringing my smile back !!",

That place seemed so new and and was not very happy with the fact that within a minute all my treatments were chalked out. So I gave up initially and then another bit of my tooth cracked which is when I got a little worried. Found Dr.Sodhi by location on practo and called her immediately and it was almost instant that I felt rather comfortable. I asked her if i could ask her two questions and then went on to ask another one at which point she reminded me jovially that this was my third question.. So it started out quite well and when I went in for the appointment she took her time understanding my concerns and the fact that although I wanted this done I also wanted to be a little comfortable with the entire plan. She mentioned that I needed quite a few cavities filled and in between I had got into the the habit of chewing pan masala which had also stained my teeth and that needed to be taken care off as well and also my tooth needed a root canal. So all in all would take a while and she wanted to know what my pain levels were and so we started with basic cavities filling. And she is extremely patient..The number of times I've had her stop because it hit a sensitive stop and she just patiently waited joking that she would charge me more( she never did in case you are wondering). But it also goes to show that she is not doing this just for the heck of it but because she cares for her patients. The root canal treatment took slightly longer due to my work schedules but that was also very well done. When my gums hurt or whatever that feeling was she took her time to explain that it is that area being adjusted with the cap that she had placed.. Really really good. My pain is all gone and my teeth feel amazing. She also went out of her way to try and help me quit smoking because it is not only spoiling my teeth but more importantly my health. Showed me so many different avenues. But I'm still having trouble with the quit. That obviously isn't the doctors fault but my lack of willingness to quit. Only mentioned this because she will not only look at her job at hand but will also take interest in making you feel like a comfortable patient. Well, at least that was my experience and I can safely say that when my dad finally decided to get his teeth filled I will be bringing him here and when anyone wants a dentists recommendation this would be the place. I am comfortable here and I would happily travel the distance to get to this place if I were to ever shift from where I stay at the moment. Thank you Dr. Sodhi. \n\nPS: In case I have not mentioned it yet.. the clinic is extremely clean and the rest of the staff are amazing. The music is peaceful and all in all a great place.",

                "review_text": "\u201cMy profession does not excuse me\u201d- this sentence by Dr. Aman Sodhi during our interaction is a gist to explain her dedication towards profession. However, elaborating my experience during and after the dental treatment explains the service blueprint of the treatment process. I had one of my tooth filling in quadrant-3 molar tooth fallen/ chipped of during COVID-19 lockdown, had no other option but to postpone the treatment. Over a period of time, the tooth had infected beyond regular filling and it needed \u201cRoot Canal Treatment\u201d (at this point I was so paranoid, that I gave a thought of not getting the treatment). With no option left; agreed for a \u201cRoot Canal Treatment\u201d half heartedly. I have seen both my parents getting RCT and both of them had bad experiences and lot of pain during the procedure. Dr. Aman ensured, RCT will not pain and assured she would take care and nothing to worry. I was very paranoid as the  RCT procedure was about to begin, Kudos to the patience of Dr. Aman (haven\u2019t seen a doctor as patient as she is); she was very cautious and patient throughout the process. She explained me about the process during treatment and also prepared me (this made me aware of what is about to come).  Dr. Aman used to crack jokes and put me into a conversation to divert my attention during the treatment so that I don\u2019t think of pain and be aware of the process. In the end RCT, went well; however it was not the easy one for Dr. Aman - there were 4 canines in the tooth and it took longer for her to finish; may be she would have finished it in 2 visits, but to my paranoid attitude she took 4 clinic visits to finish the process. Dr. Aman is hands on in judging the situation and understanding the problem - also she resolves the problem with best solution. \n\nNow, I blindly trust Dr. Aman and follow her instructions when it about my dental health, though I got couple of my dental fillings redone after RCT treatment, the first experience is always a laying stone for future. Now I recommend all my loved ones to go to Dr. Aman for dental treatment.\nThe entire team of Dental Solutions clinic are dedicated and true to service.",

I had already extracted a wisdom tooth earlier which was traumatic, so I was very scared for another extraction more so because the tooth was impacted, but Dr. Aman made me understand every step and ensured an easy extraction, and which indeed was. But due to impacted tooth my next vital tooth also got already damaged and infected and it gave me pain like nightmares. Kudos to Dr.Aman and her team who took care of me like a child, because I was too much sensitive to the pain. For more than a month and six sittings multiple times for my RCT she explained everything in very understable terms and did procedure with utmost care. She was very patient and compassionate throughout. Now the cap is also placed and I must say that it is perfectly fine now. *** ** *** **** ******* ** ********* **** * friendly and humanitarian attitude and with a smile always on her face. **** ****** ******* Thank you Doctor for bringing my smile back !!",

The Kids too love her as she is extremely friendly and explains every aspect in detail winning their trust and confidence. We as a family look forward to our dental visits to Dr. Aman rest assured we are in safe hands. The clinic is also well maintained with all modern amenities. I would highly recommend Dr. Aman to anyone who is due for a dental consultation !",

She is very professional & usually takes the call 24/7 for any queries. \r\nShe really does a good job in gaining the patients trust, & needless to say she does  an excellent job on the teeth & she explains very neatly on the problems in the teeth & what can be done, later on how to take care of the teeth & follow up sessions.\r\n\r\nShe explains the tablets to take and does not give high dosage of tablets unnecessarily. \r\n\r\nThe charges are nominal or standard charges like any other dentist.\r\n\r\nI trust Dr. Aman Sodhi & i strongly recommend her.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNisha",

I was lucky to have Practo suggest me Dr Aman who was more than a savior to me. I was so much in pain and dreaded the injection so much, she showed all her patience and treated my tooth. I went for a second seating without any fear and for the injection done . she makes you feel so comfortable, just like one of her kids and you won't even realise when it's done. can't thank her enough for easing my pain.

She was fluent in making me understand the severity of the infection, treatment procedures and dental technicalities  in layman terms.\nAfter RCT was complete, I had zero pain and didn't take any pain killers.\n\nI opted for Silicon cap after RCT was complete,she took personal attention in picking the right size and color for the crown to suit the rest of the teeth. It took just 3 days to get the crown from the lab. Now the best part, I was so flattered with the level of precision with which the crown was fit to match the other teeth. I still cant believe how original my tooth looks now.\n\nThanks doctor, very happy with the treatment :)",

She was quick in her work and she made sure that I didn't have any kind of discomfort. I had to get Root Canal done on my tooth. Not only that it was painless, but I was really happy with the way she dealt with me, as I was really really scared before visiting her.

She handled very well with a glittering smile on her face without making me to worry about anything. She treated very well with my problem. At first, it was planned to go for root canal, but subsequently due to my abscess condition, it was planned for pulling out. After pulling the tooth out, now I am pain-free, which I was suffering from almost a month. Also Dr Ashwini was good in handling with my case. I am thankful to both Dr Aman Sodhi and Dr Ashwini. Also I should thank another doctor whose name I do not remember who pulled my tooth in less than 10 seconds. Clinic is very good in look and hygienic.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to all who has dental problem to visit Dr Aman's clinic once to lead your rest of life with a smile from your teeth.....\r\n\r\nThank you Dr Aman and Dr Ashwini.",

She took a detailed medical history - which was surprising in a good way. She got a full picture and explained to me what was causing my limited mouth opening and what were the problems with the root canal treated tooth and other problems too. The procedure was complex because of the various problems I had and she was kind, generous and patient with her time and expertise. She\u2019s very professional and takes the time to explain things and also offer options regarding treatment in a way that a lay person can understand without dumbing things down or complicating them. \n\nIt took around 6 sittings to get my root canal done and each sitting about an hour because of my limited mouth opening. She was patient, and she put me at ease while making sure that I was comfortable during the procedure. This is the most enjoyable dental procedure I\u2019ve done despite it being very complex. Her fees are so very reasonable and I was very pleased that every charge was explained to me and at every point there was full transparency. \n\nI see her and her team work with so much professionalism, passion and genuine care for their patients. That is so very rare in these days and Dr. Aman is officially one of my favourite doctors now. \n\nI recommend her whole heartedly for her expertise, knowledge, care and attitude as a human being and a doctor.",

I visited many Doctors and they used to tell solutions or answers which were not satisfying or giving justice to money. Dr. Aman Sodha explains all possible alternatives with cost effective solution and doesn't give any false promise. I am writing this story after 2 months of filling my teeth and having no issues at all so far. I recommend Dr. Aman 100% to all for dental issues. Thank you Dr. Aman and Practo :)",

The cleaning was done well, except that the bib was put in place after all of my saliva was in my hair. This needs to be step one. Nonetheless, the cleaning was well done. I just kept feeling that the swelling wasn't given as much attention as should have been because it lasted a while after the cleaning. It's still here but getting better tad bit slowly. ",

I am highly thankful to my friend who recommended me to visit her. She is very caring and concerned about providing the best possible treatment to all her patients. I could easily see this while I was waiting for my treatment turn. Equally important is the point that the treatment cost is much lower than other dentists that I have visited in the past for a similar treatment. Many thanks doctor for your great treatment. I will recommend Dr Aman to my family members and well wishers.",

Finally got sensible advice from dr Aman. folks please avoid visiting branded hosp for dental advice at least, coz they will have some junior doctors as they cant afford experience (simple corp math). these big branded corporate hospitals can easily force these junior docs by making them nervous about their job security and by other corp arm twisting stuffs to manipulate and keep their infrastructure investment, doc/staff charges in mind before advising a visitor. You should definitely spend Rs. 300 to check the worthiness of my words before you believe me, visit Dr Aman to check out for any dental problems then take the final call.
