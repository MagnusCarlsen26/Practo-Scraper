Doctor suggested to go for extraction.\n\nFirstly when i spoke to Dr. Kavitha and she could sense that I am too scared for any extraction, she comforted me saying that I can just come, get the tooth checked and if i dont wish to continue i can leave it. But not to worry. That itself was too comforting. I decided to go there.\n\nAfter going there, didn\u2019t have to wait at all.\n\nDr. Srihari and Dr. Kavitha were have given time quickly. I explained to them that I am too scared of pricks or anything and i tend to faint.\n\nDr. Srihari has also again comforted me during the whole procedure. I was feeling uncomfortable after first injection and to that he was way too much patient with me.\n\nWhen he removed the tooth, it took him literally 2-5 min but i think the team spent more than 15 min to make me calm in that place.\n\nI may not have gone ahead if they were not this patient.\n\nI know they have given their valuable time to me and gone extra mile to make me feel comfortable.\n\nDr. Kavitha has also personally been checking on me after the procedure on the conditions.\n\nI would certainly recommend the duo.\n\nThanks a lot doctor.\n\nYou both are charming",

Doctor suggested to go for extraction.\n\nFirstly when i spoke to Dr. Kavitha and she could sense that I am too scared for any extraction, she comforted me saying that I can just come, get the tooth checked and if i dont wish to continue i can leave it. But not to worry. That itself was too comforting. I decided to go there.\n\nAfter going there, didn\u2019t have to wait at all.\n\nDr. Srihari and Dr. Kavitha were have given time quickly. I explained to them that I am too scared of pricks or anything and i tend to faint.\n\nDr. Srihari has also again comforted me during the whole procedure. I was feeling uncomfortable after first injection and to that he was way too much patient with me.\n\nWhen he removed the tooth, it took him literally 2-5 min but i think the team spent more than 15 min to make me calm in that place.\n\nI may not have gone ahead if they were not this patient.\n\nI know they have given their valuable time to me and gone extra mile to make me feel comfortable.\n\nDr. Kavitha has also personally been checking on me after the procedure on the conditions.\n\nI would certainly recommend the duo.\n\nThanks a lot doctor.\n\nYou both are charming",

He make me feel comfortable & assured me i will not get pain. After that only he started the procedure. At each step of procedure he told me what can happen so that i can reach appropriately. Like in case if get pain during procedure, how to signal for same. Its been 6 days and i didn\u2019t got pain even once and that part is healing fast. \nOverall i am very happy with Dr Srihari.

I don't see any side effects. Neither any swelling nor extreme pain. But that could be very subjective and dependent on body composition and medical history.\r\nOne suggestion to the doc though (assuming he is reading this review):\r\nThough tooth extraction may sound minor and very routine to the doctor, ultimately it's a surgical procedure which may involve loss of some amount of blood. It's advisable that the doctor notes down the blood group and any such relevant info before starting the procedure. This was not done in my case and I realized it after I started spitting blood while gargling during the procedure :) ",

I have had wisdom tooth extraction done before and it was a very painful experience. Doctor Srihari calmly explained the procedure and was extremely patient. He kept reassuring me throughout the procedure. My teeth were curved at the bottom so couldn\u2019t be pulled out easily, a part had to be cut and then the entire tooth had to be twisted and pulled out. He made sure that I was only able to feel the pressure and absolutely no pain. He is a very skilled professional and is able to show great empathy for his patients. Very impressed and grateful, will definitely recommend to all my friends. ",

The experience was really bad and what the doctor explained me pre-surgery didn't match with during the surgery and post-surgery. So I decided to go to another doctor for my 2nd wisdom tooth extraction.\n\nTo my luck I found a good doctor, Dr. Srihari. This surgery was complex as the tooth was shooting outwards towards cheak at bad angle. It took doctor around 20-25 mins for the main surgery itself, and a overall time of around 45 mins. Surgery went smooth without much problems. Doctors explanation was really good. In fact I had a very minimal swelling on next day of surgery too. I have come to know that Dr. Srihari mainly deals in the extraction cases. I had a good experience with him.\nI am happy and satisfied with the treatment provided.",
