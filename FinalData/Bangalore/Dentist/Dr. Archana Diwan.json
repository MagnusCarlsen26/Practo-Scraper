I had taken oral health for granted till I turned 30, Dr Archana made me realize how important out oral health is for our general health. I felt very comfortable doing my teeth cleaning n root canal treatment, I put a zirconia cap as well, all the treatment went fine. I recommend family dental to all, the staff n doctors are very nice n soft spoken, clinic is neat n clean. \nThanks",

Mine wisdom tooth extraction had complexity where the space to grow the tooth was less, hence it was very near to my jaw bone plus my gym was covering it more than half. There was infection in this gum and lot of swelling. The two dentists whom I had formerly visited didn't give me proper medication and one quoted a bigger sum which after sometime came down to some percentages. But I was surprised to see the behaviour of doctors as for them patients have become puppets. \nWhen I came here I was scared but since one of friends gave high recommendation to these doctors I came to them. But the way Dr Abhinav, Dr. Archana and their team helped me came out to be a pleasant surprise. They changed my medication due to which my swelling came down within a day and after that very precisely extracted my tooth. Amazing experience I had with them.. would I highly recommend them over here :)",

Mine wisdom tooth extraction had complexity where the space to grow the tooth was less, hence it was very near to my jaw bone plus my gym was covering it more than half. There was infection in this gum and lot of swelling. The two dentists whom I had formerly visited didn't give me proper medication and one quoted a bigger sum which after sometime came down to some percentages. But I was surprised to see the behaviour of doctors as for them patients have become puppets. \nWhen I came here I was scared but since one of friends gave high recommendation to these doctors I came to them. But the way Dr Abhinav, Dr. Archana and their team helped me came out to be a pleasant surprise. They changed my medication due to which my swelling came down within a day and after that very precisely extracted my tooth. Amazing experience I had with them.. would I highly recommend them over here :)",

When my child started crying (not because of pain but scared because of suction noise) she diverted his mind asking about his favourite ice creams and had him relaxed and laugh.\nIt was a kids friendly atmosphere - my son really liked the Spiderman apron used for the procedure as well.
