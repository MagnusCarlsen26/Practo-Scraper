Second is her holistic approach. Dr Smitha clearly understands that the oral area, body and mind are intimately connected. Life style stresses have more impact than we know. I got great insight into life style stresses which have likely contributed to my dental problems.

Third is her commitment to the least invasive, simplest, cost effective solution possible. This truly amazes me in a time where many people are strongly influenced by monetary motivations.
