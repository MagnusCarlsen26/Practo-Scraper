Earlier I had a bad experience where the pain during the root canal treatment was extremely unbearable but with doctor Subhash, it was a very pleasant experience. The whole treatment got completed in two settings and by the 3rd appointment, I could get my cap fixed, and thereafter I did not have any other issues with that tooth. I strongly recommend people in the Sarjapur area to visit Achla clinic and you will get real value for your money as well as professional treatment.\n\n\n",

I had only planned to remove my lowerleft wisdom tooth but Subhash sir & Priya mam advised me to remove both left upper & lower together as it would be the better option. They explained me each process step by step which helped me in getting through.I got muscle stiffness during the procedure & got very much nervous but Dr.Srikanth was very much patient and in the end it went well. Also they followed up to check if I am doing fine which makes Achala stand out from other clinics. It makes you feel you are in safe hands.Glad I went to Achala & nowhere else.",

Earlier I had a bad experience where the pain during the root canal treatment was extremely unbearable but with doctor Subhash, it was a very pleasant experience. The whole treatment got completed in two settings and by the 3rd appointment, I could get my cap fixed, and thereafter I did not have any other issues with that tooth. I strongly recommend people in the Sarjapur area to visit Achla clinic and you will get real value for your money as well as professional treatment.\n\n\n",

I had only planned to remove my lowerleft wisdom tooth but Subhash sir & Priya mam advised me to remove both left upper & lower together as it would be the better option. They explained me each process step by step which helped me in getting through.I got muscle stiffness during the procedure & got very much nervous but Dr.Srikanth was very much patient and in the end it went well. Also they followed up to check if I am doing fine which makes Achala stand out from other clinics. It makes you feel you are in safe hands.Glad I went to Achala & nowhere else.",
