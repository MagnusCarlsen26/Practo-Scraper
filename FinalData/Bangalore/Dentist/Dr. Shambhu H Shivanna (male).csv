"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Veneers / Laminates,",0,0,YES,"I was in search of a Prosthodontist since last 6 months for getting veneers done on the front tooth.  Since it was a kind of smile correction, I was not ready to settle for a doctor until I found it convincing myself which was of utmost importance. Though I visited multiple dental clinics none of them were satisfactory. I was referred to Dr. Shambhu by a friend. He is commendable at his work moreover he had a convincing approach about the procedure. He understood my requirement and suggested the treatment. The whole procedure went smoothly without any fear, pain or discomfort. I am glad I made the right choice of the doctor and would highly recommend. Thank You Sir!
