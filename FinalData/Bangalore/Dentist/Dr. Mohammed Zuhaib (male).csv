,,0,0,YES,"I was referred to Dr. Zohaib by my dentist for a complex wisdom tooth extraction. The wisdom tooth was inverted with it's crown pushing towards the molar and also formed a cyst with fair amount of bone loss. It had to be surgically extracted under General Anesthesia.

Dr. Zohaib took care of it and the surgery went very well. ** ** **** ******** *** *************. Most of all he is very approachable and answers all my questions patiently and elaborately in whatsapp.

I highly recommend Dr. Zohaib for any dental treatments and consultations.

Thank you Dr. Zohaib.",2021-01-29 05:34:08,False,True,deepika kiran,,,
