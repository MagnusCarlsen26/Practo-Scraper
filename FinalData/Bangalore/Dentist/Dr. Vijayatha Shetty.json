So, it took three visits to complete the whole process.\nOn 1st day, the RCT process started, as my tooth had more infection, I felt certain amount of pain, but the doctor was very supportive, nice and interacted with me the entire time.\n2nd day it was tooth shaping. As RCT was done, I did not feel any pain during shaping. And then doctor took measurement of my tooth for preparing the cap.\n3rd day was cap implantation. It took very less time and after the cap was fitted, I felt that the measurement was perfect and I did not feel any problem to bite. The cap looked like real tooth only.\n\nSo, overall it was a nice experience and I would like to recommend Dr. Vijetha Shetty for RCT.",

As RCT was done, I did not feel any pain during shaping. And then doctor took measurement of my tooth for preparing the cap.\n3rd day was cap implantation. It took very less time and after the cap was fitted, I felt that the measurement was perfect and I did not feel any problem to bite. The cap looked like real tooth only.\n\nSo, overall it was a nice experience and I would like to recommend Dr. Vijetha Shetty for RCT.",
