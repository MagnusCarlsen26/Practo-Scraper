,,0,0,YES,"My brother in law had an emergency surgery for his right leg fracture due to accident. Dr Vijay Kulkarni did the surgery. Though he is little busy, he has been very friendly and clarified all our doubts. My brother in law is recovering fast and very happy with the treatment.

My wife had a planned surgery for removal of a loose mass (calcification) in left foot and frozen left shoulder. Dr Vijay discussed the problem thoroughly and suggested surgery for removal of growth in foot. Surgery went off well at Astra Super Specialty Hospital. Though Dr Vijay seems to be little busy, he discusses problem well and finds a solution. 

Astra hospital staff (cleaners, nurses, admin staff, and the canteen boy) took good care. Cleanliness was very good.
