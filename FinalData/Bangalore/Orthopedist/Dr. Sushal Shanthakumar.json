I've been very physically active all my life and I was apprehensive about the surgery as I was also exploring conservative ways of exercising and the long recovery was looking daunting. The surgery went smoothly, the recovery was very fast for me. After 3-4 months itself I was allowed to slowly start exercising along with the physio. I wanted an athlete centric approach to my treatment, so that I can go back to my life of working out at the gym, go boxing and swimming; and I got that here. Here I am, 6 months after the surgery,  on my way to get stronger than before.",

This was corroborated by the MRI Scan report as well. \n\nDr. Sushal after careful examination of all reports and physical examination of my son suggested us to go for bankart surgery for repair of the shoulder. He drew the parts of the shoulder and explained in detail the root cause of the issue causing discomfort to my Son\u2019s right shoulder. He as well showed a video which had complete details that helped us understand, the root cause of the discomfort and the treatment process for repair of the injury, in a more practical way. These treatment qualities and skills are the true traits of a real experienced expert doctor.\n\nThe surgery was done in Manipal Hospital by Dr. Sushal and his team.\nWe were in the hospital for two nights and were discharged on the third day.\nIn the post-surgery consulting visits, he checked upon the recovery progress and taught some exercises as well.\nMy Son is currently in physiotherapy sessions and is on the road towards complete recovery.\n\nA big thanks to Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar for supporting us through out with all his expert skills and a very good attitude. He was always there whenever we needed his support.\nHe is a wonderful orthopedic who is always helpful, compassionate & lovely to speak with, at every appointment.\n\nWe are extremely happy to have come to know about Dr. Sushal who in my personal opinion is arguably the best shoulder orthopedic expert doctor in Bengaluru.\n \nI would definitely recommend Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar to anyone requiring a shoulder or any orthopedic injury treatment.",

Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar is very experienced and professional Doctor. \nBeing a sportsperson, I found it very difficult to play sports. I had given up playing both my favourite sports cricket and Badminton for 1 year due to pain. Also, I was unable to sleep on my right side. I had done X ray and MRI scan prescribed by my previous doctor. As per the MRI report, I had adhesive capsulitis in my right shoulder. Through a Doctor known to me, I came in contact with Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar. He listened to my problems very patiently and examined my shoulder thoroughly. The way he guided me was really appreciable. He advised physical therapy exercises which involved stretching, mobility and strength training. The physical therapy sessions were excellent. I strictly followed the guidelines prescribed by the Doctor. Gradually pain in my shoulder reduced and after strengthening, I was able to start playing sports. Within a span of six months, I recovered completely. His clinic is very well maintained, very spacious with good hygiene. I would strongly recommend Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar for any shoulder, sports and orthopaedic injuries.\n",

The injury was so severe that the shoulder dislocated repeatedly while doing day to day activities like wearing a shirt, strapping my backback etc. This is when I met Dr. Sushal and told him about my condition. With the MRI reports clearly stating the labrum tear and with a few shoulder mobility tests, Dr. Sushal advised me to undergo a surgery. Dr. Sushal helped me understand the entire procedure which somewhat helped me relax and take confident decision to proceed with the surgery. He also helped me chalk out a plan on how the recovery should happen post surgery. The day of the surgery I was much more relaxed and with the highly trained and expert team the entire procedure was done in about an hour. In less than 48 hours, I was discharged as well. With my monthly scheduled appointments, there was tremendous progress just after 2.5 weeks. Fast forwarding to 120th day and I was already driving car, doing push ups and yes returning to football.I would like to thank Dr. Sushal for helping me get around this so quickly and feeling much more confident about my shoulder.Thank you doc, *** *** *** ***** ",

Primary injury was from badminton, some 10 years ago and i was not convinced with any doctor at that time and choose to be careful and not go for a surgery. \n\nA recent dislocation got me to explore more and met up with Dr. Sushal at Manipal Hospital. He explained the problem well and since i had 120 degree ligament tear i had to take up an 'arthroscopic bankart repair with bio Sutures' surgery. Till date, i had not been given this clear picture on the problem by any other doctor.\n\nThe surgery went very well, * ********* ******** Now after 12 weeks, i feel quite confident to move my left arm more freely, without fear of dislocation. The 100% recovery could take 4-6 months along with physio excersice, but i'm 90% there and feel happy about my decision to undergo surgery with Dr. Sushal.\n\nThanks.",

The surgery went smoothly, the recovery was very fast for me. After 3-4 months itself I was allowed to slowly start exercising along with the physio. I wanted an athlete centric approach to my treatment, so that I can go back to my life of working out at the gym, go boxing and swimming; and I got that here.

This was corroborated by the MRI Scan report as well. \n\nDr. Sushal after careful examination of all reports and physical examination of my son suggested us to go for bankart surgery for repair of the shoulder. He drew the parts of the shoulder and explained in detail the root cause of the issue causing discomfort to my Son\u2019s right shoulder. He as well showed a video which had complete details that helped us understand, the root cause of the discomfort and the treatment process for repair of the injury, in a more practical way. These treatment qualities and skills are the true traits of a real experienced expert doctor.\n\nThe surgery was done in Manipal Hospital by Dr. Sushal and his team.\nWe were in the hospital for two nights and were discharged on the third day.\nIn the post-surgery consulting visits, he checked upon the recovery progress and taught some exercises as well.\nMy Son is currently in physiotherapy sessions and is on the road towards complete recovery.\n\nA big thanks to Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar for supporting us through out with all his expert skills and a very good attitude. He was always there whenever we needed his support.\nHe is a wonderful orthopedic who is always helpful, compassionate & lovely to speak with, at every appointment.\n\nWe are extremely happy to have come to know about Dr. Sushal who in my personal opinion is arguably the best shoulder orthopedic expert doctor in Bengaluru.\n \nI would definitely recommend Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar to anyone requiring a shoulder or any orthopedic injury treatment.",

Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar is very experienced and professional Doctor. \nBeing a sportsperson, I found it very difficult to play sports. I had given up playing both my favourite sports cricket and Badminton for 1 year due to pain. Also, I was unable to sleep on my right side. I had done X ray and MRI scan prescribed by my previous doctor. As per the MRI report, I had adhesive capsulitis in my right shoulder. Through a Doctor known to me, I came in contact with Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar. He listened to my problems very patiently and examined my shoulder thoroughly. The way he guided me was really appreciable. He advised physical therapy exercises which involved stretching, mobility and strength training. The physical therapy sessions were excellent. I strictly followed the guidelines prescribed by the Doctor. Gradually pain in my shoulder reduced and after strengthening, I was able to start playing sports. Within a span of six months, I recovered completely. His clinic is very well maintained, very spacious with good hygiene. I would strongly recommend Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar for any shoulder, sports and orthopaedic injuries.\n",

He patiently explained all the questions in detail and helped my family and me understand both the surgical procedure and the underlying condition anatomically through drawings and videos. Just after the first visit, all my apprehensions were gone and I was mentally prepared for the surgery and I believe that is very important for any procedure.\n\nPost-surgery, he gave me confidence at each stage of the recovery and that helped just as much as the exercises :D \n\nOverall, I felt that he is a wonderful person and I really appreciate the support he has provided till now.

The injury was so severe that the shoulder dislocated repeatedly while doing day to day activities like wearing a shirt, strapping my backback etc. This is when I met Dr. Sushal and told him about my condition. With the MRI reports clearly stating the labrum tear and with a few shoulder mobility tests, Dr. Sushal advised me to undergo a surgery. Dr. Sushal helped me understand the entire procedure which somewhat helped me relax and take confident decision to proceed with the surgery. He also helped me chalk out a plan on how the recovery should happen post surgery. The day of the surgery I was much more relaxed and with the highly trained and expert team the entire procedure was done in about an hour. In less than 48 hours, I was discharged as well. With my monthly scheduled appointments, there was tremendous progress just after 2.5 weeks. Fast forwarding to 120th day and I was already driving car, doing push ups and yes returning to football.I would like to thank Dr. Sushal for helping me get around this so quickly and feeling much more confident about my shoulder.Thank you doc, *** *** *** ***** ",

Primary injury was from badminton, some 10 years ago and i was not convinced with any doctor at that time and choose to be careful and not go for a surgery. \n\nA recent dislocation got me to explore more and met up with Dr. Sushal at Manipal Hospital. He explained the problem well and since i had 120 degree ligament tear i had to take up an 'arthroscopic bankart repair with bio Sutures' surgery. Till date, i had not been given this clear picture on the problem by any other doctor.\n\nThe surgery went very well, * ********* ******** Now after 12 weeks, i feel quite confident to move my left arm more freely, without fear of dislocation. The 100% recovery could take 4-6 months along with physio excersice, but i'm 90% there and feel happy about my decision to undergo surgery with Dr. Sushal.\n\nThanks.",

I had dislocated my shoulder twice and was concerned if this would turn into recurring dislocation. I had consulted multiple orthopedic doctors, but didn't get a clear picture of neither the problem nor the solution.\nDr. Sushal is a very honest and straight forward man and having specialized in shoulder, he could give me a very clear picture of where I stand and what my options are. That I think is as important as the surgery itself with so much information one perceives now a days. Coming to the surgery, I was just admitted for < 2 days and it was as smooth as it can get. It has been two months since my surgery and I can't be happier with the result. For any shoulder related / orthopedic problems, I would recommend him as the go-to doctor for all of you.",

He always displayed thorough knowledge in the subject matter and put it across in a very easily understandable manner, which gave us all a sense of comfort. \nOverall, a really good doctor and an even better person, would strongly recommend him to anyone looking for a good orthopedic surgeon.",

To fix the shoulder, Dr. Sushal recommended a surgery. I am extremely pleased with the outcome and have made an exceptional recovery, regaining most of the mobility within 10 weeks. He was very thorough in his examination and very patient in explaining the issue and the proposed treatment plan. He is extremely friendly and approachable. These 2 points stand out when compared to most other surgeons. He has the ability of inspiring confidence in the treatment plan, which is extremely crucial especially since the path ahead of an injury always seems uncertain. His competence is evident, seeing as I am recovering from a chronic shoulder issue that I thought would never get better. I highly recommend Dr. Sushal for your orthopedic needs, especially for shoulder issues. ",

I was consulting a very well known consultant at Manipal Hospital Old Airport Road. As a result I was put on a plaster 1.5 month after the accident happened in Feb. Even after my plaster came off recovery was very slow. Still I did not know what the exact cause was. Doctor I was consulting did not seem to have an opinion or the interest to provide a prognosis.  It was then that I consulted Dr.Sushal at his Praxis clinic. I had all the while known about him but was a bit hesitant as his profile is of a shoulder specialist *** ** ** ********** *** ** *** **** ** ********* *** ********* However then I came to know that shoulder is one of the most complex assemblies and decided to consult him. It paid off and finally I had a proper explanation of my condition and firm guidance on recovery. Dr. Sushal looked at my past reports and concluded that there was a fracture to my fibula which was not picked up all this while. He took me through the X Ray reports  and patiently with help of diagram explained where exactly the break was. He got another X ray done which showed that the break was healing and advised course of healing. Thanks to Dr. Sushant that I now seem to have a closure on my problem. Only wish I had consulted him Day 1.",

I took 20 sessions of physiotherapy (Rejoice Physiotherapy in Kasturi Nagar, Bangalore), where I can feel the difference and leg became straight and flexible enough to walk properly. The good news is after the second consultation, Dr. Sushal said not to undergo ACL surgery as I don't have any symptoms for the surgery. His skill and expertise as an orthopedic doctor were evident.\n\nI highly recommend Dr.Sushal to anyone in need of orthopedic care. \nThank you for your great work! Dr.Sushal :-)",

He did a very detailed test of all my movements and pain points of my shoulder, only after this did he even look at the MRI scan that I had gotten.\nHe then explained to me very well what my issue was. He used great pictures/animations and videos from his computer to clearly help me visualize the issue. He was very friendly and open. He answered all of my questions (around 20 questions) that I had prepared in my second consultation, very clearly and patiently.\nHe was the only ortho that I had visited (4 others) that diagnosed my hyper-mobility and explained it's consequences. Even though he is a shoulder specialist surgeon, he recommended that I do not do surgery because that would be a better route for me.\n\nExtremely good doctor. Would recommend fully to anybody with shoulder issues.",
