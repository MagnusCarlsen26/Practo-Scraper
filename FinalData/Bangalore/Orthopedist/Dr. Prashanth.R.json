I didn't get any chance to meet people who boost my confidence and refer to good orthopedic surgeon for total knee replacement.\nTo ease out my mom's pain I browsed the Google intensively and preferred to have an opinion with Dr.Prashanth. Mr.Franklin Anthony who is very generous, helpful, supportive and soft spoken fixed an appointment with Doctor.\nDoctor educated us about Robotic surgery and boosted our confidence, with good faith and Grace of God I fixed the date of Total Knee Replacement surgery on that moment only.\nDr. Prashanth by virtue \"Vydyo Narayana Harihi\". Doctor is dignified, confident, calm, graceful, helpful, courteous, polite, understanding, gentle, very encouraging, boosts one's confidence, highly professional, highly skilled, 100 percent success in surgery, clears all the doubt pertains to orthopedic ailment and over all easily approachable.\nAll the treatment I took was on higher side still it is very reasonable compared to other hospital. In hospital good care taken, hygienic, and give awesome facility. Being a person like me who doesn't have any medical back ground and without any influence Doctor treated us very well who is the person of ethics to serve the people and relieved from hospital by easing out pain with total knee replacement surgery with 100 percent success.\nI highly recommend the services of Dr,Prashanth to any patient orthopedic  \nrelated issues.\nThank you so much Dr,Prashanth sir, for serving us.

I was suffering from this pain for a month long but Dr. Prashant's magical treatment like I say, cured me of this back pain in 2weeeks with minimal medication. He knows how to treat his patients well. He is very courteous,polite and highly professional when he is interacting with patients. I recommend Dr. Prashant R for any kind of Orthopaedic issues you have, trust me he will bring you back to life. Thank you so much Dr.Prashanth you are my saviour. ",

Mr.Franklin Anthony who is very generous, helpful, supportive and soft spoken fixed an appointment with Doctor.\nDoctor educated us about Robotic surgery and boosted our confidence, with good faith and Grace of God I fixed the date of Total Knee Replacement surgery on that moment only.\nDr. Prashanth by virtue \"Vydyo Narayana Harihi\". Doctor is dignified, confident, calm, graceful, helpful, courteous, polite, understanding, gentle, very encouraging, boosts one's confidence, highly professional, highly skilled, 100 percent success in surgery, clears all the doubt pertains to orthopedic ailment and over all easily approachable.\nAll the treatment I took was on higher side still it is very reasonable compared to other hospital. In hospital good care taken, hygienic, and give awesome facility.

I was suffering from this pain for a month long but Dr. Prashant's magical treatment like I say, cured me of this back pain in 2weeeks with minimal medication. He knows how to treat his patients well. He is very courteous,polite and highly professional when he is interacting with patients. I recommend Dr. Prashant R for any kind of Orthopaedic issues you have, trust me he will bring you back to life. Thank you so much Dr.Prashanth you are my saviour. ",

The surgery was done and every detail of it was explained to us as to what was the condition of the leg and what has been done.\nHe doesn't give unnecessary medicines and emphasises on exercises, food habits and natural healing processes. In 2 months, father started walking using walker and in next 2 months he started to walk even without it. It was purely based on the confidence given by the doctor to my dad. Now he visits the doctor for follow ups from another state  (since he is based in another state; that's the quality and friendliness).
