"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Shoulder Arthoscopy,",0,0,YES,"I got referred to Dr. Sushal after consecutive shoulder dislocations. He sat me down and explained what is wrong and why I need surgery, and how it will benefit me. I've been very physically active all my life and I was apprehensive about the surgery as I was also exploring conservative ways of exercising and the long recovery was looking daunting. The surgery went smoothly, the recovery was very fast for me. After 3-4 months itself I was allowed to slowly start exercising along with the physio. I wanted an athlete centric approach to my treatment, so that I can go back to my life of working out at the gym, go boxing and swimming; and I got that here. Here I am, 6 months after the surgery,  on my way to get stronger than before.",2024-04-08 04:41:40,False,True,Shreehari Thakral,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Arthroscopy,",0,0,YES,"I am writing this review after 12 weeks of my son’s right shoulder surgery [arthroscopic bankart repair].

I came to know about Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar through our long trusted and renowned pediatrician doctor.

Based on this advice, I consulted Dr. Sushal to understand the treatment process for the injury sustained by my son. 
He patiently heard the case, physically examined my son and forthwith identified the problem causing discomfort to my Son. This was corroborated by the MRI Scan report as well. 

Dr. Sushal after careful examination of all reports and physical examination of my son suggested us to go for bankart surgery for repair of the shoulder. He drew the parts of the shoulder and explained in detail the root cause of the issue causing discomfort to my Son’s right shoulder. He as well showed a video which had complete details that helped us understand, the root cause of the discomfort and the treatment process for repair of the injury, in a more practical way. These treatment qualities and skills are the true traits of a real experienced expert doctor.

The surgery was done in Manipal Hospital by Dr. Sushal and his team.
We were in the hospital for two nights and were discharged on the third day.
In the post-surgery consulting visits, he checked upon the recovery progress and taught some exercises as well.
My Son is currently in physiotherapy sessions and is on the road towards complete recovery.

A big thanks to Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar for supporting us through out with all his expert skills and a very good attitude. He was always there whenever we needed his support.
He is a wonderful orthopedic who is always helpful, compassionate & lovely to speak with, at every appointment.

We are extremely happy to have come to know about Dr. Sushal who in my personal opinion is arguably the best shoulder orthopedic expert doctor in Bengaluru.
 
I would definitely recommend Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar to anyone requiring a shoulder or any orthopedic injury treatment.",2023-06-27 05:36:29,False,True,Srinivas,,,

I visited Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar for pain in my right shoulder which I has having from the past 4 years. Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar is very experienced and professional Doctor. 
Being a sportsperson, I found it very difficult to play sports. I had given up playing both my favourite sports cricket and Badminton for 1 year due to pain. Also, I was unable to sleep on my right side. I had done X ray and MRI scan prescribed by my previous doctor. As per the MRI report, I had adhesive capsulitis in my right shoulder. Through a Doctor known to me, I came in contact with Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar. He listened to my problems very patiently and examined my shoulder thoroughly. The way he guided me was really appreciable. He advised physical therapy exercises which involved stretching, mobility and strength training. The physical therapy sessions were excellent. I strictly followed the guidelines prescribed by the Doctor. Gradually pain in my shoulder reduced and after strengthening, I was able to start playing sports. Within a span of six months, I recovered completely. His clinic is very well maintained, very spacious with good hygiene. I would strongly recommend Dr.Sushal Shanthakumar for any shoulder, sports and orthopaedic injuries.

However, Dr. Sushal was very knowledgeable and took time to explain my condition and treatment options, then suggested me to go for physiotherapy as my knee weren't straight as my other knee. I took 20 sessions of physiotherapy (Rejoice Physiotherapy in Kasturi Nagar, Bangalore), where I can feel the difference and leg became straight and flexible enough to walk properly. The good news is after the second consultation, Dr. Sushal said not to undergo ACL surgery as I don't have any symptoms for the surgery. His skill and expertise as an orthopedic doctor were evident.
