I came to know about Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar through our long trusted and renowned pediatrician doctor.

Based on this advice, I consulted Dr. Sushal to understand the treatment process for the injury sustained by my son. 
He patiently heard the case, physically examined my son and forthwith identified the problem causing discomfort to my Son. This was corroborated by the MRI Scan report as well. 

Dr. Sushal after careful examination of all reports and physical examination of my son suggested us to go for bankart surgery for repair of the shoulder. He drew the parts of the shoulder and explained in detail the root cause of the issue causing discomfort to my Son’s right shoulder. He as well showed a video which had complete details that helped us understand, the root cause of the discomfort and the treatment process for repair of the injury, in a more practical way. These treatment qualities and skills are the true traits of a real experienced expert doctor.

The surgery was done in Manipal Hospital by Dr. Sushal and his team.
We were in the hospital for two nights and were discharged on the third day.
In the post-surgery consulting visits, he checked upon the recovery progress and taught some exercises as well.
My Son is currently in physiotherapy sessions and is on the road towards complete recovery.

A big thanks to Dr. Sushal Shanta Kumar for supporting us through out with all his expert skills and a very good attitude. He was always there whenever we needed his support.
