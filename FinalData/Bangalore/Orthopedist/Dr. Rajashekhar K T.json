                "review_text": "I had been suffering pain in both my knees for nearly a decade. Let alone walk, even standing for a few seconds was excruciatingly difficult. The fear of pain and the lack of clarity on the recovery after surgery made me postpone taking any action for relief till now. Also, I did not know how to decide on the surgeon whom I could trust and be rest assured that I would be able to walk again without pain.\n\nAfter a lot of research and asking around, I met Dr. Rajasekhar K T at Fortis, BG Road. That single meeting was enough for me to be convinced that I am in good hands. X-rays and other diagnosis had revealed that though both my knees required surgery, the damage in the left one was quite intense. \n\nI went ahead with the the joint replacement surgery of both my knees with a gap of 4 days between the two. Apparently, the surgery in the left knee was a very difficult one, as was described by several doctors present during the surgery. However, on both the days of the surgeries, I could walk a few steps on the day itself. I was in the hospital for a total of 9 days. Although there was post-operative pain and discomfort, I was very well taken care of. \n\nIt has been over a month now. My stitches came off after 15 days of the surgeries. I am continuing with physiotherapy and diet control and I am experiencing a noticeable difference in my mobility. Even after I was back home, any time I had a query or a concern, Dr Rajashekhar was always there, just a whatsapp message away.This was a huge support as any new development would make me worried. He would reassure me and prescribe medicines if any was required.   \n\nIf you are suffering because of damaged knees, I highly recommend that you must consult an orthopedic surgeon immediately and if you are in Bangalore, based on my experience I can say quite definitively that you need not look anywhere beyond Dr. Rajashekhar K T.    \n\nVisalakshi Nair\nW/o.

Though we have taken consultation from an Orthopedic surgeon 12 years back and knee replacement operation has been proposed because of Osteoarthritis. My father was not ready for a knee replacement operation till Feb\u201922. His conception was that he may not walk properly after his operation because of his old age. He was using painkillers medicine very frequently without informing us. On Feb '22, his pain was intolerable and the painkiller medicine was not working as per expectation. That\u2019s why we decided on the operation.\nWe are extremely fortunate that we are able to manage an appointment with Dr. Rajashekhar K T who is a specialist in Knee Replacement Surgery at Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore Fortis Hospital. The doctor operated on my father\u2019s both legs with a single hospitalization duration of 8 days, though my father is having complications like Blood Sugar, High Blood Pressure, Kidney & Prostate Issue. I am literally happy to see my father that within 45 days after the operation, my father is walking 2 KM/DAY without any support. He did not feel any pain. The medicine stooped almost 15 days back. I can say we got the best treatment in Bangalore from a world-class doctor with a class -1 hospital within my budget with a limited timeline.\nWe are thankful to the doctor Rajashekhar K T that he has given a new life to my father in his 69 years of age where my father can walk properly without any support without any pain. \n\n",

I have been suffering from joint pain for the past 5 years as during this time I have spoken to many doctors about the joint replacement surgery. But I never got enough confidence to get the surgery done. One of my close friends referred Dr. Rajasekhar to me and mentioned his immense experience in this field.\nDr.Rajasekhar was kind enough to spend extra time patiently answering all my concerns and worries about the surgery and talking to him gave me enough confidence to undergo the surgery and I got both the joints replaced recently. Even during the surgery, he made sure I am comfortable and that I was not feeling any anxiety. After the surgery, his care team was also available at all times to answer any questions. I would definitely recommend Dr.Rajasekhar at Fortis hospital. Thank you Sir!\n\nFrom,\nIndira Bogisetty",

He is an exceptionally good surgeon yet he is so grounded and down to earth. He understands his patient's mind and he makes all possible attempts to ensure that his patient gets the best care possible. I was extremely scared of surgery and was avoiding this surgery since nearly a decade. We had consulted over half a dozen knee specialists before meeting Dr Rajshekar and none of them gave us the confidence, comfort and assurance that we got from Dr Rajshekar. I had bilateral TKR done last week and contrary to what everyone said, the entire process was absolutely smooth and very well managed. Dr Rajshekhar has a great support team which makes the entire process very smooth. Dr Rajshekhar takes genuine interest in ensuring that every surgery is done in the most meticulous manner and he takes great pride in ensuring a text book quality outcome for the patient.\n\nGreat job Sir, you are truly wonderful. You have magic in your hands. May God bless you so that you can alleviate pain from many more patients. Thank you once again Sir.\n\nA sincere advise to those suffering from knee pain : If you are struggling with knee problems, just go and meet Dr Rajshekar once. I assure you that you won\u2019t regret this ever. Dr Rajshekar will definitely change your life.",

                "review_text": "I had been suffering pain in both my knees for nearly a decade. Let alone walk, even standing for a few seconds was excruciatingly difficult. The fear of pain and the lack of clarity on the recovery after surgery made me postpone taking any action for relief till now. Also, I did not know how to decide on the surgeon whom I could trust and be rest assured that I would be able to walk again without pain.\n\nAfter a lot of research and asking around, I met Dr. Rajasekhar K T at Fortis, BG Road. That single meeting was enough for me to be convinced that I am in good hands. X-rays and other diagnosis had revealed that though both my knees required surgery, the damage in the left one was quite intense. \n\nI went ahead with the the joint replacement surgery of both my knees with a gap of 4 days between the two. Apparently, the surgery in the left knee was a very difficult one, as was described by several doctors present during the surgery. However, on both the days of the surgeries, I could walk a few steps on the day itself. I was in the hospital for a total of 9 days. Although there was post-operative pain and discomfort, I was very well taken care of. \n\nIt has been over a month now. My stitches came off after 15 days of the surgeries. I am continuing with physiotherapy and diet control and I am experiencing a noticeable difference in my mobility. Even after I was back home, any time I had a query or a concern, Dr Rajashekhar was always there, just a whatsapp message away.This was a huge support as any new development would make me worried. He would reassure me and prescribe medicines if any was required.   \n\nIf you are suffering because of damaged knees, I highly recommend that you must consult an orthopedic surgeon immediately and if you are in Bangalore, based on my experience I can say quite definitively that you need not look anywhere beyond Dr. Rajashekhar K T.    \n\nVisalakshi Nair\nW/o.

Though we have taken consultation from an Orthopedic surgeon 12 years back and knee replacement operation has been proposed because of Osteoarthritis. My father was not ready for a knee replacement operation till Feb\u201922. His conception was that he may not walk properly after his operation because of his old age. He was using painkillers medicine very frequently without informing us. On Feb '22, his pain was intolerable and the painkiller medicine was not working as per expectation. That\u2019s why we decided on the operation.\nWe are extremely fortunate that we are able to manage an appointment with Dr. Rajashekhar K T who is a specialist in Knee Replacement Surgery at Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore Fortis Hospital. The doctor operated on my father\u2019s both legs with a single hospitalization duration of 8 days, though my father is having complications like Blood Sugar, High Blood Pressure, Kidney & Prostate Issue. I am literally happy to see my father that within 45 days after the operation, my father is walking 2 KM/DAY without any support. He did not feel any pain. The medicine stooped almost 15 days back. I can say we got the best treatment in Bangalore from a world-class doctor with a class -1 hospital within my budget with a limited timeline.\nWe are thankful to the doctor Rajashekhar K T that he has given a new life to my father in his 69 years of age where my father can walk properly without any support without any pain. \n\n",

But I never got enough confidence to get the surgery done. One of my close friends referred Dr. Rajasekhar to me and mentioned his immense experience in this field.\nDr.Rajasekhar was kind enough to spend extra time patiently answering all my concerns and worries about the surgery and talking to him gave me enough confidence to undergo the surgery and I got both the joints replaced recently. Even during the surgery, he made sure I am comfortable and that I was not feeling any anxiety. After the surgery, his care team was also available at all times to answer any questions. I would definitely recommend Dr.Rajasekhar at Fortis hospital. Thank you Sir!\n\nFrom,\nIndira Bogisetty",

He understands his patient's mind and he makes all possible attempts to ensure that his patient gets the best care possible. I was extremely scared of surgery and was avoiding this surgery since nearly a decade. We had consulted over half a dozen knee specialists before meeting Dr Rajshekar and none of them gave us the confidence, comfort and assurance that we got from Dr Rajshekar. I had bilateral TKR done last week and contrary to what everyone said, the entire process was absolutely smooth and very well managed. Dr Rajshekhar has a great support team which makes the entire process very smooth. Dr Rajshekhar takes genuine interest in ensuring that every surgery is done in the most meticulous manner and he takes great pride in ensuring a text book quality outcome for the patient.\n\nGreat job Sir, you are truly wonderful. You have magic in your hands. May God bless you so that you can alleviate pain from many more patients. Thank you once again Sir.\n\nA sincere advise to those suffering from knee pain : If you are struggling with knee problems, just go and meet Dr Rajshekar once.

He takes utmost responsibility and care of patient to explain the complete details and remedies to be taken with minimum expenses, around three months back I have taken my life partner C Usharani aged 50 years in wheelchair who struggled with  heavy and unbearable pain in joint to walk almost from 5 years. we have consulted so many doctors and visited many hospitals for the treatment but finally we have decided after lot of research to  meet Dr Rajasekar KT after thorough checkup he suggested joint replacement for right knee and surgery was done two months back successfully. Now my better-half is very happily walking 5 to 6 kms every day.\n\nWe are very much thankful to Dr Rajasekar KT for giving second life to my wife.\n\n(any suggestions from me feel free to call 9393608760 at any time)\n\n",

After taking second opinion, I came across Rajashekhar and he did not support the operation and gave the confidence it will be healed in conservative method( By using the belt) and no need to go for surgery. He was in touch actively and prescribed the required medicines online. After 6weeks, we could clearly see the collarbone fractured healed and looks normal. I want to highly recommend this Dr to all and thanks for his support during this times and he never took consultation fees as well but I still owe you something. Thank you. ",
