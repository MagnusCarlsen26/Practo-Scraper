"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Chirag Thonse, an absolute magician! True magic in his hands and I can say it by my firsthand experience. My ACL reconstruction was due for almost 3 years and what I did during this time was researched and tried all possible means to have my ligament back to avoid an operation. Now with the numerous videos on YouTube about ACL repair/reconstruction of which few are motivating by a step and few demotivating back by several steps, to sum up on the outcome of the research that I did, I was confused and afraid of a surgery and hence the reason to the delay. Well I must admit that I have consulted many Doctors and have no count of the number of MRI’s that I have taken in an expectation to see if my ligament has improved by time. Dr. Chirag Thonse was one such doctor whom I met and with the discussion on the approach and the confidence he gave me I was convinced, at that point I felt I need to get the reconstruction procedure done right away then and there. It was in March 2020 that I consulted Dr. Chirag and in April 2020 I underwent the surgery, mind you it was the lockdown and yes he operated my ACL with the pandemic around. On the experiences from the blogs and videos that I had I was certain of the post operation pain and was nervous beyond normal. The day of operation, it was no less than thriller with my heart pounding hard and all the prep-up going on for the procedure. Finally I was at the operation theatre witnessing the entire procedure on the TV/monitor while Dr. Chirag and team were in action. After the operation I was under care for almost 2 hours and later shifted to my ward. All that I was awaiting and prepared for was the post-op pain, the night of the operation I experienced it but not to the extent that I had read and watched. I thought probably it is the anesthesia and the pain management doses keeping me away from pain. The next day morning I was made to walk, yes you heard it was the very next day and it was indeed surprising that I was doing absolutely fine and walked quite a distance with the Physio’s support (never expected this at all). Only disappointment was that there was no pain at all that day, all my expectation was in vain :). I got discharged on the second day. After a week I called up Dr. Chirag and expressed the expectation that I had and I asked Doctor, how can there be no paint at all? He smiled and said, that’s why people get their ACL surgery done with me. I must also stress on the fact that Dr. Chirag leaves no stone unturned in terms of taking care of his patients, I have been in touch with him for 8 months now, I am able to jog, jump and squat. I am really blessed and fortunate to have the ACL surgery done by him. He guides you at every step on the journey to progress and the upcoming milestones, to top it all his patience is that of a Saint for the number of patients he has and he operates on a day to day basis. **** *** **** **** **** ** *** ** ** ************* *** *** ****** * **** *** * ********* Thank you Doctor for what you have done, I will remain thankful to you forever

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Meniscus Injury,ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"Visited Dr. Chirag with a left knee injury. He patiently  listened & allowed me to speak to give him all the details like how the injury happened, which part of my knee I had more pain etc. After analyzing my injury, with the help of knee model, he explained me in detail about my injury & what was the impacted of injury. After looking at the MRI scan, he did not rush & asked me undergo surgery immediately, but took 10 days’ time to analysis further with medication & some exercise. 

I had to undergo ACL & Meniscus balancing surgery. For Dr. Chirag his patients are more important to him, he takes care of them very well and treats them with utmost care. Either its pre or post-surgery, he make a point that his patients understand everything about the injury, surgery & medication by explaining even the smallest of the things that we need to know. He explained the procedures clearly & post operation what are step of recovery process and how long it will take by giving the timeline including the Physiotherapy process. He put me across to the best physiotherapists, he takes extra care of his patient by giving & getting the right treatment done his patients.

Dr. Chirag has a wonderful team, they made me to feel so comfortable & helpful during my stay in hospital. I would like to Thank all the team members of Doctor & special call out to Mrs. Yasmin for all her support, right from day one.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Osteotomy,",0,0,YES,"""God only had sent you to the Dr Chirag Thonse"". Said, my friend. I told myself that how he was so right I thanked God and Dr Chirag.
Dr Chirag treated me with orthoscopy and HTO surgery on my right knee successfully 15 days ago.
Long ago, I have got some meniscus injury but managed it with physio and regular exercises.  Over the last year, my pain has increased, and I referred the physio by an orthopaedic doctor. However, the pain has become medium severe over the previous two weeks.
I went back to the same reputed hospital, where I showed earlier. After seeing the X-ray, the orthopaedic surgeon has advised me for the total knee replacement as an only option. With my shock, I agreed to the surgery immediately, but somehow, I was not convinced, considering my X-ray report.
My friends, known doctors and relatives have advised me for a second opinion. Also, I enquired from several patients who underwent such surgeries. Finally, I have referred to Dr Chirag firmly to have a second opinion before the knee replacement.
Dr Chirag has seen my X-ray and examines my knee movements physically, and at the outset, he said, you are not the candidate for the knee joint replacement. However, to decide the proper treatment, he asked me for an immediate MRI.
Ruling out total knee replacement, He gave me the right option for minimum invasive surgery to repair my Meniscus and bone realignment through arthroscopy and HTO, respectively.
After two weeks of the successful surgery, I am recovering well and feeling relieved with the postoperative procedure.
What I felt best with my treatment experience with Dr Chirag is his approach to conserve the natural knee joint as much as possible, correct diagnosis of the problem and treatment, a huge passion for his field, and his and his team's professionalism.
I admire him a lot *** ***** *** ** *** **** *********** ******** ********* ********* ** *******My gratitude to you, Dr Chirag!
