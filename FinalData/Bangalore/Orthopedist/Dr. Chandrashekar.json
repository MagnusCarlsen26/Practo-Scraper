I underwent open heart surgery over 9 years ago and also having LS problem. The problem of osteoarthritis started nearly 18 years ago which has become very severe during the last 3 years. There was pain and deformity in both knees, difficultly in walking and climbing stairs. Doctors at Visakhapatnam advised TKR.\n As my children are staying in Bangalore I came here for consultation and treatment. Through internet and other sources, we came to know about the orthopedic surgeon Dr. Chandrashekar P. of SAKRA World Hospital.\nWe called on him for the first time on 12th April 2017. After seeing my X-rays and reports and other physical examination Dr. Chandrashekar advised for TKR. He was kind enough to spare about 45 minutes for us. He explained in detail step by step surgical procedures, pain management, post-operative care, physiotherapy, cost of package etc. He cleared all my doubts with regards to my existing diseases. He created hundred percent confidence in me for undergoing surgery without any fear. On my request, he also agreed to perform surgery as per our choice of auspicious date and time. \nHe informed us that the surgery will be done first for one leg and after 5 days basing on the advice of cardiologist surgery will be done for the second leg, otherwise it will be done after a gap of one or two months.\nThe positivity, professionalism and encouraging words of Dr. Chandrashekar inspired me very much and made me to decide then and there only to handover my case to him. I have not gone for even for a second medical opinion.\nI joined SARKA hospital on 11th May 2017 and the surgery was scheduled for 12th May 2017. On the morning of 12th May, the cardiologist checked up me and 2D echogram was done. Before the surgery Dr. Chandrashekar informed me that according to cardiologist my heart is in very good working condition and as such the surgery can be done for both the knees (bilateral) at a time. He explained about the advantages of a bilateral surgery. He also spoke to my family members and asked for consent. ** * **** ****** **** ************* **** ** *** **** ***** *** * ******** we agreed for bilateral surgery. Accordingly, bilateral surgery was done and I was discharged on 21st May 2017.\nDuring my stay in hospital the personal care and affection shown by Dr. Chandrashekar is highly commendable. He is so simple and humble and while talking with my family members we felt that as if he is our own family member. The doctor patient relationship is wonderful. At the time of discharge the doctor told my son to give SMS for any problem without any hesitation and will reply soon. Accordingly, he gave immediate responses to our 2/3 SMS\u2019s which boosted up our confidence levels. On our request, he suggested a physiotherapist who has done a wonderful job and made me fit well in advance to the scheduled target.\nI express my gratitude to Dr. Chandrashekar and his team of doctors, physiotherapists, nursing staff and others.\nI am a chronic patient having a couple of good doctor friends who are my spiritual colleagues. I have acquaintance with many doctors of various hospitals but I have never come across such a humble and patient caring doctor like Chandrashekar, maybe it is his nature by grace of God.\nThe surgery was successful, by the end of 4th week I was able to walk without assistance and also climbing stairs for which I shall be ever grateful to Dr. Chandrashekar.\nI feel that the existence of eminent doctors like Chandrashekar in SAKRA, the image of SAKRA hospital will increase to a great extent.\nI humbly pray my sadguru, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi to bestow his gracious blessings on Dr. Chandrashekar and his family for a long life, health, wealth and prosperity.\n\u201cTAT SAT\u201d\"\n",

I have been under ayurvedic treatment for last 1 year in various ayurvedic hospitals. We (the family members) met Dr Chandrashekar in December 2019 and the doctor had recommended for surgery, but we were not ready at that time. Subsequently, we had enquired about the surgery with other patients who had undergone surgery and also on the internet and decided to have the surgery.  Unfortunately, due to COVID19 pandemic, we postponed our decision. As the situation worsened further we met Dr Chandrashekar at his clinic on the first week of October for consultation. After examining my condition, he suggested going for immediate surgery. Accordingly, I got admitted at Sakra World Hospital on the 9th of October after a COVID test. MRI and X-Ray investigation revealed more problems with my right hip and doctor suggested to go ahead with hip replacement surgery rather than knee replacement surgery. We were convinced by doctors explanation and gave consent for hip replacement surgery. On 10th October 2020, the surgery was successfully done. After the surgery, I was kept in post-operative ward for a while and thereafter shifted to ICU where I was well attended by doctors and the support staff. On 11th I was shifted to the room for follow up and treatment. After the surgery, I stayed in the hospital for 7 days, where I received good care and attention. \n\nWe are extremely happy with the service provided at the hospital and particularly Dr Chandrshekhar and his team of doctors, physiotherapists, nursing staff etc.\n\nOn the 27th we came for the removal of the stitch. By the time the wound was completely healed and I was able to walk with a walker. We met the doctor again after 30 days on the 10th of November. I was able to walk without any walking aids and the doctor and we were extremely happy with the results.\n\nDr Chandrashekar possesses a charismatic character *** ** ** ********* ******* *** did my surgery professionally giving sincere care daily while I was in the hospital.\n\nWe thank Dr Chandrashekar and his team for the successful surgery and recovery.\n\n\nWith best regards,\nPrema M Nair and family.",

After 2 months when I saw my condition is detoring, I went to one more doctor here and he asked for an mri. To my bad bad luck it was a complete acl tear. ..

I am a rheumatoid arthritis patient, the doctor took care of me very well. The doctor examined me and referred me to rheumatologist in Sakra Hospital with whom I consulted and after seeing all the reports including the MRI on both occasions because of extreme discomforts that I was having prior to the surgery, he took his decision which was very consultative course actually he allowed me to alive at the conclusion rather than the doctor himself imposing decisions with me, the precious when I went to him to show for my shoulder it was a second consultation because the previous surgeon has told for replacement whereas Dr. Chandrashekhar examined me and said to avoid shoulder replacement he said I can give a try and he managed to do that and avoided shoulder replacement that gave me confidence doctor done through diagnosis and does not resort to replacement which very patient is worried about he just does that what good for the patients.",

I underwent open heart surgery over 9 years ago and also having LS problem. The problem of osteoarthritis started nearly 18 years ago which has become very severe during the last 3 years. There was pain and deformity in both knees, difficultly in walking and climbing stairs. Doctors at Visakhapatnam advised TKR.\n As my children are staying in Bangalore I came here for consultation and treatment. Through internet and other sources, we came to know about the orthopedic surgeon Dr. Chandrashekar P. of SAKRA World Hospital.\nWe called on him for the first time on 12th April 2017. After seeing my X-rays and reports and other physical examination Dr. Chandrashekar advised for TKR. He was kind enough to spare about 45 minutes for us. He explained in detail step by step surgical procedures, pain management, post-operative care, physiotherapy, cost of package etc. He cleared all my doubts with regards to my existing diseases. He created hundred percent confidence in me for undergoing surgery without any fear. On my request, he also agreed to perform surgery as per our choice of auspicious date and time. \nHe informed us that the surgery will be done first for one leg and after 5 days basing on the advice of cardiologist surgery will be done for the second leg, otherwise it will be done after a gap of one or two months.\nThe positivity, professionalism and encouraging words of Dr. Chandrashekar inspired me very much and made me to decide then and there only to handover my case to him. I have not gone for even for a second medical opinion.\nI joined SARKA hospital on 11th May 2017 and the surgery was scheduled for 12th May 2017. On the morning of 12th May, the cardiologist checked up me and 2D echogram was done. Before the surgery Dr. Chandrashekar informed me that according to cardiologist my heart is in very good working condition and as such the surgery can be done for both the knees (bilateral) at a time. He explained about the advantages of a bilateral surgery. He also spoke to my family members and asked for consent. ** * **** ****** **** ************* **** ** *** **** ***** *** * ******** we agreed for bilateral surgery. Accordingly, bilateral surgery was done and I was discharged on 21st May 2017.\nDuring my stay in hospital the personal care and affection shown by Dr. Chandrashekar is highly commendable. He is so simple and humble and while talking with my family members we felt that as if he is our own family member. The doctor patient relationship is wonderful. At the time of discharge the doctor told my son to give SMS for any problem without any hesitation and will reply soon. Accordingly, he gave immediate responses to our 2/3 SMS\u2019s which boosted up our confidence levels. On our request, he suggested a physiotherapist who has done a wonderful job and made me fit well in advance to the scheduled target.\nI express my gratitude to Dr. Chandrashekar and his team of doctors, physiotherapists, nursing staff and others.\nI am a chronic patient having a couple of good doctor friends who are my spiritual colleagues. I have acquaintance with many doctors of various hospitals but I have never come across such a humble and patient caring doctor like Chandrashekar, maybe it is his nature by grace of God.\nThe surgery was successful, by the end of 4th week I was able to walk without assistance and also climbing stairs for which I shall be ever grateful to Dr. Chandrashekar.\nI feel that the existence of eminent doctors like Chandrashekar in SAKRA, the image of SAKRA hospital will increase to a great extent.\nI humbly pray my sadguru, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi to bestow his gracious blessings on Dr. Chandrashekar and his family for a long life, health, wealth and prosperity.\n\u201cTAT SAT\u201d\"\n",

I have been under ayurvedic treatment for last 1 year in various ayurvedic hospitals. We (the family members) met Dr Chandrashekar in December 2019 and the doctor had recommended for surgery, but we were not ready at that time. Subsequently, we had enquired about the surgery with other patients who had undergone surgery and also on the internet and decided to have the surgery.  Unfortunately, due to COVID19 pandemic, we postponed our decision. As the situation worsened further we met Dr Chandrashekar at his clinic on the first week of October for consultation. After examining my condition, he suggested going for immediate surgery. Accordingly, I got admitted at Sakra World Hospital on the 9th of October after a COVID test. MRI and X-Ray investigation revealed more problems with my right hip and doctor suggested to go ahead with hip replacement surgery rather than knee replacement surgery. We were convinced by doctors explanation and gave consent for hip replacement surgery. On 10th October 2020, the surgery was successfully done. After the surgery, I was kept in post-operative ward for a while and thereafter shifted to ICU where I was well attended by doctors and the support staff. On 11th I was shifted to the room for follow up and treatment. After the surgery, I stayed in the hospital for 7 days, where I received good care and attention. \n\nWe are extremely happy with the service provided at the hospital and particularly Dr Chandrshekhar and his team of doctors, physiotherapists, nursing staff etc.\n\nOn the 27th we came for the removal of the stitch. By the time the wound was completely healed and I was able to walk with a walker. We met the doctor again after 30 days on the 10th of November. I was able to walk without any walking aids and the doctor and we were extremely happy with the results.\n\nDr Chandrashekar possesses a charismatic character *** ** ** ********* ******* *** did my surgery professionally giving sincere care daily while I was in the hospital.\n\nWe thank Dr Chandrashekar and his team for the successful surgery and recovery.\n\n\nWith best regards,\nPrema M Nair and family.",

I am a rheumatoid arthritis patient, the doctor took care of me very well. The doctor examined me and referred me to rheumatologist in Sakra Hospital with whom I consulted and after seeing all the reports including the MRI on both occasions because of extreme discomforts that I was having prior to the surgery, he took his decision which was very consultative course actually he allowed me to alive at the conclusion rather than the doctor himself imposing decisions with me, the precious when I went to him to show for my shoulder it was a second consultation because the previous surgeon has told for replacement whereas Dr. Chandrashekhar examined me and said to avoid shoulder replacement he said I can give a try and he managed to do that and avoided shoulder replacement that gave me confidence doctor done through diagnosis and does not resort to replacement which very patient is worried about he just does that what good for the patients.",

We did a quick research and discovered Dr. Chandrashekar at Sakra Hospital. Since my case was severe, I was quite apprehensive about an impeding surgery. However, after meeting Dr. Chandrashekar all anxieties were dispelled. He observed my case thoroughly and suggested imagining scans before recommending a knee replacement as the last resort. \n*** ******* ** ***** ** *** *** **** ************* competent, and kind surgeon. Right up to the day of the surgery he assured and reassured me of a successful recovery. A year later, I am fit as a fiddle and helping my husband through his knee replacement.\nMy husband\u2019s case was a rather complicated one since he is a diabetes, heart and cancer patient. Therefore, we had made sure that none other than Dr. Chandrashekar should handle his case, and the doctor did so with utmost kindness and dexterity. For a few days following the surgery, my husband\u2019s condition was quite delicate due to a series of complications. Dr. Chandrashekar kept a hawk\u2019s eye on his condition and made sure that he was discharged only after stabilising safely.\nIt has been 3 months since the surgery and my husband is finally gaining his healthy gait. All thanks to the gem of a person and an extraordinarily competent doctor, Dr. Chandrashekar. A special mention to the Sakra Hospital's ICU team for offering vigilant care throughout the duration of the treatment.",

I would say that it was pure luck that i landed into the hospital where Dr Chandrashekar is HOD, Ortho. The nature of my injury mandated a surgery, which was to be conducted by Dr Chandrashekar. Before the surgery, Dr Chandrashekar had an interaction with me, putting me at ease, saying that he will fix my elbow. He also properly explained me the condition of my elblow, along with the restrictions that i might have subsequently, given my injury. Thankfully, i had a pretty successful surgery. Dr Chandrashekar then recommended me to a physiotherapist -- after a couple of months of physio sessions, i was able to get almost complete range of motion in my hand, thus exceeding the expectations of even the surgeon! I have now started my strengthening exercises, and apart from some stiffness, which is expected, am able to use my right hand for all my work.\n\nI would say, given the nature and complexity of my injury, along with the fact that it was my right hand that got injured, i am greatly indebted to my surgeon who saved me from a major handicap for the rest of my life. In spite of being a pretty busy doctor, i could always get his time for all my subsequent check-ups. He would listen to all my queries patiently, and answer them to my satisfaction. Another point that i would like to make is that he would also reply to my queries that i would text him over the phone. He would get back without fail!\n\nI will always be indebted to Dr Chandrashekar for giving me the medical treatment and advice which helped me overcome an injury that could have affected my quality of life for the rest of my life.",

After meeting Dr Chandrashekhar, I found him very convincing,confident and ready to take overall responsibility.\n\n\nThe doctor sucessfully operated both my knees together after proper evaluation. Because of medical condition, I went through some post surgicalproblems like low homoglobin due to excessive bleeding, extreme gastro problem due to non tolerance of pain killers and excessive swelling in left leg causing lot of pain. For each of these problems and every other step, Dr. Chandrashekhar was extremely approachable, and sensitive. He took complete responsibility and solved every issue promptly, including non-surgery and non-orthopaedic related issues. He replied\u00a0 and acted immediately on every SMS and telephone\u00a0 and was available 24 hours for that.\n\n\nMy family and I found him an excellent doctor and a great human being, someone who takes complete ownership and is extremely reliable. I would always\u00a0 go back to him for advice and highly recommend to one and all.",

Besides his technical excellence, he possesses the following qualities, which are rarely observed these days: (a) extremely patient, I am yet to see his impatience ! Answers all your queries patiently without bothering about the time being spent (b) he is accessible throughout - before the surgery for any queries, visits you every day without fail during hospital stay and post discharge for any kind of help (c) he owns the patient till he gets discharged though the patient may develop other complications (they belong to other disciplines/departments) i.e. he front ends the patient and coordinates with other doctors and sees the complication gets resolved (d) genuine i.e. does the required treatment only (e) friendly, puts you at ease (f) goes out of the way and helps, if required.\n\nPlease note that there is no exaggeration here.\n\nWe are fortunate to be associated with the doctor.

Thank you very much for all that you have done to me.\nV. Subrahmanya Sastry\nBangalore\n   ",

Before meeting him, I got a consultation for my mom in the other two hospitals basically for her Knee replacement and her age is 71. As soon as we had a consultation at Sakra, by seeing her Xray, Doctor explained the condition. So we decided the date for her surgery on March 16th,2020. Luckily my mom never had any health issues except Knee's problem. Her both Knee replacement was done on the same day by Dr Chandrashekar. Everything went well and I met my mom in the recovery room soon after her surgery. I never felt bad about doing any small paperwork or running around because I was pretty sure and happy that approached the right doctor after doing some research. Doctor visited my mom every day and his humbleness, caring and talking to patient's family members with ease was so amazing. That boosted up my confidence level so much even after the surgery that my mom will recover soon. The team worked so well, and she was discharged just a day before the lockdown. I have to truly talk about the Physiotherapist Aneesh, who came to my home like a God. He underwent so much trouble during the initial lockdown time because police were not letting him come due to COVID . with all the hurdles, he makes sure visiting my mother everyday.Such a young and energetic person ,well suited for this profession with full of kindness.  His advice and exercise made my mom to feel better and better. After 2 weeks, Dr Renganath came home with another person to remove my mom\u2019s sutures. This is something unbelievable and amazing support provided by the team and hospital. They said due to Covid, don\u2019t bring the patient to hospital, we will come home to remove the suture. I never ever heard such support from any hospital in my lifetime. Truly amazing doctor, support and service . Now my mother is able to walk normally , she can sit comfortable, able to claim stairs and back to her routine lifestyle. I am thankful to god that I went to the right place for the surgery. I simply recommend anyone have the knee problem, pls visit Dr Chandrashekar P.\n\nI took  my mom 2 weeks ago to see an Xray , and everything was perfect and doctor said she will not have problem for another 20 years. Doctor was showing all my moms, pics and videos shared by the Aneesh and how they follow up until the person recover fully . Doctor was so happy seeing my mother walking and I could realize his happiness true from his heart.\n",

He presents the entire operation scenario with minimal activity. So, the response always makes more easier for the patient and as well as family, feel a very easy process so that is very important the patient is looking for. Most of the Orthopedist in the market whom I have met are very serious individuals which are business oriented but I think over here the doctor whose present make friendly atmosphere, doctor is very good friend of mine whenever I text him he responds and I have sent so many people and most of them got a very good feedback, he is pretty good I kindly respect him, I remember I had a huge issue with the hospital facilities but just one phone call it just got sorted. So, he is very important as you feel you're under safe hands so that's a very big thing.",

Although, when I stepped out of his office I was overflowing with confidence that I would be able to walk without pain again.\".\nHis positivity and encouraging words fill the patient with joy and hope.\nIn the words of SN Indiramma,our mother,\" If anybody ever asks for an orthopedic consult, the only answer I'll ever have is Dr. Chandrashekar at sakra hospital.\".",

She was having pain since 4-5 years and consulted quite a few doctors and almost all the doctors suggested for knee replacement surgery but she was scared to go for surgery. We tried convincing her a lot but she never agreed for it. After consulting doctor Chandrashekhar, she was so happy with the way doctor gave her comfort and communicated that she finally agreed to get the surgery done. Surgery is successfully done and I'm really thankful to doctor. I have not come across such an experienced doctor who is so friendly and helpful. Further very happy with Sakra Hospital where surgery was done.",

When I met him, the first word he uttered was \"Sorry dear to make you wait\" \nI was blown away from his down to earth attitude.\nHe clearly explained the need for the surgery and detailed out the entire procedure. He answered all my questions very politely to my satisfaction. What I understood in a short period is he treats all his patients with at most care and patience. ",

We felt it was convenient to take to a hospital rather than a clinic to prevent the hassle of multiple transportations of an injured adult. Sakra arranged emergency ambulance on short notice, the emergency care doctors also did a quick diagnosis to identify a fracture and referred us to the right doctor for minor surgery.\n\nDr. Chandrasekhar attended to my grandmother's case and we are very much satisfied with his procedure and her quick recovery. I also met him once and his detailed explanation on post-discharge care is to be much appreciated. \n\nI would also like to appreciate the support provided by Ranganathan from Sakra's TPA desk who gave excellent support and guidance throughout the hospitalization period. \n\nThe only thing I would recommend to be improved is the nursing section, where the staff needs to be more responsive and attentive to patient's needs.\n\nregs,\nKarthik\n",

After the X ray,  we were told that the doctor will see me in 20 minutes as he is in theatre.  But within 10 minutes,  i was taken to the doctor.  Doctor was very friendly,  explained the nature of my issue snd put us at ease by saying,  though there are degenerative changes, ruled out surgery at this stage.  Explained how I should tske care of the knee and advisef to go for physiotherapy.  Also prescribed mefs.  At the rehab centre,  the lady who assisted me,  Ganga,  was very helpful and pleadant.  She promisef to give me a the list of exervises to be done,  but couldnt as the printer was not working.  She took my e mail id to mail the same to me, and I am waiting for that though I did some of the exercises from my memory.  Kerp uo the good work.  Thank you\n",

Here they carefully reviewed history and all previous reports and ruled out spine related problems. Suggested total knee replacement as it was causing more pain that can be mistaken for spine issues. They clearly explained the degenerative process and I was convinced over correctness of diagnosis and urgent need for knee replacement. Planning it with the same doctor and would highly recommend him for patients having any orthopedic problems.",

I had a feeling i may not be able to walk properly, may not be able participate in sports. Dr. Chandrasekhar did a wonderful surgery. His magical hands did everything right for me. Followed by a wonderful team of Physiotherapy (Satish). I could recover completely within 6 months regaining complete ROM. Able to walk,climb stair cases without any support. Soon will be running on treadmill. I am very happy. Thanks to Dr. Chandrasekhar *** *** ********* **********",

He has taken very well care of me during my emergency. I recommend him and Sakra to everyone. Patients comfort and care were very well addressed and my whole family is very happy with the treatment. Treatment and surgery were advanced and equivalent to the foreign technology. Compared to many well known corporate hospitals, the cost was less.  Even my physiotherapists here in Bangalore and back in my home town highly appreciated the treatment and the doctor *** ** ***** ***** ** ** *** **** ******* and I was very well operated.

As luck (good luck) had it at right time I was shifted to Sakra hospital near belandur and was treated by Dr. Chandrasekhar. P, who is excellent doctor and very careful in handling patients. I really thank him for treating me immediately And giving me proper information on my condition, fracture status, and post surgery how to ensure a good recovery. Best part of him as a doctor is that he is very caring, and careful. He has lot of patience and also tells the patients to give proper time required for a recovery thereby avoiding unnecessary medications, and cost. I should also mention that the other support doctors and staff were equally helpful and good. Its been a year and I have recovered and able to walk well and have no pain. Extremely satisfied with Dr Chandrashekhar's treatment. He is more like a family to us now.Overall an excellent doctor and I would recommend him to everyone",

For the last 2-3 years she started using stick while walking. It was extremely painful for her while going up or coming down using stairs.\nWe went to consult the Dr. Chandrashekar, after looking at the reports, she explains the situation and convinced my mom for surgery. He was so well in explaining the current issue, future problems which may come and how to resolve it. His personal involvement with patients makes the difference.\nShe was convinced and we admitted her for the surgery. It was around 10 days she was in hospital. She started walking after a month. Now, she is improving every day. Her quality of life is really improved.\nI would like to thank Dr. Chandrashekar and his team specially Dr. Ranga who was always available over phone, whatsapp, messages to help. I am really touched by the team. The coordinator Ms. Sriparna, the nurses, ward boys and girls are also very cooperative  and sincere. ",

We got the surgery on 8/12/18 and stayed 7 days in hospital. During these days, everything has been taken care really well. And my dad didn\u2019t really feel unbearable pain once we got discharged. Sakra has good facilities for home care physiotherapists, Our physio Mr Udai is also a really nice guy. \n\nOn a conclusion note, Dr Chandrashekhar is awesome and friendly in explaining all things before the surgery and gave us hope that he will take care of everything, which is what happened. Post surgery we met him after a month as the standard procedure, and he assured and confirmed everything being well. It is really great to have Dr Chandrashekhar as the surgeon who took care of everything really splendid. Have taken a picture of Dr with my dad on a conclusion note which is nice.\n\nKeep up the good work, our all wishes with you, keep plugging away!",

It was pure luck that i landed into the Sakra hospital where Dr Chandrashekar is HOD, Ortho.Before the surgery, Dr Chandrashekar had an interaction with me and my parents, putting us at ease, saying that he will fix my right elbow. He also properly explained me the condition of my right hand.Thanks to Dr Chandrashekar because of him i had a successful surgery. Dr Chandrashekar then recommended me to do physiotherapy resulting to which i was able to get almost complete range of motion in my hand.\nlooking to the complexity of my injury, along with the fact that it was my right hand that got injured, i am greatly indebted to my surgeon who saved me from a major handicap for the rest of my life. inspite of his busy schedule he would listen to all my queries patiently, and answer them to my satisfaction. ** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** *****He saved my life.i am really thankful to him from the bottom of my heart His sincerity,devotion to the profession is 500/100.Wishing him all the best!!!!",

Day 1 was disaster as I spent couple of hour doing preliminary stuff and waiting for him as he was busy in OT which I understand is important. He asked for MRI to be done but someone should have told me that it is based on appointment and I will not get reports same day. MRI happened only at 4 pm and without the report dr. Refused to see me as films would not help him. Not sure why. I was asked to come at 9 next day which I can\u2019t as I have other obligations. I came at 10:30 and still waiting for dr. I have been told he will see me at 11:45. Let\u2019s see for a bone bruise how much longer I need to wait. As I said dr. is really good but all the management around him is not at all structured. For major issues I will recommend him but minor stuff unless you have days to spare you are better off at other place.",

It's almost 8 months after surgery and she still going through pain but there is no issue with surgery but I think it's her body taking a lot of time in terms of recovering, did PKR surgery.",
