My name is Navya and I am a marathon runner. On March 14th 2021, I reached home, after running 10K in the nearby ground and started plucking flowers. I fell from the wall and fractured right leg near ankle (shattered my calcaneus bone). We visited almost each and every orthopedic surgeon‚Äôs office in my home town. Each one of those doctors said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do surgery but they can put hard cast (plaster of Paris) around the fractured leg and it will heel on itself‚Äù. They also said, ‚ÄúGetting back to normal walking style is difficult and you won‚Äôt be able to run again‚Äù. These words (won‚Äôt be able to run again) hurt me more than the physical pain from fracture. It was like Sun setting in the West and never rising in the East. Felt like, my life turned upside down forever. 
We (me and my husband, also a marathon runner) explored all the options and called each and every doctor we knew personally. My cousin (a Gynecologist) and her husband (also a Doctor) posted about my case in almost every Doctor‚Äôs group they knew. Most of the Doctors in those groups referred Dr. Darshan Kumar as the best Orthopedic surgeon to consult. 
Based on my cousin‚Äôs reference, I consulted Dr. Darshan Kumar. He assured me saying ‚ÄúThis is a very complicated fracture, don‚Äôt worry I handled much more complicated ones and be positive‚Äù. Doctor performed the surgery in a very deliberate manner for couple of hours. As soon as operation is done, doctor told my husband, ""You want her to run again, don‚Äôt worry we will make her run again"".
Dr. Darshan Kumar is a terrific, ************** sensitive, confident, caring, informative provider that I have complete faith and trust in. I trusted him so much that I didn‚Äôt consult physiotherapy doctor during my recovery and simply followed his suggestions. He is great with his patients and he gives you all the time you need during an office visit and makes sure all of your concerns and questions are addressed. He truly cares about his patients. Dr. Darshan sir combines expertise and a willingness to listen and discuss. He‚Äôs very empathetic and listens to our concerns. He takes time with the patient to help them with their issues. 
He has been with us at every stage of the recovery and am very thankful for his excellent diagnosis and a pitch perfect operation. Really efficient, on point, respectful and great personality. Hands-down the most effective and efficient doctor visits I‚Äôve had.
Through his staff, we came to know Vajubhai Vala, the then Governor of Karnataka was treated by Dr. Darshan Kumar when the Governor fractured his finger in Raj Bhavan Garden. Some foreigners visit him regularly. Some athletes (His name is Subhash) were able to compete at national level after successful surgeries by Dr. Darshan Kumar. 
On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most severe damage) my fracture is rated 10 by all doctors. Where ever I am in the future, I will be very grateful to the doctor, because of him, I am able to walk normally and run normally. I am posting this review on the first day I am able to run again. I am indebted to Dr. Darshan for making me run again and for helping me to lead a normal life again. 
Dr. Darshan Kumar is well known for his skills, compassion, empathetic, commitment and very well updated with his excellence in Orthopedics, so I recommend Dr. Darshan Kumar in a heartbeat to anyone looking for ***** Orthopedic Surgeon‚Äù.

,,0,0,YES,"Hi,

My Fatger-In-Law aged 72 Yrs ia an farmer and was suffering from Dupuytren Contracture in both the hands since almost 7-10 yrs and his few figures were bent alomst till his palm. 

I had took him to the various Ortho Surgeons of many famous hospitals in Bengaluru **** **** ****** ******* ******* ****** *** *** **** ********* ******* ******** and suggestion was from all the Surgeons were one hand can be operated easily and can be recovered soon but another hand operation is little severe and need to do grafting and cannot promise on functioninig of the affected fingures post surgery and even chances of removal of fingures if those are not functional or lost sensitivity post surgery. 

Recently, I had been referred to Dr.Darshan Kumar A Jain by one of the Ortho Dr. having small clinic at my native and I met Dr.Darshan Jain at his Malleshwaram clinic along with my Father-In-Law. Always the first impression will be either the Best or worse, likewise, we had a very best impression by Dr.Darshan Jain in our first visit. 

Dr.Darshan Jain is an Compassionate, Humble and Explanative on the problem and procedure and even he promised us that both the hands will be operated with 100% confidence of normal functioning of all affected figures post surgery whereas grafting may required for one hand which is little severe. 

Finally, we had surgery for both hands one after another over a period of 1 month time with interval of 15 days from first hand surgery. 

As promised by Dr.Darshan Jain he has completed the surgery and procedure of both the hands successfully with 100% functioning of both hands like earlier and that to be surprisingly without Grafting for severe one also keeping in mind of my Father-In-Law's health condition as he was an heart patient with Diabetic. 

I would strongly recommend all the needy person who are seeking Orthopedic Surgery/Orthopedic Treatment/Advice on Ortho related issues to visit Dr.Darshan Jain at least once for better treatment and solutions; he is the best Orthopedic Surgeon ever I seen, as I had met more than 15 Orthopedic Surgeons in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shimoga and Manipal over a period of 2 years and we never had confidence of re-functioning of affected figures by any of the Orthopedic Surgeons whom we met except Dr.Darshan Jain and even my Father-In-Law is doing normal farming work post surgery whereas earlier he could not mix the food while eating, hold the pen to write etc... 

Once again I reiterate, meet Dr.Darshan Jain at least once and get rid of your Orthopedic problems.
