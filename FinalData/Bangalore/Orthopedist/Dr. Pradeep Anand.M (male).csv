"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"My problem was back pain and as far as consultations go, it was great. He understood my problem, asked questions and    made me show him the pain triggers and prescribed medication. What I liked most was he was able to answer my questions and addressed my concerns straightaway which was very helpful and I worried that the doctor would not take this seriously and just prescribe some pain killers for immediate effect but no long-term plan, he did prescribe painkillers but told me this could very well be something really wrong and we need to monitor and continue our investigation if the pain persists and/or I don't see any improvement. He also booked a follow up appointment just in case and gave me his contact details to reach out in case the pain becomes severe which is more than I expected.
