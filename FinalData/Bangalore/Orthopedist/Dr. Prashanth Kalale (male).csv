None,None,0,0,YES,"I went to Dr.Prashanth with Distal Radius Fracture on my right hand.I got the injury while running and subsequently falling across the railway line at Carmelaram,Sarjapur road.
Once I reached the Apollo Clinic on Sarjapur Road,Doctor immediately told me this is a fracture and gave me the various options for treatment.He explained to me how much time it would take the fracture to heal and the nature of healing process.By looking at the fracture after Xray, Doctor advised that a small procedure would be required to make the fracture heal correctly.This 'day' procedure was to be conducted at Apollo Spectre Hospital Kormangala.Doctor explained to me the exact procedure and its after effects and also helped me coordinate with the correct contacts at Apollo Spectre Hospital.The procedure was to pull the bones with Wires,under anesthesia and live xray so that there is no malalignment of bones upon healing.After the procedure Doctor called me for followup in 2 weeks and an X ray was done on to check whether the healing is proper.Next followup was in 4 weeks time,when Doctor removed the full plaster and confirmed with an X ray that healing was in the right direction.At this moment a half plaster was applied on my hand which continued until 7 weeks.At the end of 7 weeks Doctor confirmed with an Xray that my hand has healed 85 to 90 % and now I can move my hand with wrist movements and also start physiotherapy exercises for completing the healing process. Now my Wrist has completely recovered and I am pleased by the Professionalism  shown by the Doctor throughout the fracture healing stage.I also admire him to answer all my and my family queries during each stages of the treatment and also empathize with me on the mental aspect of being mentally down after fracture.His kind words instilled confidence in me.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hand Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Visited Dr.Prashanth for the treatment of fracture of my left wrist (intra-articular fracture of left distal radius).

Surgery done by Dr.Prashanth was perfect (I being from the family of Doctors, I even took opinion from other Doctors and other Ortho Surgeons and all of them told by looking at x-ray that it's perfectly fixed) and even the medications prescribed by him worked very well and helped in effective management of post surgery pain. Even after the surgery, Dr.Prashanth has been very approachable and easily available to answer queries on whatsapp. Today is 4th week since the surgery and I feel a lot better. I religiously followed all instructions of Dr. Prashanth and did fingers and hand exercises and the range of movement in my fingers and wrist is quite improved now. Got my x-ray done again today after 4th week and the bone fixation is perfect.

He advises of exercises and this is something I liked the most as I believe our body should be tried for self healing rather than medications.

He has never prescribed costly medicines, which is again an unfair practice by other doctors now-a-days.

He will ask for the tests like X-rays, MRI, etc. only when the medicines give no results after a defined time span.

My 1st impression was not so good, I felt he talks too much. After 2 days, things did not get improved, rather knee started swelling. I went to a big hospital in Bellandur, where doctor consultation fees are very high. Before giving any advice, doctor asked to get x-ray and MRI done. Those tests are too expensive and time consuming. On receiving reports, doctor scared me by saying knee has to be operated. I came back and continued medication given by Dr. Prashanth. In few days I completely recovered and since then last 3 years I did not feel any issue with my knee.
My daughter is very tall compare to her age and she is in school basketball team. Once she fell down on knee and then frequently she used to complain about knee pain; we also observed knee swelling.
