None,None,0,0,YES,"I had met with accident recently and when i was  strugling on road one girl actually refered me Doctor Shiva Kumar and i fell it as  God's Instinct .
I am such Panic person who does not visit hospital even if any of my family members admitted in  Hospital.I am very furious seeing different patients in Hospitals.

Doctor Shiva Kumar,is one of the best caring doctors and he actually made me in comfort zone and he  explained clearly  the procedure what he will be going through and which precautions the patient needs to go through which really helped me to recover soon.

Differnet Stages of Recovery:
1.Before Surgery
2.During Surgery
3.After Surgery

Before Surgery : My Bike fallen on my rightleg and which really was not helping me to stand and i was under impression doctor will just wrap my leg and i should be good togo home.
But from my X-ray and CT scan i got to know Tibia bone got fractured and need to under go surgery and need to stay in Hospital for 3 days.
Doctor explained me what exactly he would be doing as part of surgery but i was soo furious .


During Surgery : I was given anesthesia and Plate and Rods were inserted  on my right leg for Tibia bone.
Surgery Took nearly 45 minutes and really i should thank this Doctor for just having stiches at 2 places instead of whole area .
i did not feel any pain during Surgery or even after post surgery alsoi did not have much pain  due to medicines .


After Surgery:
Koshys Hospital services was good and nurses provided all medications on time and room was kept clean ,they helped me with physiotheraphy for first 2 days.

Physiotherapy:
 I am blessed to have good physiotherapy lady and she was referred to me in Hospital.
She actually helped me to  do different exercises  and which really helped me recover from my pain little earlier .
Doctor also suggested me to do different exercise in my every visit.

Strongly suggest  Dr. Shiva Kumar for Ortho related Problems to anyone,
