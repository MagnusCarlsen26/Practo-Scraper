It was great shock to me and my family.\n\nDr.Mohan Sir guided me for first 25days to recover from my minor bone fractures, after that, he asked me to go for ligament reconstruction surgery.\n\n*21days after surgery*\nOn 9th March, I have undergone Ligament reconstruction surgery. After surgery, on the same day he spent good time with me and explained what are the treatments he has given during surgery, how my knee internal structure is going to after surgery.\nOn 10th March morning, he came to me and asked me to walk by keeping complete weight on my left leg, I was wondering! He told me that, \"your knee is fully ready and ligaments are fully reconstructed, confidently walk, pain will be there, I will give pain killer, dont worry\". I walked with brace and stand support.\nOn 11th march, he removed all the extra fittings added to my left leg during surgery and made me walk. He told me that, I can go home any time, I got discharged from hospital on 12th march.\non 24th he removed stitches and made me walk with only brace support and without any stand or stick support.\non 31st March, he made me walk without even brace support means without any support. He also made me walk using staircase with alternate steps. For this, he gave me so much confidence.\n\n*About Nursing and Supporting staff, Hospital environment:*\nNano hospitals is having wonderful Nursing and Supporting staff.\nNurses are very attentive and very kind.\nSupporting staff are very helpful, when ever I called, immediately they came and helped me to goto  rest room.\nI find every 3-4hrs supporting staff cleaning the rooms and rest rooms. Hospital is very Hygiene.\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE WITH DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL IS WONDERFUL. NOW I AM IN POSITION TO WALK ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT.\n\n\n\n\n",

Later on i came back and saw that doctor is not there and according to staff, doctor was supposed to visit around 5pm. \n\nI somehow skipped my office hours for this appointment and now i was with my xrays worth 1.4k but there was no doctor.\n\nSo my experience was very bad as \n\n1) I couldnt wait upto 5pm as office was there.\n2) what is the point of appointment if i am not getting treated in my booked time.\n3) Paid 300+1400 and felt like waste of money.\n\nI want practo take this feedback seriously.

It was great shock to me and my family.\n\nDr.Mohan Sir guided me for first 25days to recover from my minor bone fractures, after that, he asked me to go for ligament reconstruction surgery.\n\n*21days after surgery*\nOn 9th March, I have undergone Ligament reconstruction surgery. After surgery, on the same day he spent good time with me and explained what are the treatments he has given during surgery, how my knee internal structure is going to after surgery.\nOn 10th March morning, he came to me and asked me to walk by keeping complete weight on my left leg, I was wondering! He told me that, \"your knee is fully ready and ligaments are fully reconstructed, confidently walk, pain will be there, I will give pain killer, dont worry\". I walked with brace and stand support.\nOn 11th march, he removed all the extra fittings added to my left leg during surgery and made me walk. He told me that, I can go home any time, I got discharged from hospital on 12th march.\non 24th he removed stitches and made me walk with only brace support and without any stand or stick support.\non 31st March, he made me walk without even brace support means without any support. He also made me walk using staircase with alternate steps. For this, he gave me so much confidence.\n\n*About Nursing and Supporting staff, Hospital environment:*\nNano hospitals is having wonderful Nursing and Supporting staff.\nNurses are very attentive and very kind.\nSupporting staff are very helpful, when ever I called, immediately they came and helped me to goto  rest room.\nI find every 3-4hrs supporting staff cleaning the rooms and rest rooms. Hospital is very Hygiene.\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE WITH DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL IS WONDERFUL. NOW I AM IN POSITION TO WALK ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT.\n\n\n\n\n",
