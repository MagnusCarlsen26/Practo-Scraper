It’s not right on your part to comment that doctor I was talkative .. please clarify who was talkative yourself , receptionist or the doctor ?? 
I think that’s your perception issue and this is not the right platform to comment on any one personally. Regarding the waiting I guess you are exaggerating it as total duration of the appointment system itself does not extend to the extent of time you have mentioned. The doctor always obliged and sees the patients in severe pain and children , elderly or those with fracture are emergency. You are taking an appointment with a specialist who caters to so many other patients also and wen u have an emergency to your own near and dear one would understand the delay in the appointments.
That requires a bit of patience and understanding the medical  treatment. There are quite a few walk-in patients coming whom we do not refuse treatment. 

There are also practo patients who are reporting beyond the scheduled appointment and still claim that they have an appointment and fight with receptionist and we still try to accommodate them as walk in and not refuse to see them . Wetry to maintain the schedule as far as possible . This is our humble request to co operate with the consultation. 
It’s not a platform to discuss who is talkative who was fussy and who is dumb.
People come in all shapes sizes and colours and behavioural habits and no one is to judge any one. 
Regarding the test which came as normal. Please understand that the test is done to identify a possible problem. And test is negative is not something to be unhappy about. You should be happy if a test comes negative. In that case if we could know which test would come as positive or surely show a problem, we could only order such tests. But then it won’t be called as a test !!

Regarding the comment about x ray cost I don’t think this is a good platform to discuss this I think practo also should make a note of these feedback’s were patient comments personally about the doctor / cost etc 
U need to understand the market cost of a digital x rays and we are at par with the present market rates. 

If you are talking about the doctor being talkative , he needs to be talking to patients that’s an integral part of consultation. There are people who think doctor did not speak to them at length and then there are some who say he talks too much. After all we are all humans and we too have talkative / less talking patients which we never complain about. This profession involves dealing with people and they come in variety. So are the doctors.",2018-09-07T12:25:16+0000,Dr. Raviraj A
