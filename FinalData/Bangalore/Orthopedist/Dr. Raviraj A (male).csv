"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"
Dr Raviraj did the surgery in Apollo Hospital. The treatment in Apollo Hospital was very good and Dr Raviraj is a very friendly person, so the patient will feel much relaxed and confident. He said the exact time for the recovery which a patient should follow strictly and then he has recommended physiotherapy. I have done the follow up in his clinic which is located in Vijaya Bank Layout. That clinic is very good and clean. People are very helpful in the clinic. I highly recommend him for any orthopaedic problems.",2024-02-03 14:17:13,False,True,saraswati Nagarajan,,,
