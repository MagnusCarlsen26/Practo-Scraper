"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Lower Back Pain,",0,0,YES,"I found Dr. Sreedhar Singh on Practo while looking at orthopedists for my father with severe lower back pain. Though I could not get the appointment on same day due to public holiday, I had to book it for next day evening(Doctor is available at the clinic only from 5:30pm to 7:30pm).

On the appointment day we reached 10mins prior to our booking time (5:50pm) and there were already many people waiting in the clinic. The person at the reception desk took all the details about my father and when asked if we could go in to meet the doctor at our allotted time, he said we have to wait as he would be sending inside on FCFS basis( then what’s the use of booking the appointment online?) We patiently waited for an hour, where as the person at the desk sent 2-3 already known people(who had come after us) inside to meet the doctor. When asked, he said it’s a follow up to show X-ray / Operation cases etc and gave some excuses. Since it was our first visit and booked online he told us to wait and it would take time to meet the doctor as the clinic wasn’t open previous day. He didn’t even seem to care in spite of saying my father cannot sit for too long as he has back pain. He rudely said don’t keep asking again and have to wait till he says. I was so disappointed with his way of working and behaviour.

Finally, it was our time to meet the doctor. He was polite and good. Doctor communicated well with us and took the details of the ailment, when & how my father has the pain. He went through previous reports for the cause of pain and checked the affected parts thoroughly. Doctor was quick in understanding the problem and advised to go for a fresh X-ray report to diagnose the issue. Later he explained very clearly without any exaggeration on what’s happening and the cause for the pain with images( X-ray report displayed on his Comp Screen). Practically explained us the future course of treatment with medicines and physiotherapy(which is at the corner of the building). Medication and treatment suggested by the doctor seems to be simple and promising as my father is feeling better after two days of taking medicines & Physiotherapy. Hoping for the best. 

I would definitely recommended Dr. Sreedhar Singh to others with 4star ratings (-1 due to staff’s disappointing behaviour and bit heavy charges for the services like consultation, X-ray and Physiotherapy.)",2017-10-23 06:03:36,False,True,Mona Avinash ,,,

On my day of appointment- I visited the clinic and felt nice to find it neat, clean and peaceful & well maintained. After 20 minutes, I went to visit the doctor. He started off by asking concerns and was quick to understand the problem. The best part was that he not only treated us with medicines but also at cognitive/mental level. He encouraged us to make lifestyle changes and involve my Mother in outdoor activity (she is a housewife from 35 years and unfortunately has faced lot of health issues). He suggested that he will start his treatment but we as a family must motivate her, boost her confidence and change her environment. We loved his idea and from very next day we started incorporating these changes. And, I must admit it has really worked! Even though her treatment has just begun, Nowadays she is much happier and we as a family have also corrected our lifestyle habits. On our second visit (he suggested us to come with some Tests/ X-rays done) - he assured my Mother of no major health issues and that she should stay more happy & peaceful and take less tension.

1. The doctor has no clue how to speak to children or how to make their presence or experience pleasant.

IF children cannot accompany their parents inside he must display a board clearly mentioning the same.

2. The doctor's ability to interact with the patient patiently is very poor. probably he is busy but then he does get paid for his time.

3.The big unethical prescription, the doctor was informed that the patent was a hindu vegetarian, he has however prescribed a particular oral supplement which is derived from animal source and we realized this only after buying these medicines and because I can read english and the patient my mother does not, who would have swallowed the medicine as god send without knowing the source. How insensitive and unethical is this international doctor, he should be sued for negligence.

I visited this doctor at his clinic ""Bone & Joint Clinic"" which is 25 KM from my home for Right HIP joint pain and suspected benign bone lesion on Left femur.
Before visiting him we visited more Doctors but every time on pain killer my pain is relieved.
Mr. Singh also gave same pain killer which relieved while we take but again it started if I don't eat medicine.

He never explained that what type of this scan is and what is all process and what precautions we need to take before going for this test , except only one thing i.e. ""Full Body Scan to detect root cause of bone lesion and if any other place it is present or not"".

Next day we reached to ""Columbia Asia Hebbal"" to do the CT Scan at 9am. There we had to pay Mr. Singh's visiting charge and new registration and we were okay with that.
I asked him about Onco CT Scan but he was rushing too much but he didn't explain it properly.

     - > We have to do some blood test prior to it.
     - > Before CT Scan some kind of solution will be injected to my body. 
    - > Lastly he was not clear with the amount of this scan he said it will cost 4-5k but it actually it costed 8k.

Mr. Singh help me to get blood test report faster than expected and when I went for the CT Scan. I had to wait for more 1hr and the receptionist told me to ""PAY AFTER I AM DONE WITH CT SCAN"".
During this period I saw Mr. Singh was roaming here and there and then he took a newspaper and went to cafeteria and after sometime I saw him leaving the hospital. 

REMEMBER: He had assured previous day that he will be present there during the entire CT Scan.

After the CT scan is done I was to that it will take 3 hrs to generate the report so I ""PAID"" the amount and went to near by restaurant as me and my wife didn't had any thing since morning and that current time was 1.30pm.
After returning around 4 pm we got our report and then wanted to consult with Mr. Singh.
I know he sits at his personal chamber at around 4.30 pm which is around 4-5 km from the Columbia Asia Hebbal Hospital and our home is around 20KM far. So we decided to visit his chamber same day without any delay and we called to his reception and reception guy told us to come.

Dr. Singh puts cast in 2-phases costing Rs9000, until below calf irrespective of me reporting calf pain and suggesting Medically approved boot for Phase-2. Also asked for Physiotherapy to strengthen the muscles for Phase-2, but nothing. On top spent Rs8000 for 2 MRI’s due to wrong prescription (he wrote Ankle Joint instead of Achilles Tendon), which anyways Dr didn’t check or discuss.

23rd June, 2017, due to acute pain in the calf had to rush for Bangalore Baptist Hospital, Hebbal, where they had to cut my old cast and gave me the option of a full cast @ Rs2500 for another month or Rs9000 boot, along with Physiotherapy.
