"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hand Surgery,",0,0,YES,"2 surgeries have been done by dr kishan rao and we are waiting for another 2 surgeries to be done for my elder sister.
WE have heard a lot about the dr and the best part about him which i feel is, he believes in himself and always explains the problem accurately.
He shares only the necessary information.
I am sure he will rock the next 2 surgeries also.
Hoping to see my sister's hand setting in the next few days under his control.
