This earned him the impeccable reputation of delivering high quality orthopaedic care. To pursue the dream of taking world standard quality medical care to the masses, SPARSH Hospital was established in the year 2006 with 120 beds and 5 operating rooms with a capacity of carrying out over 30 surgeries a day. It has become a commitment to constantly explore opportunities and develop processes and systems by which healthcare could become affordable in India. Under his stewardship and within the short time span of just over five years, over 20,000 major surgeries have been performed on the lower-middle and middle class strata of society. Superspeciality teams of every branch of Orthopedics, Plastic and Maxillofacial surgery have been developed with a lead surgeon for each of the specialties. Over 20 consultants and 30 junior doctors work as a team at SPARSH Hospital practicing state-of-the- art medicine with the aim of becoming a leader amongst the orthopaedic fraternity.
