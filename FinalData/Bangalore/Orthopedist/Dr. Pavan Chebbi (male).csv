He also told that this situation can flare up her already existing osteo-arthritis. Also he told us about a possibility of a knee replacement in the near future. My mother managed the pain for few more months and when she had enough then we again consulted Dr Chebbi. As usual we had a lot of questions and doubts but all of them were answered by the doctor. In early March 2022 we had the total knee replacement surgery done and now in mid April she is doing better then we had expected. She’s walking independently, doing her chores, exercises with out much effort. We are great full that we happen to get a good doctor like Dr Chebbi.
