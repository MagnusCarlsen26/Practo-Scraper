I first met doctor for ACL tear, I had to undergo a surgery for this and trust me to this date I have never faced issues post the surgery and I do everything what I used to before the ACL tear. The experience, recommendation, suggestion and guidance provided during the surgery was way more than what I could expect. Doctor was very patient in explaining everything in detail that even to this date if somebody comes to with me an ACL tear I explain it to them what happens, how it goes and how my experience was.. So it's now 11 years post the surgery and everything is normal as before. After this I have consulted him numerous times, one of the experience I would like to share is with regards to the disc bulge issue, to keep it short, he is far better than any other doctor's because his treatment really helped me and after that I have never had issues which is really rare compared to the other people who I have known had had similar issues. . ****** ** **** ************* ** ***** *** **** ***** **** *** ********** ** ********* ***** ***** *** **** ***** ** ******* *** ****** I have referred a lot of my friends and it is the similar story with them as well. ** ** *** **** **** ** ***** *** *** **** ********* ** ***** ***** ** ***** he identifies the issues and recommends us to the right specialists. With all these, Doctor Sathya Prakash has not just been a doctor but a good friend who is just like an extended family. BWVishnu ",

Worked wonders and now I am pain free.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlso, in past he has treated my wife for her slip disc problem and my mother for her foot bone problem.

Pain killers can also be subscribed by the Pharmacists. What is the difference between you and the Pharmacists? You are there to listen and look at the patients condition, do an appropriate diagnosis. \n\nPlease understand that over and wrong prescriptions is killing citizens of India and reducing the productivity of India.

I first met doctor for ACL tear, I had to undergo a surgery for this and trust me to this date I have never faced issues post the surgery and I do everything what I used to before the ACL tear. The experience, recommendation, suggestion and guidance provided during the surgery was way more than what I could expect. Doctor was very patient in explaining everything in detail that even to this date if somebody comes to with me an ACL tear I explain it to them what happens, how it goes and how my experience was.. So it's now 11 years post the surgery and everything is normal as before. After this I have consulted him numerous times, one of the experience I would like to share is with regards to the disc bulge issue, to keep it short, he is far better than any other doctor's because his treatment really helped me and after that I have never had issues which is really rare compared to the other people who I have known had had similar issues. . ****** ** **** ************* ** ***** *** **** ***** **** *** ********** ** ********* ***** ***** *** **** ***** ** ******* *** ****** I have referred a lot of my friends and it is the similar story with them as well. ** ** *** **** **** ** ***** *** *** **** ********* ** ***** ***** ** ***** he identifies the issues and recommends us to the right specialists.

He was complaining saying I did not go to the place where he has recommended ( which he dint ). From the moment he saw that the MRI was done from a different place his tone and speech changed and he was least bothered to even look into the scan report.  Finally did i get the solution for my issues- NO-. I would suggest not to visit this place. ",
