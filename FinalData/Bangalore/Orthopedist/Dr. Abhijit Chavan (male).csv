None,None,0,0,YES,"I met with a road accident near ITPL last year where I sustained severe/comminuted fracture of the proximal tibia on my right leg. Dr.Abhijit operated my leg effectively by putting together all the broken pieces and I now have my bone fully formed and set. He made me and my family understand the seriousness and complexity of this fracture prior to the surgery and assured us that he would do his best to put the bones together and also advised on the part I had to play post the surgery in recovering and coming back to normalcy.

The interactions and care provided by Dr.Abhijit right from my emergency admission at NH Whitefield till my discharge and follow up consultations have been amazing. Based on my interactions with him for the past one year within both Inpatient and Outpatient settings, he has been consistently fast, openly communicating and most importantly, reliable and effective. I highly recommend him for any ortho consultations and surgeries within the neighbourhood and in Bangalore.",2016-06-11 06:22:50,False,True,Srinivasan Ramamoorthi,,,
