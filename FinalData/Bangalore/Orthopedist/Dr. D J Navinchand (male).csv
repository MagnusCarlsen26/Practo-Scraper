,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Navinchand is one of the nicest persons as a doctor that I have across in my life. I have seen best doctors as per internet feedback who unfortunately are not nice persons (from my experience) but Dr. Navindchand is happily one of the exceptions. I started video consulation for my mother (who is a patient of osteoarthritis) during Covid times in Decemeber 2021. Video consultations never felt like video consultation but more like physical consultation.  Right from day one of doctor's consultation, I found him very approachable. His medication and prescribed physiotherapy worked very well for my mother till the time Total Knee Replacement could be operated.
In our case, I was abroad and we had to schedule the surgery for my mother in a planned manner. Dr. Navinchand had been very cooperative in this matter. The surgery was planned so well a few months before. We just visited Manipal Hospital Hebbal once for the hospitalization formalities and then the surgery was done in the next few days. Another important point that I would like to mention is doctor was very supportive in completing our insurance formalities. He provided all necessary clinical evidences to expedite the cashless insurance process. That was really a great support. He had always been responsive over phone and messages for any clarifications or questions which really gave us a lot of mental peace and comfort. 
Finally my mother was operated on her right knee and she got discharged in just 2 days. Dr. Navinchard along with Dr. Akshay from his team were always a support during the post surgery and pain management time. My mother has been recovering well and now physiotherapy which is also very crucial post this surgery is being  continued. Overall, it was such a nice experience, I would say. We would never welcome an ailment in our life being human being. But when an ailment happens, it is our experience with the doctor that makes the journey cherishable. I would definitely recommend Dr. Navinchand to others.
Thank you Dr. Navinchand once again.",2023-01-06 10:02:42,False,True,Kallal Nath,"Thank you for taking the time to write this review.

,,0,0,YES,"Happy to share my second experience with Dr. Navinchand and Manipal Hospital Hebbal. Followed by my mother in law's Total Knee Replacement surgery last year on her left knee,she underwent Total Knee Replacement surgery on her right knee this year in the month of August 2023. This time also it was an equally nice experience. Thanks to Dr. Navinchand for his great support right from planning the admission, till surgery and discharge of my mother in law. This is very important particularly for patients and their family members who have to travel from outside Bangalore and country to get the surgery done. Cashless approval from insurance, pre-surgery check-ups and tests, surgery, post surgery supervision and finally discharge followed by dressing change and stitch removal everything went very smoothly. This time my mother recovered even faster than last time, from post surgery pain and immobility. Thanks to doctor Navinchand once again. I definitely recommend Dr. Navinchand to others not only for a fine treatment and surgery but also to have a nice overall personal experience.",2023-12-27 09:45:54,False,True,Rita Choudhury,,,
,,0,0,YES,What struck us about Dr. Navinchand is his friendly nature and patience while answering questions about the surgery. I underwent Total Knee Replacement and I was pleasantly surprised when he shared his phone no. for questions/clarifications during the recovery period post-TKR. This was so useful because I had so many doubts on the physiotherapy and pain management during the recovery period. The doctor would respond to all whatsApp messages and also respond to phone calls. This is a very rare quality among doctors. I would recommend him to the others. I am much better now.,2022-02-15 09:40:38,False,True,Mohan Komarlingam S,"Thank you for taking the time to write this review.

,,0,0,YES,The doctor is good as mentioned in consulting. but charges are High when compared to online. where in walkin to hospital they are charging 750+60 = 810 rs per visit at Columbia Asia hospital. Even if we visit next day they charge 250 rs per consultation.this is not recommendable by patients and others too. ,2021-09-10 03:14:02,False,True,Verified Patient,"Thank you for taking the time to write this review.
