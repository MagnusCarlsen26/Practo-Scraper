"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Knee replacement,",0,0,NO,"If u see I don’t normally write feedback unless I am disappointed. Because good reviews can be bought and written by relatives but bad reviews r mostly genuine. 
Anyways so I took my mom today to see this doc. She has severe knee pain. So once he checked her knee and X ray he suggested that we could do 2 things. Surgery or Medication. So he said first go watch the AV. We did. Once we went bk to him he said ok so let me knw once u r ready. We said we did not want surgery yet but we wanted suppliments for time being till we make a decision. He said no supplements can help. I told him he said so and to give pain killer. To that he said go to a Family doctor. Seriously only if doctors knew how it feels to be on the other side patients would recover  half there itself by just doctor’s consoling them. Anyways. The hospital “Apolo specially “ in Jayanagar was also very disappointing. No co Ordination. Not recommending at all",2018-07-03 10:09:53,False,False,simran mish,,,
