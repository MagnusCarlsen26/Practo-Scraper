My Mother underwent Total Knee Replacement (TKR) of both knees in 06/March/2024 at Nano Hospitals. Dr.Mohan M R was the surgeon who did the procedure for my Mother.

Firstly, the TKR surgery itself is life changing. My mother is recovering well day by day by following the procedueres which doctor suggested.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Mohan M R sir for anyone considering bilateral Knee replacement surgery. His proficiency, dedication to patient well-being, and exemplary post-operative care make him an outstanding choice for individuals seeking a skilled and compassionate orthopedic surgeon. My gratitude to Dr.Mohan M R sir and his team for transforming what could have been a daunting experience into a remarkably positive and successful journey to improved mobility and quality of life.
