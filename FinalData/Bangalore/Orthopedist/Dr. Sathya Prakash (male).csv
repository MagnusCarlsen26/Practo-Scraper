"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"I have a very long relationship with D.Sathya Prakash. I have known, been consulting him for last 11 years for various health issues/injuries. I first met doctor for ACL tear, I had to undergo a surgery for this and trust me to this date I have never faced issues post the surgery and I do everything what I used to before the ACL tear. The experience, recommendation, suggestion and guidance provided during the surgery was way more than what I could expect. Doctor was very patient in explaining everything in detail that even to this date if somebody comes to with me an ACL tear I explain it to them what happens, how it goes and how my experience was.. So it's now 11 years post the surgery and everything is normal as before. After this I have consulted him numerous times, one of the experience I would like to share is with regards to the disc bulge issue, to keep it short, he is far better than any other doctor's because his treatment really helped me and after that I have never had issues which is really rare compared to the other people who I have known had had similar issues. . ****** ** **** ************* ** ***** *** **** ***** **** *** ********** ** ********* ***** ***** *** **** ***** ** ******* *** ****** I have referred a lot of my friends and it is the similar story with them as well. ** ** *** **** **** ** ***** *** *** **** ********* ** ***** ***** ** ***** he identifies the issues and recommends us to the right specialists.
