Standing for longer than 20 minutes and activities like climbing stairs and squatting were extremely painful. After conducting a thorough examination he diagnosed her with early-stage knee osteoarthritis and recommended three weeks of physiotherapy along with muscle strengthening exercises, which significantly alleviated her pain. We liked that Dr. Karan closely monitored her progress periodically and provided constant motivation to adhere to the exercise regimen. He emphasizes the importance of exercise and a healthy lifestyle for long-term benefits instead of just prescibing medicines. His proficiency in local languages (Kannada)  did help in making the patient comfortable and no matter how many questions we really appreciate his patience and care.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"If there is someone who is royally breaking up the negative stereotyping some doctors have managed to make in the minds of the patients, its him.

Visited for my mom's lower limb pain and she underwent a successful hassle-free knee replacement by him. 

I have to say this, he is one of the most polite, professional and clinically sound surgeons we have come across. His approach is clearly indicative of 'first do no harm'. Add to it, he is communicative, and has a re-assuring aura about him. Doctor is well learned and  very bright in my opinion. Mother's recovery was also smooth and painfree and results were good. He explains everything at every stage: consultation, pre and post surgery, and keeps your expectations practical and real by making you aware of every issue and prospective solution, and the extent achievable. 

In short , he is honest and makes no false promises. Guess, that what he means by patient centric approach.
I have  to sincerely thank him and his entire team for everything, and recommend him strongly.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"Today evening I visited Dr Karan Kukreja at Manipal for pain in my right feet . I also have heel spur .He examined my foot and explained to me in detail about the issue.  He also showed me some exercises which I am supposed to do . Unlike other doctors who only show interest in patient if the issue is complex or they can do an upcoming surgery on him/her , Dr Karan is very different. He treats everything with equal seriousness. I have seen doctors tend to neglect minor issues and feel interested only when they see a chance to do surgery . For a patient every issue even a small one is important as it is about his/her health.  Dr  Karan is definitely that doctor who will hear to your small queries and small issues and address them completely.  He gives full information and doesn't rush.
