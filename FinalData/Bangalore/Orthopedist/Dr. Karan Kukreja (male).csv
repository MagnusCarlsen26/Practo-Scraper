"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"2 years back my father-in-law faced a severe accident. His both legs fractured. Left leg tibia bone and right leg femur bone. He got treated in Sparsh hospital by another doctor. There he got closed reduction internal fixation done in both the bones. Started recovering and was able to walk after 3 months. 

Soon after 1 year he started pain in left leg tibia bone. When we went through X-ray the screw has been broken inside also the tibia bone didn‚Äôt get joined properly. 

Then we got to know about Dr. Karan from one of our relative, who has been treated for ankle fracture from him. He was very much satisfied with his treatment. He is one of the best orthopedic doctor. 

We consulted Dr. Karan. He went through the x-ray and examined my father-in-law. He clearly explained what the problem is and what kind of treatment has to be done. He went through medical records of earlier surgery. He gave enough time to clarify all our queries. He suggested for exchange nailing treatment to replace the existing rod. Within two days he operated. The operation was really successful. He properly guided us how to put slowly weight on that leg and how much rest is required. Finally my father-in-law is able to walk freely. In the recent x-ray it clearly showed good progress of bone formation in the joint. 

Entire treatment process was very smooth. Dr. Karan is very much approachable to clarify all queries. Post operation also we visited couple of times to his clinic ‚ÄòLife Orthocare‚Äô for dressing and consultation. I definitely recommend Dr. Karan for any kind of orthopedic treatment.

At the outset,we regret you could not meet the doctor.We understand your disappointment that comes along with it as well.
Now,here is what happened-
you booked an appointment through practo for october 2,2018,to meet Dr.Karan at Life plus hospitals and it was confirmed.You and everyone else had a national holiday we understand.But doctor didnt have a leave.That evening he had to go in for an emergency surgery,and had asked the staff to cancel all ""elective""OPD appointments.Needless to mention,that an emergency is always a priority.
anyhow,so our staff did call up all the patients who had confirmed OPD appointments well in advance.Unfortunately,only you didn't pick up the call.Nor did you call back.Our staff tried again,your phone was out of reach.In middle of other actvities at the hospital,our staff lost track here..and you ended up coming to the hospital,and couldn't meet the doctor.
Now,as we see it,its noones fault.Doctors keep getting pulled in emergency surgeries and phones keep getting missed...As much as we understand your disappoinment,we dont think,that not being able to meet your doctor on your leave day entitles you to call him inefficient at--explaination of the health issue,treatement satisfaction,value for money,wait time,bad service etc etc(all things selected by you).IF YOU DID NOT MEET THE DOCTOR--HOW CAN YOU RATE ALL THIS?:)
our staff called you again the next day to apologise and reschedule and you actually shouted on them again.Not very amicable.
We value our patients and take atmost care to ensure their wellbeing while trying our best to match up time constraints and other concerns.In a day to day life,these kind of things are bound to happen,its only an operational issue that could have been avaoided,had the call connected
Anyway,we wish your health concern has been addressed.If not,you are always welcome to see the doctor on prior appoinment again.
wishing you a healthy life.",2018-10-12T08:53:55+0000,Dr. Karan Kukreja
