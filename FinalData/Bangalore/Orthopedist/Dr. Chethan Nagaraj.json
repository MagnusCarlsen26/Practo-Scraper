I went to many Doctors but it was not helping then my family doctor suggested me about Dr Chetan in Vikram Hospital. We went to Vikram hospital Chetan sir saw my MRI report and told I am having 2 problem 1st is my muscles is tear and 2nd is shoulder is frozen, so he told 1st he will try with medicine and Physiotherapy  but it did not work then he suggested injection  for frozen shoulder but it also did not help. Then he suggested for surgery. 1st we thought its so big hospital it will be very costly but Chetan sir explain us each and every thing and given us package. We thought they will charge extra amount from given package but at a time of bill I was surprise actually they have collected 30k lesser amount. After surgery now its 11th day my pain has gown almost 90% now I am not taking painkiller tablet. Thanks to Chetan sir and all the staff in Vikram hospital. They were very helpful.\nDr Chetan is a very good person. He is very talented  and knowledgeable person. ",

The pain was so much that I was not able to sleep, unable to move my hand even high power painkiller was not helping. I went to many Doctors but it was not helping then my family doctor suggested me about Dr Chetan in Vikram Hospital. We went to Vikram hospital Chetan sir saw my MRI report and told I am having 2 problem 1st is my muscles is tear and 2nd is shoulder is frozen, so he told 1st he will try with medicine and Physiotherapy  but it did not work then he suggested injection  for frozen shoulder but it also did not help. Then he suggested for surgery. 1st we thought its so big hospital it will be very costly but Chetan sir explain us each and every thing and given us package. We thought they will charge extra amount from given package but at a time of bill I was surprise actually they have collected 30k lesser amount. After surgery now its 11th day my pain has gown almost 90% now I am not taking painkiller tablet. Thanks to Chetan sir and all the staff in Vikram hospital. They were very helpful.\nDr Chetan is a very good person. He is very talented  and knowledgeable person. ",
