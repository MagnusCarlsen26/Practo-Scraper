Dr. Fahim is always available to clear all our doubts and even support us with all means.\nI had a compressed fracture in Tibia and had to undergo surgery with plates. I was very scared, and he took out time for me to boost my n my family's confidence. He also never gives any extra medicine or surgery suggestions if not very needed. He made sure I get help in terms of ambulance or physiotherapy post surgery. I would also appreciate his reffered physio, Dr. Mahesh - He has made me walk freely n swiftly on stairs without pushing hard within a few days with his perfect exercises. I had 3 physio experiences, and Mahesh is the best one!\nI have a few senior orthopedics in my family back home, and they were parallely in connect on my case and they all were fully convinced with Dr. Fahim's treatment and were very happy. They commended his work a lot. \nWe believe in Dr. Fahim and would recommend everyone to visit him if they want a doctor who is ************* *** very kind to patients in every way. \nThank you so much \ud83d\ude4f",

The entire process right from visiting him first time, prep for the surgery, getting the knee replacement done, hospital admission, discharge, and post-operative care for 1 month -- all the phases have been so smooth and nice that I don't have many words to describe it. Dr Fahim is very friendly, advised the best treatment and way forward according to my mom's health condition, and most importantly gave her the confidence that the surgery could be done. My mom has been super happy after getting the surgery done by the doctor just because he has been so supportive and caring about us.  He brings smile to the face of the patients and I think that matters the most during the sickness time. \nI would recommend Dr for anybody and you will find the same what I wrote about it. \n\n\u201cI can't thank you enough for the special, excellent care you have provided and the unique gift of a new knee you gave to my mother.\u201d Thank you sir.

Dr. Fahim is always available to clear all our doubts and even support us with all means.\nI had a compressed fracture in Tibia and had to undergo surgery with plates. I was very scared, and he took out time for me to boost my n my family's confidence. He also never gives any extra medicine or surgery suggestions if not very needed. He made sure I get help in terms of ambulance or physiotherapy post surgery. I would also appreciate his reffered physio, Dr. Mahesh - He has made me walk freely n swiftly on stairs without pushing hard within a few days with his perfect exercises. I had 3 physio experiences, and Mahesh is the best one!\nI have a few senior orthopedics in my family back home, and they were parallely in connect on my case and they all were fully convinced with Dr. Fahim's treatment and were very happy. They commended his work a lot. \nWe believe in Dr. Fahim and would recommend everyone to visit him if they want a doctor who is ************* *** very kind to patients in every way. \nThank you so much \ud83d\ude4f",

Dr Fahim is very friendly, advised the best treatment and way forward according to my mom's health condition, and most importantly gave her the confidence that the surgery could be done. My mom has been super happy after getting the surgery done by the doctor just because he has been so supportive and caring about us.  He brings smile to the face of the patients and I think that matters the most during the sickness time. \nI would recommend Dr for anybody and you will find the same what I wrote about it. \n\n\u201cI can't thank you enough for the special, excellent care you have provided and the unique gift of a new knee you gave to my mother.\u201d Thank you sir.

His treatment approach makes the patient calm and confidant about the recovery process. During the recent visit, Dr Fahim remembered about my NSAID drug related allergy problems too. That's the connectivity he has with his patients. Thanks doctor Fahim, for all the timely help and services. I would certainly recommend Dr Fahim, for any minor~major orthopaedic related issues/concerns. ",

After the diagnosis he suggested me medication and very simple treatment plan.  I am feeling a lot better now.. within 4 weeks..Thanks to sir. It was a great experience! I will highly recommend Dr Fahim for any orthopedic issues!",
