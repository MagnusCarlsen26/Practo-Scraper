"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Foot Pressure/Vascular Assessment,Orthopedic Surgery,",0,0,NO,"I was at Manipal whitefield 2months back for my mother's femur fracture surgery, even that time the service was bad and now it's just terrible. *** ******* ******** ** ********* * ***** ******** *** ** ***** *** *** *** ******* *** ******** ********* ***** *** * **** *********** *********. She had to be in the ICU for a day, and I had to spend money, time and energy for negligence on a doctor's end. We have gone for multiple appointments in these 2 months but not once was that medicine was told to be continued. 

Manipal only cares about protocol, when it's convenient to them. The ER staffs ***** *** ******* ** ******* didn't care to remember her name) were too arrogant when asked about the condition of my mother. The nurses and housekeeping staffs were pulling away my mother's leg in ways that would even hurt people with unbroken bones. No information was being passed from the ER staffs to the radiologists etc and they were asking us what test they were supposed to do. And all this, for a mistake that your hospital and doctors did. 

She had to stay at the ICU for a day and was told would be shifted to a normal ward soon but waited till evening for a bed to be available, only to find out that the bed was not even made, no housekeeping done, no essential kits given for the attender, unclean toilets. The guards on the floor kept bothering attenders to leave, since only one attender can stay, when we were just going to collect our belongings from the room. The nurse station was empty at times and they were always overworked. We had to wait more than an hour for a simple IV change or meds or bandage dressings. We got the essentials next day, after asking them for a whole day. Our food preferences were asked on the next day, but even then food provided was not what we chose. Wrong lunch was given at 1:43pm and then when informed, it was changed after an hour. Same happened in the evening, then what's the point of even asking what food preference we have. 

Nurses came in the morning and told to skip the BP medicine, since the BP is stable and then comes later on saying we shouldn't have skipped it and then gave the medicine. 

The lifts were filthy, smelling of garbage. Discharge always takes so long, even after getting all required approvals from insurer and settling all final payments. Partial refunds given and no mention of the amount pending to be refunded which I can apparently use to buy meds at the pharmacy. Even calling an ambulance has a wait time of upwards of an hour. Can go on and on of what was wrong with this hospital, *** *** **** ********* ***** *** *** ********** **** *** ******** ***** *** ** ** *** ******** ** *** ******** ****** ",2023-05-12 17:17:01,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
