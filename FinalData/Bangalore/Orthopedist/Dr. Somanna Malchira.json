                "review_text": "On a beautiful Saturday morning I was cleaning my motorcycle,while it was running.Yeah I know ! A moment of lapse in attention, the motorcycle chain dragged my right hand thumb into the rear chain sprocket . Crrrruchhh !! Thumb crushed and cut almost in halve, blood flooded the garage, lift and corridor of my apartment.  My wife rushed me to the Emergency of HSR Narayana multi speciality hospital. This is where I meet Dr Somanna for the first time. He assessed the situation with utmost professionalism and  composure.Got an X-ray done immediately.I needed surgery, so he explained everything in detail about the nature of the injury. Made me understand all the possibilities of the surgery and set the right expectation for the recovery and rehabilitation time-line.He was concerned with infection in the wound as it was a very very dirty wound with dust, grease and what not in it. In OT, he first took the utmost care to clean the wound to the maximum extent possible.When he showed me a pic of my wounded finger after cleaning, it had no dirt in it !! I wish I could share the before and after pictures here. Unbelievable !! Through out the surgery he kept talking to me about my hobbies, what all I do, and even shared his interest. The whole experience was so relaxing !! Post surgery, after getting discharged from hospital I had to see him frequently for wound dressing, checking on how it was healing, rehab-exercises etc. He never charged me one dime for any of these visits. It was only after I insisted to pay his fees did he accept it for my last two visits. It has been more than a year now since that faithful day. My finger is in such a good shape today that people can't even tell that I have had a surgery.That in itself stands testament Dr Somanna's prowess.I have had 4 surgeries on me at various stages of my life, due to injuries. My experience with Dr Somanna had been the best. In fact, I need to undergo an ACL reconstruction repeat surgery because the initial surgery which I had 13 yrs back has failed. No points for guessing  who my surgeon is going to be ! The best part with Dr Somanna is the way he connects with and takes care of his patients. How he patiently listens to his patients, and answers all of there questions. You never feel like another random person in a herd of patients. Thank you Dr. Keep up the extraordinary work ! God bless !",

Ofcourse it was scary and initially I was really concerned how fast and how well it will be healed. \nThank you doctor. Your experience, excellence and confidence, played a big role in boosting up my confidence and became my strength everyday. \n\nI would like to mention as well the followup checkup in 6 months I had here in Germany. You know, it is always pleasant to have a positive feedback from another expert. Yes that's what happe happened. The doctor here was so happy with surgery, he repeatedly told just WOW and finally asked the doctor and hospital name and concluded with a statement \"wow India has great doctors!\". Feel proud of India and again thank you Dr. Sumanna. God bless you.",

A moment of lapse in attention, the motorcycle chain dragged my right hand thumb into the rear chain sprocket . Crrrruchhh !! Thumb crushed and cut almost in halve, blood flooded the garage, lift and corridor of my apartment.  My wife rushed me to the Emergency of HSR Narayana multi speciality hospital. This is where I meet Dr Somanna for the first time. He assessed the situation with utmost professionalism and  composure.Got an X-ray done immediately.I needed surgery, so he explained everything in detail about the nature of the injury. Made me understand all the possibilities of the surgery and set the right expectation for the recovery and rehabilitation time-line.He was concerned with infection in the wound as it was a very very dirty wound with dust, grease and what not in it. In OT, he first took the utmost care to clean the wound to the maximum extent possible.When he showed me a pic of my wounded finger after cleaning, it had no dirt in it !! I wish I could share the before and after pictures here. Unbelievable !! Through out the surgery he kept talking to me about my hobbies, what all I do, and even shared his interest. The whole experience was so relaxing !! Post surgery, after getting discharged from hospital I had to see him frequently for wound dressing, checking on how it was healing, rehab-exercises etc. He never charged me one dime for any of these visits. It was only after I insisted to pay his fees did he accept it for my last two visits. It has been more than a year now since that faithful day. My finger is in such a good shape today that people can't even tell that I have had a surgery.That in itself stands testament Dr Somanna's prowess.I have had 4 surgeries on me at various stages of my life, due to injuries. My experience with Dr Somanna had been the best. In fact, I need to undergo an ACL reconstruction repeat surgery because the initial surgery which I had 13 yrs back has failed. No points for guessing  who my surgeon is going to be ! The best part with Dr Somanna is the way he connects with and takes care of his patients. How he patiently listens to his patients, and answers all of there questions. You never feel like another random person in a herd of patients. Thank you Dr. Keep up the extraordinary work ! God bless !",

Ofcourse it was scary and initially I was really concerned how fast and how well it will be healed. \nThank you doctor. Your experience, excellence and confidence, played a big role in boosting up my confidence and became my strength everyday. \n\nI would like to mention as well the followup checkup in 6 months I had here in Germany. You know, it is always pleasant to have a positive feedback from another expert. Yes that's what happe happened. The doctor here was so happy with surgery, he repeatedly told just WOW and finally asked the doctor and hospital name and concluded with a statement \"wow India has great doctors!\". Feel proud of India and again thank you Dr. Sumanna. God bless you.",
