,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Raghavendra Reddy is a great doctor. He takes time with patient to help them with their health issues and very humble to speak. I have observed the same during my every visit.  It is rare to find Doctor that combine such personal touches and care for patient with outstanding quality of medical care. I pray one should not require visiting Dr but if needed, I highly recommend becoming his patient. ",2023-02-16 15:26:52,False,True,Rishab Tiwary,,,
