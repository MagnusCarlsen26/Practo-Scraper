"Treatment satisfaction,","Spinal Therapy,",0,0,YES,"I visited the Doctor yesterday as I was not able to sleep due to backpain.  I went with a MRI report and he asked me some questions and also asked me to walk in three different formats in front of him. After he advised me to get MRI printouts along-with three x-rays. After  examining the Xrays and MRI printout,  he explained the causes for my paid and also advised me to get one blood test to give final opinion/advice. After the blood test he explained the gravity of the problem and prescribed medicines. I recommend the doctor as he spends time on examining the reports X-rays, MRI print outs etc., before giving final opinion and/or prescribing further course of action\. My only request to the Doctor is to give extra one or two minutes time to the patients if they have some doubts to clear. Since he did not explain what medicines I should take and what exercises I can do. To this question he said that everything is explained in the printouts. From the printout , I got 50% of the info / clarifications I wanted. I am visiting the Doctor on 4th of July, I hope he would give one or two minutes extra time to clear my doubts.  As I said the Doctor is very good in his evaluation of patients, only one suggestion to give a minute or two to clear the docuts.

He will explain what’s wrong with you and it’s your own moral responsibility to also research on what is actually wrong with you and then clarify your doubts with him and he’d be more than happy to explain. 

I was suffering for so long that I wasn’t able to sit stand walk or do anything. And one meeting with him made me sure that in my condition conservative therapy isn’t going to help me any further and after a very sensible discussion with him I agreed to get this surgery done by him. 

Nevertheless ... yes I was skeptical too and hestiated too but not about the doctor or the procedure ... it was only because we are humans and all this is darn too much to take at times. 

However I’m very fortunate that I found Dr Pithwa!! And I would recommend him to all those people out there who are suffering from a spinal issue. Meet him once he is absolutely worth a shot and should be your last stop to get all your issues resolved.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My Mother-in-law was suffering with server pain left leg for couple of years and it was increasing over the time and it reached a stage where she was unable to stand/walk for more than 10min. we consulted couple of Ortho/Spine specialists and we were suggested to go for spine surgery to remove the disk compression and herniation to get rid of pain. After spending lots of time, We finally decided to go with Yogesh sir based on his credentials and experience. Based on the MRI and other reports, he suggested a 3level surgery (L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1) and  mentioned its going to be super-Major surgery. He explained clearly about severity of the case, risk involved in the surgery along with proposed surgical procedure. It is really appreciable the way he made us comfortable and built the confidence in my mother-in-law. Finally surgery was performed in the month of Aug 2022. The surgery went for more than 8hours and it was told all went well. It was informed that the disk compressions were removed at all 3levels and implanted Artificial cages at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.

my Mother-in-law started walking slowly on day-3 with the help of physiotherapist and we were discharged from hospital on day-6. She started recovering slowly - of course she had bit of tough time in the recovery process. But, the kind of support from Yogesh sir post surgery really helped her uplifting her confidence level and made her walk for more than 30min in a single stretch within 3weeks of time.  Its now 6months and she is completely free of pain and could lead her normal life without any sort of pain.

We would like to convey our sincere gratitude to Yogesh sir for giving her life back.

I strongly recommend Yogesh  sir for his finest skill-set, experience, post surgery care and the patient interaction.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spine Injury,",0,0,NO,"I recently visited the clinic for my Spine injury, happened a month ago and the initial medication for a month was elsewhere nearby. Since it was to do with Spine injury,  wanted to consult another specialist and based one of relatives recommendation we consulted the doctor.I visited the clinic with all my reports X-RAY, MRI Scans & other medications I was undergoing. I was asked to pay for the consultation the moment we entered, which is still acceptable.After a long wait, it was my turn. Me and my wife entered, and the Doctor later came in. For initial few seconds the doctor didn't even bother to ask anything and kept looking at some form. After that hold, he asked for X-ray. I told him I have my MRI scans and reports too, which I thought would have given much clarity, but he didn't respond to it and continued to look at X-rays for just few secs and kept aside.I was just waiting for the doctor to probe and ask for details on how, when & what happened, but he didn't. I waited but then couldn't resist, and I started off on explaining what exactly and what are the medications I'm undergoing. I continuously spoke for few minutes, but he looked as if he wasn't interested at all, nor was making an eye contact towards us and was busy looking elsewhere. I felt very disappointed with his attitude and not caring kind of behaviour. He didn't look approachable at all.I was going through a Spinal fracture and was expecting the doctor to atleast guide me / suggest me on continuing or changes in current medication I was undergoing. Since it was NOT an free consultation and I had paid a bomb amount, even before seeing the doctor. I didn't give up. I wanted my questions to be clarified & addressed. When asked for questions, he didn't respond to some and then very rudely he asked me to STOP and to Listen to Him. I felt really offended with that behaviour. I had travelled from such long distance, hoping to know on my condition and the next steps that Doctor can guide.I was expecting the doctor to explain me on the depth of the problem, improvement and the medication to be followed (if there were changes in current).I guess we had spent 5mins  or so by now, and then he got a call from someone, and he responded, give me 2 Mins and kept the call. I was totally worried, if the doctor would close in 2mins, since for last few minutes spent there was nothing I was guided through or was even explained on next steps or even probed on what happened or even the doctor looked at all the medications I was going through & said ok. After the call, he showed sense of urgency and wanted to close as soon as possible. I still didn't give up and aksed what next? And then he wrote a lot of blood  related tests,  which might help him examine better in the next visit, in a weeks time, he said. I got more worried because, one - I spent so much on the X-ray, MRI'S and other tests already, which were not even looked with quality time (atleast a minute) or even probed about, and second - on what basis were the tests suggested. I still was ok and accepted.Since there was a gap of a week, until my next suggested meet the doctor again, with the reports for the new tests recommended for analysis.  I very badly wanted to know what should I for a week? Continue with the current medication or stop it? I remember I asked him 3 times. And then rudely he responded,  ""Let's not go in circles"".

Since it was Spine, it didn't want to neglect or regret later ******* ** ***** ***********While showing sense of urgency to close and not caring kind of attitude, unfortunately, he then got a call again, and he said ""2 mins"" and disconnected. I was scared, if he would say we are done and you may leave. And He did. I had reached the saturation point by now. I couldn't resist and told him that there is a reason why I have come all the way from so far, and there is a reason why I'm asking so many questions & still getting ignored. I repeated, I have spent a huge amount on travel and consultation, and not just to come & sit for less than 10mins & be ignored, insulted. He laughed and after that I didn't want to sit any longer. He finally took a form and ticked few tablets that I can take and asked to leave.I didn't want to talk about the experience & doctor 's behaviour with wife, since it was a close relative from her side who recommended him.

And that's when I felt, it wasn't just me who felt it wasn't a worth of visit.I have never had such experience in past nor seen a professional behave so unprofessional. Right from beginning till end, he was not friendly at all, and was very arrogant. Didn't want the patient to ask questions at all. And never wanted to clarify things in detail. Then whom do we go to? How do we read those reports? I'm not here to criticize or write negative. It's just an experience that disturbed me coming all the way & spending so much, for nothing.

Thank!",2019-09-30 20:13:05,False,False,Ritesh Jain,"There's always a lot to learn from criticism. Thanks for your feedback. Helps me improve! 

However, I thought I will also clarify the some of the points that you have raised.

Every investigation has its on importance. Just because MRI is a more costly test, it does not mean that going through X-rays is not important! There is a sequence in which a spine fracture is evaluated; first investigation is the X-ray followed by a CT scan and lastly an MRI. You may get this verified with any good spine surgeon!

You also expressed some displeasure over the time that I took to evaluate your x rays and MRI! If I can manage to get all the information that I need by taking a look at the investigations within 1-2 minutes, then I am afraid I don't see any logic to continuously stare at the investigations for any longer period!

I acknowledge your point about importance of eye contact with the patient. However, I sometimes want to keenly focus on what the patient is talking and hence I may look elsewhere to just pay all attention to the patient's words!

You mentioned something about me receiving phone calls. However, I will highlight a point which you probably failed to notice! I leave my phone outside the consultation room with my staff so that I can give undivided attention to my patients. I receive the phone call only if there is some emergency related to some other patient in the hospital. And that is exactly what happened on that day!

As regards further investigations in your case, I think I made it very clear that you being a 31-year old, it is extremely unusual to have a fracture in the spine with a trivial fall. Also, it is very unusual to have continued pain in the spine after a relatively minor fracture in the spine at the end of 1 month from the day of injury. You also reported some history of fever in the recent past. All these factors necessitated further investigations. As a norm, we do not encourage further discussions till the investigations are done. This is because theoretical discussions about possibilities of there being some kind of infection or tumor or osteoporosis or some other severe condition; in the absence of proper investigation can lead to undue stress in the patient! Hence I requested you that we should not discuss further on this topic till we see the investigations.

Ultimately a doctor-patient relationship is based on trust. If you do not trust the doctor, then everything that he says or recommends will be viewed with suspicion. We may not be able to give you all the answers to all your questions in a single visit. 

Also we do not use any kind of timer when we are consulting! Some patients may require 5 minutes consultation; some may require 15 minutes; some may require 30 minutes; we do not vary our consultation charges based on the time spent with patient!

While I respect your viewpoint, I thought I would add my viewpoint for a fair understanding!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Spine pain,",0,0,NO,"Let me start with my 1st meeting with him, I met him in hosmat hospital for my wife spine and neck pain, he checked for 40 seconds and then he took out printed prescription and ticket some medicines and said do mri scans and indirectly told us to leave, we asked him questions but he was not interested in answering, we thought may be scans he wants, so we got scans done and went to him again in his personal clinic, he did not even looked at scans and x-rays for even 2 minutes, anyways when we asked him what is the issue, he said a nerve is little bent but we could see in reports it was clearly mentioned about swollen nerves oneot of things which he did not mention. That's fine. we asked him again if it's curable and serious he laughed and paused and said you just take medicines,that face he made was very insulting , we don't know how to read mri scans properly that's why probably we visited him to know what is wrong but he does not have time to explain the problem in detail but rather he will with his arrogance will spoil your mood and day, moreover after that he then got up from his seat and opened the door which is a gesture that get out and leave. He did not even took 2-3 minutes to meet us I am wondering how can someone behave like that, he talks very soft but he his behavior is bad. We surely can say he is the most arrogant person we ever met.  We will never visit him again and we cannot recommend him. We would rather suggest him to be patient and try to explain issues clearly and not insult patients.",2018-05-19 11:40:46,False,False,Nikhil Vaid,"I do smile at times to reassure my patient that everything is ok! It's unfortunate that you found that arrogant/ insulting! Evaluating MRI is my daily job since years; so I am a bit surprised as to why you should feel offended by my having taken only a few minutes to evaluate ur MRI! My job is to evaluate the MRI & tell u the gist in simple, non-medical language! If u wish that I explain every medical jargon in the entire MRI report, then I am afraid that is not practically viable! As a doctor, I reassured u that there is a small slipped disk in the neck that is clinically insignificant & it does not require any surgery!! Though I would love to spend time counselling patients, I have also to attend to the next patient after having spent a reasonable time to reassure a patient who has no significant problem!!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Orthopedic Consultation,",0,0,NO,"My appointment was scheduled at 5:25 PM but the doctor didn't show up until 5:30 PM and after he enters into his office he starts his consultation only after his daily evening 'puja' is performed. Once the rituals are done, people who had secured an appointment before 5:25 PM goes in to meet the doctor one by one. By the time you get to see the doctor, the time is 6 PM. What's the point in booking the appointment? Now to talk about the doctor's friendliness, when you ask him questions, he will first ask you to stop and listen to him first -- I felt really Rude when he said: ""Listen first"". One should understand that a patient is already anxious and would like to know his condition which is why he comes to see a doctor. Having that said, the doctor's voice is not audible at all, you won't get to hear him audibly. If you ask additional questions -- rest assured, you will get a reply for 1 or 2 questions maximum. When I visited him for the first time, he was busy working with the printer technician putting all his patients to wait, looks like his printer had some problem. In the follow-up visit, I asked a question but he kept cleaning his spectacle lenses. I felt like I paid the fee just to see him wipe his lenses, Really!? -- To sum up, I was not happy with the entire experience meeting this doctor. He could be famous but how each patient is dealt with is what makes a positive impact. I would NOT return to his office again. A patient expects his doctor to be friendly, who is able to listen to all the complaints patiently against someone who is just famous in his field of study. Thanks",2019-09-18 14:54:48,False,False,Verified Patient,"It is unfortunate that we could not live up to your expectations.
The printer person was asked to come since 4-5 days during non-office hours. He however, did not turn up. Ultimately, when he did turn up, we had to allow him to get the necessary work done. You may probably have undergone a similar experience too, when you are at the mercy of some such person. Anyways, I tried my level best to minimize the inconvenience to my patients in whatever way I could in the given circumstances.
As regards the consultation, while we respect every point raised by the patient, being a non- medical person, the conversation drifts into areas which are not helpful for the doctor to analyze the patient's problem. In such a case, we are forced to redirect the conversation. If you feel that is rude, then sincere apologies!
As regards cleaning specs, I hope you would understand that I did it in front of you not because I wished to! But because, I didn't want to do it in privacy & keep my patients waiting outside & waste their time. I believed I could utilize that time too, to keep seeing my patients. As regards answering your queries, I am reasonably sure that I have counselled you extensively regarding all the findings vof your Mother's MRI + the mismatch between her clinical findings & her MRI findings + the way decisions are made in such scenario. 
Anyways, it is always easy to criticize!

Then i went to Sattvik Spine Foundation with reports. Dr. Yogesh Pithwa told me reality about the injury and how it will heal NATURALLY.

If I can manage to get all the information that I need by taking a look at the investigations within 1-2 minutes, then I am afraid I don't see any logic to continuously stare at the investigations for any longer period!

I acknowledge your point about importance of eye contact with the patient. However, I sometimes want to keenly focus on what the patient is talking and hence I may look elsewhere to just pay all attention to the patient's words!

You mentioned something about me receiving phone calls. However, I will highlight a point which you probably failed to notice! I leave my phone outside the consultation room with my staff so that I can give undivided attention to my patients. I receive the phone call only if there is some emergency related to some other patient in the hospital. And that is exactly what happened on that day!

As regards further investigations in your case, I think I made it very clear that you being a 31-year old, it is extremely unusual to have a fracture in the spine with a trivial fall. Also, it is very unusual to have continued pain in the spine after a relatively minor fracture in the spine at the end of 1 month from the day of injury. You also reported some history of fever in the recent past. All these factors necessitated further investigations. As a norm, we do not encourage further discussions till the investigations are done. This is because theoretical discussions about possibilities of there being some kind of infection or tumor or osteoporosis or some other severe condition; in the absence of proper investigation can lead to undue stress in the patient! Hence I requested you that we should not discuss further on this topic till we see the investigations.

Ultimately a doctor-patient relationship is based on trust. If you do not trust the doctor, then everything that he says or recommends will be viewed with suspicion. We may not be able to give you all the answers to all your questions in a single visit. 

Also we do not use any kind of timer when we are consulting! Some patients may require 5 minutes consultation; some may require 15 minutes; some may require 30 minutes; we do not vary our consultation charges based on the time spent with patient!

While I respect your viewpoint, I thought I would add my viewpoint for a fair understanding! 

God bless you!",2019-12-17T06:20:14+0000,Dr. Yogesh Pithwa
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Spine pain,",0,0,NO,"Let me start with my 1st meeting with him, I met him in hosmat hospital for my wife spine and neck pain, he checked for 40 seconds and then he took out printed prescription and ticket some medicines and said do mri scans and indirectly told us to leave, we asked him questions but he was not interested in answering, we thought may be scans he wants, so we got scans done and went to him again in his personal clinic, he did not even looked at scans and x-rays for even 2 minutes, anyways when we asked him what is the issue, he said a nerve is little bent but we could see in reports it was clearly mentioned about swollen nerves oneot of things which he did not mention. That's fine. we asked him again if it's curable and serious he laughed and paused and said you just take medicines,that face he made was very insulting , we don't know how to read mri scans properly that's why probably we visited him to know what is wrong but he does not have time to explain the problem in detail but rather he will with his arrogance will spoil your mood and day, moreover after that he then got up from his seat and opened the door which is a gesture that get out and leave. He did not even took 2-3 minutes to meet us I am wondering how can someone behave like that, he talks very soft but he his behavior is bad. We surely can say he is the most arrogant person we ever met.  We will never visit him again and we cannot recommend him. We would rather suggest him to be patient and try to explain issues clearly and not insult patients.",2018-05-19 11:40:46,False,False,Nikhil Vaid,"I do smile at times to reassure my patient that everything is ok! It's unfortunate that you found that arrogant/ insulting! Evaluating MRI is my daily job since years; so I am a bit surprised as to why you should feel offended by my having taken only a few minutes to evaluate ur MRI! My job is to evaluate the MRI & tell u the gist in simple, non-medical language! If u wish that I explain every medical jargon in the entire MRI report, then I am afraid that is not practically viable! As a doctor, I reassured u that there is a small slipped disk in the neck that is clinically insignificant & it does not require any surgery!! Though I would love to spend time counselling patients, I have also to attend to the next patient after having spent a reasonable time to reassure a patient who has no significant problem!!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Orthopedic Consultation,",0,0,NO,"My appointment was scheduled at 5:25 PM but the doctor didn't show up until 5:30 PM and after he enters into his office he starts his consultation only after his daily evening 'puja' is performed. Once the rituals are done, people who had secured an appointment before 5:25 PM goes in to meet the doctor one by one. By the time you get to see the doctor, the time is 6 PM. What's the point in booking the appointment? Now to talk about the doctor's friendliness, when you ask him questions, he will first ask you to stop and listen to him first -- I felt really Rude when he said: ""Listen first"". One should understand that a patient is already anxious and would like to know his condition which is why he comes to see a doctor. Having that said, the doctor's voice is not audible at all, you won't get to hear him audibly. If you ask additional questions -- rest assured, you will get a reply for 1 or 2 questions maximum. When I visited him for the first time, he was busy working with the printer technician putting all his patients to wait, looks like his printer had some problem. In the follow-up visit, I asked a question but he kept cleaning his spectacle lenses. I felt like I paid the fee just to see him wipe his lenses, Really!? -- To sum up, I was not happy with the entire experience meeting this doctor. He could be famous but how each patient is dealt with is what makes a positive impact. I would NOT return to his office again. A patient expects his doctor to be friendly, who is able to listen to all the complaints patiently against someone who is just famous in his field of study. Thanks",2019-09-18 14:54:48,False,False,Verified Patient,"It is unfortunate that we could not live up to your expectations.
The printer person was asked to come since 4-5 days during non-office hours. He however, did not turn up. Ultimately, when he did turn up, we had to allow him to get the necessary work done. You may probably have undergone a similar experience too, when you are at the mercy of some such person. Anyways, I tried my level best to minimize the inconvenience to my patients in whatever way I could in the given circumstances.
As regards the consultation, while we respect every point raised by the patient, being a non- medical person, the conversation drifts into areas which are not helpful for the doctor to analyze the patient's problem. In such a case, we are forced to redirect the conversation. If you feel that is rude, then sincere apologies!
As regards cleaning specs, I hope you would understand that I did it in front of you not because I wished to! But because, I didn't want to do it in privacy & keep my patients waiting outside & waste their time. I believed I could utilize that time too, to keep seeing my patients. As regards answering your queries, I am reasonably sure that I have counselled you extensively regarding all the findings vof your Mother's MRI + the mismatch between her clinical findings & her MRI findings + the way decisions are made in such scenario. 
Anyways, it is always easy to criticize!
