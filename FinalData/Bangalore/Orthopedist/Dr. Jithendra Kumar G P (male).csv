None,None,0,0,YES,"In early 2012, I broke my ACL while playing football& consulted Dr Jithendra for reconstruction . My knee was highly unstable then, very difficult to walk.

Got my ACL reconstructed by him , followed by 10 days of Physiotherapy & 2 more follow up consultation. Got back to sports in about 8 months and now it is 8 years over, still active with games-surgically fixed knee is stable. 

I highly recommend him for joint related issues. He is transparent on what he can and which is beyond his specialized skill sets.
