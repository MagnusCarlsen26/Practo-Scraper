"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,It was insisted on conducting the tests at a particular diagnostic centre in malleshwaram saying the particualr tests were only available there. The lab was very unprofessional and wouldn't disclose the costs beforehand. Though they assured that they charge CGHS prices they charged me a hefty amount. Also I was prescribed painkillers which I was required to purchase only from the clinic and not from outside. The joint pain I was suffering from returned immediately after I stopped the painkillers. ,2018-04-03 06:54:00,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hi.. this to just clarify ur dissatisfaction at my clinic.
1.Let me be very clear .. we donot recommend you to go to any particular centre for blood investigations.. if asked only we recommend. Only if I prescribe a MRI then I generally refer u to a particular centre where the radiologist is good so that I can discuss certain issues if they exists OR I leave it to my patient to decide where they want to go.

2.The prices in any private Lab can never match CGHS.. since it's not govt aided ,my staff or myself would have never utter the word CGHS since we are not a part of it.

3.We keep certain basic medicines only for the convenience of the patient .As per rules only medicines can be dispensed to a patient.There is never a compulsion that u need to take it from the clinic.. since there are so many ways u can buy medications online offline.. so on Iam surprised U have bought it and complained. 

4.If u are reluctant to get the investigations how can i diagnose ur disease ..and there is no follow up.. pain automatically will recur since what I would have started is only for symptomatic relief.

I want to reemphasise that No patient coming to my clinic will be compelled to do anything against their decision. since it's the patients right to question get their doubts cleared and get their tests done wherever they want.
It is Patients rights.. and we doctors respect it.

"Value for money,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,NO,Charging 300 for strapping a tape on fingers ******* **** ************ ** **** * ***** ******* ** * ******** **** ***** ****** **** *** I got the Xray checked with another doctor ** ***** ****** ** ***** *** *** ******** ******** ** *** ***** *******Such unprecedented and unprofessional behaviour **** * ***** ** ****** *** *** ****** ******** can’t be accepted. My only restriction to not post it on social media is time.,2019-06-25 08:46:15,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hi.. let me address to ur issues one by one.
1.When it comes to a procedure we have some reasons behind it, we can do buddy strapping with roller bandage which will cost rs 50 ,micropore costing rs 100 and adhesive plaster which I use that is expensive so rs300.

2.When u have an injury to ur toes or fingers, its 
   not just your bone which gets involved remember there are a lot of complex ligaments and tendons responsible for your fine movements.. as far as I remember there was swelling and pain hence suggested a xray,otherwise u would have not consulted me if it had not bothered you.

3.Iam sorry to tell u this .. we cannot say a fracture is there if it is not there.. it has to be seen.. for ur kind information Hairline fractures are not visible and we donot bother much about these fractures.
The reason for buddy strapping is not because there is a fracture or not, but there is a soft tissue damage and it will take 3wks for it to heal,immobilization will help heal it.

Sir u can take any number of opinions its ur right.. but I do my best so that we should never miss a diagnosis and regret if u develop a deformity later on weight bearing. 
Let me tell u this that it is a profession of ethics and it will remain so.. and patients like you will either find faults if in case an xray was not taken and the diagnosis missed. That's why doctors tend to over diagnose rather than underdiagnose due to such over/under educated patients like u who know how to put down the profession and pass bad remarks about a doctor who has made a hard way to reach this position.  We r not gods we treat he heals.
