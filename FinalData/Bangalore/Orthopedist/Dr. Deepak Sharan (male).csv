None,"Wrist problems,",0,0,YES,"I went to Dr Deepak with pain in the wrist and arm. He diagnosed it properly in the first visit and recommended physical therapy, which helped me to recover to a large extent. My condition, thoracic outlet syndrome, was not diagnosed by a leading ortho hospital of Bangalore, and as a result it had been aggravating when I visited Dr. Deepak for the first time.",2016-05-23 18:27:04,False,True,Kamalneet Singh,,,

None,"Ankle Pain,Leg Pain,",0,0,NO,"Rude & unprofessional Doctor. Gives an appointment at 5-5:30 pm but doesn't show up regularly till 7-7:30 or sometimes even 8 pm. The queue obviously piles up and the doctor is in hurry to clear as many patients as possible in the least possible time after that. In his haste, doesn't even respond to patient's questions properly * ********** **** ** **** **** ****** ** ***** ***** ***** ********** For my ankle pain, he asked for x-ray, bone density test (3000+) and full blood test (again 3000+) from his own clinic. Physiotherapy again from his own clinic of which I took 14 to 21 sessions without any improvement. Also took vitamin D, calcium etc. for 3 months and other tablets as per his advice without an iota of improvement. Ended up spending more than 10k over his treatment and many long hours of wait. Once on asking about the technique of one of his physiotherapists, was very rudely snubbed saying, ""He is the expert not you, don't question"". Please stay away from him & all Recoup clinics for your own well being.",2017-01-03 12:18:52,False,False,Vishal Sinha,,,
