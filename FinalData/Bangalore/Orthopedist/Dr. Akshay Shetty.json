He methodically examined my injured knee to rule out healthy ligaments & checked the stability. Once he finished his physical examination, he checked the MRI films & reconciled his findings. Dr Akshay is patient when it comes to explaining the diagnosis & the various solutions. I highly recommend him for any sort of orthopedic examination.  ",
