"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Hand Pain Treatment,Neck Pain Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Took my wife for a  neck and shoulder issue as she had sever pain, also some knee issue and wanted to consult a doctor. So booked an appointment for 12 PM consultation through Practo and reached 10 mins early. There was quiet a crowd.  After multiple follow up with the receptionist, and being told to wait 10 mins every time I asked, we decided to leave after 40 mins wait since we noticed people who came after us were being let in. That's when the doctor called us and asked us to wait 2 mins as he would finish up .  Firstly he was annoyed that we had booked an appointment online and said he doesn't take new patients on weekends. But option to book online appointment was available for everyone. Secondly he hurried through without proper check up or listening to the issue and recommended some tablets or pain injection. didn't want to check knee issue as ""we were in a hurry and not ready to wait"". Was rude and asked us to come back Tuesday when he was free.  All in all , 1. the consultation was done in about 5 mins ( Practo slot was 15 mins) .2.  All the issues were not heard to or addressed, were asked to come back after 2 days. 3. With the hurried check up process, came back with more pain after check up than before , with issue not solved or anything suggested to satisfaction and cost Rs600. 4. Was rude and expressed his displeasure for booking an appointment on days he doesn't accept new patient, but the slot was clearly available online and accepted by them at reception through Practo. they could have just disabled the slot or informed at the reception when we visited so we didn't have to either wait or we could actually consult who was ready to help. **** ** *** ***** ******* ****** * **** ******* ** ***** * **** **** *******",2021-11-07 10:13:10,False,False,naveen02p0921@gmail.com,,,

i had Left Hand elbow dislocation while playing kabaddi in the month of Jan2017 , now its May 2017 almost 4 months i had ignored consulting docter after getting an X-RAY done just after my injury which said no fracture as such and i was advised then to give time for healing as lot of Tissue damage had happened. i can barely straighten my Left hand post injury.

Today as i visited Dr Anand clinic , i was very happy to hear that i was very lucky with my injury,nothin major with regards my elbow dislocation .
Way he inspected and educated me regarding my injury was very helpful.

i luved the physio therapy further which was advised by docter. 15mins of Some vibrating  stuff to my hand was so soothing and docter has promised me in nex t10 sittings i could be able to completely get back to normal strong left hand movement only 30% straightening is pending which will be fixed in physio therapy.

Thankyou Dr Anand for motivating me and made me feel better & helped me understand what exactly my hand situation is.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Orthopedic Physiotherapy,",0,0,YES,"Doctor was good and listen to our problem with patience. Liked the way he treats the patient. Will definitely recommend others to visit him.

I have some suggestions. When we visit any clinic, not only the doctors everything should matters. We took appointment at 5.30 but was late for 20mins due to some personal traits. We got a very bad welcome from the front office team. We were visiting their for the first time. I do respect their time and even they should listen to our problem. 
If they cant treat us on the same day. They could have rescheduled it. Scolding us and showing high attitude in a bad way infront of everyone really makes odd for someone who is visiting for the first time. I noticed, it was not for everyone. It was partial. The others who look too smart and official. These ladies were like happily speaking even though they are late. My question is .. Why to make someone too much odd ..?i agree smile is not required. Atleast good hospitality matters alot. If doctor can look into this.

You can sees standardization in every small function in his clinic from the time you enter and until you exit. Standardization is visible even on the switches of his clinic! I bet, the ISO guys might learn a few titbits from this clinic and it's awesome doctor if they get to visit this neat clinic. Dr. Anand is a personification of 'Perfection'. There is methodology built into everything he does. Inviting his patient, understanding the issue, putting the patient in ease by explaining every intricate detail, treating the patient and follow through. A patient wouldn't have any questions to ask at the end of the visit, if one paid complete attention to what the doctor said.The most important and surprising aspect happened after a fortnight from the initial visit. I was called by some woman by name Kiran from the clinic asking how I felt!!!

If the doctor is going to charge extra fee for the extra time given, atleast the patient need to be told in prior. The receptionist lady sounded care free and not much friendly in her tone. 
About the doctor himself, he was very down to earth and a very good listener. He tried to understand my problems and suggest me the needful. He suggested me vitamin D supplement instead of medicines as mutually discussed. 
I don't have any specific complaints about the doctor but about the way situation was handled on my first visit. 
I didn't buy the medicines from them. That could also be the reason they charged 500 consultation fee instead of 400.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr.Anand is the most patient friendly, humble doctor i have ever seen. 
Nowadays, most of the doctors are busy and by the time, we finish speaking  two sentences, they will come to a conclusion and start writing prescription. But Dr.Anand is an exception to it. He listens to all that the patient has to say, examines properly and only then he starts explaining about the problem. 
One day, i noticed at the reception, a man said that he doesn't have enough money for consultation and asked if it is still possible to get a consultation from the doctor. They immediately accepted his request and the doctor attended to him.
Also, in general, Dr.Anand gives so much respect to every patient. He ensures that all his staff also treat the visitors special.

Somedays, the lobby gets really full and my observation is that at the reception, they do not tell the real waiting time for the patient. They assure that they will be seen very shortly and some patients end up waiting for more than an hour even. Some people get annoyed by the false hopes given on the waiting time. This is the only practice to be improved.
