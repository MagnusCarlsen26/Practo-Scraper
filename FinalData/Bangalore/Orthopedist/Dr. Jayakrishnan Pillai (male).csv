Good Things about Doctor:
1. Does his Diagnose well without asking for many tests or Reports.
2. Does not Rx - unwanted or placebo medicines. Just Rx - the medicines to cure the problem. 

Areas of improvement for Doctor:
1. I felt if the doctor maintained the eye contact with Patient would be good and got that friendliness feeling but he was busy looking into his laptop. 
But this point is very negligible when compared to above mentioned points. His Diagnosis is good!

To assume that we can treat a shoulder problem with Xrays of the lower back done 6 months ago is ridiculous. Most orthopaedic problems will need Xrays, which is a basic investigation. It is standard practice all over the world to take 2 or even 3 views of a particular joint. Xray examination is incomplete with inadequate views. We follow established protocols in treating every patient. There is no magic involved, neither is there any trickery. Certain problems have easy solutions, certain chronic degenerative conditions may only partially subside.

Every guest in our center is explained the requirement of a particular xray if the nature and duration of the problem warrants it. There is no compulsion to do the Xrays or any investigations at our center. We have a fixed charge for Xrays and they are not included in consultation fees.

Hope, this clarifies the picture for all future guests to our clinic.
