"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee Pain Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I had swelling in my both knees for about 2 to 3 months. I had no clue why it came up without any injury. I waited for it to subside, But it did subside by itself and again it came back. I visited a differnt doctor before meeting Srinidhi but it didnt help. Then after reading practo reviews I came to this doctor. He asked me to take some blood tests and after reviewing the tests he said I have this swelling in my knee due to high uric acid and also may be due to RA factor.  He suggested me to take uric acid medicine for some days and the swelling reduced but still it didnt go fully. So then again he gave medicine for RA factor. later it went off. I was in a doubt still i have the issue but doctor said I have recovered already. And now I am completely already without any diet restrictions that I had to do during the treatment.
