"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Spinal Therapy,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Amrithlal treated my brother for sciatica at Vikram Hospital, Bangalore. 
Dr. Amrithlal was very friendly, patient and explained the entire process of surgery and recovery. He did not for once pressure us to do more than was needed. 
I was especially impressed by his willingness to meet and answer all the questions we had. 
He eventually performed a successful surgery. The intense pain with sciatica has completed vanished. Thank You, Dr. Amrithal. You are indeed the type of doctor that I would want for not just my brother but for my entire family. 

I would recommend Dr. Amrithal without a doubt.
