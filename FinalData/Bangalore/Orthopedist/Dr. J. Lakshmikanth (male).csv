"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Elbow Pain,Wrist problems,",0,0,NO,"After waiting for almost 1 hr 15 mins , doctor received me and started his inspection. The least I expect from a doctor is to do an impartial thorough checkup where he can park his presumptions at the bay. 

Not just he was uninterested *** *** * ****** *** ** ********** *** ***** According to him my pain is caused because of incorrect position of my ulnar nerve but in last 30 years the position of that ‘funny nerve’ has never changed for me. Furthermore it is the same position in the other hand. He wasn’t able to explain why there was an elbow pain on weight bearing, screw tightening action and wrist clenching - which are the basics of examining the entire hand. And after 5 mins of inspection he advised - Surgery! Can you believe it. He didnt give any explanation to the blunt force trauma that I suffered and how it would have resulted in the pain. 

By the end of 5 mins of his inspection he was so disinterested that he didnt cater to my other issue of neck pain. His diagnosis was that - it is due to lifestyle and there is nothing that can be done. I would have accepted that diagnosis if he would have been able to explain why this suddenly started only in last few weeks after my accident while the lifestyle has been like that for years. 

I am glad that I got myself checked again from another doctor *** ********** ******** *** ********* *** ********* *** ******* ****** ********* 

Overall - wouldn’t recommend the hospital nor the doctor.
