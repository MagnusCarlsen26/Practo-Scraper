"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Hi, This is Sunil. Our family met with a severe highway accident. I had a fracture on left thigh, damaged Tendon on foot, a deep cut on thigh and multiple cuts and abbressions with glass pieces everywhere. My mom had a fracture on foot and severe damage on face. Dr. Alagu Pandiyan Sir and his team treated us. I had to undergo operation for 4 long hrs with a rod in Thigh and multiple sutures. Dr. Alagu sir would visit me everyday and would be physically present during every wound dressing change. At every visit, he never missed to boost my morale. With 8 family members admitted at hospital, his every word meant a lot to me. With this second new life, I feel blessed to be treated under safe hands. I take this as a opportunity to Thank Dr. Alagu Sir and his team for giving us the best care. Thank you Dr. Alagu Sir. ",2022-07-15 08:07:55,False,True,Sunil Kumar BM,,,
