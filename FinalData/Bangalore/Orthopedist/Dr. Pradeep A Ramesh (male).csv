I happened to meet him when my daughter had to get her tibia bone surgery last year .
Doctor Pradeep handled it very well and explained us everything in detail regarding the surgery .
 He is very friendly and answered my queries patiently whenever I used to call him or text him.
Recently we got her implant removed by him which went on very smoothly and my daughter is fit and fine now.
I highly recommend Dr. Pradeep with great gratitude .

Thank you so much Sir .",2021-12-15 08:24:55,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
