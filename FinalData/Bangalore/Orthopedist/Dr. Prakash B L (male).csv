This was confirmed by the XRAYS and Bone Mineral Density Scan. I must compliment Dr Prakash's accurate diagnosis and disease prognosis too, the explanation was Lucid and very effective in our decision making. He started medication and advised TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT. The surgery was performed on 29Jan2021 in PROMED Hospital, Banashankari Stage II.

Doctor Prakash BL has scientifically & systematically explained the post surgery recovery procedure to the patient. The patient's co-operation is total.  He saw the patient two times every day, kept the patient cheerful and in good humour. He is accessible always and us just a call away, we found he responds immediately. 

Further his Communication is very good & effective. The pain management was awesome and very effective and so was the physiotherapy. Because she is Bengali, his recommended Physiotherapist - Dr Anirban Kundu also  was a WoW.  

Doctor never insisted or restricted with regard to food intake, but allowed to understand & evaluate on a day to day basis, which is helpful. Our next review with Dr Prakash BL is on 19Feb2021(Discharged on 04Feb2021).
