We have visited him for several different matters including hairline fractures, full on fractures and ligament tears and so on. He is a very kind and patient doctor and he explains the problem very well. Sometimes when other orthopaedics had recommended getting plasters applied for my grandma's fractures, she would find it extremely difficult to lift the part of the body which had the cast on. Dr Vishwanath has always recommended much more accessible and convenient methods for her that have made her recoveries much more comfortable and reassuring for my grandmother and I appreciate that very very much! Thank you Dr Vishwanath for your kind help and hospitality :)",2021-09-20 07:22:18,False,True,Anushree M D,,,

,,0,0,NO,"The doctor did not even look at the impacted area and refused to do any test as it would 'hurt too much'. Was in and out in a minute. It seemed like he was in a hurry to just get me to leave.On the contrary two doctors did movement tests, gave the same diagnosis and asked me to do an MRI.
