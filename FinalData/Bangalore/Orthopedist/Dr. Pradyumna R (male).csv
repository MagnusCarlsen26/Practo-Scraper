None,None,0,0,NO,"* * ********** ***** ****** ** ********** ******* ****** ******** A disastrous arthroscopy on my 70-year-old father's worn-out knee led to severe pain, immobility, and mental trauma due to inadequate medical advice *** **** ******* *****

I want to share a ****** ********* experience my family had with a medical procedure performed on my 70-year-old father. Initially, he was advised to undergo a knee replacement, but as a stop-gap solution, he suggested an arthroscopy instead.

Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disastrous decision. My father’s left knee was completely worn out, and the arthroscopy did nothing to address the problem. This surgery was performed on March 12th, by Dr. Pradyumna Raghu, followed by a review surgery a week later, which further deteriorated his condition. * *** *** **** ****** ** *** ********** ********* *** he has been in severe pain for over two months.

** **** ******* ****** *** ****** ******* ******** ******** *** ********** ****** *** ** *** **** * ******* ** * **** ** ********* ***** ** *** ******* ******* *** ***** ** *** ****** Despite this severe deterioration, the doctor failed to adequately prepare or counsel my father about the potential pain and complications.

When my father reached out to the doctor expressing his pain, he was met with ********* *** * lack of empathy. *** ********* ***** **** ********** ***** ** ****** ******* **** ****** *** **** ******* *** ******* **** ** *********** ******* ***** ****** ******* ***** ************* **** *** ******** ** ***** ********** *********** ** *** ******** ********** **** ** *** ******* ***** ** ****** *** ****** ********* *** *** *********

This whole ordeal has not only affected my father’s physical health but also caused immense mental trauma.

When confronted, he defended his actions by pointing out that the right knee (which also underwent arthroscopy) was fine. However, the right knee was not as deteriorated as the left one, making his justification invalid.

None,"Fracture Treatment,",0,0,NO,"It was suggested me to check for bone crush after 3 weeks of treatment.  Why couldn't they check it at the first attempt?
My finger is still not moving.

Also the person sitting on the counter was not professional.  She was touching my finger like an untrained professional.
She even included the stick that was given for finger support in the doctors consultation fee bill, and charged more than MRP for that.
When I asked for explanation She said it is system generated.  I don't understand how their system generates bill more than MRP.",2024-05-28 11:22:59,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
