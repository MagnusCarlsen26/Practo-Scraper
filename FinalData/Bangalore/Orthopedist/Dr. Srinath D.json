This I felt was a little steep but was told by my other Dr pals that its pretty much in line with other small hospitals), second time we went after a week or so.. Took another xray (310rs), Dr consulted (free), third time we went after 15 days.. Dr removed the pop (450rs - he was sweet enough to take only his consultation charges and nothing extra)... Overall liked his diagnosis and his approach towards kids, a thorough professional... I would definitely recommend him and excel hospital both",
