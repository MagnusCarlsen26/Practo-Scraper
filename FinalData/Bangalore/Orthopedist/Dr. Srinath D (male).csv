"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My 4 year old kid fractured her hand.. Took treatment from Dr srinath at excel hospital bsk... He was very sweet and kind, soft spoken, ****** ** **** **** ********* ** *** ** ****** ****** *** ** ** ***** ******* First time we took xray (310rs) and then Dr consulted (450rs) and decided to apply pop (2000rs.. This I felt was a little steep but was told by my other Dr pals that its pretty much in line with other small hospitals), second time we went after a week or so.. Took another xray (310rs), Dr consulted (free), third time we went after 15 days.. Dr removed the pop (450rs - he was sweet enough to take only his consultation charges and nothing extra)... Overall liked his diagnosis and his approach towards kids, a thorough professional... I would definitely recommend him and excel hospital both",2019-02-19 11:21:04,False,True,Kedar ,,,
