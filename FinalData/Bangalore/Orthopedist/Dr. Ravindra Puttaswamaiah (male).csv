"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spine Injury,",0,0,NO,"I took my Mom to visit doctor Ravindra. She had been suffering from pain on her left hip to toe since a long time. On the day of visit, she was in severe pain and I visited the hospital with prior appointment. My mom wasn't in a position to sit or stand due to pain. The Nurse told I have to go inside doctor's cabin after 2 patients, so we were waiting anxiously. However, the doctor has a woman asistant who comes out to call patients every time. I am sure, she follows no appointment order and calls inside people to see the doctor, whomever she likes. So we could see that people came in 5 mins ago and met the doctor, but we waited like for 1.5 hours. Meanwhile my mom was facing much more trouble due to pain, so I confronted the woman. She went to see the doctor inside, then came out and told "" doctor said to go to emergency dept, if you can't wait"". I was totally shocked at such unprofessional behaviour from staff of Columbia Asia. We waited for 1.5 hours and when I demanded my Mom to be checked, the lady comes and tells us to go to emergency. If that is the case, then why wa-ste our 1.5 hours and tell us that our no. is after 2 patients? Also, while sitting there and observing closely, I could see that the lady would come out and call South Indian patients irrespective of their appointment time to visit the doctor first. Afterwards, she calls other patients. **** * ******* ******Finally, when we met the doctor, he did all check up and read reports and suggested ""Microdiscectomy"" surgery for my Mom. As it was a shock for us, I asked him to give us 2 days time to discuss and take the call. So the doctor asked that lady to take my number and call on Saturday w.r.t the surgery decision. Ironically, she never called in-spite of noting down my number at the doctors cabin and I didn't have any other contact to speak personally to the doctor. Anyways, I was furious with the behaviour of such callous staff of Columbia Asia.

Finally, I visited another good and reputed hospital in the same vicinity. ** ***** ******* **** **** *** *** ** ****** **** ** *** ***** ********* *** ******* *** ***** **** **** ***** **** ***** ************ ***** ***** ******** *** ***** ******** ** ***** ******* I would never visit such hospital and such doctor *** ***** **** ************** ****** ** ***** ******* ***** Anyways, loss is theirs and I got my mom treated **** at another hospital.

P.S: The doctor was good but, when he asked us to go to emergency; it was a true let down. If someone is seriously ill and waited for 1.5 hours to see you, you need to understand the pain of the person and not dismiss them like some false case. Also, he might not be aware of his helping hand 'the lady' who lacks basic humanity and follows no rules. ",2019-04-20 19:16:06,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Foot Injury Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I visited Dr. Puttuswamy on 16.3.17. Told him about the history of injury and said 'i believe its the same ligament issue'. He barely examined my foot & asked for x-ray done. Said its just a foot sprain. Rest for 2 weeks and it will be fine. Also he laughed at me when i asked for wheel chair assistance saying 'you worry a lot, just walk home and relax. 

 Its been a year i am not able to visit gym of walk freely. Finally went to another doctor. He touched my foot and said ""ligament injury"", explained about it and asked for MRI scan. Scan showed the same result. He did a leg cast next day and now I am on rest.*** ********* **** ** ** **** ** ****** ** **** ****** ** *** ***********  Its been a year of constant pain and struggle. Had received the correct treatment sooner, I would have recovered till now.

I had a problem in spine which was misdiagnosed when I was abroad. I came back to India and consulted him, it was diagnosed within one day and within three days I was on correct treatment. Understanding the urgency of situation, Dr. Ravindra went out of his way to help me and arranged everything for me at he hospital so that my treatment does not get delayed. He has effectively treated our issues.

Also, his assistant Kavitha is really understanding and helpful. She arranges the consultations and makes sure that all the needs of the patient are met with no doubts in mind.",2023-04-25 11:42:02,False,True,Rohit Kashyap,,,
