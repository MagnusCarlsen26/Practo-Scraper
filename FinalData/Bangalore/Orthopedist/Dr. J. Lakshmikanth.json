He also explained nicely.He didn't prescribe any medicine but some exercises. my mother is now completely fine now.* Only thing doctor should think about his assistant who makes Xray reports and all.

Furthermore it is the same position in the other hand. He wasn\u2019t able to explain why there was an elbow pain on weight bearing, screw tightening action and wrist clenching - which are the basics of examining the entire hand. And after 5 mins of inspection he advised - Surgery! Can you believe it. He didnt give any explanation to the blunt force trauma that I suffered and how it would have resulted in the pain. \n\nBy the end of 5 mins of his inspection he was so disinterested that he didnt cater to my other issue of neck pain. His diagnosis was that - it is due to lifestyle and there is nothing that can be done. I would have accepted that diagnosis if he would have been able to explain why this suddenly started only in last few weeks after my accident while the lifestyle has been like that for years. \n\nI am glad that I got myself checked again from another doctor *** ********** ******** *** ********* *** ********* *** ******* ****** ********* \n\nOverall - wouldn\u2019t recommend the hospital nor the doctor. \n\nPS - Practo has mentioned the fees to be 500 but they charged me 850",

Based on his vast experience, he always recommended to me a conservative approach to treatment - rest, and medication only if required, and most importantly advising against surgery and considering it to be only am extreme and last resort.

Furthermore it is the same position in the other hand. He wasn\u2019t able to explain why there was an elbow pain on weight bearing, screw tightening action and wrist clenching - which are the basics of examining the entire hand. And after 5 mins of inspection he advised - Surgery! Can you believe it. He didnt give any explanation to the blunt force trauma that I suffered and how it would have resulted in the pain. \n\nBy the end of 5 mins of his inspection he was so disinterested that he didnt cater to my other issue of neck pain. His diagnosis was that - it is due to lifestyle and there is nothing that can be done. I would have accepted that diagnosis if he would have been able to explain why this suddenly started only in last few weeks after my accident while the lifestyle has been like that for years. \n\nI am glad that I got myself checked again from another doctor *** ********** ******** *** ********* *** ********* *** ******* ****** ********* \n\nOverall - wouldn\u2019t recommend the hospital nor the doctor. \n\nPS - Practo has mentioned the fees to be 500 but they charged me 850",
