"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"Hi all, today I will be sharing the knee replacement journey for my mother Mita Kanjilal (aged 67 years).
From past 5 - 6 years she was having difficulty in walking due to much work. 


It aggravated to unbearable pain in the last couple of years affecting his mobility in the recent months.
Just before the surgery the pain was so severe that she was unable to stand straight and once she sits somewhere it was very difficult for her to get up by herself.

When it almost reached an ultimatum, surgery was the only choice.

Search began for the best orthopedics doctor and hospital with proved track record.
Initially we visited Narayana hospital and consulted with an orthopedic, no doubt he was good.
Although before proceeding with the surgery we just wanted to have a second opinion and that time we have consulted Dr Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya.
Immediately after the first consultation me and my family felt that this is the doctor we should go for.
The way he explained the current situation post X-RAY was noteworthy and also the behavior and calmness.

Finally, after the 2nd consultation we have decided to go for the surgery based on our preferred date.

His patient hearing (answering to every small question clarifying doubt), thorough examination, transparent genuine diagnosis, understandably explaining the medical condition/problem, and the treatment options available to rectify the issue was extremely convincing and there was no looking back.

Dr. Kumardev kept checking on us at every step pre and post-surgery. His personal attention to every patient even with his busy schedule from the initial stage is highly commendable
He explained in detail the surgery procedure and all the care we should take almost every single day, he even let us meet with his existing patients in order to gain more confidence before we actually go for the surgery.

During our stay in the hospital, the Doctor guided the Hospital staff at every step, took personal care, and monitored all the parameters regularly.

My Mother was made to walk with an aide on the second day of the surgery and was discharged from the hospital on the eight days since we had to go through total knee replacement for both the knees.


Dr. Kumardev disciplined approach, extreme expertise in his area, and continuous monitoring care helped in the speedy recovery of my mother.
Doctor gave us an elaborate list of Dos and Don'ts post-surgery and during discharge which helped my mother and us to take care of him.
It is extremely fulfilling to see my mother recover so quickly and back to his normal activity almost 2 - 3 months post-surgery. 

We would highly recommend Dr. Kumardev amongst all our family and friends.",2022-11-28 16:22:44,False,True,Deepanjan Kanjilal,,,

since 2010. When she turned 54 her knee joints resulted in abnormal swelling and
paining. She Used to apply different Ayurvedic oils and Ayurvedic treatment. Took continuous
painkillers for daily relief. Her Orthopedician gave 3 maximum steroid Injections on both the
knees. All this resulted in temporary relief only but not permanent cure. 24×7 pain was felt in
both knees. Unable to climb steps. She stopped walking despite doctor's advice resulting into
weight gain. She stopped doing her yoga exercises as stretching legs was no more possible.
1. First we had consulted Orthopedicians in Mumbai (as we were there) who advised knee
transplantation. Thereafter we shifted to Bengaluru and since 2016 onwards we started
consulting different doctors for their 2nd opinions. All most all the doctors from the very
beginning told that she required immediate Total knee implants of both the right and left legs as
the cartridge of both the legs was worn out.
2. My son searched the Internet and concluded with information gathered based on ratings of Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya, Orthopedician, Manipal hospital, Whitefield, Bengaluru. Immediately we took appointment and consulted the
Doctor. The doctor advised immediate both the knee transplantation as it was overdue from
2016. He also told any further delay in surgery would result into bending of legs, the deformity of
which cannot be repaired thereafter. The Doctor also very positively advised that my wife can
easily go to the US after 3 months of surgery with good home Physiotherapy.
3. Thereafter my wife underwent detailed blood tests required by the Doctor. Dr. Kumardev attended immediately and planned surgery first for Right knee
on 05/07/2021 morning. She has been fasting since the evening of 04/07/21. On 05/07/21 morning at
08:00 am. She was taken into Operation Theater. We were told that my wife was given total General anesthesia and the surgery would take 2-3 hours. Right knee surgery was
successfully finished by 12:00 pm. and the Doctor told that he would take up surgery of her left
knee on 08/07/2021 based on her tolerance of pain. Thereafter in the evening, Physiotherapy
started for her and she was asked to walk with crutches. She was complaining some pain under
anesthesia effect. But later in the evening and next day it was more. But by 07/07/2021 night
The pain got reduced and got ready for left knee surgery on 08/07/21. Accordingly, she was
operated her Right knee on 08/07/21. Thereafter she was in the hospital for 5 days. She did
physiotherapy in the morning and night. She was discharged after that with instructions to
undergo home physiotherapy for 3 months. We utilized the services of Mr. Jyothi Kiran,
Physiotherapist, Manipal hospital, Whitefield who was daily morning and evening used to visit
our house and made my wife alright. He is a thorough professional in physiotherapy.
4. Our interactions with Dr. Kumardev during this period was outstanding. His timely, deeply and
advice helped my wife to gain total confidence. She started walking at home
with the support of a physiotherapist for 2 months. But started walking independently without
crutches and others support. She was fully alright by 30/09/2021
and we were happily ready to go to the USA from 08/10/2021.

forgetting her pain that was there prior to surgery.

Although it started with minimal pain in the initial years, it aggravated to unbearable pain in the last couple of years affecting his mobility in the recent months. Starting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Allopathy, etc. he tried almost all the therapies available to get relief from the pain – nothing really worked! Surgery was the last option on his mind - due to the apprehension of surgery, hospitalization, post-surgery recovery/dependency, success rate, fright, age, etc. 

When it almost reached an ultimatum, surgery was the only choice. Search began for the **** doctor and hospital with proved track record; finally was referred to Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya by our cousin Dr. Manjunath Bhat. While the reviews on the net were very encouraging, our first consultation with the Doctor further boosted our optimism, assurance, and trust to proceed with the surgery. His patient hearing (answering to every small question/clarifying doubts),  thorough examination, transparent/genuine diagnosis, understandably explaining the medical condition/problem, and the treatment options available to rectify the issue was extremely convincing and there was no looking back. Just with a single meeting, we were won over – and were visualizing the positive side of my Dad getting to normal (all constraints seemed to be of less importance).  After all the preliminary tests and procedures, my Dad underwent the left Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery in March 2020 at the Manipal Hospital, Whitefield under the able hands of the Doctor. 

Dr. Kumardev kept checking on us at every step pre and post-surgery. His personal attention to every patient, even with his busy schedule from the initial stage is highly commendable/exceptional as it builds a very good rapport and helps the patient to foster trust – which is very important for the success of any procedure and recovery.

During our stay in the hospital, the Doctor guided the Hospital staff at every step, took personal care, and monitored all the parameters regularly. My Dad was made to walk with an aide on the second day of the surgery and was discharged from the hospital on the fourth day. Dr. Kumardev’s disciplined approach, extreme expertise in his area, and continuous monitoring/care helped in the speedy recovery of my Dad’s condition.

Radiology investigations reported angulated displaced fracture both bone of distal 1/3 left forearm.
We were very worried and the doctor explained in very detail about the severity of the issue and recommended

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Orthopedic Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My mom had a fall and femur bone fracture in March 2022. She has having osteoporosis and so her bone health was not in good shape. Sha had a fall while walking in the campus where we stay. Looking at her condition we were worried that the fracture is of very bad type. 
Anyways we called the ambulance and took her to the hospital. 
The nearest hospital was Manipal Whitefield (Near ITPL/ Opp Prestige Shantiniketan Mall)) and we were there in emergency in under 20 minutes. There the doctors immediately took her inside and after scans confirmed the fracture. Now it was a complicated one as she was 72 years old and her bone health was bad as well. The emergency doctor directed us to Dr Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya in OPD whom I met with the scan report and he explained the surgery process and how he is going to treat her.  One thing I have to add here is that mom's accident was on a weekend and on Sundays you have very few doctors who attend to surgeries. Anyways given my mom's condition Dr Kumardev took decision to do the surgery on Sunday itself and got her moved to inpatient from emergency. Surgery was long - almost 6 hours, and it was successful. Post surgery mom had to go through a elaborate physiotherapy plan. Very happy to state that after 6 months of surgery and rehab my mom was able to walk independently. It took time given her state but throughout this journey Dr Kumardev and his team has been extremely supportive and helped me through all queries. The doctor even shared his contact details and allowed me to reach out to him for immediate queries. Who does this in today's world? 
Overall I am thankful to God that I took the decision to take my mom to Manipal Whitefield and luckily met Dr Kumardev. Thankfully my mom is back on her feet and is totally independent like she was before.

Big thanks to the expert Dr Kumardev, her life got completely transformed. From the days of continuous suffering, lack of mobility, dependency on others into independence in mobility, freedom and zero pain. Here are some important points to note while preparing for knee replacement surgery: 1. Patient's readiness and positive attitude is of prime importance. Dr Kumardev is very good at councelling. His soft voice and talking from Patient's view point gives big confidence booster.2. Since most of the cases it's a planned surgery, take your time to prepare thoroughly for 5-6 days of hospitalization 3. Depending on Patient's condition, doctor will take call if to do both knee replacement on same day or stagger over 2 days. **** ***** ** ******** ** **** ******. 4. Post surgery for first few days, there will be immense pain in legs. Both Patient and care taker need to be ready, have patience and faith in doctor. Just follow what he says. 5. Post discharge, most important is to do very sincere physiotherapy for at least for 2 months. A good physiotherapist is key. We were lucky to get Ankita as physiotherapist from Manipal hospital.6. There will be some pain during physiotherapy but if patient tolerates it for few days, it will help immensely for faster recovery and complete gain back of knee movement.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I have consulted Dr. Kumardev for my mother. She was having pain in both the knees for almost 10 years. I tried my best to convince my mother to get knee transparent for past 10 years. In 2017 I was able to convinced her to come with me to Manipal hospital.
We did all the test and she was diagnostic with grade 4 (Last stage) arthritis. We were almost ready to get the surgery but in the last moment she backed off (Due to fear mongering by relatives)
Four year passed and pain start growing from bad to worse. This time pain was unbearable and finally she said ""YES"" to have surgery.

I decided to take her to Manipal Whitefield again. One of my friends is working in Manipal and she suggested to have consultation with Dr Kumardev. As suggested by her we consulted Dr. Kumardev and my mother was diagnostic with same grade 4 arthritis!!
Dr Kumardev explained us everything in details about her condition and suggested to go for surgery. He explained everything patiently about surgery. He gave lot of confidence to my mother and finally my mother was more confident about surgery!!
Finally, the judgement day came and on 24-Feb-2021 left knee was operated on and 26-Feb-2021 right knee was operated on. Both the surgeries were successful and she is in much better situation now.
It’s very important to choose the right doctor for surgeries. I would highly recommend Dr Kumardev for orthopedic related issues. He is expert in his subject and take care of his patient very well.


Note: Physiotherapy is must after surgery otherwise surgery will not be that effective. We did physiotherapy for two-month post-surgery.",2021-04-24 12:24:27,False,True,Anil Kumar,,,

Anyways given my mom's condition Dr Kumardev took decision to do the surgery on Sunday itself and got her moved to inpatient from emergency. Surgery was long - almost 6 hours, and it was successful. Post surgery mom had to go through a elaborate physiotherapy plan. Very happy to state that after 6 months of surgery and rehab my mom was able to walk independently. It took time given her state but throughout this journey Dr Kumardev and his team has been extremely supportive and helped me through all queries. The doctor even shared his contact details and allowed me to reach out to him for immediate queries. Who does this in today's world? 
Overall I am thankful to God that I took the decision to take my mom to Manipal Whitefield and luckily met Dr Kumardev. Thankfully my mom is back on her feet and is totally independent like she was before.

Big thanks to the expert Dr Kumardev, her life got completely transformed. From the days of continuous suffering, lack of mobility, dependency on others into independence in mobility, freedom and zero pain. Here are some important points to note while preparing for knee replacement surgery: 1. Patient's readiness and positive attitude is of prime importance. Dr Kumardev is very good at councelling. His soft voice and talking from Patient's view point gives big confidence booster.2. Since most of the cases it's a planned surgery, take your time to prepare thoroughly for 5-6 days of hospitalization 3. Depending on Patient's condition, doctor will take call if to do both knee replacement on same day or stagger over 2 days. **** ***** ** ******** ** **** ******. 4. Post surgery for first few days, there will be immense pain in legs. Both Patient and care taker need to be ready, have patience and faith in doctor. Just follow what he says. 5. Post discharge, most important is to do very sincere physiotherapy for at least for 2 months. A good physiotherapist is key. We were lucky to get Ankita as physiotherapist from Manipal hospital.6. There will be some pain during physiotherapy but if patient tolerates it for few days, it will help immensely for faster recovery and complete gain back of knee movement.

She was having pain in both the knees for almost 10 years. I tried my best to convince my mother to get knee transparent for past 10 years. In 2017 I was able to convinced her to come with me to Manipal hospital.
We did all the test and she was diagnostic with grade 4 (Last stage) arthritis. We were almost ready to get the surgery but in the last moment she backed off (Due to fear mongering by relatives)
Four year passed and pain start growing from bad to worse. This time pain was unbearable and finally she said ""YES"" to have surgery.

I decided to take her to Manipal Whitefield again. One of my friends is working in Manipal and she suggested to have consultation with Dr Kumardev. As suggested by her we consulted Dr. Kumardev and my mother was diagnostic with same grade 4 arthritis!!
Dr Kumardev explained us everything in details about her condition and suggested to go for surgery. He explained everything patiently about surgery. He gave lot of confidence to my mother and finally my mother was more confident about surgery!!
Finally, the judgement day came and on 24-Feb-2021 left knee was operated on and 26-Feb-2021 right knee was operated on. Both the surgeries were successful and she is in much better situation now.
It’s very important to choose the right doctor for surgeries. I would highly recommend Dr Kumardev for orthopedic related issues. He is expert in his subject and take care of his patient very well.


Note: Physiotherapy is must after surgery otherwise surgery will not be that effective. We did physiotherapy for two-month post-surgery.",2021-04-24 12:24:27,False,True,Anil Kumar,,,

As he working in Manipal hospital Whitefield, I thought he won't respond to us over phone call or thru whatsapp msg so easily. But surprisingly, he is really cool.

Then he also talked to the doctor who was doing first aid to my kid. Explained him what needs to be done until visiting Manipal. Since it was around 10PM, he asked us to observe in the night for any complications, if so asked us to visit hospital immediately, else asked us to bring our kid in the morning. We visited hospital next day early morning, Doctor already informed the facility for admission. Everything went very well with Doctor & the hospital. Surgery also went smooth. As it was the k-wire which they inserted into my kid's elbow to correct the position, there was one more follow up surgery to remove those wires. Initially we were scared regarding surgery & it's results. But everything went very well. We visited many times after the surgery to have a follow up consultation.

She had to undergo two surgeries in last 18 months after she fell down on road and broke her ulna and radius. Unfortunately, her first surgery was done at a substandard hospital in Kanpur and ended up in implant failure, the second surgery was done at a better hospital and she was recovering but she fell down again and broke the implant while the ulna fracture was still non-union after 16 months of refixation.I had met Dr. Kumardev a month prior to this while he was treating my cousin who was admitted to Manipal hospital in emergency after a road accident. My cousin was recovering well after the major patella surgery and he had a very positive experience with Dr. Kumardev, so he asked me to discuss my mother’s case with him. I sent him details of the case on whatsapp and took his opinion on phone all, he recognised me and discussed his treatment plan at length, I asked him about cost estimate as well and I was convinced to call my parents to Bangalore for surgery.This third procedure was so much more complex when compared to last two, as it involved removal of broken implant, non-union surgery and bone grafting. Fortunately, everything went as planned by Dr. Kumardev and my mother was discharged within 2 days of the admission. Dr was very serious about postoperative care and he prescribed best possible medicines to manage pain, ensure reunion and avoid any possible infection. He personally inspected the surgical wound on each followup visit until staples were removed.  Apart from being a very talented orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Kumardev is a great human being too, he gives ample time to patients, tries to understand their problems and also explains about the treatment in detail.

He initially performed surgery for left knee in the early morning. My mother shifted to room by afternoon. Doctor and Physiotherapist visited my mom in the evening and made her walk a little. We never expected that she could walk within hours of surgery. It gave us lot of confidence.
 
That’s when mother decided to go ahead with right knee joint replacement also. Doctor performed surgery for right knee on third day of admission. Thanks to Doctor for taking it step by step and infusing confidence in us with not only with his words, but also with his actions.

The accident was a result of falling due to imbalance from a small height. Despite that it resulted in a major injury because of the whole burden of my body weight. Post my elbow reduction, I did a research on whom to consult for the recovery. Thankfully Dr. Arvind's name came across.  There was a lot of fear and anxiety already on my mind regarding my ability to be at the same level of earlier fitness. However, after meeting him he gave me a candid review of the situation and the possibilities  in which the recovery may go in future. During the multiple sessions, he had been extremely careful open yet honest about the situation in hand.  What i liked the most is his entire approach to keep things simple without inducing a sense of fear. To a certain extent with the help of his motivation, I was psychologically more  geared up to put my effort towards the physiotherapy process.  In the beginning my dislocation also created a ligament injury and a certain extra bone growth. With the help of his suggested medication and methodological approach, I have healed mostly with the complete range of movement. My extra bone growth has also disappeared. In future also he will my remain go-to doctor for any orthopaedic related issues. My trust was further reinforced with his step by step approach.

My mother Mrs Usha Sarma was admitted to Manipal emergency after a horrible fall at home resulting in a left hip/thigh Femur Fracture of a very peculiar nature. The pain was excrutiating and we felt extremely helpless as we rushed her to the Manipal Whitefield emergency. Dr Kumardev examined her and very quickly diagnosed that the peculiar and rare nature of the fracture was due to the condition of osteoporosis combined with bisphosphonate medication issues which had made her bones extremely brittle. He recommended surgery. He also proactively diagnosed that there was another weak point on her right Femur which would soon lead to a similar fracture if unattended. He recommended surgery for both the Femurs. His ability to beautifully articulate the issues and the procedures step by step with a lot of patience helped us understand and feel comfortable that the right direction was being taken. He even guided us to papers written by the clinical community for this rare issue. We had by then realised that this was a very rare kind of fracture and there were not too many case studies. We prayed for the best. Dr Kumardev handled both the surgeries personally and with a lot of care and sensitivity to our frequent doubts and questions. The post surgery care and follow ups were also very nicely handled by him and his lovely team. We have been going for follow ups to him for over a year and a half now and every visit is filled with the exact situation explained beautifully, a lot of positivity and a personal touch. He has also been very open to us reaching out to him on whatsapp and phone over the last 1.5 years each time giving us a patient listening and the right directions. We are extremely grateful that we were in such able and caring hands. Now my mother is back to her completely normal self.

All this was achieved without any additional cut on my skin and without feeling a significant pain in this entire duration. During hospital admission, I interacted with few of his patient and everyone appreciated his expertize.

My thumb had lost its movement completely. It was all his efforts that made me fit and perfect today. That four hours of surgery for the tender repair was really showcasing the efforts that he put for which I m fine today. He also took help from Dr. Ramani sir who is a plastic surgeon so that their are not more scars on my hand.

I visited regularly and his suggestions an guidance and constant care helped me to recover my thumb movement.
