It is understandable that this Covid-19 Crisis has put extreme stress on all, with Healthcare sector being no exception. Great maturity is needed to have  clarity in mind that Doctor has given his complete attention, time and resources in a Teleconsultation before giving appropriate advice. Fee has been charged for the service already given. When the same person chooses physical consultation, Doctor is again giving his complete time & attention for physical examination, apply his resources and answer all the doubts by patient and relative. Hence it is not right to expect teleconsultation fee already paid to cover the new services sought in the form of physical consultation. It is felt that we were not wrong in charging Fee for Physical Consultation. However it is a different matter that the type of mature understanding we expect is not available in our Society, as Teleconsultation is an evolving concept in our Country.
It is not less than any defamation or harassment directed to us unnecessarily, to receive a false allegation while simultaneously suffering revenue loss as the Physical Consultation stands not paid by the Patient till today.

In an allotted time slot for a particular patient, the doctor can repeat his advice in simple english a few times for somebody who has attention deficit and not for a person asking the same thing for the sixth time.  Each patient who has been seen before and to be seen after need to be given equal importance.

It is fair that injection for pain relief is given in a patient who has not obtained relief with simple Tablets.

One can realise the response of patient to pain only after Injection is given and no technology as on today can predict a patient response before Injection is given.
One can always refuse an injection. It is only in infants & kids that injection is given forcefully by restraining the child and not at all in adults who can speak. It appears to be an emotional outburst and a frivolous matter.",2020-02-10T13:30:18+0000,Dr. Madan Temker
