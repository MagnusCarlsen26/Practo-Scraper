Now my Wrist has completely recovered and I am pleased by the Professionalism  shown by the Doctor throughout the fracture healing stage.I also admire him to answer all my and my family queries during each stages of the treatment and also empathize with me on the mental aspect of being mentally down after fracture.His kind words instilled confidence in me.\r\nWith this treatment I have enormous respect for Dr.Prashanth and I would definitely recommend Dr.Prashanth to my family and friends.",

The fracture required surgery and fixation by means of a titanium plate and screws. He explained me in detail about the procedure and recovery time. I was bit anxious before the surgery but he answered all my queries very patiently and in great detail. Surgery done by Dr.Prashanth was perfect (I being from the family of Doctors, I even took opinion from other Doctors and other Ortho Surgeons and all of them told by looking at x-ray that it's perfectly fixed) and even the medications prescribed by him worked very well and helped in effective management of post surgery pain. Even after the surgery, Dr.Prashanth has been very approachable and easily available to answer queries on whatsapp. Today is 4th week since the surgery and I feel a lot better. I religiously followed all instructions of Dr. Prashanth and did fingers and hand exercises and the range of movement in my fingers and wrist is quite improved now. Got my x-ray done again today after 4th week and the bone fixation is perfect. Have started physiotherapy now as advised by Dr. Prashanth and I am confident of full recovery in next few weeks as rightly informed by Dr.Prashanth prior to surgery. Strongly recommend Dr.Prashanth to all. ",

She did this for 2 weeks and did not feel any relief. Meanwhile, we were doubtful about arthritis so got an RA test done. The results came negative. So we took a second opinion and came to know it was pain just because of the fall, had no .. absolutely no symptom of arthritis, even after seeing the x-ray the second doctor confirmed that there is no sign of arthritis or baker's cyst.\n\n*** ** ******** *** **** ** ***** ** ********** **** **** ****** ** **** ** **** *** ***** ** ******** ********* **** ***** ****** *** ***** *** ********* ********** *** ***** **** ******* ** ****** ** ** ***** ** *** ** ******* **** *** **** ** ****** ********** *********** ** ** *** ********* ********** *** ****** ** ******* ** **** *** ** **** ** ******* *** Eating medication without having the disease and unnecessarily going into depression, that's what happened with my mother.\n\n",

By the time we took her to our regular doctor it had got infected. He immediately referred to Dr. Prashanth who could assess the problem well. He got the X-ray done and then drained the pus. He was not rushed at all, talked to my daughter and is very competent. At each stage he would explain why he is doing what he is doing, especially since this was a matter of dealing with a child. The visit schedule was created taking into account various practical considerations like festivals etc. I got to know that he is so popular only after walking in for the next appointment and getting to know that there are 15 people ahead of us! Anyways, he was considerate enough to conduct the few minute examination in-between patients. For the subsequent visit, I took an appointment a week before. Again, explained to us how it is going, got a second x-ray done and reevaluated.\n\nHe is a great example of how doctors should be: being communicative without going overboard, building trust with the patient and family and at the same time being competent with his work. \n\nHe is highly recommended. However, do take prior appointment, as given his popularity there tends to be a long waiting period.",

He kept on repeating that this is a follow up visit and he is still giving me all the time necessary. I couldn't appreciate how it matters if it is a follow up visit or a first visit. He was questioning me why I got the ultra sound scan so soon when he recommended to get the scan done after 2 weeks. He was of the opinion that my problem is very minor (there was a small chip fracture found in the ultra sound scan, but not in the x-ray ******* ** ***** **** ** *** ******. Apparently I have no right to be concerned about my problem just because it is minor and there are other people in this world who have bigger issues. All my pointed questions like\n\n- does it help if immobilized\n- does it help if surgical intervention is undertaken\n- does it heal on its own if care is taken by me\n- does it heal even if I go about my activities usually\n\nwere not answered.\n\nI was given a lecture that should not worry much because there are bigger problems that other people have. He was trying to make me feel guilty that I consulted him for, in his opinion, a small problem compared to all the other wrong things that happen.\n\nAt the end of it, he wasted his time and mine. I just walked off seeing the futility of trying to get my questions answered.\n\nI am no where questioning his skills. I am just questioning his empathy!",

He assured that no bone fracture and minor damage on ligament, which will get recovered over time. He gave some ointment and few tablets for pain relief. My 1st impression was not so good, I felt he talks too much. After 2 days, things did not get improved, rather knee started swelling. I went to a big hospital in Bellandur, where doctor consultation fees are very high. Before giving any advice, doctor asked to get x-ray and MRI done. Those tests are too expensive and time consuming. On receiving reports, doctor scared me by saying knee has to be operated. I came back and continued medication given by Dr. Prashanth. In few days I completely recovered and since then last 3 years I did not feel any issue with my knee.\nMy daughter is very tall compare to her age and she is in school basketball team. Once she fell down on knee and then frequently she used to complain about knee pain; we also observed knee swelling. We consulted Dr. Prashanth and he explained in very details how this is issue a natural for growing children when some time their bone and muscle grows in out of sync. Over time this issue will be automatically get rectified. He recommended few medication and that relieves her pain/reduce swelling. She continue playing basketball and knee issues are not observed frequently.\nFew days back I experienced severe pain near hip join and thigh muscle. Recently I had to drive long hours through Bangalore traffic. He explained in details about possible reason for pains and recommended rest for few days and medication. I recovered fully in 2 days.\n\nOverall I like about Dr Prashanth diagnosis and the way he explain in very details. He never advice for unnecessary test or medication.

Now my Wrist has completely recovered and I am pleased by the Professionalism  shown by the Doctor throughout the fracture healing stage.I also admire him to answer all my and my family queries during each stages of the treatment and also empathize with me on the mental aspect of being mentally down after fracture.His kind words instilled confidence in me.\r\nWith this treatment I have enormous respect for Dr.Prashanth and I would definitely recommend Dr.Prashanth to my family and friends.",

The fracture required surgery and fixation by means of a titanium plate and screws. He explained me in detail about the procedure and recovery time. I was bit anxious before the surgery but he answered all my queries very patiently and in great detail. Surgery done by Dr.Prashanth was perfect (I being from the family of Doctors, I even took opinion from other Doctors and other Ortho Surgeons and all of them told by looking at x-ray that it's perfectly fixed) and even the medications prescribed by him worked very well and helped in effective management of post surgery pain. Even after the surgery, Dr.Prashanth has been very approachable and easily available to answer queries on whatsapp. Today is 4th week since the surgery and I feel a lot better. I religiously followed all instructions of Dr. Prashanth and did fingers and hand exercises and the range of movement in my fingers and wrist is quite improved now. Got my x-ray done again today after 4th week and the bone fixation is perfect. Have started physiotherapy now as advised by Dr. Prashanth and I am confident of full recovery in next few weeks as rightly informed by Dr.Prashanth prior to surgery. Strongly recommend Dr.Prashanth to all. ",

She did this for 2 weeks and did not feel any relief. Meanwhile, we were doubtful about arthritis so got an RA test done. The results came negative. So we took a second opinion and came to know it was pain just because of the fall, had no .. absolutely no symptom of arthritis, even after seeing the x-ray the second doctor confirmed that there is no sign of arthritis or baker's cyst.\n\n*** ** ******** *** **** ** ***** ** ********** **** **** ****** ** **** ** **** *** ***** ** ******** ********* **** ***** ****** *** ***** *** ********* ********** *** ***** **** ******* ** ****** ** ** ***** ** *** ** ******* **** *** **** ** ****** ********** *********** ** ** *** ********* ********** *** ****** ** ******* ** **** *** ** **** ** ******* *** Eating medication without having the disease and unnecessarily going into depression, that's what happened with my mother.\n\n",

Normally ignorant patients get depressed due to this which aggravates their pain further both physically and mentally.\n\nHe advises of exercises and this is something I liked the most as I believe our body should be tried for self healing rather than medications.\n\nHe has never prescribed costly medicines, which is again an unfair practice by other doctors now-a-days.\n\nHe will ask for the tests like X-rays, MRI, etc. only when the medicines give no results after a defined time span.\n\nOverall, I feel he always ensures that the patient should never spend more than required for the cure.\n\nI would like to recommend him for any sort of ortho issues.",

By the time we took her to our regular doctor it had got infected. He immediately referred to Dr. Prashanth who could assess the problem well. He got the X-ray done and then drained the pus. He was not rushed at all, talked to my daughter and is very competent. At each stage he would explain why he is doing what he is doing, especially since this was a matter of dealing with a child. The visit schedule was created taking into account various practical considerations like festivals etc. I got to know that he is so popular only after walking in for the next appointment and getting to know that there are 15 people ahead of us! Anyways, he was considerate enough to conduct the few minute examination in-between patients. For the subsequent visit, I took an appointment a week before. Again, explained to us how it is going, got a second x-ray done and reevaluated.\n\nHe is a great example of how doctors should be: being communicative without going overboard, building trust with the patient and family and at the same time being competent with his work. \n\nHe is highly recommended. However, do take prior appointment, as given his popularity there tends to be a long waiting period.",

He was questioning me why I got the ultra sound scan so soon when he recommended to get the scan done after 2 weeks. He was of the opinion that my problem is very minor (there was a small chip fracture found in the ultra sound scan, but not in the x-ray ******* ** ***** **** ** *** ******. Apparently I have no right to be concerned about my problem just because it is minor and there are other people in this world who have bigger issues. All my pointed questions like\n\n- does it help if immobilized\n- does it help if surgical intervention is undertaken\n- does it heal on its own if care is taken by me\n- does it heal even if I go about my activities usually\n\nwere not answered.\n\nI was given a lecture that should not worry much because there are bigger problems that other people have. He was trying to make me feel guilty that I consulted him for, in his opinion, a small problem compared to all the other wrong things that happen.\n\nAt the end of it, he wasted his time and mine. I just walked off seeing the futility of trying to get my questions answered.\n\nI am no where questioning his skills. I am just questioning his empathy!",

He assured that no bone fracture and minor damage on ligament, which will get recovered over time. He gave some ointment and few tablets for pain relief. My 1st impression was not so good, I felt he talks too much. After 2 days, things did not get improved, rather knee started swelling. I went to a big hospital in Bellandur, where doctor consultation fees are very high. Before giving any advice, doctor asked to get x-ray and MRI done. Those tests are too expensive and time consuming. On receiving reports, doctor scared me by saying knee has to be operated. I came back and continued medication given by Dr. Prashanth. In few days I completely recovered and since then last 3 years I did not feel any issue with my knee.\nMy daughter is very tall compare to her age and she is in school basketball team. Once she fell down on knee and then frequently she used to complain about knee pain; we also observed knee swelling. We consulted Dr. Prashanth and he explained in very details how this is issue a natural for growing children when some time their bone and muscle grows in out of sync. Over time this issue will be automatically get rectified. He recommended few medication and that relieves her pain/reduce swelling. She continue playing basketball and knee issues are not observed frequently.\nFew days back I experienced severe pain near hip join and thigh muscle. Recently I had to drive long hours through Bangalore traffic. He explained in details about possible reason for pains and recommended rest for few days and medication. I recovered fully in 2 days.\n\nOverall I like about Dr Prashanth diagnosis and the way he explain in very details. He never advice for unnecessary test or medication. So far I am very happy with end results and have recommended many of my friend whenever they are in need of orthopedics.\n",

Following is my feedback: He demonstrated good patience by listening to my problem and symptoms. He explained my condition in a detailed manner. Very direct and straight-forward in his views. His advice was very reassuring and comforting. He suggested to get a X-Ray (Knee Skyline) to determine any tracking problem, fortunately the X-Ray report was negative. He then prescribed supplements for my knee cartilage regeneration. The entire process (registration > clinical assessment > X-Ray > prescription > explanation > wrap-up) took only 45mins without much waiting time. I thank Dr. Prashant for his time and suggestions.",

Also, he asked me to consult him if and only if I don't recover in 10 days. Gem of a doctor. I'm glad that I consulted Dr.Prashant.",

I went to meet him regarding my lower back pain problem with lot of fear in my mind, what that could be as I was suffering from that for almost a month. Within few minutes of check up and advises given by the Doctor, I could get rid of my fear. He taught some easy exercises and advised for some checks to identify the root of the problem. All done and he identified the core problem and prescribed medicines accordingly. \r\n\r\nI liked his practical approach of diagnosing and giving confidence to patients, it's curable. I should say my pain is half gone, through the confidence I got after I met him. I am getting better now through the medicines and exercises advised by the Doctor been followed .. Thanks a lot Doctor!!!",

I am yet to start with the medication so I can't comment yet on how well my body will respond to that. However, doctor is extremely humble, gives time to listen to your issues and physical examination, he doesn't rush you to get over with soon and call in next patient. overall we had a great experience with doctor as other reviews here had suggested me. He even examined my husband's arm issues and gave his opinion free. I am glad I could find a reliable doctor like him.",

After examining her condition, he advised medicine as well as exercises. Unlike other orthopedic doctors, he didn't advise us to unnecessarily do MRI scan or X-Ray. He also encouraged to do a  X-ray at Apollo clinic for which he didn't charge also. I hope the treatment will work. I would definitely recommend Dr. Prashanth to all my friends and family. However i have only one complaint regarding the timings. Even though i took appointment at 7:30 PM through Practo, but when my turn came in, it was almost 9 PM. For this, clinic has to properly plan the appointments.\n",

His main quality is that after giving the treatment he elobrates the causes and effects of problem in very detail. Literally I am very impressed after seeing his knowledge about his field. The best part was when my daughter went to hospital at that time she was crying but after the treatment from Dr. Prashant she came out from hospital with smile. Even my 3 year daughter realised the same thing regarding the doctor because after reaching to home she told me that doctor uncle was very good and now I can do proper movement of my hand.",
