Its our policy that we understand the patient's problems completely & then explain in detail what investigations are required and for what purpose & only then proceed further. 

Only after the relevant X rays is it possible to diagnose certain problems & after that the right treatment is advised. 

Again, certain conditions require initial rest/physiotherapy & only after that exercises are started. 
Starting activities/exercises too soon can worsen certain problems. 

Keeping all this in mind, the appropriate advice would have been given.

However, we firmly believe that we can only suggest what is good for you & finally the patient has to agree & give consent to any investigation or treatment that is advised. 

For the same reason, we do not collect the consultation fee or the investigation charges at the beginning but do so only after explaining & completing everything. 

Lastly, your consultation is valid for a week & you may always come back & discuss in detail any concerns that you may have. 

We apologize once more for not being able to meet your expectations & will strive harder to improve our services.

Total Orthocare ",2020-09-25T08:35:36+0000,Dr. Shuaib Kausar
