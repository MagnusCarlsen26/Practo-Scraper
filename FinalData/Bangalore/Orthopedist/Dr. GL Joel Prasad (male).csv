"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pain Management for Chronic Back Pain,",0,0,YES,"Extremely happy and satisfied with Dr Joel treatment. Met him on the recommendation of a friend for a back pain issue which I was suffering for past few weeks. Tried all modalities but to no avail . All that was required was ' one touch to my spine  ' by Dr joel to diagnose right away that I had a bad muscle spasm and no bony issue . Though I requested for an x Ray he outrightly declined stating that an x Ray is of no use to me as he's already diagnosed the condition. Just one day of meds is all what I required to get significant relief in my symptoms . Very happy with his immaculate diagnosis, minimal investigation and treatment.
