There are more reason why I am so much impressed by Dr. Naveen & Dr. Rajeev.
I had come to ‘Sports Orthopedics Institute’ with my 4 yrs old AC Joint dislocation injury. This place was my last stop or destination of my hunt to know what are the treatment options I could have, for last 4yrs. Ever since the injury happened, I had seen 4 supposedly best orthopedic surgeons of the town, 2 among them were even foreign return retd. Doctors, but couldn’t even tell me what has actually happened inside the skin at my left shoulder, why 1 of the bone end is bulging up and what should be done to it. One retd. Visiting doctor suggested me to undergo a month physiotherapy treatment (if I am not wrong then this works when issue is at rotator-cuff), however I got that done too very religiously (that costed me a bomb too), when the X-ray report had nothing about rotator-cuff.
I tried again after 4 yrs to see if I can find some better doctor online, who can tell me what are the treatment options available for my injury in our country. In the process, read few recommendation about Dr. Dynamic Duo and gave a last try after complete disappointment for the doctors of the town. But to my surprise, I found them coming down to the phone line just like any friend awaiting for your call for quite sometime. Welcome with such a bright smile on their faces. But the most important thing for me was they kind of understood how exactly I had the injury in gym. Unlike any other clinic or doctors, they both examined me separately and suggested me very frankly, what can be done & what %age of strength can be expected back in future. Also, they were kind enough to suggest me should I go for the surgery or not.
