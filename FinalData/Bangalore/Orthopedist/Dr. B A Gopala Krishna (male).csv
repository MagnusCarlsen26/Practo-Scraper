Even when he was not available in the hospital because you requested sir, he obliged to give you a medical certificate from his clinic. And to tell you for a doctor attending  patients who come with some or other suffering is more important than giving a medical certificate for travel . ( Which you should have collected from front office clerk in the hospital)
The particular day when you sent a person to collect medical certificate, doctor had too many patients, inspite of that he requested his colleagues doctor to prepare certificate and he has sent you the same and at no extra cost for you.  
What else you expect from a Doctor.
