Today, our daughter experienced a wrist bone fracture during her skating class, which led us to seek medical attention at Sunshine Hospital Horamavu. At that facility, it was confirmed that our daughter had indeed suffered a fracture, and the medical team recommended surgery as the solution.\n\nDuring this challenging time, a close friend from our circle recommended Dr. K. K. Subbiah, and we are profoundly thankful for that suggestion. After assessing the X-ray, Dr. Subbiah determined that surgery was not necessary. Instead, he proposed a less invasive approach, which involved manually realigning the bone and ensuring it was properly positioned. This procedure would be painful for our child, but the doctor assured us that she could endure it without the need for anesthesia.\n\nDr. Subbiah's hands-on approach, extensive experience, and deep understanding of the root causes of medical issues were immediately evident. He explained the situation with utmost clarity, making what initially seemed like a complex problem appear surprisingly straightforward. \n\nOur heartfelt thanks go out to Dr. Subbiah for resolving our daughter's medical issue in just 15 minutes.

Today, our daughter experienced a wrist bone fracture during her skating class, which led us to seek medical attention at Sunshine Hospital Horamavu. At that facility, it was confirmed that our daughter had indeed suffered a fracture, and the medical team recommended surgery as the solution.\n\nDuring this challenging time, a close friend from our circle recommended Dr. K. K. Subbiah, and we are profoundly thankful for that suggestion. After assessing the X-ray, Dr. Subbiah determined that surgery was not necessary. Instead, he proposed a less invasive approach, which involved manually realigning the bone and ensuring it was properly positioned. This procedure would be painful for our child, but the doctor assured us that she could endure it without the need for anesthesia.\n\nDr. Subbiah's hands-on approach, extensive experience, and deep understanding of the root causes of medical issues were immediately evident. He explained the situation with utmost clarity, making what initially seemed like a complex problem appear surprisingly straightforward. \n\nOur heartfelt thanks go out to Dr. Subbiah for resolving our daughter's medical issue in just 15 minutes.
