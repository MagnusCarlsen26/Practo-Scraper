"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Sciatica,Slip Disc,",0,0,YES,"     Visited for issuers with my Slip disc and Sciatica. The moment he stepped in to Hospital gave a friendly, broad smile with no attitude which makes anyone feel most comfortable. To my surprise he apologized for being just 5 minutes late to my scheduled appointment (9am), by mentioning that it's because of traffic hurdles which is hardly seen. His invaluable patience in clarifying my doubts, humbleness, depth of knowledge, making me understand my issues in a simpler way with examples were exemplary.  He is totally service oriented.  500/- Rs. consultation charges is nothing compared to the honest services he extended by giving full time, without rushing to wind up the case.        Doctor examined me physically, checked my MRI reports, explained in detail what the issue is with my lower back ( Spinal Stenosis ), filled in confidence to me by a  very detailed explanation of where the nerve is pinched, exactly where the canal is narrowed, why I have been  experiencing numbness, tingling, crawling sensations, difficulty in long standing and walking and he relieved off my worries and apprehension about surgery by making it very clear that all these symptoms will be reduced to 80-90% to least a normal life.       It's not an exaggeration if I say that Doctor G S Swamy is Godly, any patient whom he attends would experience the same feeling for sure, such a humble person he is.    Even when I mentioned that I had been to him for a second medical opinion only, there was no change in his attitude towards attending to me as an honest, service minded doctor.  Hats off to this godly personality.   How I wish all the doctors were like Sri G S Swamy.         Anyone with ortho  issues can consult him with no second thought, I assure that it's a worthy, very reasonable consultation with ultimate treatment. May God bless him with a very good health.           Our society badly needs such noble doctors.Thanks in abundance, Sir. ",2020-12-17 07:15:21,False,True,K Shakuntala,,,
