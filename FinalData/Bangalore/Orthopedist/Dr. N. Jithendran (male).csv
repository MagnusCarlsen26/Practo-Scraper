"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Reconstructive Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My nephew experienced a distressing incident that led to the amputation of his left middle finger. Upon searching for guidance, I came across positive Google reviews about Mr. Jitendran. I promptly contacted him, and to my relief, he not only provided immediate guidance on precautions to take for the amputated finger but also shared relevant videos through WhatsApp. 

On the 2nd of August, we reached Bangalore at 12:30 PM. Even before we arrived at the hospital, Mr. Jitendran had already communicated with the staff to prepare the operation theater. However, as we weren't fully aware of how serious is the surgery and the duration it would require, we had concerns about the financial aspects. Unfortunately, due to these concerns, we hesitated and decided to return to our hometown.

Upon reaching a nearby hospital, we came to comprehend the severity of the injury. Realizing the urgency, the parents made the decision to proceed with the surgery despite the late hour of 10:00 PM. I immediately reached out to Mr. Jitendran, explained the situation, and he assured us that he would perform the surgery.

In the early hours of the morning, at 2:45 AM, the operation theater was readied, and by 3:20 AM, the surgery commenced. The procedure concluded at 11:40 AM, and I am immensely grateful that it went well. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Jitendran for his exceptional kindness, dedication, and commitment.

I would wholeheartedly recommend consulting Mr. Jitendran for any surgical needs, given his remarkable qualities:

1. **Patience:** His patient and attentive approach helps ease anxieties.
2. **Availability:** Mr. Jitendran's responsiveness is unparalleled. He promptly attends to queries through WhatsApp and phone calls.
3. **Dedication:** His unwavering commitment to his patients' well-being is truly commendable.
4. **Friendliness:** He creates a comfortable environment with his friendly disposition.
5. **Down-to-Earth:** Despite his expertise, he remains approachable and grounded.

It is because of these qualities that I firmly believe he is an excellent choice for any surgical consultation or medical assistance within his specialization. Once again, a heartfelt thank you to Mr. Jitendran for his exceptional care and support.

He inspected my finger & gave 2 possible options, i.e., refixing the finger top or reconstruction of the lost finger top depends on the tissues condition of the crushed part. Later he found that the crushed part was unfit for refixing (microscopic observation) and went for reconstruction of the lost finger top using the cross finger flap method. After regular follow up/ checkup, I am glad to say that Dr. Jithendran Sir saved my finger, else it would have been a lifetime regret.

So i got my two of fingers with tip functioning and nails growing... Third finger without first cut of it... As I have lost full first cut with bone... It's wasn't possible to extend the length at the time.

I was unable to provide my missing parts to doctor due to misguided instruction by a doctor at my town... But even then doctor done a complex surgery to get my fingers functioning.

At a Friday evening 5pm
I had cut three fingers on my hand while cleaning my bike chain, then I immediately went to nearest hospital in my town Dharmapuri, TN.

At 5:20pm... The doctor from that hospital simply said this can't be attached, only flap is possible... didn't believe that was the case...

then at 9:00pm I immediately travelled to Bangalore St John's hospital there doctors asked me for missing parts, but sadly the hospital at my town simply dumped those in bin saying it's no use 😢. Then the doctor from St.johns told that without missing parts it's not possible to get fingers back to the same length.

I was devastated 😢😢, lost hope and admitted for morning surgery.

Then my sister was with me at the time to help me out, started searching in Google/Practo for surgeon in Bangalore... then we found Dr N.Jithendran and then we called him...

We called him morning at 8pm,
He picked our call immediately and asked about our case then he immediately understood and told us there was a possibility of reconstructive surgery...

Then I was discharged from st John's and went to Phoenix hospital where Dr N Jithendran also arrived and performed the surgery.

I was surprised at the speed and hope he gave... I'm so blessed now by Dr Jithendran sir... My fingers are functioning back like normal and now I can write and do work.",2022-11-02 17:29:23,False,True,Verified Patient,"Thank you for your positive feedback, your
