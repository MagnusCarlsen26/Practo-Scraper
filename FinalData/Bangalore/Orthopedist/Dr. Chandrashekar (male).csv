I have been under ayurvedic treatment for last 1 year in various ayurvedic hospitals. We (the family members) met Dr Chandrashekar in December 2019 and the doctor had recommended for surgery, but we were not ready at that time. Subsequently, we had enquired about the surgery with other patients who had undergone surgery and also on the internet and decided to have the surgery.  Unfortunately, due to COVID19 pandemic, we postponed our decision. As the situation worsened further we met Dr Chandrashekar at his clinic on the first week of October for consultation. After examining my condition, he suggested going for immediate surgery. Accordingly, I got admitted at Sakra World Hospital on the 9th of October after a COVID test. MRI and X-Ray investigation revealed more problems with my right hip and doctor suggested to go ahead with hip replacement surgery rather than knee replacement surgery. We were convinced by doctors explanation and gave consent for hip replacement surgery. On 10th October 2020, the surgery was successfully done. After the surgery, I was kept in post-operative ward for a while and thereafter shifted to ICU where I was well attended by doctors and the support staff. On 11th I was shifted to the room for follow up and treatment. After the surgery, I stayed in the hospital for 7 days, where I received good care and attention. 

We are extremely happy with the service provided at the hospital and particularly Dr Chandrshekhar and his team of doctors, physiotherapists, nursing staff etc.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I came to know about Dr Chandrashekar through my friends. Before meeting him, I got a consultation for my mom in the other two hospitals basically for her Knee replacement and her age is 71. As soon as we had a consultation at Sakra, by seeing her Xray, Doctor explained the condition. So we decided the date for her surgery on March 16th,2020. Luckily my mom never had any health issues except Knee's problem. Her both Knee replacement was done on the same day by Dr Chandrashekar. Everything went well and I met my mom in the recovery room soon after her surgery. I never felt bad about doing any small paperwork or running around because I was pretty sure and happy that approached the right doctor after doing some research. Doctor visited my mom every day and his humbleness, caring and talking to patient's family members with ease was so amazing. That boosted up my confidence level so much even after the surgery that my mom will recover soon. The team worked so well, and she was discharged just a day before the lockdown. I have to truly talk about the Physiotherapist Aneesh, who came to my home like a God. He underwent so much trouble during the initial lockdown time because police were not letting him come due to COVID . with all the hurdles, he makes sure visiting my mother everyday.Such a young and energetic person ,well suited for this profession with full of kindness.  His advice and exercise made my mom to feel better and better. After 2 weeks, Dr Renganath came home with another person to remove my mom‚Äôs sutures. This is something unbelievable and amazing support provided by the team and hospital. They said due to Covid, don‚Äôt bring the patient to hospital, we will come home to remove the suture. I never ever heard such support from any hospital in my lifetime. Truly amazing doctor, support and service . Now my mother is able to walk normally , she can sit comfortable, able to claim stairs and back to her routine lifestyle. I am thankful to god that I went to the right place for the surgery. I simply recommend anyone have the knee problem, pls visit Dr Chandrashekar P.

I took  my mom 2 weeks ago to see an Xray , and everything was perfect and doctor said she will not have problem for another 20 years. Doctor was showing all my moms, pics and videos shared by the Aneesh and how they follow up until the person recover fully . Doctor was so happy seeing my mother walking and I could realize his happiness true from his heart.
