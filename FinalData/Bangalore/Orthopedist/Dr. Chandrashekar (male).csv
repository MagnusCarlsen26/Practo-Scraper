"Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"Feedback and experience as provided by my father Sri Subrahmanyam Surampudi.

""I, Subrahmanyam Surampudi, aged 70 years, native of Visakhapatnam (A.P) is a patient of type II diabetes and HTN for the last 25 years. I underwent open heart surgery over 9 years ago and also having LS problem. The problem of osteoarthritis started nearly 18 years ago which has become very severe during the last 3 years. There was pain and deformity in both knees, difficultly in walking and climbing stairs. Doctors at Visakhapatnam advised TKR.
 As my children are staying in Bangalore I came here for consultation and treatment. Through internet and other sources, we came to know about the orthopedic surgeon Dr. Chandrashekar P. of SAKRA World Hospital.
We called on him for the first time on 12th April 2017. After seeing my X-rays and reports and other physical examination Dr. Chandrashekar advised for TKR. He was kind enough to spare about 45 minutes for us. He explained in detail step by step surgical procedures, pain management, post-operative care, physiotherapy, cost of package etc. He cleared all my doubts with regards to my existing diseases. He created hundred percent confidence in me for undergoing surgery without any fear. On my request, he also agreed to perform surgery as per our choice of auspicious date and time. 
He informed us that the surgery will be done first for one leg and after 5 days basing on the advice of cardiologist surgery will be done for the second leg, otherwise it will be done after a gap of one or two months.
The positivity, professionalism and encouraging words of Dr. Chandrashekar inspired me very much and made me to decide then and there only to handover my case to him. I have not gone for even for a second medical opinion.
I joined SARKA hospital on 11th May 2017 and the surgery was scheduled for 12th May 2017. On the morning of 12th May, the cardiologist checked up me and 2D echogram was done. Before the surgery Dr. Chandrashekar informed me that according to cardiologist my heart is in very good working condition and as such the surgery can be done for both the knees (bilateral) at a time. He explained about the advantages of a bilateral surgery. He also spoke to my family members and asked for consent. ** * **** ****** **** ************* **** ** *** **** ***** *** * ******** we agreed for bilateral surgery. Accordingly, bilateral surgery was done and I was discharged on 21st May 2017.
During my stay in hospital the personal care and affection shown by Dr. Chandrashekar is highly commendable. He is so simple and humble and while talking with my family members we felt that as if he is our own family member. The doctor patient relationship is wonderful. At the time of discharge the doctor told my son to give SMS for any problem without any hesitation and will reply soon. Accordingly, he gave immediate responses to our 2/3 SMS‚Äôs which boosted up our confidence levels. On our request, he suggested a physiotherapist who has done a wonderful job and made me fit well in advance to the scheduled target.
I express my gratitude to Dr. Chandrashekar and his team of doctors, physiotherapists, nursing staff and others.
I am a chronic patient having a couple of good doctor friends who are my spiritual colleagues. I have acquaintance with many doctors of various hospitals but I have never come across such a humble and patient caring doctor like Chandrashekar, maybe it is his nature by grace of God.
The surgery was successful, by the end of 4th week I was able to walk without assistance and also climbing stairs for which I shall be ever grateful to Dr. Chandrashekar.
I feel that the existence of eminent doctors like Chandrashekar in SAKRA, the image of SAKRA hospital will increase to a great extent.
I humbly pray my sadguru, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi to bestow his gracious blessings on Dr. Chandrashekar and his family for a long life, health, wealth and prosperity.

I have been under ayurvedic treatment for last 1 year in various ayurvedic hospitals. We (the family members) met Dr Chandrashekar in December 2019 and the doctor had recommended for surgery, but we were not ready at that time. Subsequently, we had enquired about the surgery with other patients who had undergone surgery and also on the internet and decided to have the surgery.  Unfortunately, due to COVID19 pandemic, we postponed our decision. As the situation worsened further we met Dr Chandrashekar at his clinic on the first week of October for consultation. After examining my condition, he suggested going for immediate surgery. Accordingly, I got admitted at Sakra World Hospital on the 9th of October after a COVID test. MRI and X-Ray investigation revealed more problems with my right hip and doctor suggested to go ahead with hip replacement surgery rather than knee replacement surgery. We were convinced by doctors explanation and gave consent for hip replacement surgery. On 10th October 2020, the surgery was successfully done. After the surgery, I was kept in post-operative ward for a while and thereafter shifted to ICU where I was well attended by doctors and the support staff. On 11th I was shifted to the room for follow up and treatment. After the surgery, I stayed in the hospital for 7 days, where I received good care and attention.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"Last October, i met with an accident on my two wheeler, resulting in an elbow fracture plus dislocation on my right hand, which required a surgery. I would say that it was pure luck that i landed into the hospital where Dr Chandrashekar is HOD, Ortho. The nature of my injury mandated a surgery, which was to be conducted by Dr Chandrashekar. Before the surgery, Dr Chandrashekar had an interaction with me, putting me at ease, saying that he will fix my elbow. He also properly explained me the condition of my elblow, along with the restrictions that i might have subsequently, given my injury. Thankfully, i had a pretty successful surgery. Dr Chandrashekar then recommended me to a physiotherapist -- after a couple of months of physio sessions, i was able to get almost complete range of motion in my hand, thus exceeding the expectations of even the surgeon! I have now started my strengthening exercises, and apart from some stiffness, which is expected, am able to use my right hand for all my work.

I would say, given the nature and complexity of my injury, along with the fact that it was my right hand that got injured, i am greatly indebted to my surgeon who saved me from a major handicap for the rest of my life. In spite of being a pretty busy doctor, i could always get his time for all my subsequent check-ups. He would listen to all my queries patiently, and answer them to my satisfaction. Another point that i would like to make is that he would also reply to my queries that i would text him over the phone. He would get back without fail!

Dear Doctor Chandra Sekhar,
Miracles are not happening in heaven but in your hands Magic is not happening in the shows but from your heart Wonders are not happening in the world but from you.

A right blend of humanity, professionalism, empathy, kindness and power to save others can be there with very few on this earth and you are one among them.
May god give you lot of power to save many more.

Before meeting him, I got a consultation for my mom in the other two hospitals basically for her Knee replacement and her age is 71. As soon as we had a consultation at Sakra, by seeing her Xray, Doctor explained the condition. So we decided the date for her surgery on March 16th,2020. Luckily my mom never had any health issues except Knee's problem. Her both Knee replacement was done on the same day by Dr Chandrashekar. Everything went well and I met my mom in the recovery room soon after her surgery. I never felt bad about doing any small paperwork or running around because I was pretty sure and happy that approached the right doctor after doing some research. Doctor visited my mom every day and his humbleness, caring and talking to patient's family members with ease was so amazing. That boosted up my confidence level so much even after the surgery that my mom will recover soon. The team worked so well, and she was discharged just a day before the lockdown. I have to truly talk about the Physiotherapist Aneesh, who came to my home like a God. He underwent so much trouble during the initial lockdown time because police were not letting him come due to COVID . with all the hurdles, he makes sure visiting my mother everyday.Such a young and energetic person ,well suited for this profession with full of kindness.  His advice and exercise made my mom to feel better and better. After 2 weeks, Dr Renganath came home with another person to remove my mom‚Äôs sutures. This is something unbelievable and amazing support provided by the team and hospital. They said due to Covid, don‚Äôt bring the patient to hospital, we will come home to remove the suture. I never ever heard such support from any hospital in my lifetime. Truly amazing doctor, support and service . Now my mother is able to walk normally , she can sit comfortable, able to claim stairs and back to her routine lifestyle. I am thankful to god that I went to the right place for the surgery. I simply recommend anyone have the knee problem, pls visit Dr Chandrashekar P.

I took  my mom 2 weeks ago to see an Xray , and everything was perfect and doctor said she will not have problem for another 20 years.

Various doctors  suggested for the knee replacement surgery. She was not ready for it. For the last 2-3 years she started using stick while walking. It was extremely painful for her while going up or coming down using stairs.
We went to consult the Dr. Chandrashekar, after looking at the reports, she explains the situation and convinced my mom for surgery. He was so well in explaining the current issue, future problems which may come and how to resolve it. His personal involvement with patients makes the difference.
She was convinced and we admitted her for the surgery. It was around 10 days she was in hospital. She started walking after a month. Now, she is improving every day. Her quality of life is really improved.
I would like to thank Dr. Chandrashekar and his team specially Dr. Ranga who was always available over phone, whatsapp, messages to help. I am really touched by the team.
