But he did x-ray in that nothing came but still he charged 800 Rs. for x-ray and given medicine which was pain killers for around 800. He never told me before about pain killers. Again i visited after 10 days again he given me pain killers for 10 days and charged consultation. Then he suggested for MRI. I did MRI and went to him again he charged consultation. After seeing my MRI he told me to go for surgery and recommended one hospital where he was visiting. He started asking me about insurance plan. thank god i left him and went to another doctor who told me after seeing my MRI that you don't need to go for surgery at all. do some rest and exercises and you will be fine. It's more than a month and my pain has been reduced by almost 90% without taking  a single medicine. \n\nPlease show some human dignity and don't be so inhman with patient.  Don't be rud to your patient. And tell to learn some manner to your staff. I am really disappointed by visitng there. \n\nPlease i tell everyone not to visit here if you want to save your mony and health. Go to any other places.",

But he did x-ray in that nothing came but still he charged 800 Rs. for x-ray and given medicine which was pain killers for around 800. He never told me before about pain killers. Again i visited after 10 days again he given me pain killers for 10 days and charged consultation. Then he suggested for MRI. I did MRI and went to him again he charged consultation. After seeing my MRI he told me to go for surgery and recommended one hospital where he was visiting. He started asking me about insurance plan. thank god i left him and went to another doctor who told me after seeing my MRI that you don't need to go for surgery at all. do some rest and exercises and you will be fine. It's more than a month and my pain has been reduced by almost 90% without taking  a single medicine. \n\nPlease show some human dignity and don't be so inhman with patient.  Don't be rud to your patient. And tell to learn some manner to your staff. I am really disappointed by visitng there. \n\nPlease i tell everyone not to visit here if you want to save your mony and health. Go to any other places.",

Treatment wise I am not satisfied. Medicine was prescribed by doctor for 3 weeks, but there was improvement in health. Dr. Madan told me to go for a laser surgery which costs Rs 7000 - 8000. I was not convinced about laser surgery. I didn't want to go for surgery. My son had liquid that comes out from joint. They are giving medicines of their own.

Great maturity is needed to have  clarity in mind that Doctor has given his complete attention, time and resources in a Teleconsultation before giving appropriate advice. Fee has been charged for the service already given. When the same person chooses physical consultation, Doctor is again giving his complete time & attention for physical examination, apply his resources and answer all the doubts by patient and relative. Hence it is not right to expect teleconsultation fee already paid to cover the new services sought in the form of physical consultation. It is felt that we were not wrong in charging Fee for Physical Consultation. However it is a different matter that the type of mature understanding we expect is not available in our Society, as Teleconsultation is an evolving concept in our Country.\nIt is not less than any defamation or harassment directed to us unnecessarily, to receive a false allegation while simultaneously suffering revenue loss as the Physical Consultation stands not paid by the Patient till today.\nDr.madan ",

Doctor refused to state this problem & precaution to be taken i.e. bed rest in the medical prescription/certificate, and rudely says that \"get back to your work\" when I asked for medical certificate. He simply doesn't understand the patient's problem although he's well aware that I've difficulty sitting for 1 hour with straight neck posture (straight neck posture is also leading to nerves pinching).

One can realise the response of patient to pain only after Injection is given and no technology as on today can predict a patient response before Injection is given.\nOne can always refuse an injection. It is only in infants & kids that injection is given forcefully by restraining the child and not at all in adults who can speak. It appears to be an emotional outburst and a frivolous matter.",
