I am writing to express my Heartfelt Appreciation and deepest gratitude for the exceptional care and skill you provided during my mother's recent knee surgery. Your expertise and dedication have played a pivotal role in her successful recovery.

From our initial consultation to the post-operative follow-ups, your professionalism, empathy, and clear communication have been truly commendable. Your ability to explain the intricacies of the surgery in a way that was easily understandable to us, coupled with your reassuring demeanor, alleviated our concerns and instilled confidence in the entire process.

It is with immense appreciation that I acknowledge the precision and care with which you performed the surgery. The success of the procedure has not only granted my mother relief from the persistent knee pain she experienced but has also allowed her to regain her mobility and independence. Witnessing her swift recovery has been a source of great joy and reassurance for our entire family.

Furthermore, your genuine concern for my mother's well-being, both pre and post-surgery, has not gone unnoticed. Your attentiveness to her needs and your willingness to address any questions or concerns have made a significant impact on the overall positive experience we had under your care.

In a field where compassion and competence are paramount, you have exemplified the qualities that make a truly exceptional healthcare professional. Your dedication to your patients' well-being is evident, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had you as our mother's surgeon.

Please accept our heartfelt thanks for your invaluable contribution to her recovery. Your commitment to excellence has made a lasting impression on our family, and we will forever be grateful for the positive impact you have had on my mother's life.

Wishing you continued success in your medical career and expressing our deepest appreciation once again.

We did consult doctors in the past and had discussed about it including options of going for a surgery. However, we kept on postponing it. The last dislocation for me happened in August 2021 and it was quite severe. This is the time we had an opportunity to consult Dr. Sai Krishna B Naidu (Orthopedist, Sparsh Hospital, Yeshwanthpur, Bangalore). He examined me thoroughly and suggested a MRI. After analyzing the report, he explained us in detail the situation and status of my shoulder joint. I was diagnosed to have left shoulder Anteroinferior Bankart’s lesion + Hill Sachs lesion. Dr. Sai Krishna recommended to go for Arthroscopy of Shoulder. He explained us clearly about the course of treatment and its benefits and gave us the confidence. We were very convinced and clear; and decided to go for the Shoulder Arthroscopy. Dr. Sai Krishna and his team did a fantastic job and the surgery was very successful. After all my sessions of Physiotherapy now I am very comfortable, relieved and glad. Dr. Sai Krishna is very friendly and approachable. He listens to all our queries patiently and answers them! He is very caring.
After having done the Arthroscopy, now I feel that I took a great decision to go for it; and of course, I was very fortunate to have Dr. Sai Krishna doing it. We are very thankful to him.
Based on my extremely good experience, I would recommend going for Arthroscopy for anyone with similar problems with shoulder without prolonging it.
