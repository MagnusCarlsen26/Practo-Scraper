I am glad to say that I am immensely satisfied with the results and I would like to share my experience for the benefit of others.\nWhen I first consulted Dr. Balamurali Krishnan in December 2021, I had two major issues. Chronic arthritic pain and my right leg was shorter than the left leg, forcing me to limp. My first impression was that I had come to the right person for treatment. Dr. Balamurali Krishnan patiently explained the issues I was having, the procedure he would be performing (if I decide to go ahead with surgery) and what outcome to expect. He was very realistic about the outcome. \n\nAfter surgery, the arthritic pain is totally gone, and the shortening is very minimal, For the 1st time in many years, I am able to walk without a limp.  I would like to thank Dr. Balamurali Krishnan for the excellent work that he has done. I also would like to thank his team members, Dr. Deepak, Dr. Rohit, Dr. Idris, Dr Razi and the hospital support staff. They were very friendly and very easy to approach with any queries and concerns throughout the treatment period. A good team indeed. \n\nFinally, about the hospital, the overall service and infrastructure were top class\nI would definitely recommend Dr Bala & his team \n\nRavishankar",

He used a model of a knee joint to explain my condition, showed me the specific problematic regions in the MRI and explained what they meant. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. All my questions were answered at length and with great care. I came out of his clinic with complete knowledge of my injury and the various treatment options available. I feel very confident that I have all the information i need to take the right course of action. I would definitely recommend him to my family and friends. ",

Any patient has right to understand the treatment and its pros and cons. Fourth he said that patients kill his hours. Mr. Krishnan is completely unprofessional, impatient, two faced doctor. He is not trust worthy and said this line - \"Pain after or before procedure is not my problem, I just do surgery \". Hope this helps people who go to him with all the hope and pay hefty amount for his consultation ***** ** ***** *** ** ******* *** ** **** ** **** ***** ** ****** ******** ***** ******** ** ***** As patients you require solution and that was not at all given by doctor.",

He is a very charismatic and expert doctor. His patience, confidence, explanation, experience, and expertise is something which will make you recover better and quicker. I am very much grateful to him and thank him for everything. Unable to visit due to the Covid-19 situation. Will definitely visit him once things are back to normal again.

I was asked to continue playing during the treatment time which increased my problem.Finally, I stopped visiting there as the last opinion given to me was to be positive but no root cause was given for my pain. This was very shocking and I decided to take a second opinion anywhere but here. And finally I came to know that I am suffering from a knee injury, that is, patellar tendonitis and I was asked to take rest and complete medication was done in just 10-15% of the total amount which I spent in Columbia Asia.Note: I got my treatment done somewhere else and not in Columbia Asia.Also, I am writing this feedback very late as I visited to the doctor in early 2018 this year.",

I am glad to say that I am immensely satisfied with the results and I would like to share my experience for the benefit of others.\nWhen I first consulted Dr. Balamurali Krishnan in December 2021, I had two major issues. Chronic arthritic pain and my right leg was shorter than the left leg, forcing me to limp. My first impression was that I had come to the right person for treatment. Dr. Balamurali Krishnan patiently explained the issues I was having, the procedure he would be performing (if I decide to go ahead with surgery) and what outcome to expect. He was very realistic about the outcome. \n\nAfter surgery, the arthritic pain is totally gone, and the shortening is very minimal, For the 1st time in many years, I am able to walk without a limp.  I would like to thank Dr. Balamurali Krishnan for the excellent work that he has done. I also would like to thank his team members, Dr. Deepak, Dr. Rohit, Dr. Idris, Dr Razi and the hospital support staff. They were very friendly and very easy to approach with any queries and concerns throughout the treatment period. A good team indeed. \n\nFinally, about the hospital, the overall service and infrastructure were top class\nI would definitely recommend Dr Bala & his team \n\nRavishankar",

He was very methodical and took plenty of time to explain every detail related to my Injury. He used a model of a knee joint to explain my condition, showed me the specific problematic regions in the MRI and explained what they meant. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. All my questions were answered at length and with great care. I came out of his clinic with complete knowledge of my injury and the various treatment options available. I feel very confident that I have all the information i need to take the right course of action. I would definitely recommend him to my family and friends. ",

Any patient has right to understand the treatment and its pros and cons. Fourth he said that patients kill his hours. Mr. Krishnan is completely unprofessional, impatient, two faced doctor.

He is a very charismatic and expert doctor. His patience, confidence, explanation, experience, and expertise is something which will make you recover better and quicker. I am very much grateful to him and thank him for everything. Unable to visit due to the Covid-19 situation. Will definitely visit him once things are back to normal again.

All kind of tests were done and still after everything nothing was diagnosed after spending lot of money in multiple tests. I was asked to continue playing during the treatment time which increased my problem.Finally, I stopped visiting there as the last opinion given to me was to be positive but no root cause was given for my pain. This was very shocking and I decided to take a second opinion anywhere but here. And finally I came to know that I am suffering from a knee injury, that is, patellar tendonitis and I was asked to take rest and complete medication was done in just 10-15% of the total amount which I spent in Columbia Asia.Note: I got my treatment done somewhere else and not in Columbia Asia.Also, I am writing this feedback very late as I visited to the doctor in early 2018 this year.",
