"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr Anil Patil for treatment of my Mother-in-law's Knee issue.
Dr. Anil as a Consultant: Dr Anil was very quick to check and get the basic tests done and advise the treatment required and treatment plan.
His swiftness to assess the issue and give confidence the patient and  their family of the treatment required and how it benefits etc is really good.
Dr Anil makes sure that he explains the situation in a way that even a layman can understand. This really helps the patient and their family  to ask more questions and understand better. This environment for open discussion eases a lot of inhibitions.

Dr. Anil as a Surgeon: I must say he is gifted with good hands that do wonders . My mother-in Law's bilateral TKR  is a testimony of this. she could not thanks Dr. Anil enough for making her quality of life better where she had lost all hopes. We are happy that we choose Dr Anil as our health care provider.

Sparsh Hospital: Dr Anil asked us to get admitted  at Sparh Hospital at Yashwanhpur and gave a contact of Sheethal for completing  the insurance pre-auth formalities. Sheethal got this authorization very quickly and advised us the date of admission. on the day of admission, I was very scared  as I saw a room full of customers discussing various issue at the billing department. I thought, I will have to go through this ordeal to have my bills settled even though I had complete per-authorization from my insurer.
This is where Sheethal come in and helps me right with the admission process to discharge. I am glad that I had Sheethal by my side who took utmost care of the queries,  issues/ concerns that we had. Her calm approach makes it very pleasant experience at the hospital and my initial impressions were totally ironed out.

I am happy to say that my experience has been overwhelmingly positive with him. He devoted sufficient time for listening to me, doing the examination/assessment and  finally explaining everything to me in a way that I could understand. Based on this interaction I opted to undergo surgery as per his recommendation.

One thing I found especially remarkable was the accuracy of his assessment... Other doctors told me that I had ACL & MCL damage while he said that I had actually suffered MPFL damage after examining me in the same manner. This was later confirmed by the MRI scan. He also explained in detail the different levels of surgical intervention open to me (due to some issue with my bone structure), the risks associated with each option and left the decision making to me without forcing anything upon me.  

The surgery went off exactly like he said. He has been extremely approachable and supportive post surgery, constantly follows up on my progress and takes time to clarify even the smallest doubts that I have. It has been 8 weeks since my surgery and my rehabilitation has been progressing smoothly and as I had hoped.
