Please don’t spread misinformation/hatred

You came to me with pain in foot which started after walking barefoot in temple premises one month ago. You came on around 5:30pm my consultation ends at 6 pm at this clinic 

I explained that there is foreign  object pierced in to foot and explained about why X-ray needs to be done -there was a foreign object pierced in to your foot 1 month ago to know if it is a metal piece or thorn (it could cause septicaemia which is infection) so I asked for an X-ray. You can cross check with other doctors if it’s a routine process to get an X-ray -that’s called practicing evidence based medicine 

If you didn’t like the reasoning you shouldn’t have not got the X-ray done.  I did not say real estate /rents are high and you have to bear the cost of X-ray . 

Also I told you that because of high patient load it’s not possible to do procedure on same day which needs to cut the part of foot extract the foreign object and stitch the skin  back. It requires some time you came at 5:30 knowing my consultation time is only till 6 pm and demanded me to do it.

Still I took you to my fellow colleague and requested him to do the procedure and transferred the consultation to that doctor, only after asking you if that’s ok for you to get it done by another doctor. As I was leaving to another hospital where there were pre booked appointments. You have waited for one whole month with out any treatment and wanted the procedure to be done on emergency basis. So you got it removed by our doctor here

Before I left When you asked about charges for procedure to cut and extract the foreign object for foot I told it will be around 3000 rupees which you said very high and why is it so - even though I do not charge you directly - apollo clinic decides charges. It was my mistake to say health care expenses  and costs in Bangalore went up these days due to various reasons like rents. If you thought it is expensive you should have got it done in a different place where they charge lesser but you went ahead and got it removed here by my colleague whom i recommended. Technically you were not treated by me at all. And I didn’t charge you a rupee also, you trying to spread misinformation on social platforms. 

I didn’t want to reply for your feed back but still did because there should be other side of the story.
