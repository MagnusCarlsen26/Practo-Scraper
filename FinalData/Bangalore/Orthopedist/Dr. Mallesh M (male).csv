My brother was in complete pain and unable to rotate his legs and not even allowing anyone to touch his ankle joints, we got the x-rays in nearby diagnostic centre and rushed to his clinic. He didn’t suggest any unwanted additional Scan’s and instead he examined thoroughly and conducted couple of movement test and shared his observations in very understandable manner for common man. 
There are only few doctors, who speak transparently with patients and make them feel comfortable, patients will start feeling that they are already half cured.  I would highly recommend Dr.Mallesh for any ortho related issues...Thank you.",2023-06-07 04:43:36,False,True,Malavika,,,
