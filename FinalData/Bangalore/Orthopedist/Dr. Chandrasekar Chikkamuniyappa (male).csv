"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"Good Part:
Doctors are good and experienced. They gave ample time to understand the symptoms and what I had to say. They explained in detail causes and possible issues. X ray dept was good and gave me X ray report within 20-30 mins.

Bad Part:
1. They charge Rs 50 for registration details. This is wrong because registration of patient is done so that hospital can have a centralized information/Database. Now it's totally wrong for them to charge patient for this as it's to improve hospital processes.
2. Waiting: My appointment was at 12 noon and I met the doctor at 1:20 pm, that is waiting time of approx 90 mins on working day. 
3. Hospital needs to improve the customer handling big time as these delays are not acceptable. Need to have better processes and patiently needs to be exactly told where next department is and what is the next process, patient shouldn't be left to wonder about the next steps.
