"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,the experience once you meet the doctor is good . he takes time to review the case and explains things in detail .but the major problem is the wait time even after taking an appointment . This was my fourth visit and evey single time wait time has been minimum of 1.5 hours . The strange part is they feel no obligation to explain the reason for delay and that it is considered normal to keep patients waiting for 1.5-2 hours . never understood what's the point of giving an appointment when ultimately you guys have no respect for time slots and feel it's normal to make people wait for long periods . ,2020-01-21 03:24:04,False,True,Arun Sreenivasan,,,

I had an appointment on Saturday. Got a call from clinic a day before to tell me the appointment is cancelled. I asked for a reschedule, so got appointment of Friday. Was not in favour but meeting doc was important. Had to take one half leave from office to reach clinic.  

After reaching I was told to wait atleast an hour. Or take an appointment on Saturday. Remember they had cancelled my appointment on Saturday earlier. 

I told that I can't come again. So I ll wait. As there were no seat vacant. I went out. Soon I got a seat and sat there for around 1 hour 15 mins. After which I enquired again. 

The receptionist had not queued me. Thinking that I ve left. And hence had to wait more. 

The staff their are not at all courteous and will always be in hurry. This being a doctor's clinic atleast patient expect to be heard.  Atleast treat people as people and not animal. 

I met doc after  2 hours of waiting. 

Doctor is very good. But this clinic is extremely bad.
