"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",,0,0,YES,the experience once you meet the doctor is good . he takes time to review the case and explains things in detail .but the major problem is the wait time even after taking an appointment . This was my fourth visit and evey single time wait time has been minimum of 1.5 hours . The strange part is they feel no obligation to explain the reason for delay and that it is considered normal to keep patients waiting for 1.5-2 hours . never understood what's the point of giving an appointment when ultimately you guys have no respect for time slots and feel it's normal to make people wait for long periods . ,2020-01-21 03:24:04,False,True,Arun Sreenivasan,,,
,,0,0,Yes,"I'm consulting him from more than two months. Until now everything is well and fine. The doctor is spontaneously taking care of my medical needs. I'm satisfied with the treatment. The consultation will take a while though. In case if the queue is long, it might cross more than an hour. But not being very bothered about that, I am happy to recommend the doctor.",2020-04-06 13:21:15,False,True,Sumita satpathy,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I visited doctor in June 2023 for second opinion. As I required surgery for complex fracture. Due to short notice, I had to do a walk-in. The staff made me wait 6.5 hours to get the consult.

If this is not extreme of mismanagement then what is. They refuse to acknowledge urgency. They cannot say what is potential wait time.
Manipal should review the setup.

Upon meeting doctor, he completed consult in 2 mins with surgery is required and he can do it only tomorrow and cannot tell other slots available.
He didn’t care to explain what is actual details of surgery and options. Just showed a picture.
Upon reaching hospital that night , I was told ONLY general ward is available. This I returned and started to look for another doctors and hospital.
This episode has left me with bad feeling about Manipal management.",2023-06-28 02:36:33,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
