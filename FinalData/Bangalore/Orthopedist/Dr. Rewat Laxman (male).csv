I visited this doctor when my mother met with bus accident and her spine L2 got fractured. I met many doctors in case of my mother but all doctors gave me clear reply to have a spine surgery done . I was very confused where to get the surgery done. 
After some time my one friend suggested me that you should meet to Dr. Revat (Apollo spectra hospital)
So I met to this doctor. He said that he could perform the spine surgery.
I got the surgery date within one week and after the surgery was done my mother recovered within one month of time and she started walking again.
We were very happy with the kind of treatment she received from the doctor as well as all the staffs from the hospital. All the staff members were so kind and we did not feel like we were in a hospital. Hospital atmosphere feels like home .
