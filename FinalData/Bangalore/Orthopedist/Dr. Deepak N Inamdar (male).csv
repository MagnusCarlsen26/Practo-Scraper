"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"We have Dr. Inamdar to thank for 2 separate occasions. Ten years ago, he operated on my sister for a benign cyst in her left heel. This was a very unusual case and my sister was suffering from intense pain. Sir was very systematic and performed bone grafting, filling in the cavity with bone fragments from her pelvic bone. Later xrays made it apparent that sir had done a fantastic job and no one would believe there ever was any cyst.That's why we went to sir again, this time for our mother's knee problems. Mom had fallen on one knee and had torn her ligaments. But she always suffered from intense knee pain. Mom was stubborn and didn't want to go through surgery, but with the careful analysis sir gave her, she saw reason. We were concerned since mom is obese and has high blood pressure but we didn't need to worry because she was in the best of hands. She was admitted to Apollo Jayanagar, where sir performed total knee replacement. The left knee was operated on Jan 3, and the right on Jan 6. Now, a month later, mom is walking well without any support. She even takes short strolls in the apartment park and she can climb up and down a single flight of stairs. In the months to come, we are sure that her progress will continue to be phenomenal.Sir's meticulous work is really inspiring. I have recommended him to several friends and colleagues and we will continue to visit him for all orthopaedic cases. He cares and explains everything so that everyone understand the healing process and the factors involved in the surgery.We are truly grateful for his support and advice.If you are considering any orthopedic related procedures, please contact him *** *** **** ******* *** **** **********",2020-02-15 02:26:55,False,True,Mr. VINAY KEERTHI,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee replacement,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Deepak Inamdar performed TKR on both the knees of my mother about a year back. My mother is really happy and healthy post the operation and is now able to walk for 30 min without stopping and able to perform all her daily chores independently.

My mother, aged about 65 years, was almost bed ridden and was not even able to move even with walkers. Her life was miserable.
She was scared of the very thought of knee operation esp. when some of her friends shared stories of pain, swelling post operation and during physiotherapy.

That is when we met Dr. Deepak Inamdar in Jayanagar. He did diagnosis and explained the benefits of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. He asked us to do couple of test to determine the suitability of operation. Based on test, he recommended couple of medications and asked to do some leg exercises while sitting down as prep for surgery. My mother’s all muscles were all gone and has no strength.

Doctor fixed the operation after 10 days and performed TKR on both knees within gap of 3 days. Total hospital time of 10 days and post that my mother was back on her feet. He recommended physiotherapy sessions which started from day 2 itself and continued for a month, post sutures removal. Doctor started making her walk from day 2 itself and within 15 days from operation, my mother was able to walk (slowly) without any support.

Pain management was excellent she never felt any pain thorough out the hospital stay and post that during physiotherapy. All our myths were dispelled and my mother was really surprised that how she went thru all of this with help of Dr. Inamdar.

I would also like to share that we were happy to see that doctor would always visit the patient and talk so cheerfully, encourage for the future and answer any questions/doubts we have. He even came to see the patient on the day of bangalore bandh esp. when I did not see any other doctor visiting their patients on that day. Kudos !

I would strongly recommend Dr.Deepak Inamdar if someone is planning to undergo Knee Replacement. The physiotherapy plan was also well designed to suit his age and condition.
