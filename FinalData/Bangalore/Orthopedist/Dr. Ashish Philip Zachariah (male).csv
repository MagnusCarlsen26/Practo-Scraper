None,None,0,0,YES,"I was treated by Dr. Ashish Philip for ankle pain due to a bone protrusion about two years ago. He was very clear about his treatment plan and allayed all my fears of surgery. The whole surgery and hospitalization was pain-free and smooth process. By god's grace and his exceptional care my pain was gone and I am extremely comfortable today going about all my regular activities. 
Recently I had a spine fracture due to a fall and I turned to Dr.Ashish for treatment.  It has been 6 weeks and I am much better now. Thank you so much Doctor.God bless you.",2021-06-24 12:15:21,False,True,Sherly Stephen,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"I have consulted Dr. Ashish several times and he has always provided easy to follow practical advise. He doesnt believe in unneccesary tests, gives you his undivided attention and the best part is that he would take the time to patiently explain what is causing the problem. Further he provides a treatment action plan and roadmap with clear timelines. You know you are in safe hands because he is upfront and straight forward. I have been treated by him for multiple sports injuries and each time I have recovered in 2-3 weeks following his advise. ********** *** ** *** *** ***** ******* ** *****  Thank you Dr. Ashish.

None,None,0,0,YES,"I met Dr. Ashish after suffering from coccyx pain for ~1.5 years, after meeting several doctors & after undergoing several tests, with no meaningful results. It was becoming chronic & I was losing hopes of being able to manage the pain. 

Dr. Ashish empathised with my situation, understood the difficulties I was going through & over a month, diagnosed my pain as Ischial Tuberosity Bursitis by exclusion.

He has been treating me since & my condition has improved a lot. Ever grateful to Dr Ashish for his help in diagnosis, treatment & counselling.",2021-06-27 05:42:34,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Ashish Philip Zachariah is a thorough professional and one of the rare doctors who makes you feel at ease as soon as you meet him. A friend more than a doctor. He will patiently listen to all your symptoms & complaints and advice the best course of action. When I had fractured my wrist, he brought a sense of calm to my rather painful situation and continuously followed up on my progress which I haven't seen much from other doctors but very few. I will always urge everyone to reach out to Dr. Ashish as he is the best at what he does without a doubt. Wishing you all the very best Dr. Ashish & thank you once again for everything.
