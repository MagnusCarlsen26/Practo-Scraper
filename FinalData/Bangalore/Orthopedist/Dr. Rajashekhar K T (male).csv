"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I had been suffering pain in both my knees for nearly a decade. Let alone walk, even standing for a few seconds was excruciatingly difficult. The fear of pain and the lack of clarity on the recovery after surgery made me postpone taking any action for relief till now. Also, I did not know how to decide on the surgeon whom I could trust and be rest assured that I would be able to walk again without pain.

After a lot of research and asking around, I met Dr. Rajasekhar K T at Fortis, BG Road. That single meeting was enough for me to be convinced that I am in good hands. X-rays and other diagnosis had revealed that though both my knees required surgery, the damage in the left one was quite intense. 

I went ahead with the the joint replacement surgery of both my knees with a gap of 4 days between the two. Apparently, the surgery in the left knee was a very difficult one, as was described by several doctors present during the surgery. However, on both the days of the surgeries, I could walk a few steps on the day itself. I was in the hospital for a total of 9 days. Although there was post-operative pain and discomfort, I was very well taken care of. 

It has been over a month now. My stitches came off after 15 days of the surgeries. I am continuing with physiotherapy and diet control and I am experiencing a noticeable difference in my mobility. Even after I was back home, any time I had a query or a concern, Dr Rajashekhar was always there, just a whatsapp message away.This was a huge support as any new development would make me worried. He would reassure me and prescribe medicines if any was required.   

If you are suffering because of damaged knees, I highly recommend that you must consult an orthopedic surgeon immediately and if you are in Bangalore, based on my experience I can say quite definitively that you need not look anywhere beyond Dr. Rajashekhar K T.

I am sharing the feedback on behalf of my father, Asoke Goswami, his age is 69 years. My father has been suffering from knee pain for the last 12 years. Though we have taken consultation from an Orthopedic surgeon 12 years back and knee replacement operation has been proposed because of Osteoarthritis. My father was not ready for a knee replacement operation till Feb’22. His conception was that he may not walk properly after his operation because of his old age. He was using painkillers medicine very frequently without informing us. On Feb '22, his pain was intolerable and the painkiller medicine was not working as per expectation. That’s why we decided on the operation.
We are extremely fortunate that we are able to manage an appointment with Dr. Rajashekhar K T who is a specialist in Knee Replacement Surgery at Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore Fortis Hospital. The doctor operated on my father’s both legs with a single hospitalization duration of 8 days, though my father is having complications like Blood Sugar, High Blood Pressure, Kidney & Prostate Issue. I am literally happy to see my father that within 45 days after the operation, my father is walking 2 KM/DAY without any support. He did not feel any pain. The medicine stooped almost 15 days back. I can say we got the best treatment in Bangalore from a world-class doctor with a class -1 hospital within my budget with a limited timeline.
We are thankful to the doctor Rajashekhar K T that he has given a new life to my father in his 69 years of age where my father can walk properly without any support without any pain.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I recently got both my joints replaced by Dr Rajasekhar at Fortis hospital. The experience I had during the process made me write this review.  I have been suffering from joint pain for the past 5 years as during this time I have spoken to many doctors about the joint replacement surgery. But I never got enough confidence to get the surgery done. One of my close friends referred Dr. Rajasekhar to me and mentioned his immense experience in this field.
Dr.Rajasekhar was kind enough to spend extra time patiently answering all my concerns and worries about the surgery and talking to him gave me enough confidence to undergo the surgery and I got both the joints replaced recently. Even during the surgery, he made sure I am comfortable and that I was not feeling any anxiety. After the surgery, his care team was also available at all times to answer any questions. I would definitely recommend Dr.Rajasekhar at Fortis hospital. Thank you Sir!
