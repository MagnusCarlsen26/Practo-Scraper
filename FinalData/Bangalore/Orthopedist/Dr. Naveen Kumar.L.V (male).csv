"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Foot & Ankle,",0,0,NO,"Visited the clinic almost 3 weeks back with my mother. She had pain and swelling in ankle due to arthritis and I had pain in heel (bottom part) due to spur/plantar fasciitis.  Though the explanation of the issue and examination by the assistant doctor was good, but there was no outcome of it. They are just forwarding a set of exercises to everyone irrespective of age and severity, whether they are 75 years old or 30 years old!!! My mother did the exercises for 2 days and her swelling and pain increased, she got swelling at the back of the ankle also, ******* *** *** **** ** *** ***** *** ***** **** ******** ** *** ***** ***** For myself, I continued doing the exercises exactly in the way they had told, but after 10 days or so, I also developed pain at the back of the ankle, and the heel pain is still there.  I had come here with lot of hope after looking at doctor's qualification and reading the reviews, in fact waited for 3,4 days to show him only since he was out of station, but it was of no use.  Looks like they are interested only in problems related to bones, for pains they are just handing over exercises and sending away.",2024-02-02 02:21:27,False,False,Verified Patient,"Thanks for the review! Firstly, we need to note that the patient had advanced arthritis of the ankle.  This was clearly explained. At her age, with other medical problems, we did not want to suggest an ankle replacement surgery for her. Pain medications are not a long term solutions for this. As the patient had stiffness of the smaller joints of the foot as well, it was recommended that she does some simple stretches to keep the foot muscles supple. These are generic exercises and do suit for all age groups. It was clearly explained to the patient and family that these exercises will take 4 to 6 weeks of regularity before one can expect improvement. As the family had concerns, I had personally phoned them and discussed these issues. Inspite of that, when people expect long standing issues to get better within 10 days or 3 weeks, I am at loss for words. Fortunately, vast majority of our patients are not looking for a list of medications to be prescribed, but are ready to do the exercises for long enough period. For people who struggle to do the exercises themselves, there is always an option of taking help from physiotherapists, but that would mean one needs to be ready to shell out 15 to 20K for physio sessions. 
We do understand that people come to us with lot of hope. But patients need to understand that there is a difference between a sorcerer (Baba) and a Doctor and need the patience to go through the treatment and return back to clinic for review when necessary.
Lastly, yes we do have generic list of exercises for a lot of orthopedic conditions. Sometimes, the same list of exercises may be applicable to two different conditions. They work for most patients provided they stick to it!

Since after my POP was removed the lockdown was there, so whatever doctor suggested exercises I followed those. And in 3 months, my hand became normal and i started all my daily activities.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Pain Treatment,Neck Pain Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Naveen has been treating me for neck and shoulder pain since a year.

During this month, I consulted him 3 days after accidentally injuring both of my knees. He had observed my knee bruises and swelling, diagnosed accurately and suggested a X-ray for both knees. As it was evident from X-ray that there was no fracture, he had provided me medication, knee cap and had advised to take complete rest for a week. 

Furthermore, in the next consultation, he examined my leg movements and diagnosed that my right knee wasn’t improving as much as the left knee. My MRI of the right knee indicated insertional tendinosis involving distal quadriceps tendon, which Dr. Naveen is treating me perfectly with the equipment I need such as ROM knee brace, abundant rest and simple exercises.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Total Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I am writing this review to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. for performing a successful total knee replacement surgery on my mother, who has been suffering from serious osteoarthritis for the last 3-4 years. Her knee pain had become so unbearable that she could barely walk. Initially, she was hesitant to undergo surgery due to the fear and skepticism surrounding it. However, after much persuasion, we finally convinced her to see Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V.

Before the surgery, I had consulted with a few knee specialists and orthopedics in Bangalore based on Google and Practo reviews. However, my experience with them was quite disappointing. They seemed more focused on promoting their services rather than advising us on the best course of action. It was only after meeting with Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. that we felt reassured.

Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. was very patient and understanding. He listened to our concerns and suggested the best options available for my mother's condition. He did not rush us into making a decision, but instead gave us a week to think it over. He even spoke to my mother personally, explaining the procedure and reassuring her that everything would be alright. His kindness and compassion towards his patients are truly admirable.

The surgery was a success, but the road to recovery was not easy. My mother was in a lot of pain for the first week. However, Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. made sure to visit her every day and help her with simple exercises. He was very attentive and reassuring, which made all the difference. Two months after the surgery, my mother is now able to walk comfortably without a stick. We are all delighted to see her progress and feel grateful to Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. for making it possible.

In conclusion, Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. is not just a brilliant doctor, but also a kind and compassionate human being who deeply cares about his patients. His professionalism, expertise, and kindness have left a lasting impression on me and my family. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a trustworthy and reliable orthopedic surgeon.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Knee Pain Treatment,",0,0,YES,"About a month ago, I had visited Dr. Naveen's clinic in order to accompany my mother for her knee pain issue.
My mother had an enormous pain in her right knee from a few weeks and due to a road journey, her pain had deteriorated. 
During the consultation, Dr. Naveen had observed her knee movements cautiously and recommended an X-ray for in-depth analysis. The young girl who performs the X-ray is one of the kindest staffs in the clinic, who had made my mom very comfortable in the process because of her immense pain while bending or stretching the knee.
Furthermore, Doctor had examined the X-ray and provided a detailed summary of the report that the X-ray doesn't potray a serious injury or a fracture. Hence, a step-by-step diagnosis, medication and treatment path was provided to my mom along with the exercise leaflets, which are self-explanatory. At present, my mom's knee pain has decreased to a greater extent.

Also, last year my mom had visited Dr. Naveen since she had excruciating pain in her left hand near the thumb, which had lasted for almost 2 months. During the consultation, doctor closely observed and accurately diagnosed this condition as De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Consequently, my mom had decided to take the injection as suggested by the doctor, which was extremely painful momentarily. However, within few days, her condition and pain had reduced evidently and she followed the treatment path, exercises provided by the doctor. Over the next few weeks, the pain had completely subsided. Thanks to Dr. Naveen for everything so far and kudos to his excellence, precision, presence of mind and so on. God bless!

No patient would appreciate any Doctor picking up the phone calls in the middle of their consultation.

When running full clinics every day, it is humanly impossible for me to attend to telephone calls. I wish there were more than 24 hours in a day! 
Inspite of this, I have spoken to you once on phone already 4 days post first consultation. When you expected second phone call 8 days later, you were offered a free follow-up appointment. As you didn't want to opt for it, you were told to drop the mail. Infact, you received a prompt answer to that mail as well. Moreover, regarding your medical condition, we had a clear discussion that it will take atleast 4 weeks of exercises, and was not going to resolve within in a week. I can definitely make the promise to meet my patient’s needs, but not always meet their expectations!

If all our patients value other people's time as well and arrive on time, and if all our patients present with one problem per consultation and not 3 or 4, and if all our patients refrain from adding on 2nd mini consultation for a family member, then trust me. we will never have a situation where we are struggling with time! But, we live in real world! We will take your suggestions positively and try to improve whatever is in our control. If the pain persists, please make another appointment and we can definitely go through the reason for that try to resolve it.
