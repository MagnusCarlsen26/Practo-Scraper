Yes, you read it right! She had both her knees operated on and on two separate occasions as she did not want both knees to be operated at the same time.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Hip Replacement,",0,0,YES,"Hi Everyone,

Greetings...

I was recommended a Total Hip Replacement Surgery in July 2019, due to some past injury commonly known as AVN (Avascular Necrosis). I had great difficulties walking, sitting, lying down & even travelling. Walking was very embarrassing, coz I had developed a limp gradually without realizing.  I had to quit my work due, in ability to travel.

After consulting several surgeons in Bangalore, I was referred to Dr Sharath in Ramaiah Hospital. He was very kind and offered to consult, though it was not his day for Consultation.

He just went through my X-ray, immediately gave me a date for admission and surgery. And said very confidently, these exact words “I’ll fix it”.

I went through the surgery in Ramaiah Hospital on the 31st of August 2019. And he kept his word, fixed me both physically & mentally. I recovered swiftly, comparatively and doing great since September 2019. I’m back to my regular life and activities, I didn’t go through any kind of post operative pain or stress or physiotherapy just followed up with the recommended out patient consultations and care.

Dr. Sharath K Ramanath in his “Profession is Perfection @ it’s BEST”.

I wish him well with his Future Accomplishments.


Regards
Rabi
