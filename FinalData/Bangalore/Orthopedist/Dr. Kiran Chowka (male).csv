"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Total Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"My mother had been suffering from knee pain in her right leg from the last 2 years and she has been postponing her Char-Dham Religious Trip for the same reason.

He asked her to take some x-rays to check for the latest condition, post which he suggested knee replacement(TKR).
Dr Kiran did not ask to get the surgery done immediately. Instead he gave enough confidence to my mother about the surgery and explained the entire procedure. He also showed some of his patients videos (which included the doctors own mother's post TKR surgery). He assured her that she will be able to complete her Char-dham Religious Trip this year itself and this is when my mother felt confident that she is in safe hands. 
Finally my mother decided to go ahead with the surgery at Apollo Hospital Sheshadripuram where Dr Kiran Chouka is Head of Orthopedic Department. He made sure that everything went smoothly from the time my mother got admitted till the time of discharge. Additionally Dr. Kiran Chouka made some special arrangements to ensure that my mother felt comfortable and the surgery was 100% successful. 
Post surgery my mother was able to walk a few steps on the very next day itself and physiotherapist used to visit twice a day in the Hospital (It is normally once in other hospitals).
Dr Kiran Chouka wanted my mother to walk out of the Hospital on her own right from the beginning and miraculously, with very little support my mother was able to walk out of the hospital on her own.
Going an extra mile, he himself also arranged for a very good skilled physiotherapist to come home everyday for 3 weeks (minimum) and I am already looking forward to the day when my mother will walk without any pain.
Dr Kiran is a genius and extremely passionate towards his work. At such a young age he has excelled in the field of Orthopedics and yet is very down to earth. Dr Kiran does not have the urge to surpass others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at any cost.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"The problem that I had was unique and occurs during heavy lifting in sports. The Bicep tendon was ruptured not in the shoulder (proximal which has a 99% occurrence rate) but at the elbow (distal 1% occurrence). So I know it will be difficult to find a surgeon who has done such a surgery. However, when I met Dr Kiran Chouka, just listening to my symptoms, he was able to diagnosis what the problem was and where the tendon has ruptured. 

He explained me the complete procedure of the surgery, how complex it is, and what things he needs to take care of because of my body built and the type of bones that we Indians have in the elbow. He also said surgery is not necessary if I am are not going to perform certain activities in my day-to-day life.

What I observed are:

1. He is a very confident person.
2. He is an artist and wants to perform surgery as an artist. That means he wants the surgery to be perfect with minimal incision. 
3. Similar traditional surgeries will involve higher incision areas, whereas, for me, the incision was very minimal. Such a type of surgery will take a longer time and require a huge amount of patience.
4. The post-surgery dressing was perfect, with pain vanishing within a day.
5. After 3 visits (in 1.5 months) the doctor asked me no further visits are necessary unless I have any problem.

I am posting this experience after 2.5 years of surgery because I wanted observe the post-surgery complications. However, there are no complications. I am able to perform each and every activity that I used to perform before. And there are no visible marks on my incision point.

Thank you doctor for the treatment.",2021-03-27 04:44:13,False,True,Rashi Simpi,,,

My mother 74y who has mobility disorder due to Parkinson’s since last two years had severe pain on both her knees over last 6 months, both her knee joints were swollen & moving her leg even while lying down hurt her very badly. 
When we consulted Dr. Kiran, after initial X-Ray investigation & Blood test he confirmed that the mother’s right knee cartilage had totally worn-out & condition of left knee is also bad…  Blood test confirmed Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) positive which most of other doctors we consulted could not detect.
The calm composed nature of Dr. Kiran & the confidence she gave my mother / all of us was remarkable. Dr. Kiran did not rush into any conclusion, he spents sufficient time (30mins+) with the patients to understand the concern every time we met him.  He could easily empathize with my mother & assured her that he will make her walk independently within 3 weeks of TKR Surgery. 

By God’s grace & healing power through Dr. Kiran my mother is now relieved of her knee pain & is able to walk independently.

God has indeed blessed you with an ability to comfort patients with your warm attitude. You are a God’s sent angel to our prayers…May God Bless you abundantly while you are on this mission to heal more & more such patients.
