"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"Mine was complete ACL tear and slight damage to meniscus, it happened in month of march 2019 while playing badminton. Before meeting Dr kamini I meet few other doctors and every one said to go for surgery Immediately.  

Later One of my friend suggested ""the fracture and orthopaedic clinic"" and I went there and  showed MRA report to Dr Kamini and she told its complete tear and I need to under go surgery but not immediately. Madam explained the complete procedure step by step and the time line involved in each stage. 

After one month i.e in month of April I undergone surgery at Columbia Asia yeshwanthpur and Operation was successful. Prior one day before the surgery I admitted in hospital and next time morning Dr Kamini did surgery.  Operation took approx 1 to 2 hours and by noon I am back to hospital room.

I would like to say a big thanks to Dr Kamini",2019-08-28 06:16:09,False,True,M Raghavendra Vijay,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"*** ** **** ** **** *** ****. Last week I undewean ACL reconstruction surgery, there were other doctors who were approaching me to get it done in their hospital but Dr. Kamini is really amazing and she let me know the process and the timeline for recovery and she gave me options if I am planing for an operation and gave me time to decide. It's been exactly a week now after my surgery and apart from mild pain I am confident that I will get back to my fitness lifestyle soon with full potential soon.
Thank you so much Dr. Kamini. üôèüôèüôè",2019-12-12 07:42:14,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Treatment satisfaction,","Knee Pain Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I had specifically taken an appointment with Dr Kamini for my mother as she is comfortable with a lady doc. On reaching the clinic on time, we were informed by the reception that Dr Kamini was not available and therefore we can meet Dr Sreenivas in her place. This qas extremely unprofessional as we had a prior appointment with her and they did not even inform us beforehand. We were made to wait for over 30minutes and then we were consulted by Dr Sreenivas. My mother was not at all comfortable but she had no other option. Once they confirm appointment they shud  stick to it or atleast attempt to inform the patient if there is any change in the appointment doctors' availability. We were charged a hefty fees and we were left unsatisfied.
