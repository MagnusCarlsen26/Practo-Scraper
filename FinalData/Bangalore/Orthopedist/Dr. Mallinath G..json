After I got the MRI report called him to visit and as he was in Apollo that day called me thr. He didint even look at my scans properly, glanced at the report and without a thought suggested Orthoscopy i.e. Surgery which he indicated would cost around 1.3 Lacs. To my surprise the same doctor was a very different doctor that day and I somehow wasn't convinced. For 2nd opinion I went to another Orthopedist and he suggested thr is no need of any surgery. He's put me on Physiotherapy and I am much better now.\r\n\r\nSuch doctors treat patients as customers or rather Victims. I am sure he get's a hefty cut on the surgeries at Apollo and I hear they have targets for each doctors for such surgeries. Strange that once a noble profession,  has now become more of a  business for such hospitals n docs.So friends always take 2nd opinion before going for any SURGERY.",

He didint even look at my scans properly, glanced at the report and without a thought suggested Orthoscopy i.e. Surgery which he indicated would cost around 1.3 Lacs. To my surprise the same doctor was a very different doctor that day and I somehow wasn't convinced. For 2nd opinion I went to another Orthopedist and he suggested thr is no need of any surgery. He's put me on Physiotherapy and I am much better now.\r\n\r\nSuch doctors treat patients as customers or rather Victims. I am sure he get's a hefty cut on the surgeries at Apollo and I hear they have targets for each doctors for such surgeries. Strange that once a noble profession,  has now become more of a  business for such hospitals n docs.So friends always take 2nd opinion before going for any SURGERY.",

Later on went to advise I have \u2018flat feet\u2019 condition. When I asked him to explain he asked me to \u2018Google\u2019 it when I go home.
