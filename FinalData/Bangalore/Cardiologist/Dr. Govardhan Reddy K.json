Doctor checked throughly, gave medical advice and asked  to avoid certain tests ( though I suggested to write)  as they are not needed and gave his personal number in case of emergency . Doctor\u2019s residence is just behind the clinic. So, he said he can attend asap.  Doctor Govardhan ( cardiac surgeon at Narayana hrudayalaya) is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable person .  I feel much better after 1 week of using the meds and following his advice . My mother had  her ECG done there and the doctors wife also spoke to me . She handles gynaecology ( at Rainbow hospitals) and she gave good advice for my mother though I didn\u2019t take Gynic consultation .  Happy to choose this clinic and would be my family docs going forward . Online payments accepted and the whole process is seamless. \nThanks a ton ans Best wishes to the Docs . ",

Well it didn\u2019t disappoint and I am now leading a happy and healthy life.\n\nDr. Govardhan is very humble & professional practitioner who invests his quality time to detail the potential health issues with possible solutions. He is approachable and available at any given time either through phone or whatsapp. Mother and heart care clinic has all the facilities and most of the basic investigations are carried out here saving us the hassle of going around which in my opinion saves a lot of time and effort.\n",

Doctor\u2019s residence is just behind the clinic. So, he said he can attend asap.  Doctor Govardhan ( cardiac surgeon at Narayana hrudayalaya) is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable person .  I feel much better after 1 week of using the meds and following his advice . My mother had  her ECG done there and the doctors wife also spoke to me . She handles gynaecology ( at Rainbow hospitals) and she gave good advice for my mother though I didn\u2019t take Gynic consultation .  Happy to choose this clinic and would be my family docs going forward . Online payments accepted and the whole process is seamless. \nThanks a ton ans Best wishes to the Docs . ",

Well it didn\u2019t disappoint and I am now leading a happy and healthy life.\n\nDr. Govardhan is very humble & professional practitioner who invests his quality time to detail the potential health issues with possible solutions.
