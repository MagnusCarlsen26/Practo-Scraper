"Wait time,Value for money,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,NO,"After waiting for over an hour for my appointment, I got about 10 minutes with the doctor. There were other senior patients ahead of me that took a long time for consultation. The doctor seemed very pressed for time even though he was very friendly and knowledgeable. I wanted a fresh opinion on my medical situation, but I didn't get the time to tell a bit about my medical history on palpitations.  After paying 750 for my appintment just like the other patients, I just got a hurried consultation. There were many health check patients consulting the same doctor. 

I don't ask for a long drawn consultation, but I should atleast get to put forward my medical situation properly. Not visiting here again.
