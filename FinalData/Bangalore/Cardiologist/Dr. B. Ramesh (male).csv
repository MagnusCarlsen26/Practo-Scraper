None,None,0,0,YES,"In short, i can say that Dr.B. Ramesh is a living god on earth who helped me to recover from problems related to heart.
I surely recommend this doctor for patients suffering from heart problems.
He is very down to earth and makes patients feel very much comfortable during his consultation.
Not like other diagnostic places, here this Doctor sits along with the Radiologist in order to diagnose the problems. This is a great advantage in his clinic.
He gives huge hopes which are more necessary for recovery instead of actual medicines.
Let me explain my story.. I had suffered from palpitations and breathlessness and i was wrongly diagnosed with ""Rheumatic heart disease"" by a big hospital in Bangalore. Because of this shock i could'nt sleep for 15 days and also the palpitations used to occur frequently. Thanks to Practo.com from where i could get the contact of Dr.B.Ramesh.
I have been under the care of this doctor from past 3 months and i have almost recovered from my health problems. This doctor has huge experience and he has got the knack of diagnosing patients just with Stethoscope.  He initially diagnosed me just with  his stethoscope and said to me ""You don't have Rheumatic heart disease :) "". These words bought me great relief, self confidence and made me very happy. Then later i was taken to ECO scan room and the doctor explained me clearly what the exact issue is and what is causing all the palpitations and breathlessness symptoms.
I have huge confidence on this doctor and i feel myself that nothing bad is going to happen to me since Dr.B.Ramesh is always there for me to take care of my health.
I am now back to my normal activities and i am able to concentrate more on my work. 
Doctor has given me the confidence that i can eat anything, i can go for trekking, and as usual continue with my normal day to day activities.
Many times i have visited his clinic and many times he has advised his receptionist not to collect fees from me. 
My hats off to his dedication and service to mankind. Long live this doctor so that many suffering patients can be cured.
