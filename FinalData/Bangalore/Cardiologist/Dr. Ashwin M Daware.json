Even you can reach him anytime in emergency.\nA very good and approachable cadiologist!\n\n",

Once he examined me he suggested ECG and Echo after checking which he told my heart was perfectly alright and the change in the pace of heart was probably just stress. He gave some tablet to bring down the heart rate. Now I'm feeling good. I would recommend this doctor.\n\n-Sathwik",

He checked reports and he say that \"I found something unusual in ECG go for Coronary Angiography which cost 9K . \" he said it's our decision he suggested us to go for it. \nWe went back to home and decided to go for Angiography . After getting Angiography he said he did not find anything in the report in which he was interested and suggested to go for angioplasty.\nwe were bit confused as he could not show up anything in the report while asking about report (no blockage) \nas my Parent stays in Rajasthan and had to leave Bangalore next day we informed patient is going tomorrow and you write what is your suggestion we will consult there.\nas soon as we said this he changed his statement he said your blockage is less then 20 % and an adult 40 years normal person would have more blockage then him and just suggested to meet any cardio every six month .\n\nThen recently(July-2016) we met another doctor in Indore for health checkup he laughed why did we come for the consultation and who asked to do all this reports ( Angio) \nHe analyzed the report done in Bangalore and said the first checkup report itself suggest nothing is there and there was no need to go for Angio.\n\nI would surely not recommend Dr. Ashwin , if he suggested for anything like Angio then go for alternate consultation  not to just save money but to avoid unnecessary mental trauma\n",

And this is because that after 20 years I have found  a doctor who is exactly like the ones who was  a family when we were kids. My Dad had some heart complaints and we had already done angiography , shown to various doctors, etc. Dr Daware was the first doctor who could pin point that dad never had an heart issue, it was a pulmonology issue. Not only did he guide us to different doctor, he took time to collate and check their reports also and guided us with humongous patience.  That is great ,,but the surprising bit is, when dad came back after one and half years for re-evaluation , he actually remembered the entire case details.  And my parents now will not even let any medication happen without his consent. My experience is he is  exactly the doctor that you have read in books about :) :) !!!",

But, he personally called me and explained why he had to do that and asked me if I was okay with the new timing. Once I visited I had to wait for just 10-15 mins. Once he examined me he suggested ECG and Echo after checking which he told my heart was perfectly alright and the change in the pace of heart was probably just stress. He gave some tablet to bring down the heart rate. Now I'm feeling good. I would recommend this doctor.\n\n-Sathwik",

He checked reports and he say that \"I found something unusual in ECG go for Coronary Angiography which cost 9K . \" he said it's our decision he suggested us to go for it. \nWe went back to home and decided to go for Angiography . After getting Angiography he said he did not find anything in the report in which he was interested and suggested to go for angioplasty.\nwe were bit confused as he could not show up anything in the report while asking about report (no blockage) \nas my Parent stays in Rajasthan and had to leave Bangalore next day we informed patient is going tomorrow and you write what is your suggestion we will consult there.\nas soon as we said this he changed his statement he said your blockage is less then 20 % and an adult 40 years normal person would have more blockage then him and just suggested to meet any cardio every six month .\n\nThen recently(July-2016) we met another doctor in Indore for health checkup he laughed why did we come for the consultation and who asked to do all this reports ( Angio) \nHe analyzed the report done in Bangalore and said the first checkup report itself suggest nothing is there and there was no need to go for Angio.\n\nI would surely not recommend Dr. Ashwin , if he suggested for anything like Angio then go for alternate consultation  not to just save money but to avoid unnecessary mental trauma\n",

And this is because that after 20 years I have found  a doctor who is exactly like the ones who was  a family when we were kids. My Dad had some heart complaints and we had already done angiography , shown to various doctors, etc. Dr Daware was the first doctor who could pin point that dad never had an heart issue, it was a pulmonology issue. Not only did he guide us to different doctor, he took time to collate and check their reports also and guided us with humongous patience.  That is great ,,but the surprising bit is, when dad came back after one and half years for re-evaluation , he actually remembered the entire case details.  And my parents now will not even let any medication happen without his consent. My experience is he is  exactly the doctor that you have read in books about :) :) !!!",
