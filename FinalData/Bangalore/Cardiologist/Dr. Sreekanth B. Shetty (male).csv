At this point my father had lost confidence in his health and was having PTSD and anxiety, but Dr. Sreekanth spent the time to counsel him.

It was a critical condition so he immediately admitted my father into CCU and treated him for 1.5 days post which he prescribed medications and now my father is fit and extremely satisfied with the treatment he received. Also, as my father is getting older, he sometimes digresses from the topic when discussing his issues, which can be extremely irritating to some doctors. However, Dr. Sreekanth paid attention and was extremely calm and made sure my father was fully satisfied and had all the information he desired. I also discussed diet and nutrition at length with him and he gave us a lot of time to answer small questions about food habits.

Dr.Shreekanth is very courteous human being, who lends his ear to the words of patient and then he approaches to the problem, in such a refined manner, that patient understand what he's being given treatment for. He supervised ECHO for my dad personally and suggested, couple of more test. As the day progressed, the results gave us huge relief, since Dr.Shetty was able to explain what ASD is and why this must not be operated at this point in time. 

We need to have more such doctors like him, who gives the right guidance & support for cardiac patients. His words of motivation helps patient & their relative to stay strong and be positive.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cardiac Ablation,",0,0,NO,I think the complete treatment process needs attention.

We read the reviews and visit the doctors but if we are redirected to any other doctor and without any conclusion  for the reason why we visited the doctor and paid fees for is not something any doctor should be doing it..for a doctor we may be just another patient but for a patient it is his life and visits particular doctor for some reason.so I think if doctor felt the tests could have been waited and conducted even after sometime..we could have waited and reaerched to see if these tests could be done more reasonably somewhere else outside if it wasn't urgent thing to be done..but if you have asked to spend 6k and get the tests done he should have been available to even verify the reports... ,2018-07-21 14:38:33,False,False,Verified Patient,"Dear sir ,
