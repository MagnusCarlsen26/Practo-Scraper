He listened patiently to every symptom which I explained to him & later he asked a few relevant questions regarding my BP, Sugar Etc. I had some recent blood reports which I showed  to him. He checked my BP & Heart rate and later told me that I have no condition of whatsoever nature related to my heart. He also substantiated his diagnosis by patiently explaining to me why he thinks so and that too with utmost authority and confidence. I feel that he is not the type of a doctor who prescribes loads of medicines and dozens of tests unnecessarily. Finally prescribed just 3 antacid tablets :).    ",
