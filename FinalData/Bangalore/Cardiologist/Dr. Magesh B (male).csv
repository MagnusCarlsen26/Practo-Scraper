None,"BP Monitoring,",0,0,YES,"I really liked how Dr Magesh took time to explain the causes of BP and also advised me on doing certain tests to rule out all the causes of high BP. He even told me that most tests will be negative but it's a 1 time thing, just to be sure. The Telma medication worked for me within 2 days of taking it. Will definitely visit him for another consultation in a few weeks after his medicine course ",2023-02-28 02:47:32,False,True,Anjan Mahapatra,,,
