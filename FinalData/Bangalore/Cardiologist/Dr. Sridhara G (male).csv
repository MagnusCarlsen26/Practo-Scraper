None,None,0,0,YES,"I do not have enough words to thank Dr Sridhar G . People are not wrong when they say doctors are next to god. 
Last 4 months i was running with series of tests and visits to different doctors including specialists. In addition got my wrong chest X ray report from one of the reputed lab. I was terrified. and was under lot of stress. Was taking all sorts of medicines.

Luckily before going for any procedure, i happen to meet Dr Sridhar. 
After talking to him half my stress vanished (though i had symptoms on upper stomach n left chest /ribs). He prescribed only one safest medicine  and just  few day i am completely normal.

He is the best doctor i saw in my last almost 50 years. Even after full busy day, the way he was talking n checking every small details from all the reports with so much patience, calm, relaxed mood and encouraging words. It was such a pleasure to meet such doctor.

I Thank him so so much for everything. 
This is just a small appreciation note with regards.
