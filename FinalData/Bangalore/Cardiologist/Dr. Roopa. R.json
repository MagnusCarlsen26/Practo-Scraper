Upon arrival at Manipal hospital consulted Dr. Roopa and briefed about the historical data and shared the previous summary. She quickly went through the historical data and simultaneously listen to both patient and the attender very carefully so that we didn't have to repeat a word.  She was quick enough to diagnose the patient and the symptoms as explained as well as her diagnostics. She knew that it was not a lung related issue but heart related as my dad had difficulty to sleep and also breath. She immediately check the pulse and check his feet (swollen). She checked the ECG report take 3 days ago and immediately advised 2D Echo, based on the results she advised immediate admission to CCU under Medical Management. Treatment was extremely satisfying and I am glad we met the right doctor at the right time.\n\nFew concerns regarding Nurse, Brother and Ward boys are as follows.\n\n1. No care for diaper change even after repeated requests from patient party.\n\n2. Nurse / Brothers are friendly but lack enough knowledge and training on thorough explanation of what treatment is being given (Unsatisfactory Explanation).\n\n** ******** *** *********** ***** *** *** **** ******** **** ** **** ** *** * ***** *** * ******* **** ********* *** ****** ******* all of them were busy in OT due to which i have to revisit the hospital on 2nd day of discharge.\n\n4. Urologist is advised RGP in 2 weeks (Nurse / Brother didn't even know what it is) this is very saddening. \n***** * **** *************************************************************************\n\nOverall Cardiologist is best recommended (10/10)\nRest everything else is average if not below.\n",

Upon arrival at Manipal hospital consulted Dr. Roopa and briefed about the historical data and shared the previous summary. She quickly went through the historical data and simultaneously listen to both patient and the attender very carefully so that we didn't have to repeat a word.  She was quick enough to diagnose the patient and the symptoms as explained as well as her diagnostics. She knew that it was not a lung related issue but heart related as my dad had difficulty to sleep and also breath. She immediately check the pulse and check his feet (swollen). She checked the ECG report take 3 days ago and immediately advised 2D Echo, based on the results she advised immediate admission to CCU under Medical Management. Treatment was extremely satisfying and I am glad we met the right doctor at the right time.\n\nFew concerns regarding Nurse, Brother and Ward boys are as follows.\n\n1. No care for diaper change even after repeated requests from patient party.\n\n2. Nurse / Brothers are friendly but lack enough knowledge and training on thorough explanation of what treatment is being given (Unsatisfactory Explanation).\n\n** ******** *** *********** ***** *** *** **** ******** **** ** **** ** *** * ***** *** * ******* **** ********* *** ****** ******* all of them were busy in OT due to which i have to revisit the hospital on 2nd day of discharge.\n\n4. Urologist is advised RGP in 2 weeks (Nurse / Brother didn't even know what it is) this is very saddening. \n***** * **** *************************************************************************\n\nOverall Cardiologist is best recommended (10/10)\nRest everything else is average if not below.\n",
