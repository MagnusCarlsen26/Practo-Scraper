The next day with reports, he is all jolly roger, the reports were with me, I was just taking them out and he said it's all fine. It may be that he is so professional and fast that or had a discussion with technician who had just left that he knew everything was all right. The impression I got was that he already knew everything was all right on the first day itself, *** ***** ***** ***** *******. Overall, I at least got to know that there is nothing to be worried about heart wise, but my experience overall was so-so. As for timing, REALLY BAD. First day, over an hour of wait. Second day, over 1.5 hours of wait on the context he was having lunch. I can make and have my own lunch in about 50 mins, so I don't know what that was about and he was not in his office since before I had come, the reception had informed he went for lunch 10-15 mins ago. So, the lunch is about 2 hours I'd say.\nKey points: I had no issue, so can't comment on doc's treatment. Time:  3/5, manner of talking:4/5\nPS: I am really really thankful he gave me some peace of mind with all the basic checks at leas,t despite the procedure experience, now I can at least stop worrying about that and go on about my daily activities as usual.",

The next day with reports, he is all jolly roger, the reports were with me, I was just taking them out and he said it's all fine. It may be that he is so professional and fast that or had a discussion with technician who had just left that he knew everything was all right. The impression I got was that he already knew everything was all right on the first day itself, *** ***** ***** ***** *******. Overall, I at least got to know that there is nothing to be worried about heart wise, but my experience overall was so-so. As for timing, REALLY BAD. First day, over an hour of wait. Second day, over 1.5 hours of wait on the context he was having lunch. I can make and have my own lunch in about 50 mins, so I don't know what that was about and he was not in his office since before I had come, the reception had informed he went for lunch 10-15 mins ago. So, the lunch is about 2 hours I'd say.\nKey points: I had no issue, so can't comment on doc's treatment. Time:  3/5, manner of talking:4/5\nPS: I am really really thankful he gave me some peace of mind with all the basic checks at leas,t despite the procedure experience, now I can at least stop worrying about that and go on about my daily activities as usual.",
