But we stepped out with a positive feeling, support and positive report after meeting him. \nHe is an outstanding person. I have never seen a doc who responds when you contact him personally. Best thing in him was, even though he works for big big hospitals, as our case was urgent he asked us come directly instead of seeking for bloody pre formalities or appointments especially when we are coming from other states. Great person. He listened the case carefully, he checked our each and every previous reports. He made us very clear what the actual issue is. Overall the treatment was fully satisfied. He might have number of number of cases in his 18 years of experience, but he treated us like his first case!! Inspired a lot!! Thank you!! ",

I politely repeated how can a common man read it as I was interested. He responded saying giving an analogy - how can an aeronautical engineer explain physics to a common man.

Best thing in him was, even though he works for big big hospitals, as our case was urgent he asked us come directly instead of seeking for bloody pre formalities or appointments especially when we are coming from other states. Great person. He listened the case carefully, he checked our each and every previous reports. He made us very clear what the actual issue is. Overall the treatment was fully satisfied. He might have number of number of cases in his 18 years of experience, but he treated us like his first case!! Inspired a lot!! Thank you!! ",
