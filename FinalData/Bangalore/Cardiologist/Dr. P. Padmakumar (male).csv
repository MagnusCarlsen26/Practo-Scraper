He is one of very arrogant doctor we have come across. We had previous Blood and other reports which was collected in other hospital, he denied to check other Hospital report and says through those old reports.He don't listen to patients and if you ask him any question, he straight fwd says don't ask any questions.He makes heart patient more tension by using hi-fi medical terminology and also Vikram Hospital diagnosis are very much expensive and doctor consultant change are very high.
