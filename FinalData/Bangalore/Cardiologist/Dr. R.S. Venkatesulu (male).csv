He had gone through Angioplasty so regarding that we met the doctor actually our appointment time was given at 11 but we could meet the doctor at 11:55 it was a long wait rather than that there are no complaints .

"Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,",None,0,0,NO,"I am diabetic and heart patient. I underwent Master health check in Aster, Sahakaranagar. I wanted to take his views. He was the only doctor available at that time and  I had to wait for him. I was asked to wait. As the wait period was very long I went back to check. He was chit chatting with some one. On seeing me then they cleared to see me.  Not at all professional approach. Sorry for the my review.
