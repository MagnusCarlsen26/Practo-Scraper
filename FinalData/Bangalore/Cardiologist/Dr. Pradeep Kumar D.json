Few things which were really touching about the doctor:\n1) he was patient enough to hear the problem\n2) considering age of my grandfather, he was very cautious about the treatment. He only prescribed tests which were really needed and suggested to manage his health condition through medicines only.\n3) As my grandfather was in Bangalore just for a few days, he provided his contact details to share the report after 1 week and very kind in responding over the phone.\n4) His staff members were also very supportive,  helped us in getting hard copy of test reports.\nThanks so much Pradeep sir!

He only prescribed tests which were really needed and suggested to manage his health condition through medicines only.\n3) As my grandfather was in Bangalore just for a few days, he provided his contact details to share the report after 1 week and very kind in responding over the phone.\n4) His staff members were also very supportive,  helped us in getting hard copy of test reports.\nThanks so much Pradeep sir!
