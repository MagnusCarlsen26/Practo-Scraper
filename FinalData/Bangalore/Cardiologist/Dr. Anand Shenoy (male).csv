"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I met the doc Mr Anand Shenoy regarding the heart issue for my cousin.. Before meeting the doc we were in like deep concern about our issue. But we stepped out with a positive feeling, support and positive report after meeting him. 
He is an outstanding person. I have never seen a doc who responds when you contact him personally. Best thing in him was, even though he works for big big hospitals, as our case was urgent he asked us come directly instead of seeking for bloody pre formalities or appointments especially when we are coming from other states. Great person. He listened the case carefully, he checked our each and every previous reports. He made us very clear what the actual issue is. Overall the treatment was fully satisfied. He might have number of number of cases in his 18 years of experience, but he treated us like his first case!! Inspired a lot!! Thank you!! ",2017-06-25 07:55:44,False,True,Mathin khan,,,

He said you need to study medicine/mbbs. I politely repeated how can a common man read it as I was interested.
