My dad in 80's said, ""For the first time, I felt wow, this doctor sees me as a person, not just a patient and helped me to manage anxiety to return to the activities I enjoy, such as gardening and walking."" 

Dr. Karthik Vasudevan is extremely caring, very personable, detailed oriented and above all his expertise and knowledge in the field of cardiology is second to none. Patients under the care of DR. Karthik have access to the latest, advanced clinical trials as he dedicates his time in advanced research and pioneer groundbreaking therapies to improve cardiovascular health.

His foremost concern is patient's well-being & showed genuine interest to help in providing a plan of action to assist in the diagnosis of medical condition, his treatment plan was easy to understand and very manageable. He encouraged questions and provided thoughtful explanations. Dr. Karthik is passionate about caring for you as a whole person, he integrated a customized nutritional diet to improve heart health into the follow-up medical management care plan, and also helped with remote patient monitoring. Our family is very thankful for him! 

Very impressed with Manipal hospial, when we went into the clinic, whether for a physical evaluation or to have heart imaged, we felt safe knowing they are taking every precaution to protect patients' health.

Dr. Vasudevan is the epitome of professionalism, a top notch doctor and recommend him unconditionally for anyone seeking a cardiologist.
