None,None,0,0,Yes,My father had visited the hospital and it was kidney related issue. Consultation was fine by the doctor. Angiogram was suggested. I would like to recommend the doctor to other people. He is patient friendly doctor. Apollo consultation amount is very costly. Tablets were prescribed by the doctor. There was more waiting time in the hospital when we went. It was for 2 -2.5 hours. ** **** ** *** *** ********,2021-06-05 13:41:02,False,True,babu,,,
