Working in a multinational company I developed this habit which I thought can help me recover back from my prediabetic state was one of the push reasons for my heart attack. It all started on a weekend with fever, followed by cramp and then an attack two days followed by it. I drove myself to Columbia Asia hospital only to faint at the reception. I was not having my heartbeat for a few minutes declared as an emergency. It was Dr Naveen Chandra who came as a God to rescue. It's all thanks to Dr Naveen n his team in emergency who got me back with a shock revival. War was still not over. I was suggested angiogram with a  block thereby within a few minutes he tried clear the block by bursting bubbles but seems to be that I started sinking but Dr Naveen got back  to my family explained them patiently on what is angioplasty and my family took a call and Dr Naveen proceeded with the angioplasty. It was an unplanned angiogram and angioplasty. Which Dr Naveen completed in a few hours. He not only helped my wife understand the consequences but also suggested how to proceed. My wife is still thankful that he was so much patient  with every single question she asked. I was critical even after the surgery as I had a nasal bleed as I was highly sensitive to medicines. Any doctor would try experimenting with different medicines but Dr Naveen tried to understand my body's requirements. Introduced medicines carefully by checking what my body is accepting and not. My wife and my friends showered Dr Naveen with n number of questions which he answered with utmost patience and care before moving me out of icu. I was discharged after 2 weeks. Even when I had fever. Dr Naveen was reachable with a single ring even at 11 in the night. So much dedication and patience. He motivates you to live a better life. Explains you every single thing about your issue. Tells you what to do, how to eat, how to work out, doesn't make you swallow unnecessary tablets. I was on 12 tablets after operation and  now I'm on 2. He treated me in emergency and now I'm visiting him frequent. He is my family doctor. I'm living a better life all coz of Dr Naveen. So much thankful to him from the bottom of my heart for giving me a new life. Thanks is so much less to say. *** **** ************ * **** **** ***** Young, intelligent, smart, quick, humble and always approachable with a smile. I totally suggest everyone to reach him in case of anything with respect to heart problems.",

The doctor did an Echo and diagnosed severe PASP along with other age related heart problems and immediately put her on higher dose of diuretics. He did not rush us into admission. Although we were a new patient, the doctor was reachable on phone for clarification and on whatsapp thereafter to keep a close tab on blood work to adjust dosages. Today, my mother has shed all that excess fluid and is on a steady dose of medicines. Her quality of life has improved, thanks to Dr.Naveen Chandra.\n\nI very strongly recommend Dr Naveen Chandra. His calming demenaour immediately put my mother at ease. He genuinely listened to everything that my mother had to say and did not belittle any of her complaints. While  the doctor kept it real to me and my brother about my mother\u2019s condition, that she cannot take in surgical interventions, he did not give up on her. He reassured my mother that she will get better with medicines. \n\nMy mother had twice been hospitalized in a prominent hospital and all I remember is doctors would often go \u2018she has too many problems\u2019, and a sympathetic hollow gaze. We felt very helpless. Contrast this to meeting Dr. Naveen who was reassuring with the patient, realistic with us and spot-on with the treatment as the results show. \nHats off to such compassionate and equally competent doctors in these times.

My father had major blockages in all the arteries and only option was bypass with endarterectomy. With extreme patience and empathy he addressed our concerns and explained risks involved. We couldn't decide immediately to go for surgery because of all the risks. My father had to go through lot of other health complications due to this. Finally we went for bypass surgery a couple of months back and my father is doing fine now. Throughout the struggle Dr Naveen Chandra stood with us, he would respond to the messages and calls and suggest right medications and always was there to guide us and help us. He is a very competent and empathetic doctor. Really thank him for all the support he had given us medically and for the guidance.",

When we rushed him to Columbia hospital doctors informed us of his condition and that they cannot assure us anything. \nThanks to Dr. Naveen's expertise that my father recovered so fast. Most of the expert doctors were of the opinion that open heart surgery is the only go for my father. But Dr. Naveen turned this major surgery down, he handled the situation with angioplasty and this gave my father a speedy recovery and a normal life now. Through the entire period he was so comforting with us. His humbleness, kind attitude, empathy and hard work has made us indebted to him forever. \nNo matter how late it is in night, any issue Dr. Naveen is available at the next available moment making us aware of the condition and the next step. I cannot expect more. Even now when we meet him for regular check up, he meet us in the same way. Any emergency no matter what time it is on the clock he replies our call, messages. Always reachable. \nWe are fortunate to have a doctor like him. We wish him all success and good fortune in his life. ",

Then we consulted Dr.Naveen Chandra. During first visit itself, he suspected it to be a condition of Arrhythmia (mostly SVT condition), if at all the palpitations are because of something related to heart malfunctioning. He did not rush us to go for Surgical treatment. He first wanted to see if medication works. Medication did no work. In my mother's case, the palpitations lasted for about only a minute. As a result, non-surgical diagnosis (such as ECG/Echo-cardiogram/Holter monitoring) did not work. Doctor then suggested to use a portable Oximeter to see if pulse rate goes high during palpitations. As guessed by him, we observed very high pulse rate confirming that the problem is related to heart. So we were then advised to go for Ablation treatment (EP Studies). This is basically done to do both diagnosis (which type of Arrhythmia) and treatment. Thanks to Dr.Naveen Chandra, now my mother is free from the problem and is very healthy. \n\nDr.Naveen Chandra is very friendly and caring. He explains the problem very patiently and why he is opting for that particular treatment/medication. He is very patient in answering all the queries that we might have about the procedures involved. He is also available on phone for his patients. I highly recommend him for heart related ailments. Thank you doctor once again. Namaste.",

Working in a multinational company I developed this habit which I thought can help me recover back from my prediabetic state was one of the push reasons for my heart attack. It all started on a weekend with fever, followed by cramp and then an attack two days followed by it. I drove myself to Columbia Asia hospital only to faint at the reception. I was not having my heartbeat for a few minutes declared as an emergency. It was Dr Naveen Chandra who came as a God to rescue. It's all thanks to Dr Naveen n his team in emergency who got me back with a shock revival. War was still not over. I was suggested angiogram with a  block thereby within a few minutes he tried clear the block by bursting bubbles but seems to be that I started sinking but Dr Naveen got back  to my family explained them patiently on what is angioplasty and my family took a call and Dr Naveen proceeded with the angioplasty. It was an unplanned angiogram and angioplasty. Which Dr Naveen completed in a few hours. He not only helped my wife understand the consequences but also suggested how to proceed. My wife is still thankful that he was so much patient  with every single question she asked. I was critical even after the surgery as I had a nasal bleed as I was highly sensitive to medicines. Any doctor would try experimenting with different medicines but Dr Naveen tried to understand my body's requirements. Introduced medicines carefully by checking what my body is accepting and not. My wife and my friends showered Dr Naveen with n number of questions which he answered with utmost patience and care before moving me out of icu. I was discharged after 2 weeks. Even when I had fever. Dr Naveen was reachable with a single ring even at 11 in the night. So much dedication and patience. He motivates you to live a better life. Explains you every single thing about your issue. Tells you what to do, how to eat, how to work out, doesn't make you swallow unnecessary tablets. I was on 12 tablets after operation and  now I'm on 2. He treated me in emergency and now I'm visiting him frequent. He is my family doctor. I'm living a better life all coz of Dr Naveen. So much thankful to him from the bottom of my heart for giving me a new life. Thanks is so much less to say. *** **** ************ * **** **** ***** Young, intelligent, smart, quick, humble and always approachable with a smile. I totally suggest everyone to reach him in case of anything with respect to heart problems.",

The doctor did an Echo and diagnosed severe PASP along with other age related heart problems and immediately put her on higher dose of diuretics. He did not rush us into admission. Although we were a new patient, the doctor was reachable on phone for clarification and on whatsapp thereafter to keep a close tab on blood work to adjust dosages. Today, my mother has shed all that excess fluid and is on a steady dose of medicines. Her quality of life has improved, thanks to Dr.Naveen Chandra.\n\nI very strongly recommend Dr Naveen Chandra. His calming demenaour immediately put my mother at ease. He genuinely listened to everything that my mother had to say and did not belittle any of her complaints. While  the doctor kept it real to me and my brother about my mother\u2019s condition, that she cannot take in surgical interventions, he did not give up on her. He reassured my mother that she will get better with medicines. \n\nMy mother had twice been hospitalized in a prominent hospital and all I remember is doctors would often go \u2018she has too many problems\u2019, and a sympathetic hollow gaze. We felt very helpless. Contrast this to meeting Dr. Naveen who was reassuring with the patient, realistic with us and spot-on with the treatment as the results show. \nHats off to such compassionate and equally competent doctors in these times.

Someone from our apartment had suggested Dr Naveen Chandra, so we went to consult him. He suggested for angiogram and after the angiogram he explained to us the situation of my father. My father had major blockages in all the arteries and only option was bypass with endarterectomy. With extreme patience and empathy he addressed our concerns and explained risks involved. We couldn't decide immediately to go for surgery because of all the risks. My father had to go through lot of other health complications due to this. Finally we went for bypass surgery a couple of months back and my father is doing fine now. Throughout the struggle Dr Naveen Chandra stood with us, he would respond to the messages and calls and suggest right medications and always was there to guide us and help us. He is a very competent and empathetic doctor. Really thank him for all the support he had given us medically and for the guidance.",

When we rushed him to Columbia hospital doctors informed us of his condition and that they cannot assure us anything. \nThanks to Dr. Naveen's expertise that my father recovered so fast. Most of the expert doctors were of the opinion that open heart surgery is the only go for my father. But Dr. Naveen turned this major surgery down, he handled the situation with angioplasty and this gave my father a speedy recovery and a normal life now. Through the entire period he was so comforting with us. His humbleness, kind attitude, empathy and hard work has made us indebted to him forever. \nNo matter how late it is in night, any issue Dr. Naveen is available at the next available moment making us aware of the condition and the next step. I cannot expect more. Even now when we meet him for regular check up, he meet us in the same way. Any emergency no matter what time it is on the clock he replies our call, messages. Always reachable. \nWe are fortunate to have a doctor like him. We wish him all success and good fortune in his life. ",

Then we consulted Dr.Naveen Chandra. During first visit itself, he suspected it to be a condition of Arrhythmia (mostly SVT condition), if at all the palpitations are because of something related to heart malfunctioning. He did not rush us to go for Surgical treatment. He first wanted to see if medication works. Medication did no work. In my mother's case, the palpitations lasted for about only a minute. As a result, non-surgical diagnosis (such as ECG/Echo-cardiogram/Holter monitoring) did not work. Doctor then suggested to use a portable Oximeter to see if pulse rate goes high during palpitations. As guessed by him, we observed very high pulse rate confirming that the problem is related to heart. So we were then advised to go for Ablation treatment (EP Studies). This is basically done to do both diagnosis (which type of Arrhythmia) and treatment. Thanks to Dr.Naveen Chandra, now my mother is free from the problem and is very healthy. \n\nDr.Naveen Chandra is very friendly and caring. He explains the problem very patiently and why he is opting for that particular treatment/medication. He is very patient in answering all the queries that we might have about the procedures involved. He is also available on phone for his patients. I highly recommend him for heart related ailments. Thank you doctor once again. Namaste.",

He did a thorough investigation of my father's health condition and suggested for a Permanent pacemaker implantation. He was kind, open, and even supportive enough for us to take a second opinion with our regular Cardiologist before we planned for my father's surgery. He patiently explained us all the pros of different models of pacemakers, and helped us to decide on the best brand / model currently available. My father had a successful pacemaker implantation done and is stable now. Dr. Naveen was very friendly, supportive and approcable round the clock. In today's \"Professional Medical World\", it's really difficult to find doctors like Dr. Naveen, who are not only a master of their subject, but also humble and possess a human touch. I highly recommend you to visit Dr. Naveen for any Cadio related issues / concerns (as you will be in safe hands) :)",

My father admitted to emergency for his severe breathlessness condition for almost more than 2 days though treatment is given where real cause is not known. By God\u2019s grace Dr. Naveen Chandra taken my father case at early morning hours around 2 AM and explained the real cause for the breathlessness condition which is due to the blockage in my dad heart. He explained very well about my dad heart condition and suggested angioplasty as the first action. Though my dad is very sensitive about the medical operations as he never faced any health conditions till then, Dr. Naveen Chandra taken at most care for my dad health condition both physically and mentally.

The general physician inquired my father and adviced us to take ECG which revealed abnormality in heart functioning. She immediately called Dr. Naveen to look into the condition.\n\nDr. Naveen immediately started the treatment and immediately arranged for angiogram. I told doctor to take into consideration that my father has high serum creatinine level. After looking at the history, he told me that usage of dye for angio should be as minimal as possible for patients with kidney disease, otherwise it will be a big overload on kidneys and would cause kidney failure. Once the angiogram had been completed, he explained that there were two blocks. One was 100% and the other one 80%. He mentioned that 100% block should be removed first and the other one can be treated later. He also explained the severity of the block showing how the block is stopping the main blood flow and how other arteries are compensating the blood flow in the cath lab. He recommended us to go for an immediate angioplasty, as there is no other option. \n\nOnce we gave him our go ahead, he performed angioplasty and it required one stenting also. The whole procedure took around 45 minutes and it was successful. After the procedure, he showed me how the blood became normal after angioplasty and stenting.\n\nWe have been following up with doctor after the procedure and very recently we have done the second angioplasty&stenting for my father to remove the second block and he has been doing well.\n\nOne thing I want to highlight is that the doctor is available on whatsapp and phone call and provides advice and guidance in case of any queries anytime. He has responded to all my queries till date. Once my father was hospitalized in a different city, I called up the doctor, explained the symptoms and shared reports. He had gone through all the reports and provided directions and advices. That was really helpful in managing the situation. \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Naveen for consultation related to heart diseases. He is very friendly, explains the issues clearly and approachable. ***** ** ** ******** ********** * ***** *** ** ** *** ** *** **** ******* * **** *** ** ****\n\n",

He listened to us very patiently and answered each and every question. In the ICU situations he took decisions which were medically just right and more importantly keeping the patients needs in mind.

She had an attack of arrythmia later that day fortunately she was saved and we owe her life to doctor Naveen and staff. He responds to messages and calls even outside working hours.

After conducting multiple  ECG and Holter tests and having discussions with him we arrived at the conclusion that a pace maker implant was a must. He is very friendly and explains the process in detail and with utmost patience. He is very dedicated and a nice human being. I thank him for conducting the angiogram and pace maker implant procedures successfully  , thanks to him I am doing well now. ",

Doctor spent good amount of time over phone and in real to understand surgery associated risks. He also co-ordinated with other specialists like oncologist, ENT and anestheisia specialist quickly. He was even in sync with the nursing station and labs and all reports! As a bonus he even knew the prominent oncologist who was my fathers previous doctor from Mangalore. I have not seen a doctor like this. All I say is Thanks!",

Doctor takes keen interest in curating personalized treatment plan and monitoring, which is now days a rarity to find.

She had to get an angiogram followed by an angioplasty with stent. She had gotten an angiogram by another doctor a few months before and was totally traumatized by the experience and the pain. Doctor Naveen Chandra eased her and not only that, made the whole experience pain free. Been regularly seeing him for almost 2 years now.

It has been a year now that my mom has been visiting him regularly. Every session, with doctor willing to lend her an ear for all her queries and making changes in her medication to bring her back to normalcy and  comfort.
