"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Heart Conditions,Hypertension Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Since June 2021, I have been feeling constant heaviness/pressure in my left chest.  Before meeting Dr KP Srihari in Sept 2022, I had met other Cardiologists, and had got all the tests done such as Lipid profile, Echo, TMT etc. As per my Lipid profile report, I had high Triglycerides and low HDL. Also, my Echo indicated mild concentric LVH in my heart. As per doctor, LVH was because of high BP, and hence I was put on BP medicine(Olmezest 20mg, Proloment 12.5 XL). I was also prescribed Rozuvas F5 to treat my high triglycerides and low HDL. The BP medicine helped in bringing my BP from 150/100 to 120/80 and even lower. Also, my triglycerides went down from 350-400 to 100-110 in a few months of taking the medicine. However, the constant and irritating chest heaviness stayed as before. So, finally, I went through Coronary Angiogram also in Mar 2022, to rule out any blockage in my blood vessels; the report was negative. I also went through Gastro Endoscopy to find out if gas was causing the chest heaviness, but it was not the case either. The endoscopy indicated H Pylori infection my stomach, and I took treatment to clear the infection, but my chest heaviness was still there.
So I decided to change my Cardiologist; and based on one of my friend's recommendation, met Dr KP Srihari in Sep 2022. He went through my complete medical history very patiently and explained me the treatment plan. He got some basic tests such as Echo, TMT and Lipid profile done for me and told me not to worry about the chest heaviness. He advised me to continue with the BP and Triglyceride  medication, and to have an active and healthy lifestyle that includes daily exercise and yoga. Overall, I found the Doctor very knowledgeable and friendly. He explained me my condition without sugarcoating any fact, but at the same time ensured that I had a proper plan to help myself. During my multiple interactions with the Doctor, I always felt he was genuinely interested in improving patients health condition, and nothing else. I would highly recommend him to anyone having any heart related ailment(s).",2023-09-11 10:30:20,False,True,Chandan Bhagat,,,

I got high BP in my early 30s and have been on BP medication since then. Being an otherwise athletic person, the fact that I had to take daily pills did not sit well with me. Most of my previous doctors in India, US and UK, had a very matter of fact approach, and to a young hypertension patient who loved to have a good life, it caused a lot of anxiety. 5 years back I consulted Dr Srihari Das. He has been very kind and patient and we have been working together to gradually bring down the daily dosage, and it has worked very well. He asks for further investigations like ECG and Echo only when really necessary and explains very well in layman terms for my understanding, whether the combination of medicine and daily diet and exercise routine has been working for the heart. We have also met him for my Mom’s regular check-up. She is in her mid-70s and still operates without any medication of any kind. 

I will highly recommend Dr Das for any Cardiology related issues. He has an excellent clinic in Jayanagar where you can meet him if you cannot make it during the day time at the hospital. ",2022-01-10 15:41:55,False,True,Som,,,

None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Srihari is the best cardiologist. Why I'm say so because of my personal experience. What does a person expects if he's consulting a doctor- First the doctor to listen calmly, Second to initiate diagnosis immediately, Third to suggest treatment options explaining risks and benefits, Fourth to understand patient's pain and financial limitations and be cooperative and finally keeping patient informed of the health condition and progress. I found this all while my father was undergoing treatment under him. Apart from this:
1. He's Expert in his field. He identified heart problem from looking into my father's ECG, while other doctors said its normal. My father was discharged in 24hrs.
2. He's Experienced. He performed Angioplasty for three blockages in an hour without compromising with the treatment. Also, I was kept informed of the progress at regular intervals, so OT was not a black box for me.
3. He's very Calm. He had as many conversations as and when I had to answer my queries.
4. Friendly and understanding. He's very cooperative and helpful. In fact he reprioritized his schedule to accommodate my father's treatment understanding the severity.
