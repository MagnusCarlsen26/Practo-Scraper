I was searching on Practo for a cardiologist for my fathers stenting. We already consulted three doctors before we had seen Dr. Pradeep. All of them said two stents required and they didn’t even spent time in understanding the patients condition. But Dr. Pradeep is not like that, he took notes while explaining to him and he clearly told us what was misleading to a judgement of two stents instead of one. Gave lot of emotional support to my father. This means a lot to a patient, that’s what happened to my father even. 

He is much better than before. Dr. Pradeep really explains even the medication what he prescribed for what and why he had to do that. No unwanted tests or medicines. He takes complete care and gives the best possible solution that is the best any patient can get. It’s not only during the operation even after that he asked us to stay back for one day extra to testify that stent is working fine. My dad was very very happy with his treatment and fully satisfied with the complete process.
