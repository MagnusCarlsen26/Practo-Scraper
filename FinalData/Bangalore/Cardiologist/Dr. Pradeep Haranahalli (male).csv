"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Atrial Fibrillation,",0,0,YES,"In November 2017, my mother-in-law was visiting from Maharashtra and suddenly developed breathing issues. We admitted her to Manipal Hospital Whitefield. Dr Pradeep Haranahalli who was at the emergency saw her and diagnosed her condition as atrial fibrilation and arrhythmia. He told us that her heartbeat needs to be stabilized and then see the cause of the of high heartbeat. He mentioned that it will take 1 to 2 days for the heartbeat to to stabilize. And he was bang on. She recuperated in the four days and was discharged. Dr Pradeep really took care of her and was very patient for our questions and gave a very thoughtful and balanced answer. One time I called him to ask a question after 9 PM but he didn't pick up the phone, as he might be busy. So I thought he may not call me back but to my surprise he did call me and clarified my question (I was happy). After her heartbeat was stabilized he said that she needs to be on medication and there is no need for surgery. He also did an angiogram and told there were no blockages. I feel this doctor is really good and he is not trying to make $$$ unnecessarily by scaring the patient's family(under duress), as some do. He is a very calm, quiet, ************* and thoughtful Doctor who gives ear to the patient's family. Once I told to the doctor that the food was not given on time to the patient in HDU. So immediately he summoned the nurses / canteen manager and told them such things should not have happened and not to happen again. He also very nicely and clearly explained the anti blood clot medications (the new one vis-a-vis the world one). I really appreciate his selfless treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Our association with Manipal Hospital, Whitefield in general and Dr Pradeep Haranahalli in particular was quite unforeseen as my wife developed certain gynaecological problems while we were on a visit to our relative's place in Whitefield which was just opposite the Hospital. And as things unfolded she was diagnosed with endometrial adinocarcinoma of the uterus, grade I which  in plain words is first stage cancer of the uterus. This was terrible news for us for which we were mentally and otherwise not prepared. 
But eventually the cancerous tumour was surgically removed before which numerous tests were done on her to evaluate her preparedness for surgery. It was during this that I came in contact with Dr Pradeep who turned out to be more than I had bargained for. He is such a gentleman, very mild-mannered and reassuring and always listening to her problems to be of help. To say the least he is one of those not having the airs of being a specialist doctor and very firmly rooted to the earth. Like a teacher he would explain the problems related to her and how he planned to get over it. My wife was a little apprehensive before the angiogram was done on her but she told me later that Dr Pradeep allayed all her fears and did the procedure commendably. Moreover he went out of his way to get us the results as quickly as possible. Even after the surgery whenever we went to the hospital for follow-up which was quite frequent we might come across him discussing something with a patient or doctor but he would immediately notice us from afar and acknowledge our presence. This was really a welcome gesture on his part which I think surely goes a long way to make the rapport with he instantaneously makes with his patients. I would occasionally ask him certain queries regarding my wife and he would immediately respond with a smile.  I still maintain contact with him even so many months after she was released from the hospital. I may mention here that my wife is at present okay by the grace of God.
I said so at our time in the hospital to him and I am saying it again that Dr Pradeep Haranahalli  has the markings of a true doctor and he will surely make a name for him. I wish him all success from my heart.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Heart Conditions,Pacemaker Surgery,",0,0,YES,"First time I visited Doctor Pradeep Haranahalli was in 2017, regarding the heart condition of my father. My father lives in Odisha, 83 years that time, had then undergone angioplasty in one of his arteries. The second artery needed rotablation, which the doctor in Bhubaneswar was hesitant to do. So I decided meet 3-4 famous cardiologists in Bangalore (Narayani Hridalaya, Manipal old airport rd) with my father's reports and take opinion. What struck me about Dr Pradeep is his silent confidence. He was through, made detailed notes, saw all the reports/CDs. He was confident that the proceedure can be safely done despite of old age. He clearly conveyed to us that age is not a factor in such surgeries. We liked his attitude because it was different from other doctors who discouraged us to try anything because of old age. (My father was fit otherwise). I was living in US that time where people drive till 88 years if they are healthy.
We decided to go with Doctor Pradeep because of his thoroughness, confidence, accessibility. In 2018 my father came down from Odisha and after check up was decided to implant pacemaker. Dr Pradeep took a special care, from admission till discharge. He himself was present with the nurses in all post -surgical processes. He was very patient with my father, in mobilizing him etc. Today my father has a big trust on him. He lives in Odisha and I moved to another country but we are in contact with Doctor Pradeep via phone, whatsapp on medicine doses, advice etc. We are fortunate to have met Dr Pradeep. We highly recommend others. He wants to genuinely help patients.  ",2019-01-19 05:09:43,False,True,Reema,,,

He was having this known health issue in the past seven years but now the condition was bad and needed an immediate attention. Previously he was under assumption that he was having some minor leakage in heart for which he was already consuming tablets but without any significant outcome. By god's grace things fell in place just at the right time as we met Dr Pradeep.  He started diagnosing my father step by step from beginning through various tests. Very soon he arrived at the conclusion that my father is having some serious blockage in left main coronary artery that was causing the chest pain. He then called upon Dr. Vivek Babu Bojjawar, discussed the issue, and recommended to go for CABG procedure as the blockage was more than 70 percent and angioplasty stenting won't be successful. I am very much thankful to both Dr Pradeep and Dr Vivek who clearly explained me the current condition and also explained why CABG was necessary. They provided me adequate clinical information that helped me to confidently provide my consent for the CABG procedure. All went as per the schedule. The procedure was successfully carried out by Dr Vivek, Dr Pradeep and their expert team of doctors that took around 4 hours. In a week's time my father was discharged from hospital. In little more than a month he was fully recovered and back to normal. Now he is completely back to life. Just within 3 months of time lot many things have changed for good.

Gave lot of emotional support to my father. This means a lot to a patient, that‚Äôs what happened to my father even. 

He is much better than before. Dr. Pradeep really explains even the medication what he prescribed for what and why he had to do that. No unwanted tests or medicines. He takes complete care and gives the best possible solution that is the best any patient can get. It‚Äôs not only during the operation even after that he asked us to stay back for one day extra to testify that stent is working fine.
