Dr. Sreekanth was immediately able to identify the issue as low electrolyte levels. At this point my father had lost confidence in his health and was having PTSD and anxiety, but Dr. Sreekanth spent the time to counsel him. I was happy with the confidence and decisiveness of his treatment. It was a critical condition so he immediately admitted my father into CCU and treated him for 1.5 days post which he prescribed medications and now my father is fit and extremely satisfied with the treatment he received. Also, as my father is getting older, he sometimes digresses from the topic when discussing his issues, which can be extremely irritating to some doctors. However, Dr. Sreekanth paid attention and was extremely calm and made sure my father was fully satisfied and had all the information he desired. I also discussed diet and nutrition at length with him and he gave us a lot of time to answer small questions about food habits. With Dr. Sreekanth's support, I've been able to switch my father to keto diet on a short term basis, which has greatly helped him in reducing weight and diabetes and improving mood. I want to personally thank him for being a supportive and calming doctor, who prescribes minimal medications and is ready to answer any and every question of the patient.",

This is when, we decided to go for a second opinion. I have high regards for PRACTO, which helped me to find out Dr.Shetty.  Feedbacks, he has received from the patients or their near relatives, encouraged me to meet him at SAKRA hospital. \n\nDr.Shreekanth is very courteous human being, who lends his ear to the words of patient and then he approaches to the problem, in such a refined manner, that patient understand what he's being given treatment for. He supervised ECHO for my dad personally and suggested, couple of more test. As the day progressed, the results gave us huge relief, since Dr.Shetty was able to explain what ASD is and why this must not be operated at this point in time. \n\nWe need to have more such doctors like him, who gives the right guidance & support for cardiac patients. His words of motivation helps patient & their relative to stay strong and be positive. \n\nThanks Doc!!!!",

Dr. Sreekanth B Shetty is extremely friendly, understood my mom's condition, prioritized the visit, thought 360 degrees to avoid migrations to other vitals. Doctor is very knowledgeable about complication and gave a serious thought between home management or hospitalization for my mother. Finally decided on home care based on few tests and reports. The staff is very helpful in understanding , took personal care in prioritizing the visit. Special mention about Shabnam on her good response, She was helpful in keeping slot open for me as i need to come back home and get her back to the doctor. Dr Chitra was responsive in coordinating with the staff today too and got the doctor's appointment. Thanks Svasti Heart care. Definitely recommend this doctor and clinic for all cardiac problems. Interventional Cardiology is 3X complicated than any other cardiac issues. so Go to this doctor for best consultation .",

Dr. Sreekanth was immediately able to identify the issue as low electrolyte levels. At this point my father had lost confidence in his health and was having PTSD and anxiety, but Dr. Sreekanth spent the time to counsel him. I was happy with the confidence and decisiveness of his treatment. It was a critical condition so he immediately admitted my father into CCU and treated him for 1.5 days post which he prescribed medications and now my father is fit and extremely satisfied with the treatment he received. Also, as my father is getting older, he sometimes digresses from the topic when discussing his issues, which can be extremely irritating to some doctors. However, Dr. Sreekanth paid attention and was extremely calm and made sure my father was fully satisfied and had all the information he desired. I also discussed diet and nutrition at length with him and he gave us a lot of time to answer small questions about food habits. With Dr. Sreekanth's support, I've been able to switch my father to keto diet on a short term basis, which has greatly helped him in reducing weight and diabetes and improving mood. I want to personally thank him for being a supportive and calming doctor, who prescribes minimal medications and is ready to answer any and every question of the patient.",

This is when, we decided to go for a second opinion. I have high regards for PRACTO, which helped me to find out Dr.Shetty.  Feedbacks, he has received from the patients or their near relatives, encouraged me to meet him at SAKRA hospital. \n\nDr.Shreekanth is very courteous human being, who lends his ear to the words of patient and then he approaches to the problem, in such a refined manner, that patient understand what he's being given treatment for. He supervised ECHO for my dad personally and suggested, couple of more test. As the day progressed, the results gave us huge relief, since Dr.Shetty was able to explain what ASD is and why this must not be operated at this point in time. \n\nWe need to have more such doctors like him, who gives the right guidance & support for cardiac patients. His words of motivation helps patient & their relative to stay strong and be positive. \n\nThanks Doc!!!!",

Doctor is very knowledgeable about complication and gave a serious thought between home management or hospitalization for my mother. Finally decided on home care based on few tests and reports. The staff is very helpful in understanding , took personal care in prioritizing the visit. Special mention about Shabnam on her good response, She was helpful in keeping slot open for me as i need to come back home and get her back to the doctor. Dr Chitra was responsive in coordinating with the staff today too and got the doctor's appointment. Thanks Svasti Heart care. Definitely recommend this doctor and clinic for all cardiac problems. Interventional Cardiology is 3X complicated than any other cardiac issues. so Go to this doctor for best consultation .",

I was being asked to carry out certain heart related tests post consultation and asked us to show him the reports.. by the time I finished all the tests the doctor had already left for the day without even looking at the reports for which I spent 6k.. when called the doctor he asked to consult some junior doctor who was available on duty..i think if we were asked to under go some tests to eliminate any risks it becomes doctors duty to be available to even check the reports rather than redirecting the patient to some other doctor. We read the reviews and visit the doctors but if we are redirected to any other doctor and without any conclusion  for the reason why we visited the doctor and paid fees for is not something any doctor should be doing it..for a doctor we may be just another patient but for a patient it is his life and visits particular doctor for some reason.so I think if doctor felt the tests could have been waited and conducted even after sometime..we could have waited and reaerched to see if these tests could be done more reasonably somewhere else outside if it wasn't urgent thing to be done..but if you have asked to spend 6k and get the tests done he should have been available to even verify the reports...

Since he was working in Fortis, we have been consulting him for my father health concerns. Most humble and soft spoken, he listens to patients concerns. He came midnight 1am to hospital and did the surgery. He explained us so we'll, made sure my father will be normal and strong soon. I can definitely say he is like our family doctor. Any time even night 12 he replies to patients call and message. I am truly blessed to get such doctor. My father got angioplast done by him. Thank you so very much sir. Hats off to your patience and the confidence you give to us. I will always recommend you sir.",

So you have ample parking space. The clinic is beautifully designed and extremely clean. The front desk people were friendly and courteous. \nWait time : I had an appointment for 6:40 pm and I reached there at 6:30 . They took my details and immediately I could see the doctor . \nConsultation experience: doctor seemed to be a nice guy . He spent enough time in listening to me and never rushed. That's one of my pet peeves. He didn't suggest any unnecessary tests. I visited him to check some irregularities in my ECG and he prescribed an echo test(for my peace of mind I asked him to do TMT as well , he didn't ask for it though ). Overall I had a great experience with the clinic/doctor and I highly r commend them . ",
