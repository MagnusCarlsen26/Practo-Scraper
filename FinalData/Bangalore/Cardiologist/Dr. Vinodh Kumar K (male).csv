None,None,0,0,YES,*** ****** ** *** *** ** ********* He was super quick in making decisions and handled my father's major cardiac arrest case very well... Due to major issues there were many complications associated.he was v patient in explaining everything to us in detail and dint superficially try to keep us away from what was happening. He made sure personally if everything was right and coordinated with other department doctors too and was available round the clock for us. Only coz of him and his treatment my dad is home now..thank you doctor..blessed to have come across such a genuine expert doctor who not only does his job well but gives a human touch to it which is lacking in many doctors today without making it feel like a burden or obligation ,2023-06-05 09:09:52,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
