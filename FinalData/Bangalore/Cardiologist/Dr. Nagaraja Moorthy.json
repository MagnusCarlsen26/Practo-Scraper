He was our third consultation as we had consulted two doctors from reputed hospitals before. Although the previous doctors had diagnosed the issues accurately, they had advised to undergo angioplasty. But when we met Dr Nagarajamoorthy, he studied the reports in detail and himself conducted 2D echo to understand the heart condition thoroughly and he explained the risk involved angioplasty considering my father's heart functioning condition. He advised for medication and regular follow ups. Just recently conducted the 2D echo and there is remarkable progress in heart functioning of my father. Certain parameters which was in severe stage last year, now  has come to mild and moderate condition. This is where he stands out i.e., in devising the 'intervention' based on patient's fitness and wellness. Also at times, especially last year, he was available on WhatsApp too by guiding and clarifying our doubts. I thank him for timely guidance and treatment and wish him for more strength to serve people. I definitely recommend him.",

Doctor could find out the deterioration in functioning of pacemaker battery. He explained us in details about the consequences and how her heart is functioning at present. He guided us to contact pacemaker supplier. Pacemaker supplier responded quickly and we received the new battery.\nBattery replacement was done at Fortis by Dr Nagaraj Moorthy. Operation was very smooth, my mother did not experience any pain during operation and post operation. Operation was critical, my mother\u2019s age is 86 years and doctor has to do operation on previously operated area to implant new battery. It was done so skilfully on the scar area that my mother grossly appreciated Doctor. Dr Nagaraj\u2019s behaviour is quite appreciable, his approach with the patient is very warm and caring. He patiently replied to all the queries of my mother with a smile. Post operative sessions were all good....dressings were smooth. My MA regained her health. We thank Dr Nagaraj whole heartedly ",

He was our third consultation as we had consulted two doctors from reputed hospitals before. Although the previous doctors had diagnosed the issues accurately, they had advised to undergo angioplasty. But when we met Dr Nagarajamoorthy, he studied the reports in detail and himself conducted 2D echo to understand the heart condition thoroughly and he explained the risk involved angioplasty considering my father's heart functioning condition. He advised for medication and regular follow ups. Just recently conducted the 2D echo and there is remarkable progress in heart functioning of my father. Certain parameters which was in severe stage last year, now  has come to mild and moderate condition. This is where he stands out i.e., in devising the 'intervention' based on patient's fitness and wellness. Also at times, especially last year, he was available on WhatsApp too by guiding and clarifying our doubts. I thank him for timely guidance and treatment and wish him for more strength to serve people. I definitely recommend him.",

Doctor could find out the deterioration in functioning of pacemaker battery. He explained us in details about the consequences and how her heart is functioning at present. He guided us to contact pacemaker supplier. Pacemaker supplier responded quickly and we received the new battery.\nBattery replacement was done at Fortis by Dr Nagaraj Moorthy. Operation was very smooth, my mother did not experience any pain during operation and post operation. Operation was critical, my mother\u2019s age is 86 years and doctor has to do operation on previously operated area to implant new battery. It was done so skilfully on the scar area that my mother grossly appreciated Doctor. Dr Nagaraj\u2019s behaviour is quite appreciable, his approach with the patient is very warm and caring. He patiently replied to all the queries of my mother with a smile. Post operative sessions were all good....dressings were smooth. My MA regained her health. We thank Dr Nagaraj whole heartedly ",

We reached out Dr Nagaraja Moorthy and he responded immediately at a short notice and explained us the alternate ways of treatment by medication. Its been a month and my mother's condition has improved via medication guided by Dr Moorthy and the heart beats has become normal. Dr Nagaraja Moorthys calm composure, ability to simplify and explain issues and solutions helped us. We are thankful to Dr Nagaraja Moorthy for giving the confidence and guidance.

Dr Nagaraj\u2019s humble and jovial nature really helped us in the situation. We are very fortunate to have met a wonderful doctor and a human being like Dr Nagaraja Moorthy.

                "review_text": "Doctor literally gave my father a second life. We had visited the doctor for my father's health condition. he was feeling tired even after doing small work. When we visited the doctor he straight away diagnosed the problem and we got to know there are blockages in the heart veins. When Nagaraj sir did the Angiogram we got to know that it was 7 blockages in the veins. So if we had waited for some more time, then i don't know what would have happened. Had to undergo Bypass surgery and everything is looking fine now. We are really thankful to Nagaraj Murthy sir for saving my father's life!!",

Now I was diagnosed with no heart related problems and have altered my medication for hypertension accordingly. Dr. Nagaraja sir is very friendly, he carries enough patience to listen our concerns and make us feel very comfortable. I'm now slowly recovering and feeling stress free. I strony recommend Dr. Nagaraja sir for all cardiac related issues. Thank you so much Doctor. ",

Dr. Moorthy did an immediate ECG, that showed minor variations, hence he followed up with an echo which came out to be normal and then further a blood test to ensure that there were no indicators of adverse effects on the heart.\n\nSince it was my first interaction with a cardiologist I was really nervous leading to heightened BP. However the doctor put me at ease and outlined a clear line of treatment. Dr. Moorthy exhibited personal interest in obtaining older reports and comparing the findings with the lateest ECG. He suitably adjusted the diagnostic process post evaluation which eventually led to discovery of no major issues.\n\nApart from the urgency of the follow up, the calm demeanour and collected response to a potentially life threating situation was a great comfort when going through the process. I highly recommend Dr. Nagaraja Moorthy for any cardiac related issues.",

We were informed before surgery that two valves in the heart need to be replaced. But, after the surgery, during first check up of my mom, Doctor said there is small issue in the operation and again we have to do one more operation. My Mom didn\u2019t have much strength to accept one more surgery and we were totally upset. My mom gradually developed breathing issues  and whenever she went to the hospital, she could never meet senior doctor. Infact my dad and my mom used to wait from morning to evening waiting\n\nI want tell  about him that I have never seen such a simple person. The way he talks with patient with his positive attitude, it really boosts up the morale of the patient and the family members.  His medication has helped my Mum to get better within a week and he still calls up personally to check her heart condition , I want to thank doctor sir once again and I am so  happy to see the way he gives service. Thank so much whole Family would like to thank Doctor NAGARAJ MOORTHY. \nBecause of you my mum is still alive...\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

The main surgeon and other doctors and staff at Fortiss Hospital also treated us very cordially.\n\nOn account of the moral courage instituted by Dr.Nagaraja Moorthy, I could come back to normal life within a very short span of time.  While thanking him for his cordial services, I would like to avail his services and guidances in future also.\n\n",
