None,None,0,0,YES,"It was great pleasure meeting Dr.Girish Godbole ,I had some issues with my heart, he started explaining the actual problem in me, like gospel truth he pointed out every single issues and made me to understand so clear that the problem is not in my heart,but its WITHIN me. Such a great personality, and it's such a pleasure listening to him , the agony I was going through, he made to vanish from my heart. With his speech, I regained my will power and left his cabin as a new man. It's very seldom to find such great person in this present world. May god bless and give him good health.

None,None,0,0,YES,"An amazing cardiologist who takes time to explain in detail what is happening in your body and how you need to respond to it. Not in a hurry at all even during these Covid times to send you off without a proper diagnosis and without making you feel confident that you are in good hands.

None,None,0,0,NO,"Very bad experience with Dr. Girish Godbole. He was very unprofessional. His attitude towards the patient who is need of his help was horrible. He was not approachable and people friendly. He did not have the patience to listen to the problem and ""insisted"" the patient listens to him before even stating her problem. Does not exhibit humility and empathy. Absolutely no point of a consultation. At the end of the consultation, we have no solution to the problem. ****** ***** ** **** * **** ***** **** ***** ******* *** ***** ** **** *** *** ******** *** ***** *** ** *** *** ******* ********* ***** *** ********* ** **** ***** ** *** ** ********* *** ***** ******* ** ** ************* ** ******* * ******** *** *** ***** ** *** *** ** *** ************* ",2021-05-11 07:49:21,False,False,Avinash Devakumar,,,
