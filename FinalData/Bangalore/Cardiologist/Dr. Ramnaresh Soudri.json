He educated me about the BP goal, i used to think 150 is normal range,but he explained the importance of BP control to avoid complications in future. Upon consultation doctor had suggested to change the medicine for BP.  We started monitoring regularly and since then there was no  fluctuations in his BP like earlier.  Very much liked his consultation and referred to my relatives as well.\nMost important thing is doctor doesn't suggest unnecessary tests and investigations unless required.",
