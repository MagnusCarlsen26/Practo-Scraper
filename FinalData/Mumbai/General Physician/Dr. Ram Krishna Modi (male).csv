"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Outpatient treatment,Consultation,",0,0,NO,"I had a very bad experience with doctor who was treating a close family member. We were his proper regular patient and had even been admitted in hospital under his care multiple times. The experience was horrendous. I have lost the family member today. It doesn't matter which problem we went to him with, the attitude, the arrogance, the audacity and most important Insensitivity of the doctor towards a patient who is on death bed.
