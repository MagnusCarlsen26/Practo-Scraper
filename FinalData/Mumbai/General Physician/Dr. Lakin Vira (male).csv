Hats off to them. So lets begin i was feeling sick from past few days so I wrote my health issues on free consultation. There where doctor who actually took interest in my health condition. But I was not satisfied. With answers. But yes their was one warrior who‚Äôs answer really satisfied me . So I consulted further my health issue actually I was quitting smoking I didn‚Äôt know the withdrawal symptoms of smoking can be that messy I was so worried becoz the symptoms were almost like pandemic (üåû)whole country is facing. Anxiety attacks many more fever nd all  He really helped me physiologically nd off courses by advising medicines he actually took his time for his patients. Which shows that how dedicated he is towards his work nd patient i was so relaxed .
