I visited Dr Vasudev he immediately confirmed the diagnosis and explained about my father's terminal nature of the condition. He was sympathetic to us in explaining the gravity of the situation and made us understand that there could be very little which can be offered as treatment to my father in this terminal condition. Doctor admitted my father when he was extremely sick and got him better by just conservative treatment without any expensive care. He taught us the \"end of the life care\" which can be offered at home itself avoiding the unnecessary expenses of hospitalisation. My father today is happy though weak at present living amongst us at our own home. I am greatful to Dr Vasudev and his team of doctors for the support which they extended to us during the hard times we had been through. What I appreciate about Dr Vasudev is that he is straightforward and doesn't make the patient spend unnecessarily for expensive test and expensive treatment which the patient may not require in all the instances",

Seems like he went to the washroom and in that 5 min the doctor's office called 5 times and messaged him back \"called you 5 times, no response\".

I visited Dr Vasudev he immediately confirmed the diagnosis and explained about my father's terminal nature of the condition. He was sympathetic to us in explaining the gravity of the situation and made us understand that there could be very little which can be offered as treatment to my father in this terminal condition. Doctor admitted my father when he was extremely sick and got him better by just conservative treatment without any expensive care. He taught us the \"end of the life care\" which can be offered at home itself avoiding the unnecessary expenses of hospitalisation. My father today is happy though weak at present living amongst us at our own home. I am greatful to Dr Vasudev and his team of doctors for the support which they extended to us during the hard times we had been through. What I appreciate about Dr Vasudev is that he is straightforward and doesn't make the patient spend unnecessarily for expensive test and expensive treatment which the patient may not require in all the instances",

Seems like he went to the washroom and in that 5 min the doctor's office called 5 times and messaged him back \"called you 5 times, no response\".

It\u2019s your problem if you didn\u2019t want to do any particular investigation. But treatment is not possible without the same. Wrt charges, the charges are inclusive of everything which includes anaesthesia consumables and other logistics which are billed separately at other places. They are not colonoscopy charges alone. Don\u2019t play a victim card by blaming the doctors and writing some crap. You will understand when you visit other places.. All the best..",

I would say it is the best center for painless endoscopy. After endoscopy I got to know I have stomach ulcers. He gave me prescription for 2 weeks & I am completely fit now.\n\nWould recommend him if you want the right treatment & early recovery. He prescribes only after proper diagnosis which I think is the right approach.\n\nI am highly thankful to Dr Vasudev.",

Your previous doctors had advised right medications but unfortunately they didn\u2019t help you. \n\nIn such cases it is medically wise to advise investigations to find out as to what exactly the reason why you are having persistent symptoms. The same was explained to you in detail before ordering investigation. We thought that you would be coming for investigations next day as scheduled and informed to you. \n\nSince you said that you are not inclined to undergo investigations to the receptionist on the phone and wants medical treatment, we sent you the prescription which we felt is the best without doing investigations. Seek second opinion about the opinion I gave from medically qualified person. I can only say \u201cAll the best to you\u201d for your mindset that doctors advise investigations to make money. God bless you with good health",

We made patients waiting for endoscopy procedures to wait since we wanted to save your time, we accommodated you in between since it was a few minutes examination in your case. I still don\u2019t know the diagnosis since examination couldn\u2019t be completed because of your excruciating pain. I don\u2019t know if you still wanted the examination to be done despite your excruciating pain. \n2. We asked you to come for sigmoidoscopy the following day to be done under sedation which would be painless so that we make a proper diagnosis and treat you. Mind you, sigmoidoscopy is a test which can\u2019t be done on the same day since it requires a bowel prep. You were told to come next day after proper preparation of the bowel. We don\u2019t take charges for the test on the day of prescribing. We charge only on the day the test is done. \n\nYou said we were in hurry. It seems like you are in a \nhurry and you didn\u2019t not want a proper diagnosis and wanted treatment assuming that it is piles and not something else. Just to tell you, I don\u2019t treat the patients without making a proper diagnosis. May be you will find a better doc. All the best anyways",
