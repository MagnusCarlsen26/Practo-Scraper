Anyone who sees me cannot believe that I was previously hospitalised for 12 days n had undergone such harrowing experience.",

He has a smiling profile and makes the patient at home plus explains the procedure of treatment.\n\nThe doc is accessible easily and he responds immediately if the call couldn't be attended.\n\nMy blood sugar was high and  Dr. Rajanshu took it as a priority n brought down the level to normal (90/145)\n\nThe hospital I was in previously was giving priority to other aspects but when I changed doctors and met Dr. Rajanshu, he knew my priority was diabetes.\n\nThanks to Dr. Rajanshu Tiwari to make me look normal. Anyone who sees me cannot believe that I was previously hospitalised for 12 days n had undergone such harrowing experience.",
