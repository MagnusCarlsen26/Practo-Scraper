None,None,0,0,NO,"I am very disappointed & I would like to bring to Practo notice, on 6th Mar'24 , I visited Dr.Madhulika Goyle - Verified  & booked by Practo for a basic health fitness certificate for learning swimming lessons. 

On my 1st visit on 6th Mar'24, like any other patient I just observed from my patient seat as I trusted the doctor that she has mentioned my correct name & has signed stamped. Then I just took the certificate envelope & left. Later when I finally got the time to enroll the classes & was approaching my swimming class * *** ********* **** ********* ******* *********** ****** ** ** ****** ****** ****  *** ********* ** **** ***** ****** * I too have other work & commitments then later I manage to pay a personal visit & sort this but her clinic was closed till 13th May'24 .So on 20th May'24, I searched through Practo & booked appointment and contacted her about the issue. After learning that it was her fault she told me to cancel Practo booking else Practo will charge as both (I am expecting that I am not been charged for cancellation by Practo) , she insisted & I cancelled my practo booking.
