You have visited our clinic for your gastric issues after your symptoms failed to respond to medications advised by your previous doctors. Your previous doctors had advised right medications but unfortunately they didn’t help you. 

In such cases it is medically wise to advise investigations to find out as to what exactly the reason why you are having persistent symptoms. The same was explained to you in detail before ordering investigation. We thought that you would be coming for investigations next day as scheduled and informed to you. 

Since you said that you are not inclined to undergo investigations to the receptionist on the phone and wants medical treatment, we sent you the prescription which we felt is the best without doing investigations. Seek second opinion about the opinion I gave from medically qualified person. I can only say “All the best to you” for your mindset that doctors advise investigations to make money.

1. We made patients waiting for endoscopy procedures to wait since we wanted to save your time, we accommodated you in between since it was a few minutes examination in your case. I still don’t know the diagnosis since examination couldn’t be completed because of your excruciating pain. I don’t know if you still wanted the examination to be done despite your excruciating pain. 
2. We asked you to come for sigmoidoscopy the following day to be done under sedation which would be painless so that we make a proper diagnosis and treat you. Mind you, sigmoidoscopy is a test which can’t be done on the same day since it requires a bowel prep. You were told to come next day after proper preparation of the bowel. We don’t take charges for the test on the day of prescribing. We charge only on the day the test is done. 

You said we were in hurry. It seems like you are in a 
hurry and you didn’t not want a proper diagnosis and wanted treatment assuming that it is piles and not something else. Just to tell you, I don’t treat the patients without making a proper diagnosis. May be you will find a better doc. All the best anyways",2021-03-13T10:20:19+0000,Dr. Vasudev
