I was under home quarantine but was constantly in touch with doctor. What I realised is that Coronavirus is more of a mental illness than physical . But being under observation of Dr Yatin really helped me fight the illness , stop panicking and helped me recover in hardly a 5-6 days. My symptoms started reducing and in no time my report was negative in second test. I thank Dr Yatin for all his service and help extended.",
