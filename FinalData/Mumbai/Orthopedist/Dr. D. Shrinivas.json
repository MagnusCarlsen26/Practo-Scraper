Without even doing X-ray he told I have first stage of flip disc which is little scary. I am doing work from home now for 10 -12 hours in this covid time. Sitting in one place for long time, but I can't believe it would be flip disc. There was less waiting time in the hospital. Hospitality was good. ",
