The BEAR procedure is reserved for certain indicated cases only. In your case it was not a clear indication for BEAR. 
We do understand that you came with the idea of getting Only the BEAR procedure, however from our experience with this procedure we believe in doing it selectively only where indicated and will ascertain good results with low failure rate. Your case was better suited for a reconstruction. 
We continue to believe in giving honest opinions and not opinions for patient appeasement or acquiring surgery. 
Thank you for the feedback. 
Best wishes for your surgery.
