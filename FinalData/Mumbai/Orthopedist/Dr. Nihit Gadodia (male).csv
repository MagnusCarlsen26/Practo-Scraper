None,None,0,0,YES,Doctor Nihit explained the problem very clearly after listening carefully to the problem faced. One thing we liked is he did not scare us and made us at ease. After assessment he prescribed medication and all necessary precautions to prevent further damage. Very pleased with such positive doctor. ,2024-03-16 13:52:26,False,True,Kiran Naik,,,
