"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"My mom's both knee replacement@ her age 75 years, done by Dr. Kaushal Malhan on 15/10/2019. Result is Awesome. In one go, means only one anesthesia (to lower the risk).  No Blood loss, minimal invasive Surgery,  no muscle cut or damage, No Physiotherapy done. No pain. Our experience was Superb.  Awesome nature Doctor,  recommends operation ONLY IF NEEDED , listen patient's problem carefully and peacefully,  explains whole procedure in detail till post operation & recovery stage.
Initially, We have thought of taking another Doctor's opinion. But after consulting him, we were so satisfied,  we have no reason to take second opinion. I am writing this after 2 & half years. We are very happy with results,  so we are strongly recommending Dr. Kaushal Malhan for knee replacement surgery. Do watch his you tube videos for more details.
