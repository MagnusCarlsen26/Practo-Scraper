"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Shoulder Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Dear Dr. Gawai,
I could never put into words or fully express my gratitude to you for the quality of treatment that we received from you.

I was visited your clinic to treat my father’s shoulder problem. I was scared and nervous when you suggested a surgery for the issue. Which I think is common reaction when we heard the word “Surgery”. 
You build the confidence and complete trust from the pre-entrance testing to post-surgery.

I was impressed with the professionalism *** ***** **** ***** *** ********* *** ********** We were all accomplished by very professional, caring staff members. I have never had such a great experience with a medical team.

You and your staff should all be very proud of the service and care you provide to those of us that have parts of our bodies that just wear out!!  

You are a fantastic physician/surgeon, a wonderful person and you have a gift for making your patients really feel important & cared about. 
I will continue referring you to everyone I know.

I am forever grateful to you.
