"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Lumbar Pain,",0,0,YES,"I was having severe lower back pain and later the pain was radiating from my back till the feet.  Dr. Satyen diagnosed it as a disc herniation case and properly explained what was the underlying issue that was causing the excruciating pain. He advised to go with the minimally invasive surgery and explained the specifics of the same. After my surgery in USSH hospital, I was able to walk the very next day-with support; and in three days-without any support. Dr. Satyan embraces latest techniques and technology in surgery/ medical science, which helped me in solving the issues of my spine, and aided early recovery.Another great thing about him is that the way he communicates with the patients, instills confidence that we are in good hands. He calmly answers all the questions, no matter how trivial they are. I highly recommend Dr. Satyen for any spine/back related problem. Once again, thank you for helping me.",2021-10-18 15:49:38,False,True,Ashwin Iyer,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,My mother fell and got compression Fracture on her back. She was not able to sit and stand at all. I got her admitted to near by hospital for one week but orthopaedic doctor keep on saying that with time she will be fine and she will recover slowly. Then I got her shifted to Surana Sethia hospital and met with another orthopaedic doctor who suggested to do back surgery and put rods to give support on upper and lower bone. I decided not to go for such a big surgery as my mom was around 60 years. Then I got to know about doctor Satyen Mehta and took appointment. He explained in detail on what can be done to make my mom standup and he did laser surgery which only took few hours. And only finger size cut on the back. After one hour of surgery he entered the room and holded my mom's hand asked her to stand up. i couldn't believe that she started walking. He saved my mom twice.,2021-09-07 06:43:03,False,True,Vijay Kumar Gupta,,,
