                "review_text": "We consulted Dr Shah for my mother who is 67 years old. She was suffering from acute knee pain and was very scared to go for operative procedures. She had a history of spine operation performed in 2012. Due to which she was worried abt immobility post operative procedures. We were advised to consult DR shah through a very close friend Dr Rahul Shah. Who was very confident abt Dr siddharth shah.\n\nDuring our first consultation Dr shah made my Mom understand each and every aspect of the surgery and her recovery procedures. Through which she got all the confidence which was required and she finally agreed to go for the surgery. As the pain was acute and knee replacement was required in both her knees we decided to perform both knee replacement together as proposed by Dr Shah. \n\nThe operation was scheduled within next 4 days of the 1st consultation. Mom got admitted and every detail about the operative cost and procedure of the Insurance was clealry told to us by the Hospital management, also they made sure that every thing was hassel free.\n\nOn the schedule day of the operation which was to start at 8.30 am Dr shah briefed us abt the operative time and procedure, also he breifed us about the robotics procedure that was suppose to be performed. Since the operation was for both the knees time taken for the operation was around 8.00 hours. Around 4.30 Mom was shifted back to the ward. Where she was seemed to be relaxed. At 5.30 the same day Dr Shah visted her and asked to stand, we were shocked as it was just one hour post operation, but he was very sure, and mom stood nd took few steps. We were all very relived. During our 4 days stay at the hospital regular physiotherapy sessions were conduted under the guidance of Dr Shah. We left hospital on 5th day with Mom having a new confidence in her, walking on her own without a wheel chair.\n\nIts been a month and half now, the recovery is very good, mom is able to do her daily chores. She has even started going out without any help. All thanks to Dr Siddharth Shah. I see a new confidance in her which she lacked prior to her surgery. \n\nI would higly recommend Dr Siddharth Shah, as i feel he is the best in his field, a very soft spoken personality and confident about his work.\n\nThank you Dr Shah for all the efforts you took to convience Mom and made her reliase that its worth taking the risk than suffering from pain.",

Our family doctor whom we completely trust and go to for advice on all medical issues immediately recommended Dr Siddharth Shah. Dr Shah was very clear with his diagnosis. At the same time he was very patient and explained the specific issue with us and the mode of treatment going forward. Since it was an issue requiring immediate treatment he organised for the procedure to take place on a holiday at the hospital. I am sure the timeliness of the operation helped in ensuring better recovery for my father. In these COVID times with all hospitals taking extra care and restricting meetings between patients and their relatives, Dr Shah took extra effort in explaining to the nursing team to ensure proper care and attention to be given to my father in our absence during his stay at the hospital. Further, even for meetings, Dr Shah would come down and meet us in the lobby of the hospital to assuage all our apprehensions regarding my father\u2019s condition and his progress. He would promptly and clearly respond to all clarifications sought on Whatsapp. Finally the proof is\u2026my father is noticeably getting better and we are grateful to Dr Shah for his treatment.  ",

He explained everything about the surgery and eased us that there will be no issues after the operation.\n\nWithin two months, my father had the knee replacement surgery successfully.

She had a history of spine operation performed in 2012. Due to which she was worried abt immobility post operative procedures. We were advised to consult DR shah through a very close friend Dr Rahul Shah. Who was very confident abt Dr siddharth shah.\n\nDuring our first consultation Dr shah made my Mom understand each and every aspect of the surgery and her recovery procedures. Through which she got all the confidence which was required and she finally agreed to go for the surgery. As the pain was acute and knee replacement was required in both her knees we decided to perform both knee replacement together as proposed by Dr Shah. \n\nThe operation was scheduled within next 4 days of the 1st consultation. Mom got admitted and every detail about the operative cost and procedure of the Insurance was clealry told to us by the Hospital management, also they made sure that every thing was hassel free.\n\nOn the schedule day of the operation which was to start at 8.30 am Dr shah briefed us abt the operative time and procedure, also he breifed us about the robotics procedure that was suppose to be performed. Since the operation was for both the knees time taken for the operation was around 8.00 hours. Around 4.30 Mom was shifted back to the ward. Where she was seemed to be relaxed. At 5.30 the same day Dr Shah visted her and asked to stand, we were shocked as it was just one hour post operation, but he was very sure, and mom stood nd took few steps. We were all very relived. During our 4 days stay at the hospital regular physiotherapy sessions were conduted under the guidance of Dr Shah. We left hospital on 5th day with Mom having a new confidence in her, walking on her own without a wheel chair.\n\nIts been a month and half now, the recovery is very good, mom is able to do her daily chores. She has even started going out without any help. All thanks to Dr Siddharth Shah. I see a new confidance in her which she lacked prior to her surgery. \n\nI would higly recommend Dr Siddharth Shah, as i feel he is the best in his field, a very soft spoken personality and confident about his work.\n\nThank you Dr Shah for all the efforts you took to convience Mom and made her reliase that its worth taking the risk than suffering from pain.",

At the same time he was very patient and explained the specific issue with us and the mode of treatment going forward. Since it was an issue requiring immediate treatment he organised for the procedure to take place on a holiday at the hospital. I am sure the timeliness of the operation helped in ensuring better recovery for my father. In these COVID times with all hospitals taking extra care and restricting meetings between patients and their relatives, Dr Shah took extra effort in explaining to the nursing team to ensure proper care and attention to be given to my father in our absence during his stay at the hospital. Further, even for meetings, Dr Shah would come down and meet us in the lobby of the hospital to assuage all our apprehensions regarding my father\u2019s condition and his progress. He would promptly and clearly respond to all clarifications sought on Whatsapp. Finally the proof is\u2026my father is noticeably getting better and we are grateful to Dr Shah for his treatment.  ",

Dr Siddharth Shah was referred by our family doctor, firstly he had investigated all the reports as father was suffering from other health issues. He explained everything about the surgery and eased us that there will be no issues after the operation.\n\nWithin two months, my father had the knee replacement surgery successfully.
