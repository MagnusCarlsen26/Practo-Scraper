"Wait time,","Hand Pain Treatment,",0,0,NO,I reached the appointment well within time only to find out that the doctor isn't available. If he's not going to be available he should inform and cancel the bookings he has accepted or not accept them in the first place. This is absolutely unacceptable. Very unprofessional. ,2020-02-28 08:33:48,False,False,Arushi Agrawal,,,
