Awesome nature Doctor,  recommends operation ONLY IF NEEDED , listen patient's problem carefully and peacefully,  explains whole procedure in detail till post operation & recovery stage.\nInitially, We have thought of taking another Doctor's opinion. But after consulting him, we were so satisfied,  we have no reason to take second opinion. I am writing this after 2 & half years. We are very happy with results,  so we are strongly recommending Dr. Kaushal Malhan for knee replacement surgery. Do watch his you tube videos for more details. Google search on his tissue preserving technic article.",

Awesome nature Doctor,  recommends operation ONLY IF NEEDED , listen patient's problem carefully and peacefully,  explains whole procedure in detail till post operation & recovery stage.\nInitially, We have thought of taking another Doctor's opinion. But after consulting him, we were so satisfied,  we have no reason to take second opinion. I am writing this after 2 & half years. We are very happy with results,  so we are strongly recommending Dr. Kaushal Malhan for knee replacement surgery. Do watch his you tube videos for more details. Google search on his tissue preserving technic article.",
