"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"Extremely satisfied with surgery and post-operative care. My mother's anxiety levels were through the roof pre-surgery period. Having been through multiple hospitals and doctors, it was bound to happen too. But Dr.Khanna was reassuring, experienced and explained in detail beforehand what the expect, so we weren't feeling blindsided or shortchanged as far as information was concerned. The surgery went off well and it was the right decision to go ahead with the surgery at Wockhardt with Dr. Mudit Khanna. Highly recommend for all patients considering knee replacement surgeries.
