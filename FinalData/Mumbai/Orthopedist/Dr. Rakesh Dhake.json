She was suffering from sciatica pain and numbness for the last 15 years. We were always scared when it came to getting her surgery done. For the last few months, the pain has been unbearable and she was not able to stand or walk for more than 2-3 mins. Thanks to sir for the timely rescue. No doubt it will take time for her to recover but the surgery went well and the symptoms have weaned off. I highly recommend Dr Rakesh for spinal treatments. Thank you Sir. \n ",
