"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Acl Reconstruction Surgeries,",0,0,YES,"\""I cannot express enough gratitude for Dr. Biswajeet Naidu and his exceptional care for my ACL surgery. After consulting with several doctors, I chose Dr. Naidu because of his expertise, professionalism, and the confidence he instilled in me from our first interaction.\n\nThe surgery itself was a complete success. Dr. Naidu performed the procedure with precision and care, ensuring everything was done to the highest standard. His post-surgery instructions were clear and comprehensive, greatly aiding my recovery.\n\nBefore my surgery, I had heard of several cases from colleagues and acquaintances where ACL surgeries had gone wrong, or the recovery post-surgery was not up to expectations. These stories instilled a lot of fear in me. However, Dr. Naidu's approach and assurance helped alleviate those fears, and I felt I was in the best possible hands.\n\nA significant factor in my decision to go with Dr. Naidu was his realistic and optimistic recovery plan. While other doctors recommended a six-week rest period, Dr. Naidu assured me that I could resume work in just two weeks. This was crucial for me as I had recently joined a new company and had constraints regarding leave. His confidence and guidance in this regard helped me tremendously on the job front, allowing me to return to work sooner than expected.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Naidu apart is the remarkable recovery I experienced. Within just three months, I was able to walk without a stick and the need for a brace. This was a testament to the skilful surgery and the effective rehabilitation plan Dr Naidu provided.\n\nMy motor skills have significantly improved, and I am regaining strength and mobility at an impressive rate. Dr. Naidu was always available for follow-up appointments, and his encouragement and support were invaluable. He took the time to listen to my concerns and answered all my questions, which made a huge difference in my recovery journey.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Biswajeet Naidu to anyone in need of ACL surgery or any orthopaedic care. His expertise, dedication, and compassionate approach to patient care are truly exceptional. Thank you, Dr. Naidu, for giving me back my mobility and improving my quality of life.\",2024-07-30 21:52:12,False,True,Sumithra,,,
