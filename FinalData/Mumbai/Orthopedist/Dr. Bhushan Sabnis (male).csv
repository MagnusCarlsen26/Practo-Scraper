"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Knee Osteotomy,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Bhushan Sabnis, firstly a big thank you. He's not only an excellent surgeon but an amazing human being I have ever met. He is extremely calm and kind.  One amazing quality he has is he would maintain complete transparency with his patients. His confidence to resolve a complex case like mine gave me a relief that I'm in safe hands. It seems its his passion to take n resolve complex cases with ease. He's always there to answer your queries and gives you satisfactory explanation unless you're convinced. I remember right from my first meet till date of my post operative visits, one thing he has constantly asked me ""ask?"" (this brings smile on my face) which means he not only understands that I had a query but also ready to answer the same n explain me well. This is the best I have ever seen in any doctor. He's completely approachable and always boosted my confidence pre-post surgery. He's truly a gem and god's messenger gifted to us in this era to our nation.  Stay blessed doctor. Lods of Love and Thanks for being there. ",2018-07-14 18:02:42,False,True,Divya Racch ,,,
