First we were made to meet the assistant doctor ,thereby followed by Dr Archik who patiently heard us out and advised us the line of treatment. I have previously visited the doctor for my father ,and now for my husband and I would highly recommend him. He ,unlike many others, does not advise surgery unless absolutely required. Follow up due after a month. Will post an update then. \nFor quality treatment do visit him! ",

Due to this Dr Archik declared that my mother needs Psychiatric treatment before undergoing knee replacement surgery. This is not the way a doctor makes a patient comfortable.
