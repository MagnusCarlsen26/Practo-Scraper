I met couple of Spine surgeons in Mumbai who gave me like 10 mins of rushed consultation and charged exorbitant fees , told me its Sciatica and suggest injections. But the condition didn't improve and finally surgery was recommended. I came to know about Dr Bhavin from a relative. He gave us enough time to look and understand my condition and clear all my doubts. He also took out time to explain the same once again to my family. I was convinced that I have made the right choice and we went ahead with Dr Bhavin for my Spine surgery. We also would like to mention that he did the surgery at a very nominal cost at a premium hospital like Hinduja Khar. It came out to be half the cost what other doctors has quoted. And I was able to walk and got discharged in 2 days. His post operative care and Followup from his team is also excellent. ** ** *** **** ***** ******* ** ****** *** a Doctor who is there to genuinely care for you.",

I met Dr Bhavin Shial and after checking my reports we realised that my condition is a bit severe . We first tried medicines to get the pain in control and later he suggested me pain reducing injection which is injected in the spine. Within a day itself I felt much better after the injections. Now to maintain my back condition I am following the exercise suggested by him. I am very satisfied with his way of treatment",

My father was able to walk painfree within a week with his guidance and could manage to avoid surgery.

I met couple of Spine surgeons in Mumbai who gave me like 10 mins of rushed consultation and charged exorbitant fees , told me its Sciatica and suggest injections. But the condition didn't improve and finally surgery was recommended. I came to know about Dr Bhavin from a relative. He gave us enough time to look and understand my condition and clear all my doubts. He also took out time to explain the same once again to my family. I was convinced that I have made the right choice and we went ahead with Dr Bhavin for my Spine surgery. We also would like to mention that he did the surgery at a very nominal cost at a premium hospital like Hinduja Khar. It came out to be half the cost what other doctors has quoted. And I was able to walk and got discharged in 2 days. His post operative care and Followup from his team is also excellent. ** ** *** **** ***** ******* ** ****** *** a Doctor who is there to genuinely care for you.",

He suggested me to wear a cervical collar for few days at work which helped me to get better. In my follow up visit ,he also suggested me to correct my posture at work and raise the height of my laptop. He showed me some back strengthening exercise and to avoid some of the weight lifting exercise that i was doing. My pain was improved in a week's time. I would highly recommend him.",

I was scared that I will have to undergo a spine surgery. I approached spine specialist Dr Bhavin Shial at his Andheri clinic. He was very helpful and gave me good advice. He cured me without surgery and now i am able to go back to normal routine. Thanks doctor for the quick recovery.",

We approached a couple of doctors who suggested that surgery would be needed post which my father would have to do a 3 to 4 months bed rest. We met Dr Bhavin Shial by the recommendation of our family doctor. We initially feared with the idea of surgery, but Dr Bhavin patiently explained to us why it was needed in our case and what all activities he would not be able to do if surgery is avoided. He recommended us Minimally invasive spine surgery which would ensure early recovery. The surgery was done in a very budget cost and my father was able to walk in just 3 days and he could resume most of his activities within 10 days of surgery. Infact he resumed office in 2 weeks. The entire period of recovery was handled very well by Dr Bhavin and he and his team was always available.\nWe are extremely happy with the outcome and feel he is the best spine specialist we could have asked for.",
