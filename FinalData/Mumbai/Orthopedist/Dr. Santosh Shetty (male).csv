"Doctor friendliness,Wait time,","Joint and Muscle Problems,",0,0,NO,It was very bad experience. They have booking of 4 patients of same time including me that is 8.30pm. I arrived at time but they said that first come first serve. Then also some random people came n they gave entry first. I was in too pain and waiting for my turn. I though the doctor was gossip with one person in his cabin more than half hour. After some complaint from the doctor came rudely answer. After that he handles all pending patient with 2-3 minute each.It was very horrible experience and expect this type of behavior and management from such qualified doctor. ,2020-01-22 07:34:32,False,False,Verified Patient,,,

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Knee replacement,",0,0,YES,"My name is SJ Shetty (Seetharam Shetty) age 72 years. I was a middle-distance runner and participated in many sporting events during my younger days. But since the last 10/15 years, I am suffering from severe knee pain and am unable to walk. As a result, I lost self-confidence and confined myself to the four walls of my house. I did a lot of treatment, met quite a few doctors and many suggested knee replacement surgery but I was not convinced.  

My two sisters-in-law did their knee replacement surgeries with Dr Santosh Shetty and after seeing their progress and their confidence I approached Dr Shetty who explained the difficulties I may face later on and the benefits of knee replacement. 

Finally, I have gone through the right knee replacement and my knee which was meant inwards has straightened out making me feel much better. Waiting to get totally free of knee pain after my left knee replacement. I thank Dr Santosh Shetty for his guidance and treatment.
