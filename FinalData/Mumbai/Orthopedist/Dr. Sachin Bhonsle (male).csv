"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Hip Resurfacing,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Sachin Bhonsle - A true gem, a genuine professional, a thorough analyst, an amazing listener, an impeccable gentleman. 

Extremely qualified, yet super humble.

The best part was, when the patient was taken to the OT, he told me - Don't worry, I will take decision on the table, the way I would take for my own family member. These things matter a lot. Quite a caring doctor. May he be blessed with a long and healthy life so that he can heal more and more patients.

In today's world, it is difficult to find a medical practitioner who insists on saving money thereby recommending **** surgery.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"We took our mother 76 years old at that time (about 6-7 months ago) with severe swelling of the ankle accompanied with pain. As usual he asked us to get an X-ray done. Then he claimed that there was a hairline fracture in her ankle joint and hence plastered it for 3 weeks making my slightly immobile mother completely immobile. Once the plaster was removed since the pain persisted,he then ruled out the cause of the swelling and pain was due to fracture. I think Dr Sachin was extremely insensitive and *********** in handling this case. When we subsequently went to other Orthopedic doctors, they all questioned the fracture angle.  I wouldn't suggest anybody to take their dear ones to this doctor due to the lack of a proper attitude towards diagnosis and treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Osteoporosis,",0,0,YES,He is very professional and his diagnosis was spot on. He guided us on the right treatment and also alerted us what to not to get swayed with. My mom had knee issues so besides treatment he guided us why we shouldn’t go for knee replacement which some others doctors may prescribe. Her knee was all good in sometime. When we were changing cities he got us in touch with the right doctor to continue the treatment. He even replied on emails when I needed help from the other city. I highly recommend him. ,2021-07-13 17:00:52,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
