None,None,0,0,YES,I had a very good experience with Dr. Kapil. I was advised many years back by multiple doctors to undergo knee replacement.  But Dr. Kapil gave me genuine advice and told me to wait. Finally 1 month back I under went knee replacement by him.  The surgery was done in a day and started walking the same day! My son also was treated by him for shoulder injury.  I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for an orthopedic doctor. He is the most kind and genuine person I've met !,2024-07-02 06:52:19,False,True,Neha bajaj,,,
