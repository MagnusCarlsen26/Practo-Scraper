"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"Pre surgery: Visited Dr. Akash Saraogi on recommendation of my daughter Dr. Shivali Shah, they were classmates, for intense pain endured for some time in both knees. The first thing that struck us apart from his comforting welcome was that he was so humble and listened patiently to my history. Then he suggested bilateral TKR. I was understandably nervous and even more so as my daughters live abroad. He reassured us with his kind words and backed it all up with outstanding preparation, professionalism and expertise. 

Experience: The surgery was performed on both knees wonderfully with punctuality and great follow up. The entire Team of Doctors and the staff were so polite and knew their job so well. They answered all our questions and we felt very well informed, cared for and guided. The hospital is well equipped with latest hi-tech equipments. We are very grateful to Dr. Akash Saraogi. 

Post surgery: My recovery today, 2 months post bilateral TKR, is very good. He had prepared me for the imminent pain and I somehow knew what to expect. My heart keeps blessing him every single day (even on days the pain is very present haha). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Akash Saraogi and his hospital in Malad East.

Suggestions : Be prepared for it mentally as it is rough, especially if you plan on getting both knees operated together like me. Do not miss doing the exercises the physiotherapist shows. Only the exercises will make you capable of reaping the benefits of the procedure.",2024-02-18 06:47:59,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

 I'd like to specially mention that ,  his diagnostic skills are very methodical and precise. He makes you go through a series of light exercises and movements as a start to his diagnosis.

  The best part of the experience is how he nicely explains you in detail about the exact problem you are facing and the underlying cause behind it. This he does with the help of diagrams if its necessary.  You are left with no confusion as to the direction of the treatment along with the medicines involved. Very worth praising is his patience in explaining you, your problem in detail. 
  At any given point of time you don't feel rushed or at a lack of explaination.
