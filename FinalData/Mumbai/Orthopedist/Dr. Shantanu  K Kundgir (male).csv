Firstly the doctor said that they don’t accept Cashless and that I will need to get it reimbursed from practo. Also the plaster that he applied seemed a bit inflated cost wise. Earlier I was not being given a bill and was quoted 4400/- and when I insisted for a bill they hiked it to 4800/- with no break up of costs of plaster material. The date was also marked incorrectly on the bill whereas it was correct on the prescription.
