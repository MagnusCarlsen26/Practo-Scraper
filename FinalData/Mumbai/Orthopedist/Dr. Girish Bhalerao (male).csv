"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"My mom was suffering with arthritis for last 15 years and she was reluctant to get her knees replaced. Her non-medical expert friends (largely housewives)  kept on brainwashing her about the failure ration of knee replacement surgery. You will be surprised to know that non of her expert advisers had ever encountered knee issues / surgery and still they continued to preach about the threats, risk and failure ratio of such surgery. 

My mother's knee issue went on aggravating and had reached a stage were she almost stopped walking, the gap between two knees increased from few centimeters to almost a feet, her knee pain started taking toll on her hip, ankles and spine. Pain killer pills had its own issues. In all her situation was deteriorating at a very fast pace. 

The situation was worsening day by day till the time we met Dr.  Girish Bhalerao from Wokhardt Hospital Miraroad. His mesmerizing positive attitude and confidence impressed all of us including my mom and she finally got convinced for the surgery.

 Dr.  Bhalerao ensured that he explained each and every aspect about the line of treatment and gave us sufficient time for clarifying our doubts. Have met so many doctors in the past and this was the first time that some body actually cared about our silly queries and concerns. Must admit that the doctor was a thorough professional and was brilliant in his  specialized skills. He recommended a cost effective treatment and also ensured that unnecessary overhead costs are eliminated. While checking reviews about the doctor i learned that he is associated with various international institutes and has largely worked in international space on knee and spine related ailments. 

Few reason why one should consult with Dr.  Girish Bhalerao:

1. Years of experience in knee and hip replacement both in India and Abroad.
2. Follows international standards and protocols while treating patients 
3. Invests time in explaining each and every specification with the patient and relatives. 
4. Has positive reputation in market 
5. Honest and Genuine doctor 
6. Commits and delivers with 0% deviation
7. Down to earth and humble person 

In all we are very happy with the doctor, line of treatment and the hospital. Today after 1 month of surgery my mom is able to walk without any support, she can bend both her knees to almost 70 degrees against 140 degrees (earlier).  She walks almost 1kms per day and manages to exercise without any external intervention. Gap between both the knees has reduced to few centimeters against a feet. The complex surgery looked simple to us only because we had one of the best doctor standing by our side. 

My sincere thanks to Dr.  Girish Bhalerao for being such an outstanding professional, who helped us in steer through the medical situation smoothly.

I had a knee injury and couldn’t bent my left leg, I consulted few orthopedic doctors but could not get better or got convinced of getting operated until I met Dr. Girish Bhalerao.
After the consultation the dr. explained me every detail of what had happened to my leg and what surgery would I require to get back to my original strength. He is so confident with his work that I wanted to get operated immediately.
I was so confident in the doctor because he uses every possible means to take out the fear of a patient and directs you to the truth and gives you correct informations. He uses 3D structures, 3D videos and videos of actual operation to explain everything. And behaves very calmly and joyful in situations.
On the day of operation I was guided and explained everything nicely. It was the best hospital visits ever in my life because it didn’t had anything to fear.
