For a new born baby and new parents its very difficult to understand certain problems with the new born baby. Why he is crying so much, does he has some pain or sm other problem.my baby cried entire night as he had got sm infection and fever and suddenly vomits after every feed.i called  Dr. Tiwari early morning 7am and he  was available and answered my phone call and suggested the possible cause. Which many drs dont do. Firstly other drs are not available when u need them.and so early morming and late night they dont reply to ur cal or msg. Bt Dr. Tiwari is available on Watsapp to answer ur query related to ur new born baby at late night also. This has really boosted our confidence in Dr. Tiwari. And will definately recommend him to my frends nd other family members for their new born baby. \nHe is the only hope when u dont understand whats wrong with ur baby. ******* * **** **** *** ",

Which many drs dont do. Firstly other drs are not available when u need them.and so early morming and late night they dont reply to ur cal or msg. Bt Dr. Tiwari is available on Watsapp to answer ur query related to ur new born baby at late night also. This has really boosted our confidence in Dr. Tiwari.

I have called him at really odd times whenever there was an issue with my 2 year old, and he has always responded very promptly. His tone is always that of concern and he is very patient with his patients and their parents. The best part about him is his follow up. Not too many doctors will call you later to check how the kid is doing but Dr Abhinav does. His assessment and his treatment, both are impeccable and impressive. \n\nHe is a great doctor and more importantly a wonderful human being. I would recommend him strongly to all the parents. Thanks Doc for all your help.",

My son usually gets nervous whenever a visit to doctor is there but this time he was excited seeing doraemons all around the walls and forgot about the doctor visit.  Dr.  Abhinav was very friendly during the checkup and overall consultation of my son. I am overall satisfied with the consultation and medical advice given by him and have surely added his number as my child's specialist.",
