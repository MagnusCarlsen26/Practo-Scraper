We reviewed your visit which was yesterday; you had come in asking for only vaccine administration. You then proceeded to spend half an hour in the consulting room discussing the feeding schedule, the vaccines that were to be administered, the bathing of the child, and in general the rearing of the child. This is what constitutes a consultation for your baby from a pediatrician.
If you wanted only vaccinations, you should have brought in a list of vaccines that you wanted to be administered and say, please administer these vaccines. You cannot ask for vaccines that are due at eight weeks of age. The knowledge and expertise required to determine which vaccines are needed at a particular age are what you pay for in a consultation.
I understand that you would like to reduce the cost and who wouldn't? I suggest the following ways:
You could buy the vaccines from a friendly neighborhood chemist and get It administered by any doctor who is willing to. We do not administer vaccines brought in from outside, because we want to ensure that the vaccine is stored in perfect circumstances and we go to great lengths to maintain the cold chain that vaccines require. We even have a dial thermometer that checks the temperature inside the refrigerator where we keep the vaccines. We maintain electronic medical records and send out reminders to our patients for vaccinations due. Almost all our patients genuinely appreciate it.
A better option is to take it from the municipal hospitals. You chose to interpret it as sarcasm, but it was in good faith. Here, the cold chain is assured, and on the cold chain, depends the effectiveness of the vaccine. This is a far better option than the previous one.
We realize that it is not possible to please everybody. We wish you all the best in your search for a cheap and effective vaccine and hope that your child a healthy future",2019-02-27T16:22:02+0000,Dr. Neeta Nathani

You have visited us last year at which time a list of age-appropriate recommended vaccines were given to you and a discussion about why they were necessary took place. You elected to take only influenza vaccine for your child, which is to be taken every year. This year you came back for the annual flu vaccine visit and inquired about which other vaccines have to be given.
We reviewed your file and said that the same vaccines that were advised earlier were recommended even now. It is unfortunate that you interpreted our recommendations as an attempt to scare you. Our job as a pediatrician is to make recommendations for vaccinations and treatment as per standard worldwide guidelines. Most of our patients take this advice in good faith and act upon it. They remain reasonably healthy. We are all different, some of us interpret recommendation as an attempt to scare someone. And that is OK too. Finally, the onus of accepting well-meaning advice that is given in good faith rests with the parent.
