My son was admitted for one weak and he was diagnosed for viral fever after one weak it got relapse, so I didn't go to Surya again, my family doctor told me after he injected antibiotics and all during admission period but after discharged they could have been continued with oral antibiotics but they didn't have prescribed to the patient so that's why the bacteria may not have completely wiped out but it relapsed for some reason. I know Surya hospital is well known so visited I would like to recommend the doctor, I am happy with the explanation of health issue only thing is they could have suggested oral antibiotic after being discharged there was only one syrup was given I think they left some testing part and all, my son both hands were paining, so I didn't went to the hospital, I know Surya hospital is well known for paediatric I think they have to come a little bit higher level side to diagnosed properly and systematically.",

I know Surya hospital is well known so visited I would like to recommend the doctor, I am happy with the explanation of health issue only thing is they could have suggested oral antibiotic after being discharged there was only one syrup was given I think they left some testing part and all, my son both hands were paining, so I didn't went to the hospital, I know Surya hospital is well known for paediatric I think they have to come a little bit higher level side to diagnosed properly and systematically.",
