"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Angioplasty and Stenting,",0,0,YES,I went to the doctor for my father's angioplasty. His angiography done at other hospital showed major blockages in heart vessel. He explained us the problem very nicely and also explained us the procedure of angioplasty in a very simple language. This reduced our anxiety about the angioplasty procedure. After the angioplasty my father's chest pain has completely disappeared. The doctor also helped us by reducing the overall cost of the procedure to a large extent (the charges quoted at many of the other hospitals was out of our budget).
