I had went with my  MIL for her chest pain issue . She was suggested tests which were carried out in Indigo hospital itself. The facility is good.She is feeling fine after taking medicines and all.
But,she had history of low sodium level and she was hospitalised for same reason before. 
The sodium check report was yet to come and we were  assured that it would be shared on whatsapp .
We anyways had appointment a day after with another specialist  in same hospital and we thought if sodium Level issue is there then we will get it on WhatsApp and we can take a call to visit our old doctor if required in between before the appointment.
But we were told to collect report from the hospital itself and Indigo hospital didn't shared report on WhatsApp.
I found it to be weired because now we cannot do anything till we actually receive the report.
