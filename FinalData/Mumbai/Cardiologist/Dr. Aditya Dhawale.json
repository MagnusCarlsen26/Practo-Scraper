His approach is very holistic and he tries to work up a solution from all dimensions. His medications worked like magic for my grandparents. In case of emergencies he is also available directly on his mobile number. I would highly recommend Dr. Aditya to anyone looking for an excellent cardiologist. Keep up the good work doctor.",
