I was relaxed after the consultation. And his fees being a cardiologist was on particularly lower side which shows he cares about people and is committed to his profession. God bless !!",

I had informed you that the ECG is normal and you were asked to step out as your consultation was completed and we had to complete the sanitization of the clinic before the arrival of the next patient. All medical tests are reported in medical terminologies and the patient are usually told whether it is normal or not. All charges are already displayed in the waiting area and on practo. I still apologize if despite all my sincere efforts you did not have a satisfactory experience.",

His assistant did my ecg, he had to take 2 reports because his machine had some issue. After the report he said its normal and asked me to step out of his cabin. His assistant came with the reports and gave it to me. When i had some doubts about my reports about things written on it, ** *** ****** *** said its written in medical terms you wont understand and asked me to leave.

I had informed you that the ECG is normal and you were asked to step out as your consultation was completed and we had to complete the sanitization of the clinic before the arrival of the next patient. All medical tests are reported in medical terminologies and the patient are usually told whether it is normal or not. All charges are already displayed in the waiting area and on practo. I still apologize if despite all my sincere efforts you did not have a satisfactory experience.",

His assistant did my ecg, he had to take 2 reports because his machine had some issue. After the report he said its normal and asked me to step out of his cabin.
