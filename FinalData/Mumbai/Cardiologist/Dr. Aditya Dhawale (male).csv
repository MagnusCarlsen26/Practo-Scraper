None,None,0,0,YES,I first came to know about Dr. Aditya through a friend. My grandparents both have heart problems. In the first consultation itself he makes you feel very comfortable. He gave us sufficient time to speak and understood the problems. Dr. Aditya will also explain you the situation in a language that a common man can understand. His approach is very holistic and he tries to work up a solution from all dimensions. His medications worked like magic for my grandparents. In case of emergencies he is also available directly on his mobile number. I would highly recommend Dr. Aditya to anyone looking for an excellent cardiologist. Keep up the good work doctor.,2021-05-03 11:56:03,False,True,Samkeet ,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,Because of adverse work life balance I had developed issues with my cholesterol levels. I was totally confused with how to deal with the situation and was not able to interpret the reports. Dr. Aditya Dhawale came to my rescue and really helped me to sail through the issues with flying colours. For the past two years I have followed his diet and exercise regimen and I have not only improved my health but I have become so fit that I wake up daily with renewed vigour. ,2021-05-03 16:01:19,False,True,Sharat Uchil,,,
