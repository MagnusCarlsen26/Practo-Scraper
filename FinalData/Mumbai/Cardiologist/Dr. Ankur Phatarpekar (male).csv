"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I am a senior physiotherapist who has practiced for 43 years in several hospitals across South Mumbai. In this review I would like to summarize my excellent experience with cardiologist, Dr. Ankur Phatarphekar. I have had two consultations with him at his clinic for preoperative consultation on 2D-Echo and ECG tests. The first one was before my laser ablation procedure earlier this year, and for the second time, more recently, prior to my upcoming carpal tunnel surgery.
 
We often hear about fears of patients undergoing cardiac procedures like angioplasty and angiography. I too was apprehensive about my tests, and worried about a dire outcome. Throughout the assessment, the doctor assured me and explained in detail on what to expect. My assessment was thorough and I have been declared fit for surgery next week! Assuring the patient and explaining regarding the conditions, without exaggerating the problems is a critical part of patient care. Dr. Ankur was meticulous in his assessment, with attention to detail and clarity of assessment/ explanation.
 
In spite of having a heavy load of patients, Dr. Ankur was able to give adequate attention to patients, without the quality of treatment being compromised. He is a humble doctor and possesses a calm temperament. My years of experience as a physiotherapist is able to give me a unique perspective in patient care, and I was thoroughly satisfied as a patient at Dr. Ankur’s cardiology clinic. In Mumbai, we surely need cardiologists like Dr. Ankur who keep our hearts healthy and excel in patient care thus leaving a patient feeling assured.
 
To summarize, I give Dr. Ankur P. an “Excellent” in patient care, detailed assessment, perfect diagnosis, correct advice, and a great attitude. I express my gratitude and thankfulness for his time. I wish him all the best in his flourishing career!
