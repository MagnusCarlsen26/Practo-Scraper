"Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Surgery,Dental Cavity Filling,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I recently had an appointment with Dr. Shah at the dental clinic and I couldn't be happier with the care and attention I received. From start to finish, Dr. Shah and her team were professional, courteous, and incredibly skilled at what they do.

One of the things that stood out to me about Dr. Shah was how thorough she was in explaining the procedures he was going to perform. She took the time to answer all of my questions and made sure I understood what was going to happen during each step of the process. This really helped to alleviate any anxiety I had about the treatment.

During the actual procedure, Dr. Shah was gentle and precise, ensuring that I was comfortable throughout. She and her team made sure I was completely numb before starting any work, which made the entire experience painless.

The clinic itself was clean and modern, with state-of-the-art equipment that made the entire process much more efficient. The receptionist was also very friendly and welcoming, and I felt at ease as soon as I walked through the door.

Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Shah and her team to anyone looking for a dentist. They are professional, skilled, and genuinely care about their patients. I feel confident that I am in good hands with Dr. Shah and look forward to my next appointment.
