None,None,0,0,YES,"I was searching for a cosmetic dentist for a bit as my wedding date was nearing and thankfully, found Dr. Ankita Gehi. She went out of the way to make my smile designing experience so positive and painless. The moment I stepped into Aakaar dentistry, I was greeted and treated with friendliness and professionalism. The clinic is aesthetically inviting, but she and her staff are what makes the dental experience there top-of-the-line. Be it Invisalign treatment, zoom teeth whitening or a regular cleaning, she’s been my go to person since then. Her honest suggestions and extensive experience has made me trust her completely for my family’s dental health as well. I recommend all the brides to visit her for a beautiful, confident smile. Highly, highly recommended. ",2024-06-07 10:04:05,False,True,Disha Gul A,,,
