Over the period of time, the teeth fell off one after the other. We have consulted at least 3 dentists including Dr Aaditi Mahajan. We decided to go ahead with Dental implants as the treatment explanation was in detail and Dr answered all our queries with a lot of patience. Got 9 implants done in total, 4 upper and 5 in the lower jaw, all done in a single sitting. Process was quick, painless. Treatment charges were reasonable.",

Surprisingly Dr called me instantly and asked me to visit her clinic in morning. Got my OPH done on the same day. She opened her clinic at 12:30 pm just for me, usual time was 4:30 pm. Not only she did a brilliant job and should thorough professional while removing the wisdom tooth but she called me everyday for next 4 days to enquire about my pain and to check how well I am responding to the treatment.

But the anxiety & apprehensions due to my low threshold for pain & post operative healing on account of the diabetes put me off for several years. Till I consulted Loop Dental & Dr. Aaditi Mahajan. Her cool confidence & assurances that she can achieve the impossible put my mind at rest & at last I took the plunge. On 1st October 2021, Dr. Aaditi extracted the painful & decayed wisdom tooth with such ease and expertise that I was amazed! \n\nHats off to Dr. Aaditi & her team. I would without hesitation recommend her to family & friends for any of their dental issues. Dr. Aaditi, I truly appreciate your effort. \n\n- Chris Jude",

Over the period of time, the teeth fell off one after the other. We have consulted at least 3 dentists including Dr Aaditi Mahajan. We decided to go ahead with Dental implants as the treatment explanation was in detail and Dr answered all our queries with a lot of patience. Got 9 implants done in total, 4 upper and 5 in the lower jaw, all done in a single sitting. Process was quick, painless. Treatment charges were reasonable.",

I was in severe pain and on Friday night, I just pinged Dr Aditi on WhatsApp at 1:30 am just to convey the severity of my pain. Surprisingly Dr called me instantly and asked me to visit her clinic in morning. Got my OPH done on the same day. She opened her clinic at 12:30 pm just for me, usual time was 4:30 pm. Not only she did a brilliant job and should thorough professional while removing the wisdom tooth but she called me everyday for next 4 days to enquire about my pain and to check how well I am responding to the treatment. I can say that you can only get such care an professionalism when you are passionate about your profession. Thank you doctor!",

But the anxiety & apprehensions due to my low threshold for pain & post operative healing on account of the diabetes put me off for several years. Till I consulted Loop Dental & Dr. Aaditi Mahajan. Her cool confidence & assurances that she can achieve the impossible put my mind at rest & at last I took the plunge. On 1st October 2021, Dr. Aaditi extracted the painful & decayed wisdom tooth with such ease and expertise that I was amazed! \n\nHats off to Dr. Aaditi & her team. I would without hesitation recommend her to family & friends for any of their dental issues. Dr. Aaditi, I truly appreciate your effort. \n\n- Chris Jude",

The current situation requires utmost sanitization. Loop Dental clinic is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before and after every patient is treated. I had a tooth extraction which was executed painlessly and also my recovery was monitored by the clinic through messages.\nNowadays very rarely do you come across such wonderful experience at any clinic. I am happy and really satisfied by the service provided at Loop Dental Clinic. Thank you Dr. Aaditi for this wonderful experience!",

I just went one day and met doctor Mrs Aditi for consulation. \nDuring that I came to know that my teeth are damaged and I have to undergo root canal treatment.\nThen I have undergone treatment and ceramic cap was placed on my teeth.\nTreatment is done in a smoothly without any pain to other teeth.\nRates were also very economical.\n Timing for my appointments are made flexible and changed based on our availability. Bills for treatment  generated are authentic.\n\nI would suggest people in near by chembur can visit and get necessary treatment in time.",
