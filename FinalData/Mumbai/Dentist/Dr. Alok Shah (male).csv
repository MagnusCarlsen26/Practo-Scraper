"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Just got a Root Canal and Cleaning done and a few things really impressed me so I thought of writing this:

1. I had a really bad toothache and it was the mid of the Covid pandemic.. and even though Dr. Akok has a 1 yr old kid and kept his clinic shut then, went out of the way and opened up cuz he realized the pain I was in...

2. It was my 3rd root canal.. first with Dr. Alok and trust me, it was a breeze. Root canal treatments are bound to give you some pain and discomfort but here, I just didn't feel an ounce of pain. (I hate toothache so well this really mattered to me!)

3. Another small but noticeable thing, Dr. Alok takes you through the journey by constantly talking to you, keeping you informed ofnwhat exactly he's doing and how that helps.. it's a really small thing, but just makes the overall experience so unique and pleasurable...

On the price front, his charges were pretty much the same I've paid everywhere..
