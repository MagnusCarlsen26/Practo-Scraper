The enthusiasm with which he operates makes it very clear that he loves what he does. As a result of this he has a perfectionist's approach to his work.\r\nHe's one of the few doctors i've met who takes the effort of explaining every single step of the treatment to the patient. This way you know exactly what he is planning and feel actively a part of the process. \r\n\r\nI have a lot of dental issues and have visited over 5 dentists in the last 4 years, most of them look for quick/ temporary solutions to problems. Dr. Poplai, on the other hand, suggested to me upfront that i should look for a permanent solution, even if it means waiting a little longer. \r\n\r\nUnlike most dental clinics, his clinic in Bandra is large, airy and beautifully done up. There is always soft music playing in the background, hence one does not feel the usual nervousness/ claustrophobia experienced at most clinics. \r\n\r\nThe technology he uses is state of the art. In my case (invisible braces), brackets were specially designed to fit my teeth as one single piece by a Chinese manufacturer. \r\n\r\nHis clinic staff is extremely warm, well trained and professional. They send regular alerts and reminders for appointments.\r\n\r\nIt's very important for a patient to form trust and a certain comfort level with a doctor. Dr. Poplai makes it very easy for this to happen. He takes his work very seriously and wants the best results as much as you do. One feels a lot of ease around him as he knows exactly what he is doing and does it with a lot of confidence. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dentist, i very strongly recommend Dr. Gaurav Poplai\r\n",

The place was well done up and gave a cozy feeling. On examination I was told that I would require a Root Canal. The Root Canal was done in a single sitting the next day and was fortunately painless. I was also given a crown within a week. I must say that Dr. Gaurav Poplai handles the clinic with a lot of personal care. Seeing the professional attitude I also decided to get bleaching of my teeth done. Overall this was a very good experience. ",

Pretty hand on there.\r\nI had been to other doctors who did there best to scare me. Dr Gaurav simply gave a sunscreen and asked not to use anything else and said that he will try things/ treatments to resolve the problem. He tried a chemical peel( did not really work), then I got the laser done and waited for the after effects before posting the review. Its done perfectly without any scar, side effects, the issue is halfway resolved( need another session though).\r\nThe other aspects are as follows:-\r\nComfort level - high\r\nExpense - was worth the results\r\nClinic - Clean and nice\r\nStaff and follow ups- Great!\r\nLocation- Quite easy to locate in Bandra West\r\n",

The enthusiasm with which he operates makes it very clear that he loves what he does. As a result of this he has a perfectionist's approach to his work.\r\nHe's one of the few doctors i've met who takes the effort of explaining every single step of the treatment to the patient. This way you know exactly what he is planning and feel actively a part of the process. \r\n\r\nI have a lot of dental issues and have visited over 5 dentists in the last 4 years, most of them look for quick/ temporary solutions to problems. Dr. Poplai, on the other hand, suggested to me upfront that i should look for a permanent solution, even if it means waiting a little longer. \r\n\r\nUnlike most dental clinics, his clinic in Bandra is large, airy and beautifully done up. There is always soft music playing in the background, hence one does not feel the usual nervousness/ claustrophobia experienced at most clinics. \r\n\r\nThe technology he uses is state of the art. In my case (invisible braces), brackets were specially designed to fit my teeth as one single piece by a Chinese manufacturer. \r\n\r\nHis clinic staff is extremely warm, well trained and professional. They send regular alerts and reminders for appointments.\r\n\r\nIt's very important for a patient to form trust and a certain comfort level with a doctor. Dr. Poplai makes it very easy for this to happen. He takes his work very seriously and wants the best results as much as you do. One feels a lot of ease around him as he knows exactly what he is doing and does it with a lot of confidence. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dentist, i very strongly recommend Dr. Gaurav Poplai\r\n",

The place was well done up and gave a cozy feeling. On examination I was told that I would require a Root Canal. The Root Canal was done in a single sitting the next day and was fortunately painless. I was also given a crown within a week. I must say that Dr. Gaurav Poplai handles the clinic with a lot of personal care. Seeing the professional attitude I also decided to get bleaching of my teeth done. Overall this was a very good experience. ",

Dr Gaurav simply gave a sunscreen and asked not to use anything else and said that he will try things/ treatments to resolve the problem. He tried a chemical peel( did not really work), then I got the laser done and waited for the after effects before posting the review. Its done perfectly without any scar, side effects, the issue is halfway resolved( need another session though).\r\nThe other aspects are as follows:-\r\nComfort level - high\r\nExpense - was worth the results\r\nClinic - Clean and nice\r\nStaff and follow ups- Great!\r\nLocation- Quite easy to locate in Bandra West\r\n",
