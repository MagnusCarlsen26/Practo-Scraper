This context communication was really helpful to me. Through his diagnosis/evaluation, he recommended me to undergo maxillofacial surgery to fix implants/steel plates to take care of fractures of the zygomatic bone.    \n\nHe was genuinely concerned about the plight of the patient (pain, psychological trauma, surgery scars on the face, aftereffects of surgery, etc.), while performing the surgery he made sure to have minimal scars on the face and having the stitches inside the mouth. During the hospitalization phase (before and after the surgery), he visited me multiple times to make sure that progress was as per the plan.",

Nobody can escape the pain in the beginning, but with the right guidance and communication with doctor it was very easy and painless, for a person like me I'm super scared of needles, and I'm way to skeptical about everything.\nI found my go-to dentist, I would highly recommend to visit there, the equipments, hygiene, technology is top notch and it's quite reasonable too. The sleight of hand of Dr Ankesh Jain is mind-blowing, you'll enjoy the process without any worry. ",

This context communication was really helpful to me. Through his diagnosis/evaluation, he recommended me to undergo maxillofacial surgery to fix implants/steel plates to take care of fractures of the zygomatic bone.    \n\nHe was genuinely concerned about the plight of the patient (pain, psychological trauma, surgery scars on the face, aftereffects of surgery, etc.), while performing the surgery he made sure to have minimal scars on the face and having the stitches inside the mouth. During the hospitalization phase (before and after the surgery), he visited me multiple times to make sure that progress was as per the plan.",

Nobody can escape the pain in the beginning, but with the right guidance and communication with doctor it was very easy and painless, for a person like me I'm super scared of needles, and I'm way to skeptical about everything.\nI found my go-to dentist, I would highly recommend to visit there, the equipments, hygiene, technology is top notch and it's quite reasonable too. The sleight of hand of Dr Ankesh Jain is mind-blowing, you'll enjoy the process without any worry. ",
