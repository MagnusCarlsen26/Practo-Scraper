I was always scared of getting braces and postponed it until I was 22. I was referred to the clinic by a friend of mine and it turned out just as lovely as my friend promised for it to be. Dr Shruti jayson explained me all the types of braces and I was convinced for invisible braces as it is quite comfortable and  requires less time...I felt invisible braces are awesome .. Just got done within a  year  treatment and the difference is quite amazing. I'm not someone who usually recommends places but this is a place that I can happily recommend to all of my friends!
