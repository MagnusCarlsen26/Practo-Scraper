I was terrified of the procedure however, was inspired by his calm and confident demeanor when he said it\u2019s simple and all will be well. It took me a good 20 minutes to convince myself that I had to get it done and the rest is history! \nThe timing of the entire procedure mentioned to me was on point but more than anything, I really appreciated the way Dr. Manish handled me in that stressful situation. Even after the procedure, he kept answering all my questions right down to the silliest ones, even on his birthday, what a blessing he is!!\nI will definitely recommend Dr. Manish to everyone not only for his expertise in the dental space but also because he really lives up to his mantra of \u201cSpreading Smiles\".\n\n\n",

It took me a good 20 minutes to convince myself that I had to get it done and the rest is history! \nThe timing of the entire procedure mentioned to me was on point but more than anything, I really appreciated the way Dr. Manish handled me in that stressful situation. Even after the procedure, he kept answering all my questions right down to the silliest ones, even on his birthday, what a blessing he is!!\nI will definitely recommend Dr. Manish to everyone not only for his expertise in the dental space but also because he really lives up to his mantra of \u201cSpreading Smiles\".\n\n\n",
