"Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,NO,We had visited for RCT but doctor advised for Deep Cleaning saying that problem will get solved and we went for two sittings and paid fee *** **** ********* *** finally we had to go for RCT elsewhere ***** ****** *** ********,2020-01-26 04:47:32,False,False,Verified Patient,"Appreciate your feedback. As we had discussed in your first consultation, the best course of action at the time was deep cleaning as your symptoms involved pain across multiple teeth and gum bleeding. And in case the same did not work, then only to do root canal treatment( RCT). Our intention is always to try to save the tooth without conducting an invasive procedure like a RCT. Sorry if you felt dissatisfied with the recommended course but we had your best interest in mind. Happy to know you are pain free now and please do feel free to let us know if we can help in any way. Take care.",2020-01-27T17:16:13+0000,Dr. Meeta Malik
