1. Very friendly and puts you at ease very naturally, very professionally.

She quotes a fee for the treatment, inclusive of all multiple sessions that may be required for completion of the treatment. 
3. Doesn't recommend further action until she is sure what is required (in my case, wait for all sessions of cleaning+polishing, before evaluating for cavities and further course of action)
4. Of course my experience with the actual treatment has also been good.
