"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Oral Rehabilitation,",0,0,YES,"“Elevated” is the word that first come to my mind as soon as I entered the clinic.
Extremely clean, hygienic and serene – was the environment inside the clinic.
I had visited Gums and Braces for consultation for full mouth for my father.
I believe “punctuality is the sole of profession“ and was very impressed by their commitment  towards time. We were taken in apt ON TIME. 
They had asked us to fill a form which asked for our details, our problem, medications etc. Thus they knew about us before we even meeting them and they can check accordingly.
As soon as we entered,  the doctors were all set and ready to examine. 
Both the head doctors – Dr. Sneh and Dr. Tuhina – are extremely calm and friendly.
They closely examined the entire case, explained us the situation, the various options that would be possible and also told us the factors that should be seen while selecting the options. They were able to communicate it so lucidly that it helps a common man to understand the problem and then make a sound and informed decision. 
We can easily make out – that for them – patient’s convenience and his satisfaction with the treatment- are the 2 sole objectives.
We are looking forward for the balance part of treatment with them….

FROM enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis and increasing patients knowledge - TO - maintaining a good patient’s -doctor’s relationship , AND as being one stop solution for all your dental problems -  GUMS AND BRACES EARNS MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION !!!
