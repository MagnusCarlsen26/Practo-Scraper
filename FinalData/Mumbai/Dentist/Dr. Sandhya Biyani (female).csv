We humbly apologise for any negative feelings you felt during your treatment and any inconvenience caused.

In terms of medical treatment, we showed you intra oral pictures of your teeth taken before starting any treatment. As there were deposits on the teeth we recommended you get scaling done. You confirmed this treatment plan on discussion with your mother.

Once scaling was done, with clearing of deposits, a cavity was found in your tooth, again whose pics were taken and informed to you. Again you conferred with your mother and confirmed the treatment of cavity by filling. 

We hope both these work were to your satisfaction. Also we have maintained all pre op and post op pics, we request you and your monther please visit us as per your convenience. We would like to again personally explain to your mother your treatment plan for her satisfaction.

If you want, we would like to also discuss your treatment plan and pictures of your teeth with another dentist of your choice so that you can have a second opinion.

Request you to understand that at all points before starting any treatment we reconfirmed our prices with you. You also confirmed the prices with your mother. We assure you that we maintain full transparency in our prices and we are extremely sorry you feel this way. Kindly please visit us with your mother so that we can explain our side and hope to satisfy you.
