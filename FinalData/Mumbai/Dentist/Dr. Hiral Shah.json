My Son was very anxious about the appointment and any procedure, but She was very patient with him and the staff was very helpful and kind. Dr.Hiral Shah is very professional and reasonably priced. She takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. It's not easy to find a good dentist for your kids. I feel I received honest advice and trusted my dentist's opinion here. I am so glad I chose Hello!Tooth and would highly recommend to anyone.",

My Son was very anxious about the appointment and any procedure, but She was very patient with him and the staff was very helpful and kind. Dr.Hiral Shah is very professional and reasonably priced. She takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. It's not easy to find a good dentist for your kids. I feel I received honest advice and trusted my dentist's opinion here. I am so glad I chose Hello!Tooth and would highly recommend to anyone.",

We got your feedback and we have checked the same in detail to identify the issue..First of all we at Hello Tooth always ensure that our patients are treated with utmost care and parents also should be satisfied which is the philosophy at our clinic..As we read your feedback we would like to inform you that doctor herself always explain treatment / cost factor before any treatment starts so that there is no ambiguity later which normally every parent has for their own kid..We checked our records where we always take undertaking of kids parent/ guardian where entire treatment and cost is also mentioned including anaesthesia as well..You also mentioned about local anaesthesia which is normal and it was not emergency case and you could have changed your decision at any point of time in case if you felt. However as mentioned we follow our protocols clearly to ensure all parents are satisfied but however we  would request you to get in touch with Doctor at any point of time to have more clarity on your query and we assure you once again that at Hello Tooth we are very clear and transparent in terms of treatment as well as charges.
