"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Surgical Tooth Extraction,Dental Fillings,Dental Cleaning,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"To begin with I am one person who is extremely scared for carrying out any dental procedures . Because of my fear I have visited a dentist for the second time until the age of 32 and my last visit was over a decade back. Cause of negligence in visiting a good dentist I had multiple issues before I visited Dr Raunak. 

In my first 1-2 sittings I was very scared cause I knew I needed a root canal , a tooth extraction and few fillings. The best part of the whole thing is it’s been like overall 4 sittings so far and I am kind of through with fixing most of my dental issues. 

Right in the consultation sitting Dr Raunak explained to me what were the issues with my respective teeth. He not only explained me what procedures were required but he actually kept me updated on real time basis while he was performing the procedures so as to what exactly was he doing.  

I always regarded dental implants to be the most scariest thing because it’s like extracting a tooth first drilling inside the bone and fixing a screw.  Had it not been the encouragement and confidence from Dr Raunak I doubt I would have ever done an implant in my life . 

Be it my root canal, implant, extraction, fillings, cleaning all went extremely smooth.

Dr Raunak and Dr Surena manage things skilfully they perfectly know how to educate their clients they ensure client satisfaction is given upmost priority.  The staff working at their clinic are very cordial and caring.
