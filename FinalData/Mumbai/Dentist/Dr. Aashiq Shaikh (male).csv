"Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,NO,Absolutely terrible experience. I wouldn’t recommend anyone going to Dr. Aashiq at all after the experience I’ve had. I went to him because i had severe toothache due to an unfinished root canal done by my previous dentist. I was given 2 options of either extracting the tooth or attempting a re-root canal by the dr after looking at an x-ray that he took on the spot.

I was prescribed anti inflammatorys and a painkiller ******* *** to be taken 3 times a day for 5 days. These 5 days were the most painful days of my life.

Your previous doctor had broken an root canal cleaning instrument right at the apex of your tooth root while doing root canal procedure which definitely will cause you pain whether we prescribe antibiotics or not. 
We clarified this right at the time of consultation itself and gave you two options whether to extract or to give it a chance and save it. We mutually agreed to at least try and save it thinking it might work with your consent of course and explained you the possible pros and cons clearly.
What does informed consent mean?
Unfortunately your pain didn’t subside as we had expected. So as discussed at the consultation appointment the other option was the only thing left to be implemented i.e extracting the tooth.
And this is what informed consent means.
But this option didn’t go down your throat when the time arrived for it. You shouldn’t have agreed upon for it at the first appointment itself and denied any sort of treatment at our clinic if you were not ready to get the tooth removed if the first option doesn’t work.
You being a smart clever and well educated girl such a puerile behaviour was not expected at all especially after discussing each and every detail before hand.
As far as medications are concerned the doctor had cleared his stand on that day itself that until and and unless the source of infection (i.e the broken instrument) is either removed or bypassed completely or disinfected effectively the infection will recur again and again periodically ultimately transforming into a big abscess which might hurt you even more may be not today but surely some day later. This is what more than 13 years of experience of our expert doctor concludes.
Instead of thanking the doctor that he tried to save your tooth that too without even charging his fees for it, you are inappropriately recommending others not to go to him? He himself even personally messaged you the following day when the procedure was performed to know about your wellbeing. But you and your father didn’t even show any respect for the doctor. That proves your immaturity and arrogance anyhow.
We are practising in this city since 13 years and encounter a lot of good calibre and high profile cases daily so performing treatments without prior consent is not at all our preference no matter whatever the situation would be. We never ever compromise on the standards and quality for that matter and we even charge for it extra if needed. 
We have tons of patients walking in and out but None of them have ever complained such a thing in past except you in these years.


Having said that we still hope the best for you in future and pray to Almighty for your complete recovery soon 😊

Aashiq was really very great as he is very friendly and joyfull kind of a person but at the same time very professional. I had never thought that visiting a dentist would be so much relaxing and comfortable. The doctor was kind enough to take time and listen to my problem calmly.
He explained to me in detail about the problem that occured in my tooth which was paining horribly, and he provided a permanent solution for it. He performed root canal treatment without any pain. And moreover i liked his concept of not grinding the tooth just to place a cap or a crown instead placing emax onlays was a way much more better option. And i am happy and feeling much relieved after the treatment now. He restored my tooth back almost like nothing had happened to it ever. The ugly decayed tooth is now looking as good as natural tooth.

No wonder folks don't take preventive care. ",2021-01-01 17:19:27,False,True,Verified Patient,"Thank you for the appreciation. We at Digital Dental World strive hard to provide our patients the best quality treatment with international standards.

As far as the exorbitant cost is concerned we would prefer to improve our treatment standards day by day rather than degrading it just to be economical. We encounter patients of that calibre who need quality and painless treatment with modern techniques and world class precision. 
And moreover your tooth was already root canal treated way back and was badly mutilated which would have required surgical intervention otherwise. Fortunately it was removed with the normal method.
But still we would surely take your suggestion on a serious note and try to improve in future.
Thank you 😊",2021-01-31T02:50:24+0000,Dr. Aashiq Shaikh
