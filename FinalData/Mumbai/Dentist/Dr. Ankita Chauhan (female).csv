Working with Dr. Abhishek is always a pleasant experience with him END of Story Dr, Abhishek J.The Diastemata Second Step or  I can say The whole procedure apart from Frenectomy Which is done by Dr.Ankita. I still remember when they called me to visit there clinic to see me and click my tooth picture as part of dentistry. So I Went into their clinic and was greeted by a very friendly staff and felt comfortable through the entire process. Within my first visit I knew this office would be my primary dental office. From the receptionist, dental assistance, and the doctor- I felt like a valued patient. They both  knew I had a bad fear so  they talked me through the whole thing and made me laugh quite a bit to lighten the mood Not just for people who are very fearful of getting dental work done like myself, but also because they both is a Grade A professional at their craft.Dr.Ankita ** *** **** ** ********* *** has a great team of family and staff. They are all top of the line professionals, with superb workwomen ship, artistry and state of the art equipment. A lab on site, and TV/DVD for his/her patients to watch while waiting, or just to relax, if they wish. They have other Hi-Tech equipment, as well, to achieve a precision alignment, which goes hand in hand with that perfect smile. I Was having poor teeth for about 15 years. She has transformed all of my ugly teeth into a beautiful smile.my teeth look better now, than when I was 25. I thought there was no hope, unless I spent a fortune. Their fees are very reasonable, and affordable for all incomes, and She will work with you. She is very caring, compassionate, and patient with a desire to make her patients happy with their results. Dr. Ankita is also very good with children, and has a way of making them calm and relaxed. She will always be my dentist, and even though I will be living hundreds of miles away, I will fly or drive to SHARAN Smile Dental, for all of my dental needs. If you need quality work, at an affordable price, then you need to call Dr. Abhishek or Dr.Ankita to set up an appointment. You will thank God you did. I do every day....Thank you so much!

Thank you Dr. Ankita  for the great experience and quality work you have done on my teeth. I am usually apprehensive about needles and it was no sweat at all. In fact, I am ready for the next needle, thanks to your gentle touch. My family and I have been pleased with your professional, yet personable, service.
