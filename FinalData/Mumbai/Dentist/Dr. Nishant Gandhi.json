And all that stood true when I received his treatment myself. \n\nDr Nishant Gandhi is amiable and makes you feel comfortable during the treatment and understands your concerns readily. He also tried to be friends with my 3-year-old nephew who accompanied me at my first visit just so that my nephew feels comfortable in the new environment. Dr Gandhi has the latest healthcare technology and equipments available at his clinic which makes the treatment journey quite smooth and less time consuming. Thank you, Dr Gandhi!\n\nMs. Helen at the reception is extremely helpful and accomodating to your schedules and concerns. She is indeed brings in positivity to the entire treatment experience. She keeps a good follow up to the treatment. Very sweet lady. \n\nThe other assistants, staff, technicians are courteous and professional.\n\nThe ambience of Dr Gandhi's clinic is calm and pleasant. Waiting time is very less at the clinic; and even if you have to wait for 5 minutes, that is not an issue at all because the clinic environment is serene.",
