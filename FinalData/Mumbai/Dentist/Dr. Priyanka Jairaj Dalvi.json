Admittedly, I was nervous  -  wisdom teeth are notorious, and mine was badly decayed!  However, Dr. Priyanka's expertise immediately put me at ease.\n\nShe clearly explained my options, recommending extraction due to the tooth's position and condition.  Despite the challenges, Dr. Priyanka skillfully extracted the tooth in one piece, minimizing discomfort.  I felt practically nothing, even after the anesthesia wore off!\n\nThis is a stark contrast to the horror stories I've heard about wisdom teeth. Dr. Priyanka's skill and gentle touch have completely eliminated my fear of dental extractions.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Priyanka is now my go-to dentist for all my dental needs, and I highly recommend her!

From start to finish, Dr. Priyanka and the entire staff were incredibly friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.\n\nDuring my consultation, Dr. Priyanka took the time to listen to my concerns and answer all of my questions. She explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and made me feel completely at ease. I never felt rushed or pressured, which was a refreshing change from some other dentists I've seen in the past.\n\nThe tooth cleaning itself was also fantastic. The hygienist was very gentle and thorough, and my teeth felt so clean and fresh when I left the office. The whole process was quick and painless, and I really appreciated that they took the time to explain everything they were doing along the way.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Dr. Priyanka and his team to anyone in need of dental care. They truly go above and beyond to provide top-notch service, and I'm so glad I found them. Thank you, Dr. Priyanka and team, for a wonderful experience!",

Despite the challenges, Dr. Priyanka skillfully extracted the tooth in one piece, minimizing discomfort.  I felt practically nothing, even after the anesthesia wore off!\n\nThis is a stark contrast to the horror stories I've heard about wisdom teeth. Dr. Priyanka's skill and gentle touch have completely eliminated my fear of dental extractions.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Priyanka is now my go-to dentist for all my dental needs, and I highly recommend her!

With my old Crowns I was always so self-conscious when I smiled that I was always smiling with my mouth closed. I am confident in my new smile given by you and love showing it off.   My only regret\u2026 I wished I had not waited so long .\nThe one thing that was most impressive to me was the fact that                            Dr Priyanka Shirodkar and the whole team made me feel so comfortable and everyone was so nice. I have never felt uncomfortable or afraid to ask any questions. They took the time to answer all my questions. I would recommend Dr. Shirodkar's Family Dental Care  to all my friends and family.\n",

She explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and made me feel completely at ease. I never felt rushed or pressured, which was a refreshing change from some other dentists I've seen in the past.\n\nThe tooth cleaning itself was also fantastic. The hygienist was very gentle and thorough, and my teeth felt so clean and fresh when I left the office. The whole process was quick and painless, and I really appreciated that they took the time to explain everything they were doing along the way.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Dr. Priyanka and his team to anyone in need of dental care. They truly go above and beyond to provide top-notch service, and I'm so glad I found them. Thank you, Dr. Priyanka and team, for a wonderful experience!",

The implants were done somewhere else and that dentist had given up and had said nothing can be done now. Dr. Priyanka came to the rescue and treated her with utmost care. The treatment of infected implant was done using Lasers.\n\nThe services are excellent and follow-ups are scheduled in a timely manner.

Completely painless no cuts no swelling no stitches and faster healing, better results. Dentist was just outstanding and informative. She took time to explain every procedure she was doing. Dr Priyanka did a great job, I felt that I was in good hands. She made me feel right at home and as if I was a friend. She provided excellent service, proper follow ups and I will be coming here for all my future dental needs! \nThe best\u00a0dental care\u00a0I have ever experienced!
