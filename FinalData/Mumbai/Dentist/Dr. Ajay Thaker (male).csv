  We at, Smiles Royale,  are extremely sorry to hear about your issue after getting the treatment done from us. I assure you to resolve your issue provided you inform us about your problem and visit our clinic. In recent times, we do not recollect any of our patient reporting back to us after his/her treatment with this kind of complain or else, in so many years of our practice, we have never let any patient suffer in pain, if he/she has got the treatment done from our clinic. 

  But, I still assure to resolve your issue if you report back to us and there would be absolutely “No Fees” charged till the time you are pain free in case there is any deficiency from our side. 

 Also, let me take this opportunity to explain that there can be multiple  reasons post treatment due to which some pain and/or discomfort may arise, like if the tooth already was very badly infected and we still tried to save it, or  a possibility of a cracked tooth which sometimes is not seen clinically as well as radiographically, or some high points in the crown, or if it’s the second last tooth and the last tooth (Wisdowm tooth) is impinging on to the treated tooth, and many such issues due to which the patient experiences such kind of pain. Such issues can be diagnosed only if you let us know about your problem and report back to us.

 We would be glad to help you out of your pain and see to it that you are completely pain free. 

Regards, 
Dr. Ajay Thaker.

And the patient is simply asked bluntly to wait for longer even after 40 mins wait time.",2023-12-12 08:01:11,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hello My Dear Patient of 10 Years, 
   No one was blunt in informing you that the patient ahead of you was in pain and was to be treated more than her usual time allotted. You were appointed just a day prior in between the 2 already appointed patients just because you had personally requested even though it wasn’t an emergency we accommodated you. 

  And there is ought to be a wait time which is difficult to predict in terms of amount of time that is required to complete a particular case considering so many factors like patient’s pain, addressing their fears and whatever queries they may have till their satisfaction levels.

 Any treatment given to a patient can’t always be time bound as we are not just treating a tooth/teeth but basically treating their psyche as well !! 

 So, I would again very humbly request you that if at all there is any wait time at any Doctor’s waiting room rather than getting irritated do try to understand the fact that a Doctor is trying His/her Best to take care of a patient who is in some sort of trouble and there is nothing against anyone else who is in the waiting. But, on the contrary, you should be glad that the Doctor  is so caring that he/she will give you equal attention to your problems when its your turn.

 And lastly, let me thank you for providing me an opportunity to genuinely explain my inability to take up patients on time on some occasions as ""Dentistry"" is all about ""Art"" of  not just treating patients but its about treating patients to their levels of  Expectations and Contentment and for that We need to devote good amount of our Time and Energy.  
  Also, I know for sure that  you too were always glad in this last decade post all your treatments and we never gave you any reason for worry post treatment. One odd day shouldn't change the strong bond that exists. 
God Bless. 😇",2023-12-15T17:32:18+0000,Dr. Ajay Thaker
