When it gets painful or sensitive we tend to find a dentist and we remain scared of the treatments. \nI always thought that there can be nothing wrong till it is not paining. I found denstists scarier and all treatments painful, Even the sound of the instrument would irritate me and the treatment chair would  scare me to death. \nI am very happy with diagnosis and treatment provided \nI had a bad case of dental cavities, plaque, and decay which I was not even aware. I was explained well and treated upon with patience. Doctor adjusted my appointments as per my erratic work schedule and accommodated my request of Sunday visit \nI am writing this review post 3 months of my treatment and after achieving due satisfaction. \nI had a liberty to call the doctor and explain my issue over phone too. I do not think these days any other doctor would be so dedicated and would be so helpful. \nIf you want peace of mind and value for any of your dental treatment you can be assured with Dr Rachna Bhama",

I flew into India with my 3 n half year old daughter Monique especially for her appointment at Smilestones with Dr. Rachna.  It was Monique's first time ever dental visit and naturally I was scared how Monique will deal with it and I didn't wanna leave disappointed and both my fears disappeared the moment I met Dr. Rachna.  Dr. Rachna made Monique feel at home.  Dr. Rachna was playful with Monique so she had Monique in her trust and confidence. Dr Rachna was very caring,  very professional, very patient and very co.operative throughout the entire procedure. Dr. Jeevan (owner of Smilestones) also helped Dr. Rachna to have Monique's attention. They played good team to make my visit complete success.  Monique at the end of the day was showstopper for her complete cooperation and patience and for that I have my big thanks to Dr. Rachna for her complete dedication and Dr. Jeevan to play parts in having Monique's on and off drifted attention. Monique left the clinic with 2 cement filling on her right grinders and 2 silver crowns on her left grinders. Moreover Monique left the clinic with big smiles and 2 bright stars on each hand and me with lasting inner peace. Smilestones definitely lives up to its name.  Biggg thanks to Dr. Rachna and Dr. Jeevan. ****** ******** *** ***** *** **** **** ******* ******  The impact you had on Monique was so beautiful and lasting.  She still thinks and remembers you as Dr. Aunty. ",

When it gets painful or sensitive we tend to find a dentist and we remain scared of the treatments. \nI always thought that there can be nothing wrong till it is not paining. I found denstists scarier and all treatments painful, Even the sound of the instrument would irritate me and the treatment chair would  scare me to death. \nI am very happy with diagnosis and treatment provided \nI had a bad case of dental cavities, plaque, and decay which I was not even aware. I was explained well and treated upon with patience. Doctor adjusted my appointments as per my erratic work schedule and accommodated my request of Sunday visit \nI am writing this review post 3 months of my treatment and after achieving due satisfaction. \nI had a liberty to call the doctor and explain my issue over phone too. I do not think these days any other doctor would be so dedicated and would be so helpful. \nIf you want peace of mind and value for any of your dental treatment you can be assured with Dr Rachna Bhama",

I flew into India with my 3 n half year old daughter Monique especially for her appointment at Smilestones with Dr. Rachna.  It was Monique's first time ever dental visit and naturally I was scared how Monique will deal with it and I didn't wanna leave disappointed and both my fears disappeared the moment I met Dr. Rachna.  Dr. Rachna made Monique feel at home.  Dr. Rachna was playful with Monique so she had Monique in her trust and confidence. Dr Rachna was very caring,  very professional, very patient and very co.operative throughout the entire procedure. Dr. Jeevan (owner of Smilestones) also helped Dr. Rachna to have Monique's attention. They played good team to make my visit complete success.  Monique at the end of the day was showstopper for her complete cooperation and patience and for that I have my big thanks to Dr. Rachna for her complete dedication and Dr. Jeevan to play parts in having Monique's on and off drifted attention. Monique left the clinic with 2 cement filling on her right grinders and 2 silver crowns on her left grinders. Moreover Monique left the clinic with big smiles and 2 bright stars on each hand and me with lasting inner peace. Smilestones definitely lives up to its name.  Biggg thanks to Dr. Rachna and Dr. Jeevan. ****** ******** *** ***** *** **** **** ******* ******  The impact you had on Monique was so beautiful and lasting.  She still thinks and remembers you as Dr. Aunty. ",
