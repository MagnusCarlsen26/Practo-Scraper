"Doctor friendliness,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Manish Agarwal for a wisdom tooth extraction. I was terrified of the procedure however, was inspired by his calm and confident demeanor when he said it’s simple and all will be well. It took me a good 20 minutes to convince myself that I had to get it done and the rest is history! 
The timing of the entire procedure mentioned to me was on point but more than anything, I really appreciated the way Dr. Manish handled me in that stressful situation. Even after the procedure, he kept answering all my questions right down to the silliest ones, even on his birthday, what a blessing he is!!
I will definitely recommend Dr. Manish to everyone not only for his expertise in the dental space but also because he really lives up to his mantra of “Spreading Smiles"".

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Gap Closing,Dental Crowns,Surgical Tooth Extraction,Wedding Smile Planner,Smile Designing,",0,0,YES,"Manish Sir, has been recommended by one of my cousin and he has been very friendly from Day 1.
Explains the whole process in Lay man terms and also provides exact vision of results.
My treatment is still under process (For Smile Designs) but this feedback is based on my last 4 sittings.

He has very soft hands with which, he keeps patients comfort at first priority.
Does what is really required and what will be best for you rather then just complete a procedure to make some monetary gains.

Until now I have undergone, Gum Trimming, Tooth Extraction, RCT, Dental filling and experience has been super satisfactory and comfortable.
That is a very Single reason i travel all the way from Pune to get my treatment completed in Mumbai.

Anyone can consult him without any second thought, you would really be satisfied.

Looking forward to complete my treatment plan for smile design.
