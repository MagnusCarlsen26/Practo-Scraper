Additionally, the post-operative care instructions you provided were comprehensive and easy to understand. Your attentiveness in ensuring that I had a clear understanding of the steps to follow for a speedy recovery was greatly appreciated. It is evident that you genuinely care about your patients' well-being beyond the surgery itself.
