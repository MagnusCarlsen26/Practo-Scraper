She went out of the way to make my smile designing experience so positive and painless. The moment I stepped into Aakaar dentistry, I was greeted and treated with friendliness and professionalism. The clinic is aesthetically inviting, but she and her staff are what makes the dental experience there top-of-the-line. Be it Invisalign treatment, zoom teeth whitening or a regular cleaning, she\u2019s been my go to person since then. Her honest suggestions and extensive experience has made me trust her completely for my family\u2019s dental health as well. I recommend all the brides to visit her for a beautiful, confident smile. Highly, highly recommended. ",
