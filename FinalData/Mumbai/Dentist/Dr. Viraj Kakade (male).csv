"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,"," Teeth cleaning & polishing,",0,0,YES,Doctor is very good and experienced. Gums were paining so much no today gums are very good and teeth are also good.,2024-06-16 03:51:20,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"Being new to Mumbai, I was very apprehensive about visiting a Dentist, as I was comfortable with only my former practitioner I have been associated with for years. Hence, when the need to find someone to fix a lost crown from an RCT arose, I was faced with a huge and tough choice to make. I am a very demanding and quality conscious person and when it comes to health, nothing but the best will do. I was looking for a great professional with work ethics that met all my requirements, topmost on my list was hygiene as you do not go to a Doctor to pick up an illness you do not have right?! 
After a lot of searching online, and an appointment I made and walked out on due to poor work ethics that instantly broke my trust, my daughter found Dent Heal. My search and all my fears ended here as Dr Viraj Kakade is a perfect professional and runs his clinic with great standards. Everything from fixing the appointment, to the consultation, the actual procedure and the advice for the future was done in the most comforting , clean manner with zero stress for the patient. 
I am certainly glad to have found him here, and also had the opportunity to meet his gentle and pleasant wife who is his professional partner too. I wish them a great future in all their endeavours and would safely recommend them to others in need of dental treatments.
