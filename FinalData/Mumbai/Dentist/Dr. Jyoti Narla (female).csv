Ans:It's not the tooth we treated 

Charged additional 500
Ans :500 for 2 X rays for new problem  of Enamel chipping and related sensitivity
But not charged for prescribing sensitivity toothpaste 

Food lodgement problem 
In  follow up in February visit we enquired about any issue with bridge for which u said it's fine 
If you have any problem please let us know first but we feel it is disheartening to read in reviews 

Cavities that got filled left the tooth misaligned 
Not a relevant question how can a filling lead to misalignment of tooth 

Cost 
If u had reservations about the cost there were cheaper alternatives in bridges and fillings 
Exact cost was 34500 for 3 unit bridge 9deep Cavities full mouth x ray, multiple small x rays and consultation 
Most of the Cavities treated were very deep and other dentists would have recommended Rcts for deep fillings 

All we say is if u do complain and it isn't sorted then u should be upset 

We feel sorry for ur inconvenience
