Of course, my daugther cried due to sound of the tools but within 5 minute of dental filling done, she was all Happy and playing. 

Her hand stability is superb. Infact seeing her handle my kid, i asked her whether she has done Paediatric dentistry but she hasn‚Äôt. She is definitely super and recommended when I have to advise someone for dental care.
