"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Nihar Thakkar happens to be one of the most Proficient Endodontists I have come across. He is extremely patient and kind and very dedicated to his profession. To have the kind of knowledge and expertise at such a young age is highly commendable. Despite mine being a very complex dental issue,  Dr. Thakkar clearly seemed to understand the problems and performed my Re-Root Canal Treatment successfully.
Dr. Thakkar's Clinic is absolutely clean and spotless and his treatment impeccable!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I had a great experience at Dr. Nihar Thakkar's clinic. During the procedure, he was supposed to give local anaesthesia and to be very frank I didn't experience excruciating pain and that was commendable. Also, during the entire surgery Dr. Nihar Thakkar and his assistant took care that I didn't have any kind of discomfort.
Also, soft soothing songs keep playing in background that makes you oblivious to the treatment.
