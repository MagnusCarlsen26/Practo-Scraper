Her clinic is extremely pleasant and clean. She makes a really good first impression and I got a very nice vibe from her. With doctors, at least for me, a good vibe is very important. I visited her for a shaky tooth. She took a look at my teeth and told me that at least 5 extractions need to be done. She said that she will further discuss my prognosis after an X-ray. I got back to her with an X-ray and she sticks to her prognosis, which are 6 extractions, 3-4 fillings and a re-root canal which has already been root canal treated before. After all the extractions, I would need dental implants, which she said would cost me 30-35 k per tooth. So basically, I would be visiting Dr Bhumika for the next 6 months - 1 year. Agreed, perhaps my dental health isn’t the greatest. But I got the feeling that her approach was quite radical. Money is one part, but the main concern here was if I really wanted to part with so many teeth, which weren’t really troubling me, except for the one that was shaking. So I discussed at home with my husband and we thought I should take a second opinion. I went to another dentist and told him the situation. He, unlike Dr Bhumika, examined each and every single tooth, poked and prodded them, asked me if I am experiencing some sort of pain, took an X-ray again. He told me that he would extract that shaky tooth superficially with just an anesthetic spray. He said that there is no need to surgically remove that tooth for now as it is deeply lodged in and when it comes out and troubles me, we can think of a course of action. As far as the remaining teeth - he said I need two more extractions maximum and he will try and save one, if he can but he won’t know unless he goes in. Lastly, he said I need only one filling and the tooth that has been treated with root canal only needs a crown and not a root canal again as it has been done perfectly well previously.  I am not from Bombay and I don’t have a family dentist here. I rely on a platform like Practo to choose someone and I completely went with all the lovely reviews she had here. I am still not saying she’s not an able dentist - just that you usually go to a dentist because your teeth is in bad shape and you want them to do everything they can to save them. For me personally, suggesting extractions straight away was extremely radical. Like the other dentist said, “even if the tooth was going to go bad in the future again, if I can save it for the next 10 years I will because you are relatively young.” Yes I am 33 years old *** ** * *** **** **** ********** * ***** ** ** ***** * ***** **** * *** *** ***** ",2018-11-27 02:54:11,False,False,vijetha rangabashyam,"Hi Vijetha, I personally feel that treatment of teeth should be long lasting and extraction should be a last resort.

Given my last wisdom tooth extraction experience which was quite painful (and with a long recovery time), I was extremely scared and hesitant to get another extraction.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"Honestly, these words will probably not do justice to the gratitude I feel for such a gentle, caring, sincere and brilliant health professional. 
I came to Dr. Bhumija after visiting four dentists in Mumbai, some of them with decades of experience. It was frustrating to keep going from door to door. But after my first visit at Dr. Nair's Clinic, I felt her consultation and diagnosis was far more thorough *** ******** compared to what I had previously received. 
The RCT on a broken and complex tooth condition required several visits including a gum surgery and to Dr. Bhumija's credit, she has been as thorough, sincere and consistent with her brilliance through the month and a half long treatment which is now complete. She was so patient through the whole process, never once rushing to complete the treatment. Further, to top it all, both the temporary and permanent crowns fit perfectly in the first try itself! I don't think you will come across anyone more sincere out there. Dr. Nair proceeds with a one pointed focus, and that is to make sure you get what is absolutely the very best for you. So if you don't need an extraction, be rest assured she will save your tooth! And if your tooth and gums need time to heal before the next stage of your treatment Dr. Bhumija will ensure that everyone sits back so the healing can take place. Cheers to you Doc!

None,None,0,0,YES,"I was in pathetic pain and was suffering from the same from past 1 week. However, the image and fear which I have for a Dentist in my mind (coz of my past experience) was the main reason coz of which I haven't visited any dentist to get rid of the paid. But when the pain became unbearable I had no other option but to search for one via of course internet. I must say that I was lucky enough to get her number on google. 
They understood the urgency and gave me immediate appointment. In one appointment within 10 minutes exact problem was explained to me in a layman language so that a patient can understand the same quickly. Second appointment was for removal of wisdom too affected with cavity and everything went well. Next appointment's were for cleaning and polishing teeth. I must say one thing, these guys are very punctual which is the main thing for a working professional like us. All the time I visited her clinic between office timing and the process was completed within due period of time. The staff is also very polite and ask for water the moment you enter the clinic.
I'll recommend Dr Bhumija to everyone if you need a doctor with proper solution and polite personality that too with punctuality.

She understands the fear and anxiety that people come to dentist with and starts her treatment there. She makes you comfortable enough and informs you of all procedures very systematically. She encourages questions and answers till you understand them. I have had a lot of dental issues and I have met dentists who looked at me like I'm a gold mine or are least bothered to address my fears about the procedures. But Dr. Bhumija is amazing. She genuinely cares about you. I have done everything from cleaning to fillings to root canals to re root canal to gum surgery to extraction. And every procedure was almost painless and comfortable. She is also very open to feedback. 

Moreover I had a time frame to work with as I was moving to the US. She finished my treatments on time, structured my appointments well. She values your time and is very accommodating. 

Her clinic is clean and nice. What more? She has a fantastic taste in music. She puts up instrumentals of rock song and pop songs and I once heard a cello cover of the Game of Thrones. Brownie points because she likes Lana Del Rey who is my absolute favorite. She played it once on request when we were doing a difficult procedure to help me relax. Guessing which song is playing is a great past time while treatment is in progress. There also some cute and pun-ny comic to keep fear at bay.

Moment you think about wisdom tooth extraction, first thing comes to your mind is needle, pain, surgery, swelling, etc etc. Though it's all natural, still I was little apprehensive about choosing my dentist. But then I came across Dr. Nair's Clinic through Practo, just opposite my residence. There I met the dentist Dr. Bhumija Nair. She took the time to explain the issues I had and then she explained me the procedure she is going to do. Everything went very well, post which I was at little ease and less worried. Not only that, she goes above and beyond the call of duty, she did keep a check if I'm having any issues post surgery. I found her to be excellent, very Professional as well as truly caring. Thank you Dr. Bhumija Nair for the great experience and quality work you have done. Now I'm pretty sure about getting my other treatments done at Dr. Nair's clinic only.
