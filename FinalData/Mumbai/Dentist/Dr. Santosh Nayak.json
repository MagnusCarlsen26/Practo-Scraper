He is meticulous and thorough in his approach, ensuring he never misses anything that needs dental attention, but is at the same time mindful of each patient's needs and constraints, and manages to work around this to the benefit of each individual.  I was very fortunate to have been refered to him through a close friend and have been very pleased with the diagnosis, advice and treatment received - not just for me, but my family as well. A million thanks for taking care of us Santosh!!!",

I sincerely thank him from bottom of my heart for being very patient and doing a wonderful job . I am sure he knows exactly how to treat his patients well and do the right job with  minimum expenditure to the patient. I appeal to each one of you about his excellence in dental work and also his humble and polite nature towards his patients . God bless you my dear son and may he bring you lots of success in the coming years . ",

He is meticulous and thorough in his approach, ensuring he never misses anything that needs dental attention, but is at the same time mindful of each patient's needs and constraints, and manages to work around this to the benefit of each individual.  I was very fortunate to have been refered to him through a close friend and have been very pleased with the diagnosis, advice and treatment received - not just for me, but my family as well. A million thanks for taking care of us Santosh!!!",

I came across Dr Nayak few days back  and I happen to ask him what best he can do for me . Doctor suggested me to opt for a new denture . I readily agreed as the doctor showed lots of confidence in his words,However my new denture was ready in a weeks time and I was very much comfortable with new dentures given to me at a very reasonable cost . I sincerely thank him from bottom of my heart for being very patient and doing a wonderful job . I am sure he knows exactly how to treat his patients well and do the right job with  minimum expenditure to the patient. I appeal to each one of you about his excellence in dental work and also his humble and polite nature towards his patients . God bless you my dear son and may he bring you lots of success in the coming years . ",
