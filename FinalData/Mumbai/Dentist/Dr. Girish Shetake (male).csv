If patient has anatomical difficulties to work inside mouth ,we have to apply few barriers and suction to complete the treatment.  For this we prefer daytime appointment .As u could not manage your appointment during day time, it was difficult for us to give enough consoling time during night appointments. 
Anyways as we have completed the root canal treatment , you can continue your treatment with other dentist . You can contact anytime if you need any case records . We ll be happy to see you in future .
