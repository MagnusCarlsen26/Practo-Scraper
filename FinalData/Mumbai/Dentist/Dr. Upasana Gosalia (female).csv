None,"Cavities,",0,0,YES,"Dr Upasana was very patient and comforting. I was getting cavities filled for the first time in my life - that too, four of them. And she made the whole process seem so simple and painless. I was relaxed the whole time and she informed me of all the steps she was performing beforehand so there were no surprises. 

This is my second visit to her - the first one was a couple of months ago for a dental cleaning. Even on that occasion, especially because it was the first time in my life I ever got any dental procedure done - I started off feeling very nervous. But after meeting Dr. Upasana and talking about the procedure, I felt very calm and relaxed throughout. 

Dr. Upasana is very friendly and kind, unlike most Doctors who are very dismissive and hurried. She is also very knowledgable about her profession and is open to answering all kinds of doubts - even those that don't concern the specific treatment that I was undergoing.  

She also isn't very stern about payments - my best friend got a set of braces done from Dr. Upasana's clinic and she didn't demand the full payment in advance. She has allowed my friend the option of pacing out the payments over several months. This can be very handy for people who have a cash flow issue but also have severe dental problems.
