"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,I was having pain in teeth muscles so I consulted DrAtul. He initially gave me medicine for pain relief which worked but not for longer time. I had pain in Upper tooth muscles which was causing great difficulty while eating specially roti. My tooth location is beside wisdom  tooth. We discussed as I was finding great difficulty in eating solid stuff so Dr Atul suggested me to wear Splints they are like cap which are to be worn only when we sleep. Yes there. was a option also for tooth extractio. but it wasnt permanent solution as our teeth are connected with many nerves so its not always assured our problem will get solved after extraction and moreover motto was to save teeth of Dr Atul which he succefully has done. Splints is nothing but nightguard for your teeth so your muscles are relaxed and we are pain free.Inmy case it was not so easy to operate and settle issue as it was upper teeth which arent so easy to operate. I went to other doctors they said we can remove wisdom tooth and see whether problem gets solved of which i was not sure as my wisdom tooth was no where in pain.Dr Atul suggested for the nightguard which is to be worn thereafter permanently but believe me this thing has saved my teeth from surgery or any such niot so sure ways. Yes i too got suggestion for braces and retainers from other doctors but thats time consuming and more expensive I Was in need for some effective and quick solution so i can start eating normally. I would recommend in my case it wasnot so easy to even speak for few days. Dr Atul has given me a treatment of splints which i have to wear daily and forever but most important moral from my case is DR Atul has saved my teeth . by reading ull can understand it wasnt a normal dental condition but if we have such efficient doctors who believes in preventing my teeth and curing by just wearing night guard then i feel its highly recommended to look for such solutions as old is gold and hold till we have such effective dental experts. By reading ull may feel i have easily eqipped with splints but believe me i can now eat all stuff of which i got restricted due to pain. Thank you for reading.

I had explained in detail to you because I don't want you to go through unnecessary dental treatment.
Suggested you to wear that device known as ‚Äòanterior deprogrammer‚Äô which is a diagnostic tool as well as a treatment appliance to be very sure that your pain is of Muscle Origin and NOT the Teeth (as commonly happens) as the X- Ray also suggests. I asked you to use it for a week and give me feedback. Hence I have NOT even charged you in advance for the treatment - have told you fees will be taken ONLY AFTER you feel relief from pain which I‚Äôm confident of as this has worked in several of my other patients. In fact this simple device called anterior deprogrammer has relieved many patients from terrible migraines & spondylitis. 
It's not even a day since you are wearing it so I request you use it for a week atleast before expecting results in such a chronic case. In case of any issue please feel free to call me anytime. If you are still unsure this appliance won‚Äôt work you may return it back to me.",2018-10-04T15:07:51+0000,Dr. Atul Indurkhya
