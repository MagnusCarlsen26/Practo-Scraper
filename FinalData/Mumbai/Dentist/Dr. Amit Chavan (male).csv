"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Artificial Teeth,",0,0,YES,"The last place I ever wanted to visit was a dental clinic simply because of the fear and pain I might have to go thru, be it cleaning, extraction or setting my broken teeth right. 
Post two months I can clearly say I was proved wrong in my assessment simply because the warmth extended by Dr Amit Chavan and Dr Lubaina Tapia and their team of professional assistants who made me feel at home while undergoing the treatment.
My treatment which involved cleaning, extraction of two teeth (never knew when it was pulled out ðŸ˜Š) and the modification of the teeth to prepare for the bridge was smooth, painless, and clean. Kudos to Dr Lubaina who is a thorough professional at her work, understand the patientâ€™s requirement and treats accordingly. 
During the initial consultation with Dr Amit Chavan he took me through the entire process involved in setting my teeth right, and I thought it was great in terms of giving me the much-required confidence.
Overall a superb experience and my gratitude towards Dr Amit Chavan, Dr Lubaina Tapia and the team of assistants who took care of me and gave a fantastic experience and more importantly removed the fear in me in the first sitting.   
Thank You once again to give back my SMILE ðŸ˜Š

I was initially apprehensive about receiving dental treatment outside of my home country. However these fears were allayed as the facility is a modern and well equipped centre. Dr Amit examined and concluded that I needed a root canal filling but would need to be done at a later date in order to commence with some prep.
I attended the second session to commence the root canal filling, dr Hitesh carried out this part of the treatment. The thouroness of the work was fantastic and I had minimal/no pain during this period.
The the next part of the treatment was to insert.the cement onto the filling and complete the root filling, this was carried out by Dr. Lubaina and she was excellent in doing this phase of the treatment and also explained the work being done and also advices on the nest stage that needed to be done, this was to place a cap on the filling. Unfortunately I was unable to have the cap inserted to to my insufficient time in Mumbai.
I would like to thank Drâ€™s Amit, Hitesh, Lubaina and all the wonderful supporting staff.
I would have no reservation in recommending Dr. Amit and his team for dental care.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Crowns,Dental X-Ray,Laser Gum Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Amit and Dr. Lubaina were wonderful both as doctors and people. They were extremely patient and very accommodating. 
I went for a Root canal and aching tooth. Which went perfectly, no questions asked. Looking at the comfort I felt in their dental care I opted to change my other crowns. They did a very thorough replacement of my old filling before changing the crowns.

They even accommodated my requests when I had to leave urgently and wanted to prepone my treatment.
I would have given them a hug and a thanks if not for Corona.

I would highly recommend them at Smile Again Dadar East.

Infact the nurse staff are also wonderful and were extremely welcoming. 

A big thanks to everyone.",2021-02-04 08:40:04,False,True,Omkar Samant,,,
