"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Denture Problems,",0,0,YES,"First of all I say Many Thanks to Ambika Ma'am. I am staying at Mira road & Believe me I was suffered some chronic burning sensation & fungal infection, tooth paining issue. Even sometime inside cheeks have some rashes. I was very scared about this symptoms and went to visit at local doctor who is BHMS. At first time when we meet BHMS doctor He said that you have OSMF & need to take care & required weekly base B12 Injection is necessary. I started his medicine & took only 1 injection on same day. After 3-4 days passed still no improvement then I visited to BDS Doctor at locally & He said you don't have any OSMF symptoms.
He examined all things and Said You have suffering HSV virus & He prescribed 1 Month Medication. I was completed his course but still after 1 month my mouth burning & other symptoms was same. Again After 1 month medication I have meet him, He said need to be done full mouth X ray for better examination. I did it, & I am surprised When we meet again to BDS doctor with X ray Report. He replied that I am Sorry to say & apologies that You don't have HSV virus but nothing to worry. I asked him that earlier you was too confident and was said its HSV Virus symptoms & Now 1 month Passed and I have completed your one month medication course. Now you said it's not HSV then what is it ? BDS doctor again confused and said it might be asymptomatic reason & no any medicine in science also. If no any improvement in next 10 days then will do biopsy for testing. At that movement I literally depressed because I don't know need to be consult with which doctor ???? I feel that I should be consult with MBBS/MD doctor & I took the appointment. He asked me some few question that Do you have you any tobacco habit Or any other../ said Yes but it's not too much. He replied that might be its some serious infection in mouth But not sure. Let's take 10 days medicine & then will check. I was started his medicine as well but no improvement & conclusion on this. One day somehow I come to know that Oral and Maxillofacial doctor is best for oral related issues. I searched on web & found Dr. Ambika Tiwari Ma'am. The clinic location at Chembur which is far from Mira road but I took her appointment & visited her clinic.
Believe me, I had feel too much relax when I meet to Ambika Ma'am. The reason is that she examine my mouth & listen my all queries very calmly and said you don't need to take tension & She offered me to take one glass of water because at that period i was in tense. She calmly & confidently said Due to fungal infection that white lesion are appeared on your tongue & due to toothless space that jaw pressure has created at one side & the inside of the cheek is accidentally bitten by some other tooth Due to this reason such injury happened in inside cheeks area. So Need to fixed tooth on that place on priority. I was immediately get it done & tooth fixed work done by Dr. Ashish Tiwari Sir. He given nice treatment & fixed my tooth perfectly.
I really thankful to Dr. Ambika Ma'am & Dr. Ashish Sir ! Very humble & nice human being. They nicely explained the root cause of issues & not prescribed unnecessary medicine.
