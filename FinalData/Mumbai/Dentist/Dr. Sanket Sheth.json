He was rushed immediately to Dr. Sanket Sheth's clinic, his staff and his associate, Dr. Kajal Bhanushali, immediately took the patient in for investigation, and noticed one teeth was broken and the other tooth fractured. She immediately performed the procedure to relieve the pain and set the teeth with a splinter, within the golden hour. And this has resulted in the broken and fractured teeth recovering and showing signs of sensation of heat and cold with the splinter now removed after a week. We thank Dr. Sanket Sheth and his associate, Dr. Kajal Bhanushali, for their quick thinking, emergency procedure/ treatment, on time and with the assurances and cofidence of a recovery, and guidance on the progress, precautions and next steps. We strongly recommend Dr. Sanket Sheth and Dr. Kajal Bhanushali are glad we approached them and the treatment could be performed in time and with the regular follow-up, hope to have full recovery of the teeth.",

He was rushed immediately to Dr. Sanket Sheth's clinic, his staff and his associate, Dr. Kajal Bhanushali, immediately took the patient in for investigation, and noticed one teeth was broken and the other tooth fractured. She immediately performed the procedure to relieve the pain and set the teeth with a splinter, within the golden hour. And this has resulted in the broken and fractured teeth recovering and showing signs of sensation of heat and cold with the splinter now removed after a week. We thank Dr. Sanket Sheth and his associate, Dr. Kajal Bhanushali, for their quick thinking, emergency procedure/ treatment, on time and with the assurances and cofidence of a recovery, and guidance on the progress, precautions and next steps. We strongly recommend Dr. Sanket Sheth and Dr. Kajal Bhanushali are glad we approached them and the treatment could be performed in time and with the regular follow-up, hope to have full recovery of the teeth.",
