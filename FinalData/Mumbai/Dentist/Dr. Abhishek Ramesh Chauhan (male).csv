"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Implant Supported Denture Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I had consulted dr Abhishek for  an implant supported Denture case for my mother who is 70 years old. Doctor Abhishek and his team were very efficient and the entire ecosystem at Sharan hospital is very well designed to efficiently cater to patients. He was very patient with all our naive queries, was very knowledgeable and guided us with great care right from choosing the right denture to getting the implant in place. He would stretch beyond his consulting hours to personally tweak the denture and ensuring my mother tried it multiple times until she was completely satisfied with the fit. He showed great care and love as he dealt with this elderly patient. My mother was very happy with his behaviour and care . I would highly recommend consulting Dr Abhishek. *** ** *** **** ******** * **** *** ** ******************",2020-12-10 17:43:53,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
