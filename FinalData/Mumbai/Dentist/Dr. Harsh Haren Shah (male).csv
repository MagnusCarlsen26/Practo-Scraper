"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental X-Ray,Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Harsh Shah is an experienced and registered Endodontist meaning he has specialized in Root Canal Treatment.  Dr. Harsh has done my Re-RCT because I had a bad decay after an old RCT. It was so bad that other doctors would have removed my tooth and it wouldn't cost much. Dr. Harsh has taken all the measurements of my tooth to save it. He has cleaned all of my canals and completed it explaining each possible step that he is performing so that I remain informed. Sir is well aware of what are my pain points in and around the tooth, so while treating he informs me before hand. 
Doing Re-RCT took me 2 sessions (according to my convenience) due to my tooth complexity and it involved multiple X-rays. I get a reminder of my appointments so that I don't miss out the procedure. I would recommend doctors like Dr. Harsh to all of my friends and relatives just because of his communication and experience. These two things makes him stand out.
