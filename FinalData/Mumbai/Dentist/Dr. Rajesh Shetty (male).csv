In fact the Doctor was kind enough to let me choose between General Anaesthesia or Local Anesthesia depending on my preference.
Once the day of the surgery was decided, i received  confirmatory calls/messages from the clinic.
On the day of the surgery, the Doctor was very reassuring and ensured that I was comfortable, especially since I had opted for the procedure to carried out under LA.
During the entire surgery the Dr. checked on me to ensure that there was no pain and that I was at ease throughout.
After the surgery all the post-surgical precautionary instructions and necessary prescriptions were given. 
I received messages/calls immediately the next day from the clinic inquiring about my well being.
The Doctor also called me for a follow up to check on how the healing and recovery was happening.
The reason I have been so descriptive is because of the extremely positive and professional experience that I have had throughout my treatment.
