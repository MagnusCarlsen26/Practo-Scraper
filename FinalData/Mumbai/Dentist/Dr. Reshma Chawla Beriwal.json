I still remember my mom use to scold me very day to visit for a dental check up but I used to avoid it because I was not that confident to visit dentist as not able to find a good dentist. \n\nI recently completed my dental treatment at Blanco Aesthetics. i have a lot to say about it. Firstly the ambience of the clinic is very soothing and you feel very comfortable there. High quality treatments providing great value. Utmost care and covid-19 precautions are taken over there. No doubt about it. \n\nHad a great great experience for my 7 tooth filling\u00a0 with Dr. Reshma. It was completely painless I did not realise when the treatment was done. Wonderful staff and ambience. I strongly recommend getting dental treatment to be done here.\nNow talking about\u00a0 Dr. Reshma *** ** **** ************* *** explains each and everything before the treatment like what the whole procedure will be. The treatment is completed skillfully. Totally worth it. It was my first visit and sure will be visiting in future too.",

The best part was that i actually liked going to Blanco Aeshetics- because its not a typical scary dental clinic. really positive vibes and sweet well mannered staff. Thank you Dr Reshma and team. ",

I was so excited to get a smile makeover after seeing few influencers and celebrities reviewing them. I trusted these reviews and met Dr Reshma Chawla for it and she was so nice initially. They followed the Covid protocols which was a boon. \nDr very calmly explained the procedure and suggested me a DSD to have a look at my smile and whether it suits my face before it gets finalised by me which was quite exciting. Like I could see how my face would look with my new smile before the procedure. ( 15,000 /- ) \nDr never showed it to me. I completely trusted her. I did ask her many times as to when can I see my DSD and she said I am doing that only. I was in so much irritation and pain already that I trusted her completely. All through my procedure Dr was very calm and patient. I really did like her then. Just before my procedure was going to get done, she did advice me to wear retainers (10,000/-) so that my teeth don\u2019t shift in the long run. This wasn\u2019t told initially. \nDuring the procedure, I went through bearable pain but after the procedure got done that\u2019s when the real pain started. It was unbearable. I had my wedding in a weeks time and I was on painkiller althroughout suggested by Dr .Though My smile looked ravishing. This pain killer isn\u2019t right for those who are pregnant which the Dr didn\u2019t tell me then and told me later on. As she knew I am going to get married and could conceive too. But whenever I told her about the pain, she would tell me have as much painkillers you want. My honeymoon was spoiled because of the unbearable pain. Luckily I had only one pain killer. I was on painkillers for nearly a month after the procedure got done. It was so terrible, the sensitivity went to another level and I was out of station so only the pain killer would help me. Suddenly the pain vanished and it was seriously a blessing. But why did this pain happen at the first place ? My lower canines were hitting my upper teeth. Which hurt my gums, jaws and head. Infact full face. That\u2019s when my husband asked me didn\u2019t the Dr show you the smile before you got it done and the answer was NO.. So when I came back to Mumbai , I visited her asap with my husband where she said I needed a cleaning asap and we got done the next day or in a day or two ( 2,500/- ) We even asked her then whether DSD was done and she said a Yes. So can we have a look at it and she very confidently said yes shall give it to you right away which she didn\u2019t.  On the day of the cleaning I asked her again and she said we have to get it from the lab and coordinate with her staff for it. I got done with my cleaning. \nThe teeth looked so nice and shiny  and initially also during the procedure she had done the same but the effect wasn\u2019t the same at all. I asked her then too after cleaning why are my teeth still yellow, dirty and she said \u201c It\u2019s \n like this only \u201c \nSecond time was much better unlike the first time. * ***** **** **** ******** *** **** ********* * \nI kept asking one of the clinic helper ( staff ) for the DSD and she kept saying Dr hasn\u2019t given it to her yet. After few days ,I went to the Dr to take my measurements for the retainers and asked the Dr again for the DSD very politely and she literally yelled at me \u201c ASK THE STAFF \u201c I was so stunned as to suddenly the sweet nice Dr changed lol \nThe staff said it will take few more days. \nThat\u2019s when I knew she hasn\u2019t done it and charged me 15,000/-. I trusted her so much and even told my brother and friends to visit her. My brother did get his treatment done with her much before all this drama. Now the real drama begins. She very well knew she hasn\u2019t done the DSD, so now what will she do ? \nShe very well knew I was pregnant. I just confirmed pregnancy ( in one of her treatments ) and that\u2019s when I asked her about the painkiller and she said I can\u2019t take it during pregnancy.  She didn\u2019t even mention this before and luckily I had stopped taking the painkiller much before I conceived. \nNext day she calls me up ( very sweetly ) and tells me I am talking ill about her to the other patients and scaring them ! When I started questioning about which patients and asked her for more details. Her statement changed and  then she claimed one of her patient heard me talking ill about her to my mother. I have done such a major procedure from her ( Almost 3,00,000/- ) and I very well know I need her for the rest of her life and will I  have the audacity to talk ill about her in her own clinic ?\nShe accused me for something which I haven\u2019t done. Making me so furious and agitated. She very knew I am pregnant *** *** *** **** ******** ** ***** *** I clearly asked her forget all this and give me my DSD which she had no answer. She thought by accusing me with trash, I will forget about the DSD. Then I asked again , she said in 2-3 days shall give you. Why so long ? She had No answer. \nAfter lots of arguments she accepted her mistake and decided to give me a refund. Which I did get but the procedure was hideous. As my husband didn\u2019t want me to take any tension over this. He knew how much I liked her. Further conversations were done by my Husband and her , where she sent him terrible voice notes of her patient saying she got scared by my conversations with my mother and the person who was on the voice note didn\u2019t even know English properly, so I wonder what did she even understand what we were talking. It was just something without validation which proves nothing. \nEven the clinic helpers would literally plead you for a review from the beginning. How can one give a review so soon ?\nDr completely spoiled the relationship with us and we can\u2019t trust her one bit. \nWe can\u2019t visit her anymore. \nEven the retainers for the lower teeth do not fit properly, it\u2019s long and hitting my gums and same was confirmed by another dentist in Hyderabad. I won\u2019t be able to go back to her because the relationship is gone forever but definitely I am at loss after getting done with such a major procedure by her.\nI visited a reputed Dentist in Hyderabad and Dr told me my lower crowns are shaking ( Grade 1 Mobility ) and even told me about the retainers for my lower teeth aren\u2019t right. I had even told Dr Reshma it was shaking after the procedure and she said no it isn\u2019t. \nNow the Dr here wants my previous X-ray before getting done with the procedure and to my surprise I realised Dr Reshma never got one done before the treatment and why didn\u2019t she get it done ? \nNow the dentist in Hyderabad won\u2019t be able to know how was my jaws previous to the treatment ( to know why are my lower teeth shaking ) until I take a new one and I can\u2019t take it now as I am pregnant. So the only solution is to be extra careful with my lower crowns as it is shaking. After spending so much money. This is what I get !! \nSo in short my post procedure experience with Dr Reshma was a really bad. There\u2019s lots more to it like during the procedure she said the retainers would cost me 10,000 and when I went to get done with it she said it\u2019s 14,000. After telling her she clearly said 10,000 she agreed for it. But why was the change in the price ? Is it different for every patient ? \nOn one of my crown she left a slight gap saying it\u2019s for flossing and that has increased. So now gaps has also started. So in short the procedure was pathetic. Gum treatment was done so that it can help my gums from not receding, but there is no use. I hope my lower teeth which has the crowns do not fall out during my pregnancy journey and cause me more trouble. Now I am so fed up , tired and regret going to blanco. I am extremely hesitant to wear the retainers further. \nShe did give me the DSD later on. \n\n\t\n\t\n",

The best part about the doctor is that she does not go to harsh on the patient. Gives in a lot of time and comforts them by talking to them. \nThen the same sitting we did the gum uplifting too. My teeth are a little crooked so for that we first did the gum uplifting. \nThe process was completely painless. I did not even feel the pinch of the injection. Her hand is too light and experienced. \nWe are planing for my veneers/ Invisalign soon in coming months once the lockdown is over and life is back to normal. We will be planning that soon and going ahead with that. I LOVE the doctor! Just an amazing person to be around when you have dental issues! \nThankyou. ",

Firstly the ambience of the clinic is very soothing and you feel very comfortable there. High quality treatments providing great value. Utmost care and covid-19 precautions are taken over there. No doubt about it. \n\nHad a great great experience for my 7 tooth filling\u00a0 with Dr. Reshma. It was completely painless I did not realise when the treatment was done. Wonderful staff and ambience. I strongly recommend getting dental treatment to be done here.\nNow talking about\u00a0 Dr. Reshma *** ** **** ************* *** explains each and everything before the treatment like what the whole procedure will be. The treatment is completed skillfully. Totally worth it. It was my first visit and sure will be visiting in future too.",

She is super efficient, diligent, encouraging, empathetic and really really good at her job. A rare combination! And, the staff, super friendly, nice, helpful and all around rock stars. \nHonestly, can\u2019t recommend it enough. ",

                "review_text": "A long pending review.\nI DID THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. \nI visited Blanco last October just before my wedding. I was so excited to get a smile makeover after seeing few influencers and celebrities reviewing them. I trusted these reviews and met Dr Reshma Chawla for it and she was so nice initially. They followed the Covid protocols which was a boon. \nDr very calmly explained the procedure and suggested me a DSD to have a look at my smile and whether it suits my face before it gets finalised by me which was quite exciting. Like I could see how my face would look with my new smile before the procedure. ( 15,000 /- ) \nDr never showed it to me. I completely trusted her. I did ask her many times as to when can I see my DSD and she said I am doing that only. I was in so much irritation and pain already that I trusted her completely. All through my procedure Dr was very calm and patient. I really did like her then. Just before my procedure was going to get done, she did advice me to wear retainers (10,000/-) so that my teeth don\u2019t shift in the long run. This wasn\u2019t told initially. \nDuring the procedure, I went through bearable pain but after the procedure got done that\u2019s when the real pain started. It was unbearable. I had my wedding in a weeks time and I was on painkiller althroughout suggested by Dr .Though My smile looked ravishing. This pain killer isn\u2019t right for those who are pregnant which the Dr didn\u2019t tell me then and told me later on. As she knew I am going to get married and could conceive too. But whenever I told her about the pain, she would tell me have as much painkillers you want. My honeymoon was spoiled because of the unbearable pain. Luckily I had only one pain killer. I was on painkillers for nearly a month after the procedure got done. It was so terrible, the sensitivity went to another level and I was out of station so only the pain killer would help me. Suddenly the pain vanished and it was seriously a blessing. But why did this pain happen at the first place ? My lower canines were hitting my upper teeth. Which hurt my gums, jaws and head. Infact full face. That\u2019s when my husband asked me didn\u2019t the Dr show you the smile before you got it done and the answer was NO.. So when I came back to Mumbai , I visited her asap with my husband where she said I needed a cleaning asap and we got done the next day or in a day or two ( 2,500/- ) We even asked her then whether DSD was done and she said a Yes. So can we have a look at it and she very confidently said yes shall give it to you right away which she didn\u2019t.  On the day of the cleaning I asked her again and she said we have to get it from the lab and coordinate with her staff for it. I got done with my cleaning. \nThe teeth looked so nice and shiny  and initially also during the procedure she had done the same but the effect wasn\u2019t the same at all. I asked her then too after cleaning why are my teeth still yellow, dirty and she said \u201c It\u2019s \n like this only \u201c \nSecond time was much better unlike the first time. * ***** **** **** ******** *** **** ********* * \nI kept asking one of the clinic helper ( staff ) for the DSD and she kept saying Dr hasn\u2019t given it to her yet. After few days ,I went to the Dr to take my measurements for the retainers and asked the Dr again for the DSD very politely and she literally yelled at me \u201c ASK THE STAFF \u201c I was so stunned as to suddenly the sweet nice Dr changed lol \nThe staff said it will take few more days. \nThat\u2019s when I knew she hasn\u2019t done it and charged me 15,000/-. I trusted her so much and even told my brother and friends to visit her. My brother did get his treatment done with her much before all this drama. Now the real drama begins. She very well knew she hasn\u2019t done the DSD, so now what will she do ? \nShe very well knew I was pregnant. I just confirmed pregnancy ( in one of her treatments ) and that\u2019s when I asked her about the painkiller and she said I can\u2019t take it during pregnancy.  She didn\u2019t even mention this before and luckily I had stopped taking the painkiller much before I conceived. \nNext day she calls me up ( very sweetly ) and tells me I am talking ill about her to the other patients and scaring them ! When I started questioning about which patients and asked her for more details. Her statement changed and  then she claimed one of her patient heard me talking ill about her to my mother. I have done such a major procedure from her ( Almost 3,00,000/- ) and I very well know I need her for the rest of her life and will I  have the audacity to talk ill about her in her own clinic ?\nShe accused me for something which I haven\u2019t done. Making me so furious and agitated. She very knew I am pregnant *** *** *** **** ******** ** ***** *** I clearly asked her forget all this and give me my DSD which she had no answer. She thought by accusing me with trash, I will forget about the DSD. Then I asked again , she said in 2-3 days shall give you. Why so long ? She had No answer. \nAfter lots of arguments she accepted her mistake and decided to give me a refund. Which I did get but the procedure was hideous. As my husband didn\u2019t want me to take any tension over this. He knew how much I liked her. Further conversations were done by my Husband and her , where she sent him terrible voice notes of her patient saying she got scared by my conversations with my mother and the person who was on the voice note didn\u2019t even know English properly, so I wonder what did she even understand what we were talking. It was just something without validation which proves nothing. \nEven the clinic helpers would literally plead you for a review from the beginning. How can one give a review so soon ?\nDr completely spoiled the relationship with us and we can\u2019t trust her one bit. \nWe can\u2019t visit her anymore. \nEven the retainers for the lower teeth do not fit properly, it\u2019s long and hitting my gums and same was confirmed by another dentist in Hyderabad. I won\u2019t be able to go back to her because the relationship is gone forever but definitely I am at loss after getting done with such a major procedure by her.\nI visited a reputed Dentist in Hyderabad and Dr told me my lower crowns are shaking ( Grade 1 Mobility ) and even told me about the retainers for my lower teeth aren\u2019t right. I had even told Dr Reshma it was shaking after the procedure and she said no it isn\u2019t. \nNow the Dr here wants my previous X-ray before getting done with the procedure and to my surprise I realised Dr Reshma never got one done before the treatment and why didn\u2019t she get it done ? \nNow the dentist in Hyderabad won\u2019t be able to know how was my jaws previous to the treatment ( to know why are my lower teeth shaking ) until I take a new one and I can\u2019t take it now as I am pregnant. So the only solution is to be extra careful with my lower crowns as it is shaking. After spending so much money. This is what I get !! \nSo in short my post procedure experience with Dr Reshma was a really bad. There\u2019s lots more to it like during the procedure she said the retainers would cost me 10,000 and when I went to get done with it she said it\u2019s 14,000. After telling her she clearly said 10,000 she agreed for it. But why was the change in the price ? Is it different for every patient ? \nOn one of my crown she left a slight gap saying it\u2019s for flossing and that has increased. So now gaps has also started. So in short the procedure was pathetic. Gum treatment was done so that it can help my gums from not receding, but there is no use. I hope my lower teeth which has the crowns do not fall out during my pregnancy journey and cause me more trouble. Now I am so fed up , tired and regret going to blanco. I am extremely hesitant to wear the retainers further. \nShe did give me the DSD later on. \n\n\t\n\t\n",

The best part about the doctor is that she does not go to harsh on the patient. Gives in a lot of time and comforts them by talking to them. \nThen the same sitting we did the gum uplifting too. My teeth are a little crooked so for that we first did the gum uplifting. \nThe process was completely painless. I did not even feel the pinch of the injection. Her hand is too light and experienced. \nWe are planing for my veneers/ Invisalign soon in coming months once the lockdown is over and life is back to normal. We will be planning that soon and going ahead with that. I LOVE the doctor! Just an amazing person to be around when you have dental issues! \nThankyou. ",

It was not at all painful even the injection was painless. It was by far the best dental experience and i will recommend her to everyone who is afraid of dentists.",
