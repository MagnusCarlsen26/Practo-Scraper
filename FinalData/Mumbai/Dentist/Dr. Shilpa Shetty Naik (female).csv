"Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Hi Mr Naik was Very excellent in his work I went for My teeth root canal & cap treatment.still it's under process but in first visit the way of Handling to patients was feeling very friendly.
By the cleaning part of teeth he was talking to patients and understanding how the process of teeth cleaning is happening is any pain you are getting.so mentally he makes patients feel very relax during the treatment.
Still my filling & cap treatment is pending but I have got the appointment next week.
Definitely will recommend to others.
