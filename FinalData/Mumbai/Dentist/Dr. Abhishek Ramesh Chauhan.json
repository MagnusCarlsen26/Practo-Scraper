He was very patient with all our naive queries, was very knowledgeable and guided us with great care right from choosing the right denture to getting the implant in place. He would stretch beyond his consulting hours to personally tweak the denture and ensuring my mother tried it multiple times until she was completely satisfied with the fit. He showed great care and love as he dealt with this elderly patient. My mother was very happy with his behaviour and care .

He was very patient with all our naive queries, was very knowledgeable and guided us with great care right from choosing the right denture to getting the implant in place. He would stretch beyond his consulting hours to personally tweak the denture and ensuring my mother tried it multiple times until she was completely satisfied with the fit. He showed great care and love as he dealt with this elderly patient. My mother was very happy with his behaviour and care . I would highly recommend consulting Dr Abhishek. *** ** *** **** ******** * **** *** ** ******************",
