From the moment I stepped into Synergy Dental Clinics, Pune, I knew I was in very capable hands. I came with my very own set of unique and challenging issues, that was NEVER too much for Dr.Pallavi, Dr.Vipin & Dr.Shraddha and their team to handle.
After a blind examination, upon which my needs were identified and recommended action discussed (same needs as already outlined in my home country) we set about a plan of action. Much work was to redo a third parties dentistry previously undertaken in my home country, which had culminated in eventual destructive infections, cysts and additionally bone loss caused by that.
Dr.Pallavi (a renowned Dentist & Cosmetic Smile Design Artiste) Dr.Vipin  ( a renowned Dentist & Dental Implantologist), Dr. Shraddha (a renowned and deftly skilled dentist) and Dr. Ashwini (a renowned Dentist & Root Canal Specialist) partnered with the very able and peerless technician,  Mr.Wasim (a renowned Crown and Veneer Specialist), managed to work nothing short of magic on my infected and receding gums , broken, decaying and damaged teeth AND for a patient with a lifelong lack of confidence in my smile and teeth, managed to transform me, to give me a beautiful, entirely natural smile with the best quality porcelain veneers and crowns on the market today, priced affordably which allowed me a first-time confidence in my smile. A smile, I have NEVER had.
Further assisting this team was a group of assistants from Ziya who kept me organized with all the intricate timings and arrangements to Vaishnavi, Vishmita, Rani who cared for me and knowledgably and expertisely assisted with dental work at hand.   
To Dr. Pallavi and the Dental Team and her very able and professional dental assistants and office manager, my many many thanks and heartfelt gratitude for an experience that was superb and for giving me the opportunity to smile, in a way I hadn’t done since I was a little girl, a long long time ago.
