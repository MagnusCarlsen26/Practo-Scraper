"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I, Smita Shivalkar went through surgery performed by Dr. Vipin Mahurkar, Periodontice. He performed the surgery of implants in place of missing teeth.  The procedure was totally painless thanks to good anaesthesia. The process of implants settling and gum healing went very smoothly, without any complications, which was confirmed by Dr. Vipin Mahurkar with a couple of follow-up appointments. During the most recent appointment, after the surgery, I was happy to hear from Dr Vipin Mahurkar that my implants are ready for the last stage-putting the makeup teeth with crowns and this procedure was done by Dr Pallavi Mahurkar, (cosmatic Dentistry & smile designing specialist).  Dr Pallavi and Dr Dhwani Kapadia were working patiently on me to give me replacement of missing teeth as well as my smile. Overall Iâ€™m very happy with the work that Dr. vipin Mahurkar & Dr Pallavi Mahurkar and their entire team has done for me. I have been feeling great and more confident ever since the surgery. I couldnâ€™t have done it without Dr Vipin & Dr Pallavi's special skillset and support, so thank you!
