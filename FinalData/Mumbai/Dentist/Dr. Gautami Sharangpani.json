She made my child very comfortable  during the entire session, in fact he was really enjoying the air washing procedure as she had given him a few chances to try it out by himself under her supervision. She engaged him during the entire procedure by giving a small mirror to him so that he can see the procedure and give opinions on where actually he wanted the cleaning. It was really fun watching the scene actually. I felt so relieved watching him co-operating with the procedure, kudos to Dr.\nI must say, the search of a good paediatric dentist ended at Tooth Story.\nThank you Dr Gautami for giving my son  a good dental experience.\nIn addition, thanks to both the supportive staffs who were very polite and well mannered and made the overall experience a magical one.\nDefinitely a highly recommended dental clinic.\n",

She made my child very comfortable  during the entire session, in fact he was really enjoying the air washing procedure as she had given him a few chances to try it out by himself under her supervision. She engaged him during the entire procedure by giving a small mirror to him so that he can see the procedure and give opinions on where actually he wanted the cleaning. It was really fun watching the scene actually. I felt so relieved watching him co-operating with the procedure, kudos to Dr.\nI must say, the search of a good paediatric dentist ended at Tooth Story.\nThank you Dr Gautami for giving my son  a good dental experience.\nIn addition, thanks to both the supportive staffs who were very polite and well mannered and made the overall experience a magical one.\nDefinitely a highly recommended dental clinic.\n",
