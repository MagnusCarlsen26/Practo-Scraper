He even explained to me very clearly all the problems with my jaw and how I can prevent future problems from getting worse. He takes his time and makes you feel right at home. And this is coming from someone who hates going to the dentist and has very sensitive teeth. He gives Professional advice, incredibly friendly staff, clean facilities... nothing about which to complain at all. They're very prompt, very thorough, and very cordial. Easily one of the more efficient and helpful clinic I've attended.He was extremely attentive to my needs, asked me questions just to get to know me versus only focusing on my dental needs (he asked a series of questions to understand what kind of headaches I was having when I mentioned I have them frequently). His explanations are thoughtful, he wants you to leave understanding everything that's happened and what needs to happen next. I'll definitely be going back!",

When I sat on the chair I was literally shivering but in no time your patience n tolerance made me feel comfortable and relaxed. The whole experience before and after the procedure was  very smooth n positive. It was painless no swelling or heavy bleeding n it healed fast. I am lucky to be one of your patient. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Wishing u the best always. ",

I quickly remembered him being a dentist and with dedication he brings. Then finally fixed a appointment and he did his best to fix the wisdom tooth without extraction and performing RC the best way. He also helped to fill few tooth's with decay. His friendly approach and value for treatment gave me much assurance and confidence. Thanks a lot Dr. Rohan Patani.",

And this is coming from someone who hates going to the dentist and has very sensitive teeth. He gives Professional advice, incredibly friendly staff, clean facilities... nothing about which to complain at all. They're very prompt, very thorough, and very cordial. Easily one of the more efficient and helpful clinic I've attended.He was extremely attentive to my needs, asked me questions just to get to know me versus only focusing on my dental needs (he asked a series of questions to understand what kind of headaches I was having when I mentioned I have them frequently). His explanations are thoughtful, he wants you to leave understanding everything that's happened and what needs to happen next. I'll definitely be going back!",

When I sat on the chair I was literally shivering but in no time your patience n tolerance made me feel comfortable and relaxed. The whole experience before and after the procedure was  very smooth n positive. It was painless no swelling or heavy bleeding n it healed fast. I am lucky to be one of your patient.
