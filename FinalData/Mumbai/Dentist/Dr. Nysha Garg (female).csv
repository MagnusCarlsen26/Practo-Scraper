To answer each of your queries point by point. 1) We are a Multispeciality Practice, where like any other Advance Multispeciality Center each treatment is done by the Specialist(M.D.S.) in that field, for example Root Canal Therapy by M.D.S. Endodontist, Crown and bridge by M.D.S. Prosthodontist. This is done to ensure perfection in all our treatments. We had discussed the same with you during your first visit and thus scheduled an appointment later in the day for same with our M.D.S.

On clinical and radiographical examination of the concerned wisdom tooth, it was found to be decayed with pulpal involvement. Ideal treatment for this is Root Canal Therapy followed by filling and cap, hence was suggested. 3) Pain is unavoidable part of root canal therapy which needs to be managed properly. We always give our patients 24 by 7 contact number to get back to us. In your case we saw you next day when you were fine and called you for a follow up appointment after a day which you could not come, since you were travelling.
