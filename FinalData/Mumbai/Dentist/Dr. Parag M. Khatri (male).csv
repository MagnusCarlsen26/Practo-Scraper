After visiting many doctors I visited DR.PARAG KHATRI and my hunt for a good comforting well  soft spoken dentist ended here..
I explained my issue and my fear .
 he was polite and explained every query  on the spot.
On the day of my implant dr khatri and another doctor who was same natured  comforted me  and were very presice and patient in their work. A big thumbs up for that.

There was no pain at all while doing the sugery as well as post also was well taken care of.
  What I liked most that dr khatri after being busy still took time to call me and ask  me how's everything . Which many doctors don't do that . 

It was touching and made me confident to do other dental problems solved only by dr khatri.

 They have done the implant but crowning is remaining which I know will be done PERFECT  MATCHED.

1. On my first visit I was greeted with chilled Apple Fizz and a typed prescription with clearly mentioning my issues on one side and medicines on another. He did not poke the decayed teeth instead asked us to get a second x-ray and email the same instead of running around. 
2. We discussed everything else via phone and chat. He was prompt in replying and gave detail replies. 
3. On the D-day it went so smoothly, he kept on chatting and making sure I was not in pain. Both him and his staff member - Sandhya were highly professional. I had very less swelling than I had expected and was able to chew solid food within few hours. He went ahead and enquired about my health in the evening.
4. Today is my 3rd day after surgery, both teeth are healed, though I still have stitches on. I don't really remember getting it done.
