The atmosphere is very comforting and hygienic. 
I felt satisfied with the efforts put up by Dr. Shruti and her team of Doctors in executing my complex treatment. The treatment also included dental implant for my previously done root canals, which complicated the whole thing. But it was handled professionally. I hardly felt any pain during treatment whether done by Dr. Shruti or by Dr. Urvisha, it was definite sign of gentle and crafty hands at work. Also the precise and accurate details of implants were made sure for implants longevity. The experience was definitely better than my previous visits to other dental clinics.
