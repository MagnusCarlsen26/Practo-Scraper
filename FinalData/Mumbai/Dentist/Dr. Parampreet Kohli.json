The clinic is well equipped and very tech oriented. The transparency with which they operate is something that blew my mind. I was shown every little details with cameras, mirrors, computer etc and this made me well aware of what is happening with my teeth. This added so much faith in the treatment that during the procedure my mind was so much at ease. After care was really good, everything was seamless. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone.",

He could\u2019nt eat properly before and it was bothering me from quite some time to see him suffer like this. Did my research on dental implants and how to get fixed teeth. Was amazed to see that such complex procedure are done so skillfully and in no time. Total 2 appointments it took, each around an hour or so. Doctor Parampreet is such a nice doctor. My father was so comfortable getting the treatment done, he was communicating with her very openly, we were a little scared and were asking lots of questions and she answered each and every question of ours very emphatically. The followups by the team at Smile Couture was exceptional. They reply promptly, genuinely care about how the patient is doing after the treatment. I admire this. Please don\u2019t think twice, just go and get a consult done for any issue that you are facing, the are the best dentist here.",

My mom is really comfortable and happy. \n\nwill definitely recommend Dr. parampreet kohli",

Read the reviews and called them up for appointment. Giving a brief history about me, I had undergone a root canal treatment around 6 years ago and it was not a pleasant experience and I was very fearful of having a root canal again. Was having pain in the same tooth for a long time but was not willing to go to a dentist. The pain became severe and that\u2019s when I actually went on google and typed best dentist in lokhandwala and started reading the reviews of Smile Couture Dental Clinic. Really liked the reviews and decided to give it a try.\n\nRight from the moment I visited the dental clinic, I had several instances where I was delighted. The way the dentist spoke and consulted me. She asked me every single detail about what I was going thru. She made a point to understand my dental fears and I started feeling nice about the dentist as I was sharing more and more information. \n\nThe tooth was examined and it was found that we had to extract it and place a dental implant. Dentist Kohli explained what dental implant means and how they function. I got to know about various treatments done via dental implants. I immediately decided to go for the treatment and my tooth was extracted and the dental implant was placed. I was watching TV while all this was happening and trust me the treatment and the procedure was very smooth and comfortable. The entire treatment of dental implant took around 30 minutes, I was well informed what each and every step of dental implant will be and that made me go away with my dental fear.\n\nI got my teeth cleaning and teeth polishing done after my dental implant treatment. The dental clinic is really well made, they have car parking available. I have my next appointment in about 3 months where I will be getting a dental crown placed over my dental implant. Really happy and satisfied with the entire experience. Would highly recommend this amazing dental clinic in andheri and I am glad that I have found Dr. Parampreet Kohli, she is undoubtly the best dentist in mumbai.",

He could\u2019nt eat properly before and it was bothering me from quite some time to see him suffer like this. Did my research on dental implants and how to get fixed teeth. Was amazed to see that such complex procedure are done so skillfully and in no time. Total 2 appointments it took, each around an hour or so. Doctor Parampreet is such a nice doctor. My father was so comfortable getting the treatment done, he was communicating with her very openly, we were a little scared and were asking lots of questions and she answered each and every question of ours very emphatically. The followups by the team at Smile Couture was exceptional. They reply promptly, genuinely care about how the patient is doing after the treatment. I admire this. Please don\u2019t think twice, just go and get a consult done for any issue that you are facing, the are the best dentist here.",

So recently I got my wisdom tooth removed at smile couture dental clinic and had a good experience so decided to take my mom there.\n\nthe consultation was done by Dr. parampreet kohli and she was patient and listened to my mom and what all dental issues she was having. since ,my mom didn't have teeth on both sides in the lower arch, Dr. parampreet recommended 2 implants on each side followed by a screw retained bridge.\n\nthe implant placement was done in one sitting on both the sides and it was quite painless and smooth for my mom. post the surgery Dr. Parampreet made sure that she followed up how my mom was doing. My mom is really comfortable and happy. \n\nwill definitely recommend Dr. parampreet kohli",

Read the reviews and called them up for appointment. Giving a brief history about me, I had undergone a root canal treatment around 6 years ago and it was not a pleasant experience and I was very fearful of having a root canal again. Was having pain in the same tooth for a long time but was not willing to go to a dentist. The pain became severe and that\u2019s when I actually went on google and typed best dentist in lokhandwala and started reading the reviews of Smile Couture Dental Clinic. Really liked the reviews and decided to give it a try.\n\nRight from the moment I visited the dental clinic, I had several instances where I was delighted. The way the dentist spoke and consulted me. She asked me every single detail about what I was going thru. She made a point to understand my dental fears and I started feeling nice about the dentist as I was sharing more and more information. \n\nThe tooth was examined and it was found that we had to extract it and place a dental implant. Dentist Kohli explained what dental implant means and how they function. I got to know about various treatments done via dental implants. I immediately decided to go for the treatment and my tooth was extracted and the dental implant was placed. I was watching TV while all this was happening and trust me the treatment and the procedure was very smooth and comfortable. The entire treatment of dental implant took around 30 minutes, I was well informed what each and every step of dental implant will be and that made me go away with my dental fear.\n\nI got my teeth cleaning and teeth polishing done after my dental implant treatment. The dental clinic is really well made, they have car parking available. I have my next appointment in about 3 months where I will be getting a dental crown placed over my dental implant. Really happy and satisfied with the entire experience. Would highly recommend this amazing dental clinic in andheri and I am glad that I have found Dr. Parampreet Kohli, she is undoubtly the best dentist in mumbai.",

I am writing a bit longer review explaining about my procedure. Very happy with the experience, the dentist is a young girl and I found her very experienced. Previously I was unable to find a good dentist near me and one of my friend told me about Dr. Parampreet. I called up the dental clinic and took an appointment, and told about my issue. She educated me with respect to the available options in dental implant and also on various types of crowns that I could choose from. Best thing about her was that she patiently explained everything in detail and answered all my questions which helped me come up with a decision. I agreed to go ahead with the treatment. The procedure was smooth, painfree and I found her hands to be very gentle. The temporary tooth is very good. Clinic is really well made, its looks very hygienic and safe. Waiting for my implant to get attached to my bone properly and after approximately 3 months will get my cap fixed. Finally, I would like to mention that Dr. Parampreet Kohli is an MDS in implantology and has a lot of experience in placing dental implants and crowns, please don\u2019t hesitate to visit her if you want to get these treatments done. I am happy to find her and her dental clinic near me. She is experienced, passionate and stays in the same building as the clinic which gives me peace of mind that I could reach out to her during any dental emergency.",

I will not lie that I was very apprehensive about getting the whole procedure done, but the way Dr. Parampreet kohli ensured me that the whole process will not be painful and what I really appreciated was that at the beginning only a complete treatment plan was given to us with the time line, which made it quote clear.\nSo firstly I underwent 6 implants in the upper and lower arch (both done at 10 days apart) post that she gave me a temporary denture for 3 months.\nAfter 3 months of the surgery, the permanent caps were put over the implant and the results are simply amazing. My new smile looks and feels incredibly natural. It's hard to believe that I have implants \u2013 they all feel so natural. I can eat and enjoy food like how I used to when I had my natural teeth.\nThe professionalism and expertise of Smile Couture Dental Clinic team is truly outstanding. They meticulously planned and executed the entire procedure with precision and care. I felt minimal discomfort throughout the process, which is a testament to their skill.\nWill definitely recommend Dr. Parampreet kohli and her services",

I searched online and found Smile Couture Dental Clinic in andheri west. We took a consultation from Dr Parampreet Kohli and she very nicely explained about dental implants, dentures and bridges. We underwent dental implant treatment and got 2 implants placed on the same day itself. The entire procedure took just an hour and it was conducted very smoothly. After the treatment, Dr kohli and her team made sure that they were following up on how my father were doing. This part really touched my heart as we were not expecting them to do such proactive followups. we came after about 3 months and got dental crowns place on top of them. got a warranty certificate for the zirconia crowns and the dental implants. again the followup post the treatment was amazing.  she is indeed the best dentist in mumbai as far as I am aware\u2026 everything is so professional and human at the same time. they have car parking available, have all experienced dentists in the clinic. I am very satisfied with the experience and I am happy ** ******* **** *** **** ****** ****** **** ** and would recommend them to everyone looking for the best dentist for themselves or their family.",

Their expertise was evident, and it's clear they genuinely care about their patients' oral health and satisfaction.\n\nThe teeth whitening procedure itself was comfortable and efficient. The dental hygienist made sure I was comfortable throughout the treatment, and the results were truly remarkable. My teeth are now several shades whiter, and the transformation is incredible.\n\nWhat sets Smile Couture Dental Clinic apart is their commitment to patient comfort and safety. The clinic is impeccably clean and well-maintained, which is particularly important in the current health climate. The equipment and technology they use are top-notch, ensuring both effectiveness and safety\n\nI would really recommend this clinic to anyone for their dental requirements.",

I found Smile couture dental clinic and met their chief MDS dentist Dr. Parampreet , she evaluated my condition, took couple of xrays and found out that my old root canal got infected and hence I was having the pain. I was shown the X rays and we could see that a broken piece of metal was inside my tooth which was left while my previous root canal was done. The tooth was severely infected and Dr. Kohli did the teeth extraction and then placed an immediate implant.\n\nI was not aware about dental implants and usually I do my research thoroughly before deciding to do any treatment, but the way the dentist explained the entire procedure, she showed me videos of the dental implant treatment, answered all my questions, it just built up the trust immediately. I immediately decided to go for the teeth extraction treatment followed by placing the dental implant. The entire procedure was so smooth, it happened in less that 30 minutes. \n\nThe followups post the treatment were the game changer, the staff and the dentist both were prompt in answering any questions that I had, all I had to do was just message them on Whatsapp. I am really greatful to find the best dentist in oshiwara, she is really good. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to get the **** dental treatment done at really reasonable cost.",

In the first appoitment she met my dad, she discussed what options he had and he finally decided to go ahead with the same removable dentures. The whole procedure took 4 appointments and was managed pretty professionally. What I really appreciated was I told Dr. parampreet that my dad is travelling in 20 days for a trip and she made sure the whole procedure was done before that along with multiple follow ups.\nWhen the denture was delivered to my father and the Doctor was very patient with him and made sure all his issue were sorted. He is really happy with it.\nWill really recommend Dr. Parampreet!!!",

She nicely did all my fillings and explained me the reason for the cavity, which was improper oral hygiene since since my teeth were not aligned.\n\nI told her about my hatred towards the braces and she gave me the idea of invisible braces also called aligners. We got my scan done and they showed me on the scan how my teeth will look post the aligner treatment.\n\nI decided to go ahead with it and its been 6 months now, I can see the changes happening and I am loving it.\n\nWill totally recommend Dr. Parampreet kohli and her clinic, Totally worth it!!",

She told me both Dental veneers as well composite bonding, and explained both of the procedures in detail. I decided to go ahead with composite bonding. And she scheduled me an appointment after couple of days and the whole procedure was done within one hour. I simply love the results and my smile has never looked better.\nReally thankful to Dr. parampreet & Smile couture dental clinic",

Dr. Kohli and her team of experienced oral surgeons made me feel at ease from start to finish. They explained everything clearly and took great care of me during the procedure. The dentist gave me anesthesia and waited for 5-10 minutes for it to act. Post that, it just took them 10-15 minutes to extract the tooth. I did not feel any pain during the treatment. I was given a at home instruction manual for me to take care of my jaw. I experienced minimal discomfort afterward, and my recovery was quicker than I thought. Dr. Kohli's professionalism and the friendly atmosphere in her office really put me at ease, she is by far the best dentist in andheri that one can get. If you need wisdom tooth extraction, she's the one to go to!",

This gave me confidence to book an appointment as I needed the best dentist in lokhandwala. She was very patient with me. She sat me down and explained the entire procedure, answering all my questions. The entire treatment took some time and there were multiple appointments. Each and every appointment was smooth, and the clinic always felt welcoming. The result? A perfectly fitted painfree implant that feels just like my own tooth. I couldn't be happier with my experience at Smile Couture Dental Clinic and especially with Dr. Parampreet Kohli. *** ** ********** *** **** ******* * **** **** **** *******",

The way the doctor spoke and consulted us, she was just extremely patient with my daughter and explained her each and every thing with the help of animated videos. My daughter was watching her favourite cartoon while getting her dental sealant treatment. When she came back home, she was having such good memories of her first visit. I am glad that I have found the best dental clinic in andheri as it\u2019s really important for me to give my daughter the pleasant experience as this makes the foundation of a good oral care routine.

She then recommended root canal and educated me in detail as to what the procedure is, why we do it and how it\u2019s done. This was the best part of my experience. The transparency with which Dr. Kohli operated, she was telling each and every thing in advance. I went for a total of 4 times to complete my treatment.

She took the time to walk me through every step of the procedure, making sure I felt confident and relaxed. This was the first time that I have visited a senior dentist who is an MDS and I could feel the difference with which the entire treatment was conducted.  I had so many questions for which she patiently listened and answered each and every one of them. I got to know so much about my oral health and how to maintain it. Her precision during the treatment ensured a pain-free experience, she was continuously checking on me if I was experiencing any discomfort and would give me adequate breaks in between whenever I asked for it. Giving 6 stars out of 5 her and her dental clinic in andheri west.",

This is the best dentist that I have ever met in Mumbai. The explanation of the treatment was so good.

Dr. Parampreet did the treatment related to her specialty of Implants and Crowns, whereas Dr. Ankita did root canal. The good thing about their clinic that I like the most is the transparency and honesty with which they communicate. Unlike other dental clinics, here, every treatment is done by a specialist and they openly convey this message to their patients. It makes your mind go at ease immediately that an expert is working to give you the best treatment. They are really passionate about giving the best to their patients and I give them my best of wishes. God bless them !",

My dental procedure was done really smoothly. Doctor took care to see if I was comfortable throughout the procedure which frankly few doctors care about nowadays. I felt heard and well informed. The way she has made the entire her dental clinic setup is something to admire. They have car parking for the customers which I feel speaks a lot about their patient service. \n\nPlus everything is so clean and hygienic with all latest equipments. Staff is also good, polite and helpful.\n\nWould definitely recommend. \ud83d\udc4d",
