My first appointment for just a checkup of tooth pain was fruitful as he did the necessary xrays, explained the problem, the remedial procedure required and the costs involved. His inputs helped me take a decision and I booked the appointment with him in the next 5 days for wisdom tooth extraction as well as root canal of the adjoining tooth damaged by the wisdom tooth. I had 3 appointments post that - \n\nAppointment 1 - 1 hr sitting. Wisdom tooth extraction was tricky but was completed successfully. Required stitches post the operation. The adjoining tooth was then prepared for root-canal by removing the infected tissues and medicine being applied. I followed the instructions of the doctor post the operation regarding food intake and cold compression so faced very little swelling and almost no pain (if you take all the medicines on the time).\n\nAppointment 2 - 45 mins sitting. Stitches were removed. Tooth was checked if the infection had gone completely post which it was shaved and impression was taken for the crown .\n\nAppointment 3 -  15 mins sitting. The new crown was nicely fit in place.\n\nDoctor was supportive through all the sittings and during the procedures.  He will not recommend anything if not necessary. Definitely recommended. ",

The doctor told me that the filling was big and would require 2 fillings which I found a little surprising because he ended up doing 1 filling only eventually.\n\nAlso, I clearly remember him telling me it is 900 per filling so total Rs 1,800. But when I went to pay the money, he told me its 1,800 per filling so total of Rs 3,600. Even if I give the benefit of doubt of miscommunication, *** *** *** ******* **** * ******** ** ***** *** **** *** charging me for 2 filling when doing only 1 filling ** ***** ** ****** * ***** *** ****** * **** *** * * * ** *******\nThis was the 2nd time I went to this doctor because I found him friendly and economical in first go. But the 2nd experience has been quite disturbing I would say. Did not appreciate the dishonesty of mentioning 1 amount and charging another in the end. I seriously feel I should have not gone here and will never go again.\n\nIf you are planning to visit, will highly recommend to clearly ask the total cost twice before proceeding for any treatment.\n",

The process is almost painless, you might have a little pain with the rubber clamp while getting the root canal but that goes away as soon as the clamp is removed. The process took around 80-90 mins to do the full thing which included filling  two of my cavities as well. After getting root canal I had problem because of unevenness in the filling which was placed as a placeholder until the capping was done, it was a minor issue but as I could not visit the doctor I used to have pain while chewing. Dr Rane fixed that issue in less than 30 seconds. The capping process was very fast just 10-15 mins visit was all it took to get it done, although it might take up to 30-40 mins for the pre capping procedure which includes taking the measurement and preparing the space for capping. It has been five days now and it feels as if my tooth was never infected it is as normal as it used to be.",

It was that painless. And it's been a day after the surgery now, and it still is painless now with the prescribed medication. With quite a lot of comfort now, I think I'm going to get back to office within a day or two.\nHighly recommend Dr. Rane.",

My first appointment for just a checkup of tooth pain was fruitful as he did the necessary xrays, explained the problem, the remedial procedure required and the costs involved. His inputs helped me take a decision and I booked the appointment with him in the next 5 days for wisdom tooth extraction as well as root canal of the adjoining tooth damaged by the wisdom tooth. I had 3 appointments post that - \n\nAppointment 1 - 1 hr sitting. Wisdom tooth extraction was tricky but was completed successfully. Required stitches post the operation. The adjoining tooth was then prepared for root-canal by removing the infected tissues and medicine being applied. I followed the instructions of the doctor post the operation regarding food intake and cold compression so faced very little swelling and almost no pain (if you take all the medicines on the time).\n\nAppointment 2 - 45 mins sitting. Stitches were removed. Tooth was checked if the infection had gone completely post which it was shaved and impression was taken for the crown .\n\nAppointment 3 -  15 mins sitting. The new crown was nicely fit in place.\n\nDoctor was supportive through all the sittings and during the procedures.  He will not recommend anything if not necessary. Definitely recommended. ",

The fees were clearly  mentioned before starting the procedure ( as a protocol, we mention the fees before doing any treatment for all our patients) After removing the filling, dr realised that adjacent tooth also has developed the cavity and needs attention and dr completed both the fillings only after your consent for the same including fees.\nOff course the treatment rendered to you in both appointments were different and so was the fees.",

The doctor told me that the filling was big and would require 2 fillings which I found a little surprising because he ended up doing 1 filling only eventually.\n\nAlso, I clearly remember him telling me it is 900 per filling so total Rs 1,800. But when I went to pay the money, he told me its 1,800 per filling so total of Rs 3,600. Even if I give the benefit of doubt of miscommunication, *** *** *** ******* **** * ******** ** ***** *** **** *** charging me for 2 filling when doing only 1 filling ** ***** ** ****** * ***** *** ****** * **** *** * * * ** *******\nThis was the 2nd time I went to this doctor because I found him friendly and economical in first go. But the 2nd experience has been quite disturbing I would say. Did not appreciate the dishonesty of mentioning 1 amount and charging another in the end. I seriously feel I should have not gone here and will never go again.\n\nIf you are planning to visit, will highly recommend to clearly ask the total cost twice before proceeding for any treatment.\n",

The process is almost painless, you might have a little pain with the rubber clamp while getting the root canal but that goes away as soon as the clamp is removed. The process took around 80-90 mins to do the full thing which included filling  two of my cavities as well. After getting root canal I had problem because of unevenness in the filling which was placed as a placeholder until the capping was done, it was a minor issue but as I could not visit the doctor I used to have pain while chewing. Dr Rane fixed that issue in less than 30 seconds. The capping process was very fast just 10-15 mins visit was all it took to get it done, although it might take up to 30-40 mins for the pre capping procedure which includes taking the measurement and preparing the space for capping. It has been five days now and it feels as if my tooth was never infected it is as normal as it used to be.",

It was that painless. And it's been a day after the surgery now, and it still is painless now with the prescribed medication. With quite a lot of comfort now, I think I'm going to get back to office within a day or two.\nHighly recommend Dr. Rane.",

I have reason to believe he has wizard hands... I got some elaborate work done at his clinic without an iota of pain or discomfort. Instead, he made it feel like home, right down to the music that he plays as he works his magic! His setup is spick and span with all measures and protocol of safety and hygiene in place. His equipment and technology seem to the finest I have known or seen. His team is extremely cooperative and courteous. They will always meet you with a solution and a smile :)",

I went to him for a second opinion for a root canal therapy and after thorough evaluation and weighing all options, based on his suggestion I went for filling as the cavity exposure to root was very minimal. He was honest that \u201cthe filling may fail, but it is worth giving a shot as it would help retain the natural tooth\u201d. Went for filling and no problem even after an year. Now Dr. Prasad is favourite dentist of my daughter too. She says \u201ceven after growing up, where ever I am, if I have to go to a dentist, I will go to Dr. Prasad only\u201d :)\nHis clinic is very clean and well equipped and his staff are also very courteous and helpful.",

He's never in a hurry to rush appointments. \nThe clinic is very clean with utmost levels of hygiene maintained. The helping staff is also very courteous, well trained and professional.\nI visited for my grandmother's(82yrs) denture. Since the doctor is also a professor he sought the best available option to provide her the best type of fixture. As of a week now after using the new set of dentures, she's very satisfied with the overall procedure.\nI'll definitely REFER & RECOMMEND Dr for a 100% satisfactory dental treatment",

Almost after 7 years I found a dentist on web with major reviews and I immediately decided to consult him and that was Dr Prasad Rane. In my first experience I found a dentist who checked each and every tooth which gave me an amazing confidence that he is a professional and not the types who would just check what you show as issue, that proves how professionally concerned he is with your complete oral health. With his expertise I got a very painless root canal done and moreover my pain area that was capping on the implant tooth which was beautifully fixed with no bridging at all (as suggested by earlier 3 dentists that I had consulted) Overall an amazing experience.. Truly worth the visit !!!",
