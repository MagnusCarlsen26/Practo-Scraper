"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,Proficient and caring.  It was in July '20 in the Unlock phase but lot of Doctors were not operating. My wisdom teeth had a very bad infection. I booked an online consultation. The pain was unbearable and pain killers were not working. Dr. Sumana told me to get a Dental X-Ray done. The infection was bad and had hit the canal. She told me it had to be extracted. She also informed me that since the infection has reached the canal post surgery might feel numbness around the operated area which is called paresthesia. If that happens can be treated medically. It did concern me a little but I had to go for the surgery. Post surgery the numbness was there for a couple of months but with continuous medication it vanished.
