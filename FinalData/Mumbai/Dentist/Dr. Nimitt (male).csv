,,0,0,NO,"Doctor was very rude in his behavior...We went for examination of my 2 year old daughter .. First of all we had appointment  at 6 pm, dr came late at 6.30...Just on examing patient he started shouting how you can bring child who has eaten something few minutes ago..Doctor I believe you can understand child of 2 year can't control on her food habits and that was the way at least she was sitting patiently at doctors clinic baby  was little crying while examination , how you can expect a 2 year child to behave like mature adult... Also he explained treatment well but not given paper of estimated expenditure to us.in Nutshell i expect  dr to be more polite while dealing with toddler patients and never recommend this doctor to anyone.

I know my job and estimate paper we never give it to the patient that clinic policy",2020-10-01T05:27:28+0000,Dr. Nimitt
