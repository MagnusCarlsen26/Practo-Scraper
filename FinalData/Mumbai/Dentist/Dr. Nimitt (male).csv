None,None,0,0,NO,"Doctor was very rude in his behavior...We went for examination of my 2 year old daughter .. First of all we had appointment  at 6 pm, dr came late at 6.30...Just on examing patient he started shouting how you can bring child who has eaten something few minutes ago..Doctor I believe you can understand child of 2 year can't control on her food habits and that was the way at least she was sitting patiently at doctors clinic baby  was little crying while examination , how you can expect a 2 year child to behave like mature adult... Also he explained treatment well but not given paper of estimated expenditure to us.in Nutshell i expect  dr to be more polite while dealing with toddler patients and never recommend this doctor to anyone. ",2020-09-30 15:54:50,False,False,Bhavana Tahilyani,"Madam want to clarify few things ,if you felt I was rude then sorry for that ,first primary thing is whenever there is dental appointment schedule for check up you are not suppose to feed the child atleast for half n hour and even if you have done atleast u should give her water and rinse her whole mouth so she is ready for check up not full of food and ask the dentist do a check up that why I told you the protocol and I deal every day in kids so I know they are not mature adults and know there behaviour dealing it since 10 years  !!! you would have felt my words harsh regarding feeding but it was for your child benefit I was doing my job !!! I know my job and estimate paper we never give it to the patient that clinic policy",2020-10-01T05:27:28+0000,Dr. Nimitt
