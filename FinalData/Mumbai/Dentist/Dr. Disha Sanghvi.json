Right from planning and explaining me the entire process to swiftly scheduling, handling and executing my complicated fractures and case so wonderfully, you\u2019ve been extremely gentle and a perfectionist with your treatment, also I\u2019m glad we took a conservative approach and I went by your advice. My surgery went very smooth and my implants were a cakewalk, I genuinely didn\u2019t feel any pain or discomfort. Thank you for making me smile and eat again. My friends and family couldn\u2019t make out the cosmetics that you\u2019ve done on my teeth, I feel so good and can\u2019t thank you enough for doing this amazing job.

Also one of the core duties of a doctor (which 90% doctors don\u2019t do) is themselves taking a follow up, which she did for me, For sure I do recommend her for your dental requirements.

Considering that I have a deep bite, I think she did a fabulous job. She is quite friendly, soft spoken and very good at her work. \n\nThere are some doctors who'd just perform a procedure and get done with it and then there are doctors like Disha who are truly passionate about the work they do and that reflects in the results. I mean, the way she addressed all the finer nuances meticulously, its really commendable. What she eventually did had an element of art in it as well. \n\nAlso prior to the treatment, Dr Disha explained all the possible alternatives to evaluate from (braces, vineers, crowns, composites) and was kind enough to answer my queries and doubts. I would strongly recommend Dr. Disha",

They are very particular about hygiene and sanitization. My root canal was carried out very smoothly and painlessly. I honestly didn\u2019t feel any pain and I'm really happy with the treatment.

She diagnosed the issue and and found that I had tooth decay and needed a root canal treatment. While I was scared, she took the time to very patiently explain the process to me and promised to make is as painless as possible. She also accommodated me very quickly into her schedule and started the treatment. She completed my treatment in one sitting and I feel great. I can't thank Dr. Sanghvi (And my friend who recommended me to her) enough. I will most certainly recommend her to anybody who needs preventive or active dental work. ",
