Yes. MAGIC. \n\nThe clinic is equipped with state of the art machines including advanced imaging services like OPG and Lasers. \n\nThe final outcome is way beyond my expectations and I cannot stop smiling. \n\nI would like to thank Dr. Manish and his team for the wonderful job on my teeth. \nVery highly recommended.

Yes. MAGIC. \n\nThe clinic is equipped with state of the art machines including advanced imaging services like OPG and Lasers. \n\nThe final outcome is way beyond my expectations and I cannot stop smiling. \n\nI would like to thank Dr. Manish and his team for the wonderful job on my teeth. \nVery highly recommended.

My local doctor said , we can do a simple procedure without any problem but my husband was adamant on seeing Dr. Manish as he knows his work for a long time . After my visit he immediately cleared my doubts and told me about the infection I had under the tooth which my local doctor clearly missed and then explained me exactly what would be the next course of action. He did an impeccable job on that tooth . I am writing this review because he made my life easy and I can actually eat proper food now . Plus the staff is really good , clinic is very clean, the tools are sterilized , they are very accommodating as well. Of course I would recommend my friends and family here. Thank you so much Dr. Manish ! ",

I appreciate a lot the care which the doctor has taken personally to ensure availability of all the things required for the implant as my first implant was of noble cure so the equipments were kept ready and my treatment went on exactly the way he had ensured. I strongly recommend Dr Manish kachhara to all those who are in dilemma how to go for the treatment ? Or wether to get the implant done or not? He will give you genuine advice. Thank you doctor for all of your efforts ",

It was very impressive and made a lot of sense.\nA month later, after some old dental work replacement and some new, I have a brand new smile and I love it.\nbest part about the whole treatment was that he knew the end in mind before starting the treatment and he even gave me a test/trial run.\n\nAbsolutely meticulous and neat, the treatment was painless and planned to perfection.\nDr. Manish and his team made me feel comfortable throughout the treatment and his clinic is extremely hi tech with modern equipment and  machines, all under one roof. \n\nHighly highly recommend.",

The clinic is very hygienic, there is a lot of emphasis on punctuality. Several times, Dr was kind enough to readjust my appointments due to my other personal commitments. At times, he accommodated me in between as well when I had certain urgent issues with my teeth. Overall it has been a very good experience and I would recommend Kachhara's clinic to everyone.",

Doctor went ahead with the root canal and treated the area with antibiotics. Exactly after a year, X-ray images suggested that it was almost completely healed with new bone formation.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dr. Manish Kachhara.  He has very skilled hands which will always keep you at comfort.  He is a Techno savvy person ever updating himself with latest trend and technology entering in the market.  Around six to seven years back, my mother visited Dental Solutions for her dental treatment and thereafter our entire family never visited any other dentist.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended for those who are looking out for best results.\r\n\r\n- Kiran Tandel",
