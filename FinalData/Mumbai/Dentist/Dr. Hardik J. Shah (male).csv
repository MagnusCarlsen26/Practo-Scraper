"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"ALL PROCEDURES WERE ENTIRELY PAINLESS. COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE.

I was suffering from a recurring tooth pain in a previously root canal treated and capped tooth. I ignored this recurring pain for a long time as I was apprehensive in going through the traumatic procedure of dental treatment from whichever dentist I had visited earlier. On a casual discussion with a friend, he recommended me to see Dr. Hardik. Taking his advice I visited his clinic. 

Scheduling an appointment was a breeze.

Dr Hardik welcomed me with a pleasant smile and assured me it will be a painless procedure. He examined me very professionally and with the help of digital x-ray facility he quickly pinpointed the problem to a faulty previously done root canal which resulted in the root getting infected. He explained to me in detail what needs to be done and gave his best recommendations. During the course of the treatment which included re-root canalling medicating and curing the infected root and finally closing and capping with a new perfectly made crown, I could never feel any pain or discomfort.

I could see that with any procedure you take on, his goal is to make it as comfortable and painless as possible. He takes pride in what he does. Time management is impeccable as waiting period is very minimal. His clinic is up to date with all the latest technology and it is very clean. Dr Hardik gives a lot of importance to hygiene. Seeing this hygienic environment itself gives you a lot of confidence and assurance.

Again over the course of my treatment I learned that he is an expert in many procedures like Dental implants, tooth whitening and cleaning etc etc. In short, every procedures for a dental care are available is his clinic. Fees are reasonable and affordable. Dr Hardik is very caring, compassionate, and patient with a desire to make his patients happy with the results.
