I would avoid going there if it was not for my decaying teeth. However when I saw a dental clinic opening in my area I was almost delighted since I didn't have to travel and of course after my visit I could walk home and rest.\nWhat I look forward to a dental clinic is gentle hands and a clean and hygienic environment and that is exactly how I felt when I visited Dr Aslam Inamdar's clinic in 2003. In fact I got more than what I expected. He was so kind, a little shy and of course gentle and professional in his job.\nHis new venture of digital smile has brought happiness to many patients young and old. I see the change in people from bad and decaying teeth to beautiful and healthy teeth, and the smile is like 'cherry on the top'. To me Dr Aslam Inamdar is like a friend and after 13 years I can say he has come a long way, not only is he qualified competent and a pro, but he has acquired many accolades for which I am proud and wish him a great success. As Miguel de Cervantes quotes \"Every tooth in a Man's head is more valuable than a diamond\" if you want to protect your diamond's you know who to call..........of course Dr Aslam.  \n Lawrian Gomes",

When I had my first appointment Dr Inamdar explained me the procedure very well and after that I decided to undergo the treatment of Digital Smile Designing.  The treatment planned with DSD tool is very different from ordinary smile makeover. Dr inamdar is really good at it.Before I use to feel awkward to smile due to the blackish discoloration which were my old metal ceramic crowns..but now Dr Inamdar has changed my smile and I'm happy and satisfied with the treatment provided to me. Now I'm free to give a big smile as Dr Inamdar has changed my smile which contributes in every stage of my life.\n            I'm thankful to the doctor and the staff for the cooperation. They made me feel like I'm home. I would recommend the doctor to all my family members and friends too.",

Eventually I was in urgent need of a dentist cause I never bothered about my cavities. In June 2016, I started my dental implant treatment at IDS. I hate injections even though my parents are from a medical background. After 2 visits my fear for injection and the crazy scary fantasy of how horrible and painful the dental procedures can be, was taken away. Dr. Pranav Anandpara gave me the anesthesia which was so smoothly done that the next time I came and requested him only, to do the needful for me. \nThe clinic is very clean and all the dental equipments completely sterilized. My treatment is almost done. I no longer fear to visit my dentist. And in fact I recommend Dr. Inamdar for any kind of dental procedures. Glad to have been treated by a Dr. who is calm and cool  and thorough in his work.\n-Nicholas Mohite ",

I would avoid going there if it was not for my decaying teeth. However when I saw a dental clinic opening in my area I was almost delighted since I didn't have to travel and of course after my visit I could walk home and rest.\nWhat I look forward to a dental clinic is gentle hands and a clean and hygienic environment and that is exactly how I felt when I visited Dr Aslam Inamdar's clinic in 2003. In fact I got more than what I expected. He was so kind, a little shy and of course gentle and professional in his job.\nHis new venture of digital smile has brought happiness to many patients young and old. I see the change in people from bad and decaying teeth to beautiful and healthy teeth, and the smile is like 'cherry on the top'. To me Dr Aslam Inamdar is like a friend and after 13 years I can say he has come a long way, not only is he qualified competent and a pro, but he has acquired many accolades for which I am proud and wish him a great success. As Miguel de Cervantes quotes \"Every tooth in a Man's head is more valuable than a diamond\" if you want to protect your diamond's you know who to call..........of course Dr Aslam.  \n Lawrian Gomes",

My friends use to tell me to get a treatment done for it, as I use to go for work ,on my way I saw Dr Inamdar's dental studio and was attracted with the pictures of Digital Smile Designing and thought of doing my treatment here. When I had my first appointment Dr Inamdar explained me the procedure very well and after that I decided to undergo the treatment of Digital Smile Designing.  The treatment planned with DSD tool is very different from ordinary smile makeover. Dr inamdar is really good at it.Before I use to feel awkward to smile due to the blackish discoloration which were my old metal ceramic crowns..but now Dr Inamdar has changed my smile and I'm happy and satisfied with the treatment provided to me. Now I'm free to give a big smile as Dr Inamdar has changed my smile which contributes in every stage of my life.\n            I'm thankful to the doctor and the staff for the cooperation. They made me feel like I'm home. I would recommend the doctor to all my family members and friends too.",

Food particles used to get stuck around those bridges and used to make me uncomfortable. I visited Dr.Inamdar's Dental studio on one of my friend's recommendation. He replaced my old metal bridges with ceramic, also I got dental implants for my missing teeth which was painless  procedure !! and above all I had gaps in teeth and old dental work had developed cooked smile for which l underwent smile make over procedure. My god !! my life changed after that. The dental implants provide me ability to chew whatever food I want but the smile makeover procedure gave me lot of confidence. I feel I am not 65 but 50 year old!!! A great psychological boots up for me. Thanks to Dr Inamdar and his digital smile design technology. Its been 2years I have been treated here and I visited for routine check up now. The work done for me is absolutely fine. I am very very happy and pleased with Dr Inamdar's  Dental Studio.I highly recommend every one .Be it dental implants or smile makeover just go for it !!! Very gentle, caring and soft handed Dr Inamdar n his team . keep it up...",

Eventually I was in urgent need of a dentist cause I never bothered about my cavities. In June 2016, I started my dental implant treatment at IDS. I hate injections even though my parents are from a medical background. After 2 visits my fear for injection and the crazy scary fantasy of how horrible and painful the dental procedures can be, was taken away. Dr. Pranav Anandpara gave me the anesthesia which was so smoothly done that the next time I came and requested him only, to do the needful for me. \nThe clinic is very clean and all the dental equipments completely sterilized. My treatment is almost done. I no longer fear to visit my dentist. And in fact I recommend Dr. Inamdar for any kind of dental procedures. Glad to have been treated by a Dr. who is calm and cool  and thorough in his work.\n-Nicholas Mohite ",

Moreover, I did not face any dental issues throughout the year. \n\nWhat encouraged or motivated me to undergo treatment with Dr. Aslam Inamdar is the flexibility in appointments, time devoted towards my treatment, cooperation of the staff and follow up on my oral health.\n\nI am really satisfied with the services and would like to recommend my friends and family to him for dental issues if any in the future.\n\n",
