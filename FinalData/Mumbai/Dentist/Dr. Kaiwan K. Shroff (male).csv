"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,I  have been terrified when visiting a dentist all my life. Dr Shroff made me feel very comfortable and at ease. He was very patient and  I am now encouraged to get other treatments done. He gives enough time and pays attention to  every small detail. I love the fact that he follows up even after the treatment is over but never pushes into getting more work done if he does not find it necessary. I surely recommend him  to everyone. ,2018-04-12 05:51:04,False,True,Farah Dotiwalla,,,
