Dr.  Dipika Bharani was fantastic. They took the time to explain the procedure and answered all my questions, making sure I was comfortable throughout the process. The equipment used was modern, and I could tell that hygiene and patient care are top priorities at this clinic.

The cleaning was thorough yet gentle, and I appreciated the dentist's attention to detail. I left the clinic feeling well taken care of and informed about my dental health.
