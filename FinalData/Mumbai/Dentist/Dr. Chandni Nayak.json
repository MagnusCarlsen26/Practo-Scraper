She works with utmost care and puts in a lot of time and effort to get the desired results keeping the patients best interest in mind. I loved her work, she is a perfectionist! She is friendly, compassionate and very professional. Even with a cavity check up for my little daughter she explained and spoke to her like shes talking to a grown woman and convinced her about the procedure for check up was pain free and wouldn\u2019t hurt one bit. That made my daughter happy too, to readily sit and also have a chat with her.",

After an X-ray, it was clear that an extraction was necessary.\n\nMy experience with Dr. Chandni has been exceptionally smooth, convenient, and surprisingly pain-free. I've always been afraid of injections, but Dr. Chandni's expertise made all the difference. She explained the entire procedure in detail, and because of my age (69) and the minimal bone available for an implant, she consulted with top specialists in Mumbai. They devised a solution that made me feel very confident about the extraction and implant process.\n\nDuring the procedure, Dr. Chandni's touch was so gentle that I hardly noticed it. My daughter, who is terrified of dentists, now only trusts Dr. Chandni. Thank you, Dr. Chandni, for your exceptional care, thorough follow-ups, and most importantly, the pain-free experience. You are truly a godsend.\n\n\nLots of Love and Blessings \nMaya Shah ",

After an X-ray, it was clear that an extraction was necessary.\n\nMy experience with Dr. Chandni has been exceptionally smooth, convenient, and surprisingly pain-free. I've always been afraid of injections, but Dr. Chandni's expertise made all the difference. She explained the entire procedure in detail, and because of my age (69) and the minimal bone available for an implant, she consulted with top specialists in Mumbai. They devised a solution that made me feel very confident about the extraction and implant process.\n\nDuring the procedure, Dr. Chandni's touch was so gentle that I hardly noticed it. My daughter, who is terrified of dentists, now only trusts Dr. Chandni. Thank you, Dr. Chandni, for your exceptional care, thorough follow-ups, and most importantly, the pain-free experience. You are truly a godsend.\n\n\nLots of Love and Blessings \nMaya Shah ",
