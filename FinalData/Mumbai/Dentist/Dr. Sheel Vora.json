So I hardly had few months and everyone was unsure if it can be done in this short span. However I was assured by DrSheel that it can be planned and completed on or before time and there is no worry. He explained everything in detail and educated me about every little thing and what would best suit me which made me comfortable. Even though the lockdown was imposed right after my treatment started we could manage to complete the treatment well before time. All thanks to Dr Sheel I could smile laugh without any hesitation and look beautiful on my special day ! ",

Dr. Vora took the time to explain the condition of my teeth and the most ideal course of action. The entire extraction process took less than 10 minutes and I've felt no pain at all. I was allowed to get back to my daily routine the day after. \n\nIf you're someone reading the reviews because you have dental issues and are nervous, trust me you're in great hands. Definitely recommend Dr. Vora to everyone.",

He explained everything in detail and educated me about every little thing and what would best suit me which made me comfortable. Even though the lockdown was imposed right after my treatment started we could manage to complete the treatment well before time.

He is very friendly and supportive which creates the trust factor between patient- doctor and you can rely on him for the procedures.",

Elaborated about my sickness clearly, which made me understand whats wrong ,why it happened, whats the outcome after medication ,and what can happen to greater extend if the pain continues same way. Now a days doctors dont have that much time to explain,they only look when you will pay. But the fees ,i cant believe ,super affordable.waited for 20 minute but i can see the doctor was busy, at 2.45 i met him and i am sure ,he missed his lunch on that day,may be everyday. Such a caring doctor hard to find. \n\n*** ********* ****** *** ** ********* Its been 2 days and i got relief from the first day. Medicines are also affordable. The most beautiful thing about  doctor's service is , he does from heart.smiles ,communicates. I wish all the doctors of india could be like him. A huge thanks ana a hug to doctor for taking me out of this pain. ",
