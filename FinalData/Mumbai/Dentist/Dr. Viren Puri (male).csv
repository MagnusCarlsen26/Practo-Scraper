None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Viren Puri is a very knowledgable individual. Extremely warm, gentle and welcoming too.  
He's someone who is very passionate about dentistry. The enthusiasm with which he operates makes it very clear that he loves what he does.  As a result of this he has a perfectionist's approach to his work.
He's one of the few doctors i've met who takes the effort of explaining every single step of the treatment to the patient. This way you know exactly what he is planning and feel actively a part of the process. 

I have a lot of dental issues and have visited over 5 dentists in the last 4 years, most of them look for quick/ temporary solutions to problems. Dr. Puri, on the other hand, suggested to me upfront that i should look for a permanent solution, even if it means waiting a little longer. 

Unlike most  dental clinics, his clinic in Juhu is large, airy and beautifully done up. There is always soft music playing in the background, hence one does not feel the usual nervousness/ claustrophobia experienced at most clinics. 

The technology he uses is state of the art. In my case (invisible braces), brackets were specially designed to fit my teeth as one single piece by a Chinese manufacturer. 

His clinic staff is extremely warm, well trained and professional. They send regular alerts and reminders for appointments.

 It's very important for a patient to form trust and a certain comfort level with a doctor. Dr. Puri makes it very easy for this to happen. He takes his work very seriously and wants the best results as much as you do. One feels a lot of ease around him as he knows exactly what he is doing and does it with a lot of confidence. 

If you're looking for a dentist, i very strongly recommend Dr. Viren Puri.

None,None,0,0,YES,"I had great experience with Dr. Viren Puri. He's not only very intelligent but very very cooperative , even with as troubled case as I had been.
I had orthodontic treatments twice already before visiting him, by other doctors, but was not satisfied with the results. Then I found out about braces and smiles via internet and wished to consult Dr. Viren Puri. And after consulting him, started my treatment here.. And he could finally get me the results for the positioning of my teeth, the way I wanted! I'm very much satisfied with the results. 
I can only thank Dr. Puri for that!!",2015-07-09 17:55:32,False,True,Mr. Pawan Balani,,,
