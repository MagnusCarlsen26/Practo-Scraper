None,None,0,0,YES,"This was my fourth visit to this clinic and so  far had the best experience.   My root canal procedure was done in just one sitting and the pain was quite manageable. The doc was extremely thorough and clear on what she was doing every step of the way.The technology allowed me to see the pre and post treatment.I also consulted with the doc about a cosmetic procedure. What  I appreciate here is that they don't push you for any procedures even if they suggest them. 
Also, I have never waited more than 5 minutes  for my name to be called in and to  get started on. 
I would definitely recommend this clinic. The peppy music in the background n the expertise of the doc would calm down even a nervous patient.
Thank you for a pleasant experience.
