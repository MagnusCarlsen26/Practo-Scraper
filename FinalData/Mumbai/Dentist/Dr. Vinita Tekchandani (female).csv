"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Dear people,
I would highly highly recommend you using Dr Vinita at the white tusk in Mumbai. I was worried at first about using a foreign dentist overseas but I am so happy that I went through with it. 
I was always nervous about smiling as my old teeth were damaged by a motorcycle accident and when I used to smoke. However, now I can open mouth smile again and my confidence has shot up. 

Dr Vinita gives an honest review of what you need and takes into consideration your wants and needs. She gives you the treatment options and explains them in professional easy to understand details. 

I did have a teeth clean, couple of fillings and route canal treatments done, veneers and teeth whitening. Altogether , it cost me about 1000 pounds in british money. This would have cost about 20000 in the UK. From start to finish she provided high quality care, and from start to finish it was painless and looked absolutely remarkable. 

On a personal level, she is an amazing person and is very relatable. 

Thanks so much to the white Tusk and Dr vinita and her staff. üíØ  cent recommend. 

Good luck to you all,

Best regards ,
