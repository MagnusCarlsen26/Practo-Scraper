He explained everything in detail to me before beginning with the treatment and, trust my words, it was painless and he knew exactly what he was doing, on top of that he saved my tooth as he explained my tooth didn't needed the RCT which overall saved me money, tooth and time as well.

His attitude is great which allows him to put the patient at ease. I was very nervous and asked a lot of questions but he patiently handled all of them with a smile. Highly recommended.",

The doc was extremely thorough and clear on what she was doing every step of the way.The technology allowed me to see the pre and post treatment.I also consulted with the doc about a cosmetic procedure. What  I appreciate here is that they don't push you for any procedures even if they suggest them. \r\nAlso, I have never waited more than 5 minutes  for my name to be called in and to  get started on. \r\nI would definitely recommend this clinic. The peppy music in the background n the expertise of the doc would calm down even a nervous patient.\r\nThank you for a pleasant experience.\r\n\r\n",
