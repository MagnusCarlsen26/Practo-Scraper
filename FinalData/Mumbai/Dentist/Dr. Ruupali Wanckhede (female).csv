We are thrilled to share our outstanding experience with Dr. Ruupali Wanckhede and her team! From consultation to completion, doctor exceeded our expectations in every way. Her expertise, professionalism, and genuine care made my husband feel at ease throughout the entire tooth implantation process.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"Whenever I think of a dental clinic I think of the pain and agony i have to go through, which deterred me to do anything for the gap that was created in my gum 9 years back when my broken tooth had to be forcibly removed. Thinking of any treatment for my tooth would mean lots of pain and lots of money. So I chose to carry on a tooth less till my 60 year friend told me that he is doing implant for 8 to 10 teeth. I was shocked at 60....I was curious and asked him the procedure. He told me it was minimal pain and the doctor is very supportive though a little expensive. I waited for him to complete his implants to see the results. Oh it was amazing his smile widened and neatly, in was zapped. He checked with him if he could eat normally without pain and he said yes. Still the fear of pain overcame this feedback. After three months I checked with him again and he said that the implants is not giving any trouble. Then I made up my mind to meet his dentist. I met her and she mentioned it would be a smooth process. The way the dentist explained to me put me at ease. I started the process and as explained by the dentist it was a painless journey. No swelling of the face, no strong medicines, no nausea feeling. Today my tooth is back in its place. Thanks to Dr. Ruupali for all the care and making a diifference to my smile. Dr. Rupali was very caring and gentle while speaking. She responded to every query with gentleness and patience. She spent time with you to explain in detail. Thanks Doctor.
