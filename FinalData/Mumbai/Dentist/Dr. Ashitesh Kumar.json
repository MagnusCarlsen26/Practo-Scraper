Naturally, I cannot benchmark him against another dentist experience, but the following is why I'd love to come back to Dr. Ashitesh Kumar for any dental requirements, and recommend him to others:\n\n1. I showed up at the exact time of my appointment and was pleased to find the Doctor and his Assistant already prepared for the slot. There was no waiting time at all, and the punctuality followed was impressive.\n\n2. Since I had never visited a dentist, I was slightly nervous and had many doubts pertaining to the procedure that'll be followed. Without me asking, Dr. Ashitesh explained me the entire procedure and had me relaxed\n\n3. He kept appraising me on the progress of the procedure and also showed me the progress using a microscopic camera at vital points. This, coupled with his humor/wit had me completely relaxed!\n\n4. The kind of professionalism and warmth with which I was treated was way beyond my expectations. Especially for the price point at which I was offered the above-mentioned treatments!",

I didn't know about Dr. Ashitesh and Dr. Meghna, until I saw the wonderful reviews on Practo and decided to give it a try. I had a bad tooth ache that needed a root canal and cap. My first! And, both Dr. Ashitesh and Dr. Meghana made it so easy, efficient, comfortable and clinical! They know their job; they are keen, minute observers; they are super sensitive to the patient's needs; and they are energetic and agile! They also have a very professional nursing team and front desk - note that I've visited them during the pandemic and their safety precautions are precise (read: I say this as a doctor myself!). Finally, my recent visits were time sensitive - I'm shifting to another city, and I was sceptical of completing all the necessary procedures before the end of the month. But, given their sharpness, efficiency and a well planned treatment, Dr. Ashitesh and Dr. Meghana made it possible and perfect! I would recommend them to everyone. Look no further :) ",

I showed up at the exact time of my appointment and was pleased to find the Doctor and his Assistant already prepared for the slot. There was no waiting time at all, and the punctuality followed was impressive.\n\n2. Since I had never visited a dentist, I was slightly nervous and had many doubts pertaining to the procedure that'll be followed. Without me asking, Dr. Ashitesh explained me the entire procedure and had me relaxed\n\n3. He kept appraising me on the progress of the procedure and also showed me the progress using a microscopic camera at vital points. This, coupled with his humor/wit had me completely relaxed!\n\n4. The kind of professionalism and warmth with which I was treated was way beyond my expectations. Especially for the price point at which I was offered the above-mentioned treatments!",

And, both Dr. Ashitesh and Dr. Meghana made it so easy, efficient, comfortable and clinical! They know their job; they are keen, minute observers; they are super sensitive to the patient's needs; and they are energetic and agile! They also have a very professional nursing team and front desk - note that I've visited them during the pandemic and their safety precautions are precise (read: I say this as a doctor myself!). Finally, my recent visits were time sensitive - I'm shifting to another city, and I was sceptical of completing all the necessary procedures before the end of the month. But, given their sharpness, efficiency and a well planned treatment, Dr. Ashitesh and Dr. Meghana made it possible and perfect! I would recommend them to everyone. Look no further :) ",

He explained all procedure and told about the problems too. \n\nNOTE: For those who don't know , braces can be used till you are under 25 yrs old, after that your mouth can't be that flexible to treat properly.So, plzz notify that.\n\nHe is pretty helpful and calm during his treatment, and knows how to handle his patients. Cleanliness and safety procedure at his clinic is nice & clean too.\n\nSo, I would recommend you to consult Dr.Ashitesh in case of any oral problem.",

This enables overcome the wait time that is associated with surgeries, implants etc that require tests to ascertain medical history of the patient and avoiding many routine yet time consuming tests is possible.\nThe other aspects marked above are very true. Dr Ashitesh and his team have fulfilled the aspects of keeping appointments, sending reminders, rescheduling when required. \nThe friendliness of the dentist gets full score as also the explanation of the health issue to the patient.

This attitude of not trying to fix something  that's not yet broken, really appealed to me.\n\nI'd highly recommend their services to anyone looking for good, competent dental care in the Chembur area. \n",
