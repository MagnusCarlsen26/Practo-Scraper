"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Straightening Teeth (Invisalign) ,Dental Restoration,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"So I have completed my Orthodontic treatment at Embrace Orthodontist Khar with Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta. 

About the treatment-

The treatment has been very satisfying, I started my treatment in Oct 2021 and have completed in June 2023 (18 months) and I required 47 aligners in total. As for the cost is affordable (although relatively more than the traditional braces that take more time).

My experience- It took me 2 days initially to get used to the wearing and removal of aligners. Every new aligner was slightly discomforting and painful (bearable pain) for 3 days after that it would be comfortable to wear. I wore the first 25 aligners for 15 days each and the remaining each for a week. I personally think that, the initial discomfort is definitely less compared to the traditional braces. And after 25 aligners I was very much used to the aligners.

My experience with Dr Keyur Shah-

He is amazing. He explained each step very well and is very gentle and patient with his work.

My experience with Dr Shagun Mehta- 
 
I had my cavity tooth fillings/restoration and wisdom tooth extraction treated by her. She too is very patient, gentle and quick with her work. [P.S It took 5 mins for her to get the wisdom tooth extracted ;) ]

My overall experience and special story- 
My wisdom tooth was decayed to the point it reached to the nerve and was very painful, and I had to get it extracted immediately. As it was Ramazan so I could get it treated later in the evening only, both Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta were very considerate and accommodative to schedule the same for me post fast and were very patient though I reached super late and also allowed me sometime to eat/drink/open my fast before starting the treatment.

I highly recommend Embrace Orthodontics Khar, Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta for anyone who wants to get the orthodontist treatment in lesser time, Please note that the treatment plan is subjective based on individual‚Äôs compliance and bone movement. 

Thank you Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta :)
