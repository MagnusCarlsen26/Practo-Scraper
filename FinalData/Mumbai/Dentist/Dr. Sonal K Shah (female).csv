We had a wonderful experience consulting Dr. Sonal Shah for my son. A very calm and composed doctor, She explained the diagnosis so well that it’s easy even for an uneducated person to understand the problem.

The clinic is maintained very well. Clean and hygienic.  
She has toys to engage kids and she engages the kid very well in the language you are comfortable with. 
She gave star badge and toothpaste as a goodie to make kid feel happy to behave well which my son slept with whole night remembering her and waiting to visit her.

She is a amazing in handling kids and she herself is a mother so its easier for parents to relate too. My 3year old needed some cavity fillings and we were a little worried about his as he is quite anxious and hyper. But Dr. Shah took care of him very well.
Her fees are also reasonable and goes by the basics of dental hygiene.

Since we visited her during Covid-19 pandemic, she had ensured highest precautions for our visit and we were more than happy to comply with her guidelines.

Dr. Sonal practices from 2 clinics - Andheri (east) and Andheri (west) and she sees to it that she is available as per your convenience at any of the clinics.

Dr. Sonal Shah is highly recommendable for kids with dental issues. Her simplicity and genuineness stands out. 

Great to know you Dr. Wish you Goodluck. 
Must say..if you get a chance do do visit her and there won't be a look back and disappointment.  Our kid would come out with a smile and a happy experience.

"Doctor friendliness,","Pediatric Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"When I first visited Dr. Sonal with my 3 year old son, I was not too optimistic about the outcome.

(Having visited his earlier dentist several times without success - he was very uncooperative and in fact refused to even enter the clinic, leave alone sit on the chair. And since he was in terrible pain for months, we were told that general anaesthesia is the only option - and this had been causing us a great deal of stress.)

However, within minutes of being with Dr. Sonal, my son took to her instantly - and miraculously, after a couple of brief interactions - sat for treatment willingly and with a smile on his face. My son also loved the talks they would have and really looked forward to his visits.

I would rate Dr. Sonal as EXCELLENT on every parameter - be it friendliness, service, professionalism, and most importantly, patience.
