"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","General  Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I am amazed with how meticulous and responsible Dr Husain Harianawala is. I had severe pain and thought it's ulcers when my Dr refered me to Dr Husain (I had gum damage). He and his team identified the details and very confidently prepared me for the wisdom tooth extraction. Dentists have always been a scare for me and I am so relieved and confident with this extraction. I didn't feel a bit of pain and just pressure as the Dr had promised. He and his team did such a smooth and painless extraction of such a complicated tooth and treated my gum damage too. I just felt all my pain go away so soon instantly as soon as the extraction was done. Though I had heard about the pain after the anasthesia is gone, I didn't feel any pain the same day and throughout the entire 12 days. Just little swelling for a day which is normal and it went away with ice packs. I also flew on the 5th day and returned too. I didn't face any pain, no bleeding, no dry socket throughout.
He designed my medicines schedule according to my schedule.
He explained the after care so well.
He and his entire team were so careful, pleasant and responsible. Advanced instruments for imaging and treatment...
His cartoons on TV were an added pleasure.
Even the stitches removal that I dreaded but I was confident that it's him so I won't feel it and the same happened. No pain at all even after the numbness is gone. It feels like nothing ever happened.
Overall, I'm very happy with the treatment. Though it may seem expensive comparatively but I find Dr Husain and his team's work worth. I would recommend him. I am looking forward for my further treatment too.

Thank you Dr for the painless experience and taking my pain away and also my fear. :)

Doctor makes you feel very relaxed.Lata at the reception is very friendly and prompt on follow ups.,2023-05-09 03:49:46,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
