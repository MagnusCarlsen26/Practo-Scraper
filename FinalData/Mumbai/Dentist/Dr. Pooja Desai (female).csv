"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"So I was very anxious before visiting a dentist as this was the second time I was going to one in my entire life. Finally decided to visit Dr Pooja after a friend's recommendation. Starting with the way she spoke on the call ( very friendly) to accomodating me amidst all her appointments because I was in pain. She even made me completely stress free about the covid situation as she ensured that the clinic is not cramped up. She guided me to the clinic very patiently even though it's pretty easy to locate. Then comes the real part. She put me at complete ease explained me the situation so well and made me aware of why it's important to do certain things right in a root canal treatment. She convinced me to start with the procedure because the situation was bad and immediate attention needs to be given. First she put me at complete ease and ensured that nothing will go further if I am uncomfortable or in pain. Then she started with the real magic. She patiently did the procedure ensuring at no given point I was in pain, if I was then she immediately stopped and made sure I am not. I cannot believe I am saying this but I cannot wait to go back to her and complete my treatment. She was like a family member and looked after me just like my elder sister. She is a very warm and honest medical practitioner. I can only say that I have gained my dentist for life and I am at complete ease if at all I need any attention for my oral hygiene. Thank you Dr Pooja for converting a complete anti dental person to someone who wants to ensure that regular visits will be done. Thank you for everything.
