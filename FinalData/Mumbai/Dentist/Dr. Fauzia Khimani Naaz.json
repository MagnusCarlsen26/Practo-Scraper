Doctor Fahad and Dr. Fauzia both were very friendly and extremely courteous. They listened patiently, examined my case. I have been going to several dentists who advised I needed an Extraction because of the infection. I was disappointed and very sad. My brother recommended Dr.Fahad and I must say He gave me so much confidence by sayin he could treat my problem without extraction!! I was relieved I finally found the perfect doctor. He did a perfect Root canal and drained out the abcess in the lower gum completely. Dr. Fauzia treated the infected black teeth. The process lasted a good two hours. But she was so diligient and patient. She has restored my smile back which in turn has given me a boost in my self confidence! I work at Front Desk in a reputed Firm. Smiling is a major part of my job.\r\nThe clinic inside was well equipped with latest machines and tools. Doctors and nurses were thoroughly proffesional. Hygiene was top notch! I have already told all my neighbours, family, friends even strangers, work colleagues all about my experience and I highly recommend both Doctors!",

But once I came to this clinic I felt positive vibes. Doctor was very humble and showed empathy. She diagnosed the problem well and proposed the correct line of treatment and further executed to perfection. Her soft skills are exceptional when it comes to handling kids. One more thing to note is that she has all the time to answer your queries to satisfaction and is not in a hurry at all. The staff also is well equipped to look after kids during procedures. End of the day, am happy to have landed here.. good job by doctor and support staff, keep it up!\nRegards,\nAsif A R Shaikh",

Doctor Fahad and Dr. Fauzia both were very friendly and extremely courteous. They listened patiently, examined my case. I have been going to several dentists who advised I needed an Extraction because of the infection. I was disappointed and very sad. My brother recommended Dr.Fahad and I must say He gave me so much confidence by sayin he could treat my problem without extraction!! I was relieved I finally found the perfect doctor. He did a perfect Root canal and drained out the abcess in the lower gum completely. Dr. Fauzia treated the infected black teeth. The process lasted a good two hours. But she was so diligient and patient. She has restored my smile back which in turn has given me a boost in my self confidence! I work at Front Desk in a reputed Firm. Smiling is a major part of my job.\r\nThe clinic inside was well equipped with latest machines and tools. Doctors and nurses were thoroughly proffesional. Hygiene was top notch! I have already told all my neighbours, family, friends even strangers, work colleagues all about my experience and I highly recommend both Doctors!",

But once I came to this clinic I felt positive vibes. Doctor was very humble and showed empathy. She diagnosed the problem well and proposed the correct line of treatment and further executed to perfection. Her soft skills are exceptional when it comes to handling kids. One more thing to note is that she has all the time to answer your queries to satisfaction and is not in a hurry at all. The staff also is well equipped to look after kids during procedures. End of the day, am happy to have landed here.. good job by doctor and support staff, keep it up!\nRegards,\nAsif A R Shaikh",
