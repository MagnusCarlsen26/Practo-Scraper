None,"Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,I had severe pain in my tooth. Dr. Rohan immediately relieved it by immediate action. He treated it immediately and my tooth was absolutely pain free after root canal. He also gave me a very natural lookin cap over it. As it was a front tooth I couldn't go out with a bad smile so he prepared a temporary cap for me in a few mins. Have to add the root canal treatment was completely pain free. I m really thankful to Dr. Rohan. Finally I have a reliable and good dentist. ,2016-10-17 04:37:08,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
