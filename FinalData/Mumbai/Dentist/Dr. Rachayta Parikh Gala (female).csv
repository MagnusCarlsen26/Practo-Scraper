3. After having a look at his teeth, she explained tge situation and treatment in a very simple yet factual manner. The child is engaged on the screen at the patient's chair watching cartoons all the while.

4. In a friendly way she told my son that she was going to extract his tooth and it would pain slightly. I appreciate this honesty rather than shocking him later.
