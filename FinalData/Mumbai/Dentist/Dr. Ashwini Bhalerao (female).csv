On her insistence I got a CT scan done and thanks to her foresight we were able to identify a cyst under my tooth. It got diagnosed in good time. What made me most comfortable with Dr Ashwini was that she took the effort to give a detailed explanation on the diagnosis and her recommendation for a surgery to me and my parents multiple times, till we were confident and comfortable.

The procedure was quick and within 2-3 days I was back at work. 

Another good thing that helped the post surgery recovery, was that she was very clear in explaining me what to expect in terms of discomfort and how much time it will take, 

There was some risk of numbness for sometime post surgery, but due to the finesse in which Dr Ashwini would have conducted the surgery, my nerve was not affected and I had zero numbness.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,","Dental Surgery,Surgical Extractions of Teeth,",0,0,NO,"A very unprofessional & terrifying experience. 

In August 2021, I took my 85 year old mom (which is hard to do). The dentist didn't even look at mom's medical history file which we maintain. And decided to remove 2 of moms teeth in 1 appointment in 45 minutes. 

The dentist was rushed & not gentle during the procedure resulting in pain afterwards. No post operative care instructions were given either. I had to ask if antibiotics have to be given, diet or ice to be used.
My mom had terrible pain for 2 weeks afterwards. The dentist should have known better to not remove 2 teeth at the same time for an 85 year old.

And to top it all the dentist charged us 10,000 ( i.e 5000 Rs per tooth for a simple extraction).  Other dentists were charging 2000 per tooth for extraction around the same time.
