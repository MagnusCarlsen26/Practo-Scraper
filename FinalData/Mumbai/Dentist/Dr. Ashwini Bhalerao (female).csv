"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,","Dental Surgery,Surgical Extractions of Teeth,",0,0,NO,"A very unprofessional & terrifying experience. 

In August 2021, I took my 85 year old mom (which is hard to do). The dentist didn't even look at mom's medical history file which we maintain. And decided to remove 2 of moms teeth in 1 appointment in 45 minutes. 

The dentist was rushed & not gentle during the procedure resulting in pain afterwards. No post operative care instructions were given either. I had to ask if antibiotics have to be given, diet or ice to be used.
My mom had terrible pain for 2 weeks afterwards. The dentist should have known better to not remove 2 teeth at the same time for an 85 year old.

And to top it all the dentist charged us 10,000 ( i.e 5000 Rs per tooth for a simple extraction).  Other dentists were charging 2000 per tooth for extraction around the same time.
The dentist has no right to do this to anyone. ",2022-01-10 03:22:54,False,False,Gautam,,,
