"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I had approached Dr. Sanket Gavhane 3years ago for the extraction of my wisdom teeth. He had extracted two teeth back then one of which had to be removed surgically. The procedure went smoothly and I did not experience any pain or trauma. I really liked his treatment plan. Thus, when my other wisdom teeth began to give me problems, I approached Dr. Sanket Gavhane again. Once again, I had an extremely pleasant experience. No pain whatsoever and he was done so quickly, that just shows his expertise in the field. I recommend him to all my friends and family.
