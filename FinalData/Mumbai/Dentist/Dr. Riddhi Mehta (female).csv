"Doctor friendliness,","Gingivitis,",0,0,YES,"It was an amazing experience for me at Dr. Riddhi‚Äôs clinic for my dental care. She was friendly, patient and answered all my queries.",2024-06-15 18:22:06,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I recently did my root canal, tooth extraction, filling, cleaning, etc etc.
Experience with Dr Riddhi has been excellent right from the diagnosis, treatment and follow ups. And more so, patiently explaining the underlying causes and suggesting appropriate treatment without going overboard.
Also, given the time i had with me as I was flying overseas, she accommodated on high priority as multiple sittings were required and also got the cap done on urgent basis with high precision.
I would highly recommend her and lastly from what I have observed at the clinic is that she is excellent with the kids as well making them feel more comfortable.
