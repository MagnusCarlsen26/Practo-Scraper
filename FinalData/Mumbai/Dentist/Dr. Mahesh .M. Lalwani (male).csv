"Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Cleaning,",0,0,YES,"The Doctor was reasonably friendly, matter of fact and efficient.

The cleaning process by itself was fine but pain and discomfort in one of my lower molars on the right side was overlooked. Admittedly, I did not point this out during the procedure or even when the cleaning got over. Also, there is discomfort in one of my upper teeth on the left side. 

My last remark is purely personal to myself, not to be misunderstood in the larger context,  and that is concerning the cost of the treatment. For the first time in my not so infrequent visits to the excellent clinic of Dr Lalwani in the last 32 and odd years, I felt that the cost of the treatment was on the higher side. Maybe it is so because of the cost of various essential additional facilities required to be provided in Covid times, or as I said the feeling is absolutely personal due to my limitations.  Nevertheless, thought it appropriate to mention.
