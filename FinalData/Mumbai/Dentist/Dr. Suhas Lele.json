In fact All the Doctors are Great, Highly Specialized, skilled, young, quick in thought and decision making,\nimplementing decisions on the spot. Excellent management skills and great team work.\nIn my First visit the condition of my teeth were checked within a matter of\nminutes. A detailed study like Initial Analysis of my health condition and\nconditions of the teeth, Duration of Treatment, Mode and method of approach\nrequired in extractions, root canal, implantation etc was done by the Drs. and I\nwas informed of the treatment cost keeping in view of my affordability and\nprocedures were explained in detail. My very first visit to the Dr. Aditi Lele\u2019s, Smiles Forever Clinic at Dadar \u2013 Mumbai, Veer Savarkar Marg, gave me lots and lots of confidence. \nIn every appointment right from the first I was made to feel welcome and\ncomfortable both by the friendly competence of the staff and the pleasant, clean environment of the offiice itself. I underwent several tooth extractions, root canal treatments and six teeth implants. Dr. Aditi Lele and all the Doctors inspire the utmost confidence by wealth of\nknowledge, skill, and professionalism. Latest Digital technologies are used in\nthe process of Implants. Painless treatments during tooth extractions and\nimplantation. Absolutely no pain both mentally and physically. Kudos and the highest recommendation to Dr. Aditi Lele and All the Dr\u2019s at\nSmiles Forever Clinic. Last but not the least the exit drink after every appointment like coffee, Lassi\nwere very soothing to both mind and body. Thank you Doctors, Wish you lots of Happiness, Strong Health and lots of\nwealth to all.",

I'd rather bear the tooth ache than get an injection. But one visit to Dr lele and the fear just vanished. I got my wisdom tooth extracted last year, which required a surgery to pull the tooth out.. the word surgery freaked me out. I also asked him to give me a general anesthesia, but he refused saying he has a better method of doing it.. I could not believe it, till i experienced it.. i had only heard of painless injections and treatments, but I saw it once i was there.. The procedure started and ended in 15 mins, and I didn't even know what was happening in my mouth.. His treatment was truly painless and am his patent for life.\n\nI will sincerely recommend everyone to him, who has a fear of dentists and needles, as Dr Lele, showed me that painless injections and tooth treatments are very much possible. I cannot thank him and Dr Aditi enough for taking away my worst fear in life. Am sure am not the only one with dental issues and fear of pain.. Please visit Dr Lele to experience it yourself.",

A detailed study like Initial Analysis of my health condition and\nconditions of the teeth, Duration of Treatment, Mode and method of approach\nrequired in extractions, root canal, implantation etc was done by the Drs. and I\nwas informed of the treatment cost keeping in view of my affordability and\nprocedures were explained in detail. My very first visit to the Dr. Aditi Lele\u2019s, Smiles Forever Clinic at Dadar \u2013 Mumbai, Veer Savarkar Marg, gave me lots and lots of confidence. \nIn every appointment right from the first I was made to feel welcome and\ncomfortable both by the friendly competence of the staff and the pleasant, clean environment of the offiice itself. I underwent several tooth extractions, root canal treatments and six teeth implants. Dr. Aditi Lele and all the Doctors inspire the utmost confidence by wealth of\nknowledge, skill, and professionalism. Latest Digital technologies are used in\nthe process of Implants. Painless treatments during tooth extractions and\nimplantation. Absolutely no pain both mentally and physically. Kudos and the highest recommendation to Dr. Aditi Lele and All the Dr\u2019s at\nSmiles Forever Clinic. Last but not the least the exit drink after every appointment like coffee, Lassi\nwere very soothing to both mind and body. Thank you Doctors, Wish you lots of Happiness, Strong Health and lots of\nwealth to all.",

I'd rather bear the tooth ache than get an injection. But one visit to Dr lele and the fear just vanished. I got my wisdom tooth extracted last year, which required a surgery to pull the tooth out.. the word surgery freaked me out. I also asked him to give me a general anesthesia, but he refused saying he has a better method of doing it.. I could not believe it, till i experienced it.. i had only heard of painless injections and treatments, but I saw it once i was there.. The procedure started and ended in 15 mins, and I didn't even know what was happening in my mouth.. His treatment was truly painless and am his patent for life.\n\nI will sincerely recommend everyone to him, who has a fear of dentists and needles, as Dr Lele, showed me that painless injections and tooth treatments are very much possible. I cannot thank him and Dr Aditi enough for taking away my worst fear in life. Am sure am not the only one with dental issues and fear of pain.. Please visit Dr Lele to experience it yourself.",
