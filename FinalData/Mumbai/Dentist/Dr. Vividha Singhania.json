My parents hadn't got a dental check up for last 50 years and we discovered whole lot of issues which had hid from me as well. Within 6 months, with various weekly sessions, Dr. Vividha ensured that their set of teeth is worked upon well (root canal, filling, cleaning and fitting new tooth n caps along) so that they do not have any future trouble. The style of doctor's treatment is so warm and personalized that patients need not worry even a bit about pain or stress within treatment. And after a couple of conversations with doctor, one feels as if we have known the doctor for long. That's an immaculate quality all doctors should have.  My parents do not have any dental issues anymore and do a 6 monthly visit check with Dr. Vividha. \nAnd 4 months back, I had personally visited for root canal and tooth breakage. Dr. Vividha was very accommodating with timing as I have erratic work timing and also I am scared of any procedures with needles or tools.  Was really happy that my procedures were done in 3 sittings and the doctor made me comfortable to ensure i do not panic, going to the extent of playing old bollywood songs I like.  And yes, the pain was hardly a bit after anesthesia wore off.  I have learnt my lesson on  dental hygiene with half yearly visits scheduled to the dentist. I highly recommend Dr. Vividha  to dental patients of all ages. Dr. Vividha will recommend the right treatment and make sure the issues are corrected for good. Thank you very much Dr. Vividha",

My husband had a wisdom tooth extraction - his tooth was fully grown and rotting.  The extraction was painless and healed beautifully.  Dr. Singhania took time to explain and show to us what was needed for our teeth, what to do post appointment, what we should do to better care for our teeth, and also how we can avoid future issues.  She also made her self available to us via whatsapp if we have any questions or need anything else.  My husband and I were on a very tight schedule to to travel plans and she was very accommodating to our schedule and made sure that we were able to get everything that we needed done. We were able to get appointments easily. It was our first time going to her and she was the best experience we've had with a dentist to date.  She is professional, and clearly knows her trade.  In addition to the wisdom tooth extraction for my husband, she did a cleaning for both of us and fillings that matched our teeth colour.  I had one tooth that was bugging me from a previous filling (it was scraping against my gum) and she was able to see right away what needed to be done when I told her and fixed it perfectly. She really took the time to make sure that our fillings were comfortable too.  We liked that she did not try to push anything on us that was not needed and would definitely go back.",

It was then i thought i should visit a dentist.\nHad an appointment with Dr Vividha singhania. \nI was asked to take OPG x ray(full teeth x ray-650rs). \nThe next day the tooth extraction procedure was carried out. Over all the procedure was completely painless with inconvenience here and there. \n\nI was right back to work the next day. \nThough the cost is a little higher compared to others but it was ok with me as it was nearby to my work place and I could get back to work right after extraction.\nJust ensure to follow the  instructions on food and medication (antibiotics, painkiller and mouth gargle) given by her and every thing will go smooth.\n\nHer communication with patients was good. \nDos and don't were clearly explained.\nFree Followups were also offered.",

My parents hadn't got a dental check up for last 50 years and we discovered whole lot of issues which had hid from me as well. Within 6 months, with various weekly sessions, Dr. Vividha ensured that their set of teeth is worked upon well (root canal, filling, cleaning and fitting new tooth n caps along) so that they do not have any future trouble. The style of doctor's treatment is so warm and personalized that patients need not worry even a bit about pain or stress within treatment. And after a couple of conversations with doctor, one feels as if we have known the doctor for long. That's an immaculate quality all doctors should have.  My parents do not have any dental issues anymore and do a 6 monthly visit check with Dr. Vividha. \nAnd 4 months back, I had personally visited for root canal and tooth breakage. Dr. Vividha was very accommodating with timing as I have erratic work timing and also I am scared of any procedures with needles or tools.  Was really happy that my procedures were done in 3 sittings and the doctor made me comfortable to ensure i do not panic, going to the extent of playing old bollywood songs I like.  And yes, the pain was hardly a bit after anesthesia wore off.  I have learnt my lesson on  dental hygiene with half yearly visits scheduled to the dentist. I highly recommend Dr. Vividha  to dental patients of all ages. Dr. Vividha will recommend the right treatment and make sure the issues are corrected for good. Thank you very much Dr. Vividha",

My husband had a wisdom tooth extraction - his tooth was fully grown and rotting.  The extraction was painless and healed beautifully.  Dr. Singhania took time to explain and show to us what was needed for our teeth, what to do post appointment, what we should do to better care for our teeth, and also how we can avoid future issues.  She also made her self available to us via whatsapp if we have any questions or need anything else.  My husband and I were on a very tight schedule to to travel plans and she was very accommodating to our schedule and made sure that we were able to get everything that we needed done. We were able to get appointments easily. It was our first time going to her and she was the best experience we've had with a dentist to date.  She is professional, and clearly knows her trade.  In addition to the wisdom tooth extraction for my husband, she did a cleaning for both of us and fillings that matched our teeth colour.  I had one tooth that was bugging me from a previous filling (it was scraping against my gum) and she was able to see right away what needed to be done when I told her and fixed it perfectly. She really took the time to make sure that our fillings were comfortable too.  We liked that she did not try to push anything on us that was not needed and would definitely go back.",

Dr.Vividha is also so confident about her work..she actually finishes everything so smoothly and swiftly..that's what I really liked about her..\n",
