In my First visit the condition of my teeth were checked within a matter of
minutes. A detailed study like Initial Analysis of my health condition and
conditions of the teeth, Duration of Treatment, Mode and method of approach
required in extractions, root canal, implantation etc was done by the Drs. and I
was informed of the treatment cost keeping in view of my affordability and
procedures were explained in detail. My very first visit to the Dr. Aditi Lele‚Äôs, Smiles Forever Clinic at Dadar ‚Äì Mumbai, Veer Savarkar Marg, gave me lots and lots of confidence. 
In every appointment right from the first I was made to feel welcome and
comfortable both by the friendly competence of the staff and the pleasant, clean environment of the offiice itself. I underwent several tooth extractions, root canal treatments and six teeth implants. Dr. Aditi Lele and all the Doctors inspire the utmost confidence by wealth of
knowledge, skill, and professionalism. Latest Digital technologies are used in
the process of Implants. Painless treatments during tooth extractions and
implantation. Absolutely no pain both mentally and physically. Kudos and the highest recommendation to Dr. Aditi Lele and All the Dr‚Äôs at
Smiles Forever Clinic. Last but not the least the exit drink after every appointment like coffee, Lassi
were very soothing to both mind and body. Thank you Doctors, Wish you lots of Happiness, Strong Health and lots of
