I believe the treatment progressed smoothly and our specialist was able to negotiate the previously untreated part left by your previous dentist as planned.We were suspicious of additional root canal bring present due to the anatomy of additional root as seen on the xrays.Hence, we suggested(not mandated you)to have a CBCT for one of the involved tooth just to be 100%sure that no canals are left untreated before we complete the treatment.CBCT scans allow 3 D visualization of the tooth anatomy and allow the clinician to locate any anomalous canals virtually on computer screen.This not only enhances the quality of work,conserves tooth structure in finding the canals but also to ensure that you have no issues going further.Root canal is two part process-cleaning and shaping followed by filling the canal with inert material.Systems used by different dentist would vary.Thus requiring the other dentist to reshape the canals according to the system he uses.(we would have to the same if any patient comes to us ) We did try to contact you multiple occasion to understand the concern and reassure you but you never got back after completing your 1st appointment.Its unfortunate that you think we did not meet your expectations.We stand by our specialist and his opinion.I am also sure the current dentist would be happy as our specialist has made his life easy completing the actual difficult part of root canal of negotiating till the optimal length of the canal.",2018-12-11T15:22:18+0000,Dr. Shantanu Jambhekar
