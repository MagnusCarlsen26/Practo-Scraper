I was petrified on day 1, but got so much confidence in the doc & got so comfortable, that the next two visits were a breeze. \n\nDr. Shravan is an artist & one of the best thing about him is that he explains everything in detail, so you know exactly what it happening at every stage.. and of course, post my treatment, I smile much more & my smile has become much wider... \n\nFor all you people who are scared of dentists & needles, you will be a different person after just the 1st sitting at Bay Dental. \n\n",
