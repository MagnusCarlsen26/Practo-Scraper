"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Extremely friendly Doctor team who patiently explained the entire procedure before beginning the same and constantly kept telling me at what stage we were at.  ******** ******* ***** **** ensured minimal pain (Dental pain is not zero- let no one tell you otherwise) and very patient reassurances during the entire procedure

During the pandemic times, this place is highly recommended for the sheer precautionary measures they follow, and the strong hygiene rules, that ensures safety for all. 

The cost is well worth the entire procedure and I would most definitely recommend this clinic JAWS-N-JOINTS  at Ghatkopar; without any hesitation. It is definitely worth yr travel time from wherever you are based out of in Mumbai.
