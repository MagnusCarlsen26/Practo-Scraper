We were taken in apt ON TIME. \nThey had asked us to fill a form which asked for our details, our problem, medications etc. Thus they knew about us before we even meeting them and they can check accordingly.\nAs soon as we entered,  the doctors were all set and ready to examine. \nBoth the head doctors \u2013 Dr. Sneh and Dr. Tuhina \u2013 are extremely calm and friendly.\nThey closely examined the entire case, explained us the situation, the various options that would be possible and also told us the factors that should be seen while selecting the options. They were able to communicate it so lucidly that it helps a common man to understand the problem and then make a sound and informed decision. \nWe can easily make out \u2013 that for them \u2013 patient\u2019s convenience and his satisfaction with the treatment- are the 2 sole objectives.\nWe are looking forward for the balance part of treatment with them\u2026.\n\nFROM enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis and increasing patients knowledge - TO - maintaining a good patient\u2019s -doctor\u2019s relationship , AND as being one stop solution for all your dental problems -  GUMS AND BRACES EARNS MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION !!!\nCA.

We were taken in apt ON TIME. \nThey had asked us to fill a form which asked for our details, our problem, medications etc. Thus they knew about us before we even meeting them and they can check accordingly.\nAs soon as we entered,  the doctors were all set and ready to examine. \nBoth the head doctors \u2013 Dr. Sneh and Dr. Tuhina \u2013 are extremely calm and friendly.\nThey closely examined the entire case, explained us the situation, the various options that would be possible and also told us the factors that should be seen while selecting the options. They were able to communicate it so lucidly that it helps a common man to understand the problem and then make a sound and informed decision. \nWe can easily make out \u2013 that for them \u2013 patient\u2019s convenience and his satisfaction with the treatment- are the 2 sole objectives.\nWe are looking forward for the balance part of treatment with them\u2026.\n\nFROM enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis and increasing patients knowledge - TO - maintaining a good patient\u2019s -doctor\u2019s relationship , AND as being one stop solution for all your dental problems -  GUMS AND BRACES EARNS MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION !!!\nCA.
