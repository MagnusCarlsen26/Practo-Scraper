None,None,0,0,YES,"I and my family are associated with wondersmile clinic for more than 20 yrs. This itself is an indication of highly successful and satisfactory treatment, I received from the clinic. Our dental health problem was so grave & of varied type in nature such as cavity feeling, root canal treatment, crown, bridges,gum treatment ,etc. detoriorated beyond the point but to our great surprise and satisfaction most of the problems were solved, as if giving us new lease of life. All this has happened because of Dr.Kamdar and wondersmile clinic. Truly this is precious gift in the form of wonderful smile on our face  by wondersmile clinic. We sincerly owe it to them.

Wondersmile clinic is centrally located ,spacious ,airy, and well furnished.  It is very well equipped with excellent facilities  and operates in  warm, co-ordial  clean, hygienic  environment by well trained staff so as to provide all sorts of dental health treatment under one roof. They do send regular alerts, SMS, remainder for our appointment.

Both Dr.Kamdar are highly experienced, qualified,skilled professional enjoying high expertise in their own field. Dr.Stimita Kamdar is very passionate about dentistry. A perfectionist by nature, she takes her work very seriously and always wants the best results out of what she does,just as we do/expect. Because of this one feels very secure and with lots of ease around her so as to form trust and certain level of comfort with DR. A perfectionist attitude, practical approach, dedicated efforts, honest opinion,excellent satisfactory treatment  has always made us comfortable in the difficult days of anxiety and worry due to dental health problems. All this are basic characteristic of dr.Stimita Kamdar that brings  wonder smile on our face.
We consider ourselves extremely lucky to have been treated at wondersmile clinic with utmost satisfaction. I can't express it in words as I appreciate dr.Kamdar and wondersmile clinic more than words could ever say . I sincerely thank them to let them know that they are the best and I wish them all the best. 

I strongly recommend wondersmile clinic to all, so as to wear wonder smile on their face forever .
