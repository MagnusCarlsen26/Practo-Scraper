"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Teeth Whitening,",0,0,YES,"Dr Richa was wonderful. She was incredible professional and made me feel safe during the teeth whitening session. My teeth were the perfect shade, not too bleached white but enough to look natural and clean.
