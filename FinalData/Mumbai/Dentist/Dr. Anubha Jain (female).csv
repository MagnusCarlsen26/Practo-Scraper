None,"Health Checkup (General),Cavities,Scaling / Polishing,",0,0,YES,"Dr Anubha Jain was flawless, at first I was quite reluctant and anxious because I hadn't visited a dentist over 5 years and thought that I'll have a lot of issues, but she was excellent at her work and spent over an hour to scale and polish my teeth to perfection and also filled my cavity to perfection, also she did make sure to call and follow up to make sure I had no post procedure issues.

It was my first experience at opus and with Dr Jain.
She also explained me the wear and tear and also adviced me as per what other issues might occur later.
The best part was she was passionate and dedicated about her work and dint act one bit commercial unlike other places.
I would rate Dr Jain 10/10. And will recommend every one to go to her for any dental issues.

Thank you 

Dr Jain and Opus

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Anubha Jain is very professional, yet calming. She patiently explained me the diagnosis and happily answered all my questions. The treatment itself was done very meticulously, and I'm happy with the result. 

The biggest positive for me was you can tell the doctor actually cares for the patient, rather than just carrying out a procedure, or trying to recommend expensive treatments, as is the case with many doctors these days. It allowed me to trust that I am in good hands. 

The clinic is spacious, and has a good number of assistant helpers as well, all actually concerned about the patient.
