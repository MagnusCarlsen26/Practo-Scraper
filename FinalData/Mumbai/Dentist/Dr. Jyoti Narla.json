Dr. Jyoti made this entire scary sounding procedure almost painless. Her clinic is one stop solution for all dental problems. Doctors and staff are well versed with their work and have all advanced machineries to carry out complicated procedures. Their behavior and explanation of the procedure is excellent.\n\nI would recommend 'Cosmodent'  and Dr. Jyoti as well as Dr. Anand Narla (for braces) to all in need of a dental problem.",

It was Dr Jothi and Dr. Anand  @ Cosmodent Clinic (Chandivali, Powai) that explained the root cause (Deep Bite condition) and recommended  appropriate solution. They simplified my trauma to a great degree, and so I am forever thankful to them. Dr. Jyoti is a Gum Surgen, and Dr Anand an Orthodontic Specialist. Both are thorough professionals in their respective spaces. They will be my dentists forever.",

Doctors and staff are well versed with their work and have all advanced machineries to carry out complicated procedures. Their behavior and explanation of the procedure is excellent.\n\nI would recommend 'Cosmodent'  and Dr. Jyoti as well as Dr. Anand Narla (for braces) to all in need of a dental problem.",

Given my persistent teeth issue (which also led to bad breath and extreme sensitivity) I had consulted multiple dentists in the past. It was Dr Jothi and Dr. Anand  @ Cosmodent Clinic (Chandivali, Powai) that explained the root cause (Deep Bite condition) and recommended  appropriate solution. They simplified my trauma to a great degree, and so I am forever thankful to them. Dr. Jyoti is a Gum Surgen, and Dr Anand an Orthodontic Specialist. Both are thorough professionals in their respective spaces. They will be my dentists forever.",

Now the dental treatment starts. * **** *** **** *** ** *** **** ******* ** *** *** **** * **** ********** ******** She understands the concerns, explains do's and don'ts and has the most advanced technologies for a pain free dental experience. I am very happy with her treatments. Her clinic is also spot clean and staff and ambience is very welcoming. I think I have found the dentist I was looking for who does minimal damage to my teeth and pocket! Thank you Dr Jyoti. I highly recommend her for any dental work related to teeth, gums and dental health.",

Overall I spent about 40,000 Rs on the treatment and totally regret it. There are way better dentists around if you want to spend that much.",

But the providence of God in Dr Jyoti, who was brilliant and adept in treating it- I had no pain even post the treatment last night, coz she advised me to have the pain killer before the anaesthesia wears off, I am going in to get the cap set . Dr. Jyoti with her professional touch and efficiency, totally settled my anxiety about this treatment and now I have a testimony different from the ones have heard. Am so grateful. I would definitely recommend Dr Jyoti at Cosmodent and the patience she has \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffcWith answering whatever questions I had out of anxiety. Thank you",

It was a very kind gesture and I felt glad I had gone back to her...she is very understanding of a situation...she does her job in a very calm and patient manner and my dad too is quite relaxed during these sessions which is wonderful!

Even during my first visit, Jyoti Mam was able to gauge the exact difficulties which I was facing in front teeth. With the kind of friendliness ever thought of, she handled all steps of such dental surgeries very carefully and promptly. The exact treatment what you want with the timelines guided was provided. And the same continues even today. She remembers which tooth surgery was done earlier. And with the same treatment appropriateness, she handled all carefully in the required manner. Hats Off!! I owe to you a lot!! My family or my friends will come to Cosmodent Powai for any dental treatments, wherever we all live in Mumbai.",

Team of professional staff. What impressed me the most is the time Dr. Narla devoted and was never in a hurry to ensure that entire experience is painless and to perfection. \nI would strongly recommend Cosmodent to all seeking dental treatment. Don\u2019t go by the sky rocketing obnoxious prices that are quoted by other Dr\u2019s/Hospitals and get a check done at this clinic. You won\u2019t repent my suggestion out of my experience.",
