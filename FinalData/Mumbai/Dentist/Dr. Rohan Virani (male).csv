"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant Fixing,Dental Crowns,",0,0,YES,"About a year back my molar tooth implant failed and had to be removed. Further I was informed that a new implant could not be fitted as my jaw bone had shrunk and did not have the necessary width / height for placing the implant. I was therefore advised to undergo a bone augmentation surgery first and wait for about 6 to 12 months for placement of implant and further wait for 4 to 6 months for fitting of the tooth crown. Considering the  trauma of undergoing a bone augmentation surgery of as well as the cost and time aspects, I was not keen on this option.

In the meantime another root canal treated molar on the opposite side fractured  and I started having difficulty in eating normally as I could not chew properly on either side of my mouth. When I started searching the net in desperation for alternate solutions for my predicament, I came across some research articles on cortical bone implants used in orthopedics and their application in modern dentistry in the form of 'Basal Cortical Screw' or BCS dental implants that are placed deep in the cortical or dense bone. Since the cortical bone is available even in relatively atrophied jaws, it provides a viable alternative to the traditional bone augmentation route. 

Encouraged with this information, I then started searching for dentists in Mumbai offering the Basal type implants and was fortunate to come upon Dr Rohan Virani's clinic - Trissa Dental Solutions located in Mulund, Mumbai. I immediately requested for an appointment with Dr. Rohan Virani. On studying my case and examining the X Rays, he assured me that the Swiss BCS Cortical Implants can be placed in my jaw directly without any bone augmentation surgery. I was greatly relieved to hear this and agreed to undergo the implant procedure. I did not experience any pain or discomfort during the treatment and got my teeth crowns in about three days after placement of the implant! There were no stitches to heal, no waiting time for implant to be integrated into the gums and no extra expenses for bone augmentation surgery! 

Thanks to Dr Rohan Virani and his team of doctors, I am able to eat normally today. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Dr Rohan Virani for any person suffering from dental problems as above.
