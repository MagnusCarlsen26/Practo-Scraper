Redoing a failed root canal is not an easy job. It requires special skill hence it is more expensive than doing a regular root canal. It requires many more sittings too. The cost that you mentioned is misleading. It is not of the root canal alone but the entire treatment for that tooth including the crown.
Thank you for appreciating that we are good at our work.
