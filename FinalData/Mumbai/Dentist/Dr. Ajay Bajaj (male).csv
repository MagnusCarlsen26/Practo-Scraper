"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"Went to Dr.Bajaju2019s clinic after reading reviews online for my root canal in June.
Lets start with clinic
1)      It is well managed with lot of staff
2)      You get appointment reminders on the phone and your also kept informed by call in case of any changes to your appointment
3)      Clinic is clean and well kept
4)      Material used on good quality
 
Treatment experience
1)      Dr. Bajaj is very polite and pleasant, explained me what was the process on the treatment and the cost.
2)      So after doing the RC on my one affected tooth which I was suffering from last 4 months as I was aboard travelling and could not afford to carry out treatment aboard was great pain relief.
3)      On the same day he ask me to carry out full scan on all my teethu2019s to see any problem with other teethu2019s
4)      Scan result showed one new RC and one failed old RC to be redone and one filling.
 
 
So one more new RC was done after 2 days, As I had only a week in Mumbai before going away treatment was planned for August on all the teeth when I was back in Mumbai for 3 weeks.
 
So back in August on the first day one more RC was done, on the same day I ask to get the other small filling to be done. But Dr did not have time becoz of his other booking, some how the small filling was pushed to last 4 days of me in Mumbai.
 
On the day on small filing Dr. Bajaj removed the old filling and put temporary filling and ask me come back after 2 days for final filling, on the final filling day which was my second last day in Mumbai he inspected the tooth and asked his assistant to complete the filling.
 
And now the trouble started, she I think is not trained and did not knew what she was doing and could not remove the temporary filling and two times she did something that caused lot of pain to me.  At the end Dr. bajaj had to come back to finish the teeth, but damage was done.
 
The tooth had started paining after treatment which was not happening before, I went to the clinic next day as I was flying aboard the day after, the assistant and all the helper where relaxing in the clinic and atmosphere was not at all professional as Dr. Bajaj was not in the clinic, she said let me take the Xray and then said Oh! this is root canal, so I am thinking why did you not take this Xray yesterday and check what you have done.  utterly unprofessional. Till date the tooth is hurting me and I cannot get the treatment done as I am aboard for next 5 months.
 
Now I am back to square one where I was in July, this is after spending 25000 rupees and 7 visits.
 
Cons: 1) donu2019t get any treatment done by the assistantu2019s.
2) Slow treatment plan
3) very expensive
     
Pros: Dr. Bajaj is very good in what he is doing
2) material used are of good quality

None,None,0,0,YES,"Dear readers, below are my true experience. Not a single element of exaggeration is added to it.
I am  student of SPJIMR. After joining the course I developed a sporadic pain in tooth. I did not pay much attention to it. During a short vacation I went back to my home in Kolkata and gave a send thought to it and visited a dentist. He advised me to go for root canal. He said it will take 2 appointments but a duration of 1 week in between. Then I searched in internet for a dentist in around West Andheri. Practo topped the search mainly because it was the most searched or visited portal in this space. However, I went through couple of reviews and got convinced that this was exactly the dental clinic that I was looking for. Mostly it was because of the reviews about Dr. Ajay Bajaj. His vast  experience in this domain,various patient's experience (through reviews in the site) in undergoing painless RC treatment and other major treatments in dental space carried by him made me believe that I should take the appointment right away. My main intention was not only to have a painless experience while undergoing RC but to have a effective solution to my problems. I booked my dates and visited the clinic. I was warmly greeted by Dr. Ajaj Bajaj. Dr. Nishi Bajaj initially inspected my tooth and they both consulted and told me to got for RC. I explained my constraints (as I was suppose to travel within 2 weeks to US for a exchange program), so they to start RC proceedings immediately that evening itself. I did not expect the proceedings to happen so fast. Dr. Ajay did the RC flawlessly and truly speaking never had pain during or after the RC. Post RC, I went through couple of filling in other tooth as well. I felt both of the doctors were very experienced in their profession. They took utmost care in whatever big or small treatments they did and with perfection. Surprising to see their consulting charges was so nominal. But there were no dearth of quality services.

My treatment with other dentist was going on for almost 2 years during which I underwent extreme pain. I was referred to him when no dentists could handle my case. I had undergone a root canal but the tooth ache wouldn't subside. Dr. Bajaj evaluated my case patiently and tried to figure the issue. After several x-rays he found the root cause of my misery. My wisdom tooth was the problem, it required root canal with decay on three places. 
Dr. Bajaj conducted a root canal in single sitting. It was a twisted surgery, not an easy one to handle, gladly it was successful and me had my bridge too. Before I met Dr. Bajaj I was mentally drained about my dental issue. Today after his treatment I got my Smile back. Thanks to Smilez Unlimited, they truly live up to their name.
