"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"This clinic is extremely modern - in fact the best I've seen. I couldn't have imagined such a set up in Mumbai. 

The spaciousness, hygiene, and privacy, and the state of the art tools all readily available in house, made a big difference to my experience, even compared to clinics in the US. 

Having parking for patients in the vast compound itself is a big plus. 

The procedure was quite reasonably priced compared to some other options in Mumbai. The doctor did only what was absolutely necessary, and left me with good advice to keep my teeth naturally healthy.  

Most of all, the doctor's skill and communication kept me completely at ease throughout the procedure. It was a surprisingly painless experience! 

The doctor is approachable and kind. I highly recommend!",2024-08-01 17:19:29,False,True,Vishesh,,,
