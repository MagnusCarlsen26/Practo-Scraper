"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,"," Tooth Extraction,Dental Cavity Filling,",0,0,YES,"Dr Sonal was very kind of accommodate me for a tooth extraction, in spite of having a family vacation plan. 

The tooth extraction was painless. Within a minute the tooth was out and I did not even realize.

Dr. Sonal followed up with me while on her holiday making sure there was no pain or bleeding. 

Its rare to find such a dedicated Dr in today's time. Everyone is just so focused on their fees and nothing more.
