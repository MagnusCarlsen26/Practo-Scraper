Whenever I've had any emergencies, she has been quick to respond and tried to accommodate my schedule.

After my wisdom tooth extraction I was prescribed NSAIDs, after which I started feeling unwell. I immediately called the doctor, and she was quick to diagnose that I'm allergic to NSAIDs and put me on a different course immediately. 

I wouldn't have known of this if it wasn't for Dr Shruti's quick diagnosis.
