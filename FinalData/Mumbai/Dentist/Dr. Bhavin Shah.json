If you value your money and your time - Don't book a slot with Dr. Bhavin Shah. When Ms. Payal at front desk or doctor explains about charges, keep a notebook nearby and record the conversation.

After a consultation with Dr. Bhavin a few weeks ago I was confident that I had come to the right place and found the right dentist. I have been through dental in the past three years and I never imagined that I could feel so comfortable and reassured. Making the decision to receive my care here was easy for me. The procedure was smooth, fast and painless!! All three were a bonus for me. Dr. Bhavin is at the top of his game - he is thoughtful and caring. I felt at ease as soon as I sat in the chair. I would recommend this practice to anyone I know who needs this kind of dental care. The cost is reasonable and affordable. What a great experience! The office is large, bright and clean. There is such a good vibe here. Everyone is professional and courteous.",
