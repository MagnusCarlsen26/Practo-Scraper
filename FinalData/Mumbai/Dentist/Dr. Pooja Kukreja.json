The next day i was ready for my root canal & again without any complaint she handle me like my mother :) it was an honor to meet such a doctor these days who cares too much about you. Soo before getting started with my root canal she asked me if u will have pain then raise your hand we will stop for a minute or two. Soo the treatment started. Whenever i was having a pain she immediately stopped treatment & gave me some minutes to rest. That was very humble to her. Overall i want to say that Dr. Pooja is a great dentist i love her work & also her smile :D Make everyone smile Dr. Pooja",

The next day i was ready for my root canal & again without any complaint she handle me like my mother :) it was an honor to meet such a doctor these days who cares too much about you. Soo before getting started with my root canal she asked me if u will have pain then raise your hand we will stop for a minute or two. Soo the treatment started. Whenever i was having a pain she immediately stopped treatment & gave me some minutes to rest. That was very humble to her. Overall i want to say that Dr. Pooja is a great dentist i love her work & also her smile :D Make everyone smile Dr. Pooja",
