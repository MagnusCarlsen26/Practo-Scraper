Dr. Ritu's meticulous attention to detail and artistic touch ensured that my restored tooth blended seamlessly with the rest of my smile.

Not only did Dr. Ritu deliver exceptional results, but she also made the entire experience comfortable and stress-free. Her friendly demeanor and gentle approach instantly put me at ease, making each visit to her clinic a pleasant and enjoyable experience.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"Highly recommend Dr Ritu for any sort of dental treatments. We have been consulting Dr Ritu from 2015, when she was practicing in Delhi, especially for our son who was 5 then.
We did find Dr Ritu very considerate at our very first visit. Not only she would explain the whole problem very well but would go an extra mile seeking expert opinion from her colleagues and other specialists. This is not something a normal practitioner would do as they would simply refer you to other specialists. We were highly impressed by her friendly and super down to earth nature as she provided the consultation as a friend. And as usually told, if your doctor is considerate and friendly, it is half cure done automatically. That is exactly the case with Dr Ritu.
After 2017,  we moved to Australia and have been seeing the Dentists here as our son has now grown to 11. We were not very confident with the solutions to our problem being suggested here and were looking to seek other opinion when we gathered the thought of consulting Dr Ritu again.  We called her to seek an online appointment and I should not say that to our utter surprise, but kind of expectedly, she was straight away able to recognise us and had a complete remembrance of the whole case even though it had been more than 5 years since we had consulted her. Neither did she very patiently listened to our problem but as always, did explain everything to us in detail, got the case discussed with her specialists panel and came back to us with the right solution. And for all this to happen, it did not take weeks or months, but all on  the same day within hours of consulting her again. We managed to get so much more details and options that we can now discuss with doctors here in Australia.Dr Ritu really cares for her patients and leaves no stone unturned to get to the best possible treatment.
Even though she would have reached to the next level of her career over these years but her way of treating her patients has not changed a bit.
We are really thankful to her for consultations there in Delhi and now from here in Australia. ",2021-12-19 09:24:49,False,True,Harsh Pruthi,"Wow.

While he was having antibiotics (18-20)tablets in total as advisd a doc(apparently extremely high!!), but it wasn't giving any relief. Swelling, lack of sleep + diabetes also worsened and we decided to have 2nd opinion urgently.

That's when we came across Dr. Ritu who gave acmdtd last min request. She quickly identified the issue, did a quick scan and explained the situation.

After the root canal, my mother is feeling very relaxed and not a single bit of pain is left. Moreover She has filled the tooth with permanent filling which is exactly the same color as of tooth that's why you can't say by looking at the tooth that it has undergone some treatment.

I finally got a chance to visit her clinic after she resumed work in August.
