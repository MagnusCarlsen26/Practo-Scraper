None,"Toothache,",0,0,YES,I don't know how to start but still i will write about Dr. Pooja she's a kind girl & an awesome Doctor she treat's her patient like they are friends i visted her clinic (Dr. Manoj's clinic) in Khar West & at 1st i was feeling shy that how to talk to her but then she started talking to me & started asking what problems u have soo i decided to share my tooth problem she handle me with care & she explained me everything about Root canal & other useful things but i didn't understand a thing :p (sorry if you are reading this Dr. Pooja) then she took my X-ray with ease. The next day i was ready for my root canal & again without any complaint she handle me like my mother :) it was an honor to meet such a doctor these days who cares too much about you. Soo before getting started with my root canal she asked me if u will have pain then raise your hand we will stop for a minute or two. Soo the treatment started. Whenever i was having a pain she immediately stopped treatment & gave me some minutes to rest. That was very humble to her. Overall i want to say that Dr. Pooja is a great dentist i love her work & also her smile :D Make everyone smile Dr. Pooja,2016-06-29 14:39:21,False,True,Suraj Dasila,,,
