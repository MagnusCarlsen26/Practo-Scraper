Dr. Prachi thoroughly examined my teeth using latest technology and recommended a root canal for the paining tooth. She also showed me images of my other teeth and recommended filling a few other cavities so that the decay in them gets arrested in time. I took all her suggestions. The skills of Dr. Prachi combined with the use of best in class technology made the experience completely painless.\nI highly recommend Dr. Prachi to anyone looking out for a treatment of their dental problems and also to anyone wanting to maintain their dental hygiene by doing regular checks.",

She followed up post the procedure for few days until I confirmed that \u201call well\u201d which resulted in i having 31 teeth left instead of 30 . \n\nThanks Dr.Prachi for being an honest medical practitioner and not treating your work as vyapaar(practo doesn\u2019t allow english transalation of this word) unlike many in that industry which i am saying with experience.",

She is so thorough and informative, and lets you know at every step what\u2019s going on so there are no surprises. She did a great job with my tooth extraction with minimal pain and also shared the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts   post the treatment which was very helpful. By far the best dental experience I\u2019ve ever had.  A very hygienic clinic with all facilities. \n",

I had visited her for my wisdom tooth extraction before starting with the procedure she explained me thoroughly the problem with all the fancy looking tech instruments she has in her clinic and advised me for an extraction for one of my wisdom tooth and treated the other tooth without extraction and that is what i really appreciated about her that she didn\u2019t try to extract the other one(which is the easier part of treatment i assume) but conviced me that she shall not extract the other one but treated it and wait for few days for observation. She followed up post the procedure for few days until I confirmed that \u201call well\u201d which resulted in i having 31 teeth left instead of 30 . \n\nThanks Dr.Prachi for being an honest medical practitioner and not treating your work as vyapaar(practo doesn\u2019t allow english transalation of this word) unlike many in that industry which i am saying with experience.",
