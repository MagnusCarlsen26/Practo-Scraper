I had a severe case of overcrowding and deep bite which made chewing difficult and looked awful. I opted for the Invisalign route for my treatment and the results achieved within just 6 months are phenomenal.

They were quick to respond to my queries and guided me through the nitty gritties of my treatment with the help of accurate simulations.

Timings of my appointments were made very flexible which was especially important for me as my work kept me mostly out of station. They also kept monitoring my progress on phone and always reminded me of my upcoming sittings even if I forgot.(even after I had paid the treatment fees, which was also very nominal).

In addition to the above, seeing smiling warm faces who patiently hear out all your trivial queries is a departure from the stereotypical grumpy old impatient dentists with bad handwriting you may sometimes come across.
