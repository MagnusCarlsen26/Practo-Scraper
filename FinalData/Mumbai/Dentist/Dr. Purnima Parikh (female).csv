"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Purnima was extremely warm and made me feel at ease immediately. I really liked that she explained the procedure that I was undergoing in detail beforehand. She comforted me throughout the procedure, and it felt far easier and quicker than it's supposed to be. Her post-extraction guidance and follow-ups were thorough and helpful, and helped me recover much better!

DO NOT VISIT her !!!",2020-09-14 07:23:07,False,False,Neitika Reddy,"This patient was clearly informed the line of treatment and my charges before starting the extraction. At the end of the procedure, she was asked to wait in my consulting room instead of the reception room for social distancing as per Covid protocol. The patient’s health was observed for about 15 minutes before she left and the recovery was uneventful.  She was not asked to leave the clinic at any time. 

BTW this person’s daughter woke me up on three consecutive nights even prior to consultation (and without any reference) but was politely advised on each instance and no night consultation charges were asked for.

Such a disheartening feedback discourages a doctor to go out of the way and help new patients without references.",2020-09-14T14:18:38+0000,Dr. Purnima Parikh
