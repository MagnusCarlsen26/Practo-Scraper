,,0,0,NO,"Horrible service *** ****** **** **** **** ****** ** ** ***** I wouldn't recommend Dr Parikh to anyone. I had taken my mother for severe tooth ache to her and she extracted the tooth ***** *** *** **** *** ******* ****** *** ********** *** **** ******* ****** ********** ***** ********* *** **** ** ****** *** ********* ****** ******* ** **** ******** ****** She was so horrified with the Covid situation she did not allow my mother to sit in the clinic post the extraction and asked us to leave *** *** *********** **** *** ***** ** *** ****** ******** *** ******* *** ** *** **** *** ***** ************* ********* For all of this she charged me ****** *** *** when I called her to give her feedback what she tells me in return is ""Go do whatever you want"". DO NOT VISIT her !!!",2020-09-14 07:23:07,False,False,Neitika Reddy,"This patient was clearly informed the line of treatment and my charges before starting the extraction. At the end of the procedure, she was asked to wait in my consulting room instead of the reception room for social distancing as per Covid protocol. The patient’s health was observed for about 15 minutes before she left and the recovery was uneventful.  She was not asked to leave the clinic at any time. 

BTW this person’s daughter woke me up on three consecutive nights even prior to consultation (and without any reference) but was politely advised on each instance and no night consultation charges were asked for.

Such a disheartening feedback discourages a doctor to go out of the way and help new patients without references.",2020-09-14T14:18:38+0000,Dr. Purnima Parikh
