None,None,0,0,YES,It's been almost 2 years we have been visiting Dr. Anuj Shah. My daughter was not even a year when we visited him first and trust me when I say this  I felt  she was in safe hands he was so gentle and calm with her. And children being children are always upto something but he asked me to just leave her and let her do whatever she wanted to while he sat and answered all my questions with out asking me to hurry up and trying to just finish up the appointment. He appreciated me for whatever I was doing with my baby and gave me few tip on how I can maintain her oral hygiene since she was still on milk. He is the sweetest piditric doctor we have visited just how a child's doc is expected to be he has been so good with my Daughter everytime we visited him. Whenever I have had a doubt or when my baby was teething and was in pain crying not eating if I msged him he has gone out of his way and called me personally to tell me what to do and followed up and this quality is very rare to find in any doctors these days. Thank you so much doctor for your time and service you provide us.,2024-02-16 07:26:16,False,True,Sneha Gonsalves,,,
