,,0,0,Yes,I have booked appointment and visited the clinic. Dr. Jyothi was very good with me and she had done my check up. After that medicines had prescribed me to take. There was no waiting time for me in clinic and staff were cooperative and responsive with me. I would like to recommend this doctor for friends and family members also.  ,2021-11-11 09:18:28,False,True,Verified Patient,"Thank you for the gratifying response.
So glad you had a pleasant experience !!",2024-04-15T12:13:27+0000,Dr. Jyoti Shetty
,,0,0,NO,"**** ******* no complains with her advice throughout the 7 months. But the below red flags left us very disturbed and unhappy, and the relationship ended very sour:
1. Never picks up calls of patient or relative. ****** *** *** **** ** *** ***** *** doesn't even bother to call back in most cases. ****** she is only advising the mother **** ****** *** ****** **** **** *** **** ****** * pregnancy is a process that both parents experience!
2. 2 weeks from expected due date, we realised that she has forgotten the due date completely, when she asks us in a consultation that we have 1 month to go (and later said oh sorry I have been miscalculating)! Was shocking and scary - we started thinking if we should stick with her at all, that too at the last hour!
3. Extortion: We consulted with her for 7 months. She was aware of all history, which hospital we were planning to go for delivery, what the tariffs are etc. She never once mentioned what her expectation on ""remuneration"" was. 1 day post delivery, I (the father who she barely spoke to!) suddenly had 7 missed calls from her office and the ask was for more payment (almost double of what our insurance plan allowed via hospital bill) to be paid to her separately as a side deal in cash!When we said we weren't interested in settling this because we were not told about this beforehand, she held us for ransom and didn't clear my wife and baby's discharge from the hospital. She called me and said you need to visit my office to discuss this **** **** **** *** *** ***** *** ****** ***** *** **** ** *** ******* ****** ******** I was appalled by the behaviour - she expected me to leave my wife and 2 day old baby in the hospital to go negotiate rates on discharge day! Ultimately, had to escalate the situation to deputy dean of the hospital and finish the discharge. Extremely sour experience, with a somewhat well established doctor - would recommend patients to insist having conversation on fee expectations before getting into a long term consultation **** **** ********* ********",2021-06-06 09:23:25,False,False,Verified Patient,"I’m surprised how an educated lady let’s her husband address her grievances. 
Firstly, if your calls were NEVER answered, how did the pregnancy & labour progress smoothly?
For all the fuss you made about the “ Calls “ &  “ Due Date “ , I hope you
remember how much you INTERFERED in my treatment protocol in the
hospital.
IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY , YOUR WIFE WOULD HAVE LANDED UP WITH A
C- SECTION !!!
Secondly, if I was commercial- minded, wouldn’t a C- Section have been more lucrative for me ?
Finally, let me assure you that individuals like you make no difference at all..... we doctors will continue doing the good work ( such as  putting in all efforts to give your wife a Normal Delivery!!! ).",2021-06-10T05:45:25+0000,Dr. Jyoti Shetty
