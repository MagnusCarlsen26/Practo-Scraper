"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Termination of Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"My experience with Practo has never been great but one consultation with Dr. Renubala completely changed my opinion on this app and felt like I have to give this another try. Usually doctors are in a hurry to get done with the consultation, do not listen to the patient’s issue at hand, not patient enough to understand what’s happening on the other end. Once I took a consultation via Practo and was suggested to take scans for a normal diarrhoea and was given tons of tabs which was of no help. I had contacted Dr. Renubala to seek assistance with termination of my pregnancy and she was very patient to hear me out and assist. We connected on video call earlier which kept disconnecting and she tried multiple times to connect via audio and video and since that could not be established she sat with me through chat till all my queries were resolved. She was very patient in listening, chat was not terminated till all my queries were answerer and until she was sure I’ve got answers for what I wanted. Even with in person consultation I’ve had experience where doctors don’t want to listen and are always in a hurry to get done.
