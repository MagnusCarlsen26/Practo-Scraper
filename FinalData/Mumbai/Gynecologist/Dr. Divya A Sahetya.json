Finally after the first round of treatment of IUI, i have been blessed with a little miracle baby. We call our baby a miracle because its nothing short of miracle for me and my husband. The continuous support, checkup, follow up also needs to be mentioned here. Dr. Divya has taken care of me like a family and really she is a huge blessing for me. This happiness wouldnt knock our doors without her guidance at every step of pregnancy. ",

That should have been mentioned on Practo in the first place or in fact before the consultation began.

We had consulted several other gynac and fertility specialists but nothing helped. The comfort and guidance provided here is so much on point and she has selflessly worked on my case and kept a check on me. Finally after the first round of treatment of IUI, i have been blessed with a little miracle baby. We call our baby a miracle because its nothing short of miracle for me and my husband. The continuous support, checkup, follow up also needs to be mentioned here. Dr. Divya has taken care of me like a family and really she is a huge blessing for me. This happiness wouldnt knock our doors without her guidance at every step of pregnancy. ",

She is the most caring and genuine doctor you would come across. Unless absolutely needed, she wouldn't unnecessary put you under heavy medication. She is one of the rarest caring and kind doctor who will check on your health progress often personally while you're under treatment. You're rest assured to be taken care of for all your issues aptly. I have felt the most comfortable and relieved under her treatment. It's commendable how she cares for her individual patient's health so much, you feel you're in the best hands. ",

But then we were charged almost double the consultation fees just because doctor took time to understand the problem and then give her opinion. That's just not done. Have never seen this before wherein charges are as per the time. And after protesting, we were shown a printed notice which said that more than 20 mins of consultation will cost extra. That should have been mentioned on Practo in the first place or in fact before the consultation began. Still, time duration of any consultation can only be regulated by the doctor and not the patients, so not sure how the extra charges apply. ",
