Me and my wife consulted her during our first pregnancy and in the first consultation itself we were impressed with her approach and the way she tackled our case. We had previously been to other gynaecologists  which were much senior to her, but her way of explaining clinically relevant things to us reassured our confidence in her. My wife also had a complication in the second trimester and we were very worried. But Dr. Rima counseled my wife not only as a doctor but as a true well-wisher. Her medication, advice and all the inputs worked magically for us throughout the pregnancy. She has a very positive and caring attitude towards all her patients and goes above and beyond her medical duties to make them comfortable. I would also like to mention that her surgical skills are equally good. My mother had undergone uterus removal at her hospital (Sant Gajanan Maharaj Hospital, Ghatkopar west) and we were aware of the complications. But with her skills and precision, she made sure my mother was discharged healthy in 2 days. That time I also learnt that she cares for her patients well-being more than any other form of gains, which is a rare quality in doctors these days. I would highly recommend Dr. Rima to all the women who need guidance with anything remotely related to women health or hygiene. Thank you Dr. Rima for always being there for the women of my family. Keep up the good work and continue the selfless service.",

Me and my wife consulted her during our first pregnancy and in the first consultation itself we were impressed with her approach and the way she tackled our case. We had previously been to other gynaecologists  which were much senior to her, but her way of explaining clinically relevant things to us reassured our confidence in her. My wife also had a complication in the second trimester and we were very worried. But Dr. Rima counseled my wife not only as a doctor but as a true well-wisher. Her medication, advice and all the inputs worked magically for us throughout the pregnancy. She has a very positive and caring attitude towards all her patients and goes above and beyond her medical duties to make them comfortable. I would also like to mention that her surgical skills are equally good. My mother had undergone uterus removal at her hospital (Sant Gajanan Maharaj Hospital, Ghatkopar west) and we were aware of the complications. But with her skills and precision, she made sure my mother was discharged healthy in 2 days. That time I also learnt that she cares for her patients well-being more than any other form of gains, which is a rare quality in doctors these days. I would highly recommend Dr. Rima to all the women who need guidance with anything remotely related to women health or hygiene. Thank you Dr. Rima for always being there for the women of my family. Keep up the good work and continue the selfless service.",
