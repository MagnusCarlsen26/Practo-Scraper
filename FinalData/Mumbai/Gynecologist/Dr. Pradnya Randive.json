I had very less confidence over my body regarding efficiency to grow a life inside me...but it all vanished away with her one smile and courageous words that literally gave me breath. She's an outstanding doctor no doubt but more than that fact which I've never seen is she is like a mother sister friend everything u want to see in her she'll be that. Whatever is the situation just by her positive approach towards the same will lighten up anybody's mind from dark clouds it's a big talent of her dt I've seen only and only in her among all doctors I've met until date . such a consistent personality with down to earth behaviour is all her colour.. and she made my pregnancy colourful with the same. It's a true blessing to spend my pre and pregnancy journey with this amazing one man army WOMAN\u2764\ufe0f she's my blessing as equal as I've got my baby ...yes somewhere it's her efforts more than anyone else that I've gone through everything so smoothly. Doctors are called to be god's angels therefore I have met one.. and that's her \ud83e\udd70",

Very professional and approachable.\n\nDelivery was at Aditya Care Maternity Home, Bhandup West. This place has the best team of staff. No patient is ever alone for a moment in the labour room. Extremely courteous, helpful staff and five star treatment for their patients. You don't have to run to any other place for scans or blood test. Everything is available and at reasonable cost.\n\nDr. Pradnya is an expert when it comes to handling complicated issues as my wife had an previous abortion case and this time it was a successful normal delivery. She will go out of her way to ensure that all matters are tactfully handled proactively. Making no room for errors or delay in identifying issues. Have never seen a Doctor who forces for normal delivery inspite of Patient and family wanting C-Section and performs it to best of her ability. You can reach out to her at any hour for complicated matters. Also hospital & Delivery charges I found very reasonable.\n\nWe had taken the deluxe room which was clean and neat. Rooms was cleaned thrice a day. AC working properly. Washrooms was clean\n\nWould surely recommend Dr. Pradnya & Aditya Care Maternity Home to each and everyone.",

I had visited Dr. Pradnya ma'am for my pregnancy check up. She made my pregnancy journey happy,  smooth and healthy.  Only because of her treatment, I defeated covid-19 when I was just 3 months pregnant without any complications. I had a healthy pregnancy but at the end I had to go for emergency C-section delivery but the way she handled everything was just amazing. She and her staffs have taken very good care of me and my baby during our hospital stay. A big thanks to Dr. Pradnya ma'am for everything. I would recommend everyone to visit her.",

I had a surgery and was admitted for a day. The anaesthetist and OT staff made me very comfortable throughout the procedure. The staff are really friendly and understanding. You are treated equally and the waiting is first come, first basis with no bias except if their's an emergency. Even though it's a small unit, it's very commendable in what they do best for all the patients. I recommend Dr. Pradnya to everyone who is seeking issues in gynecology and obstetrics.",

But she explained everything in detailed and gave us a confidence every time. You can always find a big smile on her face on every visit and her friendliness with every patient relieves stress of everyone. Hospital staff is also very good.

I had very less confidence over my body regarding efficiency to grow a life inside me...but it all vanished away with her one smile and courageous words that literally gave me breath. She's an outstanding doctor no doubt but more than that fact which I've never seen is she is like a mother sister friend everything u want to see in her she'll be that. Whatever is the situation just by her positive approach towards the same will lighten up anybody's mind from dark clouds it's a big talent of her dt I've seen only and only in her among all doctors I've met until date . such a consistent personality with down to earth behaviour is all her colour.. and she made my pregnancy colourful with the same. It's a true blessing to spend my pre and pregnancy journey with this amazing one man army WOMAN\u2764\ufe0f she's my blessing as equal as I've got my baby ...yes somewhere it's her efforts more than anyone else that I've gone through everything so smoothly. Doctors are called to be god's angels therefore I have met one.. and that's her \ud83e\udd70",

Very professional and approachable.\n\nDelivery was at Aditya Care Maternity Home, Bhandup West. This place has the best team of staff. No patient is ever alone for a moment in the labour room. Extremely courteous, helpful staff and five star treatment for their patients. You don't have to run to any other place for scans or blood test. Everything is available and at reasonable cost.\n\nDr. Pradnya is an expert when it comes to handling complicated issues as my wife had an previous abortion case and this time it was a successful normal delivery. She will go out of her way to ensure that all matters are tactfully handled proactively. Making no room for errors or delay in identifying issues. Have never seen a Doctor who forces for normal delivery inspite of Patient and family wanting C-Section and performs it to best of her ability. You can reach out to her at any hour for complicated matters. Also hospital & Delivery charges I found very reasonable.\n\nWe had taken the deluxe room which was clean and neat. Rooms was cleaned thrice a day. AC working properly. Washrooms was clean\n\nWould surely recommend Dr. Pradnya & Aditya Care Maternity Home to each and everyone.",

I had visited Dr. Pradnya ma'am for my pregnancy check up. She made my pregnancy journey happy,  smooth and healthy.  Only because of her treatment, I defeated covid-19 when I was just 3 months pregnant without any complications. I had a healthy pregnancy but at the end I had to go for emergency C-section delivery but the way she handled everything was just amazing. She and her staffs have taken very good care of me and my baby during our hospital stay. A big thanks to Dr. Pradnya ma'am for everything. I would recommend everyone to visit her.",

I had a surgery and was admitted for a day. The anaesthetist and OT staff made me very comfortable throughout the procedure. The staff are really friendly and understanding. You are treated equally and the waiting is first come, first basis with no bias except if their's an emergency. Even though it's a small unit, it's very commendable in what they do best for all the patients. I recommend Dr. Pradnya to everyone who is seeking issues in gynecology and obstetrics.",

But she explained everything in detailed and gave us a confidence every time. You can always find a big smile on her face on every visit and her friendliness with every patient relieves stress of everyone. Hospital staff is also very good. During my hospitalisation period, loving and caring treatment was given by entire staff. Thank you doctor and entire hospital staff for making this journey happy. ",

I have also delivered corona positive cases in my hospital following all BMC guidelines... when u were tested positive u were taken by Bmc officials to Cama hospital and u delivered there .. u contacted me after delivery and I did tell u what all precautions to be taken... u becoming corona positive n then u were taken by the BMC was absolutely not in my hands and when u went in labor u were in hospital premises where u were in safe hands only... I did what I could do for u but sometimes something fall short which are not in our hands..",
