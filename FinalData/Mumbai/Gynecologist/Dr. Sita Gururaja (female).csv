One of the best things of Dr. Sita is she will not order any unnecessary tests and always tries for most natural treatment.

I was already 36 when I got pregnant. I was a bit scared that I might have a C-Sec, but never once did the doctor scared us for a C-Sec. In fact, she always encouraged that it's perfectly normal to have a normal delivery at this age.
I had a normal delivery mostly because Dr. Sita was so supportive and never during the course of my labour she insisted on a C-Sec. I will strongly recommend Dr. Sita and Godrej Hospital if you are pregnant and looking for a non-fussy pregnancy.
