My Mom is a diabetic patient and she was having ovarian cyst which was diagnosed few months ago. We visited to Dr. Sanket Pisat and he assured us that he can do the surgery with laproscopic procedure. When he saw the MRI reports he said that there might be chances of open surgery if any complications comes during the laproscopic procedure, as she was already operated in 2014 for uterus removal with open surgery the doctor was trying his level best that this should be done with laproscopic procedure.
The operation was successful and we are so happy that it was done through laproscopic procedure only.
Thanks to Dr. Sanket Pisat my mom is fine now and she is recovering well.
Dr. Sanket is so kind and helpful and he alway encourages his patients thats makes him different from all.

Dr. Sanket Pisat is a excellent doctor and he properly and frankly explain the problem and clarify all the doubts moreover, the doctor answered all my question with calm and composure and the hospital entire staff is good and extra caring during my entire treatment. It just wasn’t the treatment, but the doctor's reassuring words which gave me the strength to pull through my condition.

However, personally I had a great experience and extremely comforting with your hygienic hospital.

 I am grateful I got the confidence that I am in safe hands.

Because it was a complicated cancer surgery he made sure the cancer Surgeon, pathologist doctor, emergency ICU doctor etc were all informed and ready before starting surgery itself.
