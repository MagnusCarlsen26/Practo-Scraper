I was to have a fibroid removal surgery with another top gynac but just two days before my surgery I didn‚Äôt have any confidence as that doctor wasn‚Äôt responding to my queries. 

I visited doctor Anjali for a second opinion and didn‚Äôt tell her I had met with another doctor and was due for surgery in less than 48 hours. I wanted an unbiased opinion from her, and she spoke to me and my husband in such detail about my situation that even a child would understand. She drew diagrams, told me that if I went in for surgery what would it be like and explained every minute detail of the post operative care. I left the clinic hoping that she would have been my gynac. 

I took a chance and called her at 10:30 pm on Monday night and explained the whole situation to her and asked if she would do my surgery and within half an hour at that point in the night she had everything arranged for me and that too for the same surgery date and within 48 hours I was able to  continue with my surgery with a doctor I was more confident with. Throughout the pre and post operative care she was just a message away. Always prompt to respond and always so caring.
