She also explained about the technicalities of the harmonic laproscopy and the short discharge and recovery time. She came across as quite professional, confident, calm amd empathetic. She assured us of an effective treatment. The operation went through successfully and we are quite happy with recovery. I would recommend her given our experience.",

After meeting Dr.Sunayna, I received the proper guidance consultation and most importantly cleared all the my doubts and removed whatever fear and myths I had about Fibroids.

After meeting Dr.Sunayna, I received the proper guidance consultation and most importantly cleared all the my doubts and removed whatever fear and myths I had about Fibroids.
