"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Uterus Removal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I had a consultation and a Uterus Removal surgery - Hysterectomy by Dr. Deepika Asati. 
I was recommended to Dr. Deepika Asati by a few of my friends.
Dr.Deepika is absolutely fantastic, she is extremely professional and knowledgeable, her friendly behaviour is really appreciable!
She explained things thoroughly and put myself and my husband at ease and less worried about the procedures I needed to do. 
I was booked in for surgery swiftly within 2 weeks of my first consultation and was extremely happy with post surgical recovery.

Post surgery consultations went well, Dr. Deepika kept constant communication directly with me and I felt very well looked after also in the post-op recovery at home.

Highly Recommend Dr. Deepika Asati.

For any Gynecology problem don't hesitate to see her. She's very approachable. 

A special thank you to Dr. Deepika!",2023-06-16 13:13:21,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
