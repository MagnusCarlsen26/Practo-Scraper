Just take care of you and your diet.\nI always wanted a normal delivery and at last I got my baby delivered normally.\nIt was such a homely experience in this hospital. \nStaff over here is very co operative. They really motivated me and were near me when I was in labour pain. At last I gave up but the nurses and staff they helped me to go through this journey.\n\nThankyou doctor Harshika for this good time with you.",

Specially her practical approach played a great hand in calming my nerves in various instances. A special note of thanks to the staff at the maternity home who have made my stay at the maternity home extremely comfortable experience.  Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Bavishi and her team I gave birth to a healthy boy. Highly recommend her and her maternity home.",

As this was the first surgery in my life, I was too scared being operated. I reached out to Dr Harshika Bavishi for advice. Dr. made me understand the procedure and the risks involved if we wait any longer. She did another sonography to assess the risks. She immediately contacted her assistant surgeon and anesthetist. I got operated at kolekar hospital in chembur .  Dr. Bavishi is  such a competent surgeon , the surgery went well without any complications. She took extra care in post surgery treatment. I was almost back on my feet just after 3 days of surgery. Her professional attitude as a surgeon and strict yet caring nature as a doctor made me feel really comfortable even for this critical surgery. I would strongly recommend Dr. Harshika Bavishi for any gynaec related issues.",

We try our best to answer most of our patient questions in a detailed fashion. However, given the nature of the practice, at times, the doctor may have a pending emergency/ situation to attend to. Nonetheless, you can be rest assured that the guidance you received, though short, is correct. \n\nAs you may know, answers on Google are generic and based on incomplete knowledge, coming not necessarily from professionals . All people and bodies are different. Hence, what applies to one may not apply to another. We strongly recommend that you consult a professional doctor to understand what is right for your body and not rely on Google articles.\n\nPlanning a pregnancy is a matter of patience and a process. We believe in slow but steady progress with the least necessary medicines and tests needed. However, these right treatments require regular follow-ups. \n\nWe hold the highest standards in patient satisfaction and appreciate your feedback. As this review is anonymous, we are not able to identify the case, consultation and hence the recommended course of action. Kindly do share your details to help us understand the cause of dissatisfaction and hence address it. \n\nAlternatively, we would be happy to address your concerns with another consultation (you may choose to do this online or in person).\n\nWe wish you the very best of health for your planned pregnancy.",

Just take care of you and your diet.\nI always wanted a normal delivery and at last I got my baby delivered normally.\nIt was such a homely experience in this hospital. \nStaff over here is very co operative. They really motivated me and were near me when I was in labour pain. At last I gave up but the nurses and staff they helped me to go through this journey.\n\nThankyou doctor Harshika for this good time with you.",

Specially her practical approach played a great hand in calming my nerves in various instances.

Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Bavishi and her team I gave birth to a healthy boy. Highly recommend her and her maternity home.",

As this was the first surgery in my life, I was too scared being operated. I reached out to Dr Harshika Bavishi for advice. Dr. made me understand the procedure and the risks involved if we wait any longer. She did another sonography to assess the risks. She immediately contacted her assistant surgeon and anesthetist. I got operated at kolekar hospital in chembur .  Dr. Bavishi is  such a competent surgeon , the surgery went well without any complications. She took extra care in post surgery treatment. I was almost back on my feet just after 3 days of surgery. Her professional attitude as a surgeon and strict yet caring nature as a doctor made me feel really comfortable even for this critical surgery. I would strongly recommend Dr. Harshika Bavishi for any gynaec related issues.",

We try our best to answer most of our patient questions in a detailed fashion. However, given the nature of the practice, at times, the doctor may have a pending emergency/ situation to attend to. Nonetheless, you can be rest assured that the guidance you received, though short, is correct. \n\nAs you may know, answers on Google are generic and based on incomplete knowledge, coming not necessarily from professionals . All people and bodies are different. Hence, what applies to one may not apply to another. We strongly recommend that you consult a professional doctor to understand what is right for your body and not rely on Google articles.\n\nPlanning a pregnancy is a matter of patience and a process. We believe in slow but steady progress with the least necessary medicines and tests needed. However, these right treatments require regular follow-ups. \n\nWe hold the highest standards in patient satisfaction and appreciate your feedback. As this review is anonymous, we are not able to identify the case, consultation and hence the recommended course of action. Kindly do share your details to help us understand the cause of dissatisfaction and hence address it. \n\nAlternatively, we would be happy to address your concerns with another consultation (you may choose to do this online or in person).\n\nWe wish you the very best of health for your planned pregnancy.",
