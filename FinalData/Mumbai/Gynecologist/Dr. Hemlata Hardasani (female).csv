My preganancy was normal preganancy only.
But like every mother you have lot of anxiety issues regarding your baby.
She was always soft and warm while talking with us.. which I found very comforting.
As long as  your docter is comforting by nature you are relaxed.
Entire 9th months journey with her was truly amazing.. 
Every doubt was cleared by her.
I had  planned c-section as my baby was due .
Ot was booked at cloud 9 hospital at 3pm on 1st may 2023.
Docter hemalata was exact at time at 3pm and I was shifted to OT.
She had huge smile which I found little comforting as I was stressed like every mother but her smile helped me to relax and her motherly approx was very much comforting very time..
Operation took one hour approx. She really did great job!! People say docters are angel .. for me Dr hemalata was a angel who delivered by baby boy safely. Me and my baby both were delivered safely.
She has so much positivity inside her.. you can feel those vibes.
I would recommend Dr hemalata to everyone
Well experienced!! Senior!! The best!!
