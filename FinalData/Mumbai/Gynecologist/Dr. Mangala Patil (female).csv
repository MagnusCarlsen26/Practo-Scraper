None,None,0,0,Yes,"She is very humble and very nice, experienced. She is very good. Very nicely she listened to my problem and very clearly sorted out my problem, she described the problem very well and also explained. When I was in operation the other doctors who were there were also very good and the staff also very good in the hospital. Overall my Wockhardt Hospitals experience was very good. I have suggested that other people visit to the doctor. Dr. Mangala Patil and Dr. Jinendra jain and Physicians are very good and the hospital also. Both the doctor listens to you in detail, not like listening to 5 minutes and sending the patient out with patients they listened and explained what the problem is and gives the solution. They treat us like family. ",2020-02-03 16:45:09,False,True,Kehekshan Parveen,,,
