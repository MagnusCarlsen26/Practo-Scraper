We understand that childbirth is definitely one of the most momentous and celebrated occasions in a woman‚Äôs life and can often be stressful. 
However, when the patient is 37+ years of age and after having tried for several hours (over 6 hours based on our records) at some point the doctor has to take a call for patients safety. Your husbands consent for the same is on our records. Also note that we've had the 4.1% C-section record over the last 29 years of practice with several thousand safe and sound deliveries. While we regret that you had a poor experience with us, please try and understand that we did what we did in your best interest. We hope you and your healthy baby girl have a wonderful life ahead.",2019-07-15T12:22:17+0000,Kulkarni Hospital
