I found the hospital to be squeaky clean, well-maintained, and hygienic.\n\nHowever, the positives were overshadowed by the numerous issues I encountered during my visit. Despite the Practo wait time guarantee, I ended up waiting for over 60 minutes. When I was finally taken in, the doctor spent about 2-3 minutes listening to my issue before leading me to the examination room. The preparation for the exam involved getting undressed and seating on the examination chair. I found myself sitting in a state of undress and waiting on the examination chair for a whole 30 minutes. This left me feeling extremely uncomfortable, embarrassed and anxious as the doctor attended to other patients.\n\nWhile I did keep on asking for the doctor, I didn't feel comfortable confronting the doctor or staff about the wait when she finally arrived. The doctor finally attended to me and the examination went alright, and I was directed back to the consultation room for further advice. However, upon entering, I found the doctor attending to another patient, which led to another 10-15 minutes of waiting.\n\nEventually, I did receive attention and I was out within 5 minutes. The entire process from consultation to examination to consultation again took about 2 hours and 15 minutes, while the actual time spent with the doctor was just about 15 minutes.\n\nTo top it off, I wasn't provided with any consultation notes initially and had to insist on receiving them. Overall, despite high hopes based on reviews and the clinic's appearance, my experience left much to be desired. \n\nWhile I won\u2019t be visiting again, but I hope the doctor and clinic take into account my experience and ensure that other patients don\u2019t go through the same embarrassing and unpleasant ordeal of waiting in a state of undress on the gynecological chair.",

From the inception to the successful delivery of my child. \n\nWe were accustomed to high end hospital of south Mumbai. Apparantely we conceived during April 2020 when  Fear of Covid was at its peak. I was very sceptical  to go to any hospitals and finally decided to look for a nearby \"Women only\" hospital so that the travel is less and chances of cross contamination is less, after all it was the question of our upcoming child which is more important than our life. Had visited few to check and zero downed to OMA Hospital. Without a second doubt it was the best decision of my life.\n\nOMA hopsital's condition, cleanliness, hygiene and attitude of staff is none less than any top hospitals of Mumbai. During these months several time we had to visit for the usual check ups and not a single time I found a glitch, either in cleanliness, Hygiene, services or breach of any safety check and sops. Each and every staff attitude was very professional without any compromise and with atmost care to the patient.\n\nPost delivery the care given by Nurse to the child and patient is next to a Mother. (Eg. - In wee hour (either its 2 AM or 3 AM) whenever baby cried the nurse came in a fraction of seconds without calling and took care of Baby like mother. This shows the commitment towards their duty and attitude towards the patient and child) \n\nComing to the God of this Temple... Dr. Tanuja Uchil.. without any doubt She is the best Gynecologist you can ever have. I will say she was a boon for us during this pandemic. With a very profound knowledge and experience, She has a very positive persona and treat her patients like her own child. Will give quality time to understand and make patients understand the treatments and macro manage each steps to ensure everything goes smooth. (Affirmative: A Genuine Doctor who gives time to Quality) \n\nIn short : If you are looking for a Gynecologist and women hospital with Top quality,  Top hygiene and cleanliness,  Genuine Care, profound experience and a reasonable price : OMA hospital is the answer.",

The clinic's premises is spotless clean and the staff is quite friendly and welcoming. The path lab facility at Oma is another big plus. You can get your tests done as early as 8 o'clock in the morning. \n\nThe only glitch that I can think of is the long waiting hours. It can be really frustrating at times, so make sure you charge your phone  to 100% before you reach the clinic.\n\nAll said and done, if you have enough time at hand and need to consult a fantastic gynecologist, Dr Tanuja Uchil should be your go-to person. Trust me, she is worth all the wait.",

I found the hospital to be squeaky clean, well-maintained, and hygienic.\n\nHowever, the positives were overshadowed by the numerous issues I encountered during my visit. Despite the Practo wait time guarantee, I ended up waiting for over 60 minutes. When I was finally taken in, the doctor spent about 2-3 minutes listening to my issue before leading me to the examination room. The preparation for the exam involved getting undressed and seating on the examination chair. I found myself sitting in a state of undress and waiting on the examination chair for a whole 30 minutes. This left me feeling extremely uncomfortable, embarrassed and anxious as the doctor attended to other patients.\n\nWhile I did keep on asking for the doctor, I didn't feel comfortable confronting the doctor or staff about the wait when she finally arrived. The doctor finally attended to me and the examination went alright, and I was directed back to the consultation room for further advice. However, upon entering, I found the doctor attending to another patient, which led to another 10-15 minutes of waiting.\n\nEventually, I did receive attention and I was out within 5 minutes. The entire process from consultation to examination to consultation again took about 2 hours and 15 minutes, while the actual time spent with the doctor was just about 15 minutes.\n\nTo top it off, I wasn't provided with any consultation notes initially and had to insist on receiving them. Overall, despite high hopes based on reviews and the clinic's appearance, my experience left much to be desired. \n\nWhile I won\u2019t be visiting again, but I hope the doctor and clinic take into account my experience and ensure that other patients don\u2019t go through the same embarrassing and unpleasant ordeal of waiting in a state of undress on the gynecological chair.",

From the inception to the successful delivery of my child. \n\nWe were accustomed to high end hospital of south Mumbai. Apparantely we conceived during April 2020 when  Fear of Covid was at its peak. I was very sceptical  to go to any hospitals and finally decided to look for a nearby \"Women only\" hospital so that the travel is less and chances of cross contamination is less, after all it was the question of our upcoming child which is more important than our life. Had visited few to check and zero downed to OMA Hospital. Without a second doubt it was the best decision of my life.\n\nOMA hopsital's condition, cleanliness, hygiene and attitude of staff is none less than any top hospitals of Mumbai. During these months several time we had to visit for the usual check ups and not a single time I found a glitch, either in cleanliness, Hygiene, services or breach of any safety check and sops. Each and every staff attitude was very professional without any compromise and with atmost care to the patient.\n\nPost delivery the care given by Nurse to the child and patient is next to a Mother. (Eg. - In wee hour (either its 2 AM or 3 AM) whenever baby cried the nurse came in a fraction of seconds without calling and took care of Baby like mother. This shows the commitment towards their duty and attitude towards the patient and child) \n\nComing to the God of this Temple... Dr. Tanuja Uchil.. without any doubt She is the best Gynecologist you can ever have. I will say she was a boon for us during this pandemic. With a very profound knowledge and experience, She has a very positive persona and treat her patients like her own child. Will give quality time to understand and make patients understand the treatments and macro manage each steps to ensure everything goes smooth. (Affirmative: A Genuine Doctor who gives time to Quality) \n\nIn short : If you are looking for a Gynecologist and women hospital with Top quality,  Top hygiene and cleanliness,  Genuine Care, profound experience and a reasonable price : OMA hospital is the answer.",

I would definitely recommend her to any woman planning her pregnancy. \n\nOma is conveniently located (very close to K Star Mall), and this makes it easily accessible to people residing in Chembur and nearby areas. The clinic's premises is spotless clean and the staff is quite friendly and welcoming. The path lab facility at Oma is another big plus. You can get your tests done as early as 8 o'clock in the morning. \n\nThe only glitch that I can think of is the long waiting hours. It can be really frustrating at times, so make sure you charge your phone  to 100% before you reach the clinic.\n\nAll said and done, if you have enough time at hand and need to consult a fantastic gynecologist, Dr Tanuja Uchil should be your go-to person. Trust me, she is worth all the wait.",

Our doctor Dr. Tanuja Uchil took good care my wife and really tried hard for normal and safe delivery as she had assured us from the beginning. My wife received the best prenatal care including advise on proper diet and exercise and was asked to message daily regarding fetal movements. My wife was very comfortable discussing her issues with the doctor. Although we were initially anxious about normal and safe delivery as my wife was primi, Dr. Tanuja Uchil took good care and answered all our concerns and questions. The hospital has state-of the art facilities. There were also other doctors in attendance during labor to ensure the safety of the mother and child and I was being informed time to time about the progress of labor. The nursing and housekeeping staff here are very efficient and come to our help immediately whenever needed. Overall, I am really impressed with the service we received and deeply grateful to all doctors and staff in this hospital.",

She is an experienced professional and has this  calming and warm presence that makes me comfortable in discussing my issues and asking all sorts of queries. I have been to a few gynecologists before who would just jump to prescribing some medicine and hope for the best it seemed. Dr. Uchil on the other hand, is methodical. She listens to the problem, checks on ultrasound whats going on, recommends some tests if required, and then makes an informed decision regarding the treatment. So I know I m getting the best treatment possible. \nThe hospital is well maintained and conveniently located. Entire building is theirs so its convenient. \nI once saw this other famous gynecologist whose clinic was one the third floor, and the rest of the building housed a number of businesses, the lift was busy all the time and the building was very dirty too. Imagine going for delivery to such a building with everyone starting at you.  Made me run back from the entrance itself. So this part also matters to me. \nWait time is a bit long but the pros of this place outweigh the waiting time so that's okay. Just take a book to read and some snacks/fruits along.",

You still didn\u2019t seem to have comprehended the situation.( or you didn\u2019t want to accept the fact that your pregnancy wasn\u2019t doing well).\nYou gave a panic call next saying that you were bleeding, truth was,  you had forgotten to do the blood test.  You had to be reminded by the staff and junior doctor regarding the same.\nThat\u2019s when you came down to the hospital for a test, you were seen despite the fact that you didn\u2019t have an appointment! In these trying COVID times.\nYour subsequent beta hCG was dropping which suggests an abortion or an unhealthy pregnancy. You were informed about it , you didn\u2019t want to accept it that\u2019s why you went dr hopping. \nNext time try internalising rather than externalising the situation. The problem may not always lie with out, it may be within too.\nPlease appreciate the fact that hospital staff are risking their lives and that of their family to serve you, like you they too could have stayed home. \nYou need to grow up beta.",

Miscarriages happen due to you various reasons including uterine problems, chromosomal abnormalities in the baby, placental problems, infections etc...\nPlease get your facts straight too, the place you visited was a hospital, not a clinic, if you had come as you mentioned there is no chance that you would not be seen either by me or my junior doctor. And if my staff has mentioned that I was busy, that means that I would be with another more critical patient in the operation theatre. Though I have realised that patients hide facts and then want to scream EMERGENCY when they have mismanaged. \nAnyway I hope you to have a safe and healthy pregnancy in the future. All the best and God bless you!",

She's a great listener, supports diagnosis after reviewing medical history, and is genuinely concerned about her patients well-being. She is always positive in her attitude and inspires hopes to patients with her smile which gives me confidence. She approaches the treatment holistically and I am under her treatment for over 1.5 yrs. During this phase I underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy and I was better in no time. I am now looking forward for a positive outcome. The hospital is well equipped with latest technologies and has good hospital hygiene. During your appointment ladies, it is worth waiting for your turn cos she diligently and solely manages USG and consultation. I am very pleased with my choice to have Dr. Tanuja as my primary consultant for Gynaecology & Obstetrics. She is a definite GO for any female looking for genuine treatment and consultation.",

The hospital is also state of art with the latest equipments and said to be the best women\u2019s  hospital in Chembur. One thing also to be appreciated is that they are very particular in terms of cleanliness and use disposable materials even in sonography room\u2026the undersheet and oversheet at the Sonography chair/bed is also disposable thereby making it easy for hygiene conscious people like me rest my mind in terms of cleanliness.\nAs regarding the waiting time, the patients have to wait more as sometimes there are emergencies and also some patients take more time to consult with the doctor. But its worth the wait as when you go in, you too are given time and all your doubts cleared, not rushed out in less than 5 minutes as most doctors do, leaving you unsatisfied.\nWould definetly recommend Dr. Tanuja Uchil\n",

There are 3 more people ahead of me and waiting. When I asked why was an appointment given if they don\u2019t stick to it, she handed me a sheet which stated that only appointment cases are seen but delays are to be expected in times of emergency. \n\nThere was no emergency. I heard one of the boys who work there inform the receptionist that \u2018\u2019Adam has come now\u2019 this was at 6:15pm. \n \nI walked out without a consultation as people who do not respect anyone else\u2019s time do not deserve mine. \n\nI pity the pregnant ladies who were there. I had seen the reviews on timings here but thought these must be one off. Apparently that is a pattern. Won\u2019t visit. Won\u2019t recommend. ",

I had visited Oma earlier this year just for a discussion on how to plan for a pregnancy and to understand my options. Until then I had not started planning. We had a friendly talk and at the end was marked infertile in a sheet of paper by the doctor. She had prescribed some tests to be done before the period for which instructions were not given on when to fast, landed up without fasting. Couldn't do it that month as a result and stopped thinking about it. Being in a travelling job could never plan to make time for the test again.\nHad not started planning yet and checked with friends doing IUI and IVF as I was termed 'infertile'. Within a few months of trying normally I was pregnant and later could not get myself to go there again *** ** ***** ********* *** * ****** ******* * ***** **** ** ********** ",
