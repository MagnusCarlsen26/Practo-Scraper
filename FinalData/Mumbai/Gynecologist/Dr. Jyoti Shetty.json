Never picks up calls of patient or relative. ****** *** *** **** ** *** ***** *** doesn't even bother to call back in most cases. ****** she is only advising the mother **** ****** *** ****** **** **** *** **** ****** * pregnancy is a process that both parents experience!\n2. 2 weeks from expected due date, we realised that she has forgotten the due date completely, when she asks us in a consultation that we have 1 month to go (and later said oh sorry I have been miscalculating)! Was shocking and scary - we started thinking if we should stick with her at all, that too at the last hour!\n3. Extortion: We consulted with her for 7 months. She was aware of all history, which hospital we were planning to go for delivery, what the tariffs are etc. She never once mentioned what her expectation on \"remuneration\" was. 1 day post delivery, I (the father who she barely spoke to!) suddenly had 7 missed calls from her office and the ask was for more payment (almost double of what our insurance plan allowed via hospital bill) to be paid to her separately as a side deal in cash!When we said we weren't interested in settling this because we were not told about this beforehand, she held us for ransom and didn't clear my wife and baby's discharge from the hospital. She called me and said you need to visit my office to discuss this **** **** **** *** *** ***** *** ****** ***** *** **** ** *** ******* ****** ******** I was appalled by the behaviour - she expected me to leave my wife and 2 day old baby in the hospital to go negotiate rates on discharge day! Ultimately, had to escalate the situation to deputy dean of the hospital and finish the discharge. Extremely sour experience, with a somewhat well established doctor - would recommend patients to insist having conversation on fee expectations before getting into a long term consultation **** **** ********* ********",
