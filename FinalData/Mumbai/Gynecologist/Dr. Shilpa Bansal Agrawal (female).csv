She gets the problem with the patient at the first meet itself. To cure or manage any ailment, it needs to be diagnosed correctly first. 
Dr. Shilpa took appropriate details about my medical history and made accurate diagnosis of my endometriosis. Struggling with pain every month, I almost started accepting the pain as my fate because nobody actually believed me. Dr. Shilpa always is concerned with my pain and my issues, answers my questions, worries and supports me morally to recover.
I believe her and looking forward for pain free life ahead.
Thankyou Dr Shilpa.
