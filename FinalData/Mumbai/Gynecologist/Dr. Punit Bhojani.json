He is ********* *************, patient in his approach & patient. But his biggest attribute is 'empathy'. He treats every patient differently. With us too, he ensured we were most comfortable with the pregnancy. We were literally hand-held through every procedure and test, the do\u2019s & don\u2019ts, all this without raising a single panic alarm. Always answers the call in the first ring (Unless he\u2019s attending to some patient or conducting an operation), he won\u2019t ask you to do 100 unnecessary tests and make life stressful. He was so sweet, he ensured we got the best hospital & service at optimum expenses.\nAs we had opted for a C-sec delivery, we were booked for the 24th of April. However, as my wife\u2019s water broke on the 21st itself, we immediately contacted him in the morning around 9.30-10am. He was so calm and guided us with the procedure & other formalities. Within 3 hours, we were blessed with a baby girl. Thanks to Dr. Punit, our pregnancy has been the sweetest & most memorable part of our lives. \nWe genuinely refer Dr. Punit to whoever wishes to make their pregnancy a blissful experience. \n",

He is ********* *************, patient in his approach & patient. But his biggest attribute is 'empathy'. He treats every patient differently. With us too, he ensured we were most comfortable with the pregnancy. We were literally hand-held through every procedure and test, the do\u2019s & don\u2019ts, all this without raising a single panic alarm. Always answers the call in the first ring (Unless he\u2019s attending to some patient or conducting an operation), he won\u2019t ask you to do 100 unnecessary tests and make life stressful. He was so sweet, he ensured we got the best hospital & service at optimum expenses.\nAs we had opted for a C-sec delivery, we were booked for the 24th of April. However, as my wife\u2019s water broke on the 21st itself, we immediately contacted him in the morning around 9.30-10am. He was so calm and guided us with the procedure & other formalities. Within 3 hours, we were blessed with a baby girl. Thanks to Dr. Punit, our pregnancy has been the sweetest & most memorable part of our lives. \nWe genuinely refer Dr. Punit to whoever wishes to make their pregnancy a blissful experience. \n",

While he is candid and transparent, I found that his overall outlook towards treatment and care, be it pre-pregnancy or during pregnancy is so free of stress or any toxic urgency to move things fast, that I felt immensely benefited by it. He is extremely encouraging and being the only direct face to face meetings I had during the pandemic, I felt immensely supported and looked forward to the visits. Very grateful for this, my husband and I :)",
