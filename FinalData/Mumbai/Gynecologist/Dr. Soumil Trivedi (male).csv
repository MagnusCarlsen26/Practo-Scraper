"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Robotic Myomectomy,",0,0,YES,"I cannot thank Dr. Soumil Trivedi & the entire Team of Dr. Trivedi‚Äôs Total Health Care enough for the stupendous surgery they have done for my sister.

She had a large 26 cm fibroid which was scary for us & having consulted many doctors who advised such a large fibroid cannot be done laparoscopically Dr. Soumil evaluated her in great detail and said the only concerning factor was that the fibroid had grown by 9cm in a year but otherwise no matter the size Laparoscopic Removal of the Fibroid is possible. Many doctors also said that sometimes uterus may have to be removed but he ensured us that only fibroid will be removed & not the uterus unless there are cancer changes.

The surgery was performed in their New Hospital which I must say is an exceptional private hospital with modern amenities & very clean with really sweet & cordial staff who go above & beyond to ensure comfort.

The surgery was completed laparoscopically as assured by Dr. Soumil & he had arranged a Frozen Section biopsy which turned out to be non cancerous as he had suggested which was a big relief to all of us.

When he showed & explained us how the entire surgery was carried out we were in shock to see how large the fibroid actually was & how efficiently the surgery was handled by him to ensure minimal bleeding & also how they remove such a large fibroid in a bag in strips to remove laparoscopically.

My sister was very comfortable post surgery despite the surgery lasting 4 hrs plus with minimal pain & was up & about the very next day.

I believe Doctors and then I trusted our Doctor. Thankyou Dr. Soumil, Dr. Priti, Dr. Prakash, All assistant doctors and staff of Dr.Trivedi maternity nursing home during all those 730+ days of struggling time to our happiest day that of birth of our baby on üíì 25 June 2020.
Our Journey with Trivedi Nursing home began with an emergency admission of my wife. This was our first miscarriage and reasons we were just guessing. Dr.Prakash and Dr.Soumil  handled our case. We somehow came out of this sadness hoping for positive things that still can happen. Under Doctors advise after 3 months we started medicine course and done some normal tests for next pregnancy. It was found in test report that chances of pregnancy by normal  intercourse were at border. It was advised by Dr. Priti that better we try pregnancy with IUI and IVF as later the fertility rate will come down that then might have to look for doner. We crossed check with few of my company Doctors about the facts. By this time we started believing Doctors at Trivedi Nursing home. We consulted with Dr. Priti and decided this time to go ahead with IUI with still time we have looking at fertility report. Other Doctors could have directly advise to go for ivf this time as IVF is costly than IUI. Our IUI was successful and pregnancy was positive. But our mystery continued and in 6th week we had to face our 2nd miscarriage. This time it was more difficult time for me and my wife to bear this sorrow. During this time we also thought of many things and full of questions like why this thing happened and this miscarriage exactly during same time of 6th week. Even we thought should we change Doctor - we didn't say or make this feel to doctor :) but we were wrong on this thought of ours. This was a turning point when Dr. Soumil handled our case. He did all investigation with our past records and current and helped us understand medical possibilities that could be with our miscarriage. He spend over 30 minutes to help us understand and upfront we got all answers to above questions that we had. He also said that if we really looking to investigate into why this miscarriage then there are more than 52 test that we need to do and cost involved in it. Even doing all this test there are possibility that we still might not find the reason. Further he suggested that there are only 3 test(of this one was historic based on family which was not in our case)that we must do that can help us during our next pregnancy to avoid miscarriage. We now had confidence in our Doctor that we now started to TRUST and came out positively with new ray of hope future. We had undergone hysteroscopy to look if anything internally triggering miscarriage. But  histroscopy didn't had any reasons that we were looking for - it was all fine.

Now back to Dr.Priti who then decided that we must go for IVF as by now we had spend years time. We had our first ivf in June 2019 but this went unsuccessful. We needed to have our 2nd IVF and was asked by Dr.Priti to wait for a month's time. Thereafter we have family emargency took place in August and September 2019 that we had stressful period. We were advised by Dr.Priti that we wait to pass this stressful period and do ivf during normal situations - stress being important part during IUI/ivf and pregnancy. We took her advise and then went for 2nd ivf in October 2019 - This was successful. During our normal Doctor's visit in 3rd week after pregnancy it was noticed by Dr.Priti that my wife's BP was high and she referred to general physician to be consulted. This was one of critical decision in our success story and BP control medicine started. After pregnancy is positive, now the case is back in hands of Dr. Soumil. 

During 6th week my wife had spotting like in periods and we immediately rushed into Dr. Trivedi's hospital. Thankfully immediate treatment by Dr. Priti saved our miscarriage. Next day morning at 8 am Dr. Prakash on his way back from Canada directly visited hospital to see his patient i.e. us. He could have gone home and come back evening for visit as other doctors have attended the case. This concern of his shows how much he cares and values patients.

Every visit from day one till date we had with Dr. Soumil, it was none less than 30 minutes of time that he has given to us - thorough checkup with explaining situations and development in details till you understand it. This time is spend with all patients that he attends.This is very important as a patient, and family member of patient, that your doctor give you enough time and you start trusting - VALUE.

In pregnancy week of 31st, my wife was admitted for evaluation of risk due to continuously high BP. This was time of Covid19 where Mumbai was highly impacted.  Nursing and service staff at Trivedi's were continuously working in a slot  of 10-15 days and stay there itself, avoiding risk of traveling, thereby taking precautions against covid19. Only emergency cases that are absolutely needed for hospitalization were taken in. We came to know hospital was offered to convert to covid hospital, obviously as source of high income. But Dr. Prakash with all care to his patients and been speciality in maternity denied this offer - This is great, Thankyou Dr. Prakash for this wonderful decision. This makes patients like us still believe that there are Doctors who primarily work for healthcare and not to make more revenue.

Finally an emotional day arrived on 25 June 2020 when we were about to have our baby. We were excited and tensed. Whatever we were going to have whether a baby boy or baby girl, it was going to make us father and mother. We finally got a baby boy on the day which was cherishable day in our life. We really thank whole heartedly üíì again to Dr. Priti, Dr. Soumil, Dr. Prakash, Dr. Aditi, all assistant doctors, sisters and maushis for right consultation, treatment, guidance and serving us in journey for having wonderful healthy baby.

Sharing our success story so that it might be a help for other people.

We have been consulting Dr. Aditi Trivedi who explained us the intricacies of the issues I was having after a thorough sonography and we got operated by Dr. Soumil Trivedi.

I had a large uterus almost the size of 5 months pregnancy due to multiple fibroids & had researched exhaustively about various options & found this Hospital sharing all the latest information & options in all honesty & transparency.

I was very anxious prior to surgery but Dr. Aditi instilled confidence in me reassuring me at every step & the surgery was scratchless. Dr. Soumil showed us the surgery & explained us in detail how technology has evolved now with 3D laparoscopy & literally there was not even 2 drops of bleeding in the entire surgery for such a large uterus which had nearly 10-12 large fibroids & almost total 25-30 fibroids including small ones. The uterus was removed in strips in a bag which adds to the safety which I had read when I had researched prior to the surgery.

The hospital has a lovely ambience & all the administrative & nursing staff are very caring with delicious home food provided to the patient & the relative.

Really pleasant experience & the recovery has been very quick as assured by Dr. Aditi & finely executed by Dr. Soumil. I would also like to mention that Ms Sonali Nikam helped us alot with the mediclaim process and both the doctors are very friendly and approachable.

"Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Hysterectomy (Abdominal/Vaginal),",0,0,YES,"Recently I got operated at Dr. Trivedi‚Äôs Total Health Care for Multiple Fibroids for which I was advised Laparoscopic Hysterectomy.

We have been consulting Dr. Aditi Trivedi who explained us the intricacies of the issues I was having after a thorough sonography and we got operated by Dr. Soumil Trivedi.

I had a large uterus almost the size of 5 months pregnancy due to multiple fibroids & had researched exhaustively about various options & found this Hospital sharing all the latest information & options in all honesty & transparency.

I was very anxious prior to surgery but Dr. Aditi instilled confidence in me reassuring me at every step & the surgery was scratchless. Dr. Soumil showed us the surgery & explained us in detail how technology has evolved now with 3D laparoscopy & literally there was not even 2 drops of bleeding in the entire surgery for such a large uterus which had nearly 10-12 large fibroids & almost total 25-30 fibroids including small ones. The uterus was removed in strips in a bag which adds to the safety which I had read when I had researched prior to the surgery.

The hospital has a lovely ambience & all the administrative & nursing staff are very caring with delicious home food provided to the patient & the relative.

Really pleasant experience & the recovery has been very quick as assured by Dr. Aditi & finely executed by Dr. Soumil. I would also like to mention that Ms Sonali Nikam helped us alot with the mediclaim process and both the doctors are very friendly and approachable.

We had been trying to become parents since long & had consulted many hospitals & doctors regarding the same, but, we always got disappointed. Then one of our relatives gave us reference of Dr. Trivedi's Team which is in Ghatkopar East. We visited them with lots of positive hopes. I & my wife met Dr. Soumil & Dr. Aditi. After going through my wife's history of pregnancy they prescribed her some routine tests & medications.  Dr. Soumil explained us all the parameters in detail. This helped us a lot to understand the entire process, as my wife has history of High-Risk Pregnancy. 

We started consulting with Dr. Soumil. Almost after a year my wife conceived Naturally. Our happiness had no bounds. During her 1st Trimester she was not in Mumbai, she was at her mother's place in Ahmedabad & was not allowed to travel. So, she consulted in a hospital there. Dr. Soumil gave her full support & was always available on call for her. Right from speaking to doctors, regarding any test to be done, explaining in detail results & consequences of the reports (without hiding anything), etc.etc.. This really meant a lot to us. In her 2nd Trimester after doctor's consultation & permission she was allowed to travel & shifted to Mumbai. Then in her entire pregnancy period Dr. Soumil & Dr. Aditi as well as their entire staff took utmost care of her. They were 24*7available for any assistance. Dr. Aditi was always just a call away. 

The Drs. at Dr. Trivedi's Total Women Health Care Centre are highly professionals, knowledgeable & answer all our doubts so patiently & politely. The entire staff at clinic & hospital right from nurses, maushis & specially Ms. Hemal are so friendly, co-operative & supportive. They make us feel as if we are @ Home.  Ms. Hemal was just a call away for any assistance if we were unable to contact doctors. 

This hospital has Best doctors, good trained staff, nurses & receptionists. They take care of all necessary precautions & hygiene in clinic & hospital. The food served to patients & their relatives is absolutely superb (Ekdum Ghar Ka Khana). They don‚Äôt have a 5star or 7star look like hospital or ambience & that‚Äôs not at all important. Important & BEST thing is that they have all major facilities for patients available in their hospital & clinic. Everything available under One Roof (sonography, blood test, other screenings, all major & latest equipment‚Äôs & technology, etc). This becomes very convenient for pregnant ladies & other patients. 

Any gynaecological treatment & consultation is Highly Recommendable at Dr. Trivedi's Total Women Health Care Centre, as because of them only today we are proud parents of a cute baby boy Hitansh {our Ansh}, who is now 9+ months old.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Extremely happy with the services provided by Dr. Soumil Trivedi & his Team.

My wife was having heavy bleeding for which had undergone multiple treatments but not getting solved.

Dr. Soumil evaluated & diagnosed Adenomyosis which is thickening of the wall of the Uterus & explained that it usually responds poorly to medicines.

Unlike many other doctors he does not rush through the appointments and gives you adequate time answering every query that a patient may have.

He suggested removal of the Uterus but since my wife has had 2 cesar delivery also explained that urine bag is sometimes stuck to uterus and that is the only complexity he is anticipating in the surgery which is otherwise very routine.

He also has done similar surgery for relative of mine with 3 cesar with Laparoscopy. So we had the trust factor in him & went ahead for the surgery as suggested.

The surgery went off as planned & my family doctor was also allowed in the OT to watch the surgery in 3D & recovery was very quick as if nothing has happened. He also showed us the entire surgery later explaining how the entire procedure was carried out.

Kudos to Dr. Trivedi‚Äôs Total Health Care & Team especially Dr. Soumil Trivedi for excellent services including administration, food, billing & staff for the cordial care.

We were convinced at every step because no one has explained us so patiently with so much accurate details and advised to go ahead with 3D Laparoscopic Hysterectomy with Removal of both tubes.

The pre surgery process, coordination of the administrative staff was excellent and the surgery went off very well. As explained by Dr. Soumil my wife was up & about just 4-6 hrs post surgery & was discharged the very next day with almost no pain or discomfort. He only kept saying one thing. Please don‚Äôt take too much rest after surgery as otherwise it defeats the purpose of these advanced technologies & listening to him my wife was active almost from day 3 post surgery.

He went out of his way to explain us the entire surgical procedure in details explaining how everything was stuck due to previous surgeries. We were awestruck by his experience & expertise to handle such a complicated case with so much confidence & ease.

I have delivered a baby girl before 10 days and this happiness we got because of Dr Soumil and Dr Aditi. We had visited Dr Soumil after trying to conceive for six months. Before we start any treatment, I naturally got pregnant in the same month. Dr Soumil's counselling was a major factor behind it. Throughout my pregnancy, I have experienced great consultations and all time support. My pregnancy symptoms were quite high in last trimester but it was managed because of Dr Soumil and Dr Aditi's treatments. My baby decided to come early almost by a month for which I was very worried before surgery. But they managed it so well that everything turned out to be smooth and happy. When I heard my baby's first cry, I was relieved and I am very thankful to Dr Soumil and Dr Aditi for that moment. I never imagined a surgery also can be completely stress free which was because of Dr Soumil's nature. One more important thing is, you are never asked to spend for unnecessary reports or scans.
