My Husband & I took an instant liking towards her because of the way she guided us.\n\nTo start with, she didn\u2019t judge us for planning a baby at an age of 35, instead she showed us a proper path to plan & have a healthy conception & pregnancy journey. \n\nShe is highly professional yet very compassionate towards her patients. She has always been available for us and our queries at all times throughout the 9 months & even till date. No matter how many times we wanted clarity or understanding of anything, she very patiently explained us whatever we wanted to know or understand.\n\nI told her at our first meeting that I would like to deliver normally & she supported my decision & motivated me to work towards having a normal delivery. Even at the time of delivery, had it not been for her sheer perseverance & motivation & the extremely helpful staff at Cloudnine Malad, I would not have been able to deliver normally.\n\nWe are forever grateful to her for delivering our baby!!!\n\nLove & Gratitude,\u00a0\nShray\u00a0&\u00a0Sohomi",

While booking an online appointment at cloud 9 hospital (malad), I came across the name of Dr. Shweta Shah. I referred to her profile on social media as well as on the cloud 9 website and without giving a thought, booked an appointment with her. When my husband and I visited cloud 9 for her consultation we both immediately connected to her very well. After following her all the instructions and with her help we conceived in no time and decided to continue the consultations with her only. With the time, we realised that --- taking her appointment was the BEST decision I have ever made. Her guidance, *********, super quick response, help, personal connect and positive attitude made our pregnancy journey very smooth. The only reason to get the delivery done at cloud 9 was Dr. Shweta Shah. On this mother's day, I delivered a Baby Boy without any complication and issue. Her positive attitude made it very easy for my husband and I to experience parenthood. My baby is healthy and playing in my arms because of her treatment and knowledge. She is an angel for us. My family and I definitely wish to recommend her name to get any treatment related to any women's reproductive health.",

She has always been available for us and our queries at all times throughout the 9 months & even till date. No matter how many times we wanted clarity or understanding of anything, she very patiently explained us whatever we wanted to know or understand.\n\nI told her at our first meeting that I would like to deliver normally & she supported my decision & motivated me to work towards having a normal delivery. Even at the time of delivery, had it not been for her sheer perseverance & motivation & the extremely helpful staff at Cloudnine Malad, I would not have been able to deliver normally.\n\nWe are forever grateful to her for delivering our baby!!!\n\nLove & Gratitude,\u00a0\nShray\u00a0&\u00a0Sohomi",

While booking an online appointment at cloud 9 hospital (malad), I came across the name of Dr. Shweta Shah. I referred to her profile on social media as well as on the cloud 9 website and without giving a thought, booked an appointment with her. When my husband and I visited cloud 9 for her consultation we both immediately connected to her very well. After following her all the instructions and with her help we conceived in no time and decided to continue the consultations with her only. With the time, we realised that --- taking her appointment was the BEST decision I have ever made. Her guidance, *********, super quick response, help, personal connect and positive attitude made our pregnancy journey very smooth. The only reason to get the delivery done at cloud 9 was Dr. Shweta Shah. On this mother's day, I delivered a Baby Boy without any complication and issue. Her positive attitude made it very easy for my husband and I to experience parenthood. My baby is healthy and playing in my arms because of her treatment and knowledge. She is an angel for us. My family and I definitely wish to recommend her name to get any treatment related to any women's reproductive health.",

She is patient enough to address all your queries and is never in rush. As an amateurs couple expecting our first child we couldn\u2019t have asked for more..\n\nShe is approachable 24*7. And I literally meant it. For minor consultation you can reach out to her on what\u2019s app and she is quick enough to respond to all doubts / queries. No unnecessary visits are required to hospital for minor consultation \n\nShe is 100% apt when it comes to judgement. She won\u2019t advise you to take unnecessary tests, medicines or visits to hospital..\n\nShe has an eye for detail. I can vouch for the same. You won\u2019t ever doubt the advise / consultation provided by her\n\nShe has a great sense of humour and even in difficult time she motivates the patient and keeps the environment light\n\nIn this age, where everyone prefers C-Section, she pushes hard for Normal Delivery. \nYes my wife delivered via Normal Delivery. This wouldn\u2019t have been possible except for Dr. Shewta Shah who didn\u2019t give up till end\n\nShe is doctor cum friend cum philosopher cum well wisher..\n\nWhen your child is delivered via Dr Shewta Shah he/she is bound to have 2 Mothers. The other one in form of Dr Shweta Shah who takes care of the new born like her own mother..",

We got to know about Dr Shweta, since then she has been extremely supportive. I still remember our first meet as she explained deeply about PCOS.\nI appreciate the trust and rapport we\u2019ve built over these past two years.\nThat day and today your constant guidance has helped me throughout my pregnancy journey as well.\nYour reassuring words helped me ease my anxieties.\nWe are extremely truly grateful for the attention you provided and genuine concern you showed for both me and my child.\n\nHope you achieve best in life. Our best wishes are with you\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

Finding the right doctor is the most crucial prerequisite step for any treatment, we were glad that we not just found the right doctor but an excellent one. Dr Shweta would patiently hear all your queries and answer them to your satisfaction. She explains all medical gargons/conditions/prodecures in easy to understand language, her experience and high level of expertise is clearly reflected in her conversations, accurate diagnosis and recommended treatment plan. She is very friendly and reachable, throughout my pregnancy I have reached out to her on numerous occassions mostly via whatsapp messages and have in most cases received a near immediate response. Talking to her feels more like taking to a friend than a doctor which increases the overall comfort level. Dr Shweta successfully delivered my first child few weeks ago and I am now on the road to a speedy recovery. Dr Shweta has been a blessing to me and I am very grateful to her.",

And after consulting her, we realized that it was really worth it. She gives all her patients proper time and listens to every query and problems very patiently. Doesn't recommend anything unnecessary and doesn't force you to get any tests done from any specific lab. Doesn't give any unnecessary medicines especially in pregnancy. Everytime i message her for any query, she is always available and replies within a minute unless she is into surgery. Now that we are moving to another city, we hope, we get a very nice gynaecologist (just like her) there too.\nThanks for everything Dr. Shweta.

The surgery was scarless and I was amazed to see the polyps removed from my uterus without any cuts . \nThe second surgery was removal of uterus as I had severe pain during periods and was diagnosed with adenomyosis . Due to some medical problems I was not fit for general anaesthesia and hence I couldn\u2019t be a candidate for keyhole surgery . She explained me that the entire surgery would be done through a scar , which would be very small and there would be no pain at all after surgery . Trust me , I went through the surgery and my experience was , so wonderful . As she had explained , there was a very small scar and the postoperative pain was minimal . She has wonderful surgical skills and she always assures that her patient remain pain free after the surgery . The recovery phase was so smooth , and I was discharged in 48 hours . \nI would definitely recommend Dr Shweta Shah ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ***** *** at Cloudnine hospitals . Thank you for everything .",

Dr Shweta is incredible with her skills ,she is so approachable so humble and so knowledgeable that she almost predicted every phase of my pregnancy with 100% accuracy, right from the 1st day when I met her for consultation to the very last day when I delivered. The journey would have never been so joyful without her continuous and valuable guidance.In this era where C sections have become quite common and natural deliveries have been squeezed to few, Dr Shweta Shah right from the very 1st day was clear that we would deliver naturally, infact on the labour day when I was struggling with immense pain and was so impatient that I and my hubby went ahead to suggest the doctor to go for C Section not only she advised against it but she also ensured that I was eased from that pain with right meditation and treated in the way which suits my health the best and finally I delivered naturally.Be it late hours or early mornings, she has always been just a text or call away to xtend her valuable guidance during this challenging times. I really appreciate and salute her for the dedication and the professionalism with which she helps her patients.I cannot complete this review about Dr Shweta Shah without mentioning her aura and that smile with which she greets her patients which always provides that added comfort of being in safe hands.Their is so much to write but, I would limit my words by recommending Dr Shweta Shah ** *** ** *** **** ******* * **** **** *** ** ** ***** I would go forward to say that if any doctors wants a masterclass in watching how a doctor should be, I would recommend keep this lady as your role model.",

Dr. Shweta Shah is so good with counselling that my daughter felt at ease before going for a major surgery. At last I would just like to thank her as she is not less then an angle for our family.

But in this pregnancy after being under her care and following her advice on diet and the medications my hemoglobin was maintained without any injections throughout the pregnancy . Dr Shweta made this journey of 9 months so comfortable that  I would always look forward to meet her at each consultation . \nAs I had a ceserian in previous pregnancy , I underwent a ceserian under her . Believe me the surgery went so well that I didn\u2019t have any pain post surgery . There was hardly any blood loss during pregnancy , which was documented by my hemoglobin which she did before and after surgery . *** ** ****** *** **** ************* ** ***** ** ********* ********* .

Even now, when we called her to let her know about my daughter's progress, she didn't asked us to visit her for check up which she could have easily done. instead she first listened to us then asked us a couple of questions and once satisfied with everything, she asked us to continue following her advise with respect to diet and healthy habits. i sincerely thank Dr Shweta for her spot on diagnosis and precise treatment.

But she explains it in very simple ways i would suggest her to my friends and colleagues because she is young and experienced doctor with totally understanding our lifestyles If you are looking for near by gynaecologist please reach her...she is also available on calls if you are facing any issues regarding the health she is just way more forward for her patients and her duties as a Doctor.\n\nThanks a lot.",

She is extremely friendly, approachable and always provides a quick response on WhatsApp to all queries . She is extremely deligent in her work and keeps you aware and informed of the risks surrounding your pregnancy with the right solution and that too in timely manner. She not only monitored my baby movements on daily basis via nst once I entered my 8months pregnancy but also operated me right on time and saved my kids life and provided both of us a new life. She does not call you for unnecessary visits either and is also available on Sundays for folks travelling from far or can't make it on weekdays due to other work commitments. I am indebted to her lifelong for her kind act and presence of mind. You won't regret getting treated by her and her knowledge is just bang on. If I ever try for another pregnancy I will definitely get treated by her again. ",

I was suffering from severe pain during periods and had to take around 8-10 painkillers that time . She told me that removal of the uterus would resolve this problem completely. Her expertise is in getting surgeries done from small incisions . I agreed and went through a laparoscopic hysterectomy. After the surgery when the uterus was shown we were surprised as how she managed to remove the uterus through such keyhole incisions . The period after surgery was painless and I was discharged in 48 hours without any complaints . I didn\u2019t feel as if I have undergone a surgery . I feel she is the best gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon in Mumbai , being young she is very experienced and a perfectionist. Thank u for everything \n",
