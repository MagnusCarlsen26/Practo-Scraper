None,"Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES," To say or how to say a big thanks and a big smile as the journey right from the beginning to the end that is delivering the baby and afterwards too has been so harmonious and so pleasant and so guided by the doctor that we can't say enough. We can't put it into words rather I would say as doctor Siddesh has been a companion and a strong pillar of support, he has guided us, he has explained every minor detail. Whatever questions we asked, might have been silly too but he answered them patiently with a smile the smile on doctor Siddhesh's face is magnetic and I would say we are encouraged to ask questions and have them answered. So it was a very beautiful experience we never felt that we are going to a hospital or to Meet a doctor it was like a friend was waiting for us on the other side and what do I say about Mrs. Doc ? Mrs. Doc is a pillar of support And a big thanks to the staff too. The staff is also very cooperative. Atmosphere at the clinicI puts you at your ease as soon as you enter . To meet the Doctors and talk to them was a stress reliever, it gives you relief even for from your minor ills, and you know minor things which disturb during pregnancy and delivery . It was a joyful journey that's all we can say thanks  to both the doctors to Doc and Mrs. Doc  thank you üôèüèª
