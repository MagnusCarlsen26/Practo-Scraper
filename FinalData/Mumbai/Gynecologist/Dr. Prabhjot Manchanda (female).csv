I am from Hyderabad and had plans to go to hometown for delivery. so, for the first two trimesters we needed a gynic. We ended up with Prabhjot. 

Trust me, At the end of my second trimester i forced my parents to come to Mumbai because i felt more comfortable and safe with Prabhjot.

First of all she is the best doctor i met till now, Why?
1. She is good listener, and explains everything in detail.
2. She treated me like a friend with in 2-3 visits, and she remembered all my records. Every time we felt like we are going to meet a friend.
3. Best thing is, She responded for all my messages and calls with smile. Trust me i had hundreds of silly doubts, but i got answers for all with smile.
4. Available all the time. She use to ask my permission to go on vacation. One can never expect this from a doc.
5.  It was normal delivery!!. no one in my family believed it because i was considered as unfit for normal delivery :).
6. Delivery counselling was very helpful. Being a biology/pharmacy student i could understand lot of it. 

My baby is 4 months old now. He is doing great.

I am very thankful to Prabhjot for her help in my most memorable pregnancy period. I recommend her!!

"Wait time,","Vaginal Infection Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Doctor was unavailable for more than 45 minutes from appointment time. The Staff was not clear and misguided on wait time. We could not meet the doctor at all.

My mother 73 years old could not wait for an seemingly long time due to COVID related risks prevailing in our area.

I would recommend the staff and the doctor maintain some transparency and proactive communication with patients who are waiting for consultation.

If the staff could have informed us yesterday via a phone call to come later as doctor was unavailable it would have saved us a lot of inconvenience.
