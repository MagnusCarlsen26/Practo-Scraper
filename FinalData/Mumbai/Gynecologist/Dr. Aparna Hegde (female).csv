I want to express my gratitude for the care I received from you. I was very impressed by the kindness and professionalism you and your staff showed.  a special thank you to the doctor for being so good at what you do. I will never forget what you did for me.
My name is PRASAD MUNDHE. I traveled from Yeola to visit Dr. Aparna Hegde at Surya Hospital, MUMBAI SANTA CRUZ, for my recurring urine problem I am just 17 years old and I was suffering from urine problems my urine was stopped for 4 months, and for many days I had used urine bag and after some days I had started self catheter and many doctors had told me that we have to do surgery but DR ANITA PATEL referred me to meet Aparna maan and as she told imminently I visited aperna maam and after visiting her She encouraged me to not do surgery and go for physiotherapy instead. This helped me save money and work on my health naturally, via exercises the first day she told me to stop my all tablets and go form only exercises and she told me to do physiotherapy 15 times after that when I started it 3 to 4 times after I started my urine naturally and now I am feeling better than before so I would prefer if someone is having such type of problem or any type of urine related u must visit Aparna maam and ONCE MORE THANK U MAAM FOR YOUR GREAT WORK

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Uterus/ Uterine Prolapse Treatment,Urinary Incontinence Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr Aparna Hegde has saved my life. I have no words to express my gratitude towards her. The lady in whose house I work in has translated this into English as I feel my story needs to be told. I am only 36 years old and I had my second delivery seven years ago. Since then my pelvic organs started dropping through my vagina. I did not do anything about it for the first few years and then because of covid I could not access care. In the last three years, my uterus, bladder and rectum, all prolapsed out of the vagina. After a few months, the prolapse was so big that it could not be pushed back in. Over the next year, ulcers formed on the prolapse and it was obstructing my urethra and I could not empty my bladder. It became unbearable and I was in severe pain and I could not sit or stand. I could not afford treatment and hence I went to Cama Hospital for treatment. There I was admitted under the Gynecology department. They took me into the operation theatre and gave anesthesia but they did not operate as it was a very difficult case. They extubated me and then gave some medicines hoping that the prolapse would reduce and the ulcers would heal. After 20 days, they again took me into the operation theatre.  Again the senior doctor felt that it was too difficult. Because I was under anesthesia for the second time, they had to call a senior highly accomplished doctor to perfom the surgery  And so they called Dr. Aparna Hegde who offers free service as an honorary Professor of  Urogynecology at Cama Hospital every morning. She performed the difficult surgery very well even though the first time she was seeing me was in the operation theatre under anesthesia. I was really relieved post surgery.. However, because my bladder was not emptying properly for many years, post surgery when Dr. Hegde tried to remove the catheter, I could not pee. Dr. Hegde hadn't seen me pre-surgery as she was called to see me for the first time when I was under anesthesia. And hence she could not assess the condition of my bladder and kidneys pre-surgery. And hence it was very difficult for Dr. Hegde to provide optimal treatment for my bladder and kidneys post surgery. She rightly diagnosed that because of long standing retention of urine due to untreated prolapse, my bladder muscle had been damaged and also there was back pressure changes exerted on my kidneys.  However, no one had done any tests on me pre surgery to determine the status of my bladder and kidneys. Even though  it was really difficult, Dr. Hegde provided the right treatment. She kept me on catheter for a month to give rest to the bladder and then she performed biofeedback therapy weekly for relaxation free of charge for me as my pelvic muscles were also not relaxing while peeing. It was a very difficult journey, but now I have completely recovered only because of Dr. Hegde. 
She has come as an angel into my life. She was very kind and spent a lot of time with me to guide me through the difficult process though I could not pay her much money for any of the treatment she provided. She said it was her mission to help me get better because I had suffered so much. She is very soft-hearted and communicates the last details with her patients with patience and holds their hand through difficult treatments. I am so lucky that I met Dr. Hegde as otherwise my life would have been very difficult. And I would have been on lifelong catheter. My kidneys were distended with fluid and now they have also completely recovered due to Dr. Hegde's competence. I will be eternally grateful to her for saving my life. 
In the end, i want to say that all women with prolapse should consult Urogynecologists like Dr. Hegde because they not only assess the prolapse but also co-existing urinary and bowel problems before surgery. And provide treatment for that too. De. Hegde is a great surgeon and doctor and I recommend every patient to consult her for prolapse and bowel and bladder problems.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Urinary Tract Problems,",0,0,YES,"Visited Centre for Urogynecologist & Pelvic Health for frequent urination throughout day and night, blood in urine & pain in pelvic area. For the last 6 months, I have been taking treatment under the supervision of Dr. Aparna Hedge, Urogynecologist                   It’s a long long story, so please bear with me. I’ll try to keep it short but its worth writing.  It was in 2011, when things got started I got UTI twice back to back which got cured with medicines, but after sometime I again experienced the same symptoms- frequent urine every 5-10mins with strong urge and this suffering went on for years. I went to numerous doctors for this issue none of whom who had any idea whatsoever how to help me, they often dismissed my symptoms. I was told it was all in my head. I was anxious, depressed, in a great deal of mental pain, and was out of answers and ready to give up.  Infact, I started believing this is how my body is going to work for the rest of my life. I was striving to live a somewhat ""normal"" life but urgency, frequency made everyday life a challenge.  Also, nocturia interrupted peaceful sleep. I, hardly remember, any night if I had sound sleep in those years. Every night before going to sleep I had to visit washroom for 6-10 times or even more. The symptoms drained me physically, mentally and emotionally. My condition led me to avoid going out with friends..i lost all excitements about life and I also got scared of water. I accepted my life to be this miserable forever. Gradually, i discontinued my studies too.. I was losing hopes.. I was like no way is left out now …. One of the most painful effects of my condition was the loss of trust in my own body and self. All through these years I was not sure if my bladder will ever get back to normalcy. There were days I went to the toilet every 30 minutes. Some days it would be better, and some days it would be much wors. This frustrated me and made me a bit depressed. Whenever I would leave my home, I always had to know the location of the nearest toilet, and who I was traveling with because they needed to be understanding and willing to stop frequently. Over time, I grew tired of this constant mental and emotional pain – often intense enough to make my eyes water. I thought I was having frequent UTI’s the majority of my life. I did everything I could think of to prevent and treat them. It was till 2016 I kept visiting various urologists and then I stopped because no improvement was seen I was just consuming prescribed medicines and all this had huge financial implications on me.   Besides all these, I faced lots of difficulties at my workplace too. I felt discomfort and uneasiness on a daily basis worsning my quality of life even more. I used to think to resign as my condition made my daily commute to office as well sitting in office at long hours challenging and demanding. During March 2018 I got blood in urine and sharp pain in pelvic area..i was  terrified..This is where I started googling  for doctors and I came across this new specialization area Urogynaecologist and its expert Dr. Aparna Hedge. With one visit in her office, I knew I had found someone who understood my pain, who did not brush it off, and who wanted to work to help me through this. She recommended for Cystoscopy and it was then I got finally diagnosed with Interstitial cystitis/ Bladder Pain SyndromeAt first it sounded like a terrifying diagnosis(as I never heard this term before), I was like what it is but then immediately I was happy on knowing that there is something causing these sufferings (I mean it was all real and not in my head) and now something can be done to get out of it..Believe me the most distressing part is when you are suffering and none of your doctors could figure it out and you end up being getting convinced it’s all in your head!!!  She formulated a plan for me which included bladder instillations, physiotheraphy (biofeedback   electrical stimulation), medications , diet/fluid modification and Meditation (a must part of treatment, as mental well-being was also required).Initial 3-4months were frustrating as I was not getting results, but gradually symptoms started appearing on & off..i kept saying myself I had suffered for years I have to put in my all efforts and obviously such chronic conditions do need time to go away and now since it’s been 6 months, I can feel the significant improvements, though not permanent but sort of. Life has become much easier for me now…no more skipping going out with friends.I have started finally feeling relief that I had been searching for almost 6-7 years. To be given your self confidence back, is remarkable, an act of grace and love that is hard to find in the world of healthcare and I got this from Dr.Aparna Hedge. She is friendly with all her patients but at times she is strict too. But that’s too a part of treatment and believe me it’s going to benefit you only, just follow religiously what she says. It will do miracles in your life!!! I am so thankful to her and her team            As I am still under treatment, I don’t know  how long will it take to heal completely but with the time I invested in my treatment at the correct place i hv got back my self confidence and the much needed mental strength to overcome ICI am so thankful to her and her team...  I wish I found you ma'am years ago    ",2018-10-05 08:56:35,False,True,Reetu Meena,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Hegde has been an angel for my mother. My mother suffered from immense pain in the lower region of her abdomen for many many years. We approached so many doctors but nothing worked. One doctor finally told me that they would have do a major surgery that will remove her bladder and create a urinary diversion to the abdomen. She was very depressed hearing this and she was in a bad state for many years. We did not know what to do. We had also exhausted all our financial resources. We met Dr. Hegde when we had given up all hope. Things immediately transformed when we met her. Her warmth and kindness gave hope to my mother for the first time after many years. She gave us a lot of time and held my mother's hand when she cried. Yet she was professional where needed and guided my mother through the entire treatment process with a calm steady hand. Dr. Hegde is the best doctor we have ever met  The only procedure my mother had to undergo was cystoscopy. And all other treatment was non-operative. My mother had a severe problem peeing in addition to the pain. Dr. Hegde explained that it is because her pelvic muscles were contracted in response to the pain.  Dr. Hegde did biofeedback therapy for my mother weekly in which she was taught how to keep her lower muscles relaxed. It was really helpful as the spasm in the muscles was responsible partly for the severe pain. My mother also was put on a strict diet and several medication to rebuild the lining of her bladder.
 My mother is pain-free now and goes for walks in the evening and has regained a good quality of life. We understand that the condition is chronic but we are confident that under the guidance of Dr. Hegde, my mother will have a good life. ",2022-09-10 06:15:04,False,True,Sitadevi Yadav,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Urinary Incontinence (Ui) Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I have taken the help of someone to translate this review into English from Nepali. I do not have words to express my gratitude to Dr. Hegde. She is a genius. I am from Nepal and have been suffering from leaking of urine since many years. A few years ago, another doctor had performed a botched surgery that failed. The leaking or urine increased and had made my life really difficult. I would smell of urine daily. Even if I moved a little, i would leak a lot.  I was very frustrated. 

I visited many senior doctors and it was very difficult to find the right solution. Then someone recommended that I visit Dr. Hegde. She is a pioneer in three dimensional ultrasound of the pelvis and she can do sonography to understand where the previous sling is located and why it is causing problems. I was told that she is the only one who could diagnose what was going wrong and give the right treatment. 

Dr. Hegde was very kind, warm and patient. She questioned me in a very detailed manner and understood the problem thoroughly. She did ultrasound and found out the position of the previous sling. She said that when i coughed, the sling was pulling apart the neck of the bladder increasing leak. She said that a repeat surgery would be needed to remove the previous sling and to take care of the leak. I had major financial issues and she was very considerate about that. She did a test called Urodynamics at very low cost to understand every issue with my bladder. She performed the surgery in the Government Hospital in Mumbai for free where she does charity work every morning. 
The care was really considerate even though it was in a government hospital. I am very lucky that Dr. Hegde entered my life. She is truly a boon to society. She does charity work through her NGO also which is working throughout India. Please look up online and you will be amazed at her dedication to the women and children of India.

Life has become much easier for me now…no more skipping going out with friends.I have started finally feeling relief that I had been searching for almost 6-7 years. To be given your self confidence back, is remarkable, an act of grace and love that is hard to find in the world of healthcare and I got this from Dr.Aparna Hedge. She is friendly with all her patients but at times she is strict too. But that’s too a part of treatment and believe me it’s going to benefit you only, just follow religiously what she says. It will do miracles in your life!!! I am so thankful to her and her team            As I am still under treatment, I don’t know  how long will it take to heal completely but with the time I invested in my treatment at the correct place i hv got back my self confidence and the much needed mental strength to overcome ICI am so thankful to her and her team...  I wish I found you ma'am years ago    ",2018-10-05 08:56:35,False,True,Reetu Meena,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Hegde has been an angel for my mother. My mother suffered from immense pain in the lower region of her abdomen for many many years. We approached so many doctors but nothing worked. One doctor finally told me that they would have do a major surgery that will remove her bladder and create a urinary diversion to the abdomen. She was very depressed hearing this and she was in a bad state for many years. We did not know what to do. We had also exhausted all our financial resources. We met Dr. Hegde when we had given up all hope. Things immediately transformed when we met her. Her warmth and kindness gave hope to my mother for the first time after many years. She gave us a lot of time and held my mother's hand when she cried. Yet she was professional where needed and guided my mother through the entire treatment process with a calm steady hand. Dr. Hegde is the best doctor we have ever met  The only procedure my mother had to undergo was cystoscopy. And all other treatment was non-operative. My mother had a severe problem peeing in addition to the pain. Dr. Hegde explained that it is because her pelvic muscles were contracted in response to the pain.  Dr. Hegde did biofeedback therapy for my mother weekly in which she was taught how to keep her lower muscles relaxed. It was really helpful as the spasm in the muscles was responsible partly for the severe pain. My mother also was put on a strict diet and several medication to rebuild the lining of her bladder.
 My mother is pain-free now and goes for walks in the evening and has regained a good quality of life. We understand that the condition is chronic but we are confident that under the guidance of Dr. Hegde, my mother will have a good life. ",2022-09-10 06:15:04,False,True,Sitadevi Yadav,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Urinary Incontinence (Ui) Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I have taken the help of someone to translate this review into English from Nepali. I do not have words to express my gratitude to Dr. Hegde. She is a genius. I am from Nepal and have been suffering from leaking of urine since many years. A few years ago, another doctor had performed a botched surgery that failed. The leaking or urine increased and had made my life really difficult. I would smell of urine daily. Even if I moved a little, i would leak a lot.  I was very frustrated. 

I visited many senior doctors and it was very difficult to find the right solution. Then someone recommended that I visit Dr. Hegde. She is a pioneer in three dimensional ultrasound of the pelvis and she can do sonography to understand where the previous sling is located and why it is causing problems. I was told that she is the only one who could diagnose what was going wrong and give the right treatment. 

Dr. Hegde was very kind, warm and patient. She questioned me in a very detailed manner and understood the problem thoroughly. She did ultrasound and found out the position of the previous sling. She said that when i coughed, the sling was pulling apart the neck of the bladder increasing leak. She said that a repeat surgery would be needed to remove the previous sling and to take care of the leak. I had major financial issues and she was very considerate about that. She did a test called Urodynamics at very low cost to understand every issue with my bladder. She performed the surgery in the Government Hospital in Mumbai for free where she does charity work every morning. 
The care was really considerate even though it was in a government hospital. I am very lucky that Dr. Hegde entered my life. She is truly a boon to society. She does charity work through her NGO also which is working throughout India. Please look up online and you will be amazed at her dedication to the women and children of India.

None,None,0,0,YES,"This will be a long review but she totally totally deserves it. 

For me Dr Aparna is no less than an angel. I have been suffering from UTI for a very very long long and it was just growing in intensity. I have visited multiple doctors form different fields and admitted in hospitals for multiple times. My issue was even more complicated since I had some kidney issues and had to get a small part of my kidney removed last year. But this UTI problem was different and irritating me to the core. I had almost forgotten how it is to be normal I think for this problem I have been on medicine for years together. I am sure many may relate to me when you keep popping pills and you still not become alright and finally my friend recommend Dr Aparna to me. 

In our very first meeting she shared that what I am thinking as UTI is most likely something to do with a bladder she used some name which I have forgotten ( doesn't matter ) She shared that sadly its true in 50% of the cases for women that they get wrongly diagnosed as UTI and of course get treated wrongly too. Still she did not go with her gut feel and did a cystoscopy and confirmed her hunch. Showed me the image and started the course of treatment. All through out she was extremely sensitive to the fact that I have taken way too much of medicine and have through too much so she answered questions multiple multiple times and reduced my medication to just one pill. 

Think about it how many of us women face uti issues and keep popping the traditional pills or worst feel sorry for ourselves but what if what you are suffering from is not uti at all. What you really really need is a Uro-gynecologist and there is really no better person that Dr Aparna. 

Dr Aparna thank you so much for everything you. I owe my peaceful life to you.

It was diagnosed as a urinary infection and my saga of anitibiotics started.
the problem did not disapear and with every week passing my anxiety increased.. In the process i changed multiple doctors as i did not get correct diagnosis or treatment..I was told that its in my mind or i am not particular with my hygiene but believe my after 6 months of NONSTOP burning  i was trying it all..
i was asking doctors do i have bladder pain syndrome and they all refused.. 
Finally one doctor suggested a cystoscopy and diagnosed me with bladder pain syndrome. However the treatment was soo superficial..  I was adviced cystopen and to eat less spicy and less oily.. The joke is that i never ate spicy or oily. After this I got a bad flare in 1 month and i could not get thru the doctor for 3 days..after 3 days when i met him he said u have to live with this... from a group in india i got dr aparna hegdes number..
the first time i went to meet her i was very anxious cause she was my last ray of hope to get my original life back.. She saw me and understood what i was undergoing. She patiently explained me the whole problem and the treatment.. her approach was to treat my whole body and repair it from the roots..
She was the only doctor amongst the NINE doctors i met who agreed there is an actual problem.. i was adviced 
bladder instillations 
a strict diet 
physiotherapy(biofeedback by maple only done by her)
6 months down the treatment i can say i have got a new way of life which is healthier and not unpredictable healthwise..
SHe is there to guide to me 24 by 7.. 
She was firm with me and at times i was fedup but believe me it was for my good at the end of the day..

Dr Aparna is a genuine practitioner who is concerned about women health in India. She also runs an NGO that helps poor women who can not afford to visit doctors or are hesitant to discuss their problems with a doctor.
Dr Aparna Hegde explained to me  the reason of my problem and told me about the available remedies but my problem had become more serious and I could not linger on further, Dr Hegde performed hysterectomy (hysterectomy done by a gynaecologist n done by a urogynecologist is a different ball game,it is just not removing uterus) She also guided me on how to to have healthy life post hysterectomy.

None,None,0,0,YES,"Hello I am Divya Sachdeva from Naranaul, Haryana. In a very small age i have suffered from an unusual problem that I could not pass urine. I had a very thin flow and retained urine after passing. It was very distressing. For treatment, I have gone to many hospitals and doctors all over Delhi NCR. Different treatments were tried, but none succeeded in the last three years. Before meeting Dr. Aparna Hegde, a doctor in one of the top hospitals in Delhi had done dilation of the urethra 18 times, once every two months but there was no sign of recovery. And that doctor only finally suggested that I consult Dr. Aparna in Gurgaon. When I met her, she thoroughly studied all my reports and performed a very comprehensive test not performed elsewhere. She diagnosed my problem immediately and put me on a treatment plan that has worked wonders. She also performed a new non-surgical therapy on me that helped. I can pass urine now and I am not holding urine in my bladder after passing urine when before i would often hold more than 600 cc. I have been completely cured without undergoing surgery. 

Dr. Aparna is a very good doctor. She has not only treated my physical body but I have also learned how to achieve mental peace with her. I am really fully happy with the treatment. My family is also very happy as my problem was a source of great distress to everyone. Dr. Aparna is very intelligent and quick thinking doctor, she immediately picked up details no one had noticed. She picked the issue up very well. She is also full of kindness. She explained the problem very well to me and my family and we felt relieved for the first time in three years after meeting her. She is like a friend and I am not scared to go to UPHI like I was with other hospitals. Her nurses are also very kind and helpful. The hospital is very nice and the only hospital for this problem I could find. 

She has saved my life because otherwise my kidneys could have failed and repeated dilation could have damaged my urethra. I am very grateful that I found Dr Aparna. ",2015-10-03 07:42:55,False,True,Divya Sachdeva,,,

 Luckily, from a reliable sources, I  heard  about Dr. Aparna Hegde and went to UPHI, Gurgaon for consultation. Dr. Aparna Hegde  started my treatment at UPHI, Gurgaon.  After her treatment, more than 50 % of my problem has been reduced and I am felling better now a days.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"You've been through one doctor after the other, suffered patiently or impatiently, been told its all in your head so much that you have lived a life of doubt, denial and depression. As years go by, you have eventually learnt to go through whatever is on offer with a smile and the occasional tear. All your tests at the path lab look as fine as they could be. But every time you eat even a little, your stomach bloats like a balloon and every time you need to pee, it takes hours as your bladder gives you a few lessons in patience every day for many days stretching out into years. Things feel like they are coming apart, and you manage a half-smile wondering all the while if you need to see a psychiatrist after all, all the while breaking within. 

And then one of your many doctors, mine was a senior, much respected urologist, tells you about Dr Aparna Hegde who is a uro-gynaecologist. 'She may be able to help you because the dilatation has been of no use,' he said to me. 

He was was right. 

My first meeting with the sprightly Dr Hegde was one of her saying a sunny hello, ushering me into her room and then sitting back to give me a a very attentive, patient hearing for a couple of hours punctuated by sniffles and her leaning forward to comfort me. It was a rare moment to hear a doctor say she understood what may be happening. IBS could be a term to explain away un-understood causes and that to be told the problem is all in the head could be very distressing, I remember her saying. She told me how the bowel and bladder were connected as was the distress caused because of both, and while I was experiencing physical discomfort, the source was the mind. For the first time, the term psychosomatic made any sense. She gave me a diagnosis for the problem that took me to her and was confident that given time, therapy and self-effort, things will be fine. It was a condition, not a disease, she said. 'You will get well,' she smiled then. 

Several sittings of therapy and lots of conversation later have brought to the fore the extraordinary qualities of Dr Hegde - her unflagging enthusiasm and empathy, the ability to counsel without being overbearing, her taking the trouble to explain in various ways how the mind and body are a continuum, her promptness to respond and apologize if she is less than 100 per cent on a given day. 

For me, she is more than a doctor - a friend wise and affectionate, observant and attentive... one who has put me on the path to recovery by helping me see what I couldn't earlier. I cannot say I am perfectly well now, nor has she made fantastic promises. There's work to be done. But she does say - and I understand - that we cannot understand and unravel everything; we must learn to accept. Stop focusing on the self, she says, and be 100 per cent in the moment, and what appear like big problems will shrink a bit. She breaks into a smile again and says 'You will get well.'

The operation was a very smooth process at UPHI and recovery after the operation has been on expected lines....in fact my wife now feels as if the operation was never performed, though the problems faced by her before operation are no longer there.
The nursing staff at the center is also quite friendly and attends to every requirement promptly with a smiling gesture always...in fact the entire set up at UPHI is quite homely and doesn't give a stressful feeling at all which one normally carries while visiting a hospital  or nursing place.

She is the most wonderful doctor I have ever met. Not only is she exceptional at her work, but is very warm, humble and patient. She gave me a lot of time to explain my problem and answered all my queries calmly explaining very complex scientific things in simple language. I felt very supported through the whole process. She is very thorough in her work and leaves nothing unattended. And so I developed complete faith in her abilities. She was very considerate even about my financial issues.  I had prolapse of my uterus, bladder and rectum. I met many doctors before her and I was not convinced of the treatment options they were offering me. In the first visit itself, I realised how systematic Dr. Aparna is. She was very detail-oriented and did proper examination to understand where the problem was. She uncovered the fact that i had the problem of leaking of urine on cough also which no other doctor had diagnosed. She said that the prolapse was pressing on the urethra and hence the leaking was not apparent. But pushing back the prolapse showed clearly that i had leaking of urine also. She explained all the options and worked with me to choose the best option for surgery. The surgery process was very smooth. And there was hardly any pain post surgery. She made me feel very comfortable through the whooe stay in the hospital. I am very grateful. After three months, she will be doing biofeedback therapy to strengthen my pelvic muscles. I believe that this therapy is not offered by most doctors and is necessary to ensure proper support to my pelvis. All the best Dr. Hegde for all the work you do for humanity. I saw online that you are the founder of a very nice NGO that works through out India to improve the lives of mothers and children. You are truly a great doctor and surgeon.

As a child, I've had several episodes where I was put on frequent antibiotics. After marriage as well, I had several episodes and a few where I was hospitalized. At about 42 years of age, I realized that I had been dealing with this issue for too long and something about the way I was treated wasn't right. I found Dr Aparna on Practo and right from the first appointment I knew that she truly understood what I was going through. She recommended a cystoscopy which threw up an inflamed bladder situation. So all this while, I thought I had bacterial infections, but in reality it was something else altogether. Dr Hegde prescribed a rigorous treatment for 6 months. To begin with, I was scared and in denial. I felt like I didn't need to go under such treatment and went into hibernation for about a month. in that period, I went through the flares again and visited her again to only fully accept and go through the entire treatment procedure that she was earlier recommending. after about 6 months, I can say that I'm a lot better. I understand my condition a lot more than I did 6 months back. I've also accepted this as a part of my life and have been actively working towards relieving my flares whenever they crop up. Dr Aparna Hegde has been a godsend to me. She is the right measure of empathetic   strict that one could ask for in a doctor. She has been extremely patient with me and all my questions and idiosyncrasies. She has a wealth of experience and has put it to excellent use with all the community service that she does. I admire her in a lot of ways and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who is facing urinary tract or bladder related issues. ",2021-08-19 09:02:30,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

Her quality of life had detoriated so much that she had started avoiding going out because of embarassement and extreme discomfort. I remember consulting a lot of gynaecologists/urologists in Delhi and some of them are the top notch doctors in their respective fields but none of them could give us any direction, any assurance that my mother's incontinence can be treated completely. Infact some of the gynaecologists insisted to just get the uterus removed as it it may be one of the reasons causing incontinence but of course none of them was sure about it. We had almost lost hope.
Then we got to meet Dr Aparna Hegde when somebody mentioned about Urogynaecology.Till then Urogynaecology was something we were unaware of.
I still remember Dr Aparna holding my mother's hand and giving her the assurance that her problem will be completely cured,  and promised that she will get back to normal. It was such a relief for the patient. I believe half the battle is won if the problem is correctly diagonosed  and your doctor gives you an assurance.
Dr Hegde is master in her subject, no doubt about that. She treats her patients so well and she is so compassionate. My mother was very relieved and could trust her fully. She answers all your concerns patiently despite being so busy. She was not in any hurry to perform the surgery. Infact she waited for the perfect sling in order to perform the sling surgery. Post surgery my mother's incontinence problem is completely cured. *** ** *** ** *** **** **************** ** *** ******** More than a doctor, she is a great human being who is passionate about helping women who are suffering from this problem. 
Incontinence is such a common problem among women but still not many people know that it is curable. Infact I guess,ladies start living with this problem and make it a way of their life. All this is because of lack of awareness. People are unaware of this stream called Urogynaecology. Doctors also do not guide you properly, I fail to understand why. For us, it was a struggle to reach Dr Hegde as nobody gave us any direction. And then if at all you get to know about urogynaecology, there are very few Urogyanaecs in the country.
I thank god that we found one and we are very happy to have met Dr Hegde.

I was suffering from UTI (recurrent UTI) burning and painful urination since March 2016. I was treated many times for UTI and once for Uterus infection for more than 19 months. The problem I suffered was frequent urge to urinate with severe pain and burning.

Though UTI being a very common issue but it could be very painful and drastic if suffered again and again. I had almost forgotten how to live normal life.

I have almost visited the best Gynaecologist and Urologist in Delhi. But my problem was remain same and I was then totally frustrated with all these things.

Then, once I googled “best urogynaecologist in Delhi” and have gone through many websites, reviews and all, at last I found Dr. Aparnas’ name in Practo. By reading all the reviews I decided to go to Dr. Aparna. With almost no hope, I went to her, with her pre-requisite lengthy questionnaire.

When I met her, she thoroughly studied all my reports and asked me about my complete history I told her everything. Actually, I visited many doctors and gone through too many tests but Dr. Aparna is the only one who at first visit itself identified my problem and assured me that “I will be alright”.

Although, she diagnosed my problem  but did a cystoscopy to confirm it. Once the test confirmed and after finding the bladder inflammation/ interstitial cystitis she recommended 10 weeks of Bladder Instillation that I have just completed.

Now, I am not fully cured but much better than before. I am still on medication she also advised me for meditation and diet modification. I am following her advice and feeling much better with having the hope to live healthy and normal life soon.

She is very polite, patient and very particular. I would recommend this doctor to people having such problems.

She also treated me for frequent urinary tract infections. Both were long-standing problems. She has helped me so much that I do not need surgery. I now have control over my body and can carry on with activities that caused incontinence earlier. She was friendly and approachable and I could tell her my problems without any hesitation. She explained everything clearly and guided me well, sharing information that no other doctor ever told me earlier. It is as if she has educated me about my body.

Her medicine proved to be magic pill for me and I got my life back…  besides her expertise in her field, she is such a warm and empathetic human.

"Doctor friendliness,","Menstrual Disorders,",0,0,NO,"The respected doctor was in an absolute hurry , as she pointed out that she was working in some hospital. She video called right away without even giving us a bare minute to text her some patient details. 

She asked no questions, gave the bare minimum explanations and advertised some other doctor's services (she probably is friends with) thrice in some six minutes and ended the call. She could be fine with her skills, but she should reconsider taking cases on practo if she can't spare her attention and sensitivity. A huge amount of money for five minutes and no satisfaction. I'd not say it's worth it.

Thank you, Practo  for allowing patients to honestly report their experiences .",2022-08-20 14:05:19,True,False,Verified Patient,"Your description of the video consultation is extremely distressing for me.  As a doctor, I really care about my patients, and I would love to provide the best care to every patient patiently and with warmth. All other reviews on practo testify that I try my best for them. And so, I regret the misunderstanding here. 
But there is a context to every situation and your review does not give that context which I am recounting here: 

-  I video called you at the exact time of the consultation which you describe as being in an absolute hurry. You had not written on the chat that you wanted to send any reports there before I called, so I was unaware of the same. Practo insists that we call on time. It starts sending messages and calling three minutes before the consultation time to say that a patient is waiting. And hence I video called on time. I don’t understand the issue here. 

-	I mentioned that I am in a hospital because I was faced with a medical emergency that day. An elderly patient of mine was in an emergency that was unforeseen, and I had been called down to see her. I was genuinely pressed for time that day. Yet I called at the designated time. And I told you that I was in the hospital dealing with a patient. 

-	Only when we spoke I realized that you had called for a menstrual problem. It is clearly written in my bio that I am a Urogynecologist. I have been exclusively practicing Urogynecology since my fellowship.  I do not practice general gynecology at all. There is no way a doctor can know why a patient has booked an appointment until the call. 

-	You had a longstanding menstrual problem for which you had consulted multiple doctors in Delhi in the past. It was apparent immediately that you needed in-person consultation which I told you clearly. You said you were fine with coming in for an in-person consultation. 

-	I live in Mumbai and my bio on practo clearly mentions that Dr. Karishma Thariani looks after our Delhi center. Since you needed an in-person consultation and you live in Delhi, I recommended you visit Dr. Karishma Thariani as she is an excellent doctor and looks after menstrual problems in addition to being a Urogynecologist. I said clearly that you need an examination before medicines could be given. And you agreed to visit Dr. Thariani. Another reason I recommended Dr. Thariani is that when patients have already paid on practo for a video consultation, we give them free service when they come for a in -person consultation.",2022-08-31T10:18:51+0000,Dr. Aparna Hegde
"Doctor friendliness,Wait time,","Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Aparna Hegde when I had faced almost 6 months of trouble with bladder related problems - burning urination, urgency, retention etc. She asked a thorough history and explained what might be causing the problems, tested me for a UTI and then only recommended me a Cystoscopy. She only recommends the tests that really need to be done. Even though I did not have the regular symptoms, she was able to diagnose it as bladder inflammation and suggested instillations and biofeedback. She uses new / her proprietary treatment to relax the bladder. My treatment is still underway, and even though improvement is slow, I am happy that it has become better than before and the symptoms have become less frequent. She and her assistant both are very approachable. Also, she is very mindful regarding patients having to wait and there is almost no time lost in waiting.",2020-03-16 12:53:12,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

The doctor was always at pains to make us understand the issues, treatment objectives & limitations  and way forward. She gave special post surgery attention during hospitalization.  We got very prompt attention all through and got quick responses to queries in convalescing period.

I had hidden urine leakage which was taken care of during the physiotherapy I went through.  She performed surgery only as a last option after I could not tolerate a pessary for the prolapse.
