In that 10-15 mins slot i did my best job which i do to thousands and thousands patients  with complete satisfaction.

It takes time , multiple sessions, a really long follow up like 3-6 months sometimes a year too and adherence to doctor's advice , , guidance and treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,unsatisfactory first visit. this was our first visit and wanted to be special but while my wife was inside I had to wait outside. She did not pay attention to what my wife was saying. Further additional 100 rs was charged for Covid care ***** ***** ** ** ***********,2020-07-24 14:03:54,False,False,Verified Patient," Dear patients husband,in today's dreadful pandemic  disease  'CORONA' -covid19 for which 100%  treatment nt avaialble in the world,we are serving patients with utmost maximum care and precautions,risking our lives and our kids and our family members lives indirectly.
     For safety point of u ,ur patient,my rest patients in clinic ,to reduce viral load in clinic ,fir less infectivity in clinic ,for less exposure time if anybody is carrier for corona asymtomatic ( Dr can be too asymtomatic carrier after exposure to so many different patients and relatives)
We all drs take only patients inside clinic.relative are requested to wait outside.when patients check up is done,relative is asked to come in and are  explained in short.if any questions from 
relative side are answered .
             Like pre-corona time consultation for pretty good time 15_20 mins was given to ur patient,answered all queries.at the end of her consultation,like oder patients relatives,u were too called in and u both were well counselled and given adequate necessary instructions.
              Ideally anc-pregnant  patient  should not expose herself too much to dr and clinic too.min 5_10 min imp questions and leave clinic immediately.
         But my consultation charge and my consultation time for each patient is same as pre-corona time.
( Not hiked consultation fees at all).

       Extra covid care Rs 100/ amount  taken  for time being during covid pandemic is negligible considering the amount we spend on safety measures we adopt for patients ( like PPE kit usage, sanitisation of clinic with solution sodium hypochlorite 1% daily,fumigation of clinic,sterilium (hand sanitiser) use for patients, temp and pulse  oxymeter use for each and every patient,  multiple hand gloves use in a day for patients .All these things were not used pre-corona time)

         have taken ur proper history in detail  ,examined u thoroughly ,since a month u have been suffering from an infection and sequelae of infection..I diagnosed and given adequate and exact treatment.
explained u in detail too about problem,precautions and prevention..
               Infact  my Prescription is very clear as it is in CAPITAL letters ,with proper dosaging mentioned on it..it was well explained to u in ur counselling schedule in 20_22 mins time span..infact it so simple and clearly written anybody can understand it after seeing.still u allege NT explained to u ..NT bothered..v sad thing .I jus didn't hand over paper to u.

   Lastly I would like to mention that Medicine science can't explain every 'y 's and 'how' s question..Nobody can explain y  and how cancer ,allergies etc happened to  'x ' pt only. can tell high risk factors ,prevention etc.
