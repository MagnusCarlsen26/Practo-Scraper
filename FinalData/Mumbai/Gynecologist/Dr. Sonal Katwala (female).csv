"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnant,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We had been trying for pregnancy for last 1 and had half year. Had met various gynecologists' on the way but it didn’t help.. had almost lost our hope and confidence.
We came to know about Dr. Sonal Katwala thru one of our close friend who had recently became pregnant under her guidance. So we thought of meeting her.
We had great experience as a first timer.
I especially loved how Dr. Sonal really took her time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options.
Knowledgeable, sensitive, informative… I immediately felt at ease – and felt confident in my receiving expert medical care.
Under her guidance I too became pregnant and was one of my happiest day of my life.
Treatment under Dr. Sonal was great during my whole pregnancy period, but one tragedy struck just 15 days before my delivery date. I became Covid positive.
We as a to be parents for the first time got  scared and all negative thoughts surrounded us.
But Dr. Sonal was calm and positive in that situation. She immediately suggested for C-section delivery and we immediately got hospitalized.
She was physically present during whole surgery with other covid specialists doctors. Surgery was successful and we were happy Parents.
We really appreciate her for all the effort taken by her during Covid period.
Dr. Sonal Katwala is incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.
I highly recommend becoming her patient!",2021-07-18 14:01:38,False,True,Akshata,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"2 months after I had had a missed abortion (no heart beat was detected till the 8th week & therefore the pregnancy had to be clinically terminated), when I was scouting for a doctor closer home to save on the travelling I found Dr. Sonal’s profile on Practo with some really positive reviews & booked an appointment with her – This, I now believe was the single most important step I took towards having my baby! Given my earlier failed attempt at having a baby, I was pretty low on confidence & had a very cautious & negative approach towards my prospects at becoming a mother. The detection of a fibroid & chocolate cyst in my pre-pregnancy scans made it only worse. However, Dr. Sonal remained positive & asked us to try naturally for 6 months before we consider other options. As luck would have it we achieved success early & step by step in each appointment, Dr. Sonal managed to increase our confidence with her calm & positive approach. 
The thing I liked most about her is that she has no frills – She gives you the facts as they are, doesn’t panic * **** *** ** ** *********** ****** patiently answers your questions (however silly they may be) & explains her prescriptions – i.e, what purpose each of the medicines she’s prescribing serves – This helps a great deal! Especially since most women begin taking medicines as a routine for the first time in their lives when pregnant & knowing what each medicine is for, helps commit to the routine! – at least it worked wonders for me
Lastly, I was always fixated at having a ‘Normal Delivery’, she asked me to be mentally prepared for both & I did, considering my history & the fact that I was delivering a baby at a ‘not so favourable’ age of 32yrs. But when the time came, she ensured that she does everything in her hand to facilitate a Normal delivery for me & my baby! In the OT too, it was her calm & clear instructions that guided me through the pain & helped me get done with the delivery in under 10mins! Just trust her to do the right thing & you will be through!! That’s what I did!",2020-01-09 05:41:43,False,True,Reshma Vaidya,,,

She never put me on any birth control pills and gave me proper advice as well as some multi vitamins supplements which led to regular periods. After my PCOS treatment we decided to plan a baby under her guidance. She suggested follicular study of ovulation as i had irregular period cycle of sometimes 45days to 60days. In 3rd follicular cycle i conceived. Right from pre pregnancy guidance to through the pregnancy and post that, the experience has been very satisfactory and wonderful. She has been extremely honest, always gave us clear instructions and advice. She was always available a phone call away during any urgent situation. The every 15 days follow ups helped to judge any complications in the pregnancy. Sterling hospital that she suggested was also extremely good in terms of ventilation, cleanliness and service.  I aimed for a normal delivery, however, it looked difficult as even after 24hrs of labour journey i wasn't dilated as needed. I had an emergency C-section but it went extremely smooth.

She encouraged us to ask questions and well, we did have a lot of questions and she was wonderful everytime answering them understanding our mindset as first time parents and providing exceptional care.

We knew our baby was in the right hands when she guided us right through the regular checkups tracking the growth of our baby boy which was explained to us in detail following every test and/or sonography right upto which hospital to chose being the most accommodating one as per our needs and budget. The whole birthing process was explained to us in detail days before the delivery day for us to be comfortable on the “The Day”

We bought our baby boy into the world extremely smoothly with the help of Dr. Sonal guiding us throughout and making a normal delivery possible up until today. She is one of those doctors who not only know what to do but also know how to do it.

She said I need to stop thinking wrong and start thinking good and be happy. Suddenly, I conceived and she has been a great support to me (Mentally, and that's what matters the most from a doctor during your maternity) she always says ""Hojayega"" with a smile to all my queries.

Ladies, I swear by her and I highly recommend her as despite having so many patients daily she never gets frustrated or even does the job for the sake of it. She is the best I could look up to. Looking for a happy and healthy journey in the future with her help.

Her knowledge is vast and she is very supportive in sloving doubts and explaining situations.
Her knowledge on different medicines is also good. Ambience of the clinic and time management of receptionist at the clinic is also good

She is a kind of a doc who will never suggest c section immediately. In my case she tried her level best to deliver baby normally.

She is a doctor who supported me before  , during pregnancy and after delivery.

Me and my husband are planning for a baby as we are the late married couple so we are eager for a baby. For the basic check-up, we went to one of the IVF Centre and my report has detected with uterine fibroid which is very large in size and need to operate as soon as possible.

For the second opinion for the surgery, we went to the Dr. Sonal katawala’s clinic. She has explained us each and every thing very clearly and positively about the tests and results done at IVF. She has advised us to go to the operation because it was necessary for my health also. More importantly, she has psychologically motivated us and removed all negative points about complexity about having a baby at this age. She is so positive and confident, and she always suggests best for her patients so that we finally decided to go for  the operation and for further treatment under her only.

My operation done well, her team in the operation theatre all are well qualified and good in nature. Now I have recovered within 5 days of my operation.
