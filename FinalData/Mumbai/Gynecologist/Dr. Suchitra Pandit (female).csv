,,0,0,NO,"I have never came across with such a “Rude” doctor.. Inspite of being in the clinic she made us waited for 1 &1/2 hr…After all that she was not ready to listen to my problem.. in fact she was blaming me for it.. *** *** * ******* **** ** ******** ** ****** * **** ***** ***** ** **** * ****** ************** ***** ******** ****  ********** She was giving me tips on my personal relations which I had not asked her nor she was knowing me that way.. My husband had 2-3 doughts so he asked her so she got fustrated & straight away said us don’t ask such such questions…For her it might be such/anything but for patients those are doughts.. They come with an anxiety so it is Doctor’s duty to clear their doughts not to shout on them.******* **** **** ** **** ** *** ***************** ******* Will never recommend her to anyone..

,,0,0,NO,"Visited her for my daughter. She was not at all confident for her recommendations. For almost everything that we were seeking consultation for, she asked us to approach other doctors of Surya. It was surprising for us that for a gynecologist problem she is asking us to seek advice from padeatrician. ",2023-01-24 03:28:13,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
