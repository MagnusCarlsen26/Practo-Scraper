If you want to save your hard earned money, plz don't go. **** *** ******* * * **** ****** ** ******* They will give you some package at the start and you will come out paying double **** **** ********\n\nDr doesn't have time to talk to patients, they won't tell you what's going on. No clear talks, nothing.\n\nI got IVF done over there and my experience was bad. We started the procedure. Cost they told us 2 lacs + blood tests + few medicines we need to get from outside + egg freezing charges rs. 15000 for 1 egg for 1 year .(Which was not a small amount for us, still we thought of going to him as he is well known). We started the procedure thinking it would be done in 2.25 - 2.5 lacs something inclusive of everything. We started the procedure and started with the injections and medicines. When they removed my eggs, They told me that my only one egg is properly formed out of 6-7 and that is also of poor quality, and that egg won't be of any use.\nI started loosing hope and getting depressed as I was already not able to convince and again this. I started crying (IVF medicines takes a toll on your physical and mental health).\n\nHe very casually told us to do stimulation again (medicines and full procedure again) - for which we have to pay Rs. 2 lakhs again.\nWe were shocked that how casually he is asking for 2 lakhs rs and we didn't have any option as the IVF is still not complete. We thought it as a part of procedure and paid the amount.\n\nWe did whole procedure again and again when they removed the eggs, again only one egg was formed properly and this time it was of good quality.\n\nNow at the time of insertion, they told us to pay Rs. 15000/- because they had frozen one egg for a month (which was not clearly informed at the beginning, all upar upar se talks, we thought the charges would be for the eggs that are extra and if we keep it with them for one year)\nThey also told us to pay Rs. 15000/- more for one more egg that they had kept when they removed first. I started crying and we said if one egg was formed initially, why didn't they insert it. And then if result is negative, we could have gone for stimulation / full procedure again. They didn't inform us that they have kept the egg, we thought it is discarded, they havent told us that they will keep the egg. Seriously no clear talks, they are in so much hurry because many patients are waiting in queue, ** ********* ******* **** *** ******* * ******* *** ** ***** ******** *** ******** ** ***\n\nAnd the most ri diculous thing is after finishing our full procedure, when they gave us the file, it was mentioned that 2 eggs inserted and both are of AA (good) quality. First procedure paper says, the egg is not of good quality, now they are mentioning both eggs are of good quality.\n** ********* **** **** *** ****** ** * *** *** ******* ******* ** **** *** ***** **** ** **********\n\nWhen our result came negative, we went to meet the doctor, he said we will try for one more time (again we need to pay around 2.5 lakhs + others), and if the result comes negative, then you leave everything as you are not going to have kid in future and enjoy life. (Which doctor says such things?)\n\nAlso, after that he gave us medicine worth rs. 7000 for increasing sperm and for females and he said to come back after 2 days once my periods starts to start the new procedure. When we bought the medicines and checked, it was ayurvedic medicine for sperm and Satavari powder for female. Does ayurvedic medicine give result in 2 days?\n\nWe didn't go for further treatment with him. ** **** *** **************** **** ******* *** * ***** **** *** **** *** ****** ****** * ***** **** **** ******** **** ** ****** ** *** ** *** ***** *****\n\nI would suggest you don't go to this doctor or doctors with big names. if you want to save your money. ****** ** *** ** ** **** ***** ********** ** ***** **** ***** *** * *** **** ***** ****** *** ****** *** **** **** ** **** ****** ******** *** *** * **** ******** **** ***** ********",
