None,None,0,0,YES,"We are eternally grateful to Dr.Firuza Parikh and her excellent team of doctors for the love, care and support we received at FertilTree Jaslok hospital. The entire IVF process was extremely pleasant and a happy experience for me and I am deeply indebted, grateful and thankful to Dr. Firuza who helped me achieve my dream of being a mother. In our first consultation with Dr. Firuza I was convinced that I'm in great hands. Everyone in the IVF department was very supportive and empathetic with me. During the pandemic, Dr.Firuza had taken all the necessary precautions for the safety of her patients. She and her team were always a step ahead and very cautious.This helped me in developing faith and trust in them. I had complete peace of mind and felt safe and protected while my procedure was going on during the pandemic.Dr. Firuza has a magical aura around her which fills your soul with happiness and positivity when you meet her. She is very approachable and a very kind person. I knew I will be a mother one day because a mother (Dr. Firuza) was looking after her daughter (me). That's how I felt throughout my IVF journey. She is a god sent angel for us and I trusted her blindly. She will instinctively know what type of treatment will work best for you. She will not go ahead with Embryo transfer until she is completely satisfied. I salute her  experience, compassion, honesty, dedication and above all her work ethics. In the very first consultation she diagnosed my problem and politely and frankly shared an honest opinion with a detailed treatment plan. I would like to thank the entire set of doctors. Dr. Sujata,Dr. Sangeeta, Dr. Mamta, Dr. Madhvi, Dr. Trupti, Dr.Jyotsna, Dr. Chitra, Dr, Anaita and Dr. Sapna.They are all very professional and experts in their field. They provide clear and concise and detailed  treatment plan/ instructions to us, which has been formulated and decided by Dr. Firuza. There is love ,light and positivity in each and every doctor and staff you come across . All the doctors always welcome you with beautiful smile that lifts you up in spirits. I would like to especially thank Dr.Sangeeta from the bottom of my heart. She is an epitome of goodness. She had been with me throughout my IVF process.  Above all, she is kind hearted and a very  good human being. Thank you Dr.Sangeeta  for always being there on phone and in person. Your kindness, caring and genuine concern made the IVF process easier to handle. The entire IVF Team of doctors provide an angelic aura to the FertilTree department of jaslok hospital.
