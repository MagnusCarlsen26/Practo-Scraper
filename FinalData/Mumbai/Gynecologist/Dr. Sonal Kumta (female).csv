A doctor you can trust and have faith in!

I had seen the doc for my entire period starting from pre-conception checkups to the delivery and Dr sonal handled all test/checkup very well. She won't ask for any test that are not required and don't unnecessarily burden you with checkups and  test. She goes with the normal flow and do as per the need.
