"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dear All,
We have visited Arya Women's Health Hospital for my wife's pregnancy and we have a great experience with the hospital. Entire staff of the hospital is very good. Doctor treated patient very nicely. ****** ****** * ***** ********* ** ***** ****** They always speak politely with their patient. They always inform about the medicines. ***** ********* *** **** ****** ********** They are having a weekly lecture for pregnant women. In that lecture they speak on different topics on pregnancy and they also inform about the different exercises for pregnant women. They are having every equipment with them so you no need to go here and there for test and all. Also like to share that after a birth of my second child they celebrate my daughter's birthday which comes a day after my second child. So, doctor and entire staff is very friendly with their patient and their family too.
Thank you for your support and treatment given to my wife. We are very happy after visiting the clinic.
We are wishing you all the best wishes from our end and all the best for the work.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Vidya Patil was our hero throughout our pregnancy and we thank her from the bottom of our hearts.
Our relationship with her transitioned naturally from that of a patient and doctor (as normally expected) to that of a parent-to-be and mentor. Dr. Vidya kept us informed of our progress all through. With her by our side, we like to think that ours was indeed a normal (caesarean) delivery!
She also served as rock-solid support for us, with her crystal clear inputs and logical advice. Our support system on Arya Womens Hospital  was completed by several other special people, including the wonderful nurses; in particular, Sisters Aarti,Jansi, and Pooja.
Overall, Arya Womens Hospital was a fantastic experience. The fact that all the medical facilities were housed under one roof, right from the pharmacy to the pathology lab, made every consultation smooth. Memorable gestures that will forever be etched in our hearts and minds will be the way she arranged a beautiful decorated cake for us the day after our baby’s birth.
