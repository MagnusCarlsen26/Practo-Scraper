"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"Let's start with the positive aspects. Initially, they had me fill out a comprehensive form covering topics relevant to my concerns, which I found helpful. I found the hospital to be squeaky clean, well-maintained, and hygienic.

However, the positives were overshadowed by the numerous issues I encountered during my visit. Despite the Practo wait time guarantee, I ended up waiting for over 60 minutes. When I was finally taken in, the doctor spent about 2-3 minutes listening to my issue before leading me to the examination room. The preparation for the exam involved getting undressed and seating on the examination chair. I found myself sitting in a state of undress and waiting on the examination chair for a whole 30 minutes. This left me feeling extremely uncomfortable, embarrassed and anxious as the doctor attended to other patients.

While I did keep on asking for the doctor, I didn't feel comfortable confronting the doctor or staff about the wait when she finally arrived. The doctor finally attended to me and the examination went alright, and I was directed back to the consultation room for further advice. However, upon entering, I found the doctor attending to another patient, which led to another 10-15 minutes of waiting.

Eventually, I did receive attention and I was out within 5 minutes. The entire process from consultation to examination to consultation again took about 2 hours and 15 minutes, while the actual time spent with the doctor was just about 15 minutes.

To top it off, I wasn't provided with any consultation notes initially and had to insist on receiving them. Overall, despite high hopes based on reviews and the clinic's appearance, my experience left much to be desired. 

While I won’t be visiting again, but I hope the doctor and clinic take into account my experience and ensure that other patients don’t go through the same embarrassing and unpleasant ordeal of waiting in a state of undress on the gynecological chair.",2024-04-09 09:51:51,False,False,Manali Vengurlekar,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Writing this review after exeperiencing 9 Months of hospitality and services. From the inception to the successful delivery of my child. 

We were accustomed to high end hospital of south Mumbai. Apparantely we conceived during April 2020 when  Fear of Covid was at its peak. I was very sceptical  to go to any hospitals and finally decided to look for a nearby ""Women only"" hospital so that the travel is less and chances of cross contamination is less, after all it was the question of our upcoming child which is more important than our life. Had visited few to check and zero downed to OMA Hospital. Without a second doubt it was the best decision of my life.

OMA hopsital's condition, cleanliness, hygiene and attitude of staff is none less than any top hospitals of Mumbai. During these months several time we had to visit for the usual check ups and not a single time I found a glitch, either in cleanliness, Hygiene, services or breach of any safety check and sops. Each and every staff attitude was very professional without any compromise and with atmost care to the patient.

Post delivery the care given by Nurse to the child and patient is next to a Mother. (Eg. - In wee hour (either its 2 AM or 3 AM) whenever baby cried the nurse came in a fraction of seconds without calling and took care of Baby like mother. This shows the commitment towards their duty and attitude towards the patient and child) 

Coming to the God of this Temple... Dr. Tanuja Uchil.. without any doubt She is the best Gynecologist you can ever have. I will say she was a boon for us during this pandemic. With a very profound knowledge and experience, She has a very positive persona and treat her patients like her own child. Will give quality time to understand and make patients understand the treatments and macro manage each steps to ensure everything goes smooth. (Affirmative: A Genuine Doctor who gives time to Quality) 

In short : If you are looking for a Gynecologist and women hospital with Top quality,  Top hygiene and cleanliness,  Genuine Care, profound experience and a reasonable price : OMA hospital is the answer.",2021-01-18 06:39:04,False,True,Palzom Tshering,Thank you so much!🤗,2021-01-21T08:11:35+0000,Dr. Tanuja Uchil

When you first came to me with a UPT faint positive, we did an ultrasound which did not show a gestational sac. You were asked you do a serum beta hCG test and were asked to repeat it , to know whether it was a delayed conception or the pregnancy was not doing well. 
You were explained the entire situation atleast three times. You still didn’t seem to have comprehended the situation.( or you didn’t want to accept the fact that your pregnancy wasn’t doing well).
You gave a panic call next saying that you were bleeding, truth was,  you had forgotten to do the blood test.  You had to be reminded by the staff and junior doctor regarding the same.
That’s when you came down to the hospital for a test, you were seen despite the fact that you didn’t have an appointment! In these trying COVID times.
Your subsequent beta hCG was dropping which suggests an abortion or an unhealthy pregnancy. You were informed about it , you didn’t want to accept it that’s why you went dr hopping. 
Next time try internalising rather than externalising the situation. The problem may not always lie with out, it may be within too.
Please appreciate the fact that hospital staff are risking their lives and that of their family to serve you, like you they too could have stayed home. 
You need to grow up beta.",2020-08-11T06:27:01+0000,Dr. Tanuja Uchil

As regarding the waiting time, the patients have to wait more as sometimes there are emergencies and also some patients take more time to consult with the doctor.
