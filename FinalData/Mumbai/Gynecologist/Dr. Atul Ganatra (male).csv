None,None,0,0,YES,"I was TTC and  struggling for 2yrs. And After changing 3 doctors, I got lucky and met Dr Ganatra. In my very first meeting with him I got such positive vibes which I can’t even pen down here. He will give you confidence n always show the positive side and that’s what I was looking for after 2 years of TTC cz I feel motherhood is a very sensitive topic and first thing your Doc should do, is to have a connect with you. I have a very rare uterus abnormality which he diagnosed in the frst go and he made it possible for me. I have given birth to my miracle baby 10 months back and I shall always always (I mean it from the bottom of my heart) be grateful to him. 
Also to add here, his clinic’s staff is THE BEST. ",2022-06-07 15:39:20,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
