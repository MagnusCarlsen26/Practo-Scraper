"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Hello all!

You are here reading this.
so either you have been searching for where to go or you have finalised where to stick upon and want to be proud of your decission.
Before I say anything else, I would like to request you to sit back , take a deep breath and relax. You have reached your destination for this particular search.


To start with, We originally belong to Ahmedabad with entire bunch of relatives and pals located there. My husband possessing his where abouts of job here in Mumbai,  we shifted here temporarily in our flat few months back , carrying a 4 months baby in my womb. All we knew here was that we were abdolutely alone.We were in a similar search and being constantly updated with excellency and merits of Dr Saloni Suchak ma'm , we zeroed in on the decission of consulting her for my pregnancy. 
The first time we went to her clinic, I remember sitting in the corridor waiting for the appointment and glanced over a person walking by ; carrying simplicity , charming aura and positiveness wrapped in her personality! When our turn approached we found out that she was the person we were there for.

In the first instance itself, I was mesmerised with the consultation we had. An actual detailed and generous one.
I enjoyed my pregnancy consultation like never before with huge bunch of knowledge and facts gained.
The aura that she carries makes you extremely comfortable and the deepest  knowledge that she carries would make you enjoy your pregnancy even more with you wanting to rely on only and only her for all your problems and queries and situations.

Few consultations went by and we were to shift back to our native place.
On the emerging day when we were to leave, we had our growth Scan and found out few complications. We were about to leave and we just tried making a little request to the hospital staff for wanting to meet Dr Saloni ma'm once before leaving. It was a day off for her consultation routine. To our surprise , on a very little request , she came down specially for meeting us giving so much of value to me as a patient and being there more as a wellwisher and guide.

Pertaining to the complications my pregnancy had , she had to take a tough decission of not allowing to send us back as travelling could worsen the things.We were totally taken aback with the density of the situation and almost were startled.On the very next moment we realised that we actually dint get a doctor but a well wisher , friend , relative and guide in the name of OUR DOCTOR. Amidst the busy streets of Mumbai, I believe we are among those 1 percent who are lucky enough to find a hand to hold on for all queries ranging from pregnancy to other essentials.
She was our one person contact for everything in Mumbai.

Had it been any other professional, i would have delivered by baby right there prematurely. Instead , Saloni mam with her generous expertise *** **** ********* ** *** ******* made me pull 1 long month and deliver baby on the perfect time.

The best part about that one month long duration was that she was by our side each and every second.... and the fact that she was just a second away to communicate ,  made us feel we were perfectly located in our home town.

Also, after the delivery too , she kept that hold on us and did not let us alone for a moment ... I remember texting her for my smallest queries and questions any time of day or night and she taking not more than a minute to reply back be it even mid night.

On delivering , i recollect my child's paediatrician noting down that Saloni mam has done an absolutely great job making me pull this long and that too delivering a baby with a good weight.

We would be going back soon with a smile on our face and a name in our heart forever... Saloni mam! 
My kid says.... Saloni mam is that prayer through which i explored this world full of beautiful colors.. 

** **** * * ***** ** ********* * ****** *** a friendly persona is something we actually search for and Saloni ma'm is answer to all your questions !",2018-10-12 09:25:00,False,True,Priyanka,,,

I always knew I was in the safest hands in this universe.The most important thing is the faith and trust that one has in doctor which  helps in  a stress free pregnancy.

Dr. Saloni is spiritual in nature. She is calm , patient and very peaceful .She is friendly and extremely charming lady. She possesses exceptionally good decision making skills and Is pro -active in nature. She took correct decisions at the right time in my pregnancy.

She will guide  you to have a positive outlook, help you with affirmations , give you courage at time when you start feeling low during pregnancy. She will push you further when you see no hope. She will pray for you .She is bundle of  joy and very high energy . She has an angelic aura around her which hits you all over and fills your soul with happiness and positivity when you meet her .
 
She is like  your best friend who understands what you are going through in the pregnancy. I felt as if I was under the guidance of an elder sister. She is always available like a mother. Always picks up the call within 3 rings and will respond to your query asap. She also responds quickly on whatsapp.In pregnancy, you always need a guide or a mentor who is easily available and accessible at all times . That guide, friend, family member, mentor is Dr. Saloni Suchak.

I feel very  lucky to have found such an amazing doctor. Our bond is such that she helped us in naming our babies too.
My entire family , our little angels  and myself are deeply grateful to Dr.Saloni for taking such excellent care throughout my pregnancy.

I was able to conceive naturally with her guidance within a year and in this process this ensured my body is healthy. Minor but timely correction in my haemoglobin , weight & thyroid really helped. 

During my entire pregnancy journey Dr.Saloni was there for my like a rock. She would answer my calls & messages at any time of the day.

She reached the hospital before me and ensured that I am admitted  as an emergency delivery case as I was heavily bleeding.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Laparoscopy Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,"My experience with Dr Saloni Suchak was so unexpected, particularly having seen other gynaecologists in the city. She is thorough, detailed and patient; and she treats you like a person. 

I knew she would be the one when I had my first appointment with her. We began with a thorough history taking that covered family history, my personal history, the quirks of my body, and my general attitude towards life... all before she ever looked at my reports. I'm someone who favors a naturalistic approach, and she was 100% onboard with aspects of my care being handled without allopathic intervention. She never talked down to me, and she heard me out - all my concerns, all my questions... and we talked till I understood why my best option was surgery. 

Even when the course was set, Dr Saloni kept me looped into every decision. She took the time to explain the results of all my (SO many) tests. An hour before my surgery, we went through the surgical plan together, and she told me exactly what I could expect to feel coming out of the surgery.  Her surgical team was absolutely brilliant - the anaesthesiologist sent me into sleepyland laughing: she had cracked a joke and I was laughing as she placed the mask over my face. :) 

The next thing I remembered was being in my room, post op, after Dr Suchak had removed 1.2kgs of fibroids from my body, plus my uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes. Suchak hospital is geared towards patient health (one of the few in Mumbai) and everyone from the nurses to the canteen staff to the doctors are steeped in a culture of care. My two main nurses (Jayshree and Alia) were clearly born to be nurses. I don't think I could've taken that first walk (or the many that followed), if it hadn't been for these two women. 

Dr Saloni Suchak and I talked everyday in hospital, and she helped me chart the course of how my body would likely progress. I felt like a warrior, walking out of the hospital after a 3 day stay, on my own two feet, after such a massive surgery. 

I'm still waiting for the histo-pathology reports to come back, but should I need further treatment, I know I'm in the right hands with Dr Saloni Suchak. 

Highly, highly recommended. ",2022-08-17 09:26:55,False,True,Shriyansi Sen,,,

When I first visited Dr.Saloni to confirm the pregnancy, all was not looking good on the reports, but Doc assured me to be stress free and gave me medications to sustain the same. She was my ray of hope. N indeed she proved to be my saviour. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I knew I was in safe hands from day 1. 
In 2016, when I visited her for a normal gynac check up, she just touched my tummy, n asked me why did I ever go thru pains of IUIs n IVFs when everything in my uterus was so normal. She said, ""nothing's wrong with you, everything is normal.  Don't stress, if it has to happen it will"". N guess what eventually it did. My faith in her only increased by the day. She is a pure soul. N it only reflects in the way she treats her patients. She was there for me round the clock. I could ping her anytime and she responded immediately. Making me a lil less worried and tensed about what's going to happen next. Cause I knew , doc would never let anything wrong happen to me or my baby.She has magical hands. *** **** ******* * **** **** **** ******* And I am going to keep bothering her throughout my life. Rest assured.
Very accommodating, very comforting, very patient, very kind ,very practical and very assuring. 

So anyone who is looking forward to be treated by Dr.Saloni Suchak, trust me, you are in safe hands!!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy is one of those rides if not driven well then can be a rollercoaster! I knew that I wouldn't start baby planning without proper due diligence and research of a good gynaec and hospital (Yes, I am one of those maniac googlers). Met many doctors who didn't match the long criteria I had in terms of attitude, wavelength, method and approach. And then, I found Dr. Saloni Suchak. Call her my lucky charm or good guide, I conceived within a month of consulting her. 
As my anxious journey began, she guided, kept track, scolded and pacified me like no other doctor would. I think, at some point I forgot that she was/is my gynaec and not a friend! I probably had one of the smoothest and easiest pregnancies which I owe to her and my husband. However, my delivery didn't turn out to be as all of us had anticipated. We all could swear that I would have a vaginal birth and call it a day. But due to some last minute bodily complications, I had to go through C-sec. Had it not been for Dr. Saloni, I don't think I would've recovered or gone through with the surgery with so much ease, especially because it was my first time in a hospital, let alone surgery! 
All in all, my experience with Dr. Saloni was so good that I'd want to go through this again and maybe again only if I know she'll be my doc again. (Haha, not sure she will be happy about this statement!!) I have recommended her to all my wanna be mom- friends. 
PS: I literally miss her post my delivery.

She was on my mind for her friendliness from the time I had visited her with my mom on recommendation of her doctor.
Within 2 appointments she was able to correctly diagnose the cause of my frequent UTI and boils which my previous doctor couldn't post which touchwood I haven't dealt with a UTI. She helped me plan my pregnancy and though I got pregnant earlier then decided throughout my pregnancy journey she has been a very big support, she was just a call away and never got annoyed when asked too many questions. Every appointment she patiently gave enough time to me and answered all my questions cleared all my doubts and guided me so well to a point where I was confident that everything's going to be fine as long as she was the doctor treating me. A high risk pregnancy with gestational diabetes and 2 loops of umblical cord around the neck from the 28th week of pregnancy she was extremely supportive.
I haven't seen or heard of such a proactive doctor who would message me and ask for an update if she didn't hear from me. She encouraged me to even get vaccinated for COVID and i am so thankful to her for that.
Delivering immediately after 37 weeks in the 9th month Dr Saloni ensured that we don't take any risk by stretching the pregnancy and at the same time that we don't deliver pre-maturely which was a brilliant decision from her side and we didn't question it because that's the kind of trust we had on her which she had gained from us.  my baby needed NICU care which was diagnosed by her and the pediatrician Dr Anup and they ensured everything was done at the right time and saved my baby for which I will forever be grateful to her and Dr Anup.
She is also not the kind of doctor who will frequently ask you to visit her unnecessarily.

I was also taking Injections to skip my cycles and allow my body to recover/rest from the monthly cycles and pain.  Dr. Saloni has helped me at every step in the past few years to pvercome all what i was going through( it has been a nighmare which lasted for very long woth the monthly pain, cramps, backaches etc). In Aug 2021 i had visited her as my cycle wasnt stopping at all and again in Septhe same thing so basically i was bleeding all throughtout two months, doctor suggested me to post to do some blood tests and MRI/CTscan.  The report wasnt good my uterus was damaged so was my right ovary. Dr. Saloni explained me the whole process in detail for Hysterectomy and Oophorectomy, pre and post surgery do's and dont's and also gave me an option that i could go along the same way for a few more months with the help of meds, injections etc but i was convinced that since i have to get the surgery done o might as well go for it and i had and have full faith in Dr. Saloni that she will take care of everything for me which she did.  She is like a friend to me than a doctor. She is guiding me even today on how tobtake care, things i should he doing and / or not be doing post surgery.  She supports and am sure will continue to support me with all my ongoing issues like moods swings, heat flashes, any pain etc.  I would recommend anybody who is looking for a Gynae not only in Mumbai but even people from other places shouod visit Dr. Saloni Suchak as the way she handles her patients is outstanding(i had lot of Gynae's i had met but she is by far the best).

        My pregnancy and delivery was so complicated and eventful that if she hadn't guided me throughout, I don’t know if I would have gotten through this. I met her only thrice for my pregnancy-related issues, and after that I came back to my hometown in my first trimester due to COVID. She helped me find a gynaecologist in my hometown through her personal contacts. It was surprising for me because I was not expecting such kind of responsibility from a doctor whom you've only met thrice. After that she kept guiding me throughout my pregnancy without charging anything. She is my saviour, someone who held my hand like an elder sister through my pregnancy-related complications. She helped me find a hospital in Delhi, too, because at the last moment, when docs in my hometown told me that they wouldn't be able to save the baby, I lost all hope; but It was Dr Saloni who guided me through the crisis and told me to keep faith. Because I had no time in my hand—and I couldn’t fly back to Mumbai—she told me to go to Delhi instead of going back to Mumbai to save time.

        I delivered my baby girl during my 29th week in Delhi who had to stay in the NICU for three months.... but we both survived the crisis and are doing fine.

        I can never thank her enough for what she did for me and my baby. She stood by me like a rock throughout my pregnancy and delivery.  Though she was not physically present with me but gave me so much strength emotionally to endure the crisis. She is an incredible person and I am truly blessed that she has touched my life. May she reach great heights in her life. 

        She will always be in my heart.

I reached out to her for my first pregnancy. Had a couple of issues - (gestational diabetes, thyroid).. she handled the journey so beautifully. She made me super comfortable. Just in couple of visits, I knew I was in safe hands. 

My baby was born in April end amidst all the corona scare. She was the most understanding, reachable and supportive doctor, I have ever come across. What I loved was, she reaches out to you even before you do,  to ensure your well-being. Just before the lockdown, she called me and asked to come for a quick check up (35 weeks pregnant) as later it would be difficult. Throughout she proactively checked on me to ensure my well-being and continues to do it even today after my baby is 3 months old. She was always reachable and I was very confident that she is just a call away and incase of anything she will take care of it. 

My delivery was also smooth.. she encouraged me for a normal delivery and because of her I had confidence to go thru it and is blessed with a healthy baby girl. 

On the fifth day of birth, my baby looked quite yellow. It was a Saturday evening. We reached out to the peadiatrician, no response. We were worried and reached out to Dr. Saloni. She asked us to come to her hospital (we had the delivery in another clinic) and she will have peadiatrician on call check her on Sunday. My baby had extremely high bilirubin levels and had to be hospitalised immediately. Thanks to Dr. Saloni, my baby was treated immediately. If my baby was not checked then, it would have got very complicated. It scares me to even think about that. We will forever be grateful to her for that!! Always!!

I visited Dr. Saloni for the first time in July 2019 when me and my husband decided we should plan for a baby.

In a month's time we conceived and my entire 9 months of pregnancy went off really smoothly, all thanks to Dr. Saloni. She is the only Dr I have interacted with who has been available 24/7 and responds literally in a few minutes. She has been like a friend answering each and every query of mine and never made me feel at ease always. 
My delivery happened in June 2020 bang in between Covid-19 and despite the tough times Dr. Saloni continues to serve all her patients 24/7 and with this dedication. I have witnessed her dedication towards her patients first hand and I can only say that very few doctors in today's day practise like her. I had to change my choice of hospital for delivery in the very last minute due to corona and again Dr. Saloni played a very important part in helping me and giving me comfort for such a last minute change.
On the actual day of delivery she was there by my side throughout and kept talking to just like a friend would which made it so much easier to have a normal vaginal delivery.

When we embarked on this journey, we started looking out for a gynaecologist ologist who was a combination of a good doctor, a patient listener and a friend. After doing our research, we zeroed upon Dr. Saloni Suchak who exactly fitted in our framework.

In my case, the pregnancy journey has been very smooth with Dr. Saloni. She did not prescibe any unnecessary medicines or tests and whatever medicines she prescribed, she logically and medically explained their importance to the body. 

Right from the conception of pregnancy to the post delivery care, she has been just stupendous! She is a highly affable doctor who carries that extra human touch, which is of an utmost need by any pregnant lady. She listens to all the doubts with full patience and clarifies them in the best possible way. She is highly accessible even during her holidays, and revert at the earliest which indeed makes her a notch more special doctor! 

During my pregnancy, once, I had extreme fever and mild herpes infection. In both the instances, she diligently handled the situation, made me connect to the physician and skin specialist. Further, she made that extra effort to monitor the progress routinely, and ensured that there was no harm to the foetus. 

Even during the last month of pregnancy, when everything was going smooth, and I was expecting a normal delivery. We were bit taken aback by the fact that baby's head was floating even in 39th week. The situation remained same till 40th week and I crossed my due date. Then a cesarean delivery remained the only plausible option. I was highly petrified of the C section. Once again Dr. Saloni logically convinced me and my family for the same. The cesarean delivery was scheduled and she made me deliver my baby in a perfect healthy condition. 

She delivered her best even during the post operative care and made me feel comfortable in the best possible way.

To summarize, indeed Dr. Saloni Suchak is a doctor who has *** **** **** ******* **** **** ******* ****** *** **** **** a caring and healing touch. I highly recommend her for all the pregnancy related health issues.",2018-12-23 16:58:50,False,True,Neetika,,,

And once we met her, we were immediately convinced that she would be the one to handle our case. Somehow she is the perfect combination of a young and experienced doctor. 

We were made very comfortable and she patiently handled all our questions. Her diagnosis, follow ups and medication was impeccable before delivery.

My wife had to undergo an emergency early term delivery on a holiday. We frantically called her at 4:30 am and she answered the call in one ring and gave us clear instructions.

That's the comfort you seek from a doctor. She ensured that she was available on the same day for the delivery and took a well calculated decision of going for a normal delivery. She was very composed which made us really comfortable.

Being early term our kid needed some more time at the hospital. While technically her job as a gynecologist ends with delivery and follow up, she kept checking with us on the health of our kid and was kind enough to talk to the pediatrician too which really helped.

Well,if I may say, We met her as a doctor and ended up being like friends.

PS: At the hospital, I met another father who said they finally chose Dr. Saloni to handle their high risk case after their initial experience with two other gynecologists didn't go very well! By then I already knew we had made the best decision.

Dr Saloni Suchak from Suchak hospital malad (E) is the answer to your prayers if you’re having difficulty to conceive.
Personally, I had an amazing journey right from conceiving to delivering, thanks to Dr. Saloni. She made sure that everything went smoothly. Having had a 2 miscarriages, I hardly had any hopes to conceive naturally, IVF was the only option I thought I’ll have to opt for but Dr. Saloni went to the root of the problem and treated me and Voilà I was pregnant without any artificial treatments. During pregnancy, Dr Saloni gave me only the required medicines and instructions which highly relieved me mentally. 
Talking about Suchak hospital , it is one of the oldest and the best hospital in suburbs. Comfortable rooms, maximum amenities under the same roof and a courteous staff which looks after you day and night.
