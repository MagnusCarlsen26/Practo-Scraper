I was able to conceive naturally with her guidance within a year and in this process this ensured my body is healthy. Minor but timely correction in my haemoglobin , weight & thyroid really helped.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Laparoscopy Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,"My experience with Dr Saloni Suchak was so unexpected, particularly having seen other gynaecologists in the city. She is thorough, detailed and patient; and she treats you like a person. 

I knew she would be the one when I had my first appointment with her. We began with a thorough history taking that covered family history, my personal history, the quirks of my body, and my general attitude towards life... all before she ever looked at my reports. I'm someone who favors a naturalistic approach, and she was 100% onboard with aspects of my care being handled without allopathic intervention. She never talked down to me, and she heard me out - all my concerns, all my questions... and we talked till I understood why my best option was surgery. 

Even when the course was set, Dr Saloni kept me looped into every decision. She took the time to explain the results of all my (SO many) tests. An hour before my surgery, we went through the surgical plan together, and she told me exactly what I could expect to feel coming out of the surgery.  Her surgical team was absolutely brilliant - the anaesthesiologist sent me into sleepyland laughing: she had cracked a joke and I was laughing as she placed the mask over my face. :) 

The next thing I remembered was being in my room, post op, after Dr Suchak had removed 1.2kgs of fibroids from my body, plus my uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes. Suchak hospital is geared towards patient health (one of the few in Mumbai) and everyone from the nurses to the canteen staff to the doctors are steeped in a culture of care. My two main nurses (Jayshree and Alia) were clearly born to be nurses. I don't think I could've taken that first walk (or the many that followed), if it hadn't been for these two women. 

Dr Saloni Suchak and I talked everyday in hospital, and she helped me chart the course of how my body would likely progress. I felt like a warrior, walking out of the hospital after a 3 day stay, on my own two feet, after such a massive surgery. 

I'm still waiting for the histo-pathology reports to come back, but should I need further treatment, I know I'm in the right hands with Dr Saloni Suchak.

She was on my mind for her friendliness from the time I had visited her with my mom on recommendation of her doctor.
Within 2 appointments she was able to correctly diagnose the cause of my frequent UTI and boils which my previous doctor couldn't post which touchwood I haven't dealt with a UTI. She helped me plan my pregnancy and though I got pregnant earlier then decided throughout my pregnancy journey she has been a very big support, she was just a call away and never got annoyed when asked too many questions. Every appointment she patiently gave enough time to me and answered all my questions cleared all my doubts and guided me so well to a point where I was confident that everything's going to be fine as long as she was the doctor treating me. A high risk pregnancy with gestational diabetes and 2 loops of umblical cord around the neck from the 28th week of pregnancy she was extremely supportive.
I haven't seen or heard of such a proactive doctor who would message me and ask for an update if she didn't hear from me. She encouraged me to even get vaccinated for COVID and i am so thankful to her for that.
Delivering immediately after 37 weeks in the 9th month Dr Saloni ensured that we don't take any risk by stretching the pregnancy and at the same time that we don't deliver pre-maturely which was a brilliant decision from her side and we didn't question it because that's the kind of trust we had on her which she had gained from us.  my baby needed NICU care which was diagnosed by her and the pediatrician Dr Anup and they ensured everything was done at the right time and saved my baby for which I will forever be grateful to her and Dr Anup.
She is also not the kind of doctor who will frequently ask you to visit her unnecessarily.

The report wasnt good my uterus was damaged so was my right ovary. Dr. Saloni explained me the whole process in detail for Hysterectomy and Oophorectomy, pre and post surgery do's and dont's and also gave me an option that i could go along the same way for a few more months with the help of meds, injections etc but i was convinced that since i have to get the surgery done o might as well go for it and i had and have full faith in Dr. Saloni that she will take care of everything for me which she did.  She is like a friend to me than a doctor. She is guiding me even today on how tobtake care, things i should he doing and / or not be doing post surgery.  She supports and am sure will continue to support me with all my ongoing issues like moods swings, heat flashes, any pain etc.  I would recommend anybody who is looking for a Gynae not only in Mumbai but even people from other places shouod visit Dr. Saloni Suchak as the way she handles her patients is outstanding(i had lot of Gynae's i had met but she is by far the best).  Thank you doc once again for every help you have offered.  God bless you in abundance!!

        My pregnancy and delivery was so complicated and eventful that if she hadn't guided me throughout, I don’t know if I would have gotten through this. I met her only thrice for my pregnancy-related issues, and after that I came back to my hometown in my first trimester due to COVID. She helped me find a gynaecologist in my hometown through her personal contacts. It was surprising for me because I was not expecting such kind of responsibility from a doctor whom you've only met thrice. After that she kept guiding me throughout my pregnancy without charging anything. She is my saviour, someone who held my hand like an elder sister through my pregnancy-related complications. She helped me find a hospital in Delhi, too, because at the last moment, when docs in my hometown told me that they wouldn't be able to save the baby, I lost all hope; but It was Dr Saloni who guided me through the crisis and told me to keep faith. Because I had no time in my hand—and I couldn’t fly back to Mumbai—she told me to go to Delhi instead of going back to Mumbai to save time.

        I delivered my baby girl during my 29th week in Delhi who had to stay in the NICU for three months.... but we both survived the crisis and are doing fine.

        I can never thank her enough for what she did for me and my baby. She stood by me like a rock throughout my pregnancy and delivery.  Though she was not physically present with me but gave me so much strength emotionally to endure the crisis. She is an incredible person and I am truly blessed that she has touched my life. May she reach great heights in her life. 

        She will always be in my heart.

I reached out to her for my first pregnancy. Had a couple of issues - (gestational diabetes, thyroid).. she handled the journey so beautifully. She made me super comfortable. Just in couple of visits, I knew I was in safe hands. 

My baby was born in April end amidst all the corona scare. She was the most understanding, reachable and supportive doctor, I have ever come across. What I loved was, she reaches out to you even before you do,  to ensure your well-being. Just before the lockdown, she called me and asked to come for a quick check up (35 weeks pregnant) as later it would be difficult. Throughout she proactively checked on me to ensure my well-being and continues to do it even today after my baby is 3 months old. She was always reachable and I was very confident that she is just a call away and incase of anything she will take care of it. 

My delivery was also smooth.. she encouraged me for a normal delivery and because of her I had confidence to go thru it and is blessed with a healthy baby girl. 

On the fifth day of birth, my baby looked quite yellow. It was a Saturday evening. We reached out to the peadiatrician, no response. We were worried and reached out to Dr. Saloni. She asked us to come to her hospital (we had the delivery in another clinic) and she will have peadiatrician on call check her on Sunday. My baby had extremely high bilirubin levels and had to be hospitalised immediately. Thanks to Dr. Saloni, my baby was treated immediately. If my baby was not checked then, it would have got very complicated. It scares me to even think about that. We will forever be grateful to her for that!! Always!! You hardly come across doctors who care for you so much!

I visited Dr. Saloni for the first time in July 2019 when me and my husband decided we should plan for a baby.

In a month's time we conceived and my entire 9 months of pregnancy went off really smoothly, all thanks to Dr. Saloni. She is the only Dr I have interacted with who has been available 24/7 and responds literally in a few minutes. She has been like a friend answering each and every query of mine and never made me feel at ease always. 
My delivery happened in June 2020 bang in between Covid-19 and despite the tough times Dr. Saloni continues to serve all her patients 24/7 and with this dedication. I have witnessed her dedication towards her patients first hand and I can only say that very few doctors in today's day practise like her. I had to change my choice of hospital for delivery in the very last minute due to corona and again Dr. Saloni played a very important part in helping me and giving me comfort for such a last minute change.
On the actual day of delivery she was there by my side throughout and kept talking to just like a friend would which made it so much easier to have a normal vaginal delivery.

Instead, she approached each concern with a highly analytical mindset, delving into details and providing explanations that not only addressed my fears but also empowered me with understanding.I recall a particular incident where a seemingly minor symptom sparked anxiety. Dr. Suchak not only took the time to thoroughly investigate but also explained the intricacies, soothing my concerns with both her medical expertise and genuine care.

Very co-operative and easy. At the same time, she is very cautious too – it paid well to listen to all her advice, else I would have gotten into deep trouble during my delivery. It seems that she really enjoys her work and money is secondary to her. She didn’t bother to charge me for a procedure (which she had every right to charge for). Even after a month post the delivery, she was so excited to see me. She is very qualified and successfully carried out the delivery of my friend’s baby despite the very complicated nature of the surgery (every other doctor in Mumbai, whom my friend visited, refused to take her case). So, I naturally felt very, very safe with her all throughout. I loved her so much that I decided not to pursue consultation at one other well-qualified hospital near my parents’ house (where my first baby was born) even though my insurance covered the entire expense in the hospital as opposed to part of the expense at Dr. Saloni’s. It’s worth it to mention that my experience at the nursing home of Dr. Nanavati (where I delivered) was really amazing too – they would constantly check on me and used to take care of the baby completely while I got time to recover (no wonder I started walking a day sooner post-delivery). There is a reason why there is such a huge fan following of her and everyone who has consulted her raves about her. She is such a wholesome person. I highly recommend at least initiating consultation with her. In all likelihood, you will not like to consult another doctor thereafter.
