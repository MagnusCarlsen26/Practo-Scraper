However, Anjali Ma'am guided that we should go through conceiving process level by level, first step being to conceive by natural process. She also explained the things with related body functions along with diagrams in great detail.Throughout the pregnancy she was very very supportive, always available on call and whatsapp any time and so many times acted as psychological cum emotional counseller for me. She has always guided for taking simple, nutritious and homemade foods, which has helped a lot during pregnancy.Just before delivery, she did my emotional counselling and unlike others waited for almost 12 hrs for my normal delivery. After that, I delivered a healthy baby boy.She has given all kind of possible support in the most important time of my life and helped me with delivering a healthy baby boy.For me, I would not have got a better doctor and a better person in this beautiful process of motherhood.",

All of us had left the room in tears believing the most negative outcome and that there was nothing better possible. If you feel pressured into a line of treatment that is very hard for you to accept (tight hug), please do ask if there is any risk in deferring it. Please do find the strength and courage to get multiple opinions; I went through 4 before I arrived at one that suited me, each being better than the previous one (dr Bapat was my first). In my experience, several positive details emerged as I proceeded, whereas Dr Bapats consultation was extremely comprehensive on the negative case scenario list (my friends' experience has been the same). She is very well versed with insurance procedures and documentation! If you do not find yourself getting anxiety attacks and crying continuously, you have moved past our stage and can then seek reviews on the technical bit.  All the best in your journey, tight hug, lots of love, luck and remember.. you got this! \ud83d\ude0a",

She could have easily prescribed a few medicines to help me treat the issue temporarily, but she took the effort to make us understand the problem in great detail and suggested us the right approach to deal with this issue, which would be helpful for lifetime and not just temporarily. I've never met a doctor like her before, with a Very holistic approach, and i am very glad to have consulted Dr.Anjali. Highly recommended.",

However, Anjali Ma'am guided that we should go through conceiving process level by level, first step being to conceive by natural process. She also explained the things with related body functions along with diagrams in great detail.Throughout the pregnancy she was very very supportive, always available on call and whatsapp any time and so many times acted as psychological cum emotional counseller for me. She has always guided for taking simple, nutritious and homemade foods, which has helped a lot during pregnancy.Just before delivery, she did my emotional counselling and unlike others waited for almost 12 hrs for my normal delivery. After that, I delivered a healthy baby boy.She has given all kind of possible support in the most important time of my life and helped me with delivering a healthy baby boy.For me, I would not have got a better doctor and a better person in this beautiful process of motherhood.",

All of us had left the room in tears believing the most negative outcome and that there was nothing better possible. If you feel pressured into a line of treatment that is very hard for you to accept (tight hug), please do ask if there is any risk in deferring it. Please do find the strength and courage to get multiple opinions; I went through 4 before I arrived at one that suited me, each being better than the previous one (dr Bapat was my first). In my experience, several positive details emerged as I proceeded, whereas Dr Bapats consultation was extremely comprehensive on the negative case scenario list (my friends' experience has been the same). She is very well versed with insurance procedures and documentation! If you do not find yourself getting anxiety attacks and crying continuously, you have moved past our stage and can then seek reviews on the technical bit.  All the best in your journey, tight hug, lots of love, luck and remember.. you got this! \ud83d\ude0a",

I've never met a doctor like her before, with a Very holistic approach, and i am very glad to have consulted Dr.Anjali. Highly recommended.",

When we visited her we were not aware of the issue, but she recommended the right tests to diagnose it. Not only was she patient enough to hear the issue but also made herself available on whatsapp to answer my queries after the treatment. I was free from UTI after that and till today haven\u2019t faced that trouble yet. Special thanks to your caring approach Dr. Anjali. Definitely recommend!",

We were new to Mumbai and we got know about her from Practo. This being first pregnancy, we were clueless. we were happy as well as well as confused about the future. Our first visit to Dr Bapat was more than satisfactory. Dr.Bapat treated my wife  as being close relative and neatly explained all details regarding the further periods of pregnancy that helped us taking further decisions. She clarified all our doubts and we are great full for her advises. Consulting timings were convenient and adjustable. At some anxiety moments we even contacted her at late nights. \nWe are very much thankful to her and would love to recommend her for the consulation",

I delivered my baby at Khar Hinduja which was also recommended by her for which I am always grateful. I am utmost satisfied with the treatment. Though I had PCOD, I conceived naturally and delivered without a single problem throughout. She is very friendly and takes care of the patient like her family. She would explain each and everything in a very simplified manner which boosts your confidence in the doctor. Our monthly consultations used to go on for hours ensuring we were completely informed of all what's and how's of pregnancy. It was a delightful experience with Dr. Bapat. :)",

It was an emergency situation on a week end and though late in the night, she met us and put me on the right track of medication. The Doctor was very friendly, caring and her diagnosis was spot on and I felt so relieved within 24 hours. I really wish, I could have met her earlier.My anxiety about,my health on the particular issue is totally off. I would very strongly recommend this doctor for all gynecology related  problems. ",

She was very clear in explaining pregnancy is not a disease or any pathological disorder and should be handled with as much positivity as possible and should be thoroughly enjoyed and I did just the same under her able guidance. I have and will always recommend her to anyone who needs to visit a gynaecologist. Completely content with her guidance.",

I was to have a fibroid removal surgery with another top gynac but just two days before my surgery I didn\u2019t have any confidence as that doctor wasn\u2019t responding to my queries. \n\nI visited doctor Anjali for a second opinion and didn\u2019t tell her I had met with another doctor and was due for surgery in less than 48 hours. I wanted an unbiased opinion from her, and she spoke to me and my husband in such detail about my situation that even a child would understand. She drew diagrams, told me that if I went in for surgery what would it be like and explained every minute detail of the post operative care. I left the clinic hoping that she would have been my gynac. \n\nI took a chance and called her at 10:30 pm on Monday night and explained the whole situation to her and asked if she would do my surgery and within half an hour at that point in the night she had everything arranged for me and that too for the same surgery date and within 48 hours I was able to  continue with my surgery with a doctor I was more confident with. Throughout the pre and post operative care she was just a message away. Always prompt to respond and always so caring. \n\nIf you have a good doctor, half your battle is won. Dr Anjali is someone who really cares for her patients and there were multiple times I just felt so good that I made that decision to swap to her. \n\n\nThe whole journey",

Timely tests and accurate medications advised by the doctor were very useful.\n\nOn occassions I had called her in the middle of the night and she was always available to answer my queries and even check for any issues with my health. She was available the entire time during my labour and delivery.\n\nThanks to the positive and comforting attitude along with expert medical advise of Dr. Anjali Bapat, I could go through the 9 months of pregnancy and the delivery with ease.",

Now this time i visited her clinic for my first pregnancy having some issues but now after her treatment started  i m really feel very satisfied as usual. Now I am living at Byculla but still she is my first preference for any of my health issues.\\nHer friendly nature, explanations of health issues, the way she gives comfort level when talking or discussing some problem is really nice. As a doctor she is brilliant no doubt about it but as a human being she is also very nice. I would love to recommend Dr. Anjali. :)",
