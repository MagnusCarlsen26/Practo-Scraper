The approach with which doctor connected and guided us, is really appreciative. She focused on the solution rather than discussing and analyzing the problem statement with us. At all the times she did shared with us the relevant information and kept us informed and along, thereby drawing a perfect balance. With her being at our side we would say this was indeed a normal (cesarean) delivery :-)\n\nShe is truly an expert both professionally and at personal level. \n\nThe easy at which she makes the key decisions reflects her command on the subject. There are no communication barriers when it comes to connecting with her, and this characteristic played such an important role for us and I am sure it would for all such first time expected parent's. Our relationship with her grew naturally from that of a patient and doctor (as normally expected) to that of positive, confident to be mother and strong sturdy medical and emotional support.\n\nThank you once again from us (Swati and Faisal) and of course our chota pataka little angel Ridah. God bless you.",

Management should really look at key points:\n1. During doctor consultation, usual time spent per patient is 20-30mins, then why the appointments are book at every 15mins interval? \n2. Doctor faculty is less and patients are more. The management should work on average visits per day and appoint more doctors.  It's a maternity home, pregnant females and patients with new born to toddlers face a lot of problem in sitting and waiting. \n3. In case of any technical problem, keep visiting patients informed so that they can decide if they can wait further or visit some other day.  Making them wait with no result is even more irritating. \n4. Your ground staff needs a proper training on crisis management as they start putting things on others when any issue is raised.  \n\nDon't know how much this feedback would be considered...  But I think someone has to raise this, so I did. ",

Usually we all feel stressed when we visit doctor for our health issues but the moment you talk to her your stress flies away... Big smile on her face make me feel refreshed, the way she discuss things is just like big thing looks small. She always make me feel comfortable. Unlike others she never indulge you for unnecessary tests n medications. She understands the pain n mindset of patients so well. I can bet all patients feels the same for her. She is a blessing for all patients. Happy and lucky to be with Dr Meghna.",

The approach with which doctor connected and guided us, is really appreciative. She focused on the solution rather than discussing and analyzing the problem statement with us. At all the times she did shared with us the relevant information and kept us informed and along, thereby drawing a perfect balance. With her being at our side we would say this was indeed a normal (cesarean) delivery :-)\n\nShe is truly an expert both professionally and at personal level. \n\nThe easy at which she makes the key decisions reflects her command on the subject. There are no communication barriers when it comes to connecting with her, and this characteristic played such an important role for us and I am sure it would for all such first time expected parent's. Our relationship with her grew naturally from that of a patient and doctor (as normally expected) to that of positive, confident to be mother and strong sturdy medical and emotional support.\n\nThank you once again from us (Swati and Faisal) and of course our chota pataka little angel Ridah.

Doctor faculty is less and patients are more. The management should work on average visits per day and appoint more doctors.  It's a maternity home, pregnant females and patients with new born to toddlers face a lot of problem in sitting and waiting. \n3. In case of any technical problem, keep visiting patients informed so that they can decide if they can wait further or visit some other day.  Making them wait with no result is even more irritating. \n4. Your ground staff needs a proper training on crisis management as they start putting things on others when any issue is raised.  \n\nDon't know how much this feedback would be considered...
