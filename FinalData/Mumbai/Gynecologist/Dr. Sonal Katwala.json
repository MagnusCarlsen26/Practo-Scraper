Doctor came 30 mins late - not punctual at all\n2. Without even asking my reports, she started giving all negative feedback, that you are aged and there are high changes of complexity , you might face problem , this that in short all negative feedback without even checking the reports\n3. I believe should be having positive vibes but she was full of negativity \n4. No response on what\u2019s app messaged - doc asked me to take another blood test and share the report and post which she will confirm to get the Ultra sound done.\n5. I messaged her and she dint responded , after so many calls and follow up she got the audacity of reverting me back. Yet again she asked me to get the blood test done again after 2 days.\n6. After after one day when I messaged her with the report she dint reverted back.\n7. Upon calling her, she is yelling at me and saying what\u2019s the problem, I felt like god damit you only asked me to send the report and after confirmation get the ultra sound done\n8. I dint liked the tone and she was actin very pricy, she should know I have charged a bomb for this patient and she need to respond back in a nice way rather than yelling what is it that you want and bla bla.\n\nIn short - not recommended at all, *** ** ****** * ***** **** **** **** ***** ***** ******* ****** **** **** ***** *** ******** ** **** ******* Very aggrognt  she is. God saves all those to go to her for check up. Not at all polite and not at all kind . ",

Doctor came 30 mins late - not punctual at all\n2. Without even asking my reports, she started giving all negative feedback, that you are aged and there are high changes of complexity , you might face problem , this that in short all negative feedback without even checking the reports\n3. I believe should be having positive vibes but she was full of negativity \n4. No response on what\u2019s app messaged - doc asked me to take another blood test and share the report and post which she will confirm to get the Ultra sound done.\n5. I messaged her and she dint responded , after so many calls and follow up she got the audacity of reverting me back. Yet again she asked me to get the blood test done again after 2 days.\n6. After after one day when I messaged her with the report she dint reverted back.\n7. Upon calling her, she is yelling at me and saying what\u2019s the problem, I felt like god damit you only asked me to send the report and after confirmation get the ultra sound done\n8. I dint liked the tone and she was actin very pricy, she should know I have charged a bomb for this patient and she need to respond back in a nice way rather than yelling what is it that you want and bla bla.\n\nIn short - not recommended at all, *** ** ****** * ***** **** **** **** ***** ***** ******* ****** **** **** ***** *** ******** ** **** ******* Very aggrognt  she is. God saves all those to go to her for check up. Not at all polite and not at all kind . ",

Had met various gynecologists' on the way but it didn\u2019t help.. had almost lost our hope and confidence.\nWe came to know about Dr. Sonal Katwala thru one of our close friend who had recently became pregnant under her guidance. So we thought of meeting her.\nWe had great experience as a first timer.\nI especially loved how Dr. Sonal really took her time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options.\nKnowledgeable, sensitive, informative\u2026 I immediately felt at ease \u2013 and felt confident in my receiving expert medical care.\nUnder her guidance I too became pregnant and was one of my happiest day of my life.\nTreatment under Dr. Sonal was great during my whole pregnancy period, but one tragedy struck just 15 days before my delivery date. I became Covid positive.\nWe as a to be parents for the first time got  scared and all negative thoughts surrounded us.\nBut Dr. Sonal was calm and positive in that situation. She immediately suggested for C-section delivery and we immediately got hospitalized.\nShe was physically present during whole surgery with other covid specialists doctors. Surgery was successful and we were happy Parents.\nWe really appreciate her for all the effort taken by her during Covid period.\nDr. Sonal Katwala is incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.\nI highly recommend becoming her patient!",

                "review_text": "2 months after I had had a missed abortion (no heart beat was detected till the 8th week & therefore the pregnancy had to be clinically terminated), when I was scouting for a doctor closer home to save on the travelling I found Dr. Sonal\u2019s profile on Practo with some really positive reviews & booked an appointment with her \u2013 This, I now believe was the single most important step I took towards having my baby! Given my earlier failed attempt at having a baby, I was pretty low on confidence & had a very cautious & negative approach towards my prospects at becoming a mother. The detection of a fibroid & chocolate cyst in my pre-pregnancy scans made it only worse. However, Dr. Sonal remained positive & asked us to try naturally for 6 months before we consider other options. As luck would have it we achieved success early & step by step in each appointment, Dr. Sonal managed to increase our confidence with her calm & positive approach. \nThe thing I liked most about her is that she has no frills \u2013 She gives you the facts as they are, doesn\u2019t panic * **** *** ** ** *********** ****** patiently answers your questions (however silly they may be) & explains her prescriptions \u2013 i.e, what purpose each of the medicines she\u2019s prescribing serves \u2013 This helps a great deal! Especially since most women begin taking medicines as a routine for the first time in their lives when pregnant & knowing what each medicine is for, helps commit to the routine! \u2013 at least it worked wonders for me\nLastly, I was always fixated at having a \u2018Normal Delivery\u2019, she asked me to be mentally prepared for both & I did, considering my history & the fact that I was delivering a baby at a \u2018not so favourable\u2019 age of 32yrs. But when the time came, she ensured that she does everything in her hand to facilitate a Normal delivery for me & my baby! In the OT too, it was her calm & clear instructions that guided me through the pain & helped me get done with the delivery in under 10mins! Just trust her to do the right thing & you will be through!! That\u2019s what I did!",

                "review_text": "I am Dr Sonal Katwala's patient since 2 years. I recently delivered a Baby boy (May 2023) under her supervision. I used to visit her for my PCOS condition and she handled my case really well. She never put me on any birth control pills and gave me proper advice as well as some multi vitamins supplements which led to regular periods. After my PCOS treatment we decided to plan a baby under her guidance. She suggested follicular study of ovulation as i had irregular period cycle of sometimes 45days to 60days. In 3rd follicular cycle i conceived. Right from pre pregnancy guidance to through the pregnancy and post that, the experience has been very satisfactory and wonderful. She has been extremely honest, always gave us clear instructions and advice. She was always available a phone call away during any urgent situation. The every 15 days follow ups helped to judge any complications in the pregnancy. Sterling hospital that she suggested was also extremely good in terms of ventilation, cleanliness and service.  I aimed for a normal delivery, however, it looked difficult as even after 24hrs of labour journey i wasn't dilated as needed. I had an emergency C-section but it went extremely smooth. The rapport she creates with her patient is very comforting and feels like home.  The best thing about her is she is straightforward and will give you all the pros and cons of the situation.  I would definitely recommend her and her team. Thank you Dr Sonal for such a wonderful experience.",

You helped replace the fear of illness with the trust of recovery. Your charming smile, Meticulous update on the planned line of action and your confidence were very reassuring.\nIt is all thanks to you and your positivity that I managed to be on my feet so soon after the surgery.\nThe belief you showed in me\u2026.. helped me take up the surgery with positivity and confidence.\nYou have ensured me the best possible service and it is your magic that has healed me!

Dr Sonal is a good and professional doctor, soft spoken and made the entire pregnancy journey comfortable. She is very transparent in sharing knowledge and information related to treatment. We were completely reliable on her advise throughout and I must say we were in safe hands.\nWe choose to go ahead with Sterling hospital for delivery. Since there was no natural labor until my due date I got admitted for induction. Was under complete observation of hospital staff and Dr Sonal for a day and we got full support from all staff in terms of room allocation, help during labor phase and post delivery.\nDuring labor there were critical situations but with Dr Sonals support and guidance the entire experience was smooth and stress free and I had a normal delivery. We, Shweta and Ajinkya are blessed with a sweet and healthy baby boy on 28th June 2019.\nWe would like to thank Dr Sonal Katwala for making our experience of becoming first time parents a blessed and positive one. Our best wishes to Dr Sonal for future.",

We came to Dr. Sonal after we had unsatisfactorily consulted a gynaecologist at a specialised maternity hospital and from the minute we checked into her clinic, she put us at ease. She encouraged us to ask questions and well, we did have a lot of questions and she was wonderful everytime answering them understanding our mindset as first time parents and providing exceptional care.\n\nWe knew our baby was in the right hands when she guided us right through the regular checkups tracking the growth of our baby boy which was explained to us in detail following every test and/or sonography right upto which hospital to chose being the most accommodating one as per our needs and budget. The whole birthing process was explained to us in detail days before the delivery day for us to be comfortable on the \u201cThe Day\u201d\n\nWe bought our baby boy into the world extremely smoothly with the help of Dr. Sonal guiding us throughout and making a normal delivery possible up until today. She is one of those doctors who not only know what to do but also know how to do it. We are glad we chose her and would recommend Dr. Sonal Katwala to any parents who are new to the birthing process and/or want to have an active role in the process of welcoming their child into the world.\n\n\n-Karishma & Danil Pahuja\n ",

She has been extremely honest, always gave us clear instructions and advice. She was always available a phone call away during any urgent situation. Sterling hospital that she suggested was also extremely good in terms of ventilation, cleanliness and service. The c-section delivery was done very quickly and I don\u2019t remember being in pain at all. I would highly recommend Dr. Sonal as someone who you can truly trust! Thank you once again doctor.",

Every 15 days, we had a fixed appointment with the doctor, where she would check all the necessary vitals and things to be taken care of till the next appointment. \nAs per Dr. Sonal's recommendation, we booked the Sterling Hospital for the delivery. With no surprises, the same was the right choice that we made. All the facilities and support provided by hospital staff and doctors early at 4:00 AM for our little angel birth was phenomenal. \nWith the correct and timely guidance by Dr. Sonal at every step, we are proud parents of a cute little angel.",

She answered all our queries patiently and the best part of Dr Sonal is that she gives time to her patients. We had a preterm baby in March , a day before the lockdown and trust me Dr. Sonal did everything in her power to make us feel relaxed during the lockdown period. Starting from hospital to NICU and the days in hospital, everything went smoothly because of her care. With no family around she was our family who took care of us during that critical period. I would highly recommend her without any second thought.",

Suddenly, I conceived and she has been a great support to me (Mentally, and that's what matters the most from a doctor during your maternity) she always says \"Hojayega\" with a smile to all my queries.\n\nLadies, I swear by her and I highly recommend her as despite having so many patients daily she never gets frustrated or even does the job for the sake of it. She is the best I could look up to. Looking for a happy and healthy journey in the future with her help.\n\nThanks for being there Mam. ",

She has explained us each and every thing very clearly and positively about the tests and results done at IVF. She has advised us to go to the operation because it was necessary for my health also. More importantly, she has psychologically motivated us and removed all negative points about complexity about having a baby at this age. She is so positive and confident, and she always suggests best for her patients so that we finally decided to go for  the operation and for further treatment under her only.\n\nMy operation done well, her team in the operation theatre all are well qualified and good in nature. Now I have recovered within 5 days of my operation.\n\n\n",

She has been extremely kind, patient, caring and understanding during all our visits and patiently answered all our queries and doubts. At no point in time, Dr. Sonal advised irrelevant tests / medicines and always gave her unbiased opinion. Even during the pandamic, she was in constant touch and used to take regular follow ups since frequent visits /meeting in person consultation was not advisable during lockdown. In today's time, very rarely doctor would prefer normal delivery while Dr Sonal encouraged and motivated us  for only and only normal delivery since the beginning.  We were fortunate enough that we consulted Dr Sonal and under her guidance and observation, we delivered a healthy baby boy!! I would strongly recommend new parents to be to consult Dr Sonal.",

She came in the morning and told my wife that she has to have normal delivery and she doesn't want to do any operation thing. I was so confident after that and my wife delivered the baby normally.
