"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy is a surreal experience for any woman; it certainly was for me. And it was made memorable at Fortis, thanks to Dr Anita Mohan and her team. Mercifully, my pregnancy progressed quite smoothly and thus my periodic consultations were quick affairs. As a first time mother-to-be, I had of course quite a few questions and concerns all the time that Dr Mohan would make short shrift of, to the extent that I was admittedly skeptical of her 'involvement' initially.

But by the time I delivered, I could confidently say I was in a great pair of hands. I was particularly keen on normal delivery, but she kept me grounded the whole time considering my baby's position was transverse for a while during the pregnancy. Without raising any hopes, she also corrected some notions I had about epidural usage (which helped me during labour time.)

Given the increasing infrequency of normal deliveries these days, I am rather fortunate and grateful for that I could have one. (Full disclosure: Distressingly painful recuperation post-delivery since I had a 3 kg baby, and some deep stitches).

Thanks once again to Dr. Anita Mohan and the team for making this divine experience even sweeter and memorable.",2017-01-19 17:02:02,False,True,Indira Karthik,,,

When I got pregnant I was in Banglore for first 3 months and in Calicut for 2nd Trimester reached Mumbai for my 3rd Trimester as my parents are in Mumbai.
Due to pandemic I was really concerned on travelling but I am glad I did and happened to visit Dr. Anita !!! Looks like gods plan to give the bestüòç! Since I experienced 3 doctors from 3 states, without any doubt I recommend her for Pregnancy. Following are the that are super impressive about her ( but not limited to üòé) 
1) She is punctual to the minute. You don‚Äôt have to wait to meet her at all( wherein I have waited minimum 45 mins at other hospitals) .
2) You don‚Äôt feel you are rushed for consultation at all. She explains you minute of the details.3)You are helped not only with physical issues but you get supported emotionally as well.4)She is very organised with everything(which you see missing in a lot of hospitals) 5)I had a C - section and procedure went so smooth.6) She will make sure you get the best experience.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Anita was perhaps the best life choices we have made to date! 

We chose Dr. Anita Mohan based on the reviews at various online forums, being my first pregnancy, we were a bundle of nerves during our initial days. However, our mind was set at peace after each visit with the doctor. Dr. Anita instilled confidence in us with her witty remarks and a simple ‚ÄúWelcome to Pregnancy‚Äù, and we would go back home all cheered up!

We consulted her for both pre and post pregnancy, she patiently answered to each of my gazillion questions & doubts during our visits. In my case, since there was no sign of cervix dilation even at full term, we ended up having a c-section. Dr. Anita talked us through the entire procedure and kept reassuring me in her cool and calm way during the c-section, which was a HUGE help as the experience inside the OT was a bit overwhelming and nerve-racking for me. 

The cherry on the top was when my husband was called into the OT to see our little angel‚Äôs first moments in this world.

She is extremely punctual, organized and she never suggested any unnecessary medications, tests or procedures during the entire year. 

She was very particular about getting the mother back to her former self both physically and mentally post pregnancy.

Dr. Anita made my pregnancy enjoyable! 

Tip: Make a list of queries before each visit!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Choosing a gynecologist to bring your prince/princess into this world isn‚Äôt an easy task. My husband & I choose to go to fortis hospital as that is the nearest hospital from home and selected Dr. Anita K Mohan based on the reviews on the web. Initially we were not sure if we did the right thing, but it is the best decision we made. Mine was a complicated case considering the position of my baby while at 39 weeks, despite she handled the case so carefully that I had a normal delivery (she rushed to the hospital as my baby ‚Äòs heart beat wasn‚Äôt stable and she stayed all night in the hospital while my labor was in progress,  how many doctors would do this?). She is very strict about the regime to be followed during the course of your pregnancy (weight gain, diet etc.) and I guess this is the exact reason everything went well. Otherwise the way she interacts with confidence, care and her awesome wit & sarcasm makes it a joy and that also builds up the confidence in you too. Her expertise, care, guidance and transparency made my complete pregnancy journey a smooth one.
I thought it is important to share this as it might help someone in choosing a right gynecologist.
