We were trying for pregnancy since last 4 yrs.My wife's Amh was low and that was reducing in level and tubes were not clearly patent
We are a doctor couple still we had failure.  yess it is true...... pregnancy is luck but u need to do efforts in right directions and in Safe and extraordinary hands, and we were lucky enough to have that extraordinary consultant like dr jay mehata & it is confirmed that we r in right place when we talked with Dr.Jay Mehta first time....we went for IVF...2 emryos were transferred.
but unfortunately 1st cycle was failed
But we were positive...Dr.Jay mehta Also boost us for 2nd cycle, And that was necessary,u need to give some chance and even with each cycle ur egg quality gets improved and chances of success rate also.
We were not ready to do IVF with donor egg ,as If we can do Biichemical tests of the donor but there is no any other test to Check IQ level of the donor.So we decided only to try with our own eggs And We were lucky that my wife got pregnant with d 2nd attempt of IVF treatment.
This tm there was only one egg and that was hatched.
Dr.Jay Mehta showed me that beautiful hatched emryo  before transfer...And He said"" Dr.     dont worry u will be become parent with ur own eggs only""
His Smile and enthusiastic words generates a positive curruent in ur body....which surely helps u to reach to ur goal.
Now we r going to complete our 2nd month of pregnancy.I wish we will enjoy this journey of pregnancy and request god to keep our family safe and healthy.
I am thankfull of  Dr.Jay mehta and his very cool, and coperative staff..
And pray God to bless them always . As well as fulfill wish of each couple of having baby with their own eggs and sperms with sir's grace.

Dr doesn't have time to talk to patients, they won't tell you what's going on. No clear talks, nothing.

I got IVF done over there and my experience was bad. We started the procedure. Cost they told us 2 lacs + blood tests + few medicines we need to get from outside + egg freezing charges rs. 15000 for 1 egg for 1 year .(Which was not a small amount for us, still we thought of going to him as he is well known). We started the procedure thinking it would be done in 2.25 - 2.5 lacs something inclusive of everything. We started the procedure and started with the injections and medicines. When they removed my eggs, They told me that my only one egg is properly formed out of 6-7 and that is also of poor quality, and that egg won't be of any use.
I started loosing hope and getting depressed as I was already not able to convince and again this. I started crying (IVF medicines takes a toll on your physical and mental health).

He very casually told us to do stimulation again (medicines and full procedure again) - for which we have to pay Rs. 2 lakhs again.
We were shocked that how casually he is asking for 2 lakhs rs and we didn't have any option as the IVF is still not complete. We thought it as a part of procedure and paid the amount.

We did whole procedure again and again when they removed the eggs, again only one egg was formed properly and this time it was of good quality.

Now at the time of insertion, they told us to pay Rs. 15000/- because they had frozen one egg for a month (which was not clearly informed at the beginning, all upar upar se talks, we thought the charges would be for the eggs that are extra and if we keep it with them for one year)
They also told us to pay Rs. 15000/- more for one more egg that they had kept when they removed first. I started crying and we said if one egg was formed initially, why didn't they insert it. And then if result is negative, we could have gone for stimulation / full procedure again. They didn't inform us that they have kept the egg, we thought it is discarded, they havent told us that they will keep the egg. Seriously no clear talks, they are in so much hurry because many patients are waiting in queue, ** ********* ******* **** *** ******* * ******* *** ** ***** ******** *** ******** ** ***

And the most ri diculous thing is after finishing our full procedure, when they gave us the file, it was mentioned that 2 eggs inserted and both are of AA (good) quality. First procedure paper says, the egg is not of good quality, now they are mentioning both eggs are of good quality.
** ********* **** **** *** ****** ** * *** *** ******* ******* ** **** *** ***** **** ** **********

When our result came negative, we went to meet the doctor, he said we will try for one more time (again we need to pay around 2.5 lakhs + others), and if the result comes negative, then you leave everything as you are not going to have kid in future and enjoy life. (Which doctor says such things?)

Also, after that he gave us medicine worth rs. 7000 for increasing sperm and for females and he said to come back after 2 days once my periods starts to start the new procedure. When we bought the medicines and checked, it was ayurvedic medicine for sperm and Satavari powder for female. Does ayurvedic medicine give result in 2 days?

We didn't go for further treatment with him. ** **** *** **************** **** ******* *** * ***** **** *** **** *** ****** ****** * ***** **** **** ******** **** ** ****** ** *** ** *** ***** *****

When asked about the injections that needs to be taken during the process doctors reply was “my nurse will show you how to take and TU LELE KHUDSE OR ASK ANY OF YOUR WORK COLLEGUE TO GIve YOU” as we are a very busy clinic and have international patients.I was shocked to hear that and at that very moment i came to know i have landed at a wrong place.
No in depth information of the treatment was given neither.
Was very unhappy and disappointed with the total experience.
