"Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"I got my baby delivered by doctor Harshika. 
I just walked in after having my ultra sound. But I must say it was perfect decision. This doctor never scared me regarding my pregnancy. She just gives sweet smile and says don't worry I am here and everything will be be smooth. Just take care of you and your diet.
I always wanted a normal delivery and at last I got my baby delivered normally.
It was such a homely experience in this hospital. 
Staff over here is very co operative. They really motivated me and were near me when I was in labour pain. At last I gave up but the nurses and staff they helped me to go through this journey.

Thankyou doctor Harshika for this good time with you.",2023-10-17 14:52:04,False,True,RAMNIK KAUR,,,
