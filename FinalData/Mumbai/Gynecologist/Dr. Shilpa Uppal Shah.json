And this is how I met the wonderful doctor Dr. Shilpa Uppal Shah.\n It was the wonderful experience with Dr. Shilpa. Very kind and friendly. She has handled my delivery with utmost care. Even though there was a nuchal cord around my baby, and  as I was the first time mother , I was worried about cord ,but she has made me believe that everything would be fine and trusted her. She is trustworthy and explained every aspects of pre and post delivery care. I would recommend her to every mother, be it a first time or second time mother. And by god grace, my delivery was smooth enough and in right & safe hands. Thank you Dr. Shilpa Uppal Shah.\n",
