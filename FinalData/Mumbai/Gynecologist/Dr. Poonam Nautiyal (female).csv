"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Pregnancy Hypertension (Preeclampsia/ Eclampsia),Pre and Post Delivery Care,Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,Caesarean Section (C Section),",0,0,YES,"Extremely proactive, very strong commitment and sense of responsibility, deeply empathetic, near 24/7 availability for patient, always flexible to accommodate the patient‚Äôs needs, very professional yet so humane, permanently cheerful, humorous and warm.

These are how I would try to summarise Dr Poonam Nautiyal in a few key words.

My wife and I had an earlier unsuccessful pregnancy primarily due to the negligence and lack of responsibility of our previous obstetrician. The event was extremely traumatic for both of us. So the second time, we were quite concerned about getting a good obstetrician, especially who can manage the deep set fear and trauma of my wife, and help us conclude the pregnancy successfully. 

We searched in Practo, and found Dr Poonam, amongst a few others. But we liked her profile since there were many good reviews about her. 

It‚Äôs been about 9 months since we have been interacting with Dr Poonam. During the course of time, she managed to create an environment of safety and trust for my wife, through consultations to the extent that my wife got deeply attached to her emotionally. In this time interval of 9 months there have been times where Dr Poonam was unavailable for physical consultation for a couple of weeks. But she provided us with a backup doctor to handle any emergencies. Even while she was travelling, Dr Poonam was still always available for telephonic consultations. Hats off to her dedication. Her concern for my wife seemed similar to her own daughter. 

We are now the happy parents of a newborn baby. The baby was born in Surya Hospitals via Cesarean (because of the previous mishap we didn‚Äôt want to take chances). Prior to the surgery, Dr Poonam had let us talk to one of her patients who had just delivered via Cesarean to check how easy or difficult it is to recover after a Cesarean, and associated first hand experiences.

Dr Poonam helped us with the hospitalisation. She also explained to us that we might need an attendant for the mother and baby post operation and gave us references for attendants. She was extremely supportive for all our requests. She got her own team to perform the operation. It was done at the exact time of our choice, the surgery went perfectly well. She even invited me to be there physically in the operating theatre so that I could provide emotional support to my wife during the surgery. I have found Dr Poonam extremely thoughtful and sensitive in these matters - she comprehends these innate needs of a to-be-parent couple so easily. Her emotional intelligence must be extremely high. 

The operation has gone very well. My wife recovered extremely fast from the operation and was mobile within a couple of days (we thought it would be weeks). 

In a world where there are so many reckless doctors (like the one we had the misfortune to consult for our first baby), it is doctors like Dr Poonam who bring back our faith for the medical profession. 

I am humbly thankful, grateful, and fortunate, as a husband and a parent, to have been blessed with an angel like Dr Poonam. 

For any expectant mother / father, I will highly recommend Dr Poonam - you will be in very safe hands, and I am talking from the perspective of a first hand wonderful experience.",2023-07-23 14:17:39,False,True,Haryy G,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Poonam Nautiyal is a very genuine and supportive doctor. We found her via practo app and basis the feedbacks wanted to give it a shot to find a suitable doctor for us.

Before going to her I had been visiting another doctor for initial two months of my pregnancy and I must tell you that all our visits lasted for not more than five minutes and all she use to say was ""sab Khao, travel ka Dhyan rakho"". I was never told the initial struggles of pregnancy nor any medicine to take care of my weakness and vomiting. With such insensitivity I was on a mission to find a new doctor. Being new to Mumbai all I could rely on was the online feedbacks. After going through feedback for Dr Poonam Nautiyal on Practo we decided to meet her. Our first meeting had been awesome!! She counselled us for 30-40 minutes , explaining Do's and Don't, setting up the right expectations, explaining how body changes during pregnancy, etc. The best was when she shared her number and asked me to call her up anytime for any doubt rather than googling or consulting friends/ family. Please note, this is something which doctors usually never do!! After this visit we were clear that we are going to stick to her and an unsaid trust developed for her.

The visits had been really knowledgeable and for everything she guided us on, she gave us the explanation about it which gave us an assurance that we were in safe hands. Also, there was a bonus, which was that she not only counselled me but my hubby as well regarding my health and mood swings :D

During 36 week during sonography we found that the baby had turned into breech position which was kind of uncomfortable and something which made me feel very low. After receiving the call from the sonography centre, she immediately called me to comfort me and on our visit, the next day she mentally prepared me for c section in case baby doesnt turn back, comforted me and suggested that we wait for another two weeks, hoping the baby turns again! Post 38 week, we decided for a planned c section since the baby was still in breech. The surgery was very very very smooth and painless. During our stay in hospital, she visited us often, called us in evening to enquire about my health, taught me breastfeeding, took me for my first walk post c section and guided me on my new journey called motherhood. Also, post delivery we were guided us to get the baby checked since she was making some grunting noise. At this moment, she had been more than a family to us and went with my hubby to child speciality hospital to get the her checked up as quickly as possible (Pls note, this is something we don't expect from a doctor but she did) 

I am glad I am putting this feedback for her. ***** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * ***** **** ***** I have been truly blessed. Without doubt I would recommend her for your all gynaecology needs. 

Totally reliable, genuine doctor who makes your pregnancy journey very smooth and assuring everything will be taken care off thereby easing you of any stress or tension.

Thanks you sooooo much doctor!!!

None,None,0,0,YES,"Hello All, I want to share my life saving pregnancy case with you all. First I would like to thank Dr Poonam Nautiyal for saving me and my child. After getting pregnant I ws so happy and ws thinking of giving the best for self and my baby. So I started wt my consultation in hiranandani. One of the top hospital. Lot of spending.. blood test, sonography, n many other test. My first pregnancy so ws not sure if I ws doing right. But smwhr my mind ws not satisfied n ws a bit nervous..thinking all OK. . One of top category dr I ws consulting but all visit I got to meet Jr dr asking me do test n even the main dr insisted do several test to confirm gud health of child. As we know dr at hira want to complete their target. They forgot to tell me my placenta ws low lying and I need to rest. Unaware of this I continued my daily scheduled and in my 6th month my placenta ws completely down n I started bleeding. It ws a nightmare. Approached hiranandani and they admitted  and I HD a HORRIBLE experience.  When asked dr she started shouting n suggested abortion. I didn't know wht to do.my husband and mom took discharge against medical advice. Frnd referred me to dr poonam. I ws completely bed ridden. I called dr n just talking to her on ph I ws a bit relaxed and positive. My problem ws bleeding. If I move I use to bleed. I ws at 28 week  and I had to go 35 weeks. Smhw I went for consultation and I can't explain the support dr gave me. She is a saviour. As days passed my condition ws more critical. There is no med which cn bring my placenta up. I ws afraid to stay at home. 1 and half month I ws admitted. Every day dr use to come n boost my moral explained things. I ws afraid of heavy med. Understand me she gv min med and explained me all reason of gvng those med. I used to trouble her every day but she kept her calm n supported me. I could continue my pregnancy only because of Dr Poonam.  She assured me all would be well. 35 th week n dr sd we can't wait and HD to do c section. I HD my schedule c section at 7 on 25th Oct.  But mrg 4 I started heavy bleed. I called dr n in 10 min she came n arranged all n at 5 I delivered my baby boy. All thanks to my sweet dr poonam. She is excellent.

Nw a days we run behind top notch dr but unfortunately they are behind money n don't care of spending time n explaining healthy pregnancy.. it's just reports and test. Dr poonam is amazing. She herself use to call me n explain all. If u really need a good care of ur baby and stay positive... it's only dr poonam. I really we'd like to thank from the bottom of my heart for giving me my lovely son.

Though the journey till this point hasn't been super smooth. We first met Doc in Apr'19 when me and my husband wanted to start trying to build our family. We met her for prenatal education and by Aug'19, we had conceived. But during our 12th week NT scan, we were told that the baby had Acrania/Anencephaly. The skull wasn't fully developed and would never be. It is a condition that isn't compatible with life. We were told to opt for MTP or Medically Terminated Pregnancy and the very next went to Criticare Andheri for the procedure. Though it's a small surgical procedure, usually conducted at OPD, Doc ensured we got the OT so that nothing was amiss. She even suggested we send the fetus for genetic testing, just to be sure it won't be a recurrent issue. We were heartbroken, as any to-be would be, but Doc stood by us super strong and kept giving me the assurance that things will look up. After a month, we conceived again, and this time Doc was super protective of us. Increased number of scans, lesser travel (lockdown helped in that one as well), energy rich diet, walking and exercising. And everytime we spoke to her, she became less of a Doc and more of a friend. I remember when I was detected with short cervix at 26 weeks and suggested bedrest along with steroid shots for fetus' lung development, Doc actually came to my house and gave me the shot just so I don't have to travel till the clinic for it. Such small gestures leaves such deep impact! After my c-sec, I recovered so so well within 2 days, could carry my bub and walk in the hospital corridor. She taught me how to latch, while my other new mum friends struggled with it. And surprisingly, my son refuses to go to anyone other than us and Doc.

These are how I would try to summarise Dr Poonam Nautiyal in a few key words.

My wife and I had an earlier unsuccessful pregnancy primarily due to the negligence and lack of responsibility of our previous obstetrician. The event was extremely traumatic for both of us. So the second time, we were quite concerned about getting a good obstetrician, especially who can manage the deep set fear and trauma of my wife, and help us conclude the pregnancy successfully. 

We searched in Practo, and found Dr Poonam, amongst a few others. But we liked her profile since there were many good reviews about her. 

It‚Äôs been about 9 months since we have been interacting with Dr Poonam. During the course of time, she managed to create an environment of safety and trust for my wife, through consultations to the extent that my wife got deeply attached to her emotionally. In this time interval of 9 months there have been times where Dr Poonam was unavailable for physical consultation for a couple of weeks. But she provided us with a backup doctor to handle any emergencies. Even while she was travelling, Dr Poonam was still always available for telephonic consultations. Hats off to her dedication. Her concern for my wife seemed similar to her own daughter. 

We are now the happy parents of a newborn baby. The baby was born in Surya Hospitals via Cesarean (because of the previous mishap we didn‚Äôt want to take chances). Prior to the surgery, Dr Poonam had let us talk to one of her patients who had just delivered via Cesarean to check how easy or difficult it is to recover after a Cesarean, and associated first hand experiences.

Dr Poonam helped us with the hospitalisation. She also explained to us that we might need an attendant for the mother and baby post operation and gave us references for attendants. She was extremely supportive for all our requests. She got her own team to perform the operation. It was done at the exact time of our choice, the surgery went perfectly well. She even invited me to be there physically in the operating theatre so that I could provide emotional support to my wife during the surgery. I have found Dr Poonam extremely thoughtful and sensitive in these matters - she comprehends these innate needs of a to-be-parent couple so easily. Her emotional intelligence must be extremely high. 

The operation has gone very well. My wife recovered extremely fast from the operation and was mobile within a couple of days (we thought it would be weeks). 

In a world where there are so many reckless doctors (like the one we had the misfortune to consult for our first baby), it is doctors like Dr Poonam who bring back our faith for the medical profession. 

I am humbly thankful, grateful, and fortunate, as a husband and a parent, to have been blessed with an angel like Dr Poonam. 

For any expectant mother / father, I will highly recommend Dr Poonam - you will be in very safe hands, and I am talking from the perspective of a first hand wonderful experience.",2023-07-23 14:10:49,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
