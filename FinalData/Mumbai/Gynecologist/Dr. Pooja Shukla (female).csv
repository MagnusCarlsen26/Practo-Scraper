"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","High Risk Pregnancy management,",0,0,YES,"I cannot express enough gratitude for the exceptional care provided by Dr Pooja Shukla throughout our pregnancy. Dr Pooja made us feel comfortable, listened to all our concerns, and answered every question with patience and clarity.
Right from our first visit, she listened to all our concerns related to high-risk pregnancy. She managed multiple bleeding episodes, a short cervix, and many other critical problems throughout the pregnancy. She understood our needs due to our complicated medical history and provided the best care.
What truly sets Dr Pooja apart is her interactions with patients after every visit, we came out smiling forgetting all our worries. She gave us the confidence that we can sail through this without fail. She was always available 24*7 whenever we needed help. Throughout the pregnancy, she helped and explained everything she foresaw any problems and prepared us for that.
During the delivery, Dr Pooja was a pillar of strength and support. In the end moment when the baby was not doing great, she decided to do an emergency LSCS(C-section) and delivered our healthy daughter.
At each step, we trusted Dr pooja and never doubted in our mind about the treatment and care she was providing.
I always heard that doctors are like gods who save and give lives, and now I trust yes there are some doctors like that Dr Pooja is one of them.
I want to thank Dr Pooja from the bottom of my heart for helping us become parents after 10 years long struggle.

Dr Pooja is an Intelligent Doctor I must say. When I went to her during my last trimester as we shifted to Mumbai and wanted a reliable doctor. After visiting her in December 2023, I was convinced with her understanding. Her logic and basics are very clear. She is a very straightforward Doctor and gives clear information with reasoning if you ask her any questions or queries. She listens carefully even though she is super busy and gives answers and never ignores your question. She was very much comfortable with giving online consultation since we were coming from Far away (Wadala to Malad ) and due to Placenta Previa wanted to avoid travel. She gave proper support in this regard understanding the situation and was even ready to travel to CloudNine vashi center in case needed.The most important thing i liked was that she met me once in December 2023 and she remembered that I took only 1 dose of Tetanus only. Understand, it could be protocol for a series of injections. But she clearly remembered the second dose of pending was amazing. And gave me confidence for her to do Surgery on me.Just to add I have had a history of multiple miscarriages, multiple IVFs failures, and the age factor too. So it's considered to be a real high risk pregnancy. But thankfully i was fortunate and blessed with the baby boy bov after 10 years.She provided exceptional care throughout my pregnancy journey with her and delivery, demonstrating a remarkable blend of professionalism, expertise, and compassion.  During operation their expertise and quick decision-making ensured a safe delivery for both me and my baby.

What made it even more complicated was moving in to a completely new city for me ie Mumbai. Unsure about good medical facility in my nearby area I went to hospital Malad as it was a Maternity specialized hospital.There I met Dr Pooja Shukla and raised all my concern and health issues. She was a very patient with all my queries and she guided me regarding all my health concern.The first time I heard the heart beat of my baby me and my husband both were elated ♥️.But this was not it,  continuously juggling from office work to handling pregnancy was getting difficult. In my second trimester I got gestational diabeties, hypertension and severe abdominal pain. Dr Pooja Shukla was always there to constantly guide, gave me best possible medications and was keeping track with multiple sonography just to ensure that both me and the baby is fine. I cannot forget her constant reminder to me that ""Shipra for me both the health of baby and you is important"". Be it on overnight calls or early morning checkup Dr Pooja Shukla was always there for me. As I reached my third trimester due to hypertension, uncontrollable gestational diabeties I experienced breathlessness even I couldn't feel my baby movements. My heart sank and we panicked. My family immediately contacted Dr Pooja Shukla who was not in the town recommended me to admitted in a near multi-speciality hospital. Within no time she spoke to the doctor's there and arranged everything for me even before I could reach there. I can never forget the day called me at 12 in the night and ask me about health and reiterated that for me it doesn't matter if she does the delivery or the doctor in the other hospital her priority is our safety so that we are out of danger of risking our life. My situation was brought under control and the she was constantly in touch with the doctor's there .Finally after consulting with an endocrinologist her team Dr Pooja Shukla and we decided to go for an elective C section which was still risky as it was only 33 weeks and the baby was still very premature.

Before this, I had seen doctors at reputed hospitals in Mumbai, and can say that she's one of the best gynaecologist in the city that you can find. Pregnancy is not an easy journey, specially when you have complications involved. It's not just her medical advice, but also her counsel and support, which I received from Dr Pooja. Every time I visited her, I came back home with a smile and affirmation of me and my baby being healthy and in safe hands. She was always there to respond to my queries. I had two episodes of bleeding in my first trimester, running across Mumbai and Navi Mumbai consulting different Gynaecs. It was Dr Pooja who figured out the exact cause. I felt a personal care in medication provided by her. When I was put on a daily dose of injection Lonopin, I was scared initially, but she took all care and effort to make me understand reason behind my medication. She never takes queries on her ego, rather gives a definite medical reason behind everything. Among other things, one thing which stood out was that she took complete care and responsibility for the well being of her patient, taking calculated calls based on advice of different specialised medical practitioners. I also had an episode of rheumatoid arthritis where she made sure that the medication I was advised is safe for the baby, even though I was consulting a rheumatologist at the same time. At present I trust her to an extent, that even post delivery, I do not take any medication until confirmed by her. She has cared for me like a doctor and counselled me like a family.

I have been looking for a good gynaecologist in Mumbai since the past 5 years and have been struggling to find one who is empathetic, a listener and gives you ample time to address all your concerns etc. Thanks to my pregnancy, we happened to visit Cloudnine and we were referred to her by a friend. And honestly, my pregnancy felt like a breeze with her support and consultations. What an expert she is - regular check ups, report analysis, making me understand what's going on with my body, what and what not to expect, no unnecessary medicines or tests, patience of listening to all my queries and more so showing empathy (which is rare to find in good doctors) , explaining in detail each and every aspect of why these tests/medicines are being recommended and how will they help, friendliness and patience- she has it all! 
We started with Cloudnine thinking let's start looking for a consulting gynaecologist and we might need to visit 3-4 before we find the doctor of our choice/preference and luckily enough our search started and ended with Dr. Pooja and we were confident that we were in good hands from Day 1 itself :) During the course of time we were so comfortable and confident in Dr. Pooja that we did not go to our home town where our family was and decided to deliver in Mumbai itself under her guidance :)
I am now a mother of a 1 month old boy and my pregnancy has been a wonderful experience thanks to her, all the support she provided and more so being available to answer and address the slightest queries that we had. Rarely we find a doctor who is so approachable round the clock, empathetic, patient, follow ups just to check how you are doing, and an expert on the topic!

"Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"I am a patient with a history of myomectomy, Level 4 endometriosis and ANA therefore conceived through IVF. As if these werent enough I ended up having delivery complications with a ruptured bladder. Dr Pooja Shukla managed all of these with such extreme confidence and grace that today i have my lovely daughter by my side which otherwise wouldnt have been possible.

My journey to my pregnancy started a year back with surgeries for hernia, myomectomy and endometriosis followed by IVF. During this time ive met close to a dozen of OB/GYNs of which some were HOD or they were celebrity doctors that are deemed as the “best” doctors in town as per google but none of them matched up to what Dr. Pooja was capable to do in my case.
I met Dr. Pooja post conceiving through IVF in my 6th month of pregnancy. We ( i and my husband) met her after a lot of research on the internet. So far we always went for doctors with years of experience as I believed experienced doctors would be able to manage my case better but as Dr. Pooja is a high risk case expert and reading the feedback/various cases of her patients we thought of ditching my clause of experience for a change. 
And an expert she is! After patiently listening to my entire case she gave us a clear view of the possible challenges and complications ahead of us. She meticulously followed an organised method of elimination to ensure right medicines and care was taken. She was also connected with me everyday since day 1. If ever i missed she would check on me herself! And on the day of delivery i couldnt be more thankful for her eye for detail and judgment on my situation which otherwise would have been dismissed costing us our child. 

There are several doctors out there but there are very few who are passionate about being one. Dr. Pooja is one of those few who is a doctor by choice. Her professionalism and empathy especially towards my family through the journey and more so at the time of 3hr-long surgery is something i and my husband will always be grateful for. We now find a friend and a guide in her with whom we would love to be connected for long.",2022-12-30 11:17:55,False,True,Jyotsna,,,

I met her few yrs back with lots of anxiety and fear not knowing which direction to go...
Within seconds I was comfortable as if some old friends...
She motivated me and my husband after alleviating all our anxiety, teaching us the right steps in t right direction, taking opinion from other experts ....

Shortly after I  conceived in 2018, and lost my baby in my 8th month without any visible cause.

More than me she had cried.
More than me she had worried.
More than me she had tried searching for t cause.
More than me she prayed for my baby.....


And after immense research, we came to few conclusions....
I then conceived in May 2020, shortly after the lockdown, and to everyone's surprise, I was blessed with twins

Now started the real challenge, 
Injections, sonographies, medicines, food habits, everything was thoroughly monitored.
She made everything so smooth, as if it was a cake walk....

Lots of people were shocked that I was under her care even after losing my first baby...
But in my heart I knew, if someone cared for my babies more than me , it was HER....

At 31 weeks, she noticed few changes in my sonographies, which were too minor to b acted upon.. but she was prompt to pick it up and brave to intervene..

I just closed my eyes n I trusted her without a second thought..
And when I opened my eyes, they were right in front of me, my miracles..

Dr Pooja is a God sent angel for my family.
She made sure everything went smooth and non traumatic for me and my family...

I m sure my babies will soon call her MASI MAA!!!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"‌It was this month last year that we met Dr. Pooja Shukla for the first time. Conceiving, had been a long wait in my married life, rather one diminishing flare of hope. We had tried other doctors, nothing worked. Maybe we were destined to be delivered at the hands of this angel, Dr. Pooja. How else do we explain it. Right from the first meeting, she explained to us every small detail which was important as it was a late conception. During this visit itself I felt absolutely comfortable with her. And, as we moved forward with our consultation, we realised different facets of her as a professional. She has a special touch. She had answers to all our queries. Her excitement was as great as ours. Her prompt response and explanations were assuring to us. Her approach to solve any problem was unique and systematic. I delivered my baby in lockdown. She not only provided us with the list of medicines that we were supposed to have during pandemic but went out of her way to help us during the lockdown. It is because of her that we decided to stay in Mumbai for delivery. I think she is a super doctor and a fantastic human being. She knows her topic very well. She is confident. She will also follow up regularly to check her patients update. She will be often found zipping around the Cloud 9 lobbies always for her patients. The best part is her human touch....and that cannot be measured on any scale. It is difficult to find such doctors nowadays.
Today I have my baby with me who is fit and fine.
We are very happy and proud parents. All thanks to Dr. Pooja for her efforts and support during this time of pandemic. We pray every expectant couple to be blessed with a doctor like her. When I was taken to the delivery room during lockdown, and my husband couldn't be around me due to the pandemic protocol, he told Dr. Pooja, you are her only friend accompanying her. So True. She is a doctor, a friend, a silent support....you will know it and feel it. God Bless her!",2020-10-31 16:50:43,False,True,Ar.Reva Burli,,,

Our meeting with Dr. Pooja was fateful and in my opinion something that destiny had in store for me. So our was an IVF Conception and we were elated at the thought of finally having our first child. We thought it was going to be a smooth ride but unfortunately It wasn’t to be. For my routine scans and pregnancy follow-ups, I decided to visit the Women’s Hospital Khar as I & my family had been visiting that hospital for the past 20 years for our gynaecology related issues. Our initial consultations and scans were good. The pregnancy was progressing well and I was on course with my medication & high protein diet which my doctor had advised. However In my 7th month of pregnancy, one of the days I felt that the foetal movements were not the usual. I called the hospital and was asked to come in for a doppler check. The heartbeat was normal and my doctor advised me to come in for a scan the next day. Looking at the scan, the sonologist informed us that my AFI has significantly dropped and from 15 to 9, although the growth parameters were normal until then. My Doctor advised me to go on a high protein diet and take 3 alamine infusions in 9-10 days. I followed and we were asked to get a scan done after 2 weeks. In the follow-up the AFI was stagnant at 8, however the growth parameters had dropped and our baby was not growing as per gestational age. My doctor tagged the slow growth to the low AFI and the mother’s nutrition not reaching the baby which she said happens. In our follow-up scan after 2 weeks the parameters had fallen even further and my doctor just asked me to keep on with the diet and follow up after 2 weeks. During this entire period my doctor did not think of investigating ‘Why the AFI was falling?’. Considering I reside in Kandivali, we had thought of going to Cloudnine in my last stages of pregnancy to keep it was a backup option in case of emergency. However the circumstances were such that we thought of visiting Cloudnine for a second opinion, we booked an appointment with Dr. Pooja considering her background and reviews. In our first meeting which was 3 days after our last scan, she patiently listened to our entire case history and her first action was to investigate’ Why my AFI was low’. She explained us the factors why it happens during which she mentioned placental calcification as one of the reasons why AFI and growth reduces. She got a few blood tests done which came out normal. She also got an NST done to check the well being of the baby and a scan done to check on the calcification. The scan confirmed the presence of calcification in the placenta, however looking at the NST she thought lets push it as much as we can with close monitoring to ensure the baby does not have to be in the NICU for long. She gave me an injection to prepare the baby for an early delivery and at the same time put me on a blood thinner injection so that my nutrition can reach the baby. She put us on a closely monitored schedule of 2 scans, 2 NSTs, consultation, some medications to help with the growth and also advised on a diet which directly impacts the baby’s growth. After a week, we miraculously saw an increase in baby’s growth, the weight increased from 1760gms to 1962gms to 2114gms in 2 weeks. It was because of her approach that I could enter the 9th month of my pregnancy. After I completed my 35th week she advised us to deliver. She always said,” You can give the baby all the nutrition it wants once its out, do not crave for 50-60gms of weight increase inside”. She delivered me and I had baby boy. The baby was doing well except for some grunting which was because of some fluid entering the baby’s lungs. He was put on oxygen for 4 days after which he was handed over to us. I am glad I met Dr. Pooja at a time when nothing was going right, I am glad she patiently listened to us, guided in the right direction and eventually delivered at the right time. I am and will forever be incredibly grateful to her. ",2022-06-20 10:16:37,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I'm glad that we came across Dr. Pooja Shukla while checking for doctor. In our first meeting we felt very comfortable with her approach and the fact that she would also be the surgeon for our delivery.

She was very accommodating and prompt in addressing each of our queries, even though quite a few of them were asked at very odd hours. We felt very comfortable with the fact that she guided us to make very subtle changes to our lifestyle. Thus certainly helped reduce all the stress & anxiety that comes from the advice of everyone around us, especially when you are a first time parent. 

Even during our time at the hospital, she took out time to specially visit us at midnight to ensure that we're feeling confident about heading back home with the baby.

The way she kept boosting my confidence along the entire pregnancy journey has also helped me avoid bouts of anxiety. I'm glad that we found her and as we celebrate our little one first month, we would recommend anyone in the Mumbai suburbs to consult her if you're looking for a friendly doctor to guide you along the journey of being a parent.

After having tried to get pregnant for more than an year, all the doctors I saw made me believe there’s something wrong with me. While nobody could understand what was the problem, they suggested me to go for painful tests like tube examination, etc. The day I saw Dr Pooja, firstly she comforted me and then explained everything possible that could be wrong. With just few blood tests she caught my hormonal imbalances and I was put on one tab twice a week and I couldn’t even finish the 2 months course and I got pregnant. Since then due to my hormones dwindling I had something or the other going on each month, like diabetes and thyroid and painful puppp but the way Dr Pooja took care of everything is just commendable. All the medicines I was put on were well planned and well thought, she even kept a chart of my pregnancy schedule with what’s needed when with her and followed up herself if I forgot to. On one of my regular checkups at 36 weeks, she spotted the baby heartbeat having dips with thickened water and she straight away planned for delivery. It was scary for sure but sikce I knew it was her, I had this faith that everything is going to be fine. She is literally a God sent person to me. I can never thank enough for all the support and care she’s given me at the right time. Never have met a gynaecologist like her ever, so clear and focused!
