"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"1.5 years ago, we visited a few reputed gynaecologists of Mumbai to choose our doctor. We were not yet pregnant. Our pregnancy was going to be ""high risk pregnancy"" due to a history of late miscarriage at 24 weeks during our previous pregnancy. Having done enough research, our conversations were centred around two topics:
- identifying the cause of our previous pregnancy loss
- understanding the plan of action during this pregnancy (to avoid any mishap)
Not fully satisifed by several renowned gynaecologists, we ended up in the cabin of Dr. Nikhil Datar. And what a fortunate day it was, for we found a doctor who answered all our questions even before we asked them. We were simply listening the entire time. It was evident that he specializes in high-risk pregnancies.

When we left his cabin that day, we were smiling ear to ear, for we knew everything is gonna be fine this time because we had Dr. Datar with us. :-)

Before we started planning again, he got me tested to rule out the causes of earlier miscarriage. Finally, we were down to two - vaginal infection and weak cervix. Both played a crucial role in our pregnancy this time as well.

When we got pregnant, he asked me to be extremely vigilant and raise as many alarms as possible. In his own words, ""Feel free to raise 100 alarms. We will address all of them with full rigour. Even if 1 of them is true (rest 99 false) and we are able to address that and avoid a mishap, we would be successful"". During the course of pregnancy, I suffered repeatedly from vaginal infections which were effectively managed by Dr. Datar through minimum medications. At 4 months, there was a sudden drop in the cervical length (from 4cm to 3.2cm within a week). Normal course of action in this case is cervical cerclage. But Dr. Datar managed it by putting me on bedrest for 3 months and administering progesterone tablets and injections. At 6 months I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

Given all the complications, we were skeptical of crossing the 36 weeks mark, let alone have a normal delivery.

But miracles do happen! In December 2022, we delivered a healthy baby boy at 38+ weeks through normal vaginal delivery.

Undoubtedly, Dr. Nikhil Datar is the best gynaecologist in whole of Mumbai.
He is so experienced yet grounded, has a plethora of knowledge and very clear and systematic approach. On top of that, he is so jolly that he makes you smile even during the toughest situations. I had a laugh or two even during the last stage of contractions.

No words are sufficient to describe our gratitude for Dr. Nikhil Datar.

P.S.: He is always just a whatsapp text or phone call away!",2023-01-29 15:00:25,False,True,Samriddhi Singh,Thanks a lot .. for the kind words. I think our team did well. We succeeded because of the tea. Spirit,2023-02-04T15:52:42+0000,Dr. Nikhil D Datar
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"To begin with, let me give you a brief about our journey of shortlisting the doctor, the 9 months experience and the delivery during COVID-19 pandemic. We had approached Dr. Nihil Datar for our second opinion and that was our best decision taken. Believe me he is a person who will never give you any tension and is always to the point, to the fact in between you get worried that how can things be so normal? He is the best doctor you can approach without any second thought.  

Hospital Shortlisting

It was way back in September 2019, when the news got confirmed we were shortlisting the doctor for safe delivery. We were earlier consulting a doctor, who had a small maternity home. We were the only patient when we used to visit, and we were always asked to get the test and scan done from outside. Which raised a question in mind, whether the hospital has enough facilities to manage emergencies? Even basic scans were also asked to be done from outside. That's when enquired, we decided to shortlist a hospital which has all facilities like NICU, All scans(sonography), paediatrician, dietician, physiotherapist,lactation consultant and all other facilities essential for the pregnant mother and her baby.. (Based on my research NICU is rarely required, but it is better to shortlist an hospital which has this facility, because in case of emergency you do not want to run with the newborn). I stay in Goregaon and hospitals which I shortlisted were Surya (Santacruz), Kokilaben (Andheri) and Cloud9 (Malad). It was obvious for us to go with Cloud9 as it was the nearest and is meant for Gynaecologist cases. 

Delivery is a once in a lifetime journey and the 9 months are very crucial. Whenever we used to visit Cloud9, we used to see so many kids, parents and gonna be parents, that it was a pleasant sight to see.

Doctor Shortlisting

Once the hospital got shortlisted, it was time to shortlist the Dr. Again after enquiring with multiple people and online feedback we decided to consult Dr. Nikhil Datar. He is a very well known doctor in the area and has been practising for quite a long time. He was also referred to us by Dr. Nithya, Vaidya who happens to be our distant relative. When we first met him, we told him about our past medical problems which was a serious concern for us and the way he confidently accepted our case even we became confident that we can complete the 9 Months. 

9 Months Experience

When you first go for a consultation in Cloud9, you need to download an app, which becomes your reference for the next 9 months and beyond for mother and baby respectively. All appointments, payments and video consultation needs to be done through the app. Once you visit the Dr., normally the Cloud9 team makes you understand the package and gives you an hospital tour.  In our case we used to normally consult Monica, Shraddha and another lady with specs (Sorry I forgot her name) who helped us in understanding the package and the process. They also work to manage appointments on the floor for doctors.

Dr. Nikhil is normally assisted by Shraddha and Dr. Vishaka in Cloud 9. Ideally you have a follow up every month in the start and the gap decreases near the pregnancy date. In our very first consultation, Dr. Nikhil provided us with a sheet. This sheet basically has the common symptoms during the 9 months, and the medication to be taken for the same. Initially i thought what is this? But later I realised that this was our handbook. Gynaecologists get emergency at any given time and it is difficult to connect at a single go. So the handbook became our reference point for any general health issues.  During the consultation, Dr. Nikhil was always to the point and used to make us understand everything in detail.

For our scan/sonography we had consulted Dr. Smita Pawar from Cloud9. Since this was our first child, we always had tension during the scan, that everything should be normal. Dr. Smita was a wonderful lady, who made my wife comfortable and showed us each body part of our baby. Well, the way she used to explain in the scan, we used to eagerly await for the next scan.

During the 9 months we are supposed to take some injections and would like to thank the Triage Team for the same. 

When you register with Cloud9, you basically get a few lamaze sessions and nutritionist sessions complimentary. The physiotherapist Dr. Amruta Nagnoor who comes for your lamaze, is the one who attends you in the IPD too. She will be the one you are gonna thank later if you have a C-Section as she supports you to start walking and post pregnancy exercises. 

The D-Day

Our baby was delivered on 18th May, and it was really a tense moment for us due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Each day the cases were rising up, hospitals getting lockdown and residential buildings being declared as contamination zones. We consulted Dr. Nikhil Datar, and( opted for elective delivery) picked up a date for delivery. It was mandatory for us to get a COVID test done along with other regular tests. COVID test was like an examination test, in which we were relieved only when the result was out. One thing I would like to mention, Cloud9 was providing pick up drop service for all their staff, so that they do not come in contact with an outsider in public transport. This made us feel more assured. 

The entire process of admission was explained to us by Dr. Vishaka very well and she was a call away when we had any query. We got admitted in the morning and were scheduled to operate in the afternoon. I was waiting outside the OT, and was relieved when Dr. Datar came in. Due COVID issue, the hospital did not allow the partner to be inside, but the way my wife explained, there was a team of Dr. and Staff working towards one goal to make the delivery easy. Dr. Datar along with the anaesthetist was actually motivating my wife during the entire process and they safely delivered a daughter for us. Way my wife expressed it to me Dr. Datar had everything under control and the staff were confident since we were his patient. 

We were allotted a room in the 3rd Floor, and would like to thank the entire cleaning staff to name a few Pinky, Rafida and there was another lady who had helped us a lot and motivated my wife and assisted her. Would also like to thank Priya and Anjali sister for guiding us from time to time. And the entire TPA and billing desk team in processing the claim and settling the bill. Billing was perfect and everything we were conveyed by the Cloud9 team was correctly charged with zero complaints. 

During the stay in the hospital, you are visited by different specialists as part of the package. We had consulted Ms Dipt Shahi for lactation and believe me she knows what she is doing. She might insist you on doing something and that is only for the patient's good. She took out time and solved all our queries. Dr. Amruta Nagnoor (Physiotherapist) is a God, when you have a C-Section. She is the one who wil assist you in making you get up and start walking. Our pediatrician is Dr. Vinay Joshi, who had visited us in the hospital and we have shortlisted him as he was recommended by many too. 

There is a saying by Vince Lomardi (Ex-American Football Coach), “Individual commitment to a group effort--that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.”. Dr Nikhil Datar and his team are committed to making sure you have an easy delivery. 

Few things to make a note:
Gynaecologists always have emergencies, so be patient while you're waiting for the appointment. 
During the 9 months journey, there are many times you will have queries. Drop a mail to Dr. Datar, he makes sure he responds to it or acknowledges it. We need to understand Dr. are occupied with patients and operations the entire day.
Refer the handbook which is bifurcated by trimester for any symptoms. Your query will be resolved there. If not then either call Dr. Vishaka, or Dr. Datar or the best way is to walk into the hospital as there will be someone to attend. 

Thank you Dr. Datar.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Datar is nothing short of a super fantastic guide and doctor. We are immensely grateful to him for being the guiding light during a pivotal phase of our lives, culminating in the greatest gift we've ever received – our sweet baby boy.

 Our journey with Dr. Datar began during the third month of my wife's pregnancy, shrouded in anxiety about what lay ahead. Our path was far from smooth, riddled with numerous challenges. Upon completion of 6 month of pregnancy, in the scan  fetal growth restriction due to absent end diastolic flow in umbilical artery came to light. Dr Datar managed the situation with great expertise and after some time when the diastolic flow in umbilical artery was reversed, he put my wife under continuous observation and personally monitored the condition of my wife and baby to be born. As soon as he sensed the activity of the baby was not satisfactory, without waiting further he delivered the baby preterm at 30.2 weeks. Now after being in continuous observation in NICU for 44 days the baby got discharged and is with us like a normal child.

 Dr. Datar's well-deserved reputation for handling complicated cases was evident throughout our journey. His remarkable ability to instil hope and provide unwavering reassurance at every step kept us moving forward with unwavering faith. What truly sets him apart is his exceptional knack for explaining complex situations with clarity, ensuring we were well-informed. We always felt valued.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Caesarean Section (C Section),Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"June 2022 is when Dr Nikhil delivered our baby girl via C Section and we are glad that we chose Dr Nikhil as our OB-GYN to carry out this procedure.Being first time parents we were unsure of the right doctor, and by doing a bit of research we heard about Dr Nikhil. The general fear that most women have about a male gynecologist was surely something that Dr Nikhil will help you overcome. We never felt uncomfortable with Dr Nikhil during our entire course of the pregnancy. He is an extremely kind and down to earth doctor who is well experienced and has a plethora of knowledge in his field of expertise. Throughout our pregnancy we were guided and assured that everything was going to be Ok. Dr Nikhil understood and explained all our doubts/ queries in lay man's terms so that we as parents were aware of what was going on with our pregnancy and our baby.We were always sceptical of having a c section as the recovery period for us would be longer, and the term 'Surgery' is something that always made us worry about. Dr Nikhil assured us that we would try our best for a normal delivery and only when he was sure that my breech baby wouldn't turn at all were we advised for a c section.During the procedure Dr Nikhil, used his experience and expertise to deliver my baby girl - who was having a double loop of cord around her neck, with the utmost care. We are pleased to say that the procedure was quick and efficient due to Dr Nikhil's years of experience. Post the delivery in the hospital Dr Nikhil visited us daily and checked on us, explaining the post delivery recovery period and precautions that we need to take.We are thankful to Dr Nikhil for all his help and we would definitely recommend him to anyone.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"This was my first pregnancy. I was not very comfortable about going to a male gynaec as I thought I could be more open and free with a female gynaec. Through references of family and friends, I decided on going to a female gynaec close to my residence.

I came to know about my pregnancy sometime in April, 2020 when the entire world was under LockDown due to the Corona Virus Pandemic. This put restrictions on movement and so we went ahead with the nearest choice. 

This being my first pregnancy, I had a lot of questions in my mind for which I was seeking answers. Unfortunately, I did not connect well with the female gynaec that I chose and so my expectations about having a good rapport and friendly interactions did not become reality. I was not at all comfortable and with each visit I was assured I need to change. Also, they allowed only the patient in and so the husband was kept in the dark if he had any questions to ask.

We started looking out for other gynaecs through references. We came across CloudNine Hospital at Malad which had a panel of gynaecs. I thought of going in for a male gynaec (although I could chose a female from the panel) and that's when we thought of first approaching Dr. Nikhil Datar. We had spoken to a couple of our friends / relatives about Dr. Datar. 

At CloudNine, one person was allowed with the patient. On our first visit, our first question was about the distance between Borivali and Makar and how that can be handled. Dr. Datar gave us so much comfort that it made our decision easier. We got answers to all our questions and I did not hesitate or shy away even once. He cleared all our doubts through his YouTube videos. I got a pool of information which is what I was seeking.

At every visit, I listed down what qts I had in mind. But I never ever had to ask. It was like he could read my mind. He always encouraged me to excercise at every point and motivated me that I was a fit case for normal delivery.

But as God had it planned for me, I had to do a C Sec. On the D Day in the OT, I couldn't for once make out he is the Dr who was to do my surgery. He was so calm and cool. The qt he asked me drove away all my worries. He said ""You look worried to me. Let's play some music of your choice."" 

I would say a super cool and go-to gynaec which I was looking out for.",2021-02-04 17:06:47,False,True,Dipti Kamat Joshi,Hey Dipti thanks a lot for the kind words. Highly appreciate that,2021-03-02T12:36:09+0000,Dr. Nikhil D Datar

After a horrific experience of premature infant death in 2020, I had developed fear of getting pregnant again and lost hope of being a mother. However I got over the incident and decided to take a brave step of trying for a baby. I decided to consult a doctor in cloudnine malad to seek opinion on the way forward. Based on reviews, I chose Dr. Nikhil Datar. I consulted Dr.Datar in November 2021, and after meeting him gained confidence and hope that I could get pregnant. I conceived in June 2022 and chose Dr.Datar to be my doctor. He took all precautions from day 1 and ensured that I would deliver a full term baby. I trusted Dr.Datar , my body and I sailed through the 9 months smoothly. His words during check-ups - ""Yes, tell me"", ""everything is fantastic"", ""Your doing great"" etc, itself were so comforting and would boost my confidence. We were blessed with a healthy baby boy early March 2023.

As baby was born in 26 weeks so he had multiple complication and could only survive for 23 days in NICU unit of Cloudnine. With the experience we had with Cloudnine, next time when we were expecting again, we immediately consulted Nikhil Sir. Under his guidance and supervision this time it was full-term pregnancy and ended up having a normal delivery with a healthy baby. Was discharged on 3rd day since everything was normal. Nikhil Sir came as angel in our life, when we look back after having a fabulous journey, we appreciate our decision to consult Nikhil Sir from day one and feel lucky to find him. Because God could not be everywhere, he made sure that we have doctors like him who have the gift of healing mankind. No words are enough to appreciate the service he has done.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Pregnancy is one of the most important phase of life for any woman. There are changes that are physical and mental and if there is stress related to pregnancy it can cost you your baby. I was stuck in a similar situation where due to my age (in early 40s) there was fear of baby developing Down syndrome and I was suggested by the gynaecologist I was referring to then, to go for Amniocentesis test which is an invasive test and which can harm the baby if not done in the right way. When I came to Dr. Nikhil Datar first of all he studied my report and comforted me saying there are very less chances of test coming positive. He also asked me to go for NIPT test instead of Amniocentesis test as it is non invasive and not cause any harm to the baby. The report was normal. Dr’s right approach and jolly nature helped me get rid of the stress and enjoy my pregnancy.
Later in my pregnancy due to age I also developed gestational diabetes and blood pressure which Dr helped me handle very sensibly with his positive and lively attitude and required guidance. With Dr Nikhil Datar I felt I was in safe hands and I delivered normal and healthy baby.
