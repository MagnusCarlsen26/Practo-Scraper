"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"1.5 years ago, we visited a few reputed gynaecologists of Mumbai to choose our doctor. We were not yet pregnant. Our pregnancy was going to be ""high risk pregnancy"" due to a history of late miscarriage at 24 weeks during our previous pregnancy. Having done enough research, our conversations were centred around two topics:
- identifying the cause of our previous pregnancy loss
- understanding the plan of action during this pregnancy (to avoid any mishap)
Not fully satisifed by several renowned gynaecologists, we ended up in the cabin of Dr. Nikhil Datar. And what a fortunate day it was, for we found a doctor who answered all our questions even before we asked them. We were simply listening the entire time. It was evident that he specializes in high-risk pregnancies.

When we left his cabin that day, we were smiling ear to ear, for we knew everything is gonna be fine this time because we had Dr. Datar with us. :-)

Before we started planning again, he got me tested to rule out the causes of earlier miscarriage. Finally, we were down to two - vaginal infection and weak cervix. Both played a crucial role in our pregnancy this time as well.

When we got pregnant, he asked me to be extremely vigilant and raise as many alarms as possible. In his own words, ""Feel free to raise 100 alarms. We will address all of them with full rigour. Even if 1 of them is true (rest 99 false) and we are able to address that and avoid a mishap, we would be successful"". During the course of pregnancy, I suffered repeatedly from vaginal infections which were effectively managed by Dr. Datar through minimum medications. At 4 months, there was a sudden drop in the cervical length (from 4cm to 3.2cm within a week). Normal course of action in this case is cervical cerclage. But Dr. Datar managed it by putting me on bedrest for 3 months and administering progesterone tablets and injections. At 6 months I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

Given all the complications, we were skeptical of crossing the 36 weeks mark, let alone have a normal delivery.

But miracles do happen! In December 2022, we delivered a healthy baby boy at 38+ weeks through normal vaginal delivery.

Undoubtedly, Dr. Nikhil Datar is the best gynaecologist in whole of Mumbai.
He is so experienced yet grounded, has a plethora of knowledge and very clear and systematic approach. On top of that, he is so jolly that he makes you smile even during the toughest situations. I had a laugh or two even during the last stage of contractions.

No words are sufficient to describe our gratitude for Dr. Nikhil Datar.

P.S.: He is always just a whatsapp text or phone call away!",2023-01-29 15:00:25,False,True,Samriddhi Singh,Thanks a lot .. for the kind words. I think our team did well. We succeeded because of the tea. Spirit,2023-02-04T15:52:42+0000,Dr. Nikhil D Datar
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"To begin with, let me give you a brief about our journey of shortlisting the doctor, the 9 months experience and the delivery during COVID-19 pandemic. We had approached Dr. Nihil Datar for our second opinion and that was our best decision taken. Believe me he is a person who will never give you any tension and is always to the point, to the fact in between you get worried that how can things be so normal? He is the best doctor you can approach without any second thought.  

Hospital Shortlisting

It was way back in September 2019, when the news got confirmed we were shortlisting the doctor for safe delivery. We were earlier consulting a doctor, who had a small maternity home. We were the only patient when we used to visit, and we were always asked to get the test and scan done from outside. Which raised a question in mind, whether the hospital has enough facilities to manage emergencies? Even basic scans were also asked to be done from outside. That's when enquired, we decided to shortlist a hospital which has all facilities like NICU, All scans(sonography), paediatrician, dietician, physiotherapist,lactation consultant and all other facilities essential for the pregnant mother and her baby.. (Based on my research NICU is rarely required, but it is better to shortlist an hospital which has this facility, because in case of emergency you do not want to run with the newborn). I stay in Goregaon and hospitals which I shortlisted were Surya (Santacruz), Kokilaben (Andheri) and Cloud9 (Malad). It was obvious for us to go with Cloud9 as it was the nearest and is meant for Gynaecologist cases. 

Delivery is a once in a lifetime journey and the 9 months are very crucial. Whenever we used to visit Cloud9, we used to see so many kids, parents and gonna be parents, that it was a pleasant sight to see.

Doctor Shortlisting

Once the hospital got shortlisted, it was time to shortlist the Dr. Again after enquiring with multiple people and online feedback we decided to consult Dr. Nikhil Datar. He is a very well known doctor in the area and has been practising for quite a long time. He was also referred to us by Dr. Nithya, Vaidya who happens to be our distant relative. When we first met him, we told him about our past medical problems which was a serious concern for us and the way he confidently accepted our case even we became confident that we can complete the 9 Months. 

9 Months Experience

When you first go for a consultation in Cloud9, you need to download an app, which becomes your reference for the next 9 months and beyond for mother and baby respectively. All appointments, payments and video consultation needs to be done through the app. Once you visit the Dr., normally the Cloud9 team makes you understand the package and gives you an hospital tour.  In our case we used to normally consult Monica, Shraddha and another lady with specs (Sorry I forgot her name) who helped us in understanding the package and the process. They also work to manage appointments on the floor for doctors.

Dr. Nikhil is normally assisted by Shraddha and Dr. Vishaka in Cloud 9. Ideally you have a follow up every month in the start and the gap decreases near the pregnancy date. In our very first consultation, Dr. Nikhil provided us with a sheet. This sheet basically has the common symptoms during the 9 months, and the medication to be taken for the same. Initially i thought what is this? But later I realised that this was our handbook. Gynaecologists get emergency at any given time and it is difficult to connect at a single go. So the handbook became our reference point for any general health issues.  During the consultation, Dr. Nikhil was always to the point and used to make us understand everything in detail.

For our scan/sonography we had consulted Dr. Smita Pawar from Cloud9. Since this was our first child, we always had tension during the scan, that everything should be normal. Dr. Smita was a wonderful lady, who made my wife comfortable and showed us each body part of our baby. Well, the way she used to explain in the scan, we used to eagerly await for the next scan.

During the 9 months we are supposed to take some injections and would like to thank the Triage Team for the same. 

When you register with Cloud9, you basically get a few lamaze sessions and nutritionist sessions complimentary. The physiotherapist Dr. Amruta Nagnoor who comes for your lamaze, is the one who attends you in the IPD too. She will be the one you are gonna thank later if you have a C-Section as she supports you to start walking and post pregnancy exercises. 

The D-Day

Our baby was delivered on 18th May, and it was really a tense moment for us due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Each day the cases were rising up, hospitals getting lockdown and residential buildings being declared as contamination zones. We consulted Dr. Nikhil Datar, and( opted for elective delivery) picked up a date for delivery. It was mandatory for us to get a COVID test done along with other regular tests. COVID test was like an examination test, in which we were relieved only when the result was out. One thing I would like to mention, Cloud9 was providing pick up drop service for all their staff, so that they do not come in contact with an outsider in public transport. This made us feel more assured. 

The entire process of admission was explained to us by Dr. Vishaka very well and she was a call away when we had any query. We got admitted in the morning and were scheduled to operate in the afternoon. I was waiting outside the OT, and was relieved when Dr. Datar came in. Due COVID issue, the hospital did not allow the partner to be inside, but the way my wife explained, there was a team of Dr. and Staff working towards one goal to make the delivery easy. Dr. Datar along with the anaesthetist was actually motivating my wife during the entire process and they safely delivered a daughter for us. Way my wife expressed it to me Dr. Datar had everything under control and the staff were confident since we were his patient. 

We were allotted a room in the 3rd Floor, and would like to thank the entire cleaning staff to name a few Pinky, Rafida and there was another lady who had helped us a lot and motivated my wife and assisted her. Would also like to thank Priya and Anjali sister for guiding us from time to time. And the entire TPA and billing desk team in processing the claim and settling the bill. Billing was perfect and everything we were conveyed by the Cloud9 team was correctly charged with zero complaints. 

During the stay in the hospital, you are visited by different specialists as part of the package. We had consulted Ms Dipt Shahi for lactation and believe me she knows what she is doing. She might insist you on doing something and that is only for the patient's good. She took out time and solved all our queries. Dr. Amruta Nagnoor (Physiotherapist) is a God, when you have a C-Section. She is the one who wil assist you in making you get up and start walking. Our pediatrician is Dr. Vinay Joshi, who had visited us in the hospital and we have shortlisted him as he was recommended by many too. 

There is a saying by Vince Lomardi (Ex-American Football Coach), “Individual commitment to a group effort--that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.”. Dr Nikhil Datar and his team are committed to making sure you have an easy delivery. 

Few things to make a note:
Gynaecologists always have emergencies, so be patient while you're waiting for the appointment. 
During the 9 months journey, there are many times you will have queries. Drop a mail to Dr. Datar, he makes sure he responds to it or acknowledges it. We need to understand Dr. are occupied with patients and operations the entire day.
Refer the handbook which is bifurcated by trimester for any symptoms. Your query will be resolved there. If not then either call Dr. Vishaka, or Dr. Datar or the best way is to walk into the hospital as there will be someone to attend. 

Thank you Dr. Datar.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"We consider ourselves extremely lucky and blessed to have found Dr. Nikhil Datar at the right time in our twin pregnancy journey.
Must confess we visited Dr.Nikhil Datar to take a second opinion and we are very glad that we did!

The doctor we were consulting earlier was regarded as competent, but we were not satisfied with the way she engaged with us: not taking time to answer our queries or put us at ease during our first/twin pregnancy. In fact after every appointment we would leave more worried than before.

We visited Dr.Nikhil Datar to take a second opinion. Zeroed in on him basis the great reviews on various sites. We had to travel around 90 minutes to reach his clinic in malad from our home in bhandup; and we were not really sure if that would work out on an ongoing basis. Given the bad experience with the earlier doctor we were rethinking if the doctor would be worth the time and effort to travel all the way. We decided to give it a shot anyways.
And we are grateful to God that we did. After meeting Dr. Datar for the first time we left feeling positive, upbeat and stress free. 
Here was a Doctor extremely competent but also more importantly genuine, warm and approachable. He had a long line of patients but still took time to answer all our concerns and assuage all our fears.
And from thereon every appointment was a positive and uplifting experience. We had our share of pregnancy issues, minor emergencies but through it all we were assured and relaxed because we, through God’s grace, had Dr. Nikhil Datar on our side to handhold and lead us onward week by week, day by day. He would take all the tension and worry away and keep us upbeat. Must also thank his fantastic team at Cloud Nine hospital Malad. Dr. Datar’s associates Dr. Meghana Shedge and Dr. Urva, our Sonologist Dr. Smita Pawar, everyone  was brilliant! They always paid attention to every detail and scans were done with utmost care and patience and would take time and tell us all the details of both babies and their growth rates. 

Finally on the day of delivery we had our lovely twins, Doctor ensured that the babies came out only after 36 weeks and that the babies left with mother, no NICU or any other complications. Recovery from surgery was extremely smooth.
 

From thinking at the start to whether this Doctor was worth time and effort to travel 90 minutes to his clinic, to thinking we will visit only this Doctor even if we are to move cities and, finally after delivery the one thought we had was What good deeds have we done to be worthy of a Doctor like him. Its only through God’s grace that we found this Doctor at the right time. Thank you for all the guidance, reassurance and handholding Doctor!",2019-08-17 00:32:18,False,True,Deepti Harish,Thanks a million. I have no words to express myself. Thanks for the lovely words.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Datar is nothing short of a super fantastic guide and doctor. We are immensely grateful to him for being the guiding light during a pivotal phase of our lives, culminating in the greatest gift we've ever received – our sweet baby boy.

 Our journey with Dr. Datar began during the third month of my wife's pregnancy, shrouded in anxiety about what lay ahead. Our path was far from smooth, riddled with numerous challenges. Upon completion of 6 month of pregnancy, in the scan  fetal growth restriction due to absent end diastolic flow in umbilical artery came to light. Dr Datar managed the situation with great expertise and after some time when the diastolic flow in umbilical artery was reversed, he put my wife under continuous observation and personally monitored the condition of my wife and baby to be born. As soon as he sensed the activity of the baby was not satisfactory, without waiting further he delivered the baby preterm at 30.2 weeks. Now after being in continuous observation in NICU for 44 days the baby got discharged and is with us like a normal child.

 Dr. Datar's well-deserved reputation for handling complicated cases was evident throughout our journey. His remarkable ability to instil hope and provide unwavering reassurance at every step kept us moving forward with unwavering faith. What truly sets him apart is his exceptional knack for explaining complex situations with clarity, ensuring we were well-informed. We always felt valued. Dr. Datar's jovial and positive attitude, even amid a demanding schedule, is truly admirable. He never let the gravity of the situation overshadow our hope and positivity.",2023-10-13 11:36:24,False,True,Manoj Kumar,Thxs. U r case was difficult to crack.

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"What happens when you are diagnosed with 4 problems during ur pregnancy and the 5th kne scares you to hell!??? Well read on .... 
First of all people hesitate to even think of going to a male doctor. But I started visiting Dr.Nikhil Datar since Nov 2015.That was in my 2nd month. 
Little did i know what lies in store for me after meeting this gentleman. He treats you like a friend. Welcomes u in his cabin with a big smile. Asks you how's life and what's going on. Checks you so comfortably. Ensures you that everything looks so good.The baby is doing excellent. Will chat with you and answer your most stupidest questions. Will chat with your husband and check how he is doing (very few people even ask for the husband's well being in those 9months).  He is a beautiful human being and a doctor who would make sure you smile when u enter his cabin and also leave with a smile
I was due in May. And i have had nothinf but an amazing experience with this doctor.I dnt think anybody would have had such a smooth 9 months journey to a beautiful and fun filled normal delivery inspite of having 5 big complications. I had 5 major problems - Thyroid, Diabetes (during pregnancy only), Fibroids, Arcurate Uterus and lastly the cord was around my baby's neck in the 38th week. Dr.Nikhil was so calm and cool all throughout. He never let me know that all this is actually counted as a complicated caseHe mentioned it only after I was done with my delivery.He just prepared me very well for my delivery and ofcoz a normal one. With so many complications,any doctor would have opted for a C Sec,but for Dr. Nikhil,he never discussed c sec with me at all :) Thank God! 
He is one doctor who would be ur friend, fight for your rights and not let you spend unnecessarily. No doctor would do that today. A genuine and transparent personality for a doctor in this day and age where all are either there to rip your pockets or not really be so involved as a doctor . Must say he is very ethically correct in every way !!! 
I dnt think I will ever come across a doctor who gives u so much freedom and let's u enjoy ur pregnancy so much.He rather motivates u to always b happy and enjoy the phase. The comfort he gives to his patients being a male doctor is commendable. I would never go to a female doctor, I have had 2 bad experiences in the first 2 mnths of my pregnancy :( 
I would just say, u can close ur eyes and blindly follow Dr. Nikhil Datar pre and post delivery. Post delivery because he would come to your room and share some very logical tips and reasons with your mom for what to follow and what not to. Trust me u will be happy following what he says :)
Dr. Nikhil is my God's gift to me...i had 5 PROBLEMS AND HE WAS MY 1 SOULTION.

This was our first pregnancy and we got reference of Dr. Nikhil Datar from my dermatologist doctor who was consulting him and had a baby few months back. Dr. Datar is the best doctor to have when you have pregnancy with lots of ups and downs. He guided us properly all throughout explaining us the possible scenarios and highlighted the risks but never forced us for any decision. He was always there to solve all our doubts/concerns howsoever big or small they were. Just before the D-day we discussed c-section with him and he gave that comfort and confidence that everything will be fine. And I would say the D-Day was quite smooth. The team of doctors assisting him is very competent and they keep explaining you what is happening in OT all throughout so you feel comfortable and less nervous. So overall experience with the hospital and doctors was very positive and encouraging. We are not from Mumbai and its been just a little over two years in this city. Its only because of Dr. Nikhil Datar and the way he handles everything, his knowledge and competence, that we decided to continue our pregnancy here despite the whole Covid scenario and our parents calling us back home for delivery.

We consulted 3 Gynecologists for the treatment but were not satisfied with their suggestions. Some were suggesting to get laparoscopic surgery done. 
We were referred to Dr. Nikhil Datar by a Friend. During our first consultation, On reviewing my reports, he advised and emphasized on getting an Open surgery done for the removal of multiple fibroids. He listened to us calmly, made us comfortable and explained us the procedure about fibroids removal surgery and post surgery facts. After the 1st Consultation itself me and my family, we were convinced to get the surgery done by him. 
The surgery was done within a month of meeting him.We decided to get the surgery done at Cloudnine Hospital-Malad. The Surgery was successful and fibroids weighing 2.1 kg were removed which is extremely rare for a 34 yr women. Post Surgery on the 2nd day I faced complication of Paralytical ileus. The Doctor explained in detail what was happening, making them calm and comfortable and how I will overcome the complications. I was discharged from the Hospital on the 10th Day of Surgery. The Hospital Staff is very nice and friendly. They took good care of me throughout my stay at Cloudnine Hospital.

Dr. Nikhil Datar is always smiling, calm and kept motivating me to get well soon. I resumed work post 1 month of the surgery and feel normal. Ofcourse there is care to be taken for the next 3-4 months.

She will be the one you are gonna thank later if you have a C-Section as she supports you to start walking and post pregnancy exercises. 

The D-Day

Our baby was delivered on 18th May, and it was really a tense moment for us due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Each day the cases were rising up, hospitals getting lockdown and residential buildings being declared as contamination zones. We consulted Dr. Nikhil Datar, and( opted for elective delivery) picked up a date for delivery. It was mandatory for us to get a COVID test done along with other regular tests. COVID test was like an examination test, in which we were relieved only when the result was out. One thing I would like to mention, Cloud9 was providing pick up drop service for all their staff, so that they do not come in contact with an outsider in public transport. This made us feel more assured. 

The entire process of admission was explained to us by Dr. Vishaka very well and she was a call away when we had any query. We got admitted in the morning and were scheduled to operate in the afternoon. I was waiting outside the OT, and was relieved when Dr. Datar came in. Due COVID issue, the hospital did not allow the partner to be inside, but the way my wife explained, there was a team of Dr. and Staff working towards one goal to make the delivery easy. Dr. Datar along with the anaesthetist was actually motivating my wife during the entire process and they safely delivered a daughter for us. Way my wife expressed it to me Dr. Datar had everything under control and the staff were confident since we were his patient. 

We were allotted a room in the 3rd Floor, and would like to thank the entire cleaning staff to name a few Pinky, Rafida and there was another lady who had helped us a lot and motivated my wife and assisted her. Would also like to thank Priya and Anjali sister for guiding us from time to time. And the entire TPA and billing desk team in processing the claim and settling the bill. Billing was perfect and everything we were conveyed by the Cloud9 team was correctly charged with zero complaints. 

During the stay in the hospital, you are visited by different specialists as part of the package. We had consulted Ms Dipt Shahi for lactation and believe me she knows what she is doing. She might insist you on doing something and that is only for the patient's good. She took out time and solved all our queries. Dr. Amruta Nagnoor (Physiotherapist) is a God, when you have a C-Section. She is the one who wil assist you in making you get up and start walking. Our pediatrician is Dr. Vinay Joshi, who had visited us in the hospital and we have shortlisted him as he was recommended by many too. 

There is a saying by Vince Lomardi (Ex-American Football Coach), “Individual commitment to a group effort--that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.”. Dr Nikhil Datar and his team are committed to making sure you have an easy delivery. 

Few things to make a note:
Gynaecologists always have emergencies, so be patient while you're waiting for the appointment. 
During the 9 months journey, there are many times you will have queries. Drop a mail to Dr. Datar, he makes sure he responds to it or acknowledges it. We need to understand Dr. are occupied with patients and operations the entire day.
Refer the handbook which is bifurcated by trimester for any symptoms. Your query will be resolved there. If not then either call Dr. Vishaka, or Dr. Datar or the best way is to walk into the hospital as there will be someone to attend. 

Thank you Dr. Datar.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"We consider ourselves extremely lucky and blessed to have found Dr. Nikhil Datar at the right time in our twin pregnancy journey.
Must confess we visited Dr.Nikhil Datar to take a second opinion and we are very glad that we did!

The doctor we were consulting earlier was regarded as competent, but we were not satisfied with the way she engaged with us: not taking time to answer our queries or put us at ease during our first/twin pregnancy. In fact after every appointment we would leave more worried than before.

We visited Dr.Nikhil Datar to take a second opinion. Zeroed in on him basis the great reviews on various sites. We had to travel around 90 minutes to reach his clinic in malad from our home in bhandup; and we were not really sure if that would work out on an ongoing basis. Given the bad experience with the earlier doctor we were rethinking if the doctor would be worth the time and effort to travel all the way. We decided to give it a shot anyways.
And we are grateful to God that we did. After meeting Dr. Datar for the first time we left feeling positive, upbeat and stress free. 
Here was a Doctor extremely competent but also more importantly genuine, warm and approachable. He had a long line of patients but still took time to answer all our concerns and assuage all our fears.
And from thereon every appointment was a positive and uplifting experience. We had our share of pregnancy issues, minor emergencies but through it all we were assured and relaxed because we, through God’s grace, had Dr. Nikhil Datar on our side to handhold and lead us onward week by week, day by day. He would take all the tension and worry away and keep us upbeat. Must also thank his fantastic team at Cloud Nine hospital Malad. Dr. Datar’s associates Dr. Meghana Shedge and Dr. Urva, our Sonologist Dr. Smita Pawar, everyone  was brilliant! They always paid attention to every detail and scans were done with utmost care and patience and would take time and tell us all the details of both babies and their growth rates. 

Finally on the day of delivery we had our lovely twins, Doctor ensured that the babies came out only after 36 weeks and that the babies left with mother, no NICU or any other complications. Recovery from surgery was extremely smooth.
 

From thinking at the start to whether this Doctor was worth time and effort to travel 90 minutes to his clinic, to thinking we will visit only this Doctor even if we are to move cities and, finally after delivery the one thought we had was What good deeds have we done to be worthy of a Doctor like him. Its only through God’s grace that we found this Doctor at the right time. Thank you for all the guidance, reassurance and handholding Doctor!",2019-08-17 00:32:18,False,True,Deepti Harish,Thanks a million. I have no words to express myself. Thanks for the lovely words.

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Datar is nothing short of a super fantastic guide and doctor. We are immensely grateful to him for being the guiding light during a pivotal phase of our lives, culminating in the greatest gift we've ever received – our sweet baby boy.

 Our journey with Dr. Datar began during the third month of my wife's pregnancy, shrouded in anxiety about what lay ahead. Our path was far from smooth, riddled with numerous challenges. Upon completion of 6 month of pregnancy, in the scan  fetal growth restriction due to absent end diastolic flow in umbilical artery came to light. Dr Datar managed the situation with great expertise and after some time when the diastolic flow in umbilical artery was reversed, he put my wife under continuous observation and personally monitored the condition of my wife and baby to be born. As soon as he sensed the activity of the baby was not satisfactory, without waiting further he delivered the baby preterm at 30.2 weeks. Now after being in continuous observation in NICU for 44 days the baby got discharged and is with us like a normal child.

 Dr. Datar's well-deserved reputation for handling complicated cases was evident throughout our journey. His remarkable ability to instil hope and provide unwavering reassurance at every step kept us moving forward with unwavering faith. What truly sets him apart is his exceptional knack for explaining complex situations with clarity, ensuring we were well-informed. We always felt valued. Dr. Datar's jovial and positive attitude, even amid a demanding schedule, is truly admirable. He never let the gravity of the situation overshadow our hope and positivity.",2023-10-13 11:36:24,False,True,Manoj Kumar,Thxs. U r case was difficult to crack.

None,"Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"What happens when you are diagnosed with 4 problems during ur pregnancy and the 5th kne scares you to hell!??? Well read on .... 
First of all people hesitate to even think of going to a male doctor. But I started visiting Dr.Nikhil Datar since Nov 2015.That was in my 2nd month. 
Little did i know what lies in store for me after meeting this gentleman. He treats you like a friend. Welcomes u in his cabin with a big smile. Asks you how's life and what's going on. Checks you so comfortably. Ensures you that everything looks so good.The baby is doing excellent. Will chat with you and answer your most stupidest questions. Will chat with your husband and check how he is doing (very few people even ask for the husband's well being in those 9months).  He is a beautiful human being and a doctor who would make sure you smile when u enter his cabin and also leave with a smile
I was due in May. And i have had nothinf but an amazing experience with this doctor.I dnt think anybody would have had such a smooth 9 months journey to a beautiful and fun filled normal delivery inspite of having 5 big complications. I had 5 major problems - Thyroid, Diabetes (during pregnancy only), Fibroids, Arcurate Uterus and lastly the cord was around my baby's neck in the 38th week. Dr.Nikhil was so calm and cool all throughout. He never let me know that all this is actually counted as a complicated caseHe mentioned it only after I was done with my delivery.He just prepared me very well for my delivery and ofcoz a normal one. With so many complications,any doctor would have opted for a C Sec,but for Dr. Nikhil,he never discussed c sec with me at all :) Thank God! 
He is one doctor who would be ur friend, fight for your rights and not let you spend unnecessarily. No doctor would do that today. A genuine and transparent personality for a doctor in this day and age where all are either there to rip your pockets or not really be so involved as a doctor . Must say he is very ethically correct in every way !!! 
I dnt think I will ever come across a doctor who gives u so much freedom and let's u enjoy ur pregnancy so much.He rather motivates u to always b happy and enjoy the phase. The comfort he gives to his patients being a male doctor is commendable. I would never go to a female doctor, I have had 2 bad experiences in the first 2 mnths of my pregnancy :( 
I would just say, u can close ur eyes and blindly follow Dr. Nikhil Datar pre and post delivery. Post delivery because he would come to your room and share some very logical tips and reasons with your mom for what to follow and what not to. Trust me u will be happy following what he says :)
Dr. Nikhil is my God's gift to me...i had 5 PROBLEMS AND HE WAS MY 1 SOULTION.

This was our first pregnancy and we got reference of Dr. Nikhil Datar from my dermatologist doctor who was consulting him and had a baby few months back. Dr. Datar is the best doctor to have when you have pregnancy with lots of ups and downs. He guided us properly all throughout explaining us the possible scenarios and highlighted the risks but never forced us for any decision. He was always there to solve all our doubts/concerns howsoever big or small they were. Just before the D-day we discussed c-section with him and he gave that comfort and confidence that everything will be fine. And I would say the D-Day was quite smooth. The team of doctors assisting him is very competent and they keep explaining you what is happening in OT all throughout so you feel comfortable and less nervous. So overall experience with the hospital and doctors was very positive and encouraging. We are not from Mumbai and its been just a little over two years in this city. Its only because of Dr. Nikhil Datar and the way he handles everything, his knowledge and competence, that we decided to continue our pregnancy here despite the whole Covid scenario and our parents calling us back home for delivery. We got that faith while consulting Dr. Datar that he would be the **** gynae to consult and in a city which is quite alien for us , we had that constant feeling that we are in safe hands as long as the pregnancy is concerned and that faith has only increased with each visit.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Fibroid Removal,Myomectomy,",0,0,YES,"In Mid April 2019, I was having pain in  lower abdomen for 2-3 days. Our family doctor suggested to visit a good Gynec post checking the sonography report. I had multiple fibroids with some measuring almost 15cms in my Abdomen.
We consulted 3 Gynecologists for the treatment but were not satisfied with their suggestions. Some were suggesting to get laparoscopic surgery done. 
We were referred to Dr. Nikhil Datar by a Friend. During our first consultation, On reviewing my reports, he advised and emphasized on getting an Open surgery done for the removal of multiple fibroids. He listened to us calmly, made us comfortable and explained us the procedure about fibroids removal surgery and post surgery facts. After the 1st Consultation itself me and my family, we were convinced to get the surgery done by him. 
The surgery was done within a month of meeting him.We decided to get the surgery done at Cloudnine Hospital-Malad. The Surgery was successful and fibroids weighing 2.1 kg were removed which is extremely rare for a 34 yr women. Post Surgery on the 2nd day I faced complication of Paralytical ileus. The Doctor explained in detail what was happening, making them calm and comfortable and how I will overcome the complications. I was discharged from the Hospital on the 10th Day of Surgery. The Hospital Staff is very nice and friendly. They took good care of me throughout my stay at Cloudnine Hospital.

Dr. Nikhil Datar is always smiling, calm and kept motivating me to get well soon. I resumed work post 1 month of the surgery and feel normal. Ofcourse there is care to be taken for the next 3-4 months.

Thank you so much Dr. Nikhil Datar for taking such good care and giving us the right advice for the treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Caesarean Section (C Section),Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"June 2022 is when Dr Nikhil delivered our baby girl via C Section and we are glad that we chose Dr Nikhil as our OB-GYN to carry out this procedure.Being first time parents we were unsure of the right doctor, and by doing a bit of research we heard about Dr Nikhil. The general fear that most women have about a male gynecologist was surely something that Dr Nikhil will help you overcome. We never felt uncomfortable with Dr Nikhil during our entire course of the pregnancy. He is an extremely kind and down to earth doctor who is well experienced and has a plethora of knowledge in his field of expertise. Throughout our pregnancy we were guided and assured that everything was going to be Ok. Dr Nikhil understood and explained all our doubts/ queries in lay man's terms so that we as parents were aware of what was going on with our pregnancy and our baby.We were always sceptical of having a c section as the recovery period for us would be longer, and the term 'Surgery' is something that always made us worry about. Dr Nikhil assured us that we would try our best for a normal delivery and only when he was sure that my breech baby wouldn't turn at all were we advised for a c section.During the procedure Dr Nikhil, used his experience and expertise to deliver my baby girl - who was having a double loop of cord around her neck, with the utmost care. We are pleased to say that the procedure was quick and efficient due to Dr Nikhil's years of experience. Post the delivery in the hospital Dr Nikhil visited us daily and checked on us, explaining the post delivery recovery period and precautions that we need to take.We are thankful to Dr Nikhil for all his help and we would definitely recommend him to anyone.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"This was my first pregnancy. I was not very comfortable about going to a male gynaec as I thought I could be more open and free with a female gynaec. Through references of family and friends, I decided on going to a female gynaec close to my residence.

I came to know about my pregnancy sometime in April, 2020 when the entire world was under LockDown due to the Corona Virus Pandemic. This put restrictions on movement and so we went ahead with the nearest choice. 

This being my first pregnancy, I had a lot of questions in my mind for which I was seeking answers. Unfortunately, I did not connect well with the female gynaec that I chose and so my expectations about having a good rapport and friendly interactions did not become reality. I was not at all comfortable and with each visit I was assured I need to change. Also, they allowed only the patient in and so the husband was kept in the dark if he had any questions to ask.

We started looking out for other gynaecs through references. We came across CloudNine Hospital at Malad which had a panel of gynaecs. I thought of going in for a male gynaec (although I could chose a female from the panel) and that's when we thought of first approaching Dr. Nikhil Datar. We had spoken to a couple of our friends / relatives about Dr. Datar. 

At CloudNine, one person was allowed with the patient. On our first visit, our first question was about the distance between Borivali and Makar and how that can be handled. Dr. Datar gave us so much comfort that it made our decision easier. We got answers to all our questions and I did not hesitate or shy away even once. He cleared all our doubts through his YouTube videos. I got a pool of information which is what I was seeking.

At every visit, I listed down what qts I had in mind. But I never ever had to ask. It was like he could read my mind. He always encouraged me to excercise at every point and motivated me that I was a fit case for normal delivery.

But as God had it planned for me, I had to do a C Sec. On the D Day in the OT, I couldn't for once make out he is the Dr who was to do my surgery. He was so calm and cool. The qt he asked me drove away all my worries. He said ""You look worried to me. Let's play some music of your choice."" 

I would say a super cool and go-to gynaec which I was looking out for.",2021-02-04 17:06:47,False,True,Dipti Kamat Joshi,Hey Dipti thanks a lot for the kind words. Highly appreciate that,2021-03-02T12:36:09+0000,Dr. Nikhil D Datar
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Since the day we conceived our baby we consulted a couple of doctors from Hiranandani and Lilavati. But we failed to derive confidence in their 5 mins of hurried consultation and lack of guidance on pregnancy related issues.

Fortunately one day a friend suggested Dr. Datar of Cloudnine. We decided to take his appointment. When we entered there we saw the assistant doctors, and the reception staff mentioned him with an unparalleled reverence and when I met him I understood why. 

His unique approach is filled with words of wisdom, a lot of humour, Care and Good guidance. When we came out of our first consultation after spending 45 minutes with him, I really stopped feeling like a patient. He made me believe that  pregnancy is a beautiful phase. Even though cloud nine is little far from our home, We immediately registered for delivery, as we wanted only Dr. Datar to deliver. 

He also taught us various things including No panick strategy, how to respond to symptoms when the due date is near, what to eat, various myths and notions of birthing.

Dr datar’s continuous guidance helped me keep calm during the entire delivery process and I delivered a beautiful baby girl. All that knowledge he imparted really helped us before and after delivery. Both me and my husband are really great ful to him for all his support and kindness. 

P.S. I would like to specially mention this that during the day of my delivery he was himself little unwell, but Inspite of that he kept motivating me on the OT table and helped me deliver a wonderful  baby girl.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"As a 38 years old I was on high alert when I became pregnant. And the ob gyn we consulted with initially, was a great doctor, but put me on a redder level of alert making me give up all forms of exercise and expect the untoward at any time. My partner and I went to Dr Datar for a second opinion after hearing of his expertise from friends and decided to stick to him not just for his professionalism but also for the calm and positive manner in which he handled all our questions and concerns. 

We were also drawn to the fact that he is also a lawyer involved in women’ health and reproductive rights issues - as a lawyer myself that was the clincher:)

He encouraged an active lifestyle and always provided proper and practical advice with a wide smile. Even where there were some complications in the pregnancy he gave us all the information and helped us make informed decisions. 

I was hoping for and had worked very hard to have a natural delivery and Dr Datar encouraged it. When my labour did not progress as expected and we had to decide for an emergency c section midway I was upset. Dr Datar’s words were reassuring when he said that it’s simply nature’s way of telling us to take help of medical science. And the c section procedure itself was like watching a highly trained orchestra performing. Everything was clinically sterile and yet, it was smooth, peaceful and everyone was simply great at what they were doing. I don’t know if the hormones and the drugs were getting me happy high but I though someone was even humming a tune next to me! And Doc brought us our little turnip in no time:)) 

I expected to be fragile for a long time after the surgery. And truthfully, the surgery took a heavy toll both physically and mentally for a few days which is expected,  but I recovered from the surgery pretty quickly and am on the way to full recovery over the next few months.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"A colleague of mine recommended me Dr. Nikhil Datar for that I am extremely grateful to her.
I had conceived, I was thrilled; but my previous miscarriage at 9 weeks would not let me enjoy the first 3 months of my pregnancy.

Every pain, every different feeling was a major concern. I would land up at the hospital hoping to be examined and reassured that nothing was wrong. When everyone thought I was being too cautious, my doctor understood. Finding a doctor good at his/ her skill is easy; finding a doctor who cares and understands his patients is rare. He is the right blend of caring, humorous and professional. Dr. Datar would patiently answer all questions, my husband and I would have, without any rush. Just by meeting him, you feel calm and reassured. I would always look forward to my appointments with him. The best part about Dr. Datar is that he is always reachable and extremely prompt at answering your emails. This was very important to me. 

Four reasons I would strongly recommend him:-

1.	He is completely at ease with the fact that millennials today will Google, read up a lot & have many questions; he would patiently answer through our list of questions during every visit.
2.	He does not push for unnecessary tests or procedures, and spends enough time explaining why/ when one needs to and need not, thus offering us an informed choice.
3.	He is always reachable – through phone or email.
4.	He helps you understand the various birth plan options and supports you with your choice!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"My 9 months journey

I am not a Bombay resident and my journey with Cloud9 and Dr.Nikhil Datar began after the two stripes turned purple.
I was most worried about being with a good doctor during pregnancy and after a lot of research, I came across Dr Datar's profile.
It was interesting to know about him, I read about him, from his achievements to his personality and decided to visit him with a positive hope of getting the right advise. My hope was never turned down and I always came out smiling and happy from his cabin. 
He was not just my doctor, he was my guide, my mentor, a friend, a God Father....
Doctors are the face of God, I had only heard it, but experienced it too in last 9 months.
A super energetic doctor reflecting positive vibes, prescribing least medicines, motivating me to work out, treat myself, travel, enjoy life and the phase and take care of myself...  He cultivates healthy habits in his pregnant women and I loved his dialogue - 'i want my women to be hot moms, not fat moms'
I have a severe phobia of blood & pain and delivery is all about pain and blood. Neither myself nor my family ever thought that I could deliver naturally, but Dr Datar's confidence in natural delivery helped me accomplish the task.
We decided to deliver our baby in Bombay despite the odds of difficulty with support since our families do not live in bombay, only for Dr.Datar and he never disappointed us.
Throughout my pregnancy, he promoted natural delivery and motivated me to prepare for the marathon saying I can do it if I want to do it and I should not think about cesarean at all. He was always very transparent with his advise, and never gave a wrong one. 
He did what he promised, and all the Lamaze, diet control, exercises and positive mental strength helped me in delivering a  healthy baby naturally.
Cloud9 services are definitely appreciable and the other doctors and team are awesome as well.

All thanks to Dr.Datar and team (including Dr.Meghna, Dr.Piyush, Dr.Atrye and all the other Cloud9 staff)

In his first Consultation he asked about all my past history and he took  care of my minute to minute details. After the consultation of almost an Hour he asked me to do certain tests on 20th May 2018. And as under his guidance we have done as same as he asked me to do, after getting the test reports we went back to Dr Datar for his Review, and we came to know that reports were abnormal and I was suffering from life threatening dieses. When we came to know about that news we all were in depression. But Dr Datar gave us Hope that it can be Curable by Surgery. But as my health was not supporting me for the same, Dr Datar took Regular Follow up and kept Track of my body health and my situation both for a month, exactly after a month on 18th June I admitted in hospital for surgery and on the second day Dr Datar Operated me for my Dieses, after a week I have got discharge from the hospital and today I am totally fine and living a normal routine life just because of Dr Datar.
	Me and my family members were having too much fear during this period but Dr Datar took care of it and helped me with coming out from this situation. He is not just my doctor, he is my guide, my mentor, a friend, Doctors are the face of God, I had only heard it, but experienced it too in the timing of my Treatment.  He is always very transparent with his advise, and never give a wrong advise to anyone. he always gives the proper time to his all the patients for all types of consultations, First visit itself me and my family were sure that we made a right decision. Every visit he would keep us in loop of everything that’s happening. He is happy to answer all your doubts, He answers all the queries, doesnt let you panic, comforts you in all the situations, while also informing you of all the pros and cons of every upcoming situation. He also listens to smallest and silliest of your concerns and helps you through  and the time of his visit for the indoor patients, I remember that every patient of him is waiting for his arrival and waiting to meet him, because he is always energetic and happy by anytime of his meeting, sometime you can feel that once if you meet Dr Datar you don’t need to take medicines, you will be alright just after having a friendly meet & word with him. I am happy with Dr Datar’s friendliness.

After a horrific experience of premature infant death in 2020, I had developed fear of getting pregnant again and lost hope of being a mother. However I got over the incident and decided to take a brave step of trying for a baby. I decided to consult a doctor in cloudnine malad to seek opinion on the way forward. Based on reviews, I chose Dr. Nikhil Datar. I consulted Dr.Datar in November 2021, and after meeting him gained confidence and hope that I could get pregnant. I conceived in June 2022 and chose Dr.Datar to be my doctor. He took all precautions from day 1 and ensured that I would deliver a full term baby. I trusted Dr.Datar , my body and I sailed through the 9 months smoothly. His words during check-ups - ""Yes, tell me"", ""everything is fantastic"", ""Your doing great"" etc, itself were so comforting and would boost my confidence. We were blessed with a healthy baby boy early March 2023.

As baby was born in 26 weeks so he had multiple complication and could only survive for 23 days in NICU unit of Cloudnine.

I got referred to Dr. Nikhil Datar through common friends and after ignoring my uterine fibroids condition for almost 3 years I went for a routine check up first time to Dr. Nikhil. Just on physical examination doctor told me that my uterine fibroids have grown quiet a bit and asked me not to delay and get an ultrasound done. 
I went for a USG immediately and the Sonologist confirmed that I need to treat these fibroids at the earliest as they were multiple, big in size and affecting other organs. 
For a person who’s never been hospitalised I was petrified however doctor made the whole process a cake walk. Not scaring me yet at the same time explaining me the gravity of the situation. 
It was luck and the good sense that prevailed upon me that time to come to Dr. Nikhil. He suggested an open myomectomy and due his expertise a surprise fibroid was found behind the uterus which wasn’t showing in the USG SCAN also and it was the largest in size of the 11 fibroids that were surgically removed. 
I shall be eternally thankful to Dr. Nikhil for getting me through this. It was only because of  my doctor that this journey was easy and stress free. 
Thanks a billion Doctor 🙏

And I naturally conceived the next time I visited him. I was gunning for a natural delivery and he supported me throughout. He would give us just the right guidance without being overbearing. His big smile and sense of humour always lightened up our mood. I particularly remember that despite a personal loss, he was smiling and taking all my queries patiently. He is just amazingly professional.

He was always very patient to answer all my queries and never rushed, no matter how many patients were lined up. Ladies, please do not hesitate to go to a male gynaec, especially Dr Datar! I would strongly recommend him. My entire journey (though only 3 months with him) was wonderful and I couldnt thank him enough for being such a wonderful doctor. I had a normal delivery and all thanks to him and also his assistant dr Meghna for being there throughout and making sure my baby and I were completely fine. He was more of a mentor than a doctor who makes you very comfortable from the time you visit him.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"""A male gynaecologist is not the preferred choice"". This social stigma is still prevalent and hence male gynaecologists have to face lots of troubles while treating their patients. I talk about this because I too had such stereotyping in me and I did think twice before visiting Dr. Nikhil Datar.
But let me also tell you that my baby was delivered by Dr. Nikhil and my wife is very happy about everything and both mom and baby are healthy.

I am here to help you stop thinking twice before meeting this Doctor (""Male Gynaecologist""). The very first time we met him, he talked through each and every details which made me and my wife very comfortable. Obviously, he brings in lots of experience in his field but before a good doctor he is a very good person which is evident from the very first meeting. I am really thankful that I met him and never thought again to take a second opinion.

There are changes that are physical and mental and if there is stress related to pregnancy it can cost you your baby.

When I came to Dr. Nikhil Datar first of all he studied my report and comforted me saying there are very less chances of test coming positive. He also asked me to go for NIPT test instead of Amniocentesis test as it is non invasive and not cause any harm to the baby. The report was normal. Dr’s right approach and jolly nature helped me get rid of the stress and enjoy my pregnancy.

If I say, I prefer male Dr.,or you can say I found myself more comfortable with the perticular ( Dr. Nikhil). 
Anyways, my journey started with Dr. in my 3rd month of pregnancy, when I switched my Dr. From___ to Dr. Nikhil Datar. I found him very very generous, very genuine and the most about him, his enthusiasm. You can say his experience to deal with different people makes him understand what you actually want from him which I thought his ' Smartness'.  Overall I can say he is my favourite  and the positive vibes comes from every appointment give you strength to push yourself ahead in your journey. The most I like is he always suggest you a positive side of problem. Whenever I asked about my lil lil exciting queries, he always responds in such a way, you get satisfied. The most imp. he never drive your thoughts in his own way, what I feel nowdays, docs do. And this is true in his conversation when I ask about 'to do' things for normal dilivery. He always says why not. As such, I have lot to write here, but let me complete my journey, and I ll be back soon. 

Till now I can only say, the Dr. is amazing. One can blindly follow him. I am associated with cloudnine only bcoz of him.
