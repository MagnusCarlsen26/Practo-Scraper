During my initial visit for a UTR, I shared my pregnancy reports with her, and she reassuringly said, 'Everything is good; you won't need any medication.' Her confidence and positivity boosted our morale. Within two months, I conceived!\\n\\nMy pregnancy was complicated, with a 5cm fibroid that grew to 10cm, and I faced severe vomiting issues, losing 7kgs in 7 months. But Dr. Saloni's constant motivation and encouragement kept me going. She ensured I stayed positive throughout, and her unwavering support helped me achieve a normal delivery, which I had almost given up on!\\n\\nWhat struck me most was her unique approach - she even recited the Hanuman Chalisa during my labor! Her emphasis on home remedies and minimal medication was remarkable. Dr. Saloni is an exceptional doctor who goes above and beyond, becoming a friend when needed. I feel grateful to have had her by my side.\\n\\nDelivering a healthy baby girl was a blessing, and I hope my daughter grows up to be like Dr. Saloni - compassionate, confident, and kind. 'Thank you' seems inadequate to express my gratitude. I love you, Dr. Saloni, for being an angel in disguise!\\",

If my sister/close friends get pregnant or need gynaecological consultation, I'd definitely recommend going to her and you should too!",

During my initial visit for a UTR, I shared my pregnancy reports with her, and she reassuringly said, 'Everything is good; you won't need any medication.' Her confidence and positivity boosted our morale. Within two months, I conceived!\\n\\nMy pregnancy was complicated, with a 5cm fibroid that grew to 10cm, and I faced severe vomiting issues, losing 7kgs in 7 months. But Dr. Saloni's constant motivation and encouragement kept me going. She ensured I stayed positive throughout, and her unwavering support helped me achieve a normal delivery, which I had almost given up on!\\n\\nWhat struck me most was her unique approach - she even recited the Hanuman Chalisa during my labor! Her emphasis on home remedies and minimal medication was remarkable. Dr. Saloni is an exceptional doctor who goes above and beyond, becoming a friend when needed. I feel grateful to have had her by my side.\\n\\nDelivering a healthy baby girl was a blessing, and I hope my daughter grows up to be like Dr. Saloni - compassionate, confident, and kind. 'Thank you' seems inadequate to express my gratitude. I love you, Dr. Saloni, for being an angel in disguise!\\",

                "review_text": "Hello all!\n\nYou are here reading this.\nso either you have been searching for where to go or you have finalised where to stick upon and want to be proud of your decission.\nBefore I say anything else, I would like to request you to sit back , take a deep breath and relax. You have reached your destination for this particular search.\n\n\nTo start with, We originally belong to Ahmedabad with entire bunch of relatives and pals located there. My husband possessing his where abouts of job here in Mumbai,\u00a0 we shifted here temporarily in our flat few months back , carrying a 4 months baby in my womb. All we knew here was that we were abdolutely alone.We were in a similar search and being constantly updated with excellency and merits of Dr Saloni Suchak ma'm , we zeroed in on the decission of consulting her for my pregnancy. \nThe first time we went to her clinic, I remember sitting in the corridor waiting for the appointment and glanced over a person walking by ; carrying simplicity , charming aura and positiveness wrapped in her personality! When our turn approached we found out that she was the person we were there for.\n\nIn the first instance itself, I was mesmerised with the consultation we had. An actual detailed and generous one.\nI enjoyed my pregnancy consultation like never before with huge bunch of knowledge and facts gained.\nThe aura that she carries makes you extremely comfortable and the deepest\u00a0 knowledge that she carries would make you enjoy your pregnancy even more with you wanting to rely on only and only her for all your problems and queries and situations.\n\nFew consultations went by and we were to shift back to our native place.\nOn the emerging day when we were to leave, we had our growth Scan and found out few complications. We were about to leave and we just tried making a little request to the hospital staff for wanting to meet Dr Saloni ma'm once before leaving. It was a day off for her consultation routine. To our surprise , on a very little request , she came down specially for meeting us giving so much of value to me as a patient and being there more as a wellwisher and guide.\n\nPertaining to the complications my pregnancy had , she had to take a tough decission of not allowing to send us back as travelling could worsen the things.We were totally taken aback with the density of the situation and almost were startled.On the very next moment we realised that we actually dint get a doctor but a well wisher , friend , relative and guide in the name of OUR DOCTOR. Amidst the busy streets of Mumbai, I believe we are among those 1 percent who are lucky enough to find a hand to hold on for all queries ranging from pregnancy to other essentials.\nShe was our one person contact for everything in Mumbai.\n\nHad it been any other professional, i would have delivered by baby right there prematurely. Instead , Saloni mam with her generous expertise *** **** ********* ** *** ******* made me pull 1 long month and deliver baby on the perfect time.\n\nThe best part about that one month long duration was that she was by our side each and every second.... and the fact that she was just a second away to communicate ,\u00a0 made us feel we were perfectly located in our home town.\n\nAlso, after the delivery too , she kept that hold on us and did not let us alone for a moment ... I remember texting her for my smallest queries and questions any time of day or night and she taking not more than a minute to reply back be it even mid night.\n\nOn delivering , i recollect my child's paediatrician noting down that Saloni mam has done an absolutely great job making me pull this long and that too delivering a baby with a good weight.\n\nWe would be going back soon with a smile on our face and a name in our heart forever... Saloni mam! \nMy kid says.... Saloni mam is that prayer through which i explored this world full of beautiful colors.. \n\n** **** * * ***** ** ********* * ****** *** a friendly persona is something we actually search for and Saloni ma'm is answer to all your questions !",

It was in those small moments of emotional connection that her true dedication shone through.And when the moment arrived, her presence was a beacon of strength. In the delivery room, amidst a whirlwind of emotions, her calm reassurance and quick thinking transformed what could have been overwhelming into a moment of shared triumph.Yet, what truly touched my heart was her unwavering availability.

It was in these instances that her commitment to ensuring all was well became palpable, turning potential moments of anxiety into opportunities for reassurance and trust.",

Minor but timely correction in my haemoglobin , weight & thyroid really helped. \n\nDuring my entire pregnancy journey Dr.Saloni was there for my like a rock. She would answer my calls & messages at any time of the day. I had a condition called \u201cPlacenta previa\u201d due to which I starting bleeding one night during my 35th week. This episode happened at around 12:30 in the night. Saloni answered my call in the first two rings and looking at my condition she asked me to rush to the hospitals. She reached the hospital before me and ensured that I am admitted  as an emergency delivery case as I was heavily bleeding. Her calm and composed natured gave a-lot of confidence to my Family as she ensured everything including the doctors team and the everything in the OT was in place. Within 45 minutes of reaching the hospital, I was blessed with a beautiful Baby Girl !! Both my and Baby were fit and fine- all Thanks to Saloni and her team. \nShe has a very infectious personality and I adore the way she balances both modern & traditional approach. Her dedication and promptness towards her profession is commendable. I simply Love her and want to Thank her for all that she has done for my and my little one. ",

She is thorough, detailed and patient; and she treats you like a person. \n\nI knew she would be the one when I had my first appointment with her. We began with a thorough history taking that covered family history, my personal history, the quirks of my body, and my general attitude towards life... all before she ever looked at my reports. I'm someone who favors a naturalistic approach, and she was 100% onboard with aspects of my care being handled without allopathic intervention. She never talked down to me, and she heard me out - all my concerns, all my questions... and we talked till I understood why my best option was surgery. \n\nEven when the course was set, Dr Saloni kept me looped into every decision. She took the time to explain the results of all my (SO many) tests. An hour before my surgery, we went through the surgical plan together, and she told me exactly what I could expect to feel coming out of the surgery.  Her surgical team was absolutely brilliant - the anaesthesiologist sent me into sleepyland laughing: she had cracked a joke and I was laughing as she placed the mask over my face. :) \n\nThe next thing I remembered was being in my room, post op, after Dr Suchak had removed 1.2kgs of fibroids from my body, plus my uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes. Suchak hospital is geared towards patient health (one of the few in Mumbai) and everyone from the nurses to the canteen staff to the doctors are steeped in a culture of care. My two main nurses (Jayshree and Alia) were clearly born to be nurses. I don't think I could've taken that first walk (or the many that followed), if it hadn't been for these two women. \n\nDr Saloni Suchak and I talked everyday in hospital, and she helped me chart the course of how my body would likely progress. I felt like a warrior, walking out of the hospital after a 3 day stay, on my own two feet, after such a massive surgery. \n\nI'm still waiting for the histo-pathology reports to come back, but should I need further treatment, I know I'm in the right hands with Dr Saloni Suchak. \n\nHighly, highly recommended.

When I first visited Dr.Saloni to confirm the pregnancy, all was not looking good on the reports, but Doc assured me to be stress free and gave me medications to sustain the same. She was my ray of hope. N indeed she proved to be my saviour. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I knew I was in safe hands from day 1. \nIn 2016, when I visited her for a normal gynac check up, she just touched my tummy, n asked me why did I ever go thru pains of IUIs n IVFs when everything in my uterus was so normal. She said, \"nothing's wrong with you, everything is normal.  Don't stress, if it has to happen it will\". N guess what eventually it did. My faith in her only increased by the day. She is a pure soul. N it only reflects in the way she treats her patients. She was there for me round the clock. I could ping her anytime and she responded immediately. Making me a lil less worried and tensed about what's going to happen next. Cause I knew , doc would never let anything wrong happen to me or my baby.She has magical hands. *** **** ******* * **** **** **** ******* And I am going to keep bothering her throughout my life. Rest assured.\nVery accommodating, very comforting, very patient, very kind ,very practical and very assuring. \n\nSo anyone who is looking forward to be treated by Dr.Saloni Suchak, trust me, you are in safe hands!!\n\nThanks Doctor !

I knew that I wouldn't start baby planning without proper due diligence and research of a good gynaec and hospital (Yes, I am one of those maniac googlers). Met many doctors who didn't match the long criteria I had in terms of attitude, wavelength, method and approach. And then, I found Dr. Saloni Suchak. Call her my lucky charm or good guide, I conceived within a month of consulting her. \nAs my anxious journey began, she guided, kept track, scolded and pacified me like no other doctor would. I think, at some point I forgot that she was/is my gynaec and not a friend! I probably had one of the smoothest and easiest pregnancies which I owe to her and my husband. However, my delivery didn't turn out to be as all of us had anticipated. We all could swear that I would have a vaginal birth and call it a day. But due to some last minute bodily complications, I had to go through C-sec. Had it not been for Dr. Saloni, I don't think I would've recovered or gone through with the surgery with so much ease, especially because it was my first time in a hospital, let alone surgery! \nAll in all, my experience with Dr. Saloni was so good that I'd want to go through this again and maybe again only if I know she'll be my doc again. (Haha, not sure she will be happy about this statement!!) I have recommended her to all my wanna be mom- friends. \nPS: I literally miss her post my delivery. \nThank you so much Dr. Saloni for bearing with me and giving me a smooth ride. ",

She was on my mind for her friendliness from the time I had visited her with my mom on recommendation of her doctor.\nWithin 2 appointments she was able to correctly diagnose the cause of my frequent UTI and boils which my previous doctor couldn't post which touchwood I haven't dealt with a UTI. She helped me plan my pregnancy and though I got pregnant earlier then decided throughout my pregnancy journey she has been a very big support, she was just a call away and never got annoyed when asked too many questions. Every appointment she patiently gave enough time to me and answered all my questions cleared all my doubts and guided me so well to a point where I was confident that everything's going to be fine as long as she was the doctor treating me. A high risk pregnancy with gestational diabetes and 2 loops of umblical cord around the neck from the 28th week of pregnancy she was extremely supportive.\nI haven't seen or heard of such a proactive doctor who would message me and ask for an update if she didn't hear from me. She encouraged me to even get vaccinated for COVID and i am so thankful to her for that.\nDelivering immediately after 37 weeks in the 9th month Dr Saloni ensured that we don't take any risk by stretching the pregnancy and at the same time that we don't deliver pre-maturely which was a brilliant decision from her side and we didn't question it because that's the kind of trust we had on her which she had gained from us.  my baby needed NICU care which was diagnosed by her and the pediatrician Dr Anup and they ensured everything was done at the right time and saved my baby for which I will forever be grateful to her and Dr Anup.\nShe is also not the kind of doctor who will frequently ask you to visit her unnecessarily.\nShe is the most polite and friendly doctor i have ever come across in my life and i feel we were blessed that she was my gynac. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude18",

                "review_text": "I am 39 yrs old and had Endometriosis for 10+ years and i had multiple Gynae's i had visited and i was operated theice already 2012-2014-2016 ( in 2016 i jad to remove my left ovary due to this disease) I finally met doctor Saloni Suchak in 2017/2018 whne i started visiting her regularly for my pain issues duringn and before my cycles every month. I was also taking Injections to skip my cycles and allow my body to recover/rest from the monthly cycles and pain.  Dr. Saloni has helped me at every step in the past few years to pvercome all what i was going through( it has been a nighmare which lasted for very long woth the monthly pain, cramps, backaches etc). In Aug 2021 i had visited her as my cycle wasnt stopping at all and again in Septhe same thing so basically i was bleeding all throughtout two months, doctor suggested me to post to do some blood tests and MRI/CTscan.  The report wasnt good my uterus was damaged so was my right ovary. Dr. Saloni explained me the whole process in detail for Hysterectomy and Oophorectomy, pre and post surgery do's and dont's and also gave me an option that i could go along the same way for a few more months with the help of meds, injections etc but i was convinced that since i have to get the surgery done o might as well go for it and i had and have full faith in Dr. Saloni that she will take care of everything for me which she did.  She is like a friend to me than a doctor. She is guiding me even today on how tobtake care, things i should he doing and / or not be doing post surgery.  She supports and am sure will continue to support me with all my ongoing issues like moods swings, heat flashes, any pain etc.  I would recommend anybody who is looking for a Gynae not only in Mumbai but even people from other places shouod visit Dr. Saloni Suchak as the way she handles her patients is outstanding(i had lot of Gynae's i had met but she is by far the best).  Thank you doc once again for every help you have offered.  God bless you in abundance!!\n",

I met her only thrice for my pregnancy-related issues, and after that I came back to my hometown in my first trimester due to COVID. She helped me find a gynaecologist in my hometown through her personal contacts. It was surprising for me because I was not expecting such kind of responsibility from a doctor whom you've only met thrice. After that she kept guiding me throughout my pregnancy without charging anything. She is my saviour, someone who held my hand like an elder sister through my pregnancy-related complications. She helped me find a hospital in Delhi, too, because at the last moment, when docs in my hometown told me that they wouldn't be able to save the baby, I lost all hope; but It was Dr Saloni who guided me through the crisis and told me to keep faith. Because I had no time in my hand\u2014and I couldn\u2019t fly back to Mumbai\u2014she told me to go to Delhi instead of going back to Mumbai to save time.\n\n        I delivered my baby girl during my 29th week in Delhi who had to stay in the NICU for three months.... but we both survived the crisis and are doing fine.\n\n        I can never thank her enough for what she did for me and my baby. She stood by me like a rock throughout my pregnancy and delivery.  Though she was not physically present with me but gave me so much strength emotionally to endure the crisis. She is an incredible person and I am truly blessed that she has touched my life. May she reach great heights in her life. \n\n        She will always be in my heart. \n",

Now even I vouch for her :) Dr. Saloni is really nice.. a great doctor and an awesome person. I trust her the most, not just for myself but even for my baby. I know she will do the best for us!! You hardly come across such doctors who care for your well-being so much during the course and even after! *** ** *** ***** We (me and my husband) are so blessed to have her in our lives.\n\nI reached out to her for my first pregnancy. Had a couple of issues - (gestational diabetes, thyroid).. she handled the journey so beautifully. She made me super comfortable. Just in couple of visits, I knew I was in safe hands. \n\nMy baby was born in April end amidst all the corona scare. She was the most understanding, reachable and supportive doctor, I have ever come across. What I loved was, she reaches out to you even before you do,  to ensure your well-being. Just before the lockdown, she called me and asked to come for a quick check up (35 weeks pregnant) as later it would be difficult. Throughout she proactively checked on me to ensure my well-being and continues to do it even today after my baby is 3 months old. She was always reachable and I was very confident that she is just a call away and incase of anything she will take care of it. \n\nMy delivery was also smooth.. she encouraged me for a normal delivery and because of her I had confidence to go thru it and is blessed with a healthy baby girl. \n\nOn the fifth day of birth, my baby looked quite yellow. It was a Saturday evening. We reached out to the peadiatrician, no response. We were worried and reached out to Dr. Saloni. She asked us to come to her hospital (we had the delivery in another clinic) and she will have peadiatrician on call check her on Sunday. My baby had extremely high bilirubin levels and had to be hospitalised immediately. Thanks to Dr. Saloni, my baby was treated immediately. If my baby was not checked then, it would have got very complicated. It scares me to even think about that. We will forever be grateful to her for that!! Always!! You hardly come across doctors who care for you so much!\n\nThank you so much Dr. Saloni!! We are blessed :)",

She was extremely warm, friendly and helped us in detail with all our doubts and in the very first we were sure that we wanted to have our baby under her guidance. In a month's time we conceived and my entire 9 months of pregnancy went off really smoothly, all thanks to Dr. Saloni. She is the only Dr I have interacted with who has been available 24/7 and responds literally in a few minutes. She has been like a friend answering each and every query of mine and never made me feel at ease always. \nMy delivery happened in June 2020 bang in between Covid-19 and despite the tough times Dr. Saloni continues to serve all her patients 24/7 and with this dedication. I have witnessed her dedication towards her patients first hand and I can only say that very few doctors in today's day practise like her. I had to change my choice of hospital for delivery in the very last minute due to corona and again Dr. Saloni played a very important part in helping me and giving me comfort for such a last minute change.\nOn the actual day of delivery she was there by my side throughout and kept talking to just like a friend would which made it so much easier to have a normal vaginal delivery. \nIve had the best pregnancy and delivery experience all thanks to her. I'm almost going to miss having my visits with her.\nThanks Dr. :-)",

When we embarked on this journey, we started looking out for a gynaecologist ologist who was a combination of a good doctor, a patient listener and a friend. After doing our research, we zeroed upon Dr. Saloni Suchak who exactly fitted in our framework.\n\nIn my case, the pregnancy journey has been very smooth with Dr. Saloni. She did not prescibe any unnecessary medicines or tests and whatever medicines she prescribed, she logically and medically explained their importance to the body. \n\nRight from the conception of pregnancy to the post delivery care, she has been just stupendous! She is a highly affable doctor who carries that extra human touch, which is of an utmost need by any pregnant lady. She listens to all the doubts with full patience and clarifies them in the best possible way. She is highly accessible even during her holidays, and revert at the earliest which indeed makes her a notch more special doctor! \n\nDuring my pregnancy, once, I had extreme fever and mild herpes infection. In both the instances, she diligently handled the situation, made me connect to the physician and skin specialist. Further, she made that extra effort to monitor the progress routinely, and ensured that there was no harm to the foetus. \n\nEven during the last month of pregnancy, when everything was going smooth, and I was expecting a normal delivery. We were bit taken aback by the fact that baby's head was floating even in 39th week. The situation remained same till 40th week and I crossed my due date. Then a cesarean delivery remained the only plausible option. I was highly petrified of the C section. Once again Dr. Saloni logically convinced me and my family for the same. The cesarean delivery was scheduled and she made me deliver my baby in a perfect healthy condition. \n\nShe delivered her best even during the post operative care and made me feel comfortable in the best possible way.\n\nTo summarize, indeed Dr. Saloni Suchak is a doctor who has *** **** **** ******* **** **** ******* ****** *** **** **** a caring and healing touch. I highly recommend her for all the pregnancy related health issues.",

Somehow she is the perfect combination of a young and experienced doctor. \n\nWe were made very comfortable and she patiently handled all our questions. Her diagnosis, follow ups and medication was impeccable before delivery.\n\nMy wife had to undergo an emergency early term delivery on a holiday. We frantically called her at 4:30 am and she answered the call in one ring and gave us clear instructions.\n\nThat's the comfort you seek from a doctor. She ensured that she was available on the same day for the delivery and took a well calculated decision of going for a normal delivery. She was very composed which made us really comfortable.\n\nBeing early term our kid needed some more time at the hospital. While technically her job as a gynecologist ends with delivery and follow up, she kept checking with us on the health of our kid and was kind enough to talk to the pediatrician too which really helped.\n\nWell,if I may say, We met her as a doctor and ended up being like friends.\n\nPS: At the hospital, I met another father who said they finally chose Dr. Saloni to handle their high risk case after their initial experience with two other gynecologists didn't go very well! By then I already knew we had made the best decision.\n\nThank you doctor for all the support!\n",

Her quick wits and incredible decision-making skills weren't just professional traits; they were threads weaving a safety net around my journey into motherhood.In the late-night talks about concerns and the shared laughter during appointments, Dr. Suchak brought a warmth that went beyond the clinical setting. It was in those small moments of emotional connection that her true dedication shone through.And when the moment arrived, her presence was a beacon of strength. In the delivery room, amidst a whirlwind of emotions, her calm reassurance and quick thinking transformed what could have been overwhelming into a moment of shared triumph.Yet, what truly touched my heart was her unwavering availability.

Her humanity, blended with professional expertise, turned the journey into not just a medical experience, but a tapestry of shared emotions, trust, and the indescribable joy of new life.During moments of worry and uncertainty, Dr. Saloni Suchak exhibited a level of compassion that went beyond the routine. When I expressed concerns, her empathetic ear listened intently, never dismissing any worry as insignificant. Instead, she approached each concern with a highly analytical mindset, delving into details and providing explanations that not only addressed my fears but also empowered me with understanding.I recall a particular incident where a seemingly minor symptom sparked anxiety. Dr. Suchak not only took the time to thoroughly investigate but also explained the intricacies, soothing my concerns with both her medical expertise and genuine care. It was in these instances that her commitment to ensuring all was well became palpable, turning potential moments of anxiety into opportunities for reassurance and trust.This is type of doctor one would need in every step of pregnancy.

At the same time, she is very cautious too \u2013 it paid well to listen to all her advice, else I would have gotten into deep trouble during my delivery. It seems that she really enjoys her work and money is secondary to her. She didn\u2019t bother to charge me for a procedure (which she had every right to charge for). Even after a month post the delivery, she was so excited to see me. She is very qualified and successfully carried out the delivery of my friend\u2019s baby despite the very complicated nature of the surgery (every other doctor in Mumbai, whom my friend visited, refused to take her case). So, I naturally felt very, very safe with her all throughout. I loved her so much that I decided not to pursue consultation at one other well-qualified hospital near my parents\u2019 house (where my first baby was born) even though my insurance covered the entire expense in the hospital as opposed to part of the expense at Dr. Saloni\u2019s. It\u2019s worth it to mention that my experience at the nursing home of Dr. Nanavati (where I delivered) was really amazing too \u2013 they would constantly check on me and used to take care of the baby completely while I got time to recover (no wonder I started walking a day sooner post-delivery). There is a reason why there is such a huge fan following of her and everyone who has consulted her raves about her. She is such a wholesome person. I highly recommend at least initiating consultation with her. In all likelihood, you will not like to consult another doctor thereafter. (P.S.: a lot of these experiences are in comparison to my experiences during the delivery of my first baby, which was quite good in itself \u2013 so it says a lot about her)",

She is Very understanding and listens to your concerns broad-mindedly and rather than making patients panicking into problems,  she always make them relaxed and focus more on solutions and positive results with friendly attitude. \n\nIn our case, we had Pre-pregnancy consultation and we came to know, that I was having High BP and few other challenges as well like Fibroids. But she treated that with proper planning and without any major treatment now we are blessed with a Cute Baby Girl. In this entire process and even after my delivery Dr. Saloni was always there as a great support everytime. She was always available by managing her busy schedule.\n\nShe takes time with the patient to help them to come up with positive result and very important that she gives the medication only and only if it's necessary...!! \n\nMe and my Husband, We highly recommend her to anyone looking for a friend who is a Gynac Specialist.",

She is the most genuine doctor I have ever met.\nMy entire pregnancy went smoothly. However due to some last minute complication during delivery I ended up with a C section. Dr Saloni immediately recognised the signs of fetal distress and due to her quick decision I delivered a healthy baby boy. My recovery post the operation has been smooth as well. \nYou are awesome Dr Saloni. Thank you so much and I love you. :)\nI also have to say here that the team at Benzer Nursing home is great. Keep up the good work. ",

My entire journey of pregnancy has been so smooth since she was always there to answer all my doubts . She is the one who will answer your queries through whats app also. There is everything positive about her. Her behavior and attitude reflects how much passionate she is about her profession which makes her a wonderful doctor. She is always upfront to follow up on your health. Even when she is not in town she will regularly follow up through whats app and call. There are so many good experiences all of which are difficult to be penned down here. You are just setting a great example for other doctors to follow. I am sure people would not be tensed to be admitted to hospitals if doctors like you exist. All the best for a great career.",

I first met Dr. Saloni Suchak at Namaha Healthcare where she is a consulting Gynaecologist and Obstetrician. She came across as a very spirited and kind doctor who took utmost care and advised me throughout my pregnancy from the beginning. There is a certain aura around her that brings positivity and trust in you when you meet her. She makes you feel so much at ease when you are in her care. Her patience and approachability helped me a lot especially during my inital days of pregnancy. Her dedication and commitment towards the well being of her patients is difficult to match with anyone. Thanks to her I could have a normal delivery although it looked a bit difficult in the end. *** ****** ** ** ****** *** true professional who I look up to with respect and gratitude not only as my child was born off her hands but also because of the beautiful being she is. \n",

I was taking all pregnancy care from Kokilaben hospital, but when i met Dr. Saloni i changed my mind and i think that was the best decision i made that time. i was very worried regarding my labor pain and C sec, but she was always in touch with him, whole two months. I never seen any other Dr who respond on whatsapp. this kind of support helped me to come out of my fear and at the end i had C sec.\r\nBecause of her i am a proud mother of baby boy... Next time when i will see any pregnant women i will surly tell her about Dr. Saloni doesn't matter i know her or not heheh. sometimes we need more mental support rather then physical and she is complete package. she is expert in taking care, making comfortable,and o fcourse in her job as a Gynecologist. and yes my delivery was done at Suchak Hospital not at Cloud nine. Doctor u r best. wish you all the best for the rest. for me you are my real life hero. thanks for everything..... \r\n\r\nOne Special  thing which touched my heart was giving me Guruduwara ka Kada prasad... thanks doc i never met a doctor like you... \r\nYou set an example for others keep going........ Love you...\r\nThanks a lot to entire Suchak hospital \r\n   ",

If you are the first time parents like us you might have a lot of questions, would need hand holding at certain stages and Mam just excels at all that. She has a very friendly nature and would calm you down at certain stages when it's required. Overall she prepares you for the final stages and keeps on updating you on a regular basis what steps you can take to have a smooth pregnancy and delivery later on. She will listen to you patiently and even laugh with you on the myths passed by society from generations to generations. We ran into a bit of complications in the later stages and the way she explained us, no words can describe that emotional moments. We were a bit scared for C-Sec but she made it looked easy and stress free and today both me and my baby are healthy. I would surely recommend her. All the best and enjoy this phase of your life !!",

Doc is very chill and friendly, and this certainly helps you ease and discuss all issues freely.

Her cheerful demeanor and positivity encourages you to have full faith in her and she does solve everything with much ease. At 5 weeks pregnancy we had to travel to Gurgaon and had to do ultrasound there to check the baby\u2019s heartbeat however to our dismay heartbeat was not heard. The doc in Gurgaon created much panic, however when we came back to Mumbai and consulted saloni doc she asked us to relax and do the scan in 2 weeks again as the interval was not correct- and yes we heard the heart beat! \nWith time we feel as if Doc is like our family and she genuinely cares for my wife- constantly cheering her up. We feel really lucky to have found such a brilliant Doc and will follow her line of treatment completely as \n we welcome our new member in September\u2019 22.",

We visited her for opinion as we were trying to conceive, which turned out to be our best decision. In the very first visit, she made me so comfortable that I knew I was in safe hands. She guided us  for the best treatment and had been with us throughout the journey to get our little angel into this world safely. \n\nShe is very professional yet very friendly, caring, kind and understanding which is very rare these days.  She explains everything in detail and listens very patiently, she gives enough time during each visit. Mine was high risk pregnancy and she handled it so well by being on my side since beginning and by being proactive.  During my last month she was in constant touch with me  as I had got bp issue, which reduced my stress. I  had to undergo c-section, for which  she was very supportive during and even after the surgery..Best thing about Dr saloni is she is always reachable  and she replies within minutes  which is highly appreciated.\n\n I am honestly short of words to describe how excellent dr and amazing person she is. I feel blessed and lucky to have found her and would recommend her to anyone without a second thought, trust me it is very difficult to find a doctor like her. Thank you so much Dr for all your support. \n",

During my first visit only she made me so comfortable and her friendly treatment made me sure that I have made the right choice. And well it turned out to be true as she made sure that I have a normal vaginal delivery. She went two steps ahead to put in everything she can to make sure that I have NVD. I just can't imagine without her would it have been really possible to have such a great experience and a normal delivery. Words are less to express my gratitude and hats off to her that even in such testing times of Covid-19 pandemic and working too hard and shuttling between hospitals to make up for the quarantined medical staff, she's been 24*7 available for her patients. Beyond commendable. Also, while my entire pregnancy period, she never even once suggested any unnecessary test, medicines or injections which these days usually many practitioners do. Best was she always asked to do things naturally rather than treating them medically which is rare these days. **** *** *** **** ******* I am indebted to you for life for helping us bring a new life safely to this world in this difficult situation.

The surgery, pre and post operative care was brilliant. \nI'm usually a nervous wreck before invasive procedures, but under her guidance, the confidence she displays and the trust one can put In her, I went in with zero anxiety! I was so calm I surprised myself... but I could do that because I had a kind, confident and trustworthy Doctor! \n\nI have seen several gynaecs before her, but none have had such empathy, calmness and the willingness to explain medical terms in the simplest way that she does. \nHer personality makes you feel warm, hopeful and so good when you leave her clinic. Her positive attitude is infectious, and I think, that for me, is half the battle won already! \nIf you believe in prayer, then you must know I prayed hard before I went searching online for a Good gynaecologist! Dr. Saloni is that brilliantly answered prayer!",

Take my words I\u2019ve went under her hands treating my fibroid (10.5 cms.) through laparoscopy. Trust me before meeting Dr. Saloni, the suggested treatments by couple of other Doctors for the size of my fibroid sent chills down my spine and I use to get sleepless nights worrying about it, but she worked around the whole thing like a charm having a complete grip over every situation at any given time. With her expect no highly coloured reports or confusing terminologies she\u2019ll be upfront and honest. She makes herself available for her patients every time required for, if she\u2019s not around she\u2019ll make sure some how someone will attend you, if not she will personally guide you with a solution. She was a breath of fresh air every time I met her in my due course of the surgery.\nTo put it\u2019ll in a jist she\u2019s is smart, she\u2019s quick, she\u2019s super alert and she\u2019s very very sweet. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nThanks Doctor for all and most importantly thank you for keeping the HOPE alive and getting me through \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2695",

She only asked for test to be done when required and explained why the test were required. She was always available and accessible and she took her time during visits answering all my questions and doubts. Even when she was not in Bombay and I was unwell she made sure to recommend another Doctor and she also kept checking with me about my health. During the 29th week of my pregnancy it was diagnosed that there was less amniotic fluid. Due to Dr. Saloni Suchak expertise she pushed the pregnancy till 36 weeks and I was blessed with a healthy baby girl. She was calm and presented all the possible outcomes and the solutions and she prepared us for everything without getting us worried or scared. During this times she always checked up on me. When the time came for my emergency delivery she was prepared and within an hour my baby girl was delivered. I would highly highly recommend her. ",

To start with we didn't know many people in Mumbai and it was really difficult for us to find the right doctor, but after doing a little bit of online research  and with help of few aquintances we zeroed in on Dr Saloni and let me tell u I consider that the best decision of my life. After my very first consultation I knew I had made the right decision for myself and my to be born baby. Dr Saloni's cheerful, friendly and optimistic nature gave me the strength and hope that I needed at that moment. The way she explains  and answers all your queries gives you the sense that she really cares for you. It felt like being in the company of a true friend. Five Months into my pregnancy my husband got transferred  and unfortunately we had to move out of Mumbai. I was really sad at the prospect of having to go to a new doctor. But  Even when I moved out of Mumbai , Dr Saloni kept in constant touch with me, enquiring about my well being and providing her valuable feedback and suggestions which helped me immensely through the rest of my pregnancy period *** *** ********* ****** ** **** ******* ** ***** ***** ** ** ********** Today I am a happy mother and I thank Dr Saloni for that.I would recommend Dr Saloni to all the to be Mom's. she is one stop destination for all your pregnancy related needs.",

The doctor after thorough check - up and tests told me about some Gynecological problem and referred me to the Dr. Saloni Suchak. I was suffering from Gynae problem from many years and had consulted many doctors all these years but after meeting Dr. Saloni Suchak I can assure you that she is very well versed in her trade. She is the one who diagnosed my actual problem and prescribed me the related medicine. She is one of her kind who suggest her patient to avoid surgery and treat them with medicine first. Surgery should be the option is her mantra. She is very affable and makes you feel at home and she even now has been in touch whenever I have asked for my disease through WhatsApp. I also like to thank Dr. Suraj Suchak who is not only excellent urologist but also a great human being. Thanks.   ",

She is full of positive energy and such a charming personality. One thing you feel every time you visit her that she is an expert in her field and she loves her job. One of the highlights of her that she pays personal attention to her patients. In my late pregnancy weeks I used to get regular messages from her enquiring about my health except my weekly visits to her. \nDr.Saloni creates comfort zone from 1st visit which allows to ask any query without hesitation. She is never tired of answering my long list of questions in every visit, which helped me be informed & aware of my health and my baby's progress throughout 9 months. \nMe along with my husband are so happy and satisfied that we chose  Dr. Saloni to be our partner in bringing our little bundle of joy in this world. \nI am and will always reccomend Dr. Saloni to everyone who seek gynaecologist and obstetrician.",

She understands very well the latest options associated with positive, happy births such as hypnobirthing, breathing techniques, prenatal exercises, water births, doula support etc, which she kept guiding me on throughout. Will be recommending her to everyone! ",

Being 30+, i was very anxious since this was my first pregnancy and was looking for an old lady with good amount of experience to tackle if any complications to be. To my surprise Dr. Saloni Suchak turned out to be young. After my first visit all my apprehensions disappeared. She was extremely welcoming. My first impression of her was she is a friendly, calm, well poised and a very professional doctor. She really listens and in doing so makes sure your treatment isn't just what would generally be best for everyone, but best for you. I came out of the visit and was extremely happy that finally we found the right doctor. There was no other doubts thereafter. \n\nShe was always available on whats app and a call away. Replied all my queries be it silly, small or big. Her approachability throughout the pregnancy always ensured me n my baby were in save hands\n\nI had read so many articles, about different methods of delivery, attended sessions, referred to youtube about what happens in Labor and what to do. All this came very little in handy ,Trust me when the time comes you need a very good obstetricain who gives constant support in labor room. She was there through out the night till my baby arrived in this world safely. i had a normal delivery and was blessed to have Dr Saloni by my side. i was absolutely blown away by the quality of care that Dr Saloni provided. i could not have been in better hands on the day our baby came into the world. Would highly recommend her",

She is god's gift to mankind...truly!\n\nAfter spending numerous hours on internet and visiting three doctors during the pre and initial stage of  pregnancy, luckily my stars and practo helped me find Dr Saloni. The first meeting with her, me and dear hubby unanimously agreed that she will be the one to help us bring our lil bundle of joy to this world.  She is very charismatic and great at what she does, one can't leave her chamber unimpressed and unsatisfied.\nThus started my journey to motherhood under her guidance. She was there for me like a  doc, a friend & a guide whenever i needed her...I came up with numerous questions and she would listen, answer and explain patiently till every iota of doubt was cleared from my mind , i never saw a smirk or twitch  on her face for all my trivial questions. She explained assured, re-assured with utmost patience and the infectious smile of hers :)\nDuring the last month of my pregnancy I use to get constant messages form her checking on me and my lil one..number of kicks ,movement & my well being. I might forget to update her at times but she never forgot to check on me ( hard to believe....i know!!)\nI had a smooth delivery & recovery under her.\nDuring the journey she became a friend and that helped me stay at ease for the complete time.\nWords are not enough to show my gratitude for her....she is amazingly well at what she does and is a wonderful person  ,  i miss her and her infectious positivity around me :)\nThanks Dr. Saloni...you are the best!\n\nSo all you \"going to be Or planning MOMS\" just trust all the reviews and go meet her for your pregnancy, she will make that whole roller coaster ride a smooth sail for you! All the best!\n",

I really can't thank her enough for all she did for us. I feel so fortunate to find her :). She always explains the problem in detail which most Dr.s do not do. She has this amazing quality of remembering all the tiny details about her patients. Undoubtedly she is the best. I would highly recommend her.",

For the 1st time I felt less like I was visiting a Dr. and more like seeing a long lost friend. Right from her physical appearance to her welcoming nature and most importantly her openness in discussing my case was something that struck me and immediately made me realise that I had made a right choice at the right time. Since then till my delivery we met on several occasions and she didn\u2019t change one bit or was never any less considerate or off colour even after a long tiring surgery or 2. Her guidance and calming approach prior and during my delivery made decision making very smooth for me and my family. All and all I would say that I went to find a good Dr. for myself and in-return found the best one, a great friend and an inspiring aunty for my daughter.  ",

In fact even after my pregnancy she was available for me when ever I needed her which is a further testament to client centricity and how caring she is towards her patients. I would highly highly recommend her . ",

She was available over the phone call as and when it was required. Finally on the day of delivery my experience with her was beautiful. During entire labor pains she stood by and kept motivating me. I cannot forget the love and affection she showed towards me during those hours. I would really recommend her and I am so grateful to the Creator that my child and I were under right hands. In future if I think to plan my 2nd child it will be under her guidance only.",

After I was done with the surgery which was successfully performed by her she came in and complimented me about how brave I am as this was my first ever surgery experience in life. I had never had a surgery done before. I was very scared & nervous however whenever I used to look at Dr. Saloni I would manage to gather all my courage. It is very important to trust your doctor & I can say that Dr. Saloni has gained my trust with her confidence in what she does and her positive attitude & knowledge.",

She is very calm, patient and available round the clock. She is prompt and her response is at lightning speed which always amazes me how she manages her time.\nShe is extremely passionate and ethical, she makes it a point to explain things in detail so you are well aware and always makes sure you are comfortable.\nDuring my last few weeks of pregnancy she showed great concern and followed up proactively on my health.\nThe best thing about her is she encourages normal delivery and strives for it, which I have personally experienced in both my deliveries which had been normal.\nSo if you are consulting with Dr Saloni, be rest assured you are in good hands and I highly recommend her.",

Being first time parents we were very concerned and careful about our choice of doctor. We wanted someone who would guide us with compassion, empathy and common sense rather than overwhelm us with medical paraphernalia. We were very lucky to find Dr. Saloni via Practo. She is unlike many doctors I have met and takes personal interest in her patients without being intrusive. She was always available whether on call or messenger to address any concern no matter how trivial. This was very important to us as I am a working professional and had heard horrified tales of long queues, and appointment times from friends & famiy. Dr. Saloni's positivity, compassionate care and guidance helped me in having a comfortable pregnancy, and a normal delivery. I would strongly recommend her.",

The way i have been treated i m sure no one else could do. she is so friendly in nature and gives confidence to her patient. She will proactively monitor the whole journey which made it easy for a women. That feeling is always with me that doctor is just a message away.I am really thankful to her that she made both my preganancies very easy. words are really less to explain how wonderful doctor you are. Thanks alot once again to you doctor.",

I used to look forward to her consultation coz her positive aura and friendliness makes you feel really good even during difficult times. The best part about her is she wouldn't unnecessarily call you for consultation and remain in touch with you through watts app. She promptly replies to your queries which is really important coz pregnancy journey is generally filled with loads of doubts.

Look no further if you need an Ob-Gyn who is not only supportive but encouraging beyond belief. Her proactiveness in resolving our queries and guiding us with the minutest details kept room for no doubts. She is ALWAYS available on messages to resolve any uncertainties if any which is highly appreciable. She pushed me for NVD right from the start and the entire treatment along with the suggested exercises helmed by her expertise helped me extensively. I am continuing my postnatal care under her guidance and my recovery has been great. We wish her all the best for her amazing work! ",

Dr Saloni is my angel send by God to me, from the first day of my consulting with her she made me very comfortable, she is like a friend to me. I had a huge fibroid which was operated by Dr Saloni, i had to undergo Laproscopy and small open surgery as the size of fibriod was huge, the entire process went smoothly and Dr Saloni removed the entire fibroid intact from my body which is commendable, on the day of surgery she made sure that my husband was getting all the information about whats going inside the OT, after surgery she was with me till i came to my concious, even the nursing staff ,helpdesk staff and all the other staffs  at Suchak hospital are excellent. There are many good doctor's but there are few doctor's who thinks first about thier patients, Dr Saloni you have a heart of gold and are the true meaning of what a doctor is supposed to be for the patient. Thank you for everything.",

We meet her at 6 weeks of my 1 st pregnancy, which we had to terminate via DNC due to medical reasons. However she was there with me guiding me for the next steps to be taken. For my next pregnancy also she was there with me to guide, motivate and give me assurance that things will fall in place. She is friendly, easily approcable, patient. She is just a whasapp text away for any small queries you have. Even all medical terms she helps in making us understand so that we are aware. She has played a major role in making my journey right from conception uptill delivery beautiful. Even post delivery she is there to guide and listen to us. I thank her a lot for bringing our Princess into this world. I just can't thank her enough. The best part about her is that she gives us a personal touch in every small conversation you make with her. Lots of love to her from our side \ud83d\udc96",

Even though i never met her and it was just an appointment for consultation still just on a phone call she helped me she used her reference and sources and gave the best possible way i could have been treated and sended me to hospital with her personal request that too in this crisis time of covid-19 where no hospital admits you without covid 19 reports. \nReally her help that too never meeting in person just on call just not as a doctor but as a human being too....she is immensely a very great person.. Today am fit and fine with a baby girl in my hand all because of her help. \nNever came across of such a doctor and person in my life! ",

She treated and cared my pregnancy very well( just note that I have a history of multiple miscarriages ) she was with us not like a doctor just like family\nWe cannot stop thanking her for the beautiful gift. \nJust a last thing - She is very decisive, responsive and dont let us think much. Best wishes for her. \n",

She is one person who broke all the moulds in our mind about how a doctor should be to patients. All through our journey, she was more like a family member who is always available and takes her patients with immaculate dedication and concern. Her methods to find natural solutions rather than merely prescribing medicines is something which is impossible to expect in these times from a doctor. I am not getting words to express my gratitude to her. Thank you for being a guardian angel to our little princesses' journey to this world. We will never forget and always will be thankful to things you have did for us. God bless you. ",

Through the entire journey - from diagnosis of the tubal rupture to surgery to post-surgery care, she has been rock solid and continues to guide me with utmost patience. She's always approachable, prompt for even the slightest of my queries and what I appreciate most about her is that she is extremely decisive, swift in her actions and yet extremely calm & warm - it's a rare combination among doctors these days. I feel blessed to have found her!! ",

We are very grateful to her. \n\nWe moved from Bangalore to Mumbai recently and after lot of research, we visited Dr. Saloni. That was best decision we made throughput my wife's pregnancy. \n\nDr. Saloni is wonderful human being and very dedicated doctor. She owns the problem her patients are facing and give full involvement. She gives personalised connect and attention to whatever we were trying to tell her. She was also reading all reports with full attention and interest. She was very friendly and it is always easy to communicate with her. \n\nMoney or fees are of least important to her and she is more concern about clinical outcomes. Wherever required she does not hesitate to take expert advice. \n\nOverall, We feel she is best choice with respect to all aspects and someone you can completely trust on. \n\nBest Regards,\nShirish Desai",

She changed our lives as individuals as she not only brought us out of the trauma that we were going thru coz of pregnancy issues but also made sure that we sail thru her treatment with a lot of ease and comfort... Never even for a instance we felt alone or lacked any guidance from her... She went out of her way to make sure that the procedure were followed and a genuine followup was made...\nEven after having to take a tough call on a ceserian vs normal delivery it feels now that the wisest call was taken, all thanks to Dr Saloni. \n\nDoctors like her are the reason happiness is possible to find. \n\nThank you sooooo much for making us complete and giving us the pleasure of parenthood. \n\nSurekha & Anil Shinde.

Her positive attitude goes beyond the typical doctor-patient relationship that even after 7 days of the surgery, she herself checked how I was. It was very heart touching.

During pregnancy, Dr Saloni gave me only the required medicines and instructions which highly relieved me mentally. \nTalking about Suchak hospital , it is one of the oldest and the best hospital in suburbs. Comfortable rooms, maximum amenities under the same roof and a courteous staff which looks after you day and night. \nHaving a calm and cheerful personality, thanks to Dr Saloni I am enjoying motherhood.

I treated her like my elder sister..\nBefore meeting her I already did CA 125 screening test and MRI,but I was worried as my both results were not correlating,she was the one with her great experience/practice who explained me the possible reason of high value and asked me to reevaluate/redo  CA 125.. So she was absolutely perfect with her decision and my new CA 125 value have reduced significantly (5times),she have put me out of all my worries and negative thoughts. \nConsidering my age she advised me that whatever best possible she will do it for me,she was well concerned about my health, it's almost one week from my surgery of ovarian cyst I'm totally fine and fit now.\nI will definitely prefer her for all my problems if arise in future and will recommend her too.",

She was always available on whatsapp and phone and used to followup for my health regularly on whatsapp.\nI had complications from 29th week of pregnancy. She gave best medication to ensure that I reach atleast 34 weeks so that baby's stay in NICU can be minimised.\nAs in suchak hospital NICU facility was not there she recommended to do C section in cloudnine as NICU facility is good.after delivery  she was constantly in touch with NICU doctor to ensure that baby comes out of NICU at the earliest. And my baby came out of NICU in 5 days.\nThanks Dr. Saloni.*** *** *** ****",

She answered all the questions asked to satisfy our concerns. After surgery Dr. Saloni Suchak made regular visits, did timely checkups, and guided us through the recovery process. The follow-up visit was also to our satisfaction. She kept us informed about the tests and results, and gave us the peace of mind throughout the entire process. She is a great communicator and an amazing doctor. I will definitely recommend Dr. Saloni Suchak to people in need of her services.",

We rushed to Suchak Hospital and she came and took control over the situation. We were scared that it will be a caesarean. Dr Saloni thought otherwise.\u00a0 She guided me to push and inspite the cord being around the child's head she managed a normal delivery. The best part was that she was as much happy as we were. She was excited and happy.\u00a0 We have never come across a doctor who made us feel as if we were family. I also want to mention about the sisters and staff of Suchak Hospital. They were so cooperative and friendly. \nThank you Suchak Hospital and Dr Saloni Suchak.",

She calmed me down and proper diagnoses of my pain was done. She suggested me laproscopy surgery and grafting the entire process for me till 12th December she was constantly available for me on call and message. A highly positive person in life approaches us to be positive too. Her words worked and complicated surgery went smooth with her.\nNot even a second thought. \nHighly appreciated. \nA life time relation built with her. Second life given by her. Always thankful. ",

I wasn't a straightforward case to handle, but she managed all my complications like a pro. Right from pre conception to post delivery she has been just amazing. The fact that she is accessible over a phone helped me to put all my worries to end. She personally kept track of my progress and health conditions regularly. The quality of care and level of support that Dr. Saloni provides is unmatched. She is an absolute angel.\n\nMy dream of motherhood has come true because of her and we are eternally grateful to her.",

The entire experience has been pleasant to say the least. From being available even at the weirdest of hours (including delivery post midnight 2), to ensuring that we are heard patiently - she has been very approachable. Her treatment methods, for any challenges one faces during pregnancy are not anecdotal, but logical. In case she doesnt hear from patients, she personally checks at regular intervals to ensure pregnancy is on track. Always smiling and jovial, we felt more like speaking to a friend who is helping us address our concerns. Thanks doc for making this a cherishable 9 months. We ended up hoping that our kiddo also has a paed who is as comfortable as her. Kudos to you doc. Keep smiling.",

Already I had lots of complications and hence wanted a very good and experienced doctor who can handle my High risk pregnancy. After going through lots of internet research, and meeting many Doctors ,we met Dr Saloni Suchak, and after meeting her we decided not to look else where. Her first meeting we will never forget. She assured us that we will try to stretch the delivery to 37-38 Weeks then we will not have the need forNICU , It was as if she had this sixth sense and I delivered in 37.4 weeks. She was always available at her hospital and also on phone and WhatsApp.Her first meeting itself gave us assurance that our unborn child is in safe hands.She didn't prescribe unnecessary medication and drugs and insisted more on home remedies.Her commitment towards my delivery and discharge was well planned and implemented inspite of her family function.",

She patiently listened to all my queries, howsoever silly they may be, and discussed every aspect in great detail. She is the most approachable and accessible doctor I have ever visited in my life, responding to all my calls and messages super promptly. She made my pregnancy journey a beautiful and memorable one. I can totally vouch for Dr. Saloni for all your gynaec problems and strongly recommend her. ",

She planned a proper treatment cycle for me and within a year i conceived... :)\n\nShe ensures you get the exact treatment you need, answers all your queries even on whatsapp and is extremely approachable. During my pregnancy i had to move out of Mumbai but she has been answering all my queries even now and she herself asked me to keep in touch with her. Who otherwise would do that :) Much thankful to her!!",

She had been like a friend throughout the pregnancy process explaining the details of each concern.My being a high risk pregnancy as was detected with short cervix and funneling, was able to hold baby really long and then delivered a healthy baby normally with no health complications due to her ********* treatment. The best part about consulting her was i was able to share my concerns and problems with her through messages. My delivery though a normal one had gone easy because of her. Thanks to the doctor and looking forward to be able to see her in future pregnancy as well.",
