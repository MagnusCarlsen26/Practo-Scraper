With all RESPECT & LOVE FROM BOTTOM OF MY HEART -

I and my father (ANIL GHAG)  would like to express my deepest gratitude for everything that you have done for my MOTHER during her CRITICAL HEALTH SITUATION treatment I never thought that I would see her smiling again after she faced critical pain and bleeding problem in past week . You gave me a glimpse of hope when you explained about the procedure and the post operation therapy to be conducted for her instead of her hemoglobin at 7Gm as it was very risky operation which you did with Nisha Krishnan  and your team in theatre. I thank you all humbly from bottom of my heart and wish you can put smile across infinite faces who come to you as a hope to get their loved ones recovered and healthy again after you treat the patient with all your love and care with your staff member help too of MADHU (BHANDUP WEST)hospital.

On behalf of our family, I wish to thank you for your expert care and professional wisdom during my mother's battle with the BLADDER INFECTION IN UTERUS SINCE 3 MOTHS.

Thank you for being patient with me, DAY after DAY DURING WHOLE WEEK during my MOTHER treatment towards fast recovery. On each and every trip to your clinic, I see the future getting  brighter ahead with all your love and support of care. (My mother (Neelam Ghag) got ADMITTED on 23rd July 2019 Tue- OPERATED ON 26th Fri - and discharged on 29th July ) My mother always say me the operation was done by god in the Operation theatre and she really mean that words you cured her out of the critical pain.

 

Thank you very much for the phenomenal job SACHINJI!! Now, that I can move again, I'm speechless to express how thankful I am to you for gifting my MOTHER LIFE again to make me smile and my Father too. You are a blessing to our lives as well as to other patients who have suffered similar conditions as my mother.  This greeting is for YOU SACHIN DALAAL & NISHA K and TEAM with your staff of hospitals on behalf of my MOTHER, FATHER AND MEE (Sangeeta Anil Ghag - Daughter of Neelam G).

Dear doctor, thanks for teaching me the difference between Fact and Faith: Fact is when any ordinary doctor diagnoses illness in a report. Faith is when good doctors like you give their patients the strength to recover.

 

It was a blessing knowing you. Thank God and you for everything you did to give your BEST.
