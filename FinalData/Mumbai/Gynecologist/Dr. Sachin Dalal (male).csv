"Treatment satisfaction,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"It was a wonderful experience with Mr. Sachin . My Laparoscopy was done by him and he did it in the most smooth way. Prior to that, I had my HSG test done twice by Dr. Shreya. HSG, as people say is a very painful process, but my HSG was done in a very painless way. That is the reason may be, I could survive two HSG. On the operation day I was very very scared as it was my first operation ever. I was a troublemaker in the hospital. but Dr. Sneha and Anesthetist Dr. Shetty handled me in a very easy and smooth way. Other staff and nurses are also very supportive. Finally coming to Dr. Sachin, besides being a good doctor and an expert in his field, he is an amazing person. He is so sure of his job and has such clarity of what he is doing , that you become confident to do things. The way he gives you hope and emotional support by cheering you in a very positive way and that's what matters for a struggling couple who goes through that emotional turmoil of conceiving. I think he is a amazing doctor and an amazing person and that makes him so successful. 5 Ratings by me for Dr. Sachin and Madhu Clinic.  ",2023-10-11 14:23:03,False,True,Shikha Halder,,,
