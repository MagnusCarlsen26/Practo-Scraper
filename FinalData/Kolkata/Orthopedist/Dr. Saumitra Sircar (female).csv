"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","ACL Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Hello everyone,

Trust me Dr Saumitra Sircar is gem of a surgeon. 

I have already done my ACL surgery and my mother's knee replacement surgery under his care and expertise. I am also planning  to take his opinion in case of any further problems or my injuries.

My rehabilitation and recovery was excellent and the surgery was very successful because of his guidance, expertise and personal care.

I am an amateur athlete who received tremendous support from my Dr Sircar's side during my pre and post-operative period so that I can recover and get back to my training as fast and safe as possible.

I highly recommend him to any general patient or athlete because of his experience, behaviour, personal care and support and benevolent behaviour.

Thank you so much Dr Saumitra Sircar for your help and support.



Thanks and regards,
