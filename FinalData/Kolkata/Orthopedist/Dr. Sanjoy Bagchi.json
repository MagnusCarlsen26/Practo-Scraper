He explained the problem of Osteoarthritis pretty clean, and shared that there is no treatment to it. It will get worse with age. Even though, it felt bad while hearing this, the honest answer is all we need. With some exercise and diet control, the worse state can be delayed but not avoided. I have seen doctors who will prescribe treatments which are meaningless, just to gain more profit from patients. We did took some existing reports to him but, he told the truth that can't be denied.

Even though, it felt bad while hearing this, the honest answer is all we need. With some exercise and diet control, the worse state can be delayed but not avoided. I have seen doctors who will prescribe treatments which are meaningless, just to gain more profit from patients. We did took some existing reports to him but, he told the truth that can't be denied.
