None,None,0,0,YES,I am  32 year boy was having some problem related to my occipital area. i was having muscle cramp type feeling there along with episodes of vertigo. I visited the doctor He examined me thoroughly and guided me with medications even during the rush hours of Durga Puja when most of the doctors in town were unavailable. I was nervous after my MRI report so out of agony i called him on the morning of Saptami. But he met me in his chamber in the evening and drove away my fear. with 1 month medicine exercise and physiotherapy my problems are gone. ,2023-08-17 17:04:46,False,True,Manas Bhattacharya,,,
