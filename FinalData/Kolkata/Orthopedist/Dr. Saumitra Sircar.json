For each and every cases of Orthopaedic related issues( Bone Fracture, Knee pain, Neck pain,Arthiritis and others ) ,we are taking his consultation only.As per my understading  he is giving very less medication and instead of that prescribing proper surgical instrument for most of the cases which is very fruitful.Also number of visits is also less.As for e.g . for mother's case(age 60),  she is totally free from knee pain since 2019 after taking just one injection. My in laws surgery was done with 100% success rate with very minimum cost.My mother is now totally happy with all of her ortho related ailments ( arthritis, Tennis elbow, Fore finger pain etc ) after following his guidelines.Compare to some other doctor, He has different identity , according to me.I am recommending him to everybody for all ortho related ailments.",

My in laws surgery was done with 100% success rate with very minimum cost.My mother is now totally happy with all of her ortho related ailments ( arthritis, Tennis elbow, Fore finger pain etc ) after following his guidelines.Compare to some other doctor, He has different identity , according to me.I am recommending him to everybody for all ortho related ailments.",
