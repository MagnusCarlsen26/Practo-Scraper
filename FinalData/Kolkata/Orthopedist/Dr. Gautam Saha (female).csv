None,None,0,0,NO,I visited the doctor with pain in my right foot(also inflammation) on 23/3/23. I told him about my high uric acid history but he totally ignored. He suggested to go for x ray & after x ray he found nothing adverse in x ray and told that the pain is due to the shoes which i am wearing & needs modification. He refused to answer any questions that i asked. ***** * ******* ******* ****** * ** ********** ** **** *********** ** **** **** * ***** ****** *** ********* ** **** *** ******* ******** *** * * ** ******* **** ***** The visit was total wastage of time & money. I would not recommend this doctor ,2023-03-24 03:06:51,False,False,Kanishka Ghosh,,,
