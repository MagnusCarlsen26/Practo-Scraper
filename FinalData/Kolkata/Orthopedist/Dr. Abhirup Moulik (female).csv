None,None,0,0,Yes,"I have taken appointment and visited the hospital. Doctor was really very good and very kind with us. All the things went good only in hospital with me, I was completely  satisfied with this doctor treatment. The main issue is that doctor was not come on given time and he will be late for 1 or 2 hours, so it will be difficult for other patients because he will travel from long distance to meet the doctor. Apart from that all this are good. I would like to recommend this doctor for my friends and family members also.",2021-05-20 13:13:25,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
