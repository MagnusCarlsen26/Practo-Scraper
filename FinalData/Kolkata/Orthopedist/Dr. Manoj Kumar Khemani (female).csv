"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,Joint and Muscle Problems,",0,0,YES,"Dear Reader,Kindly read my review till the end for more clarity about Orthopaedic Surgeon Dr.Manoj Kumar Khemani. Because now it is much needed to say something about him and he really deserves this from me and other patients as well.I Started Consulting Dr.Manoj Kumar Khemani three months back for my neck pain to the left upper limb which I was suffering in the past one and half years. Finally, to get rid of that pain I first met him to get a second opinion, in which this doctor was strongly recommended by one of my colleagues. The best part about him is he makes you feel very comfortable and explains the problem and procedure clarity. however, I feel fortunate to met him at just the right time since it was not a good experience with my previous doctors regarding the same.Anyways Dr.Khemani recommend me to get few blood tests done for diagnose purpose and as a result found that there is major vitamin D3 & B12 deficiency and specially not spondylosis which declared by my previous doctors. After that he recommends me some relevant medicines. Eventually, when I was completely cured after completing two months of medicine course another incident happened. I met with an accident and my left ankle bone got fractured and misplaced with internal bleeding then again I met him and post checking my X-RAY report he suggested to go for surgery ASAP. After that I underwent for the surgery which was successfully done by him and now day by day I am feeling much better and seeing great improvement and hopefully again I will start leading my normal life soon.I am extremely happy with Dr. Manoj Kumar Khemani, I wish him great success in the year ahead. and strongly recommend everyone to consult this doctor for any kind of orthopaedic issues.

Please accept my sincere apology for being late. We live in a city where in spite of all efforts sometimes we are unable to reach in time. I am not the kind of doctor who blindly prescribes strong painkillers. Although it may give you immediate relief, it will not help to reach the proper diagnosis. I had given you a few tests to find the root cause of you problem. Some knee conditions at your age can cause long term damage to the joint and I always take knee pain very seriously. 
I don't know where you have asked for the price of the tests, but I am sure these tests could be done in less than Rs. 1800 in many labs. I agree that even this amount can be expensive for some poor people. Some govt. labs can do these tests for even less. Also I do not take fees from any patient coming for the same problem within a week. All my patients have my personal contact no. and I am available for any kind of questions.
I am sad that you were not satisfied with our services. Hope your doctor was able to permanently relieve you of your knee problem. 
We shall strive to serve you better in future.
