None,"Fatigue,Body Weakness,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Chaurasia turned out to be a very empathetic doctor. He helped me understand the root cause of my problems. While his medication gave me relief from immediate medical issues like deficiency of vitamin d and b12, his understanding of my life and lifestyle choices made me realise that I needed to lose weight to ensure that I don't catch early diabetes (my parents are diabetic and I was overweight). He helped me regain my health and my confidence (something I had given up on) gradually. He is a smart doctor who understand his patient's needs beyond what is visible. The empathy he showed helped me reap benefits of all my treatments. ",2017-02-17 18:24:35,False,True,Verified Patient,Thanks for your kind words,2017-02-22T05:03:29+0000,Dr. Kundan Chaurasia
