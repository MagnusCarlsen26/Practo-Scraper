The doctor arrived on time, and was spending a lot of time for each patients. However we did not have to wait for too long as his assistant had given us an appointment. I was happy to see that the doctor listened to the problem my father was having, saw his current prescription and blood results. Did not say a single bad thing about the current treatment, although clearly it was failing. he suggested some simple dietary changes after hearing what my father's diet was and suggested some change in medication. \nFollowing these advices, my father's sugar is much better now. Doctor occassionally goes abroad, but I have always managed to keep in touch with him via whatsapp, which is very reassuring.\nOverall I am very satisfied with Dr Chakraborty and I would suggest his name to anyone looking for better control of diabetes.\nMy father who is a pensioner is also very happy that his medication bill has more than halved after seeing him!!",

I had seen him soon after he returned from UK couple of years back  and have since got all my family and friends who are diabetic under his care. For me personally I am on only one medication that costs less than a roadside cup of tea and my sugar is down from 300 to 130. My mother was on insulin and over the last 1 year she has managed to come off it and doing great. Doctor works in England regularly so it may be a bit difficult to get his appointment immediately but he is always available on whatsapp and email for any clarification if one has any problem, even if he is in England.\n He is surely not the typical doctor we are used to seeing in Kolkata hence your experience will clearly be very different once you have seen him. *** *** ***** ****** ** ** **** * ***. We take his opinion before any medical treatment now and he always gives the best advice. After seeing him you will know that doctors are not always after our money and there are still some honest doctors around. You just need to be lucky enough ( or intelligent enough) to find them. 7 star from me",

Doctor explained I need to have regular blood tests to check my kidneys if I am on these medicines. However I never had blood test and I was given this medicine 2 years ago and nobody told me anything. The blood test showed a sodium of 122! No wonder I was feeling weak. Doctor dealt with it with utmost professionalism and confidence and changed my medication. He did not ask me to get hospitalised or give me any expensive medicines. I know about this as my father had exactly the same thing last year and my cost of treatment at that time was only 25000 including 4 days stay in nursing home and very expensive medicines.\r\n\r\nIn 1 week when I repeated the blood tests my reports were much better and I was feeling normal. I had not spent a paisa for any test or medicine. Dr. Chakraborty is THE BEST I have seen and he puts patients interest first. He is very knowledgeable confident and considerate. I hope this review will help someone somewhere.",

I wil be visiting one more time to produce the latest report of my dad. They came all the way from Assam for treatment. Previous Dr had suggested insulin by looking at the report but Anirban  said insulin is not required. One week ago Dad glucose report says 425 now it is reduced to 271.",

I was happy to see that the doctor listened to the problem my father was having, saw his current prescription and blood results. Did not say a single bad thing about the current treatment, although clearly it was failing. he suggested some simple dietary changes after hearing what my father's diet was and suggested some change in medication. \nFollowing these advices, my father's sugar is much better now. Doctor occassionally goes abroad, but I have always managed to keep in touch with him via whatsapp, which is very reassuring.\nOverall I am very satisfied with Dr Chakraborty and I would suggest his name to anyone looking for better control of diabetes.\nMy father who is a pensioner is also very happy that his medication bill has more than halved after seeing him!!",

I had seen him soon after he returned from UK couple of years back  and have since got all my family and friends who are diabetic under his care. For me personally I am on only one medication that costs less than a roadside cup of tea and my sugar is down from 300 to 130. My mother was on insulin and over the last 1 year she has managed to come off it and doing great. Doctor works in England regularly so it may be a bit difficult to get his appointment immediately but he is always available on whatsapp and email for any clarification if one has any problem, even if he is in England.\n He is surely not the typical doctor we are used to seeing in Kolkata hence your experience will clearly be very different once you have seen him. *** *** ***** ****** ** ** **** * ***. We take his opinion before any medical treatment now and he always gives the best advice. After seeing him you will know that doctors are not always after our money and there are still some honest doctors around. You just need to be lucky enough ( or intelligent enough) to find them. 7 star from me",

Doctor explained I need to have regular blood tests to check my kidneys if I am on these medicines. However I never had blood test and I was given this medicine 2 years ago and nobody told me anything. The blood test showed a sodium of 122! No wonder I was feeling weak. Doctor dealt with it with utmost professionalism and confidence and changed my medication. He did not ask me to get hospitalised or give me any expensive medicines. I know about this as my father had exactly the same thing last year and my cost of treatment at that time was only 25000 including 4 days stay in nursing home and very expensive medicines.\r\n\r\nIn 1 week when I repeated the blood tests my reports were much better and I was feeling normal. I had not spent a paisa for any test or medicine. Dr. Chakraborty is THE BEST I have seen and he puts patients interest first. He is very knowledgeable confident and considerate. I hope this review will help someone somewhere.",

It's like getting to see a doctor in England in Kolkata! I was surprised how little medication he gives rather he concentrates more on lifestyle changes, very little tips here and there not like you have to go join a gym or something! I was on 7 different medicines sir made it into 2 and after 3 months now I am on one medication. I am a different person now Thanks to Sir. ",

She was on multiple medication until we visited Dr. Anirban Chakraborty who reduced her medication and completely changed the way we used to look at the problem. With minimal medication and lifestyle changes he has managed to bring my Mother\u2019s diabetes to normalcy. Dr. Anirban is a good listener and is very approachable. He responds to patients even when he is out of the country. In case of any serious doubts or problems in between visits, he is available on whatsapp which is of immense help to the patients. He also makes the patient more confident about recovering and about management of the condition.",

I've consulted many doctors during this period, all of them prescribed me very expensive medicines and never advised me that what diet should I follow exactly. The medicines worked only for a certain period of time. But three months back I met Dr. Anirban Chakraborty for the first time and believe me, he diagnosed me ******** and not only prescribed me medicine which is very low in cost but he also helped me with my diet plan and gave me courage that I can reverse this disease. And after three months my sugar levels are well within normal range. I'm feeling energetic and healthy and confident . All thanks to Dr. Anirban Chakraborty. He's very friendly. Being a diabetic I would suggest every one who is suffering not only with diabetes but any disease, they should see Dr. Anirban Chakraborty because everyone has the right to stay healthy.\nMy sincerest thanks to Dr. Anirban Chakraborty.",

Dr. Chakraborty went on to patiently explain the benefits of each. I followed the advices as best as I could. Now when I went back for a checkp after 3 months, I have absolutely normal blood pressure & pulse. I have also lost 3 kilos. If I was started on a hypertension medicine instead right when I was diagnosed, I would probably be taking them throughout my life and not with good consequences.Thanks for saving me the trouble of that!",
