"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","backpain,",0,0,YES,"
I recently had the pleasure of receiving treatment from Dr. Ashita Kuruvilla for a persistent back pain issue, and I am thrilled to share my experience. From the initial consultation to the final follow-up, Dr. Kuruvilla demonstrated exceptional expertise and a compassionate approach. She took the time to thoroughly assess my condition, explained the treatment plan in detail, and ensured I was comfortable throughout the process.

Thanks to her targeted and effective treatment, my back pain has significantly improved. I am now able to move more freely and enjoy daily activities without discomfort. Dr. Kuruvilla's dedication to her patients and her skillful approach to treatment have truly made a difference in my quality of life. I highly recommend her to anyone seeking a knowledgeable and caring specialist for back pain or any other musculoskeletal issues.
