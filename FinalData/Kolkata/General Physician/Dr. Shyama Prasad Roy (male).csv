"Treatment satisfaction,","Geriatric Healthcare,Consultation,Domiciliary /Home visit if required ,",0,0,NO,"I found Dr Roy on Practo. Dr Roy came home to see my 90 year old mother several times. In fact he set up a set of nurses and also sent his assistant to come and collect blood etc and also to talk to my mother.  My mother had slowed down and had mobility issues. Dr Roy conducted several blood tests and came to the conclusion that she had rheumatoid arthritis. The RA factor was 3.6 according to the report and her CRP was 6.3. He started her on medications  (Sazo 500 and HCQS 200). He also gave her Trajenta Duo (for blood sugar), cardace 2.5, Ecosprin IV/25, Cilaheart T (and at ne point Cilaheart 10) besides Ostospray, Vit D3, Ostocalcium, Folvite, Fludac 20,  and bedtime medicines changed from Alprax.25 and Serlift to Newcita plus and then Ativan 1 mg which she was taking earlier. The medicines kept changing as he said he was calibrating the drugs. ** ***** *** **** *** **** *** ************** *** ********** *** * ********** ******* At one point, she had a swelling in her hand and he insisted on an X-Ray which showed no injury but the report from Medwin medical Service failed to comment on the osteoporosis which was obvious from the X-Ray plate as our later doctor informed us. Since I do not live in Kolkata, I was reassured by the fact that the doctor visited frequently and checked on my mother. But it was a fact that my mother was not feeling better at all despite all these interventions. But the tests continued. 
Dr Paul Path was the Lab that Dr Roy used for the tests. This Lab had diagnosed a substantial e.coli infection in my mother on 16 February 2019. The nurses Dr. Roy had sent for my mother gave her only half of the antibiotic and we saw the infection rise according to urine culture done on 5 March 2019 at the same lab. ** ****** *** *** ***** **** ** *** *********** **** **** ********** *** ****** **** *** **** **** *** ******* After this, I came back to Kolkata on 10 March as my mother was feeling really unwell. At this point, the doctor wanted to do the Holter monitor test on my mother. By then she had had enough of tests and interventions and since her condition had deteriorated, we changed doctors. We repeated the urine culture test ** ***** ***** on 12 March 2019 and found the Culture sterile. We were alerted to the fact that Dr Roy was doing all pathological tests at Dr Paul Path which was not a NABL lab. ** ** ****** ****** ******** **** *** *** ***** ******* ***** **** ***** **** ******** ** **** **** **** ** ** * ******* **** *** ****** ****** ****** ****** *** *********** ** * **** **** **** * ****** ****** ** *********** *** **** ***** ** *** ****** **** ** ******** ***** ** ******** *** **** ********** ******** Dr Roy's insistence on the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis had perhaps clouded his judgement. My mother lived alone and I was reassured by a doctor who came home. But all these interventions did not help my mother so there was no treatment satisfaction despite huge amounts spent on doctor fee, nurse and assistant fee, tests, X-Ray and medicines. There are many like me who support their parents from a different city and we might be tempted to go with a doctor who comes home. Since as lay persons we are unable judge the diagnostic skills of a doctor, *** *************** *** ** ****** ** ****** ***** I am sharing my experience so others like me can be more cautious.",2019-04-09 13:11:43,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
