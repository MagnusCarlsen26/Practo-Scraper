"Value for money,Wait time,","Coronary Angiogram,",0,0,NO,"Hospital staff is totally inefficient and doctor is not at all courteous. He takes too many appointments and then goes for surgery in between. Went for consultation at 1.20 and till 5 he didnâ€™t consult us. Out of frustration , had to ask for refund . They treat patients as if they are consulting then for free. Extremely dissatisfied. ",2021-01-05 13:22:28,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Cardiac Diseases,",0,0,NO,"It's disappointing experience with the doctor. He didn't have time to hear patient's problem. Before listening he starts writing prescription for the tests to be done in B M Birla Hospital and it's instantly. No scope for discussion with him. No specific appointment schedule. I have an appointment for 2 pm slot but practically I get a chance around 5 pm to meet him. No serial, no queue, horrible experience. No sitting space there. It's unfortunate....",2021-01-05 10:59:26,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
