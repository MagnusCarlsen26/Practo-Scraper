None,None,0,0,YES,"Initially, I was very upset with Dr.Kahali as barely spoke and pressed for admission in CCU for my thorough examination including coronary angiography. The prima facie apparently rude behaviour of the doctor created a negative impression on me. So, I came back without listening to his advice. Actually, I should have listened. After few days, feeling acute chest pain and tightness in chest, I was compelled to be admitted in a reputed Heart Institute and carried out my Coronary Angiography and other tests in the same manner that was prescribed earlier. During my stay at that hospital, I found Dr.Kahalai talking well to his patients after their angiography and recommending them necessary medicines with careness. So, on 2nd thought based on my first hand experience, I would recommend Dr.Kahali. I am sorry for my initial review on that old man. He is surely an experienced doctor.
