I was referred to him by one of the leading Orthodontist of Kolkata  who was treating my son. The resaons for my visit  was to take his opinion after being a victim of improperly carried out RCT in my lower right side teeth which was done elsewhere and I was having lot of problems and also for fixing a bridge on my upper left side.\nHe carried out re-RCT and fixed the bridge which took few sittings. I was visiting him from Ranchi for this treatment and I used to fix up prior appointments before visiting him which worked out  smoothly without any inconvenience to me. I am very much satisfied with his treatment and I do not have any problem now. \nI was fortunate that I could see Dr Chakraborty who analysed the problem thoroughly and solved it to my satisfaction. I have received the most professional and high quality service. He is gentle, caring, ************* and perfectionist. His support team is excellent.  Isn\u2019t that what we are looking for our dental treatment. I would recommend him to every one.",

Before meeting Dr. Dipta , I thought that removing old bridge might damage my supporting tooth. But, it went smoothly and it took only 15 min to remove the old one.                                     Then, he suggested me to go with Zirconia bridge as currently Zirconia is best for bridge. On first day, old bridge got removed and tooth impression is taken. Our next appointment was after 2 days and it was basically a trail day, in which they check if everything is fine. If any modifications needed, then they sent bridge to lab. But in my case, it didn't need any modifications. So overall it took 4 days. I really want to thank Dr.  Dipta  and his entire supporting staff for their service .",
