Your treatment was done in 2016 and you are giving us feedback after almost 5years of treatment. Thank you for your feedback. The crown you said was very expensive and our clinic offer variety of crowns frm which patients  can choose for themselves and there is no obligation from our side. And suppose you chose for expensive crown,clinic must have offered you warranty for the crown, so if it had broken after 5 years, you could have contacted our clinic and claimed its warranty. We would have happily served you. Incase of any problem, our team has always been ready to give you appointment but rather taking an appointment in all these 5 years or calling us for your any problem, you rather chose to give us feedback. I would request you to approch the clinic and if any problem is there get your treatment done.",2021-03-08T08:21:01+0000,Dr. Pallavi Mittal
