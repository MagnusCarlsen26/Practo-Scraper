The challenge of the dentist therefore is to earn the trust and confidence of the patient as quickly as possible. After the two sittings  I have so far had with Shruti, I am pleased to say that I feel comfortable with her. Her procedures on my teeth (root canal and preparation for subsequent capping) were carried out flawlessly. She also had maintained good communication with me right through the procedures and helped me relax. The only downside I have to mention is that I found her support staff below par. When asked to hand over an instrument or an accessory, they often took a very long time, which in my experience is very unusual.  This is probably a training and management issue, but it needs the attention of the owners of the clinic.  ",

Highly professional, well maintained, extremely well mannered nurses and staff and very competent doctors! My wife was treated by Dr Shruti Agarwal, and she was a revelation to us. Other doctors in Kolkata took a very clinical view of the problem, but Dr Shruti understood and addressed  the emotional and psychological effects as well. She gave us a couple of options and explained the positive and negative aspects of all the options. She patiently answered all our queries, no matter how many times we asked her. Her handiwork is unbelievable - you cannot even make out that the front five teeth are artificial. She does not have the \"I am the doctor, I know it all\" attitude and she keeps herself updated with all the latest development in her field. You don't get to see that happen a lot, specially in doctors from Kolkata. She has a way of calming down the patients with practical, but very positive attitude and talks. In all our interactions with other doctors from all fields, we have never met anyone in whom you can have complete trust, and know, that whatever she will do, she will do with your best interests in her heart, and you will come out with a smile - literally!! We wish the best to Aesthetica and to Dr. Shruti Agarwal. Thanks.",

She has recommend rct on my wisdom tooth, with latest painless technology they had, that too only 2 sittings. I have paid around 15000 for rct of one tooth only. But right after rct, I had so much pain for first week and was feeling uncomfortable, I have visited clinic 3-4 times, everytime she has done xray, and told me everything is fine, then she grinded other teeth on my compliant, but she did nothing about my wisdom tooth pain, this pain u have tolerated for almost 7-8 months by thinking may be because healing will take time. But finally i have visited Cmc Vellore, they have done full mouth xray and told tooth is in very bad situation, immediately extraction is required, then I have visited some other specialist in bangalore, everyone recommend immediate extraction, and has also told that situation is that bad, that no one can guarantee proper healing as rct has created too much infection in gums.  Now my tooth is extracted, but still infection doesn't go away, and doctors are suggesting surgery in case infection prevails. \nI don't know why this doctor has not attended the case seriously, when I have visited her so many times for complaints. I had worst experience, I have wasted my money and time, and still facing the after effects. Please think twice before choosing ur dentist. \n",

I was made to sit directly on the patient inclining seat for carrying medical dental procedures and had to explain things looking up.Trust me its not very happy scenario. Its like u go to a doctor for check up and he makes u lie directly on the operation theater to check you up and yes... a summary of the entire dental cost for all other areas is also made right in front of you on a computer screen...You are just a potential maximum billing prospect for the clinic/ doctor...

The challenge of the dentist therefore is to earn the trust and confidence of the patient as quickly as possible.

Her procedures on my teeth (root canal and preparation for subsequent capping) were carried out flawlessly. She also had maintained good communication with me right through the procedures and helped me relax. The only downside I have to mention is that I found her support staff below par. When asked to hand over an instrument or an accessory, they often took a very long time, which in my experience is very unusual.  This is probably a training and management issue, but it needs the attention of the owners of the clinic.  ",

Both of us were impressed by the quality of its services. So,I decided to come here myself this time.\nWe observed that all the doctors are knowledgeable and dedicated. They are transparent and friendly. There is a commendable degree of efficiency through out the rank and file.\nDoctors Anindita, Arpita, Shruti and Sayantan took me chronologically through the various steps  of Initial Check-up, Scaling, RCT, measurement and Crown fitting with care and patience. Thanks to them and the team.\nFinally, a big acknowledgment of the fine efforts and appreciation for Dr. Bhattacharya and Dr. Shruti Agarwal for shaping this fine facility.",

Highly professional, well maintained, extremely well mannered nurses and staff and very competent doctors! My wife was treated by Dr Shruti Agarwal, and she was a revelation to us. Other doctors in Kolkata took a very clinical view of the problem, but Dr Shruti understood and addressed  the emotional and psychological effects as well. She gave us a couple of options and explained the positive and negative aspects of all the options. She patiently answered all our queries, no matter how many times we asked her. Her handiwork is unbelievable - you cannot even make out that the front five teeth are artificial. She does not have the \"I am the doctor, I know it all\" attitude and she keeps herself updated with all the latest development in her field. You don't get to see that happen a lot, specially in doctors from Kolkata. She has a way of calming down the patients with practical, but very positive attitude and talks. In all our interactions with other doctors from all fields, we have never met anyone in whom you can have complete trust, and know, that whatever she will do, she will do with your best interests in her heart, and you will come out with a smile - literally!! We wish the best to Aesthetica and to Dr. Shruti Agarwal. Thanks.",

She has recommend rct on my wisdom tooth, with latest painless technology they had, that too only 2 sittings. I have paid around 15000 for rct of one tooth only. But right after rct, I had so much pain for first week and was feeling uncomfortable, I have visited clinic 3-4 times, everytime she has done xray, and told me everything is fine, then she grinded other teeth on my compliant, but she did nothing about my wisdom tooth pain, this pain u have tolerated for almost 7-8 months by thinking may be because healing will take time. But finally i have visited Cmc Vellore, they have done full mouth xray and told tooth is in very bad situation, immediately extraction is required, then I have visited some other specialist in bangalore, everyone recommend immediate extraction, and has also told that situation is that bad, that no one can guarantee proper healing as rct has created too much infection in gums.  Now my tooth is extracted, but still infection doesn't go away, and doctors are suggesting surgery in case infection prevails. \nI don't know why this doctor has not attended the case seriously, when I have visited her so many times for complaints. I had worst experience, I have wasted my money and time, and still facing the after effects. Please think twice before choosing ur dentist. \n",

I was made to sit directly on the patient inclining seat for carrying medical dental procedures and had to explain things looking up.Trust me its not very happy scenario. Its like u go to a doctor for check up and he makes u lie directly on the operation theater to check you up and yes... a summary of the entire dental cost for all other areas is also made right in front of you on a computer screen...You are just a potential maximum billing prospect for the clinic/ doctor...
