Secondly, regarding your case, myself being a specialist periodontal surgeon, I feel it is an absolute must to get your wisdom tooth extracted surgically considering its position inside your jaw and the degree of pericoronitis and associated gum infection you were suffering from because of that impacted wisdom tooth. Your pain has subsided only temporarily because of the antibiotics and painkillers which were prescribed. But I repeat that this is only a temporary relief and the pain will occur with more severity anytime in near future and it will be a recurrent chronic problem if you don't get that impacted wisdom tooth extracted. 
SURGICAL EXTRACTION OF THE IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH IS THE ONLY PERMANENT SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM. 
This is my opinion being a specialist in this field and having more than 10 years of experience in seeing and handling such cases.

He charged me rs.500.00 instead of 300.00 as mentioned in practo for the consultation. I went to a different doc for second opinion and she fixed my pain with merely 200 rs consultation with 95 rs antibiotic and 54 rs antispectic mouth gel. Very bad experience with Dr.Chandra.",2016-08-05 06:58:51,False,False,Arijit,"Mr. Arijit, you came with the problem of recurrent swelling and pain in the upper incisive papilla region of your palatal gum tissue. I noticed you have an extremely deep bite in the anterior region of mouth, your upper central incisors are rotated inwards and your lower incisors are intruded. That is why everytime  when you are biting, the edges of your lower incisors are impinging on the opposing gum tissue at the incisive papilla region of your palate. This constant trauma on the gum tissue is causing recurrent swelling and pain in that region. In no way any antibiotic or any antiseptic gel is going to give you a permanent cure or solution to your problem until and unless your anterior deep bite is corrected and your teeth are aligned properly. Medicines and ointments will only give you stopgap or temporary relief from pain, but it will again recur for sure. So anterior deep bite correction is of prime importance for you for a permanent solution to your problem.
Regarding consultation fees, I have done selective grinding with respect to your lower incisors for which I have charged Rs.200 over and above my consultation fees of Rs. 300. So the cumulative total fees charged from you was Rs. 500. My consultation fees is always Rs. 300 as shown in Practo.
