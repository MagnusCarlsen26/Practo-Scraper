I fell down from my college bus on a busy street and broke one of my incisors. I came to Doctor Panda a week later. Sir checked the condition of my tooth and asked me to get a root canal treatment done to two of my teeth. The RCT really helped to reduce the pain and prevent extraction. He also did a temporary filling to make the tooth look decent. \nThe arrangement of my teeth was not exactly perfect which made my smile look a little distorted since childhood. Sir helped me fix that too by a method popularly known as 'smile correction'. This process basically includes crown cutting followed by a temporary teeth attachment. The permanent teeth (all ceramic crown in my case) is attached a few days later.\nThe translucent crown looks way better than my original teeth and can be hardly distinguished from real. My smile looks so much prettier than before, something way beyond my imagination. I smile in all my pictures these days unlike before. \nDr. B.Panda and Dr. K.Chatterjee has both made this possible which has sort of given me a new look altogether. They are simply amazing professionals and I feel really lucky to have got my treatment done by them. I would forever be grateful to them.",

They use advanced tools and techniques to perform the treatment which is one of the reasons for the pain-free experience. The anesthesia applied before treatment and the post-treatment pain control and anti-infection medicines prescribed by them were very good, which also prevented any kind of pain. We followed all the post-treatment tooth care instructions exactly as provided by them. Definitely recommend Whitezone Clinic for any kind of dental problems.",

I fell down from my college bus on a busy street and broke one of my incisors. I came to Doctor Panda a week later. Sir checked the condition of my tooth and asked me to get a root canal treatment done to two of my teeth. The RCT really helped to reduce the pain and prevent extraction. He also did a temporary filling to make the tooth look decent. \nThe arrangement of my teeth was not exactly perfect which made my smile look a little distorted since childhood. Sir helped me fix that too by a method popularly known as 'smile correction'. This process basically includes crown cutting followed by a temporary teeth attachment. The permanent teeth (all ceramic crown in my case) is attached a few days later.\nThe translucent crown looks way better than my original teeth and can be hardly distinguished from real. My smile looks so much prettier than before, something way beyond my imagination. I smile in all my pictures these days unlike before. \nDr. B.Panda and Dr. K.Chatterjee has both made this possible which has sort of given me a new look altogether. They are simply amazing professionals and I feel really lucky to have got my treatment done by them. I would forever be grateful to them.",

Everything including the RCT and tooth extraction went smooth and painless. Everyone in the team is very kind, they took time to explain elaborately what the problems are, and how they will be fixed. They use advanced tools and techniques to perform the treatment which is one of the reasons for the pain-free experience. The anesthesia applied before treatment and the post-treatment pain control and anti-infection medicines prescribed by them were very good, which also prevented any kind of pain. We followed all the post-treatment tooth care instructions exactly as provided by them. Definitely recommend Whitezone Clinic for any kind of dental problems.",

First time when we go she was frightened about treatment but after warm welcome she feels friendly. The treatment was really so good n feel homely with staff and main important thing that cost was reasonable.Got perfect treatment...really satisfied with service. Now my family are now moving but still whenever I need any dental treatment I'll definitely come to Dr.Biswajit Panda. In this clinic there is moderate rush at most time but I think no one mind to wait for few more minutes to good service. This the first place where I m so satisfied and want to give more star rating for your hard work and kindness. Thanks for good service , I recommend to all my friends n relatives. By d way I also have short pain So I wanna ask you that do I need to get x ray done before root canal ? And also I don't take so much leaves so how long to get back to work after procedure ?",
