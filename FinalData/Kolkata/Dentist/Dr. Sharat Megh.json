Sit with him for any process of treatment and post treatment next hour you may go back to office for your important  work meeting , That much smooth and expertise treatment he offers to his patients. Going to him is more of a going to family friend and not going to a Dental Surgeon. Strongly and highly recommended to all , before going to any other Dentist , please come to him and experience his service of treatment , sure you will not go back to any other dentist in life.",
