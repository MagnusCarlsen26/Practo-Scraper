None,"Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"My mother has been facing pain in her teeth since a few years as one molar cracked while she was snacking on a local delicacy. She visited several dentists but none understood her problem precisely and could give her a solution.
A visit to MSDC with Dr. Angshuman and his multi-speciality team gave us several options to go about the treatment. After trying out a Root Canal, I was pleasantly surprised that the doctor actually texted me the same night to find out how my mother was dealing with the pain. Out of the scores of patients they treat every day the doctor actually followed up with a patient.
If that was not commendable enough, MSDC impressed me yet again. Ultimately, my mother had to go for an extraction of her tooth to be replaced with an implant 3 months later. On the day of the tooth extraction, a member of MSDC's panel, Dr. Nitubrata still did his duty even though Dr. Nitubrata's wife was facing severe pain in her chest and was admitted in the ICU ward. The extraction was done painlessly and the cracked tooth came out in pieces. After extraction my mother can continue delighting on her favourite ice creams and we look forward to the implant process, as well.
Kudos to the focused leadership of Dr. Angshuman and the service oriented team at Mission Smile Dental Centre (MSDC).

"Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,I would have appreciated had I been informed at the first instance itself that you do not cater to paediatric ortho-dentistry then it would have saved both time & money. I was aware of my son's tooth cavity which is why I needed to consult a dentist. But just for getting a reference to another Doctor for the necessary treatment I feel paying Rs.600/- was not worth it. This could have been told to me at the reception itself that you do not treat children.,2017-09-06 04:02:17,False,True,Verified Patient,Ofcourse we cater to Pediatric ortho dentsitry. For your information its a normal protocol worldwide to get your child's routine Orthodontic Check up done  before age 7 years on a 6 monthly basis. We do that and lots of other Orthodontic treatment for kids as early as 5 yearsin Mission Smile. We assessed your child's cavity as a chief complaint and also educated  you that it should be done by a pediatric dentist and not by any of the 12 specialist dentist in our main branch who also treat cavities. Moreover a dentist is not trained to handle the pschological management which is required to give a pleasant first time experience to a young child while treating him. Pedodontists are trained to manage the emotional component of the child during treatment.  We gave you an unbiased honest opinion. And this is because cavity preparation of milk teeth is technique sensitive and different from adult teeth which most patients dont realise and they just come looking for a dentist. You had come searching for a Dentist but we checked your child and gave you the right guidance to go to a Pedodontist. Also we definitely checked his bite and did a timely Orthodontic assessment of his teeth which you as a parent should be aware of. There are some children who come to us for this Ortho dentistry at a very late age and we find hidden cross bites with growth deficiencies of their jaw which cannot be corrected then. So good that you got your child screened for crossbites and underbites which could always be unwantedly present in thier teeth. Your money definitely didnt go to waste. For cavities of milk teeth most parents donot even know the fact that it should be treated by a Pedodontist. And we rightly referred you to our Pediatric Wing. Anyways Cavities are never filled for a very young child on the very first day. Thats a protocol to gain his confidence in a new environment. So time is something you have to invest when its your own child!,2017-09-08T10:03:27+0000,Dr. Angshuman Bhattacharya

As you know Dentistry is a multi speciality field and there are 9 Post graduate Subjects and specialisations. Your Mom Mrs. Binata Naskar is a Stage 4 Cancer Patient and has undergone Radiation therapy. She is extremely fragile and susceptible to infections. So it was my duty and responsibilty to immediately involve a Periodontist and Geriatric dentist who is specialised to handle such cases. Since he was fortunately present that day i thought it would be apt to show her to him immediately as this is his field where he has 15 years of experience. I being the Director of the Centre am in a better position to understand which patient should be seen by which specialist. You took all the suggestions and we answered all your queries and even gave her the required medicines and planned for future treatment. Never did you once complain about any negligence on our part and also were mutually discussing with your mother about the dates for future treatment. Then how come all of a sudden totally out of the blue you make such defamatory remarks that too on social media to a doctor who has been compassionate and was trying to provide you the best speciality service.
