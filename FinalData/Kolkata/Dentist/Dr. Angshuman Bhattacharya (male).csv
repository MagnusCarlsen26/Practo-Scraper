"Doctor friendliness,Value for money,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,It was too expensive. This clinic is not for a poor people. They took Rs.2100 for a single teeth surgery. The doctor was very rude. The other staff was friendly.,2020-04-07 12:03:31,False,True,Verified Patient,It was a wisdom tooth removal which was done painlessly.  You were saying over telephone that that your mother is in severe pain. We opened the clinic to do the emergency extraction to alleviate your pain. Kindly appreciate the fact that we opened the clinic calling limited staff just to give relief to your mother. If completion of Covid19 safety declaration came across as being rude to you then you should understand that its a social responsibilty of all to speak the truth. We hope that we could give respite to your mother from acute pain by providing the services in this hour of crisis by taking special permits to travel and come in for this. Rs 900 was the consultation and Rs1200 for WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL with PPE measures and that is a very standard charge in a clinic which maintains strict protocols of sterilisation and safety measures. And all our patients are equally important to us.,2020-04-07T15:16:55+0000,Dr. Angshuman Bhattacharya
