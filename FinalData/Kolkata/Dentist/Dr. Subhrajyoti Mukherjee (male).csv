"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Surgery,Oral Ulcer,Dental Treatment,",0,0,NO,"**** ** *** ** *** *** **** *** ******* ****** ******* ** ******** In 2014, when I visited him he was polite and performed my wisdom teeth surgery with patience.
However being a full time dental surgeon with Apollo, he never maintains time. Time given here is till 5 pm. I called him yesterday for extraction of my number 7 molar, and he asked me to come in second half. But due to my surprise, at 3:10 he asked the reception to cancel all appointment as he has an emergency OT. I called him, he told OT might take time and I may have to wait till 7. I agreed for it, as I cannot afford leave or loss of pay everyday.
After few minutes he informed receptionist again and asked to cancel my appointment. I specifically asked , he is going to do the OT in apollo itself , answer was affirmative. Then I got a message from him saying he is attending a friends clinic for emergency which is not permissible as he works full time with apollo, because I also gave him the option to visit that place and get my extraction done, then he fired on me over phone and shouted at me in Bengali which I am quoting here “Ami ki apnar daas khot sign korechi, je amni ja bollben tai hobe, Ami amake bar bar amar personal number e phone kore birokto korchen (that was the number he publishes in his prescription, so don’t know how come that become his personal number). Ami apnake dekhbo na, you can complain to apollo management “ .
I still tried to make up by apologizing hime, without any fault of mine. I was in emergency and visited him on 3rd of April, where he himself suggested to extract as there is a lesion below the RCT teeth. But didn’t get any response.

None,None,0,0,NO,"Sometimes doctors need to be **** * **** ****** understanding the pain of the patient, than a doctor. This dentist is not worth visiting. He is very rude and has zero empathy, sympathy, compassion and kindness. Post extraction (wisdom tooth), my mother (senior citizen) tried asking what should be done? His approach was horrible, callous and unforgivable. Avoid this dentist. ",2022-08-08 12:23:24,False,False,Palash Roy Choudhury,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,*** * **** ****** *** **** ******** ******** ** *** ******* **** *** **** *** ** ******** **************** I went to show my oral disease but he told me initially that it can't be cured but he didn't check me up ever in my life. No solution given by this doctor and arguing with me for the treatment given by my past doctors. So don't visit otherwise you will be losing of your hard earned money. ,2023-08-05 08:21:04,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
