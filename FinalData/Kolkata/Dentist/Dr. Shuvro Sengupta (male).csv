"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Fillings,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Crowns,",0,0,YES,"It is an honour to write a review for the dental treatment administered by Dr Sengupta. I was recovering from a very critical post-covid haul when I realized that I needed some dental treatment. As his clinic is situated in the same neighbourhood where I stay; I approached him one day with little doubt on how my new dentist was going to be. After my first visit, I was convinced that I came to the right dentist as he explained what were the problems and how they could be treated. I have done two re-RCT and changed my over-sized crown of one tooth, treated pockets which was troubling me for months and without any hassle. 
Dr Sengupta's clinic is clean and disabled friendly. He pays extra attention to covid protocols and keeps the space hygienic. He also uses very good quality material, and the best part is that for a curious and fussy patient like me, he explains every thing very patiently! He is very professional and as well as friendly. At one point I have thought, our country needs good doctors like him who has such sound knowledge of the profession they are in and providing services to so many citizens. 
During one of the sessions, which dragged for 2 months, I faced a neuro related pain. He took extra care by following up with me, recommended the right medicine and never charged me extra for follow-up consultations. Dental treatments are expensive but at the end it's worth paying if one gets a super quality treatment as provided by Dr Sengupta. I highly recommend fellow citizens and friends to consult him in case one needs a dental treatment. 
I must say this as a queer rights activist, I have felt extremely comfortable and not received any biased or homophobic attitude from him which I have faced in the past from a few medical practitioners. My queer folx can approach Dr Sengupta without any inhibition or hesitation.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr Shuvro Sengupta has treated me in a way which is really unbelievable in today's time. I was nurturing a painful tooth,  was avoiding treatment and relying 
on painkillers. Then I visited a few clinics and was suggested rct and crowns. Likewise I went to Dr Sengupta for another opinion. He performed tests on my tooth (biting down/hot-cold, etc.) and determined that I did in fact need to have a root canal. But his honesty and willingness to explain my problem did the trick. He also didn't try to "" sell "" crowns by using words like warranty cards. I decided then and there, I will get my treatment done from him .

After administering injection and waiting for anesthesia to start it's effects he asked how I was feeling. He checked to make sure I was completely numb and then he gave me protective clothing. He began the procedure. I'm not sure how long I was lying there or what he was doing. My eyes were closed. I didn’t feel uncomfortable. After 1 hour, he informed me he had finished 1st appointment's work . It really was not like what I was expecting. The 2nd and final appointment also went very well. I appreciate how he kept checking on how I was doing throughout the procedure. Then he explained to me the next steps: What to do and not do within the next several hours, what to take for any possible pain, how to take care of the tooth before I get my permanent crown. I left the clinic incredulous to just how seamless the experience was. 

He seems to be quite experienced in his field. It's not easy mentally preparing yourself for a root canal; but he made the experience and procedure comfortable and ideal.

The dental procedure I needed took 2 appointments. I felt at every moment that I was getting the best trained and most capable medical care.

Rather, he did an ingenious thing by placing graft material in that place which resulted in no bone loss. 3 weeks later , he retreated the back molar which had rct years ago. It was absolutely painless. The tooth became an anchor tooth for the dental bridge he placed to replace the extracted tooth.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Zirconia Crowns,",0,0,YES,"I had two molars (unfortunately on the same side of the lower jaw) that required immediate attention, because though not in great pain I would wake up most mornings spitting blood and was suffering from nearly continuous infections, including fevers and inflammation. One of these was an empty shell that exposed the root, the other but a broken stub missing more than half of the tooth.  It was decided that the final decision as to whether or not one or both of the bad teeth would be extracted would rest with the doctor based on whether or not anything was saveable.
I received a very pleasant surprise. Both teeth were preserved. The hollow one had been cleaned, treated and filled, but even more surprisingly, the badly damaged peg next to it had been completely reconstructed and was unrecognisable from before. As I didn’t want to go down the implant path, it is as good as would ever be possible under the circumstances, and this was all due to the great skill of the doctor. The other tooth though is a wonder, I had thought it was unsalvageable, but he made it as good as new, this factor alone more than justified the expense-
which was less than what implant would have been. 

A friend in the form of a dentist - he is professional, polite & extremely personable. Although I dont live in that area I will travel as far as I have to in order to continue treatment with Dr Sengupta.",2023-08-18 14:16:53,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

I found him very intelligent, professional and he easily explained my situation and what needed to be done and how.  He’s calm, steady, easy to talk with . I immediately went online to educate myself further on both root canals and Dr Sengupta. 
After reading the reviews left behind by past patients, I felt lucky to have found Dr Sengupta  . All the reviews held true, the fact that he was so friendly and considerate blew away my expectations.  I believe that he has set the bar high for any future root canals I may get done. 
I had read that root canals could take up to two hours, that root canals performed on the back teeth were trickier due to the location, and post-treatment can cause aches in the affected area. With Doctor Sengupta behind the wheel, I was in and out give or take 40-50 minutes, he was able to perform the root canal with no trouble (at least from my perspective), and with the numbing medicine worn off I have not felt pain or aches since the treatment. In my opinion, it was due to the tremendous skills of Doctor Sengupta that I was able to come out with a smile.
He was EXTREMELY patient with me the entire time. Only if I knew about him before I would not had my other tooth pulled. I highly recommend him .
