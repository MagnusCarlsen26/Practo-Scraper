I had visited her clinic for toothache while chewing, after a filling was done by a different doctor. She straight away started working on two of my molars whereas pain was just on one tooth.

She never did any Xray or even diagnosed the root cause and started working on my tooth. After doing the Root Canal(which was very painful even after anesthesia) she put the shiny new crown on two of my molars. The next 4 months have been the most horrible time of my life. I got a gum infection because she had cut my gums to fit the crown forcefully and it had got infected from the root. after showing a new dentist overseas he said Dr Sukirti has done the most horrible job even and not even cleaned the roots and put in some weird material inside which has caused more cavity because of which I had to get one of my molar extracted. The second molar which Dr Sukirti treated also got infected and now I  have to  redo Root Canal Treatment and have to buy a new crown. She not only wasted my lakhs of rupees but also made me compromise my natural tooth and months of pain.
