"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Paedodontics,Pulpectomy,GIC Tooth Fillings,",0,0,YES,"My 3 years 9 months old daughter Aaradhya was suffering from multiple tooth cavities and dental carries. I consulted dental clinic at Chennai 10 months before consulting with Dr. Goswami recently. I was very much anxious about future and its treatment of my daughter's dental problem since the dental clinic of Chennai where I visited suggested for a dental surgery of six tooth with general anesthesia. I was seriously scared hearing this solution because of some some serious outcome stories I heard about after carrying out General Anesthesia of child at this age. When I met Dr. Goswami's at Sri Arabinda Sevakendra at Jodhpur Park, Kolkata he assured me that he would carry out the complete dental treatment of my kid with local anesthesia and it won't be required any hospitalization or operation theater. Only thing that he urged was co-operation from the parents. I assured him about every co-operation from my side. With only two sittings he did unbelievable treatment. He did multiple procedures in 9 numbers of tooth ranging from pulpectomy followed by crowing, pulpectomy followed by GIC light cure restoration, GIC composite filling, tooth extraction. After her treatment there was zero complaint other that little swelling for half day. I want to thank to Dr. Abhirup Goswami for his sincere treatment plan, expertise, dedication, punctuality, behavior and total management of intricate invasive dental treatment for little children. He can be totally trusted for one's child's dental problem without hesitation. My good wish and respect for his professionalism will always be there for Dr. Abhirup Goswami.
