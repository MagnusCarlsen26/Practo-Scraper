I chose to consult Dr Nikita only after reading some of the stellar reviews and boy, I am glad to have made the right decision. Dr Nikita ensures patients' comfort before the treatment. Tooth extraction is supposed to be the most painful treatment in dentistry but I am not exaggerating when I say that my tooth extraction was a complete painless experience. my post extraction treatment has also been great and Dr Nikita has not charged me yet considering that the bridge implementation is still pending. howmuchever I have tried to pay upfront, I have been told that the fee is due only once treatment is completed. though I am based abroad, I am happy to say that Dr Nikita has displayed thorough professionalism, a trait which is very rare amidst the medical fraternity in India. so much so that I have already decided to consult her again during my next visit to India, even if it means me to digress from my destination in India.Dr Nikita is also a specialist in Sleep and Snoring disorder and both myself and my wife have consulted her. similar to the above, our experience has been tremendously good. ***** * ****** ** *** ***** *** ******** ******* ********* ** *** ******* we are glad to avail her services as it's very seldom that you come across such a doctor. thank you Dr Nikita for all your help in our medical journey here in India.",

To which her response was really rude. Shes seemed to get irrirated with the questions and replied very unprofesionally. She is not at all patient friendly *** **** **** ** **** My wife told me not to proceed with her for the procedure but I took a call that ok may be we got her wrong giving her the benefit of doubt. But my wife was right. *** *** ******** **** **** *** ********* *** moresoever the atmosphere inside clinic was like a fish market. She does not respect time of her patients plus the price of treatment which she quoted me at beginning varied quite a bit and she kept on changing the fees and structure. When I raised that issue, she left my treatment in between and said she wont continue. She drilled my entire tooth for putting the crown and my gums were bleeding. But she dint bother and left the treatment as it is. Mine has been a horrible experience. Please think twice before proceeding with the treatment.",
