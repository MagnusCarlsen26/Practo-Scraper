"Wait time,","Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery,",0,0,NO,Fixed an appointment for Dr S Dubey at 5:30 pm 13th August 2018. Initially Dr delayed for 30mins ..then assured to be available within 15 more mins...then didn't respond to the attendants call. we waited for more than an hour and finally Dr did not come. Later Radhika maam handled the situation and attended us. I am still far away from Dr. Dubey's proficiency but closely encountered his irresponsibility. ,2018-08-14 06:53:22,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
