None,None,0,0,NO,"My wife had an wisdom tooth which was without a problem, but there was a flappy part of the gum which was creating problem. When we visited Teeth care, she advised that instead for cutting/stitching the flappy part, it's better to remove the wisdom tooth itself.

So, we followed her instruction and she went on to remove the wisdom tooth in left jaw, but forgot to stitch the flappy part. My wife had enormous pain for a week, can't open her jaw and had no senses in left jaw and left part of the tongue. She finally attended her after 6 days after repeated calls, and use anesthesia again to stitch the flappy part. She advised to give hot press in jaw to resolve the jaw lock issue. We had very little faith remained on her, and decided to visit a very senior and renowned dentist in Kolkata, who said it was a dangerous advice to give hot press. The new doctor resolved the jaw lock issue by giving infra-red lamp vapor, but the nerve is already damaged while Dr. Arimeeta Bhadra tried to remove the wisdom tooth.

Now, my wife's left jaw and left part of the tongue are still without any senses.  IT WAS OUR BIG MISFORTUNE THAT WE HAD VISITED SOMEONE LIKE THIS DOCTOR Arimeeta Bhadra!
