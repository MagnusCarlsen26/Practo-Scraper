From the moment we walked into the clinic, we felt welcomed and at ease, which is not something you typically associate with a dental visit.\n\nDr. Anirban demonstrated a high level of professionalism and took the time to thoroughly explain the procedures, the reasons for the ReRCT, and the expected outcomes, ensuring we were well-informed and comfortable throughout the entire process, instantly putting us at ease.\n\nWhat truly sets apart is his meticulous attention to detail and commitment to patient comfort. During both the RCT and ReRCT, both my wife and son experienced minimal discomfort and absolutely no pain. He answered all of our questions with patience, and we never felt rushed during any of our appointments.\n\nAdditionally, the clinic's facilities and warm atmosphere contributed to an overall positive experience. The staff at his clinic were friendly, efficient, and accommodating, making scheduling appointments and follow-up visits a breeze.\n\nI am pleased to report that the outcome of both my wife's and son's RCT/ReRCT exceeded our expectations. The dental crown was expertly fitted, with perfect color matching and the pain they were experiencing before the procedure has completely disappeared, and we are incredibly grateful to him for their expertise and dedication to oral health.\n\nThank you, Dr. Anirban, for your exceptional work and for making our dental visits comfortable and pain-free, especially within such a short time-frame as we had to return overseas. I will definitely be returning for all of our future dental needs!\n\nWarm regards, \nDilip Ray\n",

However, after filling, the problem didn't solved and we were forced to visit him in his own clinic due to uncertainity of his presence in the corona 2nd wave lockdown. At the time of visit, he directly said it needs RCT and that too on two teeth.After that, we told we will go for RCT for 1 tooth only which was causing much pain and will go for RCT on the 2nd one after the first one is completed and stabilized. Upon hearing this, the doctor was not amused and insisted for RCT on both despite both being on two different sides of the mouth. However, we told we will go for RCT in one side only and the same was carried out. Later, for crown placement, he insisted for PFM filling whereas we proposed for Zirconia (as she is allergic to almost all metals due to which she cannot keep jewellery for longer period of time). Upon this, the dentist was miffed and he insisted for PFM for which we clarified why we cannot take the PFM crown. He was constantly deriding us and later after a nearby deep filling during which gum was cut & bleeding, he insisted for mould fitting despite the gum was bleeding/hurt. He even flipped out against the patient as she was unable to provide enough pressure as she was hurt. Later, the filling was turning out to be painful and when we requested for sometime to heal for crown fitting, he was adamant that we should visit and will try to sort out the pain. However, during visit, he didn't cared much about pain and completed his crown fitting ** **** ** ***** ** **** *** ****** ********* ** **** ******** We told we will pay advance for crown but didn't want the same to placed that time but it fell on deaf ears.Now 1 month later, the pain didn't stopped and bad smell/some bluish stuff was seen in the operated area from naked eye. The same was conveyed to the dentist and he gave us appointment few days ago. However, during visit, he was rude/inconsiderate towards the issue told by the patient and was just trying to get rid of us despite our request for thorough investigation/measures to reduce the pain. He didn't prescribed any painkiller/medicine and now my wife is still facing the pain and traumatized by her experience.I will request the concerned people not to visit the doctor atleast in this clinic *** ** *** ****** ***** *** ********* ** ********** *** *** ** ****** ******* * **** ** ******************** ***** ******** ******* **** ****** ** **** *** ********** **** ** ****** **** **** ******** ***** *** **** ******** *********",

So what happened in between? Six months after that root canal, the crown came off. I do not live in the same city, so the next time I visited Kolkata, I went to him to get the crown fixed. He told me that the batch of glue he used was bad, which made sense because another family member who had visited him also had their crown come off. Dr. Bhattacharyya got me a new crown in 2015. \n\nOne year later, while chewing food, the crown came off again. This time, I texted him about what to do. He asked me to take the crown to a local dentist and get it fixed. So I did that. Only that my new dentist was shocked to see the condition of my tooth. The root canal was not done properly, and the infection had spread to the adjoining areas in these two years, causing the gums to inflame and the crown to pop out. It wasn't a bad batch of glue, it was my gum infection that made the crown come off. The damage was irreparable and the tooth needs to be extracted now. This isn't a wisdom tooth tucked in a corner of my mouth. **** ***** ******** ** ** *** *** * **** *** ************* *** *** ** * ****** *** ** * **** ****** ******* ** **** ********** ***** *** *** ***** ** ** ******* ***********\n\nI would not recommend Dr. Bhattacharyya to anyone, nor would I ever visit him again. I will not take the loss of a tooth lightly, since this was completely preventable. A very disappointing and painful experience.",

Then in between had gone to a couple of places only to come back in 2023 to his new South Kolkata clinic for a Re- RCT for a botched up work elsewhere.

From the moment we walked into the clinic, we felt welcomed and at ease, which is not something you typically associate with a dental visit.\n\nDr. Anirban demonstrated a high level of professionalism and took the time to thoroughly explain the procedures, the reasons for the ReRCT, and the expected outcomes, ensuring we were well-informed and comfortable throughout the entire process, instantly putting us at ease.\n\nWhat truly sets apart is his meticulous attention to detail and commitment to patient comfort. During both the RCT and ReRCT, both my wife and son experienced minimal discomfort and absolutely no pain. He answered all of our questions with patience, and we never felt rushed during any of our appointments.\n\nAdditionally, the clinic's facilities and warm atmosphere contributed to an overall positive experience. The staff at his clinic were friendly, efficient, and accommodating, making scheduling appointments and follow-up visits a breeze.\n\nI am pleased to report that the outcome of both my wife's and son's RCT/ReRCT exceeded our expectations. The dental crown was expertly fitted, with perfect color matching and the pain they were experiencing before the procedure has completely disappeared, and we are incredibly grateful to him for their expertise and dedication to oral health.\n\nThank you, Dr. Anirban, for your exceptional work and for making our dental visits comfortable and pain-free, especially within such a short time-frame as we had to return overseas. I will definitely be returning for all of our future dental needs!\n\nWarm regards, \nDilip Ray\n",

However, after filling, the problem didn't solved and we were forced to visit him in his own clinic due to uncertainity of his presence in the corona 2nd wave lockdown. At the time of visit, he directly said it needs RCT and that too on two teeth.After that, we told we will go for RCT for 1 tooth only which was causing much pain and will go for RCT on the 2nd one after the first one is completed and stabilized. Upon hearing this, the doctor was not amused and insisted for RCT on both despite both being on two different sides of the mouth. However, we told we will go for RCT in one side only and the same was carried out. Later, for crown placement, he insisted for PFM filling whereas we proposed for Zirconia (as she is allergic to almost all metals due to which she cannot keep jewellery for longer period of time). Upon this, the dentist was miffed and he insisted for PFM for which we clarified why we cannot take the PFM crown. He was constantly deriding us and later after a nearby deep filling during which gum was cut & bleeding, he insisted for mould fitting despite the gum was bleeding/hurt. He even flipped out against the patient as she was unable to provide enough pressure as she was hurt. Later, the filling was turning out to be painful and when we requested for sometime to heal for crown fitting, he was adamant that we should visit and will try to sort out the pain. However, during visit, he didn't cared much about pain and completed his crown fitting ** **** ** ***** ** **** *** ****** ********* ** **** ******** We told we will pay advance for crown but didn't want the same to placed that time but it fell on deaf ears.Now 1 month later, the pain didn't stopped and bad smell/some bluish stuff was seen in the operated area from naked eye. The same was conveyed to the dentist and he gave us appointment few days ago. However, during visit, he was rude/inconsiderate towards the issue told by the patient and was just trying to get rid of us despite our request for thorough investigation/measures to reduce the pain. He didn't prescribed any painkiller/medicine and now my wife is still facing the pain and traumatized by her experience.I will request the concerned people not to visit the doctor atleast in this clinic *** ** *** ****** ***** *** ********* ** ********** *** *** ** ****** ******* * **** ** ******************** ***** ******** ******* **** ****** ** **** *** ********** **** ** ****** **** **** ******** ***** *** **** ******** *********",

So what happened in between? Six months after that root canal, the crown came off. I do not live in the same city, so the next time I visited Kolkata, I went to him to get the crown fixed. He told me that the batch of glue he used was bad, which made sense because another family member who had visited him also had their crown come off. Dr. Bhattacharyya got me a new crown in 2015. \n\nOne year later, while chewing food, the crown came off again. This time, I texted him about what to do. He asked me to take the crown to a local dentist and get it fixed. So I did that. Only that my new dentist was shocked to see the condition of my tooth. The root canal was not done properly, and the infection had spread to the adjoining areas in these two years, causing the gums to inflame and the crown to pop out. It wasn't a bad batch of glue, it was my gum infection that made the crown come off. The damage was irreparable and the tooth needs to be extracted now. This isn't a wisdom tooth tucked in a corner of my mouth. **** ***** ******** ** ** *** *** * **** *** ************* *** *** ** * ****** *** ** * **** ****** ******* ** **** ********** ***** *** *** ***** ** ** ******* ***********\n\nI would not recommend Dr. Bhattacharyya to anyone, nor would I ever visit him again. I will not take the loss of a tooth lightly, since this was completely preventable. A very disappointing and painful experience.",

Then in between had gone to a couple of places only to come back in 2023 to his new South Kolkata clinic for a Re- RCT for a botched up work elsewhere.

(You can always visit the Apollo Dental\u2019s website for a snapshot of his professional achievements)\nYou will be surely moved by his deep integrity towards his profession and his keen interest to solve your issue, I mean to cure you, if you meet him. \nWhen we met for the first time, the first thing that I noticed was his exemplary confidence radiating from every word coming out of his mouth. It went a long way to alleviate my fear.\nAnd all that was proved when he very masterly solved my 4 years old tooth problem with all the diligence and care that exceeded my expectations compelling me to pen a few words about my experience with this extraordinary man.\nAnd, did I forget to mention that he would also be remembered as a man of very social demeanour.  \nI would like to end this note with my heartfelt thanks to Dr. Bhattacharya.

He have really amazing hands and experience. \n Most importantly he is a true professional. \nThis I should mention explicite as I had to complete the process in a time bound manner and on last day there was a small glitch on the crown. He managed his time to plan an additional visit to clinic and finish the process, as I had to travel out before any of his future schedule. \n\n Also we had amazing conversation on different topics which actually always helpful to get confidence and release stress of RCT treatment. \n\n",

I had extreme clarity on what is happening, how it is happening and by when it will be over.\nI was given complete information on various charges and also suggestions on what would be better.

In our first appt. we were impressed by the doctor's friendliness, understanding of the matter, knowledge and ability to give quick appts. My mother felt comfortable to proceed with Dr. Anirban. The surgeries went very smooth and painless, should have visited him before only. \n\nThank you Dr. Anirban B.",

Extremely hesitant to visit a non Indian doctor coupled with the fact that I was coming down anyway to Kolkata for a vacation, I got in touch with Dr. Bhattacharya. An amazing human who would put you in sheer comfort the moment you meet him - a glamorous smile and his huge experience as a dentist possibly gives him the confidence of making his patient feel so much at ease. He did my complex case so well - did not even feel a bit of pain. I will be indebted to him forever and will make it a point to visit him every time to ensure my own well being. Thank you Dr. Bhattacharya for the amazing doctor and human that you are. Difficult to find nowadays.

He was very reassuring and transparent with what I should expect throughout and I experienced no pain or discomfort at any point. \nDuring the entire procedure spanning 10 days, he was available at all times to answer any queries and offered to treat me even on his days off if a problem arose. He was also mindful to follow up on my condition over the next few weeks and months. \n\nI am very pleased with both the execution and results of my treatment and I highly recommend Dr Bhattacharyya!

Great and amazing doctor,  very friendly behaviour. Most importantly the way he treats the patient is great! Firstly he listens carefully, then diagnosis the problem and provides the solution. Well I had crown fixing, RCT treatment and some internal infection happened meanwhile. He treats all steps carefully, patiently and gives time to patients before proceeding to next step.  One more thing he makes small joke during the treatment time to keep patient tension free. It was absolute pleasure for me to receive painless treatment from great doctor. I recommend him 100% for any kind of dental issues. My heartfelt wishes for you in near future. ",
