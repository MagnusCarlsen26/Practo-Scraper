He followed a detailed methodological approach step by step towards diagnosis, medication and final decision about treatment. We were decided for RCT, but the tooth was not at the stage for doing that. So we went for extraction. Other than this, I did 6 fillings as well simultaneously.

The best thing about doctor Soumya is that, he educates you. At each step he is calm, patient, listening to the problem and explaining everything in detail to make you aware of the 'why'. He is also very rational and doesn't promote things which will not be useful for the patient.

All of this - his expertise, painless extraction, right medications, timely followups along with his friendliness and seamless communication from the reception...the entire experience was smooth.

I have not done implanting on the extracted tooth yet due to my relocation scenario, but there is no reason for others to not do it (if required).

Can vouch for him and his expertise. ***** ** **** ** **** *** *** *** **** ***** *** ** ***** ***** ******* ** ********* *** ** **** *** ******* ******** ********** ****** *** **** ***** **** * ************************************************",2023-11-10 16:38:03,False,True,Barshan Ghosal,Thank you ,2023-11-12T02:55:22+0000,Dr. Soumya Bandhopadhyay

This gives a 100% peace of mind that you are fully protected. Moreover the equipments being used are of latest technology and painless injection was used in my mouth which is just superb, everything fully sterilized. I didn't feel any pain for the tooth extraction and my overall experience was really good and I will recommend this clinic as 100% safe in this Covid situation.

I am staying outside the country and I am a NRI, I could easily compare them up to the mark of any international standard dental clinic.

Added to that the doctor seems to be not after money at all, the previous doctor said to do 7 root canals, Dr Soumya told me nothing required and he did a filling and some enamel treatment, I am perfectly fine now.

would strongly recommend this doctor doing such an ethical practice, and I he gave me his number saying that I can call him 24/7 post treatment.

Lastly I got the reference of Dr Soumya Bandyopadhyay from one of my friend. 
He had given me a beautiful solution. He was the first doctor who told my dad that fixed teeth are POSSIBLE with DENTAL IMPLANT. Though the cost of the treatment seemed to be little bit higher compare with the old false teeth we went for that.
Believe it or not Dr Soumya Bandyopadhyay has "" Hands of God""....He fixed 8 Dental Implants in my dad's  mouth,it was more than 3 hours operation but my father NEVER FELT ANY PAIN or ANY PROBLEM . Doctor has also fixed his teeth. 
Now my father is VERY VERY VERY HAPPY with this NEW FIXED TEETH, NOW he can EAT MUTTON as he used to be with his original teeth!!!! 
My dad is always blessing Dr Soumya Bandyopadhyay for his FANTASTIC WORK!!!

As he is ex-student of My School New Alipore Multipurpose and a member of our Alumni Association NAMSAA and as he is very junior to me I would call him Soumya for better bondage. When I came to meet him I was suffering from tremendous pain for toothache.His chember was well decorated with updated modern Clinical gadgates. Moreover he was very careful and prescribed medicines for the pain and I take a date in the comming week for root canel treatment.

Only thing I suggest about the availability of the medicine prescribed by him. It will be helpful if the medicines are made availableat Alipore Chetla area.

Root Canal Treatment is Amputation of the tooth nerve,  so like any other surgery, mild pain may occur after the treatment. Do warm saline mouth rinse and take some analgesics and come for a check up!

So, now,if you have any problem regarding your treatment please report it before online posting.  Repeating again this pain is very much normal.. I have rechecked your X Ray... Everything seems normal in the X Ray... So, don't worry... Come to the clinic for check up. 
I only came to know about your pain through online!!! It is the patient's responsibility to report to his/ her doctor first so that he can guide you properly and can take care of your problems.
