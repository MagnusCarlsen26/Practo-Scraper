"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Treatment,Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,NO,"Environment is good but issue is no one tells you the cost until u asked
I was there for my dental treatment and i was supposed to do RCT for number 7 and crowning for same tooth 
RCT price was 5500
Crowning price was 6500
Package is 12000
Which is way too much higher
I belong to Delhi and working in kolkata and done my RCT from there but while at crowning process doctor suggested me 8500 price crowning which has 5 years of warranty.
My concern was since the warranty is for kolkata state only why shouldn’t I have done it from my home town which will help me in future.
I told doctor and his helper this
Doctor agreed but while leaving they asked me to pay 2000 for Restoration charges which I don’t know why they charged
So total for my tooth I have paid 7500 still crowning is left
