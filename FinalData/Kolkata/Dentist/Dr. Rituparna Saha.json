The clinic is very hygienic and Dr Saha and her assistant undertake every required measure like, PPE kits, temperature checks, oxygen saturation test and sanitisation of the clinic equipment to ensure it\u2019s safe for everyone during these times.

She told me details how she will do it, the time she will take and also she told me the cost.I was surprised to note that her cost was very reasonable compared to other doctors I have visited earlier.

The clinic is very hygienic and Dr Saha and her assistant undertake every required measure like, PPE kits, temperature checks, oxygen saturation test and sanitisation of the clinic equipment to ensure it\u2019s safe for everyone during these times.
