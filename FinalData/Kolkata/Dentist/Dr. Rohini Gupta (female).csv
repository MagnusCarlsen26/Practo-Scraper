"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Scaling / Polishing,Broken Teeth,Cosmetic/ Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"Two of my front teeth got broken by an accident and I visited Dr Rohini Gupta for a reconstruction. She heard my problem patiently, checked my teeth and discssued the pros n cons of the treatment. Also, she gave me an estimate of the cost and the time required for the treatment beforehand. When I agreed to go ahead with the treatment, she gave me an appointment considering both of our convenience. I found the Dr. very cooperative and friendly. During the treatment, utmost care was taken for covid. She was very patient and meticulous throughout the process. At each step she made sure if I am comfortable. It took almost 1.30-2 hrs for teeth reconstruction with scaling and polishing. She didn't hurry at all. The finishing was so good that its impossible to differentiate between the artificial and the real part. She asked me if any modifications needed, and when I requested minor changes she did it promptly. Overall I am highly impressed by the quality of treatment and more importantly by the hassle free feel good process. You can trust Dr Gupta blindly for any dental issues. Highly recommended.

The clinic was previously located in the kawlity market. ,2020-03-08 03:14:17,False,False,Vk singh,"We do not charge 5000 for a filling..it was a Root Canal treatment which is always advised by every dentist to be followed by a crown..
As you have mentioned, the tooth was treated years back and not being covered by a crown, there are high chances of breakage or material loss. No follow up from the patient further worsens the situation. We would still request you to visit the clinic to see if the tooth can still be saved.
