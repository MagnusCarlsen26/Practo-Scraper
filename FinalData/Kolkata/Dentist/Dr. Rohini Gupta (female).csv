She heard my problem patiently, checked my teeth and discssued the pros n cons of the treatment. Also, she gave me an estimate of the cost and the time required for the treatment beforehand. When I agreed to go ahead with the treatment, she gave me an appointment considering both of our convenience. I found the Dr. very cooperative and friendly. During the treatment, utmost care was taken for covid. She was very patient and meticulous throughout the process. At each step she made sure if I am comfortable. It took almost 1.30-2 hrs for teeth reconstruction with scaling and polishing. She didn't hurry at all. The finishing was so good that its impossible to differentiate between the artificial and the real part. She asked me if any modifications needed, and when I requested minor changes she did it promptly. Overall I am highly impressed by the quality of treatment and more importantly by the hassle free feel good process. You can trust Dr Gupta blindly for any dental issues. Highly recommended.

None,"Fractured Tooth,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Rohini Gupta with a severely infected fractured Root Canal Tooth on Tuesday 13th March.
I had immense pain since few days. Was on antibiotic course already but infection still persisted.
I was not able to manage without periodic painkillers. She did immediate assessment of my tooth and suggested extraction of the same as Re-RCT would not work considering the condition of the tooth.
Next day Dr. Rohini Gupta and Dr. Anuj both extracted my tooth. The extraction was pretty critical and involved minor surgery. With immense patience both of them made this happen.
After the surgery I visited them thrice for follow up on post operative healing , and both of them always were available and helped me with necessary support. In spite of there being rush in the clinic both of them are way too good in managing time and availability for their patients. Reasonable with charges, expert in their work and amicable in their behaviour, both are helping me sway through this tough phase of mine and now I am healing.

It was indeed disappointing to read your feedback.Afterthe root canal treatment was completed, since the tooth had a periapical infection, I had specifically asked you to return for crowning a month later after a period of follow up which u did not abide by. When you reported next , I found the tooth had fractured and we could extract it with great difficulty. It took great effort to get the fractured pieces out part by part and inspite of it we charged you a fraction of the normal surgical extraction charges because you agreed that there was a misunderstanding regarding the crown placement following RCT .
Since the extraction was difficult, sutures were placed  and all required medications were prescribed..when you  called to ask for solution regarding bleeding after surgery, I explained that a difficult surgery might follow light bleeding and yet added some more medication as per your request. You need to understand that doctors don't prescribe medication unless the situation requires and that is why the patients are duly noted to  call if any such situation arises.
However if you have any other grievance you are most welcome to address your concerns with us.
