           first of all when you are posting your feedback, please at-least mention your name. 

Secondly, In our setup, once you have consulted the  doctor then only you are sent to the assistant for discussing the treatment duration and cost. There again the assistant will help you to understand the treatment plan given by doctor and if you had any doubt then you could have asked the doctor to clarify. Especially for cosmetic dental treatment , there are so many options available, it‚Äôs difficult to understand and even explain in 15 minutes time for consultation given by Practo. 

There would have been other patients waiting in queue to get consultation and start the dental procedure plus we have other branches to maintain and we have to maintain timing for all the other patients who are booking via practo.
