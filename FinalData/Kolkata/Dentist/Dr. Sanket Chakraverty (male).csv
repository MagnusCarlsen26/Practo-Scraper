Dr. Arimeeta checked my Teeth on the first day and recommended the line of treatment. My affected tooth was duly extracted the next day and measurements taken for cantilever dental bridge.
Subsequently, Dr. Sanket checked my teeth, made adjustments to the nearby teeth for the bridge to be implanted later, and suggested that I go for a bridge made of DMLS material for stability and longevity.
The bridge was finally implanted yesterday and has been stable so far.

But they truly lived up to it when we experienced them first hand. 
First of a big shoutout to Dr. Sanket, Dr. Arimeeta and the nurses there! You might have had several dentist horror stories but not here I promise you! 
I was very worried about my mom, she had complete tooth extraction and dentures done. 
In our first visit Dr. Sanket actually took a good 30-40mins to explain every detail and answer all our doubts and queries. His assurance and care for his patients actually gave us the confidence to go ahead with it. 
Once the treatment started, Dr. Arimeeta did the extractions for my mom. She's very empathetic towards her patients *** *** ** ********* ******* ***** my mom felt zero pain in process.
Then onward, for every sitting as I would be at work, my mom who is 50+ in age, would go alone all by herself, as they literally took care of her, they were very warm and friendly and that gave her immense confidence. 
All procedures were done with ease. The extractions were painless. They take care not to hurt you or make you uncomfortable at all. People warned us that extractions are painful but it was nothing like that for us there. 
Lastly the dentures my mom received were so natural that it literally amazed our friends and family. 
So now of late, my brother took very bad, the first person my mom called was Dr. Sanket and he took the efforts to come down early that day. My brother is undergoing RCT there now, and in his verdict, this is the best doctor he has visited :) 

In my experience:
- The Doctors: very patient, empathetic and extremely understanding towards their patients. Even the nurses there are very patient, soft spoken and friendly. They genuinely do care for their patients! 
- Premium service (they will never do something just for the money, when they carry out something you are guaranteed the best) 
- Clean and Calm clinic, very hygienic procedures
- Hassle free processes
- Very skilled Doctors
- Painless! (Even the RCT for my brother is painless!) 
- Located well on the main road. 
- Value for money
- Very ethical

Am not usually very easily impressed, but their service, the assurance and guidance during the challenging situation was so helpful that it I've recommended them to our relatives out of station as well. 

If you are looking to see a dentist, go ahead and give them a try. You can surely trust them.

Let me share my recent experience here with. I had a broken tooth in front and had a RCT being done couple of years back. But the crown has come out a few months back and I needed to fix it.

I still remember the first day I visited the clinic, both Dr. Sanket and Dr. Arimeeta explained me in detail, with illustrations, what are the feasible options I had. Gave a detail cost breakup and the entire detail.

So I choose a treatment [Re-RCT + Ceramic crowning with a post] that suited my needs well and as per the doc recommendation. One notable thing about the payment is they do accept cards / paytm and that they dont charge you any hidden cost. So for a cashless prefering guy like me, it was a cool thing. It cost me a total of 8000 bucks - that was exactly the estimate provided to me in the beginning of the treatment.

I had gone through 5 seatings. You always would have a slot pre-booked by practo. The day when there would be an appointment, you would get a reminder message in the morning - that was very useful for me to plan the rest of my day. Please maintain the time slots or you will cause disturbance to both yours and their schedule. In case of any discrepancy, please call them up and reschedule it.

During this all, one really good stuff I liked about Dr. Sanket was his passion. Man we all earn money in our profession. But he was a person I have seen fighting for the last bits of perfection. As I said I had some prior experience with other dentist before too, but the passion he has for his work is something praiseworthy. I remember, while there was some filling in tooth going on(forgive me I am no good in medical terms and just trying to put some words in layman`s note), he did kept on doing the stuff, validated it with an x-ray and kept on doing so unless he felt it perfect. 

Guys, today was the final day. I am indeed very happy with the pleasant experience.

Please feel free to give a call to the clinic in case you are planning for a dental check-up. The supportive staffs were very cooperative and cordial too.

I highly recommend the Dr. Sanket and Dr. Arimeeta, in case of any dental problems. I will share some pics I had clicked - as I was very curious to see what was happening in my teeth while he was burning the gum tissues with a laser. ***** ** ** *** * ***** ******* ************",2017-03-22 17:38:01,False,True,Ayan Ghatak,Thank you sir for your feedback.,2017-04-07T04:49:01+0000,Dr. Sanket Chakraverty

           first of all when you are posting your feedback, please at-least mention your name. 

Secondly, In our setup, once you have consulted the  doctor then only you are sent to the assistant for discussing the treatment duration and cost. There again the assistant will help you to understand the treatment plan given by doctor and if you had any doubt then you could have asked the doctor to clarify. Especially for cosmetic dental treatment , there are so many options available, it‚Äôs difficult to understand and even explain in 15 minutes time for consultation given by Practo. 

There would have been other patients waiting in queue to get consultation and start the dental procedure plus we have other branches to maintain and we have to maintain timing for all the other patients who are booking via practo.
