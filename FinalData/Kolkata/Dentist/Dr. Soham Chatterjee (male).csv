You wanted us to give you good work at a very minimal charge as per your liking which is not possible as we do send work to one of the premium labs in the country and every work is being done by specialists to give you the best results. We also still tried our best to help you by not charging you for the xray and also giving you discounts from our side which we dont usually do. You did love our work when we showed you our previous patient results. The charges you bargained for is not acceptable to our work quality and standards. We are there to help you out nonetheless. We do our best to do help our patients, but there has to be a limit. It's also unfair to the doctors when patient's put us down because of unfair requests such as this.
