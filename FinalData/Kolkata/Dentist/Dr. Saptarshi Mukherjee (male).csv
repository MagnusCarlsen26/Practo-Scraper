But let me get a few facts straight with you before your nonchalantly defame our clinic. 
You came to us because you had pain or is it you thought we provide head massages here?
You had a condition and we tried our best to repair the damages you already came with.
We tried to save your tooth before doing RCT which would have let your tooth dead. The infection was bad enough for the treatment to not work. For which you were not charged. Do you had a free treatment which you are complaining about.
Now after the 2nd sitting you had no pain as you reported on watsapp. This review is after your 2nd sitting btw.
No comes the cost part.
Your brother who is an old patient of mine called and confirmed my charges before you came into our clinic for the treatment and you were fine with it as well.
Now I remember you being furious on him for paying the consulting charge of Rs. 500 which he missed to mention to you. I have that on watsapp as well.
All I can say is that we dont work magic spells here as doctor. We try to cure whats ailing in you.
It takes time to heal. You did not damage your tooth in 1 day, how do you expect it to be fine in a day or two.
Losing temper is your condition as mentioned by your brother as well. Please dont use it in an inappropriate manner. As far as I remember you went out happy with the treatment. If it was for the Rs.500 extra for consultation you had to pay, I am sorry it was such a huge loss for you to pay a doctor his visiting fees.
I mentioned it to your brother that it will be refunded to you as and when you wish for it. 
Thank you for visiting though.
