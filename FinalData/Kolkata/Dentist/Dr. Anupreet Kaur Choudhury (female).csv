"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Tooth Decay,",0,0,YES,"I used to dread dental visits after a harrowing root canal experience with a different dentist. 

Determined to avoid any more dental appointments, I endured months of increasing sensitivity and pain in my premolar teeth. Eventually, a sizable cavity emerged, signaling the urgent need for professional care.

Despite initial hesitation, I sought out Dr. Anupreet Kaur Choudhury in Kolkata, driven by her stellar reviews. On a Sunday, with heightened pain due to the cold weather, I discovered her clinic, impeccably clean and adhering to COVID protocols. Dr. Kaur's warm demeanor immediately eased my fears.

After explaining my dental woes, she conducted a thorough examination, revealing cavities and a misaligned wisdom tooth causing the pain. Despite my apprehensions from a past root canal, Dr. Kaur patiently addressed each query, explaining the necessary procedures and reassuring me. Encouraged by her confidence, I decided to proceed with a root canal.

To my surprise, the treatments were swift, spanning three sessions of 15-25 minutes each. Dr. Kaur, alongside Dr. Sumit and Dr. Gopal, exhibited expertise and care throughout, erasing my fears. The post-treatment phase was equally comforting, with no pain or discomfort, allowing me to resume normal eating habits.

In reflecting on this experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kaur and her team to anyone seeking a reliable dentist.
