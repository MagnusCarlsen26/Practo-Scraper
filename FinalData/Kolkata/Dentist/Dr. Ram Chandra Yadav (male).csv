As far as your treatment is concerned, you were advised to undergo scaling as well as extraction. As you were about to travel, you refused to undergo extraction at that point, opting for scaling only. As you had come with toothache a prescription of antibiotics and painkillers were given. Also OPG X-Ray  was advised. You had also cancelled a further follow up appointment and had said you will reschedule. Hopefully once you are back we can schedule an appointment to complete your treatment. Take care.",2015-12-08T15:04:37+0000,Dr. Ram Chandra Yadav
