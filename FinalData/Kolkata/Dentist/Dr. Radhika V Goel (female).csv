Sorry as we are to learn that you feel this way, we do appreciate you taking the time to give us this feedback!

Perhaps this rather Rare opinion stems from some sort of a misunderstanding, something for which we are very apologetic!

After all, thousands of patient's, (over more than a decade), couldn't all have been wrong all the time!

Our patients are from the whole cross-section of our society, be they college students, or retired govt. servants, or housewives, or businesspeople, or service personnel. This is obviously something we are deeply proud of!!

We believe in not bargaining with our patient's health and so we do not bargain with the quality of our care.

We also realized early on that the size of one's wallet has nothing to do with how beautiful one's healthy smile is! 

That is why we offer many Zero Interest payment plans, often spanning over several months, to many who are desirous of availing such facilities.

We are greatful you considered us and appreciate your trust in the quality of our care! 🙏

We look forward to seeing your happy smile again!

Regards,
TeamDentotsav🙂
