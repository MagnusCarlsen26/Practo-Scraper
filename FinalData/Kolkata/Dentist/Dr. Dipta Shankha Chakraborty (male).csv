,,0,0,YES,"I have recently consulted Dr. Dipta for bridge replacement. My old bridge(front) was made of Metal Ceramic and I had a very bad experience with that. Before meeting Dr. Dipta , I thought that removing old bridge might damage my supporting tooth. But, it went smoothly and it took only 15 min to remove the old one.                                     Then, he suggested me to go with Zirconia bridge as currently Zirconia is best for bridge. On first day, old bridge got removed and tooth impression is taken. Our next appointment was after 2 days and it was basically a trail day, in which they check if everything is fine. If any modifications needed, then they sent bridge to lab. But in my case, it didn't need any modifications. So overall it took 4 days. I really want to thank Dr.  Dipta  and his entire supporting staff for their service .",2020-06-05 07:57:56,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
