The outcomes are fantastic.\n\nI was struck by Dr. Tiwari's team's warmth and professionalism as soon as I entered his office. Every time I went, they made me feel welcome and well-cared for. Being the epitome of professionalism, Dr. Tiwari always took the time to thoroughly explain each procedure, making sure I understood it and felt comfortable.\n\nThe precision with which he carried out each extraction, root canal, and filling speaks volumes about his skill and knowledge. I had very little discomfort during the complicated treatments because of Dr. Tiwari's careful attention to detail and kind demeanor. The results have greatly improved my teeth's appearance and function, surpassing my expectations.\n\nDr. Aditya Tiwari is the ideal option if you're looking for a dentist who combines technical skill with true compassion for his patients. I express my gratitude to Dr. Tiwari and your committed team for delivering exceptional healthcare.\"\n",

At Tooth and Braces, we value all our patients and take their concerns seriously.\n\nYou visited us with a severe infection in the wisdom tooth region, accompanied by noticeable facial swelling. We prescribed antibiotics and advised tooth removal. The antibiotics given were standard and necessary for your condition. It's important to understand that these medications need time to work, Patience is key for the medicines to take effect. We are doctors not magicians\n\nRegarding your comment on my attitude and rude behaviour, I want to clarify that I do not enjoy being rude or stern with any patient. However, your behavior towards our staff was completely unacceptable. At Tooth and Braces, the respect and dignity of our staff are of utmost importance. We rely on our dedicated team to provide the best care possible. The way you spoke to our staff in the clinic and during subsequent phone call was highly inappropriate.\n\nWe wish we could share the call recordings of the conversations to provide context and clarity on the matter and to prove how the way you spoke was unacceptable. we wish there was a way to review verified patients just like they review us. Despite the challenges, we sincerely wish you good health and hope you find a dentist whose attitude meets your expectations.\n\nBest regards,\nTooth and Braces",

Being the epitome of professionalism, Dr. Tiwari always took the time to thoroughly explain each procedure, making sure I understood it and felt comfortable.\n\nThe precision with which he carried out each extraction, root canal, and filling speaks volumes about his skill and knowledge. I had very little discomfort during the complicated treatments because of Dr. Tiwari's careful attention to detail and kind demeanor. The results have greatly improved my teeth's appearance and function, surpassing my expectations.\n\nDr. Aditya Tiwari is the ideal option if you're looking for a dentist who combines technical skill with true compassion for his patients.

At Tooth and Braces, we value all our patients and take their concerns seriously.\n\nYou visited us with a severe infection in the wisdom tooth region, accompanied by noticeable facial swelling. We prescribed antibiotics and advised tooth removal. The antibiotics given were standard and necessary for your condition. It's important to understand that these medications need time to work, Patience is key for the medicines to take effect. We are doctors not magicians\n\nRegarding your comment on my attitude and rude behaviour, I want to clarify that I do not enjoy being rude or stern with any patient. However, your behavior towards our staff was completely unacceptable. At Tooth and Braces, the respect and dignity of our staff are of utmost importance. We rely on our dedicated team to provide the best care possible. The way you spoke to our staff in the clinic and during subsequent phone call was highly inappropriate.\n\nWe wish we could share the call recordings of the conversations to provide context and clarity on the matter and to prove how the way you spoke was unacceptable. we wish there was a way to review verified patients just like they review us. Despite the challenges, we sincerely wish you good health and hope you find a dentist whose attitude meets your expectations.\n\nBest regards,\nTooth and Braces",

She also paid attention to even small reactions and made sure to put me at ease even when there was the slightest discomfort. Dr. Tiwary treated the sensitivity issue and made sure that I was comfortable both during and after the procedure. He also explained the post treatment care in detail. The procedures were executed with great care and precision. The facility is hygienically maintained and utmost degree of professional standards. The staff was well trained. ",
