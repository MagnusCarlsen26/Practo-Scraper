But right after rct, I had so much pain for first week and was feeling uncomfortable, I have visited clinic 3-4 times, everytime she has done xray, and told me everything is fine, then she grinded other teeth on my compliant, but she did nothing about my wisdom tooth pain, this pain u have tolerated for almost 7-8 months by thinking may be because healing will take time. But finally i have visited Cmc Vellore, they have done full mouth xray and told tooth is in very bad situation, immediately extraction is required, then I have visited some other specialist in bangalore, everyone recommend immediate extraction, and has also told that situation is that bad, that no one can guarantee proper healing as rct has created too much infection in gums.  Now my tooth is extracted, but still infection doesn't go away, and doctors are suggesting surgery in case infection prevails.
