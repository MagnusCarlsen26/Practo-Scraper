He has almost charged me double for cap. He showed there are multiple warranty *** *** *** ***** ** ******* **** **** ** Do not go on his sweet words and his scientific explanation.
For one zirconium cap of dent care he has charged me 14k, outside it will come for 7-9k. 
Plus he has done filling in other tooth saying this is very much required. These fillings came out in a month only. He will put blam e  on the patient only. 
Just today I got to know the court has asked to discontinue the warranty on cap.
