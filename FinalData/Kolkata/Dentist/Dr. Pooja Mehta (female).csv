None,None,0,0,YES,"I've been procrastinating going to the dentist for the longest time, and one of the main gripes from my previous experience was the unhealthy dose of patronising that came with elder/senior doctors. This time I researched a little bit, and found out about Dr. Mehta and Dr. Tiwary ar Tooth and Braces Dental Clinic. And am I glad I went there- thoroughly professional, supportive , kind and down-to-earth team. They did a detailed examination at first, explained everything that was wrong and what needs to be done on priority basis, and even asked if I have any preference on how to go about it- I was floored at the experience. Never thought I would one day gladly be going to the dentist! They took in to consideration my limited time in the city, and arranged an efficient timetable to make the most of my time, as well as getting all the necessary treatment done. All this for a very competitive rate- I couldn't be happier. I wish them all the very best, and I'm sure they'll end up being the top dental practices in the city very soon. Highly recommended!",2022-03-06 05:57:32,False,True,Sayan Deb Sinha,,,
