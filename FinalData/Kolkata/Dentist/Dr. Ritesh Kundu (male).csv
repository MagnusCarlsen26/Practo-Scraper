When I finally visited Dr. Kundu I was extremely relieved to know the problem. Dr. Kundu made sure that I understand the problem and the root cause of the ache. He gives ample time to each of his patients. My one tooth needed a filling, which he did. One remarkable aspect of Dr. Kundu needs to be mentioned. My other tooth was bit critical. Of course an RCT is a solution, but also expensive. So he first tried with a filling, so that the treatment gets economical for me, but when the filling didn't work, he did the RCT, but adjusted the fee for the fillling! This is what I really liked about him. Unlike many doctors, he really thinks about the money aspect from the patient point of view. Coming to the surgery, he is immensely expert at his job. I wish I could show my tooth cap. There was no pain at all throughout the process. And the cap is so nicely made and fit  even I cannot make out which one is original and which one is the cap. Not to forget, the comfort of the cap, which feels like a natural teeth.
