"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Paediatric Critical Care,Fever,",0,0,NO,"I had very bad experience with him. I would never recommend anyone to visit him. I had visited to him at ILS Hospital Saltlake Kolkata for treatment of my 2 yrs old son suffering with high fever. While meeting with him in his chamber, my son got fibral convulsion and he immediately advised for admit. On the moment I agreed for admission. He prescribed some medicine and went away. Rather  than explaining any thing about the fibral convulsion that why it came, he humiliated us and attitude was not good. He prescribed some test. While taking the blood sample from son nurses not obtained the sample properly and blown some blood on the bed. Even not handled the sample properly and it got clot. Hence pathologist again wanted to take out the blood from my son. Seeing such thing I refused to admit. When I consulted the doctor he himself says dont come again to meet with me. This attitude was very bad.  When I came next day with the report he was not ready to see the blood test report. Even while calling for appointment & seeing the report he cut the call without answering.  Every time we have to pay 800 for his appointment even for seeing the report. Even no other doctor of the hospital ready to see the report. Hence I had very bad experience with DR Rajesh Goyal & ILS Hospital Salt Lake both while my first visit to the doctor & hospital.",2018-09-11 04:56:08,False,False,Pankaj kumar,,,

"Wait time,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,NO,"Doctors can come in late as they are very busy so ignoring this concern even though we visited him for a new born
He didn't even check the baby's health once. The moment I started asking questions he started complaining what all things we are doing wrong. Not sure how and why he wrote baby has clear chest while she was coughing and had congestion. 
He shut mothers mouth by asking her to feed the child there . Child was cold but he insisted that we don't over insulate the baby. He didn't even hear child had cold problems earlier and forced us to remove her wrapper. Baby was cold and syarted crying but doctor insisted it was because she was hungry. Because of this baby has again fallen sick after doc visit.
Mothers can say most about a baby's problems but he doesn't even allow mother's to speak. Just forces his opinion on patient party.",2018-01-03 01:28:44,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
