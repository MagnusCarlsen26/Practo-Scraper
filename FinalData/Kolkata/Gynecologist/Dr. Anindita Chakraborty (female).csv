"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,**** **** ****** *** very good behaviour. During the whole pregnancy period of my wife she guided us like a senior family member and till end time provided her support. Whenever we called her over phone she picked up and replied.
