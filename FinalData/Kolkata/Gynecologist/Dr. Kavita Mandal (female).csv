Just wanted to share my story. We had a mis-carriage last year and my wife was mentally very upset & afraid. The previous doctor was not bad though but somehow I got the feeling that he was very outdated. My wife needed special care. Thinking into all these aspects I googled out for the best Doctors in Kolkata and it suggested the name of Dr. Kavita Mandal. It also showed she was in AIIMS Delhi earlier. As I had spent 17 years of my youth in Delhi and had encountered many successful treatment cases in AIIMS including my father & aunt, I knew what it is all about.

We consulted Dr. Kavita Mandal and told her everything about our past mis-carriage and that we wanted to plan again fresh. Right from the scratch, she provided excellent guidance about the hows-whats-whens to plan. My wife was mentally very upset but on following her easy guidelines, she successfully conceived again.

Thereafter, it was a continuous chain of visits, approximately but not limited to once in a month visit. I could see that my wife was gaining her confidence back again this time. I told the doctor that we are surrendering ourselves completely to you and in turn she took it up and did not disappoint us.

Her nature is very good. She always acted normally provided us with the ease of sharing with her anything that we thought important. Never did she try or say anything that would make us afraid or bother. She kept everything so simple, yet I could feel that things are working out.

Additionally, my friend & his wife were also seeking her treatment as she was also expecting. Her expected date was 1 month later.
Finally, the day arrived and she said that she will hand our treasure to us which she did. We were blessed with a healthy baby girl on 14-May-2021. I was happy for my wife as I could see her behaving normally again. I got everything back whatever I had lost last year.

Additionally, my friend's wife, unfortunately, her sack started leaking the day our baby was born. They thought it was the end and were very sad. But, Dr. Kavita told us not to worry again. Behaving normally, she came to the rescue and successfully operated her and they were blessed with a baby boy just the very next day on 15-May-2021. Even though it was premature but with her guidance and proper treatment, the baby is in good shape and condition today after 2 months of delivery and is completely normal.

We both the families are indebted to her for her smart, simple and successful treatment. Today we are both happy families because of her. I am proud my decision that I selected her. 

If you ask me, she is the ONE and only that I will recommend every time. Her success rate seems to be 100%. Thank you doctor for everything.",2021-07-01 13:41:05,False,True,Verified Patient,Thanks n take care,2021-07-02T09:13:29+0000,Dr. Kavita Mandal

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Had a highly satisfying and pleasant experience of our pregnancy journey under Dr Kavita's consultation. We started consulting her when my wife was in the third trimester. Each time we went to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She payed attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity, Analysed all our reports from scratch since we were on-boarded late( i still remember she spent 20min in our first visit to go through the old reports). As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions and issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding. Coming to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. She visited us daily when my wife was admitted in hospital. Even in the OT she was consoling my wife, who was under the panic of C-Section. Blessed with a princess on 25th Aug. We thank you, Dr. Kavita, for a wonderful experience.

We started consulting her when my wife was in the third trimester. Each time we went to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She payed attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity, Analysed all our reports from scratch since we were on-boarded late( i still remember she spent 20min in our first visit to go through the old reports). As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions and issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding. Coming to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. She visited us daily when my wife was admitted in hospital. Even in the OT she was consoling my wife, who was under the panic of C-Section. Blessed with a princess on 25th Aug. We thank you, Dr. Kavita, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything.We strongly recommend her.

In one of my normal checkups in 31st week, my amniotic fluid level came on the lower side though the usg report said adequate fluid. Doctor told us to repeat USG every week since if the fluid level drops more, we have to do pre term delivery. We were horribly tensed but doctor kept assuring us that the baby will be fine but we may have to keep the baby in NICU for 3-4 weeks. Next week in repeat USG, my fluid level dropped further and she took an immediate decision to do c- section next day on 32.4 weeks. She sensed that we are extremely worried and constantly counselled and assured us. She did an amazing C-section which healed in a week and left almost zero scar. In the OT also she was constantly calming me. I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl, thankfully she didn't require NICU and was released in just 8 days from special care from Bhagirathi Neotia.
