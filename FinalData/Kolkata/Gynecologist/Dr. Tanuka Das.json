Not only has she taken great care of my daughter's health who was her patient but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. She explained everything to my daughter in a very clear manner. Dr Tanuka Dasgupta is really godsent. She is a wonderful surgeon. She operated on my daughter with a huge ovarian cyst through laparoscopy which other doctors suggested open one. With her blessings my daughter recovered quickly. My sincere gratitude to her and feel fortunate to have chose her. We would highly recommend her to anyone.",
