"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI),",0,0,YES,"Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta is the reason of our happiness after spending years of sleepless nights. We tried for IVF-ICSI which failed for the first time, but we never lost hope on the doctor. We attempted for IVF again under him and on 6th Nov 2023, we were blessed with a baby boy.

We started the treatment under Dr. Dasgupta during the starting of 2022. He shared the pros and cons of all treatment procedures and presented us the choices for IUI and IVF. His detailed information, especially considering my advanced maternal age, helped us to opt for IVF. He also shared a book authored by him regarding details of IVF pregnancy during the visit which clarified almost all the doubts and any questions that we had.

The second IVF attempt was progressing smoothly till ovum pickup. We were planning to freeze the embryo and plan for pregnancy later, but doctor suggested for immediate Embryo Transfer within 3 days of pickup, considering the quality of the embryo and the history of the failure of embryo formation during the first attempt. Despite the sudden pregnancy decision was hard to take still we decided to trust him. The pregnancy progressed smoothly till 3rd trimester, although low PAPP-A was detected in NT scan (signifying the growth restriction of placenta). The baby was detected with late onset IUGR in the early 3rd trimester. My son was even not required to be admitted in NICU and stayed with me throughout the hospitalization.

He is a patient centric doctor who also considers the financial aspects of his patients, which proved to be more helpful to us as we are from a middle class background. Throughout the journey, he explained the pros and cons of most of the medicines and the treatment transparently, never hiding any facts.

Many times we have seen the second semen analysis report is completely different. 
In any infertility clinic of the World, both husband and wife need to come together. Even if there is problem in husband's sperm only, the wife need to be seen by the infertility specialist who will discuss the treatment ONLY after seeing reports of both. In our centre, the charge Rs 1200 includes 
1. Consultation charges for both husband and wife 
2. Psychological counseling, which is mandatory for any infertility clinic as per Govt of India 
3. TVS ultrasound for wife.
You paid the charge and we offered you all these but you refused treatment and any test for your wife.
You wanted to act very smart and you thought only your report will be checked. Medicine practice has its rule and you can NOT change the way of treatment. We requested you to do evaluation of your wife which would have been done without spending anything extra. But you refused that. You repeatedly insisted on medicines. Before giving any medicine we need to see whether medicine is actually needed. But you were very much stubborn and you thought you know everything of infertility treatment. 
We are thankful that our patients rely completely on us when they come to our clinic.

Regarding your problem our Dr already reassured you that you did not have any big problem and advised some tests.
Then you showed tests and medicines advised by other doctors and asked for opinion on it. Nobody can judge the prescription of another doctor. We can not comment on tests advised by other doctors.
Even finally he requested that he was having an emergency (because we cannot endanger other patient's life when that patient requires URGENT medical attention). But you repeatedly asked to know the SPELLING OF EACH TEST advised by the doctor. The tests were clearly written in prescription and it did not require the doctor to spell the name of each test.
Therefore in future when you visit any doctor, please remember,
1) all patients may not get equal time in consultation. The time depends on the severity of the problem patient is suffering.
2) don't compete with other patients regarding time
3) don't ask the doctor to judge the prescription of another doctor. (You purposefully avoided explanation of this).

We went to a renowned gynaecologist of Kolkata to resolve the issue. But the Doctor gave us very little time in each seating and it seemed that the problem, whatever it is with me, remained unsolved after more than a year. Then a colleague of my husband suggested us about Dr Sujoy Dasgupta (from now on, I will address him as 'Sir'). We visited Sir at Garia, Friends Diagnostics. From the first day, Sir was very supportive and thorough, he consulted with us like a friend, giving all the possible options. The problem for which I was unable to conceive till that time, was identified by Sir within a week. After then, following his advice, I became pregnant which was an amazing experience. 
As my hometown is Krishnanagar, we could not visit Sir after lockdown, but he was always there whenever we required advices. I am unfortunate that I was unable to have Sir beside me during the most important incident of my life, due to pandemic situation, but I know it is his blessings that leads us to our parenthood.
