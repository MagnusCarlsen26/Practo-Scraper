"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI),",0,0,YES,"Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta is the reason of our happiness after spending years of sleepless nights. We tried for IVF-ICSI which failed for the first time, but we never lost hope on the doctor. We attempted for IVF again under him and on 6th Nov 2023, we were blessed with a baby boy.

We started the treatment under Dr. Dasgupta during the starting of 2022. He shared the pros and cons of all treatment procedures and presented us the choices for IUI and IVF. His detailed information, especially considering my advanced maternal age, helped us to opt for IVF. He also shared a book authored by him regarding details of IVF pregnancy during the visit which clarified almost all the doubts and any questions that we had.

The second IVF attempt was progressing smoothly till ovum pickup. We were planning to freeze the embryo and plan for pregnancy later, but doctor suggested for immediate Embryo Transfer within 3 days of pickup, considering the quality of the embryo and the history of the failure of embryo formation during the first attempt. Despite the sudden pregnancy decision was hard to take still we decided to trust him. The pregnancy progressed smoothly till 3rd trimester, although low PAPP-A was detected in NT scan (signifying the growth restriction of placenta). The baby was detected with late onset IUGR in the early 3rd trimester. My son was even not required to be admitted in NICU and stayed with me throughout the hospitalization.

He is a patient centric doctor who also considers the financial aspects of his patients, which proved to be more helpful to us as we are from a middle class background. Throughout the journey, he explained the pros and cons of most of the medicines and the treatment transparently, never hiding any facts.

We have seen many doctors but no one is like Dr Sujoy Dasgupta. He does not prescribe useless medicines and never asks for unnecessary testings. We were married for 3 years but never enjoyed our conjugal life due to erectile dysfunction of my hubby. He consulted many doctors but all were in vain. Finally when we planned to have a baby, it was found that I had PCOS problems. Many doctors prescribed numerous tests and medicines but nothing worked. Even somebody advised us test tube baby. Nobody addressed our issue properly. So we lost all hopes to conceive naturally. We consulted Dr Dasgupta at his Garia chamber as a last chance. On first consultation he discussed many issues giving us almost 45 minutes time. He prescribed drugs and some exercises to my husband, which worked like magic within few days. His performance improved a lot. He advised me few tests and gave much emphasis on weight loss (which nobody advised before). He said ""I am not God. I cannot give you guarantee. But I can try my level best to make you smile. But I do not give false assurance"". He kept his promises. By God's grace we conceived naturally within 3 months of his consultation. That time he was also beside us. Throughout my pregnancy, whenever I felt any problem I gave his a ring, even if it was midnight. he never felt disturbed and talked to me in gentle way.

Moreover, scientifically, a single semen analysis is not at all reliable and no treatment can be done based on a single semen analysis. Therefore, it is always advisable to do semen analysis from infertility laboratory to confirm whether it is actually good or bad. Many times we have seen the second semen analysis report is completely different. 
In any infertility clinic of the World, both husband and wife need to come together. Even if there is problem in husband's sperm only, the wife need to be seen by the infertility specialist who will discuss the treatment ONLY after seeing reports of both. In our centre, the charge Rs 1200 includes 
1. Consultation charges for both husband and wife 
2. Psychological counseling, which is mandatory for any infertility clinic as per Govt of India 
3. TVS ultrasound for wife.
You paid the charge and we offered you all these but you refused treatment and any test for your wife.
You wanted to act very smart and you thought only your report will be checked. Medicine practice has its rule and you can NOT change the way of treatment. We requested you to do evaluation of your wife which would have been done without spending anything extra. But you refused that. You repeatedly insisted on medicines. Before giving any medicine we need to see whether medicine is actually needed. But you were very much stubborn and you thought you know everything of infertility treatment. 
We are thankful that our patients rely completely on us when they come to our clinic.

Some patients need extra time (even an hour) while in some other cases the consultation can be completed within 5 minutes.
Regarding your problem our Dr already reassured you that you did not have any big problem and advised some tests.
Then you showed tests and medicines advised by other doctors and asked for opinion on it. Nobody can judge the prescription of another doctor. We can not comment on tests advised by other doctors.
Even finally he requested that he was having an emergency (because we cannot endanger other patient's life when that patient requires URGENT medical attention). But you repeatedly asked to know the SPELLING OF EACH TEST advised by the doctor. The tests were clearly written in prescription and it did not require the doctor to spell the name of each test.
Therefore in future when you visit any doctor, please remember,
1) all patients may not get equal time in consultation. The time depends on the severity of the problem patient is suffering.
2) don't compete with other patients regarding time
3) don't ask the doctor to judge the prescription of another doctor. (You purposefully avoided explanation of this).
4) the spelling of the tests can be asked from the laboratory.

On my first visit to Dr Dasgupta he patiently listened to my entire history and advised me to first try to get  out of this trauma and advised few medical tests based on the redults of which he could start the treatment. Since my husband used to work out of West Bengal,  we could not start the treatment immediately and visited Dr after few months with the results of the tests once my husband shifted to Kolkata exclusively for the purpose of my treatment. 

Based on the reports of the tests advised by Dr Dasgupta, he suggested me the options of treatments suitable for me. I didnot have the willingness or courage to go through IVF once again hence I requested him for alternative treatment with the help of medicines/injections only.According to my preference Dr started ovulation induction treatment which was planned for 6 months at least. Initially  I was not responding to the OI medicines but with God's blessings and Dr Dasgupta's expertise the treatment started to work out and miraculously I conceived in the first month of treatment only. It was totally unexpected for me because conceiving naturslly after failure in Ivf was totally unimaginable!

It was then when I realised Dr Sujoy Dasgupta was God Sent for me. 

But my struggle didnot end there. In fact it became more difficult due to my age of 37 years  and other innumerable complications each day almost till last moment which increased my fear of losing my child once again through out the period !

However, with God's Blessings and  dedication, knowledge, confidence and expertise of Dr Dasgupta I have given birth to my little angel, my dearest daughter last week.

I must mention here, during this entire pregnancy period whenever  I contacted Dr Dasgupta he almost immediately responded to me through whatsapp everytime  and helped me get out of the complication arised in spite of his busy schedule .

Moreover, scientifically, a single semen analysis is not at all reliable and no treatment can be done based on a single semen analysis. Therefore, it is always advisable to do semen analysis from infertility laboratory to confirm whether it is actually good or bad. Many times we have seen the second semen analysis report is completely different. 
In any infertility clinic of the World, both husband and wife need to come together. Even if there is problem in husband's sperm only, the wife need to be seen by the infertility specialist who will discuss the treatment ONLY after seeing reports of both. In our centre, the charge Rs 1200 includes 
1. Consultation charges for both husband and wife 
2. Psychological counseling, which is mandatory for any infertility clinic as per Govt of India 
3. TVS ultrasound for wife.
You paid the charge and we offered you all these but you refused treatment and any test for your wife.
You wanted to act very smart and you thought only your report will be checked. Medicine practice has its rule and you can NOT change the way of treatment. We requested you to do evaluation of your wife which would have been done without spending anything extra. But you refused that. You repeatedly insisted on medicines. Before giving any medicine we need to see whether medicine is actually needed. But you were very much stubborn and you thought you know everything of infertility treatment. 
We are thankful that our patients rely completely on us when they come to our clinic. 
I will advise you to write a book on infertility treatment where you can dictate how treatment should be done. Good luck.",2024-04-17T17:21:20+0000,Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta

Some patients need extra time (even an hour) while in some other cases the consultation can be completed within 5 minutes.
Regarding your problem our Dr already reassured you that you did not have any big problem and advised some tests.
Then you showed tests and medicines advised by other doctors and asked for opinion on it. Nobody can judge the prescription of another doctor. We can not comment on tests advised by other doctors.
Even finally he requested that he was having an emergency (because we cannot endanger other patient's life when that patient requires URGENT medical attention). But you repeatedly asked to know the SPELLING OF EACH TEST advised by the doctor. The tests were clearly written in prescription and it did not require the doctor to spell the name of each test.
Therefore in future when you visit any doctor, please remember,
1) all patients may not get equal time in consultation. The time depends on the severity of the problem patient is suffering.
2) don't compete with other patients regarding time
3) don't ask the doctor to judge the prescription of another doctor. (You purposefully avoided explanation of this).
4) the spelling of the tests can be asked from the laboratory.

On my first visit to Dr Dasgupta he patiently listened to my entire history and advised me to first try to get  out of this trauma and advised few medical tests based on the redults of which he could start the treatment. Since my husband used to work out of West Bengal,  we could not start the treatment immediately and visited Dr after few months with the results of the tests once my husband shifted to Kolkata exclusively for the purpose of my treatment. 

Based on the reports of the tests advised by Dr Dasgupta, he suggested me the options of treatments suitable for me. I didnot have the willingness or courage to go through IVF once again hence I requested him for alternative treatment with the help of medicines/injections only.According to my preference Dr started ovulation induction treatment which was planned for 6 months at least. Initially  I was not responding to the OI medicines but with God's blessings and Dr Dasgupta's expertise the treatment started to work out and miraculously I conceived in the first month of treatment only. It was totally unexpected for me because conceiving naturslly after failure in Ivf was totally unimaginable!

It was then when I realised Dr Sujoy Dasgupta was God Sent for me. 

But my struggle didnot end there. In fact it became more difficult due to my age of 37 years  and other innumerable complications each day almost till last moment which increased my fear of losing my child once again through out the period !

However, with God's Blessings and  dedication, knowledge, confidence and expertise of Dr Dasgupta I have given birth to my little angel, my dearest daughter last week.

I must mention here, during this entire pregnancy period whenever  I contacted Dr Dasgupta he almost immediately responded to me through whatsapp everytime  and helped me get out of the complication arised in spite of his busy schedule .

Pregnancy is not a disease, but its a process that turns a woman into a mother. It has huge impact for other persons in the family too. We understand that the couples feel excited about the pregnancy and at the same time there is justifiable anxiety regarding the unborn and the process of pregnancy and delivery. we know that its only the couple who have to travel through this path but we can guide them throughout, advise them what to do and what not to do, answer their all questions, (as it's quite natural for the women to ask some questions, which sometimes may seem like ""stupid""- but these are rational for them). When a person is admitted to hospital, he or she feels nervous and lonely. We may not be there for long time but timely attendance can provide them reassurance and help them recover fast. This is more important for a pregnant woman, who need to take care of herself, as well as her baby. Thank you again for your kind words. With lots of blessings for your little prince....",2017-07-25T15:07:30+0000,Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta

None,None,0,0,YES,"It was an awesome experience with Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta, a very careful, very responsive doctor. We went to Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta in 1'st March 2019. In our first visit, he listened to us carefully and look at the previous reports. Due to some medical problems, we were not having any children. After a very methodical and careful treatment, my wife conceived after a month. Since we were from Burdwan, he suggested us not to visit him after 3 months and he referred to a doctor at Burdwan, who is also a very caring, responsive, helpful doctor. But he told us to keep him updated with all the test reports through whatsapp. I used to send him all the reports and he gave us his valuable suggestion each time. Also, I talked to him over the phone as my wife was having some problems in her 5 months of pregnancy and he listened to me carefully and gave his suggestions. On 18'th November my wife gave birth of a baby boy. As I informed him, he asked their condition until my wife and son are discharged from the nurshinghome.

Many many thanks to him for everything...",2019-12-04 05:38:05,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

We believe we should spend sufficient tine during consultation with a couple struggling to conceive, so that we can explain everything, remove all myths and misconceptions and give them support to relieve their stress. There is no ""full-proof treatment"" for Infertility. Every Treatment has its pros and cons. That's why the couple should discuss in details with the doctor before taking the decision for a particular treatment. Majority of the couples actually conceive with proper treatment. But the decision must be taken by the couple, of course after consulting the doctor. 
Secondly any pregnancy leads to lots of anxiety for the couples. This is particularly true for those who conceive after Infertility Treatment. Our duty is to guide the women , to provide them proper medical care, to remove all misconceptions, to give them support and to give proper explanation. At the same time, we emphasize that ""Pregnancy is NOT a disease"", so we advise the women to remain as ""normal"" as possible.

Now regarding diabetes in pregnancy, Indian women are predisposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can affect the health of mother and baby and may lead to long-standing diabetes in mother, even after pregnancy. As per international recommendations, we advise ALL PREGNANT WOMEN OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) using 75 gram glucose, because this is the ONLY RECOMMENDED TEST that can pick up diabetes in pregnancy (Not simple fasting or PP Sugar). If its diagnosed, mother needs proper monitoring including checking kidney, eye and regular ultrasound of baby and timely delivery.

His words came true and when I repeated ultrasonography after 3 months, my cysts disappeared. Then Dr Dasgupta started to give drugs for my infertility problems and within 6 months I conceived.

What we did, was a part of our routine duty towards our patients. We feel it's very important not only to ask details of the patient's health condition but also to take care of how the disease is affecting the Patient and what is patient's view on the disease and treatment. This is called ""Patient Centred Approach"" in modern medicine. We arr here to guide you. A doctor cannot take decisions. It's only the patient who can decide the best for his/ her treatment, after weighing all merits and demerits. Our duty is to explain all the risks and benefits to the patient. Thank you so much. Enjoy your life. ",2020-01-31T14:22:27+0000,Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta
