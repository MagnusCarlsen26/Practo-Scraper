In 2022 we went to her to plan for a baby. She made all the tests but never asked to test thyroid. When my wife became pregnant and faced some complications and we went to her then she asked us to show the thyroid report and we told her that you did not prescribe TSH test . Knowing this fact she asked me to show her 1 st prescription, when I gave that to her then she added TSH test with the list of  tests prescribed in the 1st prescription . When TSH was done my wife was found with high thyroid.
