,,0,0,Yes,"Visited the hospital as I had a health issue. *** ********* *** ***** I was not able to follow up due to lockdown. I need to take some tests and visit hospital again. I had to visit mid-march but due to the current situation, I need to visit again later once the issues resolve. Medicines were prescribed. I had issue related to Insulin and the hormonal level was high. Waiting time was there and visited twice there. I am satisfied with the treatment given.
