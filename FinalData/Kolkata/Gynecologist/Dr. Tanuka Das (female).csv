,,0,0,YES,"Thank you Ma'am for the wonderful experience we had with you at Peerless Hospital. You are incredible. 
We are sharing this story of the wonderful experience we had with Dr Tanuka Dasgupta . She is just incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my daughter's health who was her patient but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. She explained everything to my daughter in a very clear manner. Dr Tanuka Dasgupta is really godsent. She is a wonderful surgeon. She operated on my daughter with a huge ovarian cyst through laparoscopy which other doctors suggested open one. With her blessings my daughter recovered quickly. My sincere gratitude to her and feel fortunate to have chose her. We would highly recommend her to anyone.",2022-12-01 10:34:42,False,True,UTTAM DAS,,,
,,0,0,YES,"Dr, Tanuka Das Gupta is a sweetheart,we felt welcomed by her sweet smiling face as she guided me and my husband just like our elder sister in clearing all our queries before planning our pregnancy,giving us time and equal attention.  Due to her open conversation and  transperancy regarding her patient it was easy for us to discuss things in detail which usually people dont.Not  only did she did an excellent job of delivering my baby healthy and me being fine but also cured my  infection which i was suffering post marriage. God bless her for being so enthusiastic in her fieldüíüüëç",2020-10-14 19:43:01,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
