Many thoughts came into our minds and started searching of good gyno doctor near to our location. People say Doctors are living God on earth and fortunately we found her in form of Dr. Kavita Mandal. I Booked appointment and went there very next day. We were mostly in dilemma and confusion on what to do as we have 1.6-year-old baby and no other member available with us for taking care of the baby.\nOn the first visit Kavita mam checked all the previous reports, listened to our thoughts and concerns carefully, made us understand about next steps and allow us a week to make a decision wisely. We were just blown away with her deep touches to our mind and souls and within next 4 days we went again with positiveness of going ahead with the pregnancy. \nWe have come across with many doctors at different states though out India but it was one of those rare findings where we got a true guide more than just a doctor. From the day one Mam told us to get in touch with her with any kind of queries anytime on her personal WhatsApp number and we reached out many times, every time mam provided her feedback/suggestions on next steps. Apart from her own treatment, whenever it was required, mam referred to other best doctors available at near by locations. \nIn brief, we must say, Dr. Kavita Mam is exactly what we all expect out of our doctors. She is very careful, polite and always welcome patients with a smile. \nThank you, Ma\u2019am, for everything! we are grateful to you!!! Bless our son and keep doing best for the society :)\n",

I used to bombard her with my questions/doubts and she responded patiently throughout the journey. The most vital suggestion i got from her was to stop following \"University of Google\" for every small thing. From day 1, she was also available for us over WhatsApp and calls, in case of any emergency, and under her guidance, I have completed my entire pregnancy without any complication, I got the shock of my life in the 38 weeks when I come to know that she will not be available for the delivery due to unfortunate circumstances where she got injured and fractured her leg.Even during this time when she needed rest, she was available for us and suggested we visit one of her colleagues at Neotia and advised not to miss regular check-ups at any cost.  Dr. Kavita was in constant touch during these final moments, and have shared the required details with her colleague cum friend even before we met Dr. Vineeta.  Finally, Dr. Vineeta came as a savior and helped me to deliver a healthy baby girl (our bundle of joy) in 17 June 2021.I would recommend both Dr. Kavita and Dr. Vineeta to all the young couples, family, and friends.",

We had a mis-carriage last year and my wife was mentally very upset & afraid. The previous doctor was not bad though but somehow I got the feeling that he was very outdated. My wife needed special care. Thinking into all these aspects I googled out for the best Doctors in Kolkata and it suggested the name of Dr. Kavita Mandal. It also showed she was in AIIMS Delhi earlier. As I had spent 17 years of my youth in Delhi and had encountered many successful treatment cases in AIIMS including my father & aunt, I knew what it is all about.\n\nWe consulted Dr. Kavita Mandal and told her everything about our past mis-carriage and that we wanted to plan again fresh. Right from the scratch, she provided excellent guidance about the hows-whats-whens to plan. My wife was mentally very upset but on following her easy guidelines, she successfully conceived again.\n\nThereafter, it was a continuous chain of visits, approximately but not limited to once in a month visit. I could see that my wife was gaining her confidence back again this time. I told the doctor that we are surrendering ourselves completely to you and in turn she took it up and did not disappoint us.\n\nHer nature is very good. She always acted normally provided us with the ease of sharing with her anything that we thought important. Never did she try or say anything that would make us afraid or bother. She kept everything so simple, yet I could feel that things are working out.\n\nAdditionally, my friend & his wife were also seeking her treatment as she was also expecting. Her expected date was 1 month later.\nFinally, the day arrived and she said that she will hand our treasure to us which she did. We were blessed with a healthy baby girl on 14-May-2021. I was happy for my wife as I could see her behaving normally again. I got everything back whatever I had lost last year.\n\nAdditionally, my friend's wife, unfortunately, her sack started leaking the day our baby was born. They thought it was the end and were very sad. But, Dr. Kavita told us not to worry again. Behaving normally, she came to the rescue and successfully operated her and they were blessed with a baby boy just the very next day on 15-May-2021. Even though it was premature but with her guidance and proper treatment, the baby is in good shape and condition today after 2 months of delivery and is completely normal.\n\nWe both the families are indebted to her for her smart, simple and successful treatment. Today we are both happy families because of her. I am proud my decision that I selected her. \n\nIf you ask me, she is the ONE and only that I will recommend every time. Her success rate seems to be 100%. Thank you doctor for everything.",

I came to her in my 5th month of pregnancy for Normal delivery (which is very rare now a days) and I needed a trustworthy and experienced doctor. She is very good, soft spoken and very friendly, very approachable, very humble and has a great sense of humour. She was always available on whatsapp and calls in case of any emergency. My entire pregnancy was so smooth under her guidance and without any complication.We are blessed with a baby boy on 7th Aug\u201923 through Normal delivery. \n\nI wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the exceptional care and support she has provided during my entire pregnancy. Thank you so much once again for being an outstanding doctor. I am fortunate to have you as my gynaecologist. She is the only one I will recommend others.\n\nThank you Doctor for your professionalism and kindness.\nI would love to be your \u201cgenuine\u201dadvertisement partner\ud83d\ude0a\n\n",

To begin with, she had been the guardian Angel to us in true sense, during the 8.5 months of our pregnancy journey, and we are blessed with our beautiful daughter who came to see the world in her hands.\nNot always you come across a doctor with so much of empathy, and of course dedication. She did treat us like family and never did she fail to respond to any query over a simple WhatsApp chat, even if it\u2019s late in the night; and we couldn\u2019t have been more amazed given the busy schedule she does have as a doctor.\nHere I must mention, there had been small complications with my wife\u2019s health and she had timely recommended another great doctor.\nIt had been much of a surprise to us, that not only her, but her recommended doctors (even our baby\u2019s paediatrician) somehow holds upto the same standards.\nOverall, any adjective would fall short to describe her greatness, both as a doctor and as a human being. We are more than blessed to have her as our doctor and guardian.",

We stay in a different town and had came to Kolkata for check up in Bhagirathi Neotia New Town with some other doctor with whom we were under tele  consultation since my wife was 1 month pregnant . By fate of god, that particular day she had cancelled all her bookings due to some exigencies. (Here I need to thank that particular doctor with whom we were under tele consultation as she had helped us a lot in the initial month with all our issues) To continue\u2026It was then from the reception desk Dr. Kavita Mandal was suggested to us and we agreed to it. \nThat decision of us was the best decision we took that day as I have never met any doctor till date as humble, as kind, as helpful, as approachable, as proactive, as sincere and as responsible doctor then Dr. Kavita Mandal. My wife had many complications, my baby had lately developed certain complications but it was under her timely treatment we as a couple was blessed with a baby boy on 19th July 2022 (in 34 weeks of pregnancy). Our baby was in NICU for 8 days and was later discharged. It\u2019s been said that when in need God sends it\u2019s angel for the help of mankind. For us the angel is Dr. Kavita Mandal. \nNo words or adjectives can describe the true value of Dr. Kavita Mandal. She is the epitome of kindness and a true Doctor in all aspects, highly recommended if you are planning parenthood.\nThank you mam, we are indebted to you for our entire life. ",

Looking at the reviews I went to her and found out that she is very good at her job and at the same time she is very friendly and soft spoken. She is always available on WhatsApp for answering small small problems. She called me herself also couple of times whenever she felt it was important to guide me. She was very systematic throughout my pregnancy for various blood tests and sonographies. My experience of c section delivery was also very very good with her as she made it very comfortable for me. After delivery also, she took care of everything about my health and gave every possible suggestion. I am very much satisfied with her treatment and I have already suggested her name to somebody who asked me about a good gynecologist. I will also refer her name to people whoever will be in need. \n",

She is very supportive,positive and transparent about the treatment and underlying issues. She was always available on call and on watsapp everytime I needed a quick advice throughout my pregnancy journey. And yes she does remember every minute detail that you have ever discussed with her. I am blessed with baby boy under her supervision at neotia this March. Though I was not very satisfied with hospital service, I couldn't expect a better doctor than Dr. Kavita. She listens to all your issues, clarifies all your doubts and calms you downs before starting the treatment. During pregnancy every small thing will trigger your panic mode but a connect with Dr. Kavita will surely calm you down so please go for her and your pregnancy journey will be beautiful.  Thankyou ma'am for all you support and guidance, it wouldn't have been possible without u.",

We started consulting her when my wife was in the third trimester. Each time we went to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She payed attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity, Analysed all our reports from scratch since we were on-boarded late( i still remember she spent 20min in our first visit to go through the old reports). As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions and issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding. Coming to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. She visited us daily when my wife was admitted in hospital. Even in the OT she was consoling my wife, who was under the panic of C-Section. Blessed with a princess on 25th Aug. We thank you, Dr. Kavita, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything.We strongly recommend her.\nThanks & Regards,\nKrishanu & Swati.",

Many thoughts came into our minds and started searching of good gyno doctor near to our location. People say Doctors are living God on earth and fortunately we found her in form of Dr. Kavita Mandal. I Booked appointment and went there very next day. We were mostly in dilemma and confusion on what to do as we have 1.6-year-old baby and no other member available with us for taking care of the baby.\nOn the first visit Kavita mam checked all the previous reports, listened to our thoughts and concerns carefully, made us understand about next steps and allow us a week to make a decision wisely. We were just blown away with her deep touches to our mind and souls and within next 4 days we went again with positiveness of going ahead with the pregnancy. \nWe have come across with many doctors at different states though out India but it was one of those rare findings where we got a true guide more than just a doctor. From the day one Mam told us to get in touch with her with any kind of queries anytime on her personal WhatsApp number and we reached out many times, every time mam provided her feedback/suggestions on next steps. Apart from her own treatment, whenever it was required, mam referred to other best doctors available at near by locations. \nIn brief, we must say, Dr. Kavita Mam is exactly what we all expect out of our doctors. She is very careful, polite and always welcome patients with a smile. \nThank you, Ma\u2019am, for everything! we are grateful to you!!! Bless our son and keep doing best for the society :)\n",

I used to bombard her with my questions/doubts and she responded patiently throughout the journey. The most vital suggestion i got from her was to stop following \"University of Google\" for every small thing. From day 1, she was also available for us over WhatsApp and calls, in case of any emergency, and under her guidance, I have completed my entire pregnancy without any complication, I got the shock of my life in the 38 weeks when I come to know that she will not be available for the delivery due to unfortunate circumstances where she got injured and fractured her leg.Even during this time when she needed rest, she was available for us and suggested we visit one of her colleagues at Neotia and advised not to miss regular check-ups at any cost.  Dr. Kavita was in constant touch during these final moments, and have shared the required details with her colleague cum friend even before we met Dr. Vineeta.  Finally, Dr. Vineeta came as a savior and helped me to deliver a healthy baby girl (our bundle of joy) in 17 June 2021.I would recommend both Dr. Kavita and Dr. Vineeta to all the young couples, family, and friends.",

We had a mis-carriage last year and my wife was mentally very upset & afraid. The previous doctor was not bad though but somehow I got the feeling that he was very outdated. My wife needed special care. Thinking into all these aspects I googled out for the best Doctors in Kolkata and it suggested the name of Dr. Kavita Mandal. It also showed she was in AIIMS Delhi earlier. As I had spent 17 years of my youth in Delhi and had encountered many successful treatment cases in AIIMS including my father & aunt, I knew what it is all about.\n\nWe consulted Dr. Kavita Mandal and told her everything about our past mis-carriage and that we wanted to plan again fresh. Right from the scratch, she provided excellent guidance about the hows-whats-whens to plan. My wife was mentally very upset but on following her easy guidelines, she successfully conceived again.\n\nThereafter, it was a continuous chain of visits, approximately but not limited to once in a month visit. I could see that my wife was gaining her confidence back again this time. I told the doctor that we are surrendering ourselves completely to you and in turn she took it up and did not disappoint us.\n\nHer nature is very good. She always acted normally provided us with the ease of sharing with her anything that we thought important. Never did she try or say anything that would make us afraid or bother. She kept everything so simple, yet I could feel that things are working out.\n\nAdditionally, my friend & his wife were also seeking her treatment as she was also expecting. Her expected date was 1 month later.\nFinally, the day arrived and she said that she will hand our treasure to us which she did. We were blessed with a healthy baby girl on 14-May-2021. I was happy for my wife as I could see her behaving normally again. I got everything back whatever I had lost last year.\n\nAdditionally, my friend's wife, unfortunately, her sack started leaking the day our baby was born. They thought it was the end and were very sad. But, Dr. Kavita told us not to worry again. Behaving normally, she came to the rescue and successfully operated her and they were blessed with a baby boy just the very next day on 15-May-2021. Even though it was premature but with her guidance and proper treatment, the baby is in good shape and condition today after 2 months of delivery and is completely normal.\n\nWe both the families are indebted to her for her smart, simple and successful treatment. Today we are both happy families because of her. I am proud my decision that I selected her. \n\nIf you ask me, she is the ONE and only that I will recommend every time. Her success rate seems to be 100%. Thank you doctor for everything.",

We stay in a different town and had came to Kolkata for check up in Bhagirathi Neotia New Town because our family stays here. We came to know about Dr Kavita Mandal from Practo and after looking at the positive feedback and reviews from the patient we decided to go for a consultation. She is very efficient and professional. I came to her in my 5th month of pregnancy for Normal delivery (which is very rare now a days) and I needed a trustworthy and experienced doctor. She is very good, soft spoken and very friendly, very approachable, very humble and has a great sense of humour. She was always available on whatsapp and calls in case of any emergency. My entire pregnancy was so smooth under her guidance and without any complication.We are blessed with a baby boy on 7th Aug\u201923 through Normal delivery. \n\nI wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the exceptional care and support she has provided during my entire pregnancy. Thank you so much once again for being an outstanding doctor. I am fortunate to have you as my gynaecologist. She is the only one I will recommend others.\n\nThank you Doctor for your professionalism and kindness.\nI would love to be your \u201cgenuine\u201dadvertisement partner\ud83d\ude0a\n\n",

She did treat us like family and never did she fail to respond to any query over a simple WhatsApp chat, even if it\u2019s late in the night; and we couldn\u2019t have been more amazed given the busy schedule she does have as a doctor.\nHere I must mention, there had been small complications with my wife\u2019s health and she had timely recommended another great doctor.\nIt had been much of a surprise to us, that not only her, but her recommended doctors (even our baby\u2019s paediatrician) somehow holds upto the same standards.\nOverall, any adjective would fall short to describe her greatness, both as a doctor and as a human being. We are more than blessed to have her as our doctor and guardian.",

By fate of god, that particular day she had cancelled all her bookings due to some exigencies. (Here I need to thank that particular doctor with whom we were under tele consultation as she had helped us a lot in the initial month with all our issues) To continue\u2026It was then from the reception desk Dr. Kavita Mandal was suggested to us and we agreed to it. \nThat decision of us was the best decision we took that day as I have never met any doctor till date as humble, as kind, as helpful, as approachable, as proactive, as sincere and as responsible doctor then Dr. Kavita Mandal. My wife had many complications, my baby had lately developed certain complications but it was under her timely treatment we as a couple was blessed with a baby boy on 19th July 2022 (in 34 weeks of pregnancy). Our baby was in NICU for 8 days and was later discharged. It\u2019s been said that when in need God sends it\u2019s angel for the help of mankind. For us the angel is Dr. Kavita Mandal. \nNo words or adjectives can describe the true value of Dr. Kavita Mandal. She is the epitome of kindness and a true Doctor in all aspects, highly recommended if you are planning parenthood.\nThank you mam, we are indebted to you for our entire life. ",

I conceived my twins in Germany and for my delivery I had to come to Kolkata and I needed a trustworthy and experienced doctor. Looking at the reviews I went to her and found out that she is very good at her job and at the same time she is very friendly and soft spoken. She is always available on WhatsApp for answering small small problems. She called me herself also couple of times whenever she felt it was important to guide me. She was very systematic throughout my pregnancy for various blood tests and sonographies. My experience of c section delivery was also very very good with her as she made it very comfortable for me. After delivery also, she took care of everything about my health and gave every possible suggestion. I am very much satisfied with her treatment and I have already suggested her name to somebody who asked me about a good gynecologist. I will also refer her name to people whoever will be in need. \n",

She was always available on call and on watsapp everytime I needed a quick advice throughout my pregnancy journey. And yes she does remember every minute detail that you have ever discussed with her. I am blessed with baby boy under her supervision at neotia this March. Though I was not very satisfied with hospital service, I couldn't expect a better doctor than Dr. Kavita. She listens to all your issues, clarifies all your doubts and calms you downs before starting the treatment. During pregnancy every small thing will trigger your panic mode but a connect with Dr. Kavita will surely calm you down so please go for her and your pregnancy journey will be beautiful.  Thankyou ma'am for all you support and guidance, it wouldn't have been possible without u.",

She payed attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity, Analysed all our reports from scratch since we were on-boarded late( i still remember she spent 20min in our first visit to go through the old reports). As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions and issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding. Coming to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. She visited us daily when my wife was admitted in hospital. Even in the OT she was consoling my wife, who was under the panic of C-Section. Blessed with a princess on 25th Aug. We thank you, Dr. Kavita, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything.We strongly recommend her.\nThanks & Regards,\nKrishanu & Swati.",

I feel great to share that I contacted her through Practo itself, it is a genuine site and oh wow I got one of the best doctors I have ever met. My whole experience with Dr.Kavita was very good starting from family planning, delivery and contraception to post delivery care. She is very friendly at the same time very professional, she never gives unnecessary tests or medicines . \nShe is very ************* **** supporting and caring and always reachable whenever we were in need or doubt. She always spent quality time to clarify all the doubts we had  and discussed all the reports in detail with us.  She is very friendly and very responsive be it over the call or WhatsApp. Surely its been great visiting her everytime and the whole journey with the doctor was a very enjoyable. Our darling daughter was delivered very healthy and everything else was fine. \nWe discussed about which hospital I should get admitted to, the infrastructure and facilities of that hospital, thus she took care of the financial side as well. She treated me like an elder sister would do to her younger sister. I would undoubtedly strongly recommend her to everyone in need.",

We consulted few Doctors for 2nd opinion when we we\u2019re looking for options and found Dr Kavita to be best. She managed situation so well. She not only gave right treatment but made us feel comfortable and helped us manage our concerns and anxiety. She counsels really well and keeps patient confident. My wife was very satisfied with her treatment and guidance. She respond to patient genuine queries instantly over whatsapp/ messages. My wife delivered Healthy baby and she has also recovered quite well and fast. Can\u2019t thank Doctor enough. We consulted Dr through google reviews and now with experience can vouch for all the positive reviews.",

She can be reached through whatsApp at any time for any doubts. My wife delivered a healthy baby under her guidance. Our OT experience was also good. she explained everything in details pre and post delivery. My wife is fully fit within 15-20 days after delivery.

We had visited Dr. Kavita Mandal when we thought to become parents. Since then throughout pregnancy she always guided us whenever we were in problems. She is very much friendly and caring towards her patients. Me and my wife I think are very lucky to got treated from this Dr. Kavita Mandal. As in this corona time she guided us very well. My wife was not ready for csection as she was afraid of the side effects but in the influence of Dr. she got ready and under her guidance and by God grace my wife delivered our little bundle of joy on 29th of April.. Our baby boy. I am very much thankful to you ma'am for always being with us in this tough time... \nI always recommend Dr. Kavita Mandal whenever anybody seeks for best gyne..",

Her soothing words n friendly nature eased my confused mind a lot. She was always there 24\u00d77 over call or whatsapp whenever I needed her. She is so efficient at hand that I could hardly mark out my incision mark. Even after my delivery she always helped me over call with her suggestion whenever I needed her. To me I never felt her as doc she always gave me the feeling of family. I am blessed with a baby boy and would give all the credit to Dr Kavita Mam to fill my life with this heavenly happiness. Thank u Mam for making my pregnancy journey so easeful. I would highly recommend Mam not only my friends n relatives but to all the persons going thru my feedback.",

But under her able medical supervision, all has went well and we have been blessed with our baby boy, for which we shall always be grateful to Dr. Kavita. May you touch many more lives with your care and capabilities ma'am. Best regards always.",

Doctor assured us that everything will be fine and prescribed medicines and suggested weight loss. I conceived under her guidance in August 2021. My pregnancy journey went very smooth under her proper treatment upto 31 weeks. In one of my normal checkups in 31st week, my amniotic fluid level came on the lower side though the usg report said adequate fluid. Doctor told us to repeat USG every week since if the fluid level drops more, we have to do pre term delivery. We were horribly tensed but doctor kept assuring us that the baby will be fine but we may have to keep the baby in NICU for 3-4 weeks. Next week in repeat USG, my fluid level dropped further and she took an immediate decision to do c- section next day on 32.4 weeks. She sensed that we are extremely worried and constantly counselled and assured us. She did an amazing C-section which healed in a week and left almost zero scar. In the OT also she was constantly calming me. I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl, thankfully she didn't require NICU and was released in just 8 days from special care from Bhagirathi Neotia. We are grateful to Dr Kavita Mandal for her timely intervention and decision due to which both me and my daughter are doing well. Dr. Kavita mandal is very friendly and never panics her patients. I highly recommend her. ",

But the way she has taken care my wife was remarkable.\n\nLike other doctor she is not in hurry, so whatever the queries, you are having you can ask her. She won't make you unhappy with her attitude because she is very cool. \n\nTill pregnancy to hospital I didn't find myself worried that what to do or what's gonna happen because the way Kavita Mandal guided us was really good.\n\nFrankly speaking I am very happy that everything happened without any hassle, which I never expected. I thought I need to go here there and take lots of tension but there was nothing like that. I am really very happy that I get in touch with Kavita Mandal and got my first baby under her supervision. \n\nIf you wanna make yourself hassle free and pay attention on your work during your wife pregnancy then get in touch with Kavita Mandal. *** ** *** **** ************* *** provide the best solution.\n\nThank you very much mam \ud83d\ude4f\n",

I went for a gyne then and there and as I've heard positive feedback from people about kavita mondal, I chose her. She was behaving well and good until the time I mentioned I'm in a relationship and I had got intimate, which was 3 months back. Her behavior suddenly changed and she started talking so rudely. she didn't even listened to me what I was saying. She got stuck on that point that the infection is because of your sexual activity. *** ****** ****** ** ******* *** ***** ******** the consultation fee was 600 but she was not ready to listen to 6 lines from me. That day I was quite upset for her behavior.1) When you are seeing a patient, Can you please listen to her problem!2) Sex is not the answer to all the infection. I have to use office toilet which is used by 100 of girls a day. That could have been the reason. I wear skinny jeans,that could have been the reason. My diet and workout plan could have been the reason.3) Being in a relationship, having premarital sex is completely my choice. I know India is not that advanced to accept such things.

Not only has she taken great care of my wifes through out the pregnancy period but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.\nWe are blessed with a baby boy on 5th Sep'22 at ILS on her observation.\nIt\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person. I highly recommend becoming her patient.\n\nThank you Mam for your lovely behavior and support throughout the Journey.\n\nThanks and Regards\nSubhamita Porel\nProsenjit Porel",
