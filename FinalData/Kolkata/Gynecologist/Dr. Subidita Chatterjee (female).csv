"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"After reading various reviews on Practo I decided to consult Doctor Mam for my mother who has been suffering from unbearable pain in her vaginal and lower abdomen area.

Doctor mam thoroughly and patiently listened to all the issues that my mother had to share. She gave adequate time to diagnose my mother.

She explained each and everything in a very detailed manner to me and my mother.But unfortunately, the root cause of the suffering that my mother is experiencing has not yet been detected.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Gynae Problems,",0,0,YES,"I consulted Ma'am for some health issues. Before visiting her chamber, I was very nervous and anxious about my health issues. However, after consulting her, I was relieved and happy.
There are so many things, which I appreciate about her and her clinic. First, I've visited some big hospitals also in the recent past, but I must say, at her clinic, the safety protocols against Covid were much better than some very reputed hospitals. From sanitization to masks, they followed all protocols. I felt safe the moment I stepped in.
Second, her clinic has all equipment and so unlike hospitals, you don't need to rush from one counter to other for reports. She instantly diagnoses your problem.
Third, she never pushes you with extra medicines, tests or procedures. She does what is deemed best. 
Last, she gives ample time, doesn't judge or discriminate.
I've recently started her treatment and hope the meds will do its work.
So please don't suffer in silence and visit her if you have some issues.

She assured me that it is impossible to contract any infection because the instrument there is properly sterilized after each examination. And she had used all sorts of protection, taken my consent before going through with the examination. She assured me that everything is fine. What I found so thoughtful was she even asked me that if I am having any infection or not,  which I am NOT ,nothing. It was just my anxiety. I am so pleased that she paid heed to my paranoia which any other doctor would have found bothering and I was assured that the procedure was completely safe and there is no risk of such cross contamination.

When you came to me the first time,probably the pregnancy was less than 4 weeks so it is often not visible on USG. But then we ask the patients to do a beta HCG blood test which can detect pregnancy even at 2 or 3 weeks.
So it is unlikely that I did not ask you to do the blood test or even ask you to come after 2 weeks to confirm.
I would have said that if it is confirmed only them your take the medicine.
