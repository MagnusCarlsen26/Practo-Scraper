"Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I visited OMNI hospital kukatpally, with my uncle as he had a pain in the heart region. 

The Doctor was not in time. Instead of him other doctor Mr. XYZ took his place (may be his fellow doctor, we felt he is the actual doctor). After our consultation with Mr.XYZ, the actual doctor came at 11:00am and read the lab reports suggested the medication.

The Doctor explained everything well, but, if he could manage himself in time will be appreciated.
