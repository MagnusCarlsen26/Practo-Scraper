It was a great experience and very glad that me and my mom met Dr. Lalith Agrawal at the right time. This Doctor proves to be the best cardiologist in around Manikonda area. He is detailed and accurate when it comes to his understanding of his patient’s health concerns. 

I was bit scared to meet Doctors as you all know unlike the scary industry out there wherein doctors dupe you for unnecessary tests and terrify you. 
But Dr. Lalith, A dynamic professional, whom you can blindly trust when it comes to getting the best expertise to handle your beloved one's health & life.

He treats you like a family member, listens to all your complaints & quarries very patiently and explains you about your condition very politely & proficiently, so that you don’t get scared but make you realize of your condition and next course of action. I really admire the way he deals with his patients, I really saved my life, thank you Dr. Lalith Agrawal.
