None,"BP Monitoring,",0,0,YES,"*** ***** ****** *********** ** *** **** ************ ** **********My family and relatives is taking treatment from him since long time,he is easily approachable,He takes time with the patient to help them with their health issues and explaing the condition in very clear manner.

In my opinion, Itâ€™s rare to find such a cardiologist like Dr. Shiva Prasad Koyalakonda that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a cardiologist specialist.
