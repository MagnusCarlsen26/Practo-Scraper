"Doctor friendliness,","Heart Conditions,",0,0,YES,We visited aware global hospital lb nagar.  The dr appointment time is nearly one hr. Dr is good n friendly. But the staff n lab incharge are very anxious n rude behaviour. They make us to wait for 3-4 hrs for only one Treadmill test which takes 10 mins time. They neither refunded my amount nor make the test.We suffered a lot with small kid of 3 years. Better to avoid diagnostic tests in aware global hospital. ,2022-12-30 09:40:54,False,True,Prakash,,,

"Wait time,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Cardiac checkup - General,",0,0,NO,"As per previous reviews, we decided to visit Dr Rajiv Garg at Aware Gleneagles LB Nagar. Unfortunately we had worse experience ever. We submitted our file at 11:30am and we're asked to wait for an hour or so as there were 7 patients lined up before us..that's absolutely fine. But while waiting outside his room (quite surprisingly he keeps the door open to all keeping no privacy to a patient's diagnosis), we could see from outside that keeping the patient waiting even in front of him he was busy with multiple calls n WhatsApp chats and not to forget catering to MRs and clicking pictures with them. **** *** ***** ******* *** **** **** ** ****** * **** * ****** ***** *** ***** **************!
