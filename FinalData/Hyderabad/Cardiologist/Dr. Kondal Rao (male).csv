"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Cardiac checkup - General,",0,0,YES,"1) There are not many feedback's posted by others about this doctor, i made my decision to visit this doctor only by seeing his experience and the some of his detailed videos on social media, which help me made my decision
2) Doctor was super simple, down to earth and mostly importantly LISTENING to our history and problems with utmost patience.
3) Doctor was clear with his decisions and gave us the reasons for those decisions. Most importantly, his prescription was super clear with course of medicine.
4) The Treat Mill Technician took 2 hours to show up at the hospital, which is the only thing we didn't liked.
