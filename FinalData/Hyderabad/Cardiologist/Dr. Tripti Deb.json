She gave me her number to call in case of any queries and I did call her as i had some questions but she was rude over the call. \nOverall, I am really thankful to her as she caught my problem within a minute and helped me lower my cholesterol.

She gave me her number to call in case of any queries and I did call her as i had some questions but she was rude over the call. \nOverall, I am really thankful to her as she caught my problem within a minute and helped me lower my cholesterol. I would definitely recommend her to other patients.",
