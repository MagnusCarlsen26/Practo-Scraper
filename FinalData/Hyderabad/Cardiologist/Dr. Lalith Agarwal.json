Both came normal but even then chest pain was persisting.  Dr advised CT coronary Angiography and it showed cardiac blocks in the arteries. Then he advised angiography which showed multiple blocks.  Stenting was done after which the chest pain got received. Father is doing well now and able to walk for five kilometres now which is his original capacity.  The patient oriented approach of doctor is note worthy and never tries to push for any procedure or any admission.  Very good approach for taking care of my father.  Difficult to find such doctors now a days.",

All went pretty well and post angiogram visit also was also very nice . Overall highly recommended to consult him based on my personal experience . he is very connected to his patients. Always there to help . Thanks a lot to the Doctor from core of my heart. \n\n",

He suggested to have the angiogram done and with all reports conclusively recommended for medical supervision. I was bit skeptical with the word angiogram, but the way he explained to me and level of comfort as more than Doctor as a friend I had with him was very satisfactory . All went pretty well and post angiogram visit also was also very nice . Overall highly recommended to consult him based on my personal experience . he is very connected to his patients. Always there to help . Thanks a lot to the Doctor from core of my heart. \n\n",

I was so worried and he just made me calm. Well my treatment is still going on so will keep adding to it. But so far I loved meeting Dr Lalith.\nHe is so well in his skills and life saving person.
