We had consulted many doctors for almost 5-6 years before visiting Dr Ratna, but we haven't got any positive results from any of those doctors. Dr Ratna gave us special care and attention, was available on WhatsApp for any of our queries. Also she doesn't prescribe too much of hormonal medicines unnecessarily. We got a positive jus after ,3-4 visits only. I would really recommend this doctor for any one who is planning for pregnancy. Once you start consulting her, You can just relax as she will take care of things for you and ensure you get what you need.",2019-04-09 10:05:28,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

These are the three incidents in a month we faced. *** ****** *** ******** ** ** ** **** ********** 
She is very good and very friendly, no doubt about that. But we are not visiting her for friendly nature. 
The following are the incidents we faced.

1. She said 'need to increase dosage' after examining the reports. When we went to pharmacy to our surprise there is no increase of dosage. We went and asked her and she said she FORGOT. Then she corrected the prescription to increased dosage.

2. In the next consultation, she didn't mention the composition of the tablet. My wife asked her that the tablets are different than the previously prescribed ones and she said SORRY I FORGOT and she corrected the prescription.

3. In the next consultation, she forgot to tell to stop a certain medication which she asked us to stop in the previous consultation. My wife again went asked the same and she said I'm SORRY I FORGOT PLEASE STOP THIS MEDICATION.",2019-03-02 16:20:02,False,False,Sai Rajputh,,,

"Wait time,","Fertility Treatment,",0,0,NO,Had booked an appointment for 26th Jan at 1:30pm. We got the confirmation message from the hospital as well. On 25th night we even got a reminder message from the hospital. We were ready and about to leave in the morning when we called the hospital to confirm once more when we were informed that the doctor will be available after 3pm and our appointment got rescheduled to 4pm. I was dissatisfied with the sense of punctuality of the doctor and the professionalism of the hospital. They did not even bother to inform me. The patients have to wait always. Is this a general understanding in this hospital? Highly dissatisfied on the first interaction. Will provide feedback in case I ever this hospital or the doctor again.,2019-01-26 08:32:12,False,False,Verified Patient,"Dear sir/ma'am
