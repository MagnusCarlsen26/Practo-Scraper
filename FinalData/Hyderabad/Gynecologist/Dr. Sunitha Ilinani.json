After going to 3 different doctors in my city and taking their opinions, I found Dr. Sunitha. My situation honestly was too far gone. Her opinion was not different from that of the other doctors that I saw. And I was not even hoping for a miracle, too. Medically, she gave me the same opinion and suggested a treatment with complete honesty and transparency. Told me about each and every experimental treatment out there as well. Explained the risk of those experimental procedures(other doctors didn't discuss the risk) but never pushed or forced me to go for it. She is super polite and kind towards her patients. Answered the silliest queries, too. I was stunned to find a doctor who is so famous and capable and has a high success rate, giving ample time to patients. During infertility treatment, a person goes through so much mentally, but she has the right amount of friendliness and professionalism. * ** ** ***** ******* **** ** ******* ** ********** *** **** ****** **** ****** ** ** ** ***** ** ** *** ************ *********** *** *** ***** *** ***** I still have the option to go for another procedure, and if I ever decide on that, I am definitely going back to her. She is the MOST TALENTED AND ETHICAL doctor in Hyderabad and has the right amount of COMPASSION for her patients. The staff is very helpful and courteous too. During the course of my treatment, I saw so many other patients coming back and thanking the staff and doctor after their successful treatments.  All the facilities required for treatment are under one roof. ",

Then i had to go and get the scan done only to hear that the scan image wasn't clear. How can they even make me pay when the scan wasn't successful?? Aren't they supposed not to charge and only charges for scan when next visit is made?

After going to 3 different doctors in my city and taking their opinions, I found Dr. Sunitha. My situation honestly was too far gone. Her opinion was not different from that of the other doctors that I saw. And I was not even hoping for a miracle, too. Medically, she gave me the same opinion and suggested a treatment with complete honesty and transparency. Told me about each and every experimental treatment out there as well. Explained the risk of those experimental procedures(other doctors didn't discuss the risk) but never pushed or forced me to go for it. She is super polite and kind towards her patients. Answered the silliest queries, too. I was stunned to find a doctor who is so famous and capable and has a high success rate, giving ample time to patients. During infertility treatment, a person goes through so much mentally, but she has the right amount of friendliness and professionalism. * ** ** ***** ******* **** ** ******* ** ********** *** **** ****** **** ****** ** ** ** ***** ** ** *** ************ *********** *** *** ***** *** ***** I still have the option to go for another procedure, and if I ever decide on that, I am definitely going back to her. She is the MOST TALENTED AND ETHICAL doctor in Hyderabad and has the right amount of COMPASSION for her patients. The staff is very helpful and courteous too. During the course of my treatment, I saw so many other patients coming back and thanking the staff and doctor after their successful treatments.  All the facilities required for treatment are under one roof. ",

Doc was supposed to review the scan in the follow up visit which is free if it's within 10 days. However, the clinic called up saying the person who does scan isn't available and rescheduled it to someother day which is after 10 days my first appointment. Then i had to go and get the scan done only to hear that the scan image wasn't clear. How can they even make me pay when the scan wasn't successful?? Aren't they supposed not to charge and only charges for scan when next visit is made? Wierd thing is i even had to pay the consultation fee again only to hear that scan wasn't successful and will be done again and I was asked to visit again. *** *** *** **** *********** **** *** **** ******* ****** ****** **** ** ********** ****** *** ** ****** ** ***** *** ****** ***** ***** **** ** ********* *** ****** ******** *** **** *** ***** ******* ",

And with in 2 months, my spouse conceived.\n\nWe are very happy with the approach of the treatment.  Testing labs and Drs cabin are closer which is also a very good factor in faster time of consultation completion. We don't have to rush to 2-5 floors every time\n ",

Every time we ask for sunitha mams appointment, appointment is given on her name but we ended up meeting different doctor (most of the times) with whom we are not comfortable and confident at!  I don't know if this is miscommunicaion  between staff and doctor or everything is going as per her instructions.
