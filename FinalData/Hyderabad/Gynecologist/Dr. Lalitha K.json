And she was dumped with heavy antibiotics. Though it as subsided, it continued after some gamp. When we visited, Dr.Lalitha mam, it was detected that in fact it is not Urinary tract infection it is slippery of uterus. Thank you Mam for rightly diagnosing. We thought that surgery may be needed. She assured that no surgery is needed. Only with the help of medication, she had cured and now my wife is healthy and got rid of the problem. Big thanks to Dr. Lalitha mam. In fact, not only my wife, the entire family is grateful to you mam.\n\nD.S. Gururaj, IRS, Asst.Commissioner of Income Tax, Karimnagar.",

My Mother because of her weakness she tried to hold the Dr Hand and Dr Lalitha garu replied saying \"dont you know you should not touch me.\" She was rude not only with my parents but with the staff as well. We went there with lot of hope but she is not a mood to listen to the patient completely. I am not sure with what mood she started her day but this is absolutely NOT acceptable. If this happened to a wife of deputy director, i am wondering what could be the experience of a lay man.  ",

She assured that no surgery is needed. Only with the help of medication, she had cured and now my wife is healthy and got rid of the problem. Big thanks to Dr. Lalitha mam.

My Mother because of her weakness she tried to hold the Dr Hand and Dr Lalitha garu replied saying \"dont you know you should not touch me.\" She was rude not only with my parents but with the staff as well. We went there with lot of hope but she is not a mood to listen to the patient completely. I am not sure with what mood she started her day but this is absolutely NOT acceptable. If this happened to a wife of deputy director, i am wondering what could be the experience of a lay man.  ",

She was asking questions to the patient very rudely and seemed to take offense on being questioned about the cause of the pain or if the patient elaborated on her symptoms. The staff at the hospital is also rude. She also shouts at her staff in front of the patients and seems to treat patients with that pent up anger.",
