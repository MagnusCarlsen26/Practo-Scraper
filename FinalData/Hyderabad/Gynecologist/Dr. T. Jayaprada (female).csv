None,None,0,0,NO,"My experience was not good with this Doctor. Did not let me explain my problems completely  and started doing all the tests. 
She is a senior doctor i agree but she should have patience to listen the patient problems first,  need to know what some one is  actually facing .
Billed 5500/-RS for first visit  including all the test and medicine.... I felt like It was a business going on there.
  i could not effort this costly treatment and continue to next  month  anymore  so visited another Doctor .
DR.Jayaprada(11 years experience)
Obestetrician and Gynaecologist
DR.Jaya is very friendly and listened to  all my problems and gave me counsiling.
DR.Bhavani gave medicines worth of 2400/-Rs.....where as Dr.Jaya gave me medicines worth of 1000/-RS
DR.BHavani charged 2600 for test(Scan, Thiroid, blood.etc)... DR. Jaya is  charging 1200 for the same tests.
 Consultation fee Dr.Bhavani  500/-RS.... Dr.Jaya 250/-( not worried about it as she is more experienced)
Almost i spent  2850/-RS  more. This amount really matters for me.

I don't suggest anyone not  to go to this doctor... if you can effort you can go. I just  Explained the things that i  experienced. Now  Choice is yours.
