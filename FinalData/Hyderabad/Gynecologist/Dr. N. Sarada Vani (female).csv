"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy with PCOD,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pre and Post Delivery Care,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,YES,"Before deciding to start a family, I sought advice from three doctors, none of whom left me satisfied. At that point, I was in good health with no thyroid or diabetes issues but was diagnosed with PCOD. Despite my initial well-being, the treatment from these doctors commenced with hormonal pills and injections, which was daunting, especially considering I endured this for one and a half years. During this time, other health issues arose, including thyroid problems and anemia, and I was on the verge of becoming pre-diabetic. My body's condition left me feeling despondent about the possibility of planning a pregnancy.

My turning point came when a colleague, who had a complicated pregnancy yet delivered a healthy baby through natural delivery, introduced me to Sarda Vani mam. Sarada mam understood my fear of hormone injections and past treatment experiences. She assured me that achieving a natural pregnancy within three months was possible through a change in lifestyle. The only requirements were a healthy diet and regular exercise. She also prioritized improving my general health, addressing my anemia and thyroid issues. My hemoglobin levels are now normal, and my thyroid is under control. I was able to conceive naturally and delivered a healthy baby boy , and we consider this a miraculous outcome. Sarda Vani mam is more than a doctor to us; she is like an angel. We credit her for our last hope and attempt at this pregnancy. I wholeheartedly recommend Sarda Vani mam, as she is not only highly experienced but also genuinely cares about your overall well-being above all else.

"Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"I consulted Ankura hospital, Banjara hills for a tubectomy surgery. I was asked to get the surgical profile tests done.  I got all the tests done (double the price ) at Ankura hospital only so that it would be easier to send the reports to doctor as they are all one team. In my reports, my Thyroid component Total T3 was abnormally high. I specifically asked the gynecologist whether we can go for surgery with high T3, for which she said yes. So the next day she had put me on complete liquid diet and that next day i was asked to get admitted by 7 am for surgery. My basic tests were done on the day of admission and they had given antibiotics and iv and prepared me for surgery. Then comes the anesthesiologist who doesn’t  give a go ahead for surgery as my Total T3 was high. Then a team of doctors discussed and they wanted to do a free T3 test and fasting glucose test to check for any abnormalities.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Caesarean Section (C Section),Complicated Pregnancy Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Visited for Pregnancy Check up 
Initially in the month of March my wife got conceived by God's grace and after 5 year's of long wait for getting pregnancy. Before to that she had 2 missed abortions along due to High sugar Levels of 450+and High BP.
Due to Covid 19 pandemic situation, there were no hospitals opened  and no doctor was available and in the situation.Actually we are trying very hard in search of treatment and the best doctor.
Even we tried contacting multiple hospital's, but no one responded us due to Covid 19.
At that stage we were blank and in confusion and  praying to God to help us to save our gifted baby.
Fortunately while searching for the best Gyanecology in the twin City , we found Dr Saradavani profile in Practo.Post reading all her past patients review's,we decided to go and consult Dr Saradavani with Practo appointment.
We explained the complete medical history of my wife regarding her past two missed abortions also.
Post doing the first Scan for wife, Dr Saradavani promised my spouse u will go home with a healthy baby this time. Don't get worried. Leave everything on me, just follow my medical instructions very strictly.
We started our treatment as per her guidance and the very best advantage at Genesis clinic is that we have diagnostic center and scan center available in the same clinic and no need to go outside for anything including pharmacy.
Another added advantage is Dr Saradavani only will do the scanning regularly to her patients.
The most added advantage for all her patients is she treats everyone like a good family friend.
Dr Saradavani listens to each and every single word very keenly and she won't compromise in any thing while she is treating the patient.
We will not get feeling that we are in the hospital for treatment. She care's everyone equally and responds when we call and text her anytime in the midnight also,if it is genuine and emergency.
I have never seen such a best, caring and responsible doctor in my life.
Dr Saradavani not only treat's the patient's, but she also gives the best advice and suggest the patient's who are middle class and lower middle class financially.
In simple words I can say she is service oriented doctor. She never accepts the credit to her if the treatment is success... She always tells us to trust and believe in God and I am just doing my duty.
So say big thanks to God not to me.
Even it's a million dollar question to me till now how she balances multiple tasks perfectly with out any miss. In fact in the morning she will be going to Kim's cuddles and evening directly she will be treating the patient's at her clinic with out rest and responds to all the patient's when ever they call and text her for anything in emergency 24x7.
She herself calls the patient's and will cross check their current medical situation and condition.
Dr Saradavani is very straight forward in her treatment and she never compromises in terms of treatment.
Finally by God's grace we are blessed with baby boy on 22nd October 2020.
Due to my wife's medical complications, she has done a Caesarean section and our baby is a premature one (34 weeks) but without  any complications with the weight of 2.6 kg.
Finally a Big Thank you to Dr Saradavani from all our family.
We can't forget her till our last breath.

My wife had a miscarriage in her first pregnancy and we visited Dr. Sarada Vani before planning our next. From that point on until the delivery of our child, she took care of my wife. 
She understood our situation well and suggested the right steps to plan for our next pregnancy.
As we had a very tragic experience the first time, we were very worried however once we got a confirmation about our pregnancy we reached out to her and she gave us hope and assurance that she will be with us. 
Right from the day it is confirmed till delivery she was constantly with us and gave a lot of hope and strength there were few days when we were worried about the baby's movements and we used to go and visit her and she would check and ensure everything is good and also she told us we can visit whenever we have a doubt or worried about the baby. 

During 2nd trimester she performed an amniotic fluid examination and ensured we were having a healthy baby and made us as well comfortable and hopeful. She was very cautious throughout this procedure. 

Before the delivery, there was a day when my wife had severe stomach and it was midnight 1 clock we called her, and she guided us. This happened again in the same month even then we called her at midnight and she acted quickly and got my wife admitted for observation.

The next day, she checked and confirmed the amniotic fluid was less so we had to go for a c-section. This was very scary but she educated both of us and our baby girl arrived. That was the happiest day of our lives, there are no words to express it. 

I highly recommend the doctor who makes every problem simpler and puts back smiles on their faces. I wish her all the good luck and happiness. She is just wonderful and god-sent.

My wife visited her during the pre-conception phase for assistance and basic tests. There were multiple issues detected in the pre-pregnancy phase (Liver issues, hypothyroidism). All of this was brought under control before pregnancy planning. In the First trimester, she had small blood clots(retro placental clot) and was on restrained travel for a few days. All went well, when in 2nd trimester she had very low haemoglobin levels. To ensure the baby's growth was not impacted she went through 2 blood transfusions guided by Ma'am. She had dengue in the 3rd trimester and when the platelet count reached 40K, she was quickly monitored to avoid any impact on the baby. And to end it all, her water broke during the 36th week and she was taken into emergency for a quick delivery. This certainly would not have been possible without Saradavani Maam and her ever helpful Genesis support staff - Murali, Chandu and Bhavani.
