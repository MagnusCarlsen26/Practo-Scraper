"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOS,",0,0,YES,"She is mother like. I felt like I am talking to some who really understand. I have pcos condition and was trying to conceive. However I was not getting my periods at all. She recommend me medicines. I am on them now. Will get it checked in 6 months again. I basically went for second opinion because my first gynac suggested surgery and I was surprised I am just 29 years of age. However , after my meeting Dr Laxmi, I was convinced to follow her medication. ",2019-08-13 16:06:06,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
