Dr Samatha also said the same thing.
A week later my wife experienced pains and spotting so we tried reaching out to the doctor but she wasn't available during an emergency. So we had to switch hospitals to Rainbow in Hyderabad ***** *** ********** ****** **** *** **** *** * ****** ********* *** ******** ** **** ** **** ****** **** **** ** *********** ***** ** ******* ****** ** ******** ** ********** We lost our baby later the next day. Now the doctor who took the scan said the babies heart beat was weak last time which we weren't informed before. DO NOT CONSULT THIS DOCTOR. We spent around 20 thousand in week for tests alone and my baby wasn't taken care of or my wife. We decided to never visit the hospital again.",2020-06-18 07:20:14,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
