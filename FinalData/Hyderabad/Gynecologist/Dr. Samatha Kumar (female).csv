None,None,0,0,YES,"I am very happy to write this review about Dr. Samatha and Birth Place hospital even when l am busy in taking care of my little princess. I hope this would help someone to find a good doctor and a good hospital....

It has been more than 11 months that the doctor and her wonderful team at Birth Place Hospital brilliantly delivered my baby (it was NVD) ...and now Iam surprised to witness the fact that Dr Samatha still recognizes me. 

We went for our baby's routine checkup with a pediatrician at Birth Place Hospital, Gatchibowli .. and Dr Samatha didnot hesitate to come and have a talk with me and my husband to know about my daughter's well abouts when she saw us waiting there.

This shows how much the doctor is dedicated and committed towards her profession and patients. *********** *** ******* ** *** **** ****** ** ** ********** if you are some like me going through the process for the first time and have many questions that are bothering for a hassle free delivery. 

And also Birth Place Hospital, it is one of the best hospitals in the city which is well maintained and clean. I am very happy that I could find this hospital in Hyderabad. Really appreciate the management for maintaining the hospital so well and also for hiering doctors like Samatha which makes us feel like being at home.. each and every penny spent is worth spending.
