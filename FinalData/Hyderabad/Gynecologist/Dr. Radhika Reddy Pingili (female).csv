"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"I was married in 2018. Soon after my marriage, I was diagnosed with tuberculosis, It was a 7 months treatment. Amidst the treatment, I conceived. I didn‚Äôt knew how to react. It was a mixed feeling as somewhere in my heart I knew that I cannot carry the baby for long. I was 5 weeks 6 days pregnant And, we were advised by the doctor to abort the baby, we took opinion of pulmonologist too but he advised us the same. So with a heavy heart we had to go for MTP. Post MTP, I suffered from various health issues (thyroid, anemia‚Ä¶) I worked on my health. Got all the tests done again and then tried to conceive. We tried for 2-3 years, but didn‚Äôt get any positive result. 
Then we decided to consult a infertility specialist and hence we reached out to Dr. Radhika. After our first meeting with the doctor, we had immense trust in her as she was approachable, honest and forthright. She explained us everything well in the initial appointments that later we didn‚Äôt had any questions to ask but just the faith in her expertise. She advised her to go for IVF ICSI and counselled us briefly about the same. It was a costly affair but all worth it. We started our IVF journey in the month of February, 2023  and now (May,2023), we are over the moon to announce our first pregnancy. Trust in doctor leads to wonders.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Fertilisation In Vitro - Embryo Transfer (IVF - ET),",0,0,YES,"Firstly, my humble request to all the couples who aspire to be parents. IVF is not an easy journey. But you have waited so long for this happiness, have a little more patience. Not everyone gets success in 1st attempt. It varies for every couple. So be patient and stay positive. That‚Äôs what worked for me.
We have been trying to conceive for 8 years. I have been struggling with PCOD due to which I had unbalanced hormone issues. I did stimulated ovulation cycles, ovarian drilling but no result. Then shifted to Hyderabad and looked for an IVF specialist nearby online. That‚Äôs how I met my doc Dr. Radhika Reddy Pingli. She was very polite, positive, calm and reassuring that we will go down this path together to help me conceive. We straightaway asked for IVF as we had waited for a long time.
We conceived the first time (1st FET) itself, but unfortunately I had early miscarriage naturally. My beta HCG levels dropped. That‚Äôs when it hit me badly as if I can never be a mother. But I kept my patience and I had to face the failure for next 2 FETs as well. 3 failed FETs and I was heartbroken but I did not lose my hope and my trust on Dr. Radhika. As she said, she really walked down this path with us. She understood my emotional situation, always offered positive advice and was always available on phone outside the hospital hours. She adapted to changes in my treatment to provide the best for me. She is very friendly and a good listener. We are blessed and I am 7 months pregnant right now. Though my conceiving journey was also a bit tensed but she helped me get through the first 5 months smoothly and I could see the happiness on her face too, which showed her concern for me. She helped us to choose a gynaecologist to continue with.
Thanks to Dr. Radhika, it‚Äôs my dream come true to be a mother. Though it took us more than a year due to this pandemic situation and 3 FET failures but all's well that ends well. We highly recommend her to anyone aspiring to be parents but facing difficulties. We will definitely meet her with our baby once the situations are normal cause she is the one who gave us this happiness and I can never thank her enough.",2021-06-22 07:01:57,False,True,Neha,"Thanks for taking time

Me and my wife are married for 7 years now and we started trying for having baby after one year of our marriage. We visited almost all the big named hospitals in Gachibowli/Chandanagar/Lingampally/Kondapur/Madhapur areas of Hyderabad giving the doctors all the time and money they wanted and ended up with no positive results. We were almost at the edge of losing hope to have baby. A doctor in one of the hospital during a routine checkup then referred us to Dr. Radhika.

We went to see her and were highly impressed by the friendly nature, vast knowledge and experience she's got and decided to go with the treatment plan she suggested.  Looking at the various procedures done by other doctors, Dr. Radhika gave us the suggestions to go with other options for 2-3 months while preparing my wife for IVF with necessary medication and lifestyle changes.  Ovum pickup was done in the month of November and the Embryos were frozen. She then checked for the best situation (health/lining/mental preparedness etc.) for next  2-3 months and then finally did the Embryo Transplant in the first week of March. She waited for Dec/Jan/Feb to ensure the best suitable body condition for the ET in order to avoid any kind of risks. She doesn't compromised on that even when we were asking her to do ET early. She explained us all the reasons whenever asked and we were satisfied by her explanations always.

Finally, we got the reports for my wife's pregnancy and it's positive!! We are so very happy/excited and are so grateful to Dr. Radhika who brought happiness to our lives!!
Thank you Dr. Radhika!! You are God's sent Angel for us!! Thank you so much!!

Under these circumstances, what we look for is an expert in treating the infertility problem.

Doctor Radhika is a perfect blend of these. Being skeptical, we used to ask her many questions and She is very patient in addressing all and never rushed the appointments. After our failed IUI cycles, we would like to consider other alternatives like Ayurveda before getting into IVF (Because of its cost and hormonal medications). Doctor was very supportive, didnt discourage us even a little bit about this. After six months, we went back to her for IVF. What we saw in IVF was truly a miracle, thanks to all the scientists and our doctor, we are pregnant now.
