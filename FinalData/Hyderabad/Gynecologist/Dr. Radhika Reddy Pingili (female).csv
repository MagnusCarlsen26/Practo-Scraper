"Treatment satisfaction,",,0,0,YES,"I was married in 2018. Soon after my marriage, I was diagnosed with tuberculosis, It was a 7 months treatment. Amidst the treatment, I conceived.

I was 5 weeks 6 days pregnant And, we were advised by the doctor to abort the baby, we took opinion of pulmonologist too but he advised us the same. So with a heavy heart we had to go for MTP. Post MTP, I suffered from various health issues (thyroid, anemia‚Ä¶) I worked on my health. Got all the tests done again and then tried to conceive. We tried for 2-3 years, but didn‚Äôt get any positive result. 
Then we decided to consult a infertility specialist and hence we reached out to Dr. Radhika. After our first meeting with the doctor, we had immense trust in her as she was approachable, honest and forthright. She explained us everything well in the initial appointments that later we didn‚Äôt had any questions to ask but just the faith in her expertise. She advised her to go for IVF ICSI and counselled us briefly about the same. It was a costly affair but all worth it.

So be patient and stay positive. That‚Äôs what worked for me.
We have been trying to conceive for 8 years. I have been struggling with PCOD due to which I had unbalanced hormone issues. I did stimulated ovulation cycles, ovarian drilling but no result. Then shifted to Hyderabad and looked for an IVF specialist nearby online. That‚Äôs how I met my doc Dr. Radhika Reddy Pingli. She was very polite, positive, calm and reassuring that we will go down this path together to help me conceive. We straightaway asked for IVF as we had waited for a long time.
We conceived the first time (1st FET) itself, but unfortunately I had early miscarriage naturally. My beta HCG levels dropped. That‚Äôs when it hit me badly as if I can never be a mother. But I kept my patience and I had to face the failure for next 2 FETs as well. 3 failed FETs and I was heartbroken but I did not lose my hope and my trust on Dr. Radhika. As she said, she really walked down this path with us. She understood my emotional situation, always offered positive advice and was always available on phone outside the hospital hours. She adapted to changes in my treatment to provide the best for me. She is very friendly and a good listener. We are blessed and I am 7 months pregnant right now. Though my conceiving journey was also a bit tensed but she helped me get through the first 5 months smoothly and I could see the happiness on her face too, which showed her concern for me. She helped us to choose a gynaecologist to continue with.
Thanks to Dr. Radhika, it‚Äôs my dream come true to be a mother. Though it took us more than a year due to this pandemic situation and 3 FET failures but all's well that ends well.
