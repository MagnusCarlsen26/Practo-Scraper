,,0,0,YES," I went to the ER about 2 years ago thinking I broke my leg. We get there and get x-rays pretty quickly. We had to wait for ever after they took the x-rays. My mom posted on Facebook that we were in the ER. She is friends with my orthopedic surgeon on Facebook,(we have known her forever and love her to death.) My orthopedic surgeon saw the post and came to the ER to see me. She ended up being the one to reveal that I had a VERY large tumor in my leg that was causing the pain and that there was a chance part of my leg could have to be amputated for to the size and location of the tumor. She prayed and cried with us that night and performed the surgery the next afternoon. I came out of surgery with 2 full legs and a  story to tell. I am 16 now and hope to become a orthopedic surgeon to follow in her footsteps. ",2023-05-26 13:53:46,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
