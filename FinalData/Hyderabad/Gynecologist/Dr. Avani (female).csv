None,"Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Avani after meeting with a few doctors and from the beginning we had positive vibes. She is one of the best infertility experts in Hyderabad. She is always very thorough with her diagnosis and gives detailed guidance with explanation. We had many complications but she helped us navigate through all of it and helped us conceive via IVF. We would surely recommend her with any fertility related concerns.

None,None,0,0,YES,"Dr. Avani is such a terrific doctor. She is patient and understanding and made us feel like we were heard and not simply another number. She answered all our questions. Dr. Avani is such a great, informed doctor and is well worth it. Our first appointment with her was in 2022, then she was extremely thorough with her diagnosis for us. She provided us with options of what we wanted to continue ahead with. In 2023, my wife is pregnant with 10 weeks now. We are incredibly appreciative and thankful to Dr. Avani. Dr. Avani has been an answer to our prayers. We highly recommend her and if we could give her more than five stars we would definitely.

And thank you to all the nurses, especially Gopi (receptionist) who is always very attentive, helpful and well informed, great job Gopi; you guys are awesome!
