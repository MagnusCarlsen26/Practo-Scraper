We tried to reach them after conception and the response was extremely poor. Imagine the anxiety the mother is going through. We did not receive a response until we had to pay for the call which is fine but the way it was done was extremely disheartening for us. Even after we paid and promised an appointment we had to follow multiple times for the call. Again, very poor expectation settings.
