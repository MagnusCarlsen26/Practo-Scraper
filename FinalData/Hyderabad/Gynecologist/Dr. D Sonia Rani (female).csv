We had a 1-2 minute discussion and after that she thought these guys may not proceed at her clinic and simply said ""if you can get the MTP outside you take it yourself but she said she will not assist my wife for any bleeding or other issues and she pressed the calling bell for next patient"". We felt its very absud, she didn't actually cared about my wife's health. *** ***** **** ***** ** ** ***** ******* *** ** ** ******** ***** **** *** * ** * ************ *** * ** ********** ****** *** ******* *** *** *** ********** *** ** *****
