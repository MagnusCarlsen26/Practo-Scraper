Thanks for believing and continuing your treatment with us. You took treatment under me for initial few years and then left and went to the corporate IVF centres in Hyderabad. Had treatments there and returned back to us.

And in this 9 years of your association with me have you ever come across a single day that I was on leave? No. That’s my commitment towards my patients and if today on one day Iwas not available you should have just trusted that I would have arranged an equally qualified and responsible doctor to carry out all procedures of IUI/ IVF. So the receptionist will just manage opd and not aware of whom I have given responsibility. Our centre has 3 Reproductive Medicine specialists all completed their Full time fellowship in Infertility and not just gynaecologists.

About my experience,  the wait times at the hospital are at least 45 mins from appointment time, without exception.  The nurses will not tell anything in a coherent manner and you will be running between ground and first floor for payment and consultation.  Ultimately when you meet the doctor,  she will be very busy won't be able to give more than 5-6 minutes,  and will also be on phone sometime within these 5-6 minutes.  So,  my precious time and money was wasted in visiting this hospital. ",2016-08-20 06:51:28,False,False,Mr. Avijeet Singh,,,

Thank you for your review. Infertility case history taking is for a couple hence takes longer and some patients have a huge volume of diagnostic reports and treatment records which all needs to be recorded. This consultation is also done by a post fellowship doctor specialised in infertility. Then there is counseling required regarding evaluation and treatment plans. All of this takes a minimum of 1-1.5 hrs. The decision of this is taken post a scan. Actually you book a consultation slot and come and when you need a scan you will need a new slot as we have continuos scan appointments already but we adjust your slot in between them. Now after scan you need to show that report to me and this is actually another consultation slot being given to you on the same day. Post this the couple will be advised certain investigations and will come back later for report review which is again free within 10days. So all this is not compulsory to be done same day and you can book your appointment for scan at a convenient date and time and again book a slot for review later again. But with Hyderabad traffic your travel time three times will be much more than the time you spent in your first visit. So we have actually given you three appointments with one booking for the day. We are doing all this for your convenience but you can always decide what works best for you.",2018-10-17T08:32:55+0000,Dr. Vandana Hegde

She calmly listen to patient's problems, answers all their queries with smiling face and that's what makes patients feel confident.

The kind of treatment and medical prescription advised by her was really very good which helped me control my PCOD problem and finally helped me conceive and now I am blessed with twins baby.
