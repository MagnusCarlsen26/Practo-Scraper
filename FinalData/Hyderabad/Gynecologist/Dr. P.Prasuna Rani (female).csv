None,"Gynae Problems,",0,0,YES,"i remembered the saying "" whatever happens, happens for good"".
Earlier i booked appointment with vandana hegde( hegde hospital) which didnt turn in to a positive outcome because some other doctor medicated as vandana was busy.
so i ws in totally angry mood , discussing the same with one of my friend ,he suggested me for prasuna rani . i was not sure that whether meeting this time with the doctor will make me satisfied or not.

As soon as i reached to the hospital, nurse took the file and asked me to wait for 30 minutes, as number if patient were around 5.
i feel very good that it seems doctor gives time to their patients which is very good for patient.
she was continuously visiting ultrasound room also which is adjacent to the doctors room to attend the ultrasound patient.
when my number came, me and my wif entered in to the chamber , she was welcoming us by a wide smile. she made us very comfortable by listening us the whole thing and gave very good suggestions.
