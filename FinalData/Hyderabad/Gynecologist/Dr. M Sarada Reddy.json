But, what really makes her stand out is how she made me feel like I was her only patient and that she would spend as much time with me as I needed. she was incredibly thorough in not only asking me about my history, but in explaining all my options. she called before my surgery to see if I had any more questions, and she called several times after to see how I was doing and to update me on the results. she emphasized that I should feel free to contact her any time with any questions. I think the highest compliment one can give a doctor is that they treat a patient like a member of their family and Dr. Sarada did that for me. I feel so lucky to have found her!",
