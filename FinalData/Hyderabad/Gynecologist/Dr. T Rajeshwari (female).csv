Your entire team and I must mention Dr Pragnya Garu, Dr Vithal Garu, Dr Pawan Garu and Dr Jaisimha Garu for creating confidence in us with caring, gentle, and understanding nature. My wife who is 52 years old was in perimenopausal stage had Molar Pregnancy/Gestational Trophoblastic Disease with 18 weeks uterus size along with Thyrotoxic Storm which triggered cardiac issues, respiratory distress, high Beta HCG and had very high BP was in trauma and we were badly worried.
With my wife being in high risk condition and Dr Rajeswari Garu going ahead with this option of surgery was commendable which was completed in lesser time with less bleeding and no stiches at all, mobilized in a day. I can see my wife is recovering sooner and all the tests getting done on daily basis.
Having said that, I would like to see improvement the way patients are handled at MRI and CT Scan sections. More staff needs to be deployed so that patients are given minimum strain while they are placed at MRI/CT Scan platforms. This will surely be a huge value addition.
I wish Dr Rajeswari Garu and her entire team at Care Hosptial Gachibowli the best to keep the good work and save more lives.
