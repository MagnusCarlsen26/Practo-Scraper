"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hysterectomy (Abdominal/Vaginal),",0,0,YES,"Dear Dr Rajeswari Garu – Million thanks to you and your entire team for giving us the much-needed counselling and creating confidence to go ahead with surgery “Emergency Non-Descent vaginal hysterectomy” in just 20 minutes which we were not able to decide in last 24 hours. Your entire team and I must mention Dr Pragnya Garu, Dr Vithal Garu, Dr Pawan Garu and Dr Jaisimha Garu for creating confidence in us with caring, gentle, and understanding nature. My wife who is 52 years old was in perimenopausal stage had Molar Pregnancy/Gestational Trophoblastic Disease with 18 weeks uterus size along with Thyrotoxic Storm which triggered cardiac issues, respiratory distress, high Beta HCG and had very high BP was in trauma and we were badly worried.
With my wife being in high risk condition and Dr Rajeswari Garu going ahead with this option of surgery was commendable which was completed in lesser time with less bleeding and no stiches at all, mobilized in a day. I can see my wife is recovering sooner and all the tests getting done on daily basis.
Having said that, I would like to see improvement the way patients are handled at MRI and CT Scan sections. More staff needs to be deployed so that patients are given minimum strain while they are placed at MRI/CT Scan platforms. This will surely be a huge value addition.
I wish Dr Rajeswari Garu and her entire team at Care Hosptial Gachibowli the best to keep the good work and save more lives.

Consultation fees is decided by organisation which includes infrastructure/ receptionist, nurse, AC/chair, lift, parking/ security and many more such things, it’s not just for doctor.
You were given enough time. The problem is patients want to come in 2 nd time 3rd time to again ask for medicines , tests etc, kindly be empathetic to us and give full attention while we explain to you. We have other patients who write that we made them wait……so time has to be respected. I never rush consultation and always wait for patients to finish their side. If google can help you more than doctors plz go ahead and feel free to use it. No doctor is a encyclopaedia….Plz don’t be so unreasonable.",2023-04-04T01:18:51+0000,Dr. T Rajeshwari
