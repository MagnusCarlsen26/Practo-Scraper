"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I have been consulting with Dr. Roopa Ghanta for almost 6 years. During pregnancy also I consulted her and my experience was very good, our little princess saw her first light on 12 May 2020. I delivered baby during Covid-19 pandemic situation and was little afraid. Me and my husband were alone and due to Covid-19, no one from our family was able to come. Doctor has been very supportive in this situation and tried to calm me down always if I was in tention. She does not scare much and told us how to take care of myself and baby during pregnancy. She does not explain things in too much details and try to keep things point to point, does not scare much, which we liked. She answers our questions and doubts pretty well. I have the habit of reading and getting all the info, so was not depending on doctor for everything. But if some people want to completely depend on doctor, then they should ask themself with doctor their doubts. If we ask anything, she eill explain nicely.. She always used to repond on whatsapp if I ask any question which was very much needed in this pandamic situation. Many times i was able to resolve my queries on whatsapp which avoided going to hospital on this Covid situation. Even now after my delivery, if i ask her anything on whatsapp she still helps me.Overall i can say i am happy with doctor the way she has helped me during my pregnency journey.",2020-09-27 15:17:11,False,True,Shilpi Varshney,,,
