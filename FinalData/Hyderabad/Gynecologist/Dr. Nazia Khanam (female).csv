"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,I have visited doctor on 19th for my wife pregnancy checkup as well for Viral fever. Her health went really bad so had to consult the doctor again on 22nd (Like within 4 days of earlier consultation). Today before visiting the hospital I have contacted the front desk team they informed doctor will be available between 6pm - 8pm. Now the time is close to 7:30 pm the doctors presence is no where. For any doctors (or any professional person) time sense is very important especially for doctors you cannot take someones health for granted if she cant manage her time there should be someone else. The only reason I’m waiting is because I already consulted this doctor so donna try another doctor with different medication. This would be last time I visit this hospital. The management needs to address these on a high note. Thank you! ,2019-07-22 15:24:13,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
