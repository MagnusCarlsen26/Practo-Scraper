We visited multiple fertility centres for five years before coming to Nova but all in vain as almost all the fertility centres intimidated us in the name of age factor and directly suggested to go for IVF treatment and as a last attempt we visited Dr Chandana and she is the first doctor who suggested to go for IUI instead of IVF and we are happy to share that in the first attempt of IUI the result came out positive and my wife is pregnant now. Though pregnancy is a long journey getting the ***** treatment from the right doctor is very important as well and Dr Chandana came to our rescue when we were really stressed out due to infertility.

Dr Chandana is an excellent doctor and she made us comfortable with detailed explanation about the treatment. Dr Chandana treats her patients with empathy as most of the couples are in a state of depression because of infertility and I strongly believe if you come across the right doctor you can overcome infertility and Dr Chandana rightly fits the bill in terms of a perfect doctor.

Dr Chandana patiently listens to her patients concerns and will always help in clearing her patients doubts. We are extremely happy with her treatment and she is really a ray of hope for wannabe moms.
