None,None,0,0,NO,"All the doctor visits went smoothly leading me to believe that the delivery would also be dealt with professionally. This doctor and clinic was also recommended by our close family doctor so I did not have any second thoughts.  The doctor was available thoughout on email and phone as well. I was told that since my cervix was short and the baby was big, normal delivery was difficult but they would still try. However, the list of things that went wrong is very long:

1. I had asked about epidurals several times during the visits, but at no point was I made aware that epidurals are an option for C-sections as well
2. I stopped feeling my baby's movements the day before the due date. March 23, 2014. This had happened once before during which I was given IV and and baby's heart rate was monitored to ensure that all was well, and I had started feeling the movements again. This time, however, I rushed to the hospital and the same procedures were repeated. The scan conducted at this point was clear. However, I could not feel the movements all night and still was given an option to go back home and return the next day, which I refused.
3. The next morning after an entire night of feeling no movements, I was taken for a scan where it was detected that there were specs indicating the baby had pooped inside my tummy (meconium). This meant that the delivery needed to be done immediately before the baby ingested any of the meconium
4. The hospital delayed the delivery even after this by 2.5 hours, scheduling other c-sections before mine. I was wheeled into the anesthetic room and asked to make a decision if I wanted to opt for an epidural in addition to the spinal injection that would be given, but was never made aware of the pros and cons earlier, making my decision very difficult at that point. And as I was slipping into the effect of the meds, I could hear the anesthetists discussing jewellery and other topics, including how they had ended up using the wrong size needle etc. for my spinal, instead of trying to tell me what I should expect to feel, how long it would take!
5. The c-section was performed and it was found that my baby had in fact swallowed the meconium, and had to be immediately shifted into special care, pumping out his lungs, making the birth experience traumatic for him as well. I was able to see my son after those initial few seconds only 2 days later. The baby came out stuggling, the pediatrician was shaking his head saying this was not looking good.
6. Further, the epidural levels were not monitored properly leading to my falling into a  psychedelic delirium 2-3 times (including on the operating table right after the delivery and during the post delivery time  the next day) much like one experienced when one is on drugs or a sci-fi movie when you are falling into a bottomless kaliedoscope-like well. 
7. The next couple of days I experienced headaches so acute, for which they prescribed medication including a form of ibuprufin that I had specifically warned the resident doctors that I was allergic to. This led to an allergic reaction causing my having swollen up eyes and continuous sneezing which is very painful when you have just had your stomach stitched up.

It was utter negligence on the hospital's part to not have taken swift action after I went well in advance having detected lack of movements when my child was already full term. And this was further enhanced when  even after detecting my unclear scan, patients were wheeled in ahead of me and the hospital took their own sweet time for my operation. 

My discharge notes also did not contain any mention of the meconium, calling the child as normal on all parameters, that I had to go and specifically get corrected few days later, to reflect the correct information. 

Would not recommend to anyone. In fact this experience has put me off the idea of having any further babies. Thankfully  my son is healthy now against all these odds (having been an unusually colicky baby with trouble with sleep as well during the first 1.5 years of his life.)",2016-09-06 06:58:41,False,False,Aishwarya,,,
