"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF),",0,0,YES,"Background: We reached out to multiple doctors to get a second opinion as our case was tagged as unexplained infertility by an expert doctor. We are located in hitech city so there were many top doctors nearby yet I consulted with Dr. Parinaaz from Oasis Secunderabad as we had a friend reference and also I saw her YouTube video on Unexplained Infertility which was helpful. She was the only doctor who was approachable and gave her suggestions for our case on direct phone call without any formal consultations and asked me to come on Day 2. In my first consultation itself she took time to go through our entire file, she mentioned she understood our history well and identified reasons and discussed the possible line of treatment. With this consultation itself we got 100% confidence and decided to go ahead.\n\nDoctor highlights: Once we were in, Dr. Parinaaz gave her best suggestions that were relevant to our history to ensure we get the positive result as soon as possible. No matter how many patients are present, she has a complete grip on our case and ensures she will check things personally at key milestones and communicate with us. She always went above and beyond in my case right from injection suggestions to converting medicated FET cycle to natural cycle FET to get better results. Natural cycle FET is heavy on logistics for any doctor as it is easy to miss out the ovulation window if not tracked closely but the doctor made this choice to give the best result to us for which we are forever thankful. Even the embryo transfer process was rushed through in our best interest as the embryo started hatching early. We got positive results in our first cycle itself. We are forever thankful to Dr. Parinaaz for all the knowledge, love, attention and care for making this miracle possible. All in all I am sharing all the key highlights so you can understand that Dr. Parinaaz gives her best efforts to give you best results. \n\nClinic Values:\nFrom my and fellow patients' experience Oasis Secunderabad under Dr. Parinaaz guidance delivers the following values:\n\n100% transparency: Everything from treatment options to reports to finances all the details are shared with you and communicated.\n\nGiving 200% best: They will work according to the patient\u2019s best interest instead of optimizing it for the doctor\u2019s timing which is mostly the case at big clinics.\n\nPersonalized care: Most of the other clinics follow a standard approach to all the patients and always their interest is to extend the number of cycles but this clinic and doctor takes a personalized approach to your case and delivers the best result in the shortest time.\n\nSpecial Thankyou:\nOf all the junior doctors, we love Dr. Nirzaana\u2019s consultation as her attention to details are perfect and her answers to our questions are assertive which helps us take action. I remember getting my periods early for a hysteroscopy and I felt like taking a break and mentioned it to her. She mentioned getting pregnant was the best break I can get so she suggested that I be excited, which I can never forget as that assurance gave me so much positivity to carry on without a break. \n\nThe pharmacist, Shobhan gaaru, always went above and beyond for us from start to finish. For the routine injections we chose to go to Miyapur branch as it was near to us. He coordinated with the team to ensure there is no hassle or delay for us. He also helped us get the emergency medicines when there was a need and pushed their staff to execute it on time. \n\nFinance team: Mr. Sai and Mrs. Madhavi gaaru, they were always there for us to keep the process and financials transparent, easy and hassle free. \n\nGlory & Hasita: Thank you so much for always getting my key questions addressed by coordinating with the doctors. \n\nOasis Staff: My husband and I want to convey a special thank you to each and every staff member right from ayyammas, sisters, receptionists, finance team, pharmacy team, junior doctors for all your love and support throughout the treatment.",2022-09-17 14:21:49,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
