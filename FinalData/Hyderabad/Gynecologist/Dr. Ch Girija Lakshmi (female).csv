On 22nd oct, my water broke and i contacted birthplace emergency and they have asked me to come hospital immediately. By the time i reached hospital..i was wondered by the reception i received right from the security, front desk people to duty doctors and nurses.This gesture of birthplace from all the staff is highly appreciable.Dr Girija has been continuously monitoring my status over the phone.Though i was confirmed with significantly low AFI...my Dr. has taken a call of continuing the ongoing natural delivery process unlike rushing for C section in any other hospitals.I am ever grateful for Dr Girija for taking this call and  for putting  confidence in me that i would deliver vaginally.Dr Girija has comforted me and made my dream of delivering naturally into reality at 9:59 pm.As soon as i delivered, Dr Madhavi has monitored my baby and told us my baby was doing good.We liked the way whole team of birthplace has customised the labor process.
I was worried as to how i would manage post delivery  as single attendee was allowed as part of covid protocol but all my apprehensions were put to bay after experiencing the continuous care from the sisters and ayammas.Literally me and my husband were impressed by the facility of providing two separate nurses for mother and child who have taken care us from time to time and were a call away.
We thank birthplace for providing beautiful experience in bringing our little bundle of joy to this world.
