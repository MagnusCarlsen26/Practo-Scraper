None,None,0,0,YES,"Reshma mam is such a friendly and understanding doctor. I never thought I'll have normal delivery because of my situation from beginning of my pregnancy itself but mam encouraged me so much that I can have normal delivery if I put efforts. After delivery also mam personally gave lot of suggestions for my recovery. She keeps on monitoring her patients very closely by clearing all our doubts. I'm very much happy with her service. Thank you mam
