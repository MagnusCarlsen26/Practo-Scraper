Initially we consulted Swathi mam for Pregnancy confirmation and for counselling regarding covid situations. She listened patiently about our questions and clearly explained that there is no need to worry due to covid(About Vaccination/Hospitalization/Baby Health....)

After speaking to her we are clear that COVID is not a constraint for continuing with pregnancy. There on we continued for monthly checkups and also when required. In every consultation she explained about reports of both mother and baby health.

Unfortunately we need to plan our delivery in my hometown but not in Hyderabad, so we moved to our hometown after 8th month consultation. In last consultation also she guided what needs to be done for remaining months.

Last week we blessed with Baby Boy, both mother and child are doing good.

1.Went through the records , as per the data we have, only the NT scan was done with us.
2.Not all cardiac anomalies can be diagnosed on NT scan.
3.Most importantly I was not the person who did the scan.
4.I know my capabilities and responsibilities quite well. 
5.I always insist that anomaly scan and fetal 2D ECHO should be done at a tertiary centre, but some patients donâ€™t ,for reasons best known to them.
6.Again the TIFFA here in your case was NOT DONE BY ME.
7.You did not follow with us after that.
 
I can understand the pain of delivering a baby with congenital heart disease BUT YOU CANNOT BLAME AN OBSTETRICIAN FOR SOMETHING NOT REPORTED BY THE RADIOLOGIST.

1.All relevant investigations at that stage of pregnancy were advised but only some were done for reasons best known to you.
2. Timely Ultrasound was advised 
but it was delayed by 3 days for reasons best known to you.
3. I hope you appreciate the fact that the doctor has taken every effort to talk to you and examine you(even outside the regular clinic consultation hours) and advised you to visit the hospital immediately as the scan was abnormal. But you did not( reason again best known to you).
4. It is the duty of the doctor to explain everything to the patient (not demotivate) and caution her ,especially when something is not going right.
5. After all this, blaming a doctor for ?scar ectopic/?miscarriage is very unprofessional.
