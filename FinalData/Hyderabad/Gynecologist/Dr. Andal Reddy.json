However, I am happy to say that my experience with Dr. Andal was incredibly positive and, for the most part, painless. Dr. Andal is not only a highly skilled surgeon who performs complex surgeries with great success, but she is also exceptionally friendly and empathetic. She truly understands patients' fears and goes above and beyond to ensure that the entire experience is as comfortable and pain-free as possible. Additionally, she is very approachable, answered my questions when needed even over the phone, and visited me post-surgery even on a Sunday to make sure I was doing well. Thank you, Dr. Andal, for making my surgery experience pleasant and painless.",

She always greets us with a smile and she remembers all our medical history. She has so much positivity in her that our worries/tensions will go away after talking to her. She will listen to all our questions and answers them very clearly. She will make things look light instead of scaring the patients. Just because of Dr Andal Reddy, I decided to have my delivery in Hyderabad instead of my hometown. She used to be available on phone all the time which is a very positive thing about her. I would highly recommend her to all of you who are reading my review. You can close your eyes and go visit the doctor and have a safe delivery. My delivery happened on a festival day when she is on leave and on hearing my status from duty doctor, she rushed to hospital at the right  moment within very less time(though she stays far). Iwish she could be a pediatrician as well so that I would take my kid also to her peacefully :P (just joke but I really wish for it :-)) A simple thanks will not be sufficient for her. Thank you sooooo much mam for making me have a happy and safe delivery and making my pregnancy days go smooth. :-)",

She explains things very nicely and not the kind of doctor who writes many tests for no reason.  She had to attend me very early in the morning for the delivery, yet she came in and talked me through the rough labor pains. Unlike many other doctors (heard from my friends), she tries out for normal delivery only. So, I strongly recommend her, especially if you are going to be mom for the first time.  She is awesome. ",

She truly understands patients' fears and goes above and beyond to ensure that the entire experience is as comfortable and pain-free as possible. Additionally, she is very approachable, answered my questions when needed even over the phone, and visited me post-surgery even on a Sunday to make sure I was doing well.

She always greets us with a smile and she remembers all our medical history. She has so much positivity in her that our worries/tensions will go away after talking to her. She will listen to all our questions and answers them very clearly. She will make things look light instead of scaring the patients. Just because of Dr Andal Reddy, I decided to have my delivery in Hyderabad instead of my hometown. She used to be available on phone all the time which is a very positive thing about her. I would highly recommend her to all of you who are reading my review. You can close your eyes and go visit the doctor and have a safe delivery. My delivery happened on a festival day when she is on leave and on hearing my status from duty doctor, she rushed to hospital at the right  moment within very less time(though she stays far). Iwish she could be a pediatrician as well so that I would take my kid also to her peacefully :P (just joke but I really wish for it :-)) A simple thanks will not be sufficient for her. Thank you sooooo much mam for making me have a happy and safe delivery and making my pregnancy days go smooth. :-)",

She explains things very nicely and not the kind of doctor who writes many tests for no reason.  She had to attend me very early in the morning for the delivery, yet she came in and talked me through the rough labor pains. Unlike many other doctors (heard from my friends), she tries out for normal delivery only. So, I strongly recommend her, especially if you are going to be mom for the first time.  She is awesome. ",

Now me and my baby are all good. She has a very pleasant nature. A part from all these, she\u2019s extremely experienced and talented  to handle her job with ease. Anything related to post pregnancy consultation, I am going to her with all love and confidence irrespective of the hospital she\u2019s working with. ( She is now with Citizens). \n\n100% I recommend her.  Any one for a happy delivery go choose her as your doctor. \n\n",
