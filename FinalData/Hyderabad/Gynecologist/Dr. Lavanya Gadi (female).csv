None,None,0,0,YES,"********* ******* i would recommend Dr Lavanya to anyone who wants a treatment with utmost care  and earnestness. If you are in Hyderabad and looking for a gynaecologist , please do visit her without second thoughts.
Earlier we were consulting other doctors during my wifeâ€™s 1st trimester of pregnancy, but we did not have much satisfaction. Fortunately I came across Dr Lavanya in Satyasree Clinic and that changed our pregnancy journey for the better. The way she started the treatment process and gave a detailed solution to our problems and concerns is really satisfactory. We were a bit afraid about normal delivery and thought of going for C section due to age old myths and influences around us, but Dr Lavanya gave us the courage of going for normal painless delivery and the outcome was a healthy delivery process. Even the medications that she prescribed throughout the period of pregnancy was awesome and effective. We as a family is really happy to have consulted Dr Lavanya. Thank you doctor :)",2020-09-23 20:30:51,False,True,SOMRIK CHOUDHURY,,,
