We were hesitant and scared to get pregnant again after a traumatic ectopic pregnancy, and when we discussed it with her, she was very polite and assured us to take a step forward. Our journey with Doctor began then and there, and there hasn't been a single day since that I haven't thanked her:).\n\nShe was always available and there for us, regardless of her busy schedule, and she is very patient in listening to all of our concerns and questions. She treats her patients like family and goes above and beyond to assist them.\n\n I successfully conceived without any medication or any treatment  and had a happy pregnancy until 7th month but then unfortunately went into labour at 31 weeks for unknown reasons ( had my baby#1 till full term) and was also hit by Covid at the same time, leaving me unsure what to do, but Dr. Chandana, despite her health condition, reassured me and arrived at the hospital within minutes, standing by my side throughout my delivery and ensuring I was all in good health until the baby was delivered. She also assisted us in having the baby via VBAC, which I had never imagined or dreamed of. She was always a phone call away from the start, until I recovered from my pregnancy, and even now!\n\nA doctor like Dr. Chandana is extremely rare and difficult to come by, and she is a true treasure. Thank you, Doctor, for your devotion and assistance during this journey; we will be eternally grateful!! I wish you the best of luck!!",

Prior to that, it was a very critical time for us as all known sources indicate conception in PCOS becomes difficult.Dr Chandana was very supportive, and assuring at all times that all will go well.Amidst that I had also suffered from covid and post covid symptoms. However, Dr. Chandana always found time to reassure us and build our confidence that there isn't anything to worry about.She is very knowledgeable and experienced and her diagnosis and treatments worked like a charm.She is always very approachable, friendly and cordial throughout the entire process; always looking out to ease the tension and worries of her patients. Within a few months of being consulting with her, we were able to conceive.Dr. Chandana Ma'am has been very helpful throughout the pregnancy process with the regular health checkups and for any sort of issues; she always makes her best efforts to ooze away the anxieties; most importantly, she always makes herself available for her patients. Moreover, she will always patiently listen to whatever doubt or queries we have and resolves everything that we have in our mind.At her clinic, we never have to wait for more than 10-15 minutes to visit her; besides, the staff there is also very friendly, cooperative and provide a personalized experience.Now we have been blessed with our new born just some time back. The delivery was also performed by Dr. Chandana and her team at Rainbow Hospital, where she is a visiting consultant.In my case it had to be a C-section due to stature related medical reasons, or else Dr. Chandana Ma'am wanted to take the normal delivery approach; I was very worried initially about how things would fare. However, with Dr. Chandana at our side, we were rest assured that things will go well and they did !We have been very lucky to have been under Dr. Chandana's guidance and consultation at Satyasree clinics.She is my dedicated gynaecologist and for anyone looking for a trusted gynaecologist, I recommend Dr. Chandana wholeheartedly.P.S. \\\" Thank you Ma'am for always being there for us and not just as a doctor, but as a friend and a guide; we are both highly grateful to you. Wish you the very best always. \\",

I was referred to Dr Chandana from my office colleague  here in New Jersey. We had a video consultation initially , she was one most caring Doctors, listened patiently to all my queries & addressed each of them. Her calm assuring presence is what my mom liked the most & she decided to get the surgery done in Rainbow hospital.  With travel restrictions in place in 2021, I couldn't come down to India, but the detailed plan she wrote to me gave me enough peace to stay back & let my mom go through surgery.\nMy personal interaction with Dr Chandana a couple of years later was for my very own 2nd child planning after we moved back to Hyderabad. She gave me a real insight into my issues and made me understand that these issues are common and can be treated. She gave us that confidence to plan for our 2nd child as I was above 36yrs.\nBeing a Gold medallist in her subject from one of the top university in India really shows in the quality of care I got. It's not about peppy talk but it's the knowledge & the skill she shows is what impressed me & my husband alike.\nWe have another 3 months to go for the child to come but I can heap a ton of praises for this wonderful doctor.

She was also particular that we will try for normal.

She was able to assess my conditions perfectly and decide on my treatment including mode of delivery. She was very professional and always available on the fixed appointment time and date. I never waited more than 30 minutes for my consultation during my entire pregnancy check up at her clinic. During my delivery and post delivery period also she made sure that everything happens as planned and hassle free and my family members also grew fond of her.  She is available after 5.30pm on Monday to Saturday and from 11am on Sundays in her clinic, which is another favorable condition for working women like me. Her clinic is in very much accessible area and her staffs are very polite and cooperative too. Dr. Chandana is my trusted Gynecologist and if anyone is looking for a good Gynecologist,  I recommend her whole heartedly.",

We got pregnant the first month of consultation itself.Dr. Chandana is very patient in explaining all the medical terms during monthly checkups.I was diagnosed with Pre-eclampsia in week 33 which is considered as high risk pregnancy and the risk is for both me and the baby. I am thankful to her for timely diagnosis and the treatment. I had planned C Section as soon as I entered 37 weeks as per her recommendation. She was very supportive during those last few weeks, she responds timely on calls and WhatsApp for any queries. Then immense medical and moral support she gave me inside Operation theater was unforgettable. Today 10 weeks postpartum, I still consult her and take her advise. Today me, my baby and my family are grateful to found her. I highly recommend her and she is the one for those who want to have their OBGs explain them the medical terms, have their worries cleared instead of simply writing prescriptions..Lastly Satyasree clinic is well maintained clinic with good response from staff for appointments and followups. Good support with diagnostic center. ",

We were hesitant and scared to get pregnant again after a traumatic ectopic pregnancy, and when we discussed it with her, she was very polite and assured us to take a step forward. Our journey with Doctor began then and there, and there hasn't been a single day since that I haven't thanked her:).\n\nShe was always available and there for us, regardless of her busy schedule, and she is very patient in listening to all of our concerns and questions. She treats her patients like family and goes above and beyond to assist them.\n\n I successfully conceived without any medication or any treatment  and had a happy pregnancy until 7th month but then unfortunately went into labour at 31 weeks for unknown reasons ( had my baby#1 till full term) and was also hit by Covid at the same time, leaving me unsure what to do, but Dr. Chandana, despite her health condition, reassured me and arrived at the hospital within minutes, standing by my side throughout my delivery and ensuring I was all in good health until the baby was delivered. She also assisted us in having the baby via VBAC, which I had never imagined or dreamed of. She was always a phone call away from the start, until I recovered from my pregnancy, and even now!\n\nA doctor like Dr. Chandana is extremely rare and difficult to come by, and she is a true treasure. Thank you, Doctor, for your devotion and assistance during this journey; we will be eternally grateful!! I wish you the best of luck!!",

Prior to that, it was a very critical time for us as all known sources indicate conception in PCOS becomes difficult.Dr Chandana was very supportive, and assuring at all times that all will go well.Amidst that I had also suffered from covid and post covid symptoms. However, Dr. Chandana always found time to reassure us and build our confidence that there isn't anything to worry about.She is very knowledgeable and experienced and her diagnosis and treatments worked like a charm.She is always very approachable, friendly and cordial throughout the entire process; always looking out to ease the tension and worries of her patients. Within a few months of being consulting with her, we were able to conceive.Dr. Chandana Ma'am has been very helpful throughout the pregnancy process with the regular health checkups and for any sort of issues; she always makes her best efforts to ooze away the anxieties; most importantly, she always makes herself available for her patients. Moreover, she will always patiently listen to whatever doubt or queries we have and resolves everything that we have in our mind.At her clinic, we never have to wait for more than 10-15 minutes to visit her; besides, the staff there is also very friendly, cooperative and provide a personalized experience.Now we have been blessed with our new born just some time back. The delivery was also performed by Dr. Chandana and her team at Rainbow Hospital, where she is a visiting consultant.In my case it had to be a C-section due to stature related medical reasons, or else Dr. Chandana Ma'am wanted to take the normal delivery approach; I was very worried initially about how things would fare. However, with Dr. Chandana at our side, we were rest assured that things will go well and they did !We have been very lucky to have been under Dr. Chandana's guidance and consultation at Satyasree clinics.She is my dedicated gynaecologist and for anyone looking for a trusted gynaecologist, I recommend Dr. Chandana wholeheartedly.P.S. \\\" Thank you Ma'am for always being there for us and not just as a doctor, but as a friend and a guide; we are both highly grateful to you. Wish you the very best always. \\",

I was referred to Dr Chandana from my office colleague  here in New Jersey. We had a video consultation initially , she was one most caring Doctors, listened patiently to all my queries & addressed each of them. Her calm assuring presence is what my mom liked the most & she decided to get the surgery done in Rainbow hospital.  With travel restrictions in place in 2021, I couldn't come down to India, but the detailed plan she wrote to me gave me enough peace to stay back & let my mom go through surgery.\nMy personal interaction with Dr Chandana a couple of years later was for my very own 2nd child planning after we moved back to Hyderabad. She gave me a real insight into my issues and made me understand that these issues are common and can be treated. She gave us that confidence to plan for our 2nd child as I was above 36yrs.\nBeing a Gold medallist in her subject from one of the top university in India really shows in the quality of care I got. It's not about peppy talk but it's the knowledge & the skill she shows is what impressed me & my husband alike.\nWe have another 3 months to go for the child to come but I can heap a ton of praises for this wonderful doctor.

But, the moment your turn comes, the amount of quality time given by the physician is what comes to your mind and makes you more confident and happy.\n\nSince my first pregnancy was a normal. She was also particular that we will try for normal.

She was able to assess my conditions perfectly and decide on my treatment including mode of delivery. She was very professional and always available on the fixed appointment time and date. I never waited more than 30 minutes for my consultation during my entire pregnancy check up at her clinic. During my delivery and post delivery period also she made sure that everything happens as planned and hassle free and my family members also grew fond of her.  She is available after 5.30pm on Monday to Saturday and from 11am on Sundays in her clinic, which is another favorable condition for working women like me. Her clinic is in very much accessible area and her staffs are very polite and cooperative too. Dr. Chandana is my trusted Gynecologist and if anyone is looking for a good Gynecologist,  I recommend her whole heartedly.",

We got pregnant the first month of consultation itself.Dr. Chandana is very patient in explaining all the medical terms during monthly checkups.I was diagnosed with Pre-eclampsia in week 33 which is considered as high risk pregnancy and the risk is for both me and the baby. I am thankful to her for timely diagnosis and the treatment. I had planned C Section as soon as I entered 37 weeks as per her recommendation. She was very supportive during those last few weeks, she responds timely on calls and WhatsApp for any queries. Then immense medical and moral support she gave me inside Operation theater was unforgettable. Today 10 weeks postpartum, I still consult her and take her advise. Today me, my baby and my family are grateful to found her. I highly recommend her and she is the one for those who want to have their OBGs explain them the medical terms, have their worries cleared instead of simply writing prescriptions..Lastly Satyasree clinic is well maintained clinic with good response from staff for appointments and followups. Good support with diagnostic center. ",

We consulted Doctor Chandana and in the first visit, we had our fears, doubts addressed so very well that we got hope back, no false assumptions given. This helped us to accept and plan ahead. I conceived and we were happy but still had those fears around. Doctor has ensured that all the concerns are addressed at any point of time in day, helped us understand the phase and be positive through out. Her passion, compassion, knowledge, understanding nature helps the person in pain to forgo, and plan ahead. We were blessed with a healthy baby girl on 18th Feb'23. Can't thank enough God and Doctor Chandana for being there with us through out the phase. ",

She always took time to explain everything to us and encouraged us to ask questions. I wanted a normal delivery from the start and she guided us every step of the way. Even when I didn't get labor pains on my own and we were worried   she was a calming influence. In the end i did end up having a normal delivery, both me and my baby are healthy. A big heartfelt thanks to Dr Chandana from our family. ",

I gave up on hospitals then started my own research  but no use. in 2022 Dec I was weak, I couldn't  dp my daily activities  too.  they in practo I searched and read stories about this doctor. she is cool. she listened  everything.  I was so skeptical to take medicine initially.  she explained each problem she motivated to reduce weight.  the medicine she gave worked like a miracle.  hardly 2 months i have taken medicine. It  is been an year that I am free from that problem. with good diet and exercise I am happily leading my life. thank you so much mam ",
