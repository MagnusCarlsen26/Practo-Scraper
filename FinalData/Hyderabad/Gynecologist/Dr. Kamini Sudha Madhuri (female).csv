I have visited this doctor in the last trimester (9th month)of my pregnancy and we were very much worried that we have changed our doctor and came to a new person in the peak time but all those worries went into vain after meeting you. With all your friendly, soothing & positive words I became very much confident that I'm in safer hands. She maintains all the patient records very nicely & updates the record after every visit to her. She spends ample time towards patients and listens all our queries and addresses them in a polite way. She is always approachable at any time over calls or messages to address our concerns. She treats with utmost care and prescribes only minimal medicines and encourages for only normal delivery. She was more friendly to me, and I was very comfortable with her and she explained about the delivery process many times very patiently as I was afraid of having normal delivery. She removed all the fears and provided much support during my labour. But at the end, due to some issues I have opted for C section and she even motivated me after chosing c sec. But finally I have delivered a Beautiful Baby Girl under her supervision and post pregnancy follow up is also awesome. We were extremely happy and fully satisfied with your treatment & we made a good decision by choosing you in my pregnancy journey. Will never forget ur care towards me and ur smiling face and words u said after delivering my baby. Finally I would extend my sincere gratitude to you and it was my pleasure to meet such a wonderful person like u. From bottom of my heart i would thank you for making my journey smoother & successful. I would highly recommend this doctor. Hope you make many smiles alike us to all the patients with your treatment!! Wishing you all the best :) ",2021-04-01 19:10:36,False,True,Surekha,,,
