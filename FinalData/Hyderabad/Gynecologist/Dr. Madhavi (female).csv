Being pregnant during the pandemic was quite stressful, however all my visits with her have been quite smooth and safe , she was also available online whenever required which helped me with my anxiety 

I felt more relaxed during my visits as Her knowledge and experience was evident from the way she treated .her tips and advices helped a lot  to alleviate any  discomforts I had faced with minimal medication

And most of all she was there by my side in the middle of the night for delivery giving me strength and support
