She made us understand the situation and the severity with much calmness and as suggested by her, we went on to have a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Surgery went smooth.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr Deepthi Raidu ma\u2019am for any Gynec related issues. Their expertise in the field and the patience with which they deal with the patients is remarkable.",

She was extremely supportive through out the journey. She comforted us in every possible way, whenever we care out of the visit, we were always in a laugh zone.\n\nShe counselled me a lot in every visit and prepared my mind . She tried her best though I gave up multiple times. At the end she safely delivered our bundle of joy and took great care of us. I would highly appreciate and recommend to every expecting mother to consider her as their gynaecologist.\nReally Thankful.\n",
