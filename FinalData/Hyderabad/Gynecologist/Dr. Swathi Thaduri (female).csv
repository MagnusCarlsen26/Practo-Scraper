"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Abortion / Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP),",0,0,YES,"Hi, We are staying in Bangalore. In my wife's 9th week pregnancy we went for a viability scan in the Bangalore as suggested by well renowned Dr. Radhika. But unfortunately for our baby in 9th week scan, we didn't found fetal heart rate/ heartbeat. But the doctor didn't give any clue that something is wrong. But asked for a repeat scan after 15 days that is almost 11-12 weeks of pregnancy.
But as my wife's health was degrading day by day, and we have heard good about Dr. Swathi when we were in Hyderabad, we thought to go for a second opinion and booked online consultation.
She patiently took time to understand the case and realised us that we were already late in terminating the baby. As generally we do get Fetal heart rate of the baby in 6-7 weeks itself. Have no idea what Dr. Radhika was expecting and asked to wait till 11 weeks, but by god's grace we opted for second opinion under Dr. Swathi's guidance and we went for another scan and confirmed it's a missed abortion and had a surgery to remove that baby with in few days of the consultation. And beleive it or not she followed up very well that with in a week complete abortion process of D&C was done and she is completely cured now.
And Dr. Swathi gives enough time to clarify our doubts and she is never in a hurry like most other doctors do.
Thanks Dr. Swathi a lot for helping my wife become physically good with in a short duration and also counsel mentally that this is normal and nothing to worry.",2024-07-29 17:09:48,False,True,Anusha,,,
