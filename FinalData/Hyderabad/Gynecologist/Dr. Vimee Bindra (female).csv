"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Laparoscopic Surgery (Obs & Gyn),",0,0,YES,"About Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu

I came to know about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu after doing an online search regarding the best Laproscopic surgeons in Hyderabad. After reading several experiences that her pateints have shared on various online forums, I was more optimistic about my problem being resolved in the best possible way. When I first met her on 23rd Jan 2021 in her clinic, I was little nervous about how to get started with sharing my previous health issues. The way Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu received me and made me comfortable and gave me time to settle down, I felt it to be very good. She was very kind and patient to listen to my entire story and gave me the confidence that everything's gonna be alright. She has a very striking personality and has a positive energy all around her, I personally felt like sometimes its the way you are made to feel by doctors matters the most while going for a medical procedure. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu suggested me to undergo a pelvis scan test which I got it done as per her suggestion at Dr. Madhavi Scan Center. I had several follow up sessions with her and I always made sure that I ask her the questions and clear the thoughts in my mind and Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu was very polite in answering them all. I was diagnosed with a 5 cm fibroid (which I already knew) after the pelvis scan report was out and I wanted to get that removed by Laproscopic surgery. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu explained me the risks related to the surgery very clearly and assured me not to be too scared about it and prepared me to be ready mentally. She was not hesitant about sharing any relevant information and at the same time never looked to hurry the proceedings. She advised me to get the medical tests done wich were relevant going for the laproscopic surgery. She also prepped me with the required things to be done and carried leading to the surgery. Finally I had my laproscopic surgery done by Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu and her team as planned on 20th Feb 2021 in Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills and the entire experience was very good and smooth. I was able to stand up, walk, get discharged and go home the very next day i.e. 21st Feb 2021. I met the doctor again after a week post the surgery as advised and felt satisfied with the treatment received. 

The best thing I liked about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu is her humblessness and down to earth attitude. She connects with her pateints in a very friendly nature and not like typical old school doctors (no offence here) and she doesn't get offended to answer our layman/silly questions and has good sense of humour in her answers. Indeed, I feel good and take pride that we have a doctor like Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu in our society and country and we need more doctors as such. I would definitely reccommend Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu to all the ladies who have or undergoing women's related health issues. GOD bless her with best of  health, peace  and life full of bliss.",2021-05-11 11:09:34,False,True,G Srinivas Rao,,,

Doctors in this period of time lost the aim of being into this profession and known to create a good scary script for their patients. They are now treating patients as a customer to make good money. I must say to all such doctors to fear the one who created all of us.

We would like to request 'Dr. Vimee Bindra' to kindly conduct some sessions to the upcoming/junior doctors and make them aware about the value of this profession. This is not just a profession to make money, it must be to serve someone who is in pain :)

We're glad and proud that we have doctors like Vimee in our society!

There is no question of recommending her, she is the BEST among all. I'll not leave thanking the one who referred us to you and that's our close friend 'Bushra'

It was my destiny which took me to Dr Vimee Bindra just after I had received my Pregnancy positive report and rest has become an awesome journey. She gives plenty of confidence through out the period and you never realize that you are undergoing your first pregnancy. Whenever I had even a small panic, she just kicked it out. She is always confident on what steps that she is going to take. 
The day I was admitted to deliver my baby, they started to induce pain from evening and she was available through out night to check any report and give instructions to her fellow juniors. She met me next morning at pre-operative area and her smile reduced my anxiety. Every minute at operation theater was memorable as well. I would always cherish all these memories and it would be so special since it was my first pregnancy and luckily that too with Dr Vimee Bindra.
Every single moment that I reached her, I found her positive response and that always helped me to stay calm and positive. I was able to complete my full 10 months and it had been a memorable journey with Dr Vimee Bindra. I wish her every success.

DR Vimee Bindra is the best gynecologist I have ever come  across. I feel truly blessed to have found her,when I needed her help the most.Mine was a complicated case  of  multiple uterine fribriods and polyp which my family gynecologist had ignored at early stages.Doctor Vimee in my 1st consultation heard my issues with patience  and compassion and explained my diagnosis. Doctor removed the polyp which was troubling me for months,and other doctors had ignored it ,although it was an out patient procedure and I dint even feel pain like a prick. It's when I rested all my worries and knew that i was in safest  hands.
After further investigations Dr vimee explained that I will have to undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy.she clearly also mentioned i might have a chance of open surgery because of the huge fibroid size but always assured me that she will try her best to avoid it.
On 20th Jan 2021 I underwent my surgery which was estimated to last  5 - 6 hours but was successfully completed within 3.5 hours under general anesthesia. I could feel a difference when I woke up in recovery room. Its been 5 days  since my surgery and I am healing better by the day .

She explained the issue and suggested for a small surgery and she gave me lot of confidence that its very simple and easy. After the surgery I completely relived from the pain which I have been suffering since years. I will never forget her in my life as she gave my happy and painless life back. Your awesome Mam..:-)

Excellent doctor , very knowledgeable , professional and caring. I strongly recommend her to all woman and I will refer her in my office , family and friends. I hope you will reach extreme heights in your profession and you will be always in your patients hearts because of your wonderful treatment.  
Once again thank you so much for all your service and treatment. Wish you all the best and god bless you.

Empathetic, full of zeal & confidence, smiling perhaps words will fall short of if I start describing her. She is such a positive person that I had the problem of spotting in my 1st trimester and had almost decided to leave my job and go back home. But it was Dr Bindra who explained me things rationally and encouraged me to have faith. Now I am in my 6th month with everything perfectly fine just because of her.
 
She is full of energy and such a positive person and meticulous about details. Have never ever been apprehensive about asking silly questions @ silly hours to her and she has logical answers to all my questions. I belong from a family of doctors and had initially decided will go for delivery to my home town but such is the charisma of Dr Bindra that finally I HAVE DECIDED TO GET MY BABY DELIVERED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF DR BINDRA.

 All that I have to say is that I am blessed to be under her guidance.

She was extremely professional in the way she carried herself and at the same time very good natured. We had a couple of hiccups in our pregnancy, but Doctor Vimee guided us through the tough times. She never minced her words when we asked her about our problem and never kept us in the dark. She always kept her appointments and met us with a warm smile and greeting every time. I ended up having a C-section and to my surprise it was not as scary as my family and friends had told me. She was cheerful throughout the procedure and helped me with the recovery. My follow ups went very smooth too and both the doctor and us were very much satisfied with my healing. I now feel as healthy as always and happy with our healthy son. I would definitely recommend expecting parents to go to Doctor Vimee Bindra for a wonderful experience.
