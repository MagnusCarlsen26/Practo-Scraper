,,0,0,YES,"Very polite and disciplined we never seen she will reach exact on time once she gives a word. If patient comes with any serious issue she will explain the things in easy way so that they won't panic and personally she will check until her next week by calling and making them comfortable in all aspects. And coming to treatment wise we no need to tell anything she will give  100% result as expected. Overall we are happy to visit i strongly recommend to anyone without any hesitation.
