"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Female Infertility Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Hello everyone!! I definitely recommend Dr Sunitha even though my treatment was not successful. After going to 3 different doctors in my city and taking their opinions, I found Dr. Sunitha. My situation honestly was too far gone. Her opinion was not different from that of the other doctors that I saw. And I was not even hoping for a miracle, too. Medically, she gave me the same opinion and suggested a treatment with complete honesty and transparency. Told me about each and every experimental treatment out there as well. Explained the risk of those experimental procedures(other doctors didn't discuss the risk) but never pushed or forced me to go for it. She is super polite and kind towards her patients. Answered the silliest queries, too. I was stunned to find a doctor who is so famous and capable and has a high success rate, giving ample time to patients. During infertility treatment, a person goes through so much mentally, but she has the right amount of friendliness and professionalism. * ** ** ***** ******* **** ** ******* ** ********** *** **** ****** **** ****** ** ** ** ***** ** ** *** ************ *********** *** *** ***** *** ***** I still have the option to go for another procedure, and if I ever decide on that, I am definitely going back to her.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Visited Surya Fertility  to understand our problem related to no pregnancy even after years of marriage. 

 Visited Dr Alekhya in the first visit and taken all tests for me and my spouse. Then we were directed to Dr Sunitha. Both Drs and the staff are friendly and polite and have been very supportive.

Drs have started with minimal invasive methods to understand problem specific to us. And with in 2 months, my spouse conceived.
