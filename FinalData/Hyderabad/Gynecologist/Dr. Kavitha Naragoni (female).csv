None,None,0,0,YES,"I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care and expertise Dr Kavitha Naragoni Madam from Continental Hospitals (Gachibowli) has provided throughout my mom’s treatment and recent surgery. 

Kavitha Madam the way she receives the patients with positive smile and her mastery of genealogical medicine truly makes a difference with other Doctors in this competitive world.

From the moment I first consulted with Kavitha Madam, I knew I was in capable hands. Dr Kavitha Madam thorough evaluation and understanding of family history allowed for a comprehensive approach to healthcare, and I am immensely grateful for her attention to detail.

The successful outcome of the surgery is a testament to Dr Kavitha Madam skill and commitment to excellence. Dr Kavitha Madam guidance and support throughout the entire process alleviated any apprehensions I had, and I felt reassured knowing I was I safe hands.

As we know, time is very precious and most of them do not have a patience/willingness to listen to the patient’s concerns but she answers the questions with patience and clarity that truly set a benchmark, what a doctor needs and patients expect from any doctor.

I feel very fortunate that we still have such an amazing doctor in the healthcare system. Kavitha Madam, you are the best doctor I have ever met from the genealogical dept. 

Wishing you Kavitha Madam a continued success in your practice and endeavors.

This is my genuine Feedback and Thank you.

Despite her busy schedules she use to quickly respond to our queries at any time which is so good about her.
She use to clearly explain us treatment options while clarifying all our doubts so patiently.
She took at most care of my wife during her delivery and post operation.
We noticed during our stay in hospital that, she trained her team also so well to handle people better.
I highly recommend her for her competency on subject, her rich experience, her time and her special care on patients.",2021-02-25 13:12:46,False,True,Srinivas Namile,,,
None,"Heavy Bleeding,",0,0,NO,"Hi, 
I rushed to this hospital on 22/11/2015 as an emergency case. Response of the emergency ward staff was minimal. Doctor arrived, not even bothered about my pain and sense my emergency. She told me that it might be a miss carriage and asked my husband and me to decide whether we want go for surgery or a natural clean. When asked more about surgery she was not ready to explain and asked us to hurry up and take the decision. she was so careless which made us take second opinion about the Hospital and we rushed to Fernandez , where scanning was done immediately and told that my baby was still alive.

Now you guys decide how to rate her and this so called hospital on their commercial advice given to the patients.

We were also told that taking patient at this time is of high risk but i was safe until i reach Fernandez

Eventually my miss carriage happened next day but not when i was at KIMS. They could have killed by their treatment if we would have continued there.


Thank You.
