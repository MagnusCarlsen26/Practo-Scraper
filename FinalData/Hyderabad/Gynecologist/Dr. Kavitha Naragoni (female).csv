,,0,0,YES,"I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care and expertise Dr Kavitha Naragoni Madam from Continental Hospitals (Gachibowli) has provided throughout my mom’s treatment and recent surgery. 

Kavitha Madam the way she receives the patients with positive smile and her mastery of genealogical medicine truly makes a difference with other Doctors in this competitive world.

From the moment I first consulted with Kavitha Madam, I knew I was in capable hands. Dr Kavitha Madam thorough evaluation and understanding of family history allowed for a comprehensive approach to healthcare, and I am immensely grateful for her attention to detail.

The successful outcome of the surgery is a testament to Dr Kavitha Madam skill and commitment to excellence. Dr Kavitha Madam guidance and support throughout the entire process alleviated any apprehensions I had, and I felt reassured knowing I was I safe hands.

As we know, time is very precious and most of them do not have a patience/willingness to listen to the patient’s concerns but she answers the questions with patience and clarity that truly set a benchmark, what a doctor needs and patients expect from any doctor.

I feel very fortunate that we still have such an amazing doctor in the healthcare system. Kavitha Madam, you are the best doctor I have ever met from the genealogical dept. 

Wishing you Kavitha Madam a continued success in your practice and endeavors.

This is my genuine Feedback and Thank you.
