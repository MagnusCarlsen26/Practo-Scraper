None,None,0,0,Yes,I have only gone there for an ultrasound scan. She is a good doctor. The consultation was actually an impressive one but the only problem was that I had to wait for 3 hours to consult the doctor because the queue was quite long. I will recommend the doctor but the schedule has to be taken care of in a well-organized manner.,2019-12-19 12:25:24,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
