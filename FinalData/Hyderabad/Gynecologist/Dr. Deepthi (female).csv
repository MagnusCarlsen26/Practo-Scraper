"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Ovarian Cysts,",0,0,YES,"When wife got the stomach pain ..we went to citizen hospital and they asked us to do scanning and noticed 7 cm ovarian cyst left sideðŸ˜‘ they asked us do MRI and they said it might be cancerous and suggested to go for laparoscopy surgery immediately we were literally shocked and panicked .
Later we went for second opinion In Anvitha nursing home and doctor prescribed few blood tests which confirms whether it is cancerous or not and Dr Suresh has done scan in this hospital and confirms that 99% that is not cancerous ,nothing to worry but since the size of cyst is big better to take laparoscopy surgery and we don't have any knowledge about this and Dr Suresh referred our case  to very good reupdated most experienced laparoscopy surgeon .

Now my wife after surgery she  is healthy and happy

I will be 100% recommend this hospital for all gynic related problem because they have not panicked us and not forced us to go for surgery immediately like Citizen hospital staff and here they explained in detail and spend time by explaining the problem.

Hospital is very clean and hygienic.
