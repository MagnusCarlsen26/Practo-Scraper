"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"On 2nd may 2019 our first baby boy was delivered at our very own Zoi hospital somajiguda. I fall short of words to describe our entire experience with Zoi. We were seeing doctor swarna from the very beginning. Her superlative degree of experience and knowledge has helped us to imbibe the qualities that are generally required to be a parent. The amount of experience that she brings on the table is simply immense and vast. The complete delivery process was carried out very seamlessly and absolutely with no hassle. From every corner of the hospital I was guided things step by step. The articulating capacity of each individual associated with our pregnancy is outstanding. Thankyou would be a too small word for me to dust off the experience of us with Zoi. The one hospital I have seen where the doctor says c section will not be done since the path is fully functioning and favorable for a natural or normal delivery. Hats off to our lady in shining armour Dr swarna who led this really well and gave all of us a sigh of relief. 

My gratitude and appreciation will also remain for Mr venkat who handled my insurance process to be complete without any intervention of mine post signing the set of insurance documents. Mr venkat ensured that he managed the entire process so well that I had zero involvement. The support and level of knowledge Mr Venkat has is worth commendable !!!!  Lastly I would like to conclude saying that we have a very special relationship that has built over a period of time with zoi. A beautiful relationship which is filled with care,love,trust,dedication and commitment.

It is imperative for us to stand out and deliver superior results which Zoi has proved in my case and I am sure in other cases as well. Good luck and all the best Zoi hospital Somajiguda !! Way to go and many more to come.
