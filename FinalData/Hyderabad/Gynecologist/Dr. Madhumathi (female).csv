None,"PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"A TRUSTWORTHY DOCTOR
I have been Dr. Madhumathi's patient since 2016 for pcod. She is very attentive and caring towards her patients health conditions. When I got to know that am pregnant, my go to person was Dr.Madhumathi.
Though I was been in other state until my second trimester, she was always a call away to advice and guide me. Her investigations are deeper and makes sure her patient is perfectly alright. In a word, journey with such doctor is stress free and happy. 
I strongly recommend Dr madhumathi for any of your gynic problems and obstetrics",2022-02-18 20:08:16,False,True,Franky Grace,,,
