So Dr. Padma referred me to endocrinologist and kept in touch with her regularly. \n\nOnce my sugar levels were normal, I got all my tests done and started with IUI procedure and I conceived in first IUI. Then later I was referred to good Gynaecologist who delivered my baby safe and healthy. We cannot thank doctor Padma enough for taking special care throughout our journey.",

In fact, she always went miles beyond the call of her duty. We felt comfortable, positive and more hopeful. She was always just a phone call away. Pulled us up during the lows and kept us grounded during the highs. \n\nThe treatment and thereafter, it is a journey. A very important journey for expectant parents. She was there in every step of that journey with us. \n\nAs we celebrate our son's first birthday this week, we are ever thankful and indebted for the amazing part she played in the most important phase of our lives.",

She is extremely polite, soft-spoken and treats her patients like her own child.Mam always keep an eye on each and everything and guide accordingly.\n\nMam has such a pleasant smile and soft spoken nature that once u meet her u will start feeling positive and complications will go on its own. At clinic everything is systematic and well managed. Mam will never hurry you u can ask as many questions u have in ur mind. U can only leave once u r completely satisfied and want to go out on ur own.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied and happy with kind of treatment and care we got from everyone at Oasis We highly recommend Dr. Padma for IVF.
