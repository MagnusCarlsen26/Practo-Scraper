None,"Urinary Incontinence (Ui) Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My wife was having urinary inconsistency. The urge for urination was more. Initially, in Kolhapur, it was diagnosed as urinary tract infection. And she was dumped with heavy antibiotics. Though it as subsided, it continued after some gamp. When we visited, Dr.Lalitha mam, it was detected that in fact it is not Urinary tract infection it is slippery of uterus. Thank you Mam for rightly diagnosing. We thought that surgery may be needed. She assured that no surgery is needed. Only with the help of medication, she had cured and now my wife is healthy and got rid of the problem. Big thanks to Dr. Lalitha mam. In fact, not only my wife, the entire family is grateful to you mam.
