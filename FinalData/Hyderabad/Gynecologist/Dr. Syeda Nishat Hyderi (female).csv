"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Went to this hospital today and preferred Dr. Syeda Nishat Hyderi for consultation because we know her family and the hospital management which is very well educated and almost every one of the family member are well qualified but we faced very awful experience over there.
1- After the billing no guidelines was provided, the biller Ms. Vijaya asked us to wait at the waiting area but after waiting for almost 15-20 mins I checked with one of the nurse than she told us that first we have to go at nurse station for weight and BP check than our file will be forwarded to doctors cabin. So, we wasted our 20mins because of no guidance provided to us.
2 - There is no cleanliness in the hospital no sweeping or mopping was done it was very untidy.
3 - The allotted nurse took all the details of my wife which is 7 months of pregnant and was very shocked and was looking continuously at my wife’s stomach because I think it was very uncommon for her to have a patient whose stomach is not so big. Later on we noticed that the same nurse was pointing at my wife to other nurses and all were giggling and making fun of her stomach.
4 - Even after ignoring everything we waited for our turn and we were called by the doctor but again we were very shocked I (Husband of the patient) was not allowed to come inside with my wife. I told the nurse that even I have to talk with the doctor and bring in her knowledge about my wife’s previous medical history because she had went with surgeries but the nurse stopped me and told that I can’t come inside the consultation room along with my wife. Seriously !!!
What’s wrong with you people ?
No hospital does this. Husbands are of course allowed in every hospital during consultation and scanning. Is this the way you people run your hospital ? Is this right to you ?
We were consulting with Fernandez Hospital but we decided to go ahead with Majestic Hospital for delivery after having discussions with my family and friends. Sorry to say but the management of the hospital sucksss. Everything is acceptable but nurses themselves are making fun of the patients is not at all accepted.",2022-11-10 09:35:51,False,True,Syed Shabbir Hussain,,,
