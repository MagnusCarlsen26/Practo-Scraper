We had two unsuccessful conceiving during last two years (when we consulted different doctors), but our confidence got boosted multi fold right from our first check up with Dr.SriDevi.\nShe never prescribed unnecessary medications or unnecessary tests. And Dr used to explain the importance of each medicine and test prescribed.\nShe always spent good amount of time with us, cleared all our doubts and misconceptions, taught us the right things. (This is something we were lacking during our past two bitter experiences with different doctors).  This developed a special bond for us with the doctor, She is like our family member now.\nDoctor and Staff were always available at anytime. We had few \u201cfalse alarms\u201d during and after 36 weeks of pregnancy, and had to rush to hospital on a Sunday, and few times in late hours. \nKudos to Staff, they were super responsive on the phone call and readily available in the hospital, take LST tests and send them to doctor and guidance of doctor at those critical times were really a boon to us.\nThanks to Dr.SriDevi and Team (Anusha, Sandhya, Sireesha, Amani, Leela, Radha, Kamala, Aayamma, Hope I ve not missed any name here :) ) for all your support.\nNow we have our baby, and We will miss all of you, seems like a last of college when we bid farewell to all our good friends and teachers :)\nAll the best to all the staff, Wish a lot more success to Dr.SriDevi",

Dr. Ragi took detailed note of my past history and took all measures to protect my pregnancy by all means. My overall pregnancy journey has been smooth. However, whenever I faced any trouble with regard to acute acidity or constipation, doctor came to my rescue. She was  reachable  via phone. I rarely came across a doctor who herself checks on patient to know her status update. I remember on days when I visited her in the morning in acute trouble, she would check my status at night. I am extremely blessed  to have Dr. Ragi as my consultant in this pregnancy journey. Though my pregnancy journey has been overall smooth, surprisingly my water broke at 4am on 35th week. My husband called Sai Neha hospital at that odd hour 4am to inform emergency. Within 5 mins, Dr. Ragi called back and has been all throughout over phone and guided me till I took admission. She was constantly there and ensured that I have safe delivery. I am extremely grateful to her the way she dealt the emergency situation and ensured my and my baby's safety. I strongly recommend her for consultation. I have earlier visited many gynaecologists who would charge Rs. 700/- for consultation but wouldn't even spare 7 minutes for you. Dr. Sridevi Ragi is a true professional. She patiently listens to you and thoroughly checks you and explains in details to you everything. Most importantly, she gives you time.  She is very approachable, sincere and responsible doctor. She has the required expertise to deal with emergency situation. I cannot thank her enough for being always there in my pregnancy journey! Thank you Doctor! I am forever grateful to you! \ud83d\ude4f",

Dr. Sri Devi ragi ma'am is very friendly and used to be very calm during the visit. She used to clear our doubts very neatly. She never gave any unnecessary scans and medications. Anyone can follow her instructions and suggestions blindly without thinking twice. She gave her number and said that don't hesitate to call whenever needed. I liked that as many won't give their number to patients. And most important I used to be very happy after visiting her for checkups every time by clearing all my doubts and by listening to her advice. I appreciate her patience. Even after attending so many patients she always used to be very cool and calm and always smiling which made me feel comfortable. As we were very much satisfied with her treatment we never felt to change. Pregnancy pains triggered in the Sunday evening, and we are admitted in the hospital in the late evening, Dr. Sri Devi ragi ma'am came to the hospital and she was there all night in the hospital with me, I was blessed with baby boy at 12:30 AM, and Sri Devi ragi ma'am was there till 7 AM in the hospital and came to see me for every hour.  I can highly recommend this doctor & clinic",

We had two unsuccessful conceiving during last two years (when we consulted different doctors), but our confidence got boosted multi fold right from our first check up with Dr.SriDevi.\nShe never prescribed unnecessary medications or unnecessary tests. And Dr used to explain the importance of each medicine and test prescribed.\nShe always spent good amount of time with us, cleared all our doubts and misconceptions, taught us the right things. (This is something we were lacking during our past two bitter experiences with different doctors).  This developed a special bond for us with the doctor, She is like our family member now.\nDoctor and Staff were always available at anytime. We had few \u201cfalse alarms\u201d during and after 36 weeks of pregnancy, and had to rush to hospital on a Sunday, and few times in late hours. \nKudos to Staff, they were super responsive on the phone call and readily available in the hospital, take LST tests and send them to doctor and guidance of doctor at those critical times were really a boon to us.\nThanks to Dr.SriDevi and Team (Anusha, Sandhya, Sireesha, Amani, Leela, Radha, Kamala, Aayamma, Hope I ve not missed any name here :) ) for all your support.\nNow we have our baby, and We will miss all of you, seems like a last of college when we bid farewell to all our good friends and teachers :)\nAll the best to all the staff, Wish a lot more success to Dr.SriDevi",

Dr. Ragi took detailed note of my past history and took all measures to protect my pregnancy by all means. My overall pregnancy journey has been smooth. However, whenever I faced any trouble with regard to acute acidity or constipation, doctor came to my rescue. She was  reachable  via phone. I rarely came across a doctor who herself checks on patient to know her status update. I remember on days when I visited her in the morning in acute trouble, she would check my status at night. I am extremely blessed  to have Dr. Ragi as my consultant in this pregnancy journey. Though my pregnancy journey has been overall smooth, surprisingly my water broke at 4am on 35th week. My husband called Sai Neha hospital at that odd hour 4am to inform emergency. Within 5 mins, Dr. Ragi called back and has been all throughout over phone and guided me till I took admission. She was constantly there and ensured that I have safe delivery. I am extremely grateful to her the way she dealt the emergency situation and ensured my and my baby's safety. I strongly recommend her for consultation. I have earlier visited many gynaecologists who would charge Rs. 700/- for consultation but wouldn't even spare 7 minutes for you. Dr. Sridevi Ragi is a true professional. She patiently listens to you and thoroughly checks you and explains in details to you everything. Most importantly, she gives you time.  She is very approachable, sincere and responsible doctor. She has the required expertise to deal with emergency situation. I cannot thank her enough for being always there in my pregnancy journey! Thank you Doctor! I am forever grateful to you! \ud83d\ude4f",

Dr. Sri Devi ragi ma'am is very friendly and used to be very calm during the visit. She used to clear our doubts very neatly. She never gave any unnecessary scans and medications. Anyone can follow her instructions and suggestions blindly without thinking twice. She gave her number and said that don't hesitate to call whenever needed. I liked that as many won't give their number to patients. And most important I used to be very happy after visiting her for checkups every time by clearing all my doubts and by listening to her advice. I appreciate her patience. Even after attending so many patients she always used to be very cool and calm and always smiling which made me feel comfortable. As we were very much satisfied with her treatment we never felt to change. Pregnancy pains triggered in the Sunday evening, and we are admitted in the hospital in the late evening, Dr. Sri Devi ragi ma'am came to the hospital and she was there all night in the hospital with me, I was blessed with baby boy at 12:30 AM, and Sri Devi ragi ma'am was there till 7 AM in the hospital and came to see me for every hour.  I can highly recommend this doctor & clinic",

Mam was very friendly and she listens to all our problem and explains very neatly, after that I was worried why I could not find her during my initial days of pregnancy and the way she has taken care during section was impressive and awesome. She will respond immediately  during emergency and also she answers our small doubts durring the pregnancy through mobile.\n \nOver all great experience with Sridevi mam..the only concern is we have to go for reimbursement there is no cashless services if we go for insurance.",

She encourages one to have normal delivery unless there is any other medical condition or other factors. I had an emergency C-section and delivered a healthy baby boy. Hospital staff were available round the clock for any support needed. Even after discharge mam and hospital staff were very supportive when we reached out to them on phone for any queries. Highly recommend Dr.Sridevi Ragi mam. Can't thank Mam and her staff enough for all their support throughout.",

Because of that in my 2nd also i didn't opt it. What i liked most is mam's patience.

When I say the doctor made me feel that I was in safe hands and even made my wife/me smile when we left, then you can believe She is the best. I am truly grateful to Dr. Sridevi Ragi since she rescued us on the 7th month of pregnancy after the unfortunate death of Dr. Satya Ramya.Big corporates usually scare me with all thehype which goes around there. In this case I still remember our first visit where I just took an online appointment & I was sent in within 5minutes of my arrival at the clinic. She took a detailed history & patiently looked at my wife's previous health records. She gave very genuine advice with minimal investigations & to followup with them. She was very precise in what signs we had to watchout for when my wife was on treatment. I came out with a deep sense of satisfaction & relief that we found the right place. I have always been able to talk to the doctor and get my problems resolved 24\u00d77. Coming here is like dealing with trusted family. Would not consider changing doctors",

She is very calm and listens problems with patience . I had a smooth journey throughout pregnancy but at last moment some complications came which she handled very well . She is just like a god for us. She makes patient comfortable which we need most from a doctor. Dr. Sridevi Ragi is blindly trustable doctor anyone can go for her without any second thought.",
