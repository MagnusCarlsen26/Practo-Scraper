She had complications of respiratory distress, but Dr. T. Shashidhar and the NICU staff acted and cared for her very swiftly and made sure she got the best possible care. Dr. Shashidhar's availability and periodic updates offered reassurance during tense times.\n \nLabour pains, delivery admissions and post-delivery Care:\nI would like to thank the support staff of Green Med Hospital, especially Shri Imran, who was available always to help us. Also, the entire staff from on call DMO, nurses and other supporting staff because of whom the entire journey went smoothly. They treated my wife and baby like family. The rooms were always clean, and the hygiene was maintained regularly.\n \nPrenatal Yoga:\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Asha, who conducted weekly prenatal yoga classes. It was immensely helpful to my wife benefitted to manage her pregnancy well.\n \nOverall Experience:\nDo visit Green Med Hospital for pregnancy and pediatric care.

She was through about our concerns and explained everything in detail. She did not prescribe too much of medications both before and during pregnancy. As it neared the final month of pregnancy, certain complications were observed for which detailed explanation was given by Dr. Reddy.\n \nLabor and Delivery:\nOn April 18, 2024, our baby girl was born. She had complications of respiratory distress, but Dr. T. Shashidhar and the NICU staff acted and cared for her very swiftly and made sure she got the best possible care. Dr. Shashidhar's availability and periodic updates offered reassurance during tense times.\n \nLabour pains, delivery admissions and post-delivery Care:\nI would like to thank the support staff of Green Med Hospital, especially Shri Imran, who was available always to help us. Also, the entire staff from on call DMO, nurses and other supporting staff because of whom the entire journey went smoothly. They treated my wife and baby like family. The rooms were always clean, and the hygiene was maintained regularly.\n \nPrenatal Yoga:\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Asha, who conducted weekly prenatal yoga classes. It was immensely helpful to my wife benefitted to manage her pregnancy well.\n \nOverall Experience:\nDo visit Green Med Hospital for pregnancy and pediatric care. Finally, a big thanks to Dr. Keertana Reddy and Dr. T Shashidhar for giving us our bundle of joy. The arrival of our daughter has made the world feel smaller. Thank you.",

Dr. Keerthana is the only doctor who was prompt in diagnosis of my case with a well defined treatment plan.

But when I consulted Dr.Keerthana, she explained the issue and readly took up my case with no hesitation. Not wasting any time in unnecessary investigations, she started the treatment and the results prove her perfection. I conceived within few months and now waiting for my little miracle to arrive. I am continuing my journey with her treatment. I undoubtedly recommend Dr. Keerthana for any gynaecology related issues. ",
