Due to more people prefer her as the best doctor and wait for her, sometimes we will have to wait for more than 1 hr but most of the time we had to wait for more than 30min. Once my daughter got flu and she treated her like normal patient. while other people were wearing all the safety cloths, she used to come to my daughter's room normally with just a mask and spent plenty of time by playing with her. She even did not care about other's who were told about safety and replied: ""She is kid and she has to recover with care"". Thank you for all the care",2019-09-04 10:48:02,False,True,Kranthi,,,

She has 0 patience, she couldn’t listen to the baby’s problem.

Why would anyone want to see her without any reason and we who have paid 500-600 for 1 min of her time had all the rights to visit till we have validity. 

Worst part is she didn’t even touch my baby girl who was 7months old suffering from stomach ache and diarrhoea but prescribed 7 varieties of tests ( blood., motion, urine test etc).
