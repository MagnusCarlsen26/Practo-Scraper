"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,"My new born daughter has been under Dr. Laxmi's care since her first week.
This doctor actually listens to the complaints and makes a real effort to pinpoint the root cause of the problem based on the feedback (which is quite rare these days with other super busy doctors, who rely more on lab reports).
She thoroughly explains the causes of disease/discomfort and advises the best remedies, without prescribing unnecessary medications / diagnostic tests.
The doctor is friendly, service oriented and accessible during all working days.
The hospital itself is very well maintained and hygienic.
Consultation procedure is hassle free.
I highly recommend Dr Laxmi for all pediatric consultations. ",2019-07-08 09:42:26,False,True,ujwal,,,

We had been under her supervision since the birth of my baby. It is due to her care and diligence that a fatal infection of my baby was diagnosed at the earliest stage. I am indebted to her for that support that actually saved my child.  Since then for every complication of my baby I visit this doctor. 

She is a very caring doctor **** ******** ********** She gives a lot of time to the parents to make them understand the causes of the illness his/her baby is suffering from and never suggests anything unnecessary. 

In a word she is what a pediatrician should be. I highly recommend this doctor.
