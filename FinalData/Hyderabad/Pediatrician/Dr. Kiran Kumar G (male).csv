I am extremely grateful to Dr. Kiran Kumar for the exceptional care he provided to my daughter, Noorain, during her recent illness. Noorain was diagnosed with dengue and was admitted to Continental Hospital under Dr. Kumar's care.

From the very beginning, Dr. Kumar exhibited remarkable professionalism and compassion. He thoroughly explained the treatment plan, addressing all our concerns with patience and clarity. His expertise and attentive care played a pivotal role in Noorain's recovery.

I highly recommend Dr. Kiran Kumar to anyone in need of expert medical care.",2024-08-07 09:39:16,False,True,Noor Haq,,,
