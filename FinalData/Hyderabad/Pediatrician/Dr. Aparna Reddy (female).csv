"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Adolescent Followup & Vaccinations,",0,0,NO,"Hi Everyone,

We consulted Dr.Aparna reddy for my 3 Yr old kid, very bad experience with the doctor, we went for consultation as our Kid had severe cough and wheezing for a week, she just checked the kid and decided that Kid has wheezing and suggested blood tests for ESR, IGE and CBP and Chest X-Ray and suggested 3 days Omnacortil forte syrup ( steroid medicine) and Levolin and Budecort Inhaler and Montair syrup.

We took the blood tests and got high IGE and ESR values and on follow up consultation she said the Kid is allergic and we have to take TB test.
She asked if kid has frequent Fevers and Vomitings, when we answered that during season changes kid gets fever she arrogantly said that it‚Äôs not how you assume you can‚Äôt decide what problem kid has and when we asked what‚Äôs the frequency of fever to understand if it‚Äôs TB case she didn‚Äôt have any answer and said I can‚Äôt give you a single line answer for this.
She finally suggested to monitor temperature regularly and continue Montair and levolin (sos) and budecort and added a multivitamin syrup.
