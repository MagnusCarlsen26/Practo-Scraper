He has wide range of experience in different issue related to kids health. By just having a glance he can make it out what exactly the reason behind kids suffering, very good diagnosis. I have referred many parents to visit once, all parents are very happy and continue going for his treatment. In one statement, I just blindly believe his treatment.  I\u2019m Aishi\u2019s mother. Now my daughter is 5 yrs. I would have given feedback quite long back but it\u2019s high time I should thank him by sharing my experiences. \nIf any other related issue comes Dr.  will refer to specialist where I got really good diagnosis and treated well and soon. There are so many examples which I came across and treated well. Thank you so much doctor.  He was the pediatrician in delivery time when Aishi born. \n\nRegards\nAishi\u2019s mom ",

So, basis my continuous experience of the past 1 year, I feel I am qualified to provide a feedback. To us, he came across as a knowledgeable person who gives complete time and effort to assess a child. The best part is that he is easy to go and in limited words, expresses what is relevant and what is not. I have a lot of faith in his findings and follow his instructions in letter and spirit. Infact, even when I was traveling out of Hyderabad, he was accessible if I needed an advise.\n\nThanks for your services that you cater to the community, Mr. Rao. Trust me, people like us feel privileged to have you as a go-to doctor for their little ones :)",
