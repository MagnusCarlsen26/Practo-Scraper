None,None,0,0,YES,We approched Dr Sharmila garu on an emergency as my daughter had severe stomach ace. The way she treated and explained the issue to us was an outstanding and complete treatment went on well. Ideally we choose to take 2nd opinion but she her self suggested and took 2nd opinion on behalf of us with known people and suggested us to undergo for surgery. Today we are happy and daughter is back to normal. Thank you so much Dr. Sharmila  garu,2021-07-21 08:31:07,False,True,Mahesh,,,

None,None,0,0,NO,"*** ******** ** ****** ******** ******* **** ********* *** ********** I had to visit Dr. Sharmila on December 12, 2022, for my 4 year old's fever and stomach pain. She even did not do the clinical examination and rather made a diagnosis on her own without listening to symptoms of chronic constipation. She wrote tests and diagnostic examinations of Rs. 5000/- without any conclusive diagnosis. Unfortunately,  my daughter was not well till evening. When I called her, she again insisted to come for an abdominal ultrasound and threatened about so many big big diseases. Finally, I had to visit another doctor *** ********** ***** **** ********** ** *** ******** ***** ** *** **** ********** Now my baby is perfectly fine.

A very unfriendly and grumpy demeanour, with no discussion or proper listening to the symptoms, no sign of concern or empathy to the concerns of the patient on top of high consultation fees-not at all recommended.Even the treatment regime was nothing that I didn't already know",2017-08-21 11:57:19,False,False,Esther,,,

We have been to this Doctor Sharmila  4 times and she could not diagnose it as Pneumonia.

We were fortunate she was not available during our 4th visit and reffered to a Senior doctor who has diagnosed our daughters problem as pneumonia.

I would not recommend Dr Sharmila.",2016-04-08 18:53:08,False,False,deepak buddineni,,,
None,None,0,0,NO,"The doctor has no respect for other’s time. We had to wait for 1.5h even after taking an appointment. She just closed the door and talked to someone. If you are busy during a certain time slot, don’t take appointments during that time. We had to wait a lot before also, but this time it was just too much. I’d never recommend the doctor to anyone",2022-02-12 09:23:27,False,False,Ranjan,,,
