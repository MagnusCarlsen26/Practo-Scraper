"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Fever,",0,0,NO,"Ofcourse the Dr. is experienced. But, not a very friendly one. He hardly gave time to the patient.
However, major concern is hospital staff. 
We visited the doc for treatment of my 13 months daughter. She had rashes all over the body with slight fever. Doc advised us to bring her back if fever increases. Next day her fever went upto 103 and we rushed her to Rohan hospital. However, the emergency doctor there was not willing to even look at the patient. She said you should come after 6. We explained her baby has high fever with chills,to which she replied many babies have that. We were really shocked on her approach. She was not ready to take the temperature nor she once looked at the baby.  Was a very unprofessional behavior and hospital staff is ready to risk a baby's health for their lethargic behavior and attitude. Highly disappointed.
We immediately left the hospital and went to a different hospital. ",2018-02-01 08:41:49,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
