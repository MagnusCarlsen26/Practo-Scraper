None,None,0,0,Yes,We had met the doctor and it was for my wife as she had allergy. *** ****** *** ***** Medicine was prescribed by the doctor. I can recommend doctor to my family or friends. I am satisfied with the treatment given. There was waiting time in the hospital for 10- 15 minutes. She told me to reduce weight and diet was suggested. Doctor told over period of time it will be reduced. Hospitality was good. Doctor was more patient and we spent 40-45 minutes with doctor.,2020-07-22 11:03:35,False,True,Kavya,,,
