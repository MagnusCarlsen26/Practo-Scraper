None,None,0,0,YES,I am overwhelmed by the overtly pleasant experience at your clinic. My Elder kid got habituated to using potty in no time thanks to your councelling.

Your warm reception of patients that is seldom seen among doctors of the day adds a great medicinal value to your therapeutics.

None,None,0,0,YES,My son was a premature baby at 1.30 kg . Unlike all other doctors Dr Sudheer asked me to not admit him in hospital instead give him very traditional therapy called kangaroo mother therapy. He told me that the risk of infection could be low at home and the baby will grow very quickly when he is with the mother; I did not expect this kind of result and my baby was 2.25 kg within 10 days and touchwood he is a very healthy and happy baby with no delayed milestones since . It is very rare to find this kind of honesty and experience in the doctors today and I am very lucky to have found such a good doctor for my son . I will highly recommend going to Dr Sudhir ** **  **** *************  *** ** very ethical . ,2021-01-23 09:09:44,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
