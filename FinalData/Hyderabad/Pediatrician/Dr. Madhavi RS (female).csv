"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Vaccination/ Immunization,",0,0,YES,"*** ** *** ** *** ****** ** *** ****** Unlike all other doctors whom we consulted for our new born baby, she was more inclined towards natural healing and emphasized more on infant's comfort. She doesn't prescribe blood tests or any other tests for that matter unnecessarily. She is experienced enough to be able to gauge baby's needs without pulling out blood. 

She is also a very friendly doctor, takes out time and explains everything in detail. She doesn't believe in frequent hospital visits especially for infants. She is one of the few doctors who is very prompt on responding to calls or WhatsApp messages. 

Overall, we are very happy that we switched to her and we recommend her - 100%!
