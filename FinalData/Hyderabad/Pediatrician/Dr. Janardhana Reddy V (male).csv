"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Cough In Children,Fever,",0,0,NO, Time is valuable especially when its come to your child health...only investigation for a week with no results is not we expect from such a responsible person like doctor. I think its only due to hospital policies.  ,2019-11-20 15:08:30,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hi, it seems to be your child got viral infection, first ur kid visited with complaints fever, rash over body, body pains as far as i remembered, examination was normal, I was suggested CBP, CRP, dengue test were normal. Again u came with   Persistent fever spikes and with increased cough and cold , on examination she had slightly decreased breath sounds on right infrascapular area and I advised chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia.It suggestive of viral picture. If I ordered investigations for money , I would have been advised admission after 1 week of fever but apparently she is active and eating well , so I advised oral medications along with antibiotic. The crux here is antibiotic will not work for viral infections and I am a human being and will not diagnose everything by examination itself and without investigations. Think twice before giving negative feedback as it is easy to do .Anyway I wish speedy recovery of your kid in the hands of responsible doctor   Thank you",2019-11-21T14:13:06+0000,Dr. Janardhana Reddy V
