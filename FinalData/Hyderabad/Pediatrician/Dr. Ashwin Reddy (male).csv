"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,NO,"We went to this doctor as my son is suffering from cold and couldn't able to sleep for 2 nights continuously. I explained the doctor carefully about the problem. He checked my son in his eyes and given some drops and asked to use them for 3 days and visit again after 3 days. he said the problem was due to Mucas buildup in chest.
After 2 doses of the drops my son started suffering a lot and couldn't sleep the same night. Also Vomited twice.
We went to another doctor whom we know for quiet a long time. After checking my son's Body temperature, Eyes, Ears, Mouth and Stomach,  to our surprise he said that the reason was that his right ear bud was swollen and this is causing severe pain in his ears. He prescribed ear drops and after using single dose my son is back to normal.
