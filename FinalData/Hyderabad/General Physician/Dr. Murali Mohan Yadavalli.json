He is  excellent at answering all our questions and thoroughly satisfied with the treatment....He is one of the most knowledgeable doctor and taken good care of my health and he is extremely kind.\nOnce when I took my friend to Dr. Murali..... she  had cough for more than a couple of months and nothing could cure..... Dr. Murali identified that she had low hemoglobin and suffering with iron deficiency and not pulmonary problem and after treatment cough subsided... \nThank you Doctor. \n\n\n.",
