None,None,0,0,NO,"I had the most undesirable and worse of experience with her . I went to her with extreme pain in my abdomen , she put on the canula and hospitalized me. But didn't tell about the charges before making the case sheet and admitting. When we got to know about the high prices of rooms per day we could not carry further and decided to discharge. But she behaved so rudley, she didn't bother about my pain and agony . She didn't let us leave and forced us to remove the canula before leaving. I was in sooo much pain yet she stood in the way and dint let us leave and we left after removal of canula .I was taken to another hospital *** ****** *** ***** * *** ** ******* ******* *** ******* ********** We were in the hospital for just half an hour *** *************  ****** *** ******* ** *** ******** That was the most disappointing  and painful experience .
