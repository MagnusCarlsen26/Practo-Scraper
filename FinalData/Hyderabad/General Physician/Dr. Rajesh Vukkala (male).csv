None,None,0,0,YES,"    I went to Dr.Rajesh for Vitamin-D prescription as I was diagnosed with Vitamin-D deficiency may be a reason for dry eyes after seeing earlier positive feedback in practo.

I felt very comfortable and at the same time he has given me so much of time (nearly half-an-hour) to explain my problem history.
