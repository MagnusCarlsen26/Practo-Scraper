"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Annual health checkup,",0,0,YES,"Firstly i recommend the lalitha devi garu. Why because patient's are very nervous to doctors. 
one day i met the lalitha devi garu. She was treated me like as my mother. And she is speaking very soothingly, she told me how to  take food and careness.
she is having proessionalismm and humanity.she is enjoying her profession.
I heared she is recently came back to india from soudhi.In soudhi so many doctors available. But in india like Lalitha Devi doctors is need for here.
Like these every doctor should treat the patient's. Then automatically half of desease will cure.
And my opinion is she is role model. 
Such a nice persion i met.In my chaild hood i thought i want to be a doctor. But unluckly my poorness not suppoted.If i am the doctor then i will behave like Lalitha Devi garu.And i wish the all the best for your future.you take care about patients, god will take care about you and your family.
