,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Dhanunjaya is best at his job of saving lives. 
We visited him at Continental Hospital along with my father who was in serious discomfort. Dr. had a prolonged examination with my dad and tried to understand all he could and finally suggested us to get the admission which seemed inevitable. After just a couple of days my dad was doing great. With clear examination and great patient care Dr became go to person for diabeties for my father, while Doctor himself being a nephrologist, treated him well that almost all my dad's reports are normal. Thanks to Dr. Dhanunjaya.",2021-10-21 10:56:01,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
