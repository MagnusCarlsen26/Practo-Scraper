Thank you for the feedback. 

We regret about the inconvenience caused. Thanks for considering me as the grace for my establishment, in spite of your disappointment with other staff. 
However now that you had found me comfortable the very purpose of your visit is fulfilled, because it is the relation between the doctor and patient that really matters.
If I find something is wrong with a patient, I will discuss it with the patient and do needful to cure him but I donot prefer to write it on any web platform. In the same way I would have been more happy if you would had brought these things to my notice directly in my chamber.  I believe that our meeting was to solve each others problems but not to judge each other.
Coming to other issues without prejudice. I had enquired and found following .

1.Our staff are allowed to wear foot wear due to health and safety reason working extended hours and also to avoid any slips or protection of feet from injection glass pieces in working areas
2 The stains you noticed on the bed sheet were nothing but the conduction jelly stains used in ENMG studies.
3 standard voltage is given in electophysiological studies, if your patient experienced any extra pain that might be due to sensitivity of an individual patient or disease of nerves.

I regret to the inconvenience caused and thanks for the feedback.

1)Few attendents who accompanied your patient insisted on occupying the patient's chairs for which our staff requested them to sit in outside chairs due to fear of the premises getting overcrowded . Nothing personal. Sorry for the inconvenience.

 The risks and experiences which health care personnel and their families are facing due to Covid are far more worse than many experiences.

Overall i felt nice for a first timer like me who is looking for better place for checkup.

But I think front desk staff can probably be more proactive and keep informing the waiting patients about possible delay to avoid impatience and avoid going and checking multiple times for their turn.

I looked  into the matter and found following :
Your scheduled appointment time was 2 :30 pmbut you visited the hospital at 3:00 pm. 
That one hour which you had mentioned   as waiting time for getting the test done was actually the test conducting time and result processing time. Any effort to cut it short will compromise the test result and defeats the primary purpose of your hospital visit. 
The time during which a doctor examines a patient is the most important time for that patient who is in front of the doctor, but it is the waste of time for patients sitting outside the the doctor's chamber. Let's rename the word ""waiting time for me"" with the word ""pain relieving time for someone "". 
Unplanned emergencies which we can't say no just because they lack prior appointment is another barrier that disturbs our schedule. 
Please remember that you are allowing us to do something very important by waiting outside, relieving the pain of the citizens of our  own country. This message is not only for you but for all my dear and beloved patients. 
Sorry for the inconvenience once again. We will make every effort to cut down your waiting time.

The important challenge is striking a balance between the waiting time of the patients outside the chamber and time spent in reassuring, educating,and prescribing inside the chamber. In spite of the sincere efforts, we end up in dissatisfaction occassionally in the counselling part. This might happen when the patient load is substantial.
My sincere request to all the patients is to ask me upfront if any thing is not clear just like a student asks his teacher.  I will be more than happy to clarify your doubts. In this way you can help me to help you. You  go to the doctor with health problems , if you go away with dissatisfaction of Incomplete explanation it neither serves you nor the treating doctor. When ever you go to the doctor please assert for a detailed explanation upfront in the chamber itself if  any thing is not clear. Anything other than this will not decrease your pain , it may cause pain of resentment. Please remember you are paying for the service . It is your right to know about your problem.
