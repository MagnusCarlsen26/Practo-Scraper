But with 1 endoscopy test, Dr. Praneeth had identified the issue and resolved the problem. He took ample time to explain the identified issue and told me the procedure to get permanent relief from Acid Reflux. He checked all the previous medical test  reports and did 1 test only to clarify the doubt. I believe AIIM S doctor are very much capable of identifying the exact cause/disease. Thank you Dr. Praneeth \ud83d\udc4d",

He took ample time to explain the identified issue and told me the procedure to get permanent relief from Acid Reflux.
