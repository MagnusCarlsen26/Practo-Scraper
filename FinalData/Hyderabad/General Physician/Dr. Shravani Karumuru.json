A patient in that critical stage takes alot of efforts and time but with help of the doctor it was pretty quick and the recovery was very fast. \nShe understands the needs and pain of the patient and accordingly she treat them with a great ease.\nIt's my personal experience that every after handling hundreds of patients, she speaks with every attendant to explain about the steps of treatment she opted for and also consults patient for his concern.  She is one of the gifted doctors and can't thank enough for her support. She never neglects to reply even after the discharge.. *** ** ***** * **** ****** * **** **** **** *********",
