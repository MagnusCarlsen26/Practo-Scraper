"Doctor friendliness,",None,0,0,YES,"I have been a regular visitor of Dr Hussain and trust his medicines. But of lately I have seen a trend in doctors of Apollo Hospital to suggest every patient a series of tests to come to a conclusion.
In past 3 months every member of my family who has visited Apollo were given the same set of tests - like Dengue, every possible blood test and so on..
Not to mention the price of almost every test lies in the rage of 1000₹ which altogether burn a hole in patient’s pocket.
To me a good doctor is someone who doesn’t suggests patients all sorts of tests in a hit and try way to come to a conclusion about a patients disease..
I know this review won’t make any change in the ongoing practice but would like the patients to be more informed and choose a doctor wisely..",2017-11-07 04:07:52,False,True,Nishanth,,,
