He gives ample time and his ears for the patient to explain his condition. He leaves no room for doubt and does root cause analysis for the condition. The way he inquires about the present medication, dosage and composition, I think the pharma companies have to sweat out a lot for getting their products approved and getting him prescribe them. He doesn't give false promises of cure but after talking to him you can see ""light"" at the end of the tunnel. He promptly suggests if any specialist is required for further diagnosis. He is open to all previous Doctors' reports without any inhibition. His approach is quite modern yet deriving roots from a traditional  ""Doc-Patient"" relationship. He doesn't go for so called ""costly"" medicines which patients ask for faster cure and is very up to date about latest available medicines. He throws light in to latest research findings which gives the hope, as HOPE is the best free medicine available. I am writing this on behalf of my father.

Sound knowledge. Spends time to understand the problem and provides various insights into how it could have originated. Takes time to explain the problem. I had quite a few interactions with him, and found him to prescribe medium-to-low medication but more on the natural methods to address the situation. He also had suggested some lifestyle changes and do's/don'ts. Very good demeanor and hospitality.

I had recommended him to my friends, colleagues and I'd continue to recommend him..!!
