"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Hair Removal,Skin Rejuvenation,Double Chin Treatment,Skin Care,Fillers,",0,0,YES,"I got treated by both Dr. Vritika and Dr. Naveen. They are a young, fun yet professional duo which made me very comfortable with them to begin with. First of all, Thanks to them and NAVA - I never have to go to the parlour again!
They are very patient and answer all my questions. I got laser previously from another clinic but the procedure time was too long so I stopped. But what I loved at NAVA, was that my face, underarms, full arms and legs all got done in a span of 30-45 mins and that was a huge relief ! and the hair growth also had drastically reduced!  
The Q switch treatment I got done helped me get a fresh look on my face! After a lot of contemplation but assurance from Dr. Naveen, I got botox done on my forehead (between eyebrows - frownlines) and it was great - People stopped asking me why I was frowning for no reason - haha ! 
Dr. Vritika gave me a skincare routine that requires very less effort and that for me is perfect with my busy schedule. The soap, Vitamin C serum and sunscreen have been making me give the right kind of love my skin needs ! 

I recommend them 100% for simple, affordable, ********* skin treatments !!

The doctors and the staff are very friendly and make you feel the most comfortable. I got face contouring, depigmentation, and IPL hair removal for my face and arms. I saw a visible reduction and slowest growth of my facial hair in just 2 sittings. 
I underwent 9 sittings of traditional laser treatment few years back elsewhere and sadly couldn't get see much reduction.
The face contouring was also very effective in toning and highlighting my facial features in few sittings. 
So I'll strongly recommend this new IPL technology at NAVA for hair removal and other treatments which is not just effective, time-saving and painless but also costs much less than the traditional laser reduction treatments other clinics offer.",2019-10-10 15:36:19,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
