If repeat consultation charges were paid by you.. it is a mistake. U can come to collect it. 

Test are done based on the history and findings to come to a diagnosis. Many times it helps for proper treatment. Without tests, if something gets worse , the patients will suffer more and it becomes a medical negligence. ( it’s sorry state of affairs in medical practise.. tests done- patient crib, tests not done and misdiagnosed- patients crib more)

Regarding blood test hygiene- I will look into
