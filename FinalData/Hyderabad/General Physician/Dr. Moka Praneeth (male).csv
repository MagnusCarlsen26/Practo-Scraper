"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Gastroesophageal reflux,GERD,",0,0,YES,"I was suffering from GERD from 10 months and couldn't get any relief after 10 doctor consultation, 50 tests, 100 medicines  from 10 different hospitals. But with 1 endoscopy test, Dr. Praneeth had identified the issue and resolved the problem. He took ample time to explain the identified issue and told me the procedure to get permanent relief from Acid Reflux. He checked all the previous medical test  reports and did 1 test only to clarify the doubt. I believe AIIM S doctor are very much capable of identifying the exact cause/disease.
