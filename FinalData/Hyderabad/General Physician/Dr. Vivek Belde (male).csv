Dr. Vivek is a doctor who treats patients with a lot of courtesy, empathy and compassion. When he’s treating me, it felt like I am his most important patient. The attention to detail that he provided in terms of my health issues is commendable. 

He makes you feel very comfortable to share and discuss the underlying health problems and I am grateful to him *** *** ********* ********* ** ******** **. 

Taking the prescribed medications has improved my condition and health so much. Thank you so much doctor!
