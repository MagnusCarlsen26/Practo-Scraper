"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Respiratory tract infection,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Sandeep was very attentive and detailed with his explanation and treatment. My entire family
Impacted with covid and he did treat the family with utmost care and kind enough to guide me with proper medication even post hospitalisation. He prefers the right medication as needed and will not prescribe unnecessary diagnosis unless required. I strongly recommend Dr. Sandeep for all my well wishers, Friends and relatives. Thanks to Dr. Sandeep again for his special care for my family. I sincerely appreciate!!!
