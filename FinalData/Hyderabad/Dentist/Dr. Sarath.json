I had to undergo some cavity fillings and a root canal treatment.\nI met Dr. Sharath, who explained the problem and corrective measures very patiently. He explained that the root canal treatment will be done by another dentist and he will be taking care of crown measurement, fixtures, etc. But The Dental Specialists will overall take care of everything. \nSince, their primary RCT specialist was away on long leaves, they had another consultant, Dr. Kirit for RCT. Since,I couldn't find any feedback for him, I met him and decided to undergo treatment. The entire treatment was extremely smooth and painless. He turned to be a very ******* *** experienced practitioner!!\nCrown measurement and filling of cavity were done by Dr. Sharath. He handled it very deftly and the procedure was completed very efficiently and to my satisfaction. \nI found the entire experience at The Dental Specialists, Banjara Hills very satisfying. The doctors are very experienced, clinic is hygienic and pricing is fair. I will definitely recommend this place. ",

While I was googling a lot about the procedure and it's side effects, i realised that it is a pretty serious issue as the nerve was running close to the wisdom tooth and it's extraction should be done by an experienced dental surgeon. The more I read about the issue online, the more I was scared to get the procedure done. But, as the pain was unbearable i had to get it done with. I was now trying to find the best place to get the tooth extracted. I stumbled upon the Dental Specialists online and enquired about it to a couple of friends who had been here. After convincing myself that this is the best place to get my tooth extracted, i got an appointment scheduled. The surgery was done by Dr Naidu. He was so patient and polite that he first allayed my concerns and kept explaining the procedure as he went along removing the tooth. I am really thankful to him, Dr. Sarath and the entire team at the Dental Specialists for doing a great job!",

Since,I couldn't find any feedback for him, I met him and decided to undergo treatment. The entire treatment was extremely smooth and painless. He turned to be a very ******* *** experienced practitioner!!\nCrown measurement and filling of cavity were done by Dr. Sharath. He handled it very deftly and the procedure was completed very efficiently and to my satisfaction. \nI found the entire experience at The Dental Specialists, Banjara Hills very satisfying. The doctors are very experienced, clinic is hygienic and pricing is fair. I will definitely recommend this place. ",

While I was googling a lot about the procedure and it's side effects, i realised that it is a pretty serious issue as the nerve was running close to the wisdom tooth and it's extraction should be done by an experienced dental surgeon. The more I read about the issue online, the more I was scared to get the procedure done. But, as the pain was unbearable i had to get it done with. I was now trying to find the best place to get the tooth extracted. I stumbled upon the Dental Specialists online and enquired about it to a couple of friends who had been here. After convincing myself that this is the best place to get my tooth extracted, i got an appointment scheduled. The surgery was done by Dr Naidu. He was so patient and polite that he first allayed my concerns and kept explaining the procedure as he went along removing the tooth. I am really thankful to him, Dr. Sarath and the entire team at the Dental Specialists for doing a great job!",
