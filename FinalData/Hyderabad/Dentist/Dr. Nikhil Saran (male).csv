I am glad to know Dr. Nikhil and would like to share my case. I know Dr. Nikhil since early 2012 when I first went to his clinic in madhapur for a check-up. The reason for my visit was to take his opinion after being a victim of an improperly fitted bridge for my upper right premolar and canines.

I had no problem with my teeth until I ...met with a car accident in 1997 when my right mandible was fractured. Also, I lost my upper two incisors. My mandible was tightened  for 4 weeks (during which I survived on liquid diet) and the fracture was healed. Later, my broken incisors were root canal treated and replaced with a new bridge. During all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out.

Meanwhile, my sinusitis problem was complicated, probably by these treatments and ended up in a tooth abscess of one of the neighboring canine tooth. This was diagnosed when I went to India (Chennai, my home town) for a visit. Although, they diagnosed the tooth abscess, the dentist I saw in Chennai did a sloppy job while taking the measurements for my new bridge, which I needed after extracting the abscessed tooth. As a result the bridge loosened day after day and came out completely by the time I returned back to Worcester UK. I was so fortunate that I could see Dr. Nikhil who identified and fixed the problem. Till today, I had no hint of any issues with the bridge. I am very thankful to Dr. Nikhil and her skillful approach to address my case. My sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr. Nikhil, my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.",2016-08-03 17:43:36,False,True,Selvam Palanimalai,,,

He was also pretty cocky and refused to believe that my fillings were done in India at the year I mentioned they were. He kept telling me it is impossible and if I was sure and how this was never available and I must not know for sure.Well I got them done in one of the best places in Bombay and why would I lie I am not crazy.

Prior to visiting I had emailed x-rays, quite frankly my mouth was a mess and Dr Nikhil had came back with a comprehensive treatment plan. Around 10 years ago I several mini implants fitted, since which time I have been beset with problems such as repeated infection, implant failure and detached bridge. Dr Nikhil was by far the simplest, most honest, open and person centred practitioner I had contacted. He inspired confidence and made me feel that something could be done to help, despite many dentists telling me they could not help. The treatment I received was first class. It was exactly as detailed in his treatment plans. There were no hidden costs and overall the cost was great value. So much cheaper than it is in the UK. The surgery was realitevly painless and conducted in hygienic surroundings. Vista Dental Studio is located in hitec city, a leafy Suburb of hyderabad. It is easily reached by local road transport. I am due to return in four weeks time for part two of my treatment plan and feel no trepidation whatsoever!! Dr Nikhil and his lovely family took me out for breakfast in a Local South Indian Dabha......well tasty and such a kind gesture.

But As per the record available with me for your patient name nikhil which came with the problem of dislodged crown which was not done by me of my staff, So we re fixed it.  doing so we need to do the cleaning of tooth and of  the old crown for which we charged you Rs. 500 only.
