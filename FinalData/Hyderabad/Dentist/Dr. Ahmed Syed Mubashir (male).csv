None,None,0,0,YES,I had taken my mother to Dr. Mubashir after failed implants by two other dentists which kept coming off on their own. We finally got the right suggestion and treatment by Dr. Mubashir who did a very detailed job with a lot of patience. Extremely professional. He cleared all our queries and guided us the right way. Thoroughly content with the treatment.,2020-10-27 14:25:14,False,True,Swathi datla,,,
