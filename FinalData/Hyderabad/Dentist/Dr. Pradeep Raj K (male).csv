"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"I have visited the Ethos Dental clinic for tooth ache. I was overwhelmed to see a clinic maintained hygiene with good ambience from the staff. Coming to the treatment, Dr Pradeep Raj gave a clear explanation about the dental issue and suggested to have a root canal treatment. I felt the charges provided by them are reasonable and affordable for the high quality services they have provided to me.  After treatment, I never had an experience that Clinic staff giving calls to the patients with regards to  post treatment care and I am happy about it.

I would like convey thanks to Dr Pradeep Raj sir and his entire team  for taking utmost care and extended support for  pre & post treatment.

I got to know from the Doctor that they have recently extended their services for Skin & Hair clinic. I met Dr Vasavi and had  Laser hair removal session and Hydra Facial treatment. 

I want stress few points with regards to the services.

Utmost care
