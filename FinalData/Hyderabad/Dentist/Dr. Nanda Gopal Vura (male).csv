None,None,0,0,YES,I was extremely scared to show my half erupted wisdom tooth which had decay but Dr Nanda gopal garu was very friendly and patient with me and my queries. He explained the procedure in advance so I had a mental picture of what would happen . During the day of surgery I was a bit calm as I trusted the doctors words. I got all four of my wisdom tooth out within 45 mins time and i didn’t experience any pain. Also doctors assistant Rajanikanth was helpful and polite. You can visit Dr. Nanda Gopal without any fear. I also like to thank Dr. Nanda Gopal for taking good care of me. ,2021-08-16 12:13:36,False,True,Bindhya,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"Dr. nanda gopal is an excellent and incredibly gentle dentist. Dr. nanda listens to his patients and does not recommend unnecessary dental procedures, I went to see him for my mum and myself and was very happy with the diagnosis that he gave and the help he offered without me asking, was very kind of him, Most of my prior dental providers have not been so good with identifying the problem mum had. I have a great deal of respect for Dr.nanda Gopal and his  staff, there are also very friendly and create a relaxing ambience prior to any procedure being performed. I find this to be a must have for those who do not like going to the dentist!  ",2019-11-03 06:52:12,False,True,calvin powell,,,
None,None,0,0,YES,"I had my wisdom teeth extracted by Dr Nanda Gopal and must say he did a fab job. He took time to explain the whole process initially itself which calmed me down. The extraction process was also very smooth and painless. 

He clearly explained what post extraction care to be taken etc. On the whole a very skilled doctor that I would recommend for dental issues. ",2022-07-22 05:42:48,False,True,Vinutha,,,
