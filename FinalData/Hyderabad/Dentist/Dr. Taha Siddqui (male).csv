,,0,0,YES,"I generally avoid going to the dentist so was quite nervous (had put off getting my teeth straightened for years because of this) but couldn‚Äôt have asked for better care ‚Äì Dr Taha Siddiqui answered all my questions and cleared my doubts confidently with a smile. Really professional service and the highest levels of dental care ‚Äì so felt very well looked after throughout the process.
Thank you so much for the smooth and pain free orthodontic treatment over the last 1 year. Though it has been a long journey, but the result is truly unbelievable. When I look at the mirror, I am still amazed at the transformation of my teeth. I never thought such improvement would be possible. Dr Taha Siddiqui explained the different treatment options. But as an adult seeking orthodontic treatment, the invisalign treatment option was clearly the right choice for me as a clear alternative to braces. Most of my colleagues did not even notice that I was wearing it and therefore I was less self-conscious of it as well and more confident. I am extremely happy with my teeth and I can now smile with confidence!‚Äù
Add to that the numerous compliments I‚Äôve had on my journey of perfectly straight teeth! Would give the highest possible recommendation.‚Äù

Dr. Azher, is an excellent oral surgeon. 
You feel a great sense of reassurance from him and the rest of the staff. From the minute I came in the office I was greeted with pleasant smiles and given all the information I needed aftercare since I had four wisdom teeth extractions. 
I was comfortable and good throughout the procedure.

If there was a sixth-star option‚ÄîDucchene Smiles would deserve it! Getting braces when you're 40 isn't fun...but Dr. Taha and his team provided me with an incredible orthodontic experience, so I was able to manage it!¬† The office is welcoming and you feel like family when you're there.
