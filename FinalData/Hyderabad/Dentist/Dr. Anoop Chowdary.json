Coming to the treatment, Initially after the consultation, Doc Anoop, went with the checkup and explained me every point. That was very clear and straight forward. He also, helped me with the alternatives for the same result. This helps the client to save time and one need not invest more funds than required. Usually most of the Dental clinics will not invest their time to deeply investigate the root cause. But here, Anoop was very patient and polite through out the treatment. I can see his professionalism here. He does his work with perfection! The environment was very pleasant and staff was very friendly. I strongly recommended Dental Clinic for any dental treatment. Fully satisfied with the work. Thank you Expert Dentals for the great service\u2728\u263a\ufe0f",

Out of interest Dr.Anoop sir contacted Bangalore Dental lab and discussed with them to get a replacement via courier. He has taken my teeth measurement and sent via courier to Bangalore and got replacement Crown. Dr.Anoop sir fixed the Crown without any pain.

Coming to the treatment, Initially after the consultation, Doc Anoop, went with the checkup and explained me every point. That was very clear and straight forward. He also, helped me with the alternatives for the same result. This helps the client to save time and one need not invest more funds than required. Usually most of the Dental clinics will not invest their time to deeply investigate the root cause. But here, Anoop was very patient and polite through out the treatment. I can see his professionalism here. He does his work with perfection! The environment was very pleasant and staff was very friendly. I strongly recommended Dental Clinic for any dental treatment. Fully satisfied with the work. Thank you Expert Dentals for the great service\u2728\u263a\ufe0f",

Out of interest Dr.Anoop sir contacted Bangalore Dental lab and discussed with them to get a replacement via courier. He has taken my teeth measurement and sent via courier to Bangalore and got replacement Crown. Dr.Anoop sir fixed the Crown without any pain.
