Dr Surendra did a scan and he quickly diagnosed the underlying infection which i am totally unaware of. He explained the issue clearly, that the root canal which is done before from another hospital got infected and  it will affect the other tooth if unaddressed and that needs to be removed immediately. As it\u2019s my last trimester i was very scared for the procedures but Dr Surendra and the team assured and gave me a very smooth experience. After my first appointment, It gave a sense of belief that I was in very safe hands and all the procedures are done with little and no pain. Overall, it doesn\u2019t feel like you are in a hospital, the ambience gives you a very calming and positive energy and you don\u2019t feel like you are in a clinic. I will definitely visit for any issues/treatments in the future and recommend to my friends and family. Thanks for the amazing experience.",

My wife was previously treated there and they did an amazing job then. So I knew I was in safe hands. They have clearly explained to me that I will need to opt for a root canal of one tooth and a crown as there was too much decay and could pose a risk to the entire tooth if left unaddressed, get a gingivitis laser treatment to maintain the health of my gums and also to get one of my wisdom tooth removed as that was posing a risk to the tooth next to it and also causing inflammation in that area.\n\nWhat really impressed me the most and is that they didn\u2019t hurry me, and took their time in explaining my diagnosis and all the pros and cons associated. So I had opted to address all the issues than delaying them later on. \n\nThe entire treatment process was very smooth and they were very accommodative of my requests with respect to scheduling the appointments. Also, they do not see multiple patients at the same time, so the entire staff\u2019s focus will just be on your during any procedure. It gave a sense of belief that I was in very safe hands. My wisdom tooth extraction was a bit tedious because I had bulbous roots and the tooth could not be pulled in one go. But Dr Surendra was very calm and patient throughout the procedure walking me through the steps which helped with my anxiety. All the other procedures were a walk in the park with little or no pain. Dr Radhika and her team had handled them very well.\n\nOverall, the clinic had this soothing spa-like ambience (the reason why it probably is called dental spa and wholeness, instead of clinic) and not like a hospital which is really great because I felt very comfortable as I am someone who doesn\u2019t like the hospital atmosphere much.\n\nDefinitely would be recommending to my friends.\n\nKeep up the awesome work, guys!",

It\u2019s just been recently that I had a tooth that needed to be extracted, besides receding gums and abscesses. I knew sooner or later I would have to get dentures, hence my search for implants. I heard about Dr.Surendra from Google. The more I search, the more intrigued I was with them. From the start with a phone consult until the end, a new smile, I felt so comfortable. The staff makes you feel as family and Dr. Surendra was wonderful. I was shocked as I was never nervous or scared, which has never happened in a dental office. Having 32 teeth extracted was the calmest experience I have ever had. I can\u2019t explain it yet I was so at peace. I was shocked with how much details went into measuring and creating my teeth. The amount I was charged is WELL worth it. I heard from others of all the trouble, pain and months to years before they can have their permanent teeth. WithDr.Surendra, there was NO pain at all, none.  If you need a new smile I don\u2019t know why you would not go to where they specialize in their trade of making great smiles. They seem to good to be true, yet they are not just good, they are great. I can\u2019t say enough about Dr.Surendra and how they changed my life for the better. Thank you Dr.Surendra and staff , *** **** *** ***** *** ***** Highly recommended for every one who deserve best smile.",

He is experienced and well motivated team.\n\nThen I found Dr.Surendra at shambhala dental spa and team explained everything clearly and they motivated me like friends to gain confidence and move further.. I am scared of the surgery coz I thought only one wisdom teeth removal but after initial assessment other teeth also spoiled and out of shape. \nAgain I am scared and thinking about to choose one teeth or two. I tortured them with mutiple questions and they patiently answered everything and especially Dr. Radhika did a great job to bear me and answered all queries.\nFinally succesfully  Both teeth removed and its been 4 months now and I am fine with the surgery.\n\nThanks a lot Dr. Surendra and Radhika..Appreciate your support.\n\n",

Dr Surendra did a scan and he quickly diagnosed the underlying infection which i am totally unaware of. He explained the issue clearly, that the root canal which is done before from another hospital got infected and  it will affect the other tooth if unaddressed and that needs to be removed immediately. As it\u2019s my last trimester i was very scared for the procedures but Dr Surendra and the team assured and gave me a very smooth experience. After my first appointment, It gave a sense of belief that I was in very safe hands and all the procedures are done with little and no pain. Overall, it doesn\u2019t feel like you are in a hospital, the ambience gives you a very calming and positive energy and you don\u2019t feel like you are in a clinic. I will definitely visit for any issues/treatments in the future and recommend to my friends and family. Thanks for the amazing experience.",

My wife was previously treated there and they did an amazing job then. So I knew I was in safe hands. They have clearly explained to me that I will need to opt for a root canal of one tooth and a crown as there was too much decay and could pose a risk to the entire tooth if left unaddressed, get a gingivitis laser treatment to maintain the health of my gums and also to get one of my wisdom tooth removed as that was posing a risk to the tooth next to it and also causing inflammation in that area.\n\nWhat really impressed me the most and is that they didn\u2019t hurry me, and took their time in explaining my diagnosis and all the pros and cons associated. So I had opted to address all the issues than delaying them later on. \n\nThe entire treatment process was very smooth and they were very accommodative of my requests with respect to scheduling the appointments. Also, they do not see multiple patients at the same time, so the entire staff\u2019s focus will just be on your during any procedure. It gave a sense of belief that I was in very safe hands. My wisdom tooth extraction was a bit tedious because I had bulbous roots and the tooth could not be pulled in one go. But Dr Surendra was very calm and patient throughout the procedure walking me through the steps which helped with my anxiety. All the other procedures were a walk in the park with little or no pain. Dr Radhika and her team had handled them very well.\n\nOverall, the clinic had this soothing spa-like ambience (the reason why it probably is called dental spa and wholeness, instead of clinic) and not like a hospital which is really great because I felt very comfortable as I am someone who doesn\u2019t like the hospital atmosphere much.\n\nDefinitely would be recommending to my friends.\n\nKeep up the awesome work, guys!",

It\u2019s just been recently that I had a tooth that needed to be extracted, besides receding gums and abscesses. I knew sooner or later I would have to get dentures, hence my search for implants. I heard about Dr.Surendra from Google. The more I search, the more intrigued I was with them. From the start with a phone consult until the end, a new smile, I felt so comfortable. The staff makes you feel as family and Dr. Surendra was wonderful. I was shocked as I was never nervous or scared, which has never happened in a dental office. Having 32 teeth extracted was the calmest experience I have ever had. I can\u2019t explain it yet I was so at peace. I was shocked with how much details went into measuring and creating my teeth. The amount I was charged is WELL worth it. I heard from others of all the trouble, pain and months to years before they can have their permanent teeth. WithDr.Surendra, there was NO pain at all, none.  If you need a new smile I don\u2019t know why you would not go to where they specialize in their trade of making great smiles. They seem to good to be true, yet they are not just good, they are great. I can\u2019t say enough about Dr.Surendra and how they changed my life for the better. Thank you Dr.Surendra and staff , *** **** *** ***** *** ***** Highly recommended for every one who deserve best smile.",

He is experienced and well motivated team.\n\nThen I found Dr.Surendra at shambhala dental spa and team explained everything clearly and they motivated me like friends to gain confidence and move further.. I am scared of the surgery coz I thought only one wisdom teeth removal but after initial assessment other teeth also spoiled and out of shape. \nAgain I am scared and thinking about to choose one teeth or two. I tortured them with mutiple questions and they patiently answered everything and especially Dr. Radhika did a great job to bear me and answered all queries.\nFinally succesfully  Both teeth removed and its been 4 months now and I am fine with the surgery.\n\nThanks a lot Dr. Surendra and Radhika..Appreciate your support.\n\n",

One is extraction of all the teeth and go for the clip and the second is few implants then crown. I was not ok with either option. Then approached Shambhala. Dr Surendra kumar checked my teeth and suggested full mouth rehabilitation where implants or teeth removal is not taking place. I was ok with this and started treetment. \nDr.  Sharanya handled the case very gently. Some RCs are done by Dr. Varsha. They both are excellent. Before every process they made me feel comfortable. Before the treatment starts  Dr. Surendra kumar and Dr. Radhika cleared all my doubts patiently and clearly. When the laser gum surgery and root canals r completed, temporary crown is fixed. When the final crown is made Dr. Surendra Kumar made sure everything looks perfect. And it came out very well. My smile line is changed. I had a doubt about the clarity in speech so what I did is i read lalitha, recorded and heard. It's perfect. \n   Shambhala is very pleasant place and I had devine feel always. Hazle free appointment system. I definitely recommend Shambhala to my friends and relatives. Thank you Dr. Surendra Kumar, Dr. Radhika, Dr. Sharanya and Dr. Varsha\ud83d\ude0a",

My story relates much to the agony of the \u201cwrench\u201d - more so, when almost five major dental clinics in the USA openly denied to accept me as a patient as I had what they described as a rare challenge in dental parlance. That was when I decided to accept it as my fate and decided to live with the pain the rest of my life. The lord was truly benevolent to me in arranging a meeting with Dr. Alluri of Shambhala in September of 2021. Today after nine months of treatment I am free of all dental problems. I have regained my joyful demeanor and confidence. Shambhala to me is a temple where you see a divine energy work on you to correct your problem. There is no challenge they cannot address face front. The treatment they offer is extremely professional and personable. The attention to detail they offer is comparable to \u201cmother\u2019s love\u201d. The atmosphere is so very calm and composed and serene where the fear of the dental chair is soon forgotten as they perform a miracle on you. I would recommend this clinic and their team to any patient with dental issues. Walk in with your problems and believe me \u2013 you will walk out pain and problem free. Yes- With a radiant smile on your face!",

The reason for my visit was to take his opinion after being a victim of an improperly fitted bridge for my upper right premolar and canines.\nI had no problem with my teeth until I ...met with a car accident in 2015 when my right mandible was fractured. Also, I lost my upper two incisors. My mandible was immobilized for 4 weeks (during which I survived on liquid diet) and the fracture was healed. Later, my broken incisors were root canal treated and replaced with a new bridge. During all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out.\nI was so fortunate that I could see Dr. Surendra who identified and fixed the problem. Till today, I had no hint of any issues with the bridge. I am very thankful to Dr. Surendra  and his skillful approach to address my case. My sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr. Surendra  my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.\n\n",

And so I came here in extreme pain, anxiety and had a major problem.\n\nThe treatment was a total restoration of my mouth. I would say when people ask me that question that Dr.Surendra  saved my life came close to that \u2014 probably not clinically, but mentally and I\u2019d had very bad experiences with a dentist longtime in the past and just had not gone to dentists for a long time. And so finally, a tooth broke in the front.\n\nDr.Surendra took me in without question we scoped out a regimen of improvement and over the next two or three months totally restored my mouth with nine or ten implants. So the results were extraordinary. I went from not smiling for 10 or 15 years, or smiling with my hands in front of my mouth to being unconscious of that in any surrounding. It had a huge difference in the way I spoke. The way I address people. Again, I\u2019m a professor, so I\u2019m always in control of students or faculty and I really had a huge difference just in my well-being.\n\nSo what impressed me most about Dr.Surendra and the office was they never questioned. So when I first came here, decades of not having any dentist, Dr.Surendra never said, \u201cgee, what\u2019s the problem\u201d. He never gave a judgment on what the problem was. He just said, \u201clet\u2019s fix this\u201d.\n\nHe and the staff are just trusting extensions of who I am and what I do. I\u2019d clearly recommend and have recommended individuals, anybody I meet who is looking for a dentist, I want to say a clinician in dentistry. I\u2019m going to recommend, here. And I think it\u2019s a combination of that for me, the importance of technology and trust and also proximity.",

Wait times are minimal and they also accomodate emergency visits on short notice. During procedures, the clinic is very empathetic to patient well being and never rushes. Their expertise in handling seniors is remarkable. At far less cost than one can in a country like US, we can get best of dental care at our comfortable pace. Highly recommend this clinic for any dental work.",

We won't experience the depressing clinic-and-hospital-smell mood. Instead, we'll feel positive. Extremely hygienic. All doctors are quite friendly.\n\nDr. Surendra, who can chase away your fear. In contrast to other dental clinics I've visited, he is very understanding of my worries and anxiety during tooth extraction sessions., and calmly explained the entire procedure. And Dr. Radhika patiently handled my residual infections throughout the course of treatment.\n\nDr. Saranya handled my root canal and crown fittings, and she was kind to me throughout the process and always had a smile on her face, which made me feel less anxious.\n\nHighly recommended.

Dr.Radhika on the other hand, would be someone who could engage while you're there at the hospital and provide dental advises beforehand. The environment is so peaceful that you don't feel like you're at a dental clinic. On the whole, if you're doubtful, please don't just visit and you won't regret. On a side note, i have tried massage chair for approx 6 minutes which was amazing!! ",

He explained each and every step of the procedure that my anxiety faded eventually. This was the best dental experience i have ever had. The assurance from the doctor and regular follow ups in between the appointments really shows how much do they care about patients. I am fortunate to get treated by him and  would gladly recommend him to fellow beings. \nRegards. ",

Dr Surendra leads his organisation with absolute passion for work and  deep sense of commitment to each patient.  I can't think of another dental set up where the patients dental needs and timelines can be met with such perfection. Added to this is the highly aesthetic and spiritual environment of the clinic which makes the experience truly a  wholesome one.

Speaking about \"Shambla\" it has completly new look and looks fabulous.  Pain relieving Ambience and soothing music makes patient feel so comfortable.This is not a place where doctor's are so hurry for next patient and its awsome place .Another best part of Dr.surendra is like he used to spend much time with patient to find the root cause of problem.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a warm and friendly staff who made me feel comfortable and welcome. The office itself was immaculate and had a calming atmosphere that put me at ease.\nI had a couple of crowns that needed to be fixed, along with a root canal. From start to finish, the doctor and their team provided exceptional care and support. They were friendly, attentive, and highly skilled, and I felt at ease throughout the entire process.\n\nThe doctor took the time to explain the procedures to me and answered all of my questions thoroughly. They were also very gentle and made sure I was comfortable at all times. The work they did was outstanding, and my teeth look and feel better than ever.\n\nI highly recommend this dental doctor to anyone in need of dental care. Their professionalism, expertise, and compassionate care truly set them apart. Thank you for everything!",
