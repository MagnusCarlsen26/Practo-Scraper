I visited their clinic in kokapet as I was having a gap between my 2 teeth where food was getting stuck. My wife was previously treated there and they did an amazing job then. So I knew I was in safe hands. They have clearly explained to me that I will need to opt for a root canal of one tooth and a crown as there was too much decay and could pose a risk to the entire tooth if left unaddressed, get a gingivitis laser treatment to maintain the health of my gums and also to get one of my wisdom tooth removed as that was posing a risk to the tooth next to it and also causing inflammation in that area.

What really impressed me the most and is that they didn‚Äôt hurry me, and took their time in explaining my diagnosis and all the pros and cons associated. So I had opted to address all the issues than delaying them later on. 

The entire treatment process was very smooth and they were very accommodative of my requests with respect to scheduling the appointments. Also, they do not see multiple patients at the same time, so the entire staff‚Äôs focus will just be on your during any procedure. It gave a sense of belief that I was in very safe hands. My wisdom tooth extraction was a bit tedious because I had bulbous roots and the tooth could not be pulled in one go. But Dr Surendra was very calm and patient throughout the procedure walking me through the steps which helped with my anxiety. All the other procedures were a walk in the park with little or no pain. Dr Radhika and her team had handled them very well.

Overall, the clinic had this soothing spa-like ambience (the reason why it probably is called dental spa and wholeness, instead of clinic) and not like a hospital which is really great because I felt very comfortable as I am someone who doesn‚Äôt like the hospital atmosphere much.

One is extraction of all the teeth and go for the clip and the second is few implants then crown. I was not ok with either option. Then approached Shambhala. Dr Surendra kumar checked my teeth and suggested full mouth rehabilitation where implants or teeth removal is not taking place. I was ok with this and started treetment. 
Dr.  Sharanya handled the case very gently. Some RCs are done by Dr. Varsha. They both are excellent. Before every process they made me feel comfortable. Before the treatment starts  Dr. Surendra kumar and Dr. Radhika cleared all my doubts patiently and clearly. When the laser gum surgery and root canals r completed, temporary crown is fixed.

I know Dr. Surendra since early 2016 when I first went to his clinic in Shambhala for a check-up. The reason for my visit was to take his opinion after being a victim of an improperly fitted bridge for my upper right premolar and canines.
I had no problem with my teeth until I ...met with a car accident in 2015 when my right mandible was fractured. Also, I lost my upper two incisors. My mandible was immobilized for 4 weeks (during which I survived on liquid diet) and the fracture was healed. Later, my broken incisors were root canal treated and replaced with a new bridge. During all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out.
I was so fortunate that I could see Dr. Surendra who identified and fixed the problem. Till today, I had no hint of any issues with the bridge. I am very thankful to Dr. Surendra  and his skillful approach to address my case. My sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr. Surendra  my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.

The treatment was a total restoration of my mouth.

And so finally, a tooth broke in the front.

Dr.Surendra took me in without question we scoped out a regimen of improvement and over the next two or three months totally restored my mouth with nine or ten implants. So the results were extraordinary. I went from not smiling for 10 or 15 years, or smiling with my hands in front of my mouth to being unconscious of that in any surrounding. It had a huge difference in the way I spoke. The way I address people. Again, I‚Äôm a professor, so I‚Äôm always in control of students or faculty and I really had a huge difference just in my well-being.

So what impressed me most about Dr.Surendra and the office was they never questioned. So when I first came here, decades of not having any dentist, Dr.Surendra never said, ‚Äúgee, what‚Äôs the problem‚Äù. He never gave a judgment on what the problem was. He just said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fix this‚Äù.

He and the staff are just trusting extensions of who I am and what I do. I‚Äôd clearly recommend and have recommended individuals, anybody I meet who is looking for a dentist, I want to say a clinician in dentistry. I‚Äôm going to recommend, here. And I think it‚Äôs a combination of that for me, the importance of technology and trust and also proximity.",2022-06-26 08:36:04,False,True,Verified Patient,You feedback will help us in continuing our good worküòä,2022-07-18T12:42:57+0000,Dr. Surendra Kumar Alluri
