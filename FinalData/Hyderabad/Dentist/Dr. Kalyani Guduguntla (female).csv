"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cosmetic/ Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"They are very friendly and experienced in treatment. Me and family all together went for treatments. We all are so happy. Mostly its Worth for what we are spending.Trustful doctors in treatment. As per my feelings we are so happy and will suggest this dental care to all my frds and relatives also if they have any dental problems. Charges are less compare with market and quality of treatment is more than what we are paying. I went for keeping caps which costing was More than 50k, but Dr.Kalyani suggest me cosmetic instead of caps and did the same for me, which was costing very less. Normally in hospitals they look for more bill. But here myself is ready to spend more than 50k but Dr. Kalyani explained very patiently about differences of caps and cosmetic treatment and completes my treatment in 10k. Which shows there sincerest and honesty towards treating patients.
