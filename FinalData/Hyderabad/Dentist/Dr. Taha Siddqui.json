Really professional service and the highest levels of dental care \u2013 so felt very well looked after throughout the process.\nThank you so much for the smooth and pain free orthodontic treatment over the last 1 year. Though it has been a long journey, but the result is truly unbelievable. When I look at the mirror, I am still amazed at the transformation of my teeth. I never thought such improvement would be possible. Dr Taha Siddiqui explained the different treatment options. But as an adult seeking orthodontic treatment, the invisalign treatment option was clearly the right choice for me as a clear alternative to braces. Most of my colleagues did not even notice that I was wearing it and therefore I was less self-conscious of it as well and more confident. I am extremely happy with my teeth and I can now smile with confidence!\u201d\nAdd to that the numerous compliments I\u2019ve had on my journey of perfectly straight teeth! Would give the highest possible recommendation.\u201d\n\nDr. Azher, is an excellent oral surgeon. \nYou feel a great sense of reassurance from him and the rest of the staff. From the minute I came in the office I was greeted with pleasant smiles and given all the information I needed aftercare since I had four wisdom teeth extractions. \nI was comfortable and good throughout the procedure.\n\nIf there was a sixth-star option\u2014Ducchene Smiles would deserve it! Getting braces when you're 40 isn't fun...but Dr. Taha and his team provided me with an incredible orthodontic experience, so I was able to manage it!\u00a0 The office is welcoming and you feel like family when you're there.\n\t",
