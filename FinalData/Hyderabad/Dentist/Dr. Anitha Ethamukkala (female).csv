"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Metal Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I went to Dr Anitha’s clinic for my daughter’s treatment after reading reviews online and I am glad we made the right decision. We had previously seen a dentist in KSA where half of her treatment for dental alignment was done. Ever since we moved to India we constantly received confusing remarks about the treatment she underwent , and most of the dentists we went to, said that the treatment was all wrong and will cost us a lot to get everything rectified.
Dr Anitha was the first and the only dentist who listened to our concerns patiently, who reassured us that nothing was majorly wrong with my daughter’s teeth and everything could be handled without worry. She is a highly skilled doctor, has very professional mannerisms and extremely kind towards patients and their families. A lot of dentists we consulted previously were only fees oriented  and didn’t really pay attention to our needs, Dr Anitha on the other hand has reasonable charges and will only do what is needed. My daughter kept asking her questions and she never hesitated in answering any of them. 
Me and my daughter are fully satisfied with the treatment we received and would recommend her to everyone else.
