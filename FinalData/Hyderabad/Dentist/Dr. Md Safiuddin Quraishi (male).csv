"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Crowns,Scaling / Polishing,Dental Fillings,Teeth Reshaping,",0,0,YES,"What matters to a person who is suffering, an immediate help at hand ! Such was my case, I remember it was the day of Eid and I had throbbing pain in my tooth, with lockdown in place and a fear of contamination I was skeptical to go out for a  consultation. Using Practo, I searched for a dentist closer to my home and I found Dr. Safi there. 
With uncertainty in my mind, I went ahead to get treatment. The moment you step in the clinic you will realize that you have come to the right place. It is a clean and a well maintained one. They practiced necessary sterilization protocols and from whatever I learnt in my education; I could see the sterilization practiced here. I was welcomed by Dr. Safi , who gave his appointments even on festival and looked into my case and suggested the treatment.
I was aware that I had 2-3 issues with my teeth and he actually pointed all of them out in my first visit. He described my dental issues in detail and also informed me the step by step process on how he will be approaching in multiple sittings.
I was amazed by his ********* *** *** patience to make me understand. He would even provide you multiple lines of treatment, which you can choose based on your pocket, he is not the one who would say the best ones are the expensive ones. 
I am writing this review after my complete treatment and I must say I am amazed and blessed that I could get this done on time and with a thorough professional, that he is. 
Now that you have read this review, you can understand that the time I took to pen this down shows my respect for the value of treatment provided. 
Please proceed and get treatment for you and your closed ones.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Our experience at The Dental Room was without a doubt the best dentist experience till date, across Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kolkata. The doctor listened to our needs very well, and explained in exact detail the course he was suggesting. The facilities were really clean, all COVID protocols were strictly followed. We were treated for a general checkup, cleaning + polishing and filling of a couple of cavities, very happy with the results. In the past, most of the dentists in our experience tried pushing toothpastes, brushes, floss and such - but here, the doctor encouraged us to buy his recommended stuff from Amazon or the local shop, so clearly he wasn‚Äôt trying to push any random stuff.
