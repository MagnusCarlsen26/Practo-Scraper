The treatment is painless even when they put the injection and this is amazing. 

If you want to know my whole experience with them, here you go:

I had a phobia of going to doctors and get treated. Unfortunately I faced toothache in one of my teeth. 
Basically I am from Haryana but was here in Hyderabad for my office work.
Believe me I literally searched for two days to find the best dental clinic in Hyderabad. Lot of people suggested me to go to dental clinic chains but I was not satisfied from inside. One day I found a link on Quora about The Dental Room. And I searched it on Google. After reading some reviews I felt that let's give it a try and I called them immediately. 
And the point the lady starting talking showed a professionalism of the clinic. You know that you judge a thing from the first impression.
Anyways I went to the clinic, talked with the Receptionist mam and finally to the doctor. 
Roohi Mam checked the issues thoroughly and gave me suggestions to go for root canal treatment. I heard that Root canal is painful treatment so I was very scared at that point. But after talking with mam I felt relaxed. 
For some reasons I had to move out of City for two weeks but I fixed in my mind to get treated from here only. 
I came back to Hyderabad and got my treatment from the mastermind Dr. Safi. Both are very friendly and great human beings.

After talking to him I felt unafraid.
The treatment went totally painless from injecting the local anaesthesia to the filling and cleaning. 
I cannot express in words they provided the service.
Thank you to the mam at the reception

A lot of thanks to Dr Safi and specially Roohi Mam who gave the confidence and great treatment. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó‚ò∫Ô∏è
