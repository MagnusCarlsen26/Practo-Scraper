None,None,0,0,YES,"Hi Everyone,
Few things that I really want appreciate Dr.Venkat and He blown out my thoughts and given a great Smile in my life. Before saying that Dr.Venkat is an extraordinary doctor, I want to tell Dr.Venkat that you are an extraordinary human being. Thanks for showing so much care and concern.

Sorry, My Name Suresh, working as a Software Professional and recently I met with an accident and lost my front right teeth and you know, I really did a lot of research in internet and visited  couple of hospitals to enquiry about the my teeth re-placement and few things that I heard on internet is IMPLANTS and BRIDGING.

After I saw/read a lot of videos/articles in youtube/blogs on IMPLANTS and BIRDGING of pros and corns and I feel IMPLANT is best compare to BRIDGING but it will take at least 3 months of time, but as a software professional I don't have that much of time and mean while I cant smile in front of client/colleagues and it was really embracing to me.

Finally I heared about Dr.Venkat is best for IMPLANTS and I visited to THE DENTAL SPECIALISTS hospital in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad and I had a small checkup and given a lot details and information about IMPLANTS and finally Dr.Venkat told that it will be done with in 30 mins...............I said Wow........and blown out my thoughts.

Dr.Venkat treating with modern and enhance technology with Fast and Zero Pain IMPLANT treatment and you know, he made it less than 30 mins and he made me smile :) with zero pain and the treatment is totally painless with less time.

Finally but not least and I got option to get Reimburse this treatment because of RTA (Road Transport Accident)

I also appreciate your staff for arranging tests, scheduling appointments and handling insurance procedures with seamless effort.

Saying “Thank You” seems so insufficient but I can find no words that truly express my feelings appropriately.

Finally thanks for giving such a great experience in my life :)

None,"Toothache,",0,0,YES,"It was a very great experience visiting the the dental specialists and meeting Dr.Venkat. After a visit to this clinic all the fears i had about a dentist went in vain. It is a very comfortable and modern day clinic.

All the doctors were very co-operative and the staff was very humble and gentle. I liked the atmosphere both inside and surrounding the clinic. 

I recommend Dr. Venkat's clinic to everyone as i am certain that no patient at the dental specialists will return unhappy or in a unsatisfied.

My treatment though a long one did not seem so because of Dr.Venkat and his team of dental specialists. they are not only named the dental specialists but are proficient in their work and can take time out for helping any patient day and night.

The office is immaculate, the staff is super friendly, and prompt. Everyone seemed very educated and knowledgeable when they were explaining things to me. Will certainly be booking my next cleaning here!

 I'm so glad I went to him -- the atmosphere in the office is tranquil, he is really nice to speak with, he did not make me feel guilty about not coming to the dentist in over a year, and he saw me immediately! I highly recommend him!
 
I went to Dr. Venkat as a recommendation from a coworker. She had extensive work done with her and had wondering reviews. Dr. Venkat was thorough and explained everything he was doing. He event asked when I needed to get back to work so he could fit within my schedule.Definitely a thumbs-up Highly recommmended!

Thank you for my new smile!

Every treatment I have had has been excellent. From a normal check up through to my recent cosmetic treatment (to even-up my smile), the dentist has been excellent! The dentist is always very clear & friendly & keeps track on my ongoing treatment.

I recently asked if there was anything they could do to even-up my smile (having a baby tooth at the front of my mouth) and I was given 6 options in different price ranges, but the recommendation was actually for the cheapest option! I love my 'new' tooth and now feel so much more confident, plus people keep commenting on my smile!

There's a really personal service from everyone at the surgery. Even though it's a surgery, it feels like going to a local treatment where they have known me for years & know what I need!

Staff very helpful(not to forget to mention professional dentists who will check u a head)and polite although I came one hour late they helped to finish fast to catch my plane

Actually he was >excellent
He is very polite and friendly, it seems that he is well experienced ,in my previous dental history I had problems with insufficient too much local anaeshesia and jaw joint problem and I am having dentist phobia because of that

The procedure was very comfortable pain free(despite involving some bone drilling) from even during infiltration of drug with local spray starter
It tooks for him less than 3m roughly to place the initial implant in place ! ,it was just as easy as nail polishing,since I am a physician  I can say experts who practised alot can do thier job fast and efficient
The post procedure x ray was just 100%
I went straightforward to my flight check-in,,,after wear off anaesthesia the pain was 0,,the amount of bleeding during and after was very minimal literaly cant mount to more than little ooze not even a drop of blood(yes),,now 24hrs of comfortness when I touch the area  with my tongue ,I feel like nothing in the gum ,even the drilled area of gingiva felt normaly intact

I will fly again fir the final second session ,the price here in UAE for example is horrible and its unlikely to find such unaffordable service (and experience! ,this is manually done procedures is a hand skill;operator dependant, dont be fooled by decorative arts)

None,None,0,0,YES,"After suffering from a bad set of teeth for number of years and due to the fact that the treatment in Australia is very expensive, I finally decided to look into international dentistry. 

My biggest worry was a missing toot in front with a lot of bone loss and dentists in Australia suggested a bone grafting procedure which can be a very time consuming process. Also most of my tooth were very sensitive and needed either root canal procedures or extractions. Another important factor was the time I can spend overseas due to my employment commitments.

After reading the testimonials and reviews on ‘The Dental Specialist’ I contacted the clinic and received all the answers for my concerns. Dr. Venkat recommended a full mouth rehabilitation and offered a ten day timescale to complete the procedure with a very reasonable price tag. Also, his implant technique does not require a bone grafting and can be completed in few days.

Dr. Venkat and his dental team were carried out all the necessary procedures in a very professional manner within the ten day period on a hygienically up to date clinical environment. One thing I noticed during my time at the clinic, highly appreciated and grateful for that when I stand in front of a mirror now, was the time spent by Dr. Venkat on varies fittings and adjustments to achieve his vision on how my set of teeth should look after the procedure.

After extensive research , I have approached Dental specialists Banjara hills branch.I was treated by Dr Venkata Nag for my dental implants.

Dr Venkata Nag treated me with great professionalism,  kept me informed with various options of dental implants and ensured I was treated with a good set of dental implants which restored my smile and confidence.

Team of dental professionals at the dental specialists are very approachable,  friendly and always guide patients about the treatment by providing them information and choices available for the treatment. 

Front desk staff are great and appointments booking is easy.Reminders about appointments and patient wellbeing follow up sms'es make the patients feel really assured and cared for. 

I had a follow up treatment after 3 years to check my implant condition. Dr Kamal Ramjee,  Dr Narendra,  Dr Saqib Sultan have been really helpful in assessing my implant progress, recommended for a couple of fillings to be done .I had my fillings done by Dr Saqib and he was fantastic in the way he has performed the procedure.  

Thank you Dr Venkata Nag and the entire Dental Specialists team and I would highly recommend anyone who are looking for their dental treatment to consider Dental specialists .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",None,0,0,YES,"A pain took my smile away; the Dental treatment restored my smile…. 

Every instance at this Dental Studio was a touch point of positive experience for my family and myself for Dental Health care at their Banjara Hills Branch. An introspection of various procedures; Root canal, Flap surgery, Implant (twice) which I have undergone over a decade testifies my delightful experience.  

Why I consider The Dental Specialists as a Dental Health Consultants for my family and me?

We have stumbled around a couple of clinics before we settled down here. Dr Venkat Ratna Nag adopts a tactical approach to the problem. His analytical ability to diagnosis, improved techniques in the procedure, a qualitative practice makes the patient feel comfortable, confident during the procedure and done-well feeling post treatment like that in my case. The updated equipment including Cameras and X-ray unit all in house, use of genuine dental material and above all the focus on the patient by the doctor and the supporting staff is remarkable. The environment is really a feel good factor; you don’t feel you walked into a Dental Clinic.


What made this Clinic an epic Dental Studio? 

The Doctor couple chose the Pain of Disciplin in developing a Clinic into a studio therefore they are the successful practitioners in dental health care in the City. Qualitative approach will always drive efforts to desired results. The Doctor couple’s relentless hard work to provide a holistic experience turns the pain into a smile. Availability of best equipment in house and a team of well qualified and experienced specialists differentiate this Studio from a conservative Clinic with a green colour curtain hanging on the door, a reception table outside and lone doctor inside a dingy room.

Do I recommend This Studio to others?

The tolerance level in Health care is zero precision level. Thousands of thoughts invades a patient’s mind before deciding where to go for his treatment. Perception leads decision making process. This perception becomes a reality post treatment. I am knowledgeable to the reality as one of most delighted patient. I highly recommend this dental Studio for all Dental Health consultations and treatments. Undoubtedly the treatment is affordable.
