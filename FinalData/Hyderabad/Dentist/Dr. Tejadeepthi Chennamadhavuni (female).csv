Again during the process, she didnt blindly gave me anesthesia but rather was asking me regularly if the RC process was painful. I had no pain and my root canal was done without anesthesia.

Shows excellent profesionalism --> I had appointments in the morning as well as in the late evening also, but whether its 10 AM or 9 PM appointment doctor maintains same energy levels and takes her own time to treat the patient. This is something that is rare in most of the doctors. Doctor has loads of patience and will clarify all the doubts with a smile.

Economical --> Few of my friends told me that their doctor never suggested them different variations of crowns but only the costliest ones. Whereas i was told about different types of crown and was given an option to choose and that too at a very good price.

I had also undergone RCT treatment in her clinic without pain. The doctor advised me to take pain killer, in case I had any pain, but it was unbelievably that I didn't experience any pain. Really a marvellous doctor.

Am a physicist and a mathematical modeller. As a researcher, if we need to do such engineering, we really need to do an RPT,scanning and then arrive at the precision. She was able to do it just by looking at the x rays and the measurements through her fingers. I really appreciate her devoted abilities and her experience in doing such measurements.

If she was a cardiologist or a vein specialist, she would have saved several lives, with her precision

Lastly, I came to know from the treatment, that sugar levels starts decreasing with reduced bacterial infection, which I was not able to reduce using allopathic drugs. Am not aware of how, this happens, but to all diabetics, whose sugar levels cannot be brought down, I suggest u to do a complete cavity cleaning to remove the bacterial infection.
