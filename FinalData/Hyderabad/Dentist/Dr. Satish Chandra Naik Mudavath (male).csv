None,"Toothache,",0,0,YES,"I have been going to see Dr. Satish Chandra for over a year and can’t say enough about his care. From entering his clinic and working with his kind assistant , to the cleanliness and order of his treatment room, all the way to the check out process – his office and professionalism is second to none. As for the care he provides I truly appreciated his approach of treating me as a whole, not a collection of potential disparate problems. Since he is a one doctor practice he seems to be able to manage his time in such a way that he gives himself time to think and focus on me as his patient – no hurried review of my file as he scampers from his previous patient in the next room, and therefore no rush out the door to his next patient. Now on to the appointment,My appointment ran on time, Dr. Satish Chandra  was really knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment, I would highly recommend this Clinic.That’s really nice, and not like the typical doctor. He truly cares about me as a patient and as an individual.He genuinely cares, he is professional and he makes an investment in the health and well being of his patients. That is as rare as hens’ teeth in today’s world.

To echo the other 5-star reviews, the doctor and his staff have been extremely helpful to me with a variety of my issues. Despite having a busy practice, I’m almost always able to schedule an appointment. Within a few minutes of my calling and receive a response to my email or phone questions often the same day. I’ve consulted many Dentists in my life, and it’s rare I’ve found one as knowledgable, accommodating, and concerned as Dr. Satish Chandra

Dr. Satish Chandra is a higher standard of health care, and I hope his model is the future of the medical industry!”
