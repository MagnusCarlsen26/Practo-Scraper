"Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","GIC Tooth Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Based on practo, we communicated to doctor for an appointment and we reached the place comfortably without any problems. Hoarding boards are advertised at the entrance of the roads, no difficulties in reaching to Brite Smiles Dental Clinic 01/05/2019 Dr. M. S. Sushma Susik.

It's on first floor, lift facilities are available, no worries!

Receptionist interaction Good.

A booklet is given for a patient track record Consultation charges are INR 200/- (Fixed)

Dr. M.S. Suushma Susik, investigation is excellent explained the patient problems briefly.

Our case was tooth filling, explained prices to patient to choose and I insisted for permanent filling and the pricing charged is equivalent to corporate dental clinics.

Based on her experience, I trusted the doctor & her treatment in clinic is good. 

Overall, it's my personal experience to first to know the prices before proceeding for treatment & it's better you should be knowing the current market prices to have a negotiation in case if it's on higher side.

Regarding the tooth filling in tooth's are okay at present but long term reviews will be posted soonest.

Money Charged for the patient treatment, bill is not given & even I forgot to ask due to lack of money *** ** ****** but it was transferred via Google Pay immediately when I came back to home on the same day i.e 1 May 2019.

Thank you
