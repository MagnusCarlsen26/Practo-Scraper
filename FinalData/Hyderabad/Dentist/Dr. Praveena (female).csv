"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Full Mouth Rehabilitation,Zirconia Crowns,",0,0,YES,"""Your teeth looking great. The doctor in India did a good job"". This is what my dentist in USA said after taking X-rays and checking the new crowns I got from India with full mouth restoration. “Thank you” I said with a big sigh of relief! The doctor in India she is referring to is Dr.Praveena. That assurance from dentist sums up my review of Dr.Praveena but how’s the overall treatment?

When the prosthodontist in US gave me the price and timeline for my full mouth restoration - I was flabbergasted to say the least. I checked with my regular dentist about getting my crowns done in India and she suggested find a good dentist in India who can understand the patient notes from US dentist. Glad my cousin Dr.Roopa Srinivas referred me to Dr.Praveena, who has studied and practiced in US earlier. Dr.Praveena immediately came up with a treatment plan considering all notes from my dentist. She stuck to the plan accommodated all the appointments to complete my full mouth restoration of putting crowns for 28 tooth in the tight schedule of my hasty India trip.  She treated me with utmost professionalism answering my numerous questions along the way. Knowing that I have many social commitments in my tight schedule she was careful to make my treatment and trial period	with crowns as less painful as possible. At the end Dr.Praveena gave all the treatment notes along with pictures, 

Let me close with an email I received from my Dentist office after I shared the notes from Dr.Praveena:

“After reviewing the Dr notes, feel that all treatment was done according to standard of care. Only what was needed was done- no additional treatment. Proper notes were taken, and treatment outcome was as expected.”
