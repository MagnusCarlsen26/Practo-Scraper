"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Hi there, my dental experience was awesome. Absolutely painless extraction of my wisdom tooth. I visited two dentists before Dr Nagaraj. Other dentists literally frightened me saying that I would need small surgery and stictches and may also experience temporary numbness of lip. But Dr Nagaraj was so confident that he could extract teeth without stiches and he did that. Excellent dentists for wisdome tooth extraction. I totally recommend.
