"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Dental Surgery,Dental Implant Fixing,General  Dentistry,Dental Fillings,Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"Dr. Harinath Reddy has been our family dentist since many years. (Tooth extractions, tooth implants, general checkups, etc.)

He has great attention to detail and takes time with every patient in doing procedures thoroughly yet painlessly. He also takes time to answer any and all questions. 

 In these days of corporate hospitals, Dr. Harinath's personalized attention to patients and their requirements is a welcome change. 

His approach to dentistry is to create a comfortable and pleasant environment for patients. Everything in his clinic - ambience, lighting, staff approach - is set up to be very calming and welcoming. 

If you've ever been afraid or reluctant of visiting dentists, pay a visit to Dr. Harinath's clinic once and see your perceptions change. 

Finally, just a personal opinion note on treatment charges: Hyd has many dental clinics. If you're looking for the lowest cost of treatment, I'm sure you'll find it at many other places in Hyd.  But if you are looking for premium services in a reasonable price range, then Dr. Harinath's expertise and overall value is well worth it. (When it comes to good teeth and a good smile, I don't want to compromise on quality just to save a few bucks. If you feel the same way, you should definitely consult Dr. Harinath for dental work.)
