"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Root canal specialist Dr. Aparajita of Apollo White Dental in Madhapur is one of the best in the twin-city for dental care and painless treatment. I visited the clinic multiple times in the past week for the treatment of my two teeth, one lower right and another lower left, which were causing a lot of inconvenience. Dr Aparajita treated me. She was excellent in diagnosing the problem and never had any ambiguities about the procedures of treatment. She not only explained to me about the problem explicitly, but also told me clearly during the treatment the medicines and other things she is using. I felt extremely comfortable during the multiple lengthy sittings as she treated with alacrity. She kept asking me whether I am getting any pain or feeling any discomfort repeatedly during the treatment. Her post treatment care was amazing, as she frequently enquired about the condition of the teeth. I liked her knowledge, confidence, energy and diligence which set apart a doctor from others in the profession.",2021-08-31 18:02:45,False,True,L Das,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Teeth Ache,",0,0,YES,"I injured my tooth while eating, early this year.Â  I never felt a pain like that on my tooth and was sure something is serious. However, I showed to three highly recommended doctors before coming to Dr. Aparajita. All the other doctors were unable to identify the injury and sometimes looking to cross sell other services that were not relevant. In case of persistent pain, the only default option that they said was root canal without a second thought. When I came to Dr. Aparajita, within few minutes she was able to identify the fracture on my tooth and provided me a detailed understanding of the issue as well as treatment options available. For the first time I was told about the fracture- all other senior doctors within the practice failed to even identify the issue in the first place. Post this first visit, Dr. Aparajita was my go to dentist! My treatment included some minor procedures which were a breeze. Her treatment approach is not intrusive and taking the easy route but trying to assess the different options with the patient with pros and cons in short and long term which gives you comfort in the process and makes you feel part of the decision making. I saved my tooth ultimately with minor surgery rather than loosing it completely and didnt even have to do a RCT which was the only option provided by all other doctors. Highly recommend Dr. Aparajita to all dental patients in Hyderabad.Â
