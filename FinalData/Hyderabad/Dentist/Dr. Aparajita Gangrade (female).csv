All the other doctors were unable to identify the injury and sometimes looking to cross sell other services that were not relevant. In case of persistent pain, the only default option that they said was root canal without a second thought. When I came to Dr. Aparajita, within few minutes she was able to identify the fracture on my tooth and provided me a detailed understanding of the issue as well as treatment options available. For the first time I was told about the fracture- all other senior doctors within the practice failed to even identify the issue in the first place. Post this first visit, Dr. Aparajita was my go to dentist! My treatment included some minor procedures which were a breeze. Her treatment approach is not intrusive and taking the easy route but trying to assess the different options with the patient with pros and cons in short and long term which gives you comfort in the process and makes you feel part of the decision making. I saved my tooth ultimately with minor surgery rather than loosing it completely and didnt even have to do a RCT which was the only option provided by all other doctors. Highly recommend Dr. Aparajita to all dental patients in Hyderabad.
