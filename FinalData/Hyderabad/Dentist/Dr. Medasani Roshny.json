Dental instrumentation sound was a little  daunting however I was made to feel at ease. Rather than as a customer/patient to their hospital I was treated very humanly and  an almost painless experience. \nGone are those days where you'll have trouble with x- rays being uncomfortable,  the newer tech offers faster and easier on mouth. Thank you Capital Dental Care and the staff.",

The entire check up process went very smoothly and I was explained everything properly. Dr.Yamini and Dr.Roshny were both very friendly and gave the best dental treatment. The teeth cleaning and polishing process was quick, simple and completely painless. I am very happy with the affordable treatment and thanks to them my smile is healthy and beautiful. I highly recommend the clinic to everyone looking for quality and ethical dental treatment.",
