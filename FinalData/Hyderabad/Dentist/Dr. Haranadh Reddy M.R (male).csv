Dr.Harinadha Reddy has explained clearly regarding the procedure and we were confident enough to go through the biopsy procedure by Dr. Swetcha on the same day due to the support and thorough explanation by Dr. Harinadha.  We had to wait for the biopsy reports for 15 days which Dr. Harinadha has already alerted us upfront.  Dr. Harinadha Reddy and Dr. Swetcha from same clinic even followed up with Pathology clinic to fasttrack the process and to provide 2 reports in 2 phases.  

After getting the biopsy report results, the team of both Dr. Harinadha and Dr. Swetcha clearly explained us regarding Oral Surgery procedure and assured us along with showing us the case studies from previous procedures and assured us that they will take care of removal of ameloblastic fibro odontoma in lower right mandibular region for my Son.  The entire procedure went through smoothly and the team has provided good support through out the Oral Surgery and recovery process.  The team has even trained me in doing a gauge pack in the lower jaw.

We have recently visited a oral surgeon in US and have done X-Ray of the surgery spot and the surgical spot has healed well with bone filling the jaw region.  The Oral Surgeon has passed on the complements to Dr. Harinadha reddy and team and told us that the surgeon has done a very good job in removing the Cyst.

I can't say enough about this team of individuals. They are just exceptional in every facet of their work. From their compassion, professional expertise and customer orientation, they are among the finest we have ever seen. We would'nt have come through my ""ordeal"" as well as I did without them.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Jaw Reshaping,Orthognathic Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I had an elongated lower jaw and severe under bite i.e. when I bite my lower jaw was 1 cm forward than my upper jaw due to which I had difficulty in chewing food as only 1 pair of teeth on each side would come one on one and the rest of teeth had no opposition. Even my pronunciation while talking was not clear some times.

I visited Dr. Haranadha reddy for my condition and he diagnosed me with server underbite (class 3 mal-occlusion) due to under development of upper jaw and over devolopment of lower jaw. He suggested for double jaw surgery(orthognathic surgery) which was the only treatment. After assessing my x-rays and teeth models they have planned for the surgery within a month the plan was to push my lower jaw backward and pull my upper jaw forward by which my bite will become normal.

Today I am 3 weeks post operation. I am very happy with the surgery and I have no complications. After the day of surgery I had swelling on my face which is experienced by every patient of jaw surgery, by the end of 1st week 60% of my swelling has disappeared though I felt weak initially after surgery by the end of 1st week I regained my energy levels and was able to do my daily activist on my own.
By the end of 2nd week 80% of my swelling disappeared and I even resumed my works by going to college regularly. By the end of 3rd week almost all of the visible swelling has gone and my speech had become clear.

If you are also having similar condition then I highly recommend you to get the surgery done as it is very much common now a day's and also the surgery is safe and affordable. There is no need to worry about complications as long as you are in the hands of an experienced suergon like Dr.Haranadha reddy. He and his team have done a great job and I am really happy with the outcome of the surgery and my above mentioned problems have solved and additionally I got a great improvement in my smile.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Orthognathic Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Reddy and his team were wonderful to work with. They explained everything thoroughly and tracked my progress. My first surgery went well, but there was one part that required a 2nd procedure. He and his team took the time to make sure it was done right, which I very much appreciate. 

I came to India from the US for my surgery. I was very well taken care of and felt safe the entire time. His team helped locate a helper that stayed with me for 3 weeks. It could not have been a more wonderful experience. One suggestion (unrelated to Dr. Reddy's office) is to make sure the hospital can process your credit card or money transfer. That was a bit stressful so check when you arrive that everything will go through.
