None,None,0,0,YES,"Would like to thank the entire team of TOOTH DOCS for their amazing support in making me smile and laugh more with much more confidence and comfort.
Had developed gaps in my lower teeth but was apprehensive to go for clips as I was 37 years and wasn't sure if the treatment would be as effective.
The awesome team of TOOTH DOCS: Dr. Sai Bharadwaz sir, Swetha mam and Ramya mam patiently explained every minute detail, answering all my queries and the possibility of a tooth extraction also in advance , being very transparent and giving me the options to decide.
Would like to specially thank Dr. Chaitanya sir for being so precisive, thorough and detailed. As per my layman's understanding, he is one of the most skilled doctors I have ever seen.
Would like to specially thank Dr. Anisha mam for being so patient and gentle with the tooth extraction. One of the finest doctors.
The other most important thing is the support staff who are very cooperative. There is minimal wait time for the appointment slot given
Thank you to the entire TEAM of TOOTH DOCS for making this journey so amazing and thoroughly enjoyable ❤️

None,None,0,0,YES,"I had a great experience with my dental treatment at the Tooth Docs dental clinic lately. All thanks to Dr. Swetha and Dr. Bharadwaj for explaining me every detail of the procedure I was undergoing. Through their Intra-Oral Scan, I was able to understand my entire dentition and the treatments required for maintaining a good oral health. The root canal treatment and the extraction procedures went on very smooth. I would highly recommend Tooth Docs for any kind of dental issue.
