"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"I went to The Dental Specialists after reading reviews on Practo for Dr. Sharath. I had to undergo some cavity fillings and a root canal treatment.
I met Dr. Sharath, who explained the problem and corrective measures very patiently. He explained that the root canal treatment will be done by another dentist and he will be taking care of crown measurement, fixtures, etc. But The Dental Specialists will overall take care of everything. 
Since, their primary RCT specialist was away on long leaves, they had another consultant, Dr. Kirit for RCT. Since,I couldn't find any feedback for him, I met him and decided to undergo treatment. The entire treatment was extremely smooth and painless. He turned to be a very ******* *** experienced practitioner!!
Crown measurement and filling of cavity were done by Dr. Sharath. He handled it very deftly and the procedure was completed very efficiently and to my satisfaction. 
I found the entire experience at The Dental Specialists, Banjara Hills very satisfying. The doctors are very experienced, clinic is hygienic and pricing is fair. I will definitely recommend this place. ",2018-06-03 10:58:03,False,True,Aakanksha,,,
