"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental X-Ray,Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,Scaling / Polishing,",0,0,YES,"How grateful I am that I can cite my experience with Dr.Venkat and would like to share my case.



I have a huge problem with my teeth from mychildhood and visited multiple doctors across in two telugu states

My tooth had been hurting and infected for years where i used to manage with temporary solutions and It caused me a lot of other systemic infections

which made my situation more critical and i am loosing the hope day by day. Thought of removing all the teeth as i am not able to bear the pain.

During all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out and multiple gum problems



I know Dr.Venkat since early 2014, when i met him at his hospital as a final hope before removing all my teeths.


within a span of few weeks i feel so comfortable and my problem got resolved which i am facing from my childhood


I find that Dr. Venkat takes time to explain all the procedures. he explains all the pros and cons of the treatment so that I can make an independent judgment and he never apply pressure if 

i was not ready for the procedure.


quality work has been done on my teeth.


Doctor Never gave me any false expections , he was very clear with his work and if patient forces to do any treatment which he feels not required, he dont recommed that procedure.(Amazing doctor)


The professionalism and friendliness of the Doctor is outstanding

Till today, I had no hint of any issues with my teeth and visit frequently for every 3 months for general check up



My sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr.Venkat my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.",2021-05-05 07:09:39,False,True,Ram,,,

Dr. Venkatesh is very professional, before proceeding with treatment we planned how we will be doing this in step by step manner and in every step sir explained me in detail so that I can make my own decision with cost.
Apart from cost effective treatment suggestions, sir also explained me how the treatment will go, he make sure that steps which are painful will be quick and easy come over.

Root canal treatment - Earlier I had root canal done at other dentist but this was the one of the smooth root canal i have experienced.

Wisdom tooth removal - I have heard that wisdom tooth is hardest to remove and also causes a lot pain in the procedure, but i was wrong. One moment he was talking to me how he will remove the tooth and in a minute it was out I didn't feel a thing. Of course afterwords medicine helps a lot too.

Implants - I had two implants done by Dr. Venkatesh. This was done in within a 45 minutes. This is not about timing but also perfection.
