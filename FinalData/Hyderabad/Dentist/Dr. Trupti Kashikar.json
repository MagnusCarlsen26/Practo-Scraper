If i had known all it required a proper cleaning, i wouldn't have hesitated at first, i wasted so much time trying internet solutions and worrying for no reason. This was my first time visit at dentist, and i am very much happy. Dr Trupti explained everything in a very friendly and professional manner. Also, She guided me and showed how to take care of my teeth so i won't get bleeding gums again. I will recommend her for sure. Don't think too much, if you're having a problem with your teeth. Must go to a dentist.",

It was causing unfavourable conditions for my overall oral health. Doctor advised me right and helped me prepare mentally for something scary such as wisdom tooth extraction. She was very careful, patient and equally concerned of the discomfort that a patient goes through this journey. She took her time with my very firm tooth. The extraction was difficult but there was no swelling and pain was bearable. Overall I am very satisfied and I realise that I am in good hands. I'll consult her for my future needs as well.",

She explained that i was having gingivitis and she immediately cleaned my gums and polished them. It stopped bleeding the next day like some magic. If i had known all it required a proper cleaning, i wouldn't have hesitated at first, i wasted so much time trying internet solutions and worrying for no reason. This was my first time visit at dentist, and i am very much happy. Dr Trupti explained everything in a very friendly and professional manner. Also, She guided me and showed how to take care of my teeth so i won't get bleeding gums again. I will recommend her for sure. Don't think too much, if you're having a problem with your teeth. Must go to a dentist.",

It was causing unfavourable conditions for my overall oral health. Doctor advised me right and helped me prepare mentally for something scary such as wisdom tooth extraction. She was very careful, patient and equally concerned of the discomfort that a patient goes through this journey. She took her time with my very firm tooth. The extraction was difficult but there was no swelling and pain was bearable. Overall I am very satisfied and I realise that I am in good hands. I'll consult her for my future needs as well.",
