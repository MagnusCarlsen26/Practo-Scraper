Dr.Harinadha Reddy has explained clearly regarding the procedure and we were confident enough to go through the biopsy procedure by Dr. Swetcha on the same day due to the support and thorough explanation by Dr. Harinadha.  We had to wait for the biopsy reports for 15 days which Dr. Harinadha has already alerted us upfront.  Dr. Harinadha Reddy and Dr. Swetcha from same clinic even followed up with Pathology clinic to fasttrack the process and to provide 2 reports in 2 phases.  \n\nAfter getting the biopsy report results, the team of both Dr. Harinadha and Dr. Swetcha clearly explained us regarding Oral Surgery procedure and assured us along with showing us the case studies from previous procedures and assured us that they will take care of removal of ameloblastic fibro odontoma in lower right mandibular region for my Son.  The entire procedure went through smoothly and the team has provided good support through out the Oral Surgery and recovery process.  The team has even trained me in doing a gauge pack in the lower jaw.\n\nWe have recently visited a oral surgeon in US and have done X-Ray of the surgery spot and the surgical spot has healed well with bone filling the jaw region.  The Oral Surgeon has passed on the complements to Dr. Harinadha reddy and team and told us that the surgeon has done a very good job in removing the Cyst.\n\nI can't say enough about this team of individuals. They are just exceptional in every facet of their work. From their compassion, professional expertise and customer orientation, they are among the finest we have ever seen. We would'nt have come through my \"ordeal\" as well as I did without them. There aren't enough stars to give them!!! Thank you is all I can say and you can have complete faith and confidence in the entire team.\n\n\n ",

Firstly I had many doubts and fears about the surgery like what happens if it gets more complicated after surgery etc. But doc harinath sir clearly explained about complications and solutions for it and assured me with the best results. Then I had decided to go with the surgery, it was 9 hour long surgery but a successful one.\n\nAs told before by the doc, there was swelling in the face and it healed very quickly than normal because of using the medication doc suggested. In 2 months my condition got normal and i started eating everything. To be frank I was really amazed by the results. Dr.Harinath Reddy sir and his team are very experienced and very friendly.  They made sure I feel comfortable throughout the treatment and post surgery time They followed me up until I recovered completely.\nThe best clinic for all the dental problems with latest equipments and  latest technologies. Highly experienced doctors and staff. They take very good precautions even in the time of corona pandemic. Clinic is very hygiene and all preventive measures are taken by the staff. \n\n",

Even my pronunciation while talking was not clear some times.\n\nI visited Dr. Haranadha reddy for my condition and he diagnosed me with server underbite (class 3 mal-occlusion) due to under development of upper jaw and over devolopment of lower jaw. He suggested for double jaw surgery(orthognathic surgery) which was the only treatment. After assessing my x-rays and teeth models they have planned for the surgery within a month the plan was to push my lower jaw backward and pull my upper jaw forward by which my bite will become normal.\n\nToday I am 3 weeks post operation. I am very happy with the surgery and I have no complications. After the day of surgery I had swelling on my face which is experienced by every patient of jaw surgery, by the end of 1st week 60% of my swelling has disappeared though I felt weak initially after surgery by the end of 1st week I regained my energy levels and was able to do my daily activist on my own.\nBy the end of 2nd week 80% of my swelling disappeared and I even resumed my works by going to college regularly. By the end of 3rd week almost all of the visible swelling has gone and my speech had become clear.\n\nIf you are also having similar condition then I highly recommend you to get the surgery done as it is very much common now a day's and also the surgery is safe and affordable. There is no need to worry about complications as long as you are in the hands of an experienced suergon like Dr.Haranadha reddy. He and his team have done a great job and I am really happy with the outcome of the surgery and my above mentioned problems have solved and additionally I got a great improvement in my smile. \n",

He and his team took the time to make sure it was done right, which I very much appreciate. \n\nI came to India from the US for my surgery. I was very well taken care of and felt safe the entire time. His team helped locate a helper that stayed with me for 3 weeks. It could not have been a more wonderful experience. One suggestion (unrelated to Dr. Reddy's office) is to make sure the hospital can process your credit card or money transfer. That was a bit stressful so check when you arrive that everything will go through.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the surgery I received and the bedside manner pre and post-op.  Dr. Reddy visited and checked on me often, even after I returned to the States. I would highly recommend his practice.",
