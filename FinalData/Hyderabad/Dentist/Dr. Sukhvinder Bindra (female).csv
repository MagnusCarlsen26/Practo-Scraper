,,0,0,YES,My experience with Dr Sukhvinder Bindra was wonderful. Iwas having severe shooting  pain on the left side of my face that continued till the backside of my left shoulder whenever I layed down. I came to her in a state wherein I was extremely afraid to eat or drink anything. Doc listened to my problem carefully & guided her team accordingly . She explained to me the various possible causes of the pain openly. She is an extremely humble person & immediately started discussing the case with other senior doctors in Hyderabad & Delhi. She & her doctors did the necessary procedures for alleviating my pain. I was extremely relieved. She is so caring & takes care of the smallest details too. During the entire period of treatment she & her doctors were in continuous correspondence with me and enquired about my wellbeing. I will always recommend her to any person suffering from dental problems. Dr. Bindra was true friend always ready to provide caring suggestions. There was complete openness regarding the problem & its treatment.  I thank her & her team once again.,2020-02-26 16:24:08,False,True,ananya,,,
