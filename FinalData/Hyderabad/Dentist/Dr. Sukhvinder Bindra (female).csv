None,None,0,0,YES,My experience with Dr Sukhvinder Bindra was wonderful. Iwas having severe shooting  pain on the left side of my face that continued till the backside of my left shoulder whenever I layed down. I came to her in a state wherein I was extremely afraid to eat or drink anything. Doc listened to my problem carefully & guided her team accordingly . She explained to me the various possible causes of the pain openly. She is an extremely humble person & immediately started discussing the case with other senior doctors in Hyderabad & Delhi. She & her doctors did the necessary procedures for alleviating my pain. I was extremely relieved. She is so caring & takes care of the smallest details too. During the entire period of treatment she & her doctors were in continuous correspondence with me and enquired about my wellbeing. I will always recommend her to any person suffering from dental problems. Dr. Bindra was true friend always ready to provide caring suggestions. There was complete openness regarding the problem & its treatment.  I thank her & her team once again.,2020-02-26 16:24:08,False,True,ananya,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Oral Ulcer,Swollen Gums,",0,0,YES,"I consulted Mrs Bindra for my mother who was suffering from Mouth Ulcers and Swollen Gums since past 4 months. I consulted nearly 5 doctors including Cancer specialist for the disease before meeting Mrs Bindra but the problem was not getting solved.

On the 2nd visit itself she by doing an biopsy diagnosed that my mother was suffering from lichen planus (A disease in which mouth Ulcers gets big and stays for a very long period).

Firstly her way of welcoming and greeting the patient is outstanding. Man she doesn't behave like a doctor........She treats her patients like they are her family members. She calls my mother Aunty. After diagnosis of the disease she very well explained the use, side effects, composition and price of the medicine she prescribed. No doctors does that in these days. They will simply write the medicine. The price of the medicine she prescribed was really negligible if I compare it with my past 6 Months experience of visiting different doctors.

She is one of a different kind in this world yaar. Very humble, soft spoken and always ready to help patients. ",2019-05-15 07:05:45,False,True,Amit Pareek,,,
"Doctor friendliness,",None,0,0,YES,"My wife had a cyst near her sinus which got complicated after couple of surgeries. It was Dental and ENT issue. We were referred to Mrs. Bindra by Dr. Ajay from Saivani hospital. Both of them performed surgery and now she is doing well. 

Post surgery got her Root canal treatment done here. I’m very happy with the treatment. Also, would like to thank Dr Punit, Swetha, Aparajitha and Krishna Priya for assisting in rootcanal treatment.

Especially, I would like to thank Mrs. Bindra(Sukhvinder Kaur) for guiding us throughout the process(Surgery and Root canal treatment). She treated us like a family. Thank you very much.

I would strongly recommend this to my family and friends. I’m very happy with the treatment done.",2019-06-09 07:28:00,False,True,Jagadish.M,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I am glad that i had a surgery under Dr. Bindra. She's like a friend rather than being a doctor. Her Innovative idea has saved me from getting marks on my face which would have appeared because of the surgery which i had to undergo. I consulted her for the Zygonatic Complex fracture and i would recommend her for any kind of dental or maxillofacial surgery / treatment. 

I would also like to mention her kindness and helping nature which reduces the pain of hefty bills that corporate hospitals charge these days. When ever i contacted her she responded without any excuse or haughtiness. Apart from her scope of work she also helped me to get treated from other doctors, which i guess was not her part of job. 
Thank you mam for the wonderful service and being a friend in the whole process of my treatment. Indeed we would be great friends in the days to come. ",2019-11-02 08:57:50,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
