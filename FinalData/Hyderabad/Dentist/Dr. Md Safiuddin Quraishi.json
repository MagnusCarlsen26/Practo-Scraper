Such was my case, I remember it was the day of Eid and I had throbbing pain in my tooth, with lockdown in place and a fear of contamination I was skeptical to go out for a  consultation. Using Practo, I searched for a dentist closer to my home and I found Dr. Safi there. \nWith uncertainty in my mind, I went ahead to get treatment. The moment you step in the clinic you will realize that you have come to the right place. It is a clean and a well maintained one. They practiced necessary sterilization protocols and from whatever I learnt in my education; I could see the sterilization practiced here. I was welcomed by Dr. Safi , who gave his appointments even on festival and looked into my case and suggested the treatment.\nI was aware that I had 2-3 issues with my teeth and he actually pointed all of them out in my first visit. He described my dental issues in detail and also informed me the step by step process on how he will be approaching in multiple sittings.\nI was amazed by his ********* *** *** patience to make me understand. He would even provide you multiple lines of treatment, which you can choose based on your pocket, he is not the one who would say the best ones are the expensive ones. \nI am writing this review after my complete treatment and I must say I am amazed and blessed that I could get this done on time and with a thorough professional, that he is. \nNow that you have read this review, you can understand that the time I took to pen this down shows my respect for the value of treatment provided. \nPlease proceed and get treatment for you and your closed ones.  \n",

Unfortunately I faced toothache in one of my teeth. \nBasically I am from Haryana but was here in Hyderabad for my office work.\nBelieve me I literally searched for two days to find the best dental clinic in Hyderabad. Lot of people suggested me to go to dental clinic chains but I was not satisfied from inside. One day I found a link on Quora about The Dental Room. And I searched it on Google. After reading some reviews I felt that let's give it a try and I called them immediately. \nAnd the point the lady starting talking showed a professionalism of the clinic. You know that you judge a thing from the first impression.\nAnyways I went to the clinic, talked with the Receptionist mam and finally to the doctor. \nRoohi Mam checked the issues thoroughly and gave me suggestions to go for root canal treatment. I heard that Root canal is painful treatment so I was very scared at that point. But after talking with mam I felt relaxed. \nFor some reasons I had to move out of City for two weeks but I fixed in my mind to get treated from here only. \nI came back to Hyderabad and got my treatment from the mastermind Dr. Safi. Both are very friendly and great human beings.\n\nAfter talking to him I felt unafraid.\nThe treatment went totally painless from injecting the local anaesthesia to the filling and cleaning. \nI cannot express in words they provided the service.\nThank you to the mam at the reception\n\nA lot of thanks to Dr Safi and specially Roohi Mam who gave the confidence and great treatment. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17\u263a\ufe0f\n",

Dr Safi advised to observe the tooth patiently for couple of months. While we wait, without any fruitful result of the baby teeth falling by itself for months and the new teeth at the risk of losing it's shape, doctor advised us to extract the baby teeth. I was bit concerned about the forceful extraction ( though needed as the young and old teeths are fighting for space from 6-months). The doctor made my son very comfortable about the process and I appreciate his style of dealing with kids + his perfection in his work. He removed the tooth without a single tear or scream coming out from my 8 year old and my son didn't hesitate for a revisit to dentist. This proves the kids comfort and co fidence in his doctor. Also, he provided us with lot of insights about the problem and how to care for teeth in d coming years. I appreciate his professionalism and service. The staff and the facility at the dental room is very nice. All in all, I had a nice and comfortable experience at the dental room.",

He will show the way and make you happy with his treatment.\n\nComing to my treatment part, I have my from 2 teeth bigger and I want to get those two big teeth shorter where it has to be resized. I just searched for many Dental hospitals. Finally found the Dental Room in Practo. I just read the reviews and visited the place for the first time. Later after meeting DR. Safi and shared my problem with him. He suggested me to go for the root canal treatment for the front 2 teeth and resized my teeth with zirconium crowns which is actually typical case in my problem. Because it\u2019s not easy thing to make a decision making your original teeth shorter by root canal and later replacing with perfect match teeth. He did it perfectly.  Trust me the confindence levels of DR.SAFI in the treatment what he is giving is Amazing. When he explained me the steps how he is going to deal my case I got confidence that he is right person I came down to.  He is definitely the best and Awesome doctor in our Hyderabad. And more passionate about his job and work which makes him out standing and unique. And even the treatment cost is offardable. hospitals *** ****** **** ** *** **** **** *** ******* *** ***** ******** *********** **.

The doctor listened to our needs very well, and explained in exact detail the course he was suggesting. The facilities were really clean, all COVID protocols were strictly followed. We were treated for a general checkup, cleaning + polishing and filling of a couple of cavities, very happy with the results. In the past, most of the dentists in our experience tried pushing toothpastes, brushes, floss and such - but here, the doctor encouraged us to buy his recommended stuff from Amazon or the local shop, so clearly he wasn\u2019t trying to push any random stuff. Really appreciate the professionalism, on top of the high quality of work done!",

I was bit concerned if her epilepsy could pose any risk if she ever needed to go for tooth implantation.On the other hand I was also planning to get her married.Today I am happy to write that  my sister has got her smile back .She is gaining confidence and beaming with positivity.A special thanks to your co-doctors and other staffs for putting hope in life",

I was much worried that an infection may have occured that would get out of hand. Then I visited  Dr. Safiuddin Qureshi at the Dental Room, Tokichowki with an intention to consult only first. \n\nI thank God for the way he put me at ease and I accepted it immediately when he suggested the tooth extraction. In an unbelievably painless 20-25 min procedure, he carefully removed the teeth. His fees was genuinely pocket friendly too.\n\nI left with a lot of respect for the Doctor and his clinic that day. I followed his advice at the follow up visit a week later and am doing fine. Time permitting I hope to visit the Dental room soon for some other dental health requirements. Highly recommended!",

Such was my case, I remember it was the day of Eid and I had throbbing pain in my tooth, with lockdown in place and a fear of contamination I was skeptical to go out for a  consultation. Using Practo, I searched for a dentist closer to my home and I found Dr. Safi there. \nWith uncertainty in my mind, I went ahead to get treatment. The moment you step in the clinic you will realize that you have come to the right place. It is a clean and a well maintained one. They practiced necessary sterilization protocols and from whatever I learnt in my education; I could see the sterilization practiced here. I was welcomed by Dr. Safi , who gave his appointments even on festival and looked into my case and suggested the treatment.\nI was aware that I had 2-3 issues with my teeth and he actually pointed all of them out in my first visit. He described my dental issues in detail and also informed me the step by step process on how he will be approaching in multiple sittings.\nI was amazed by his ********* *** *** patience to make me understand. He would even provide you multiple lines of treatment, which you can choose based on your pocket, he is not the one who would say the best ones are the expensive ones. \nI am writing this review after my complete treatment and I must say I am amazed and blessed that I could get this done on time and with a thorough professional, that he is. \nNow that you have read this review, you can understand that the time I took to pen this down shows my respect for the value of treatment provided. \nPlease proceed and get treatment for you and your closed ones.  \n",

Unfortunately I faced toothache in one of my teeth. \nBasically I am from Haryana but was here in Hyderabad for my office work.\nBelieve me I literally searched for two days to find the best dental clinic in Hyderabad. Lot of people suggested me to go to dental clinic chains but I was not satisfied from inside. One day I found a link on Quora about The Dental Room. And I searched it on Google. After reading some reviews I felt that let's give it a try and I called them immediately. \nAnd the point the lady starting talking showed a professionalism of the clinic. You know that you judge a thing from the first impression.\nAnyways I went to the clinic, talked with the Receptionist mam and finally to the doctor. \nRoohi Mam checked the issues thoroughly and gave me suggestions to go for root canal treatment. I heard that Root canal is painful treatment so I was very scared at that point. But after talking with mam I felt relaxed. \nFor some reasons I had to move out of City for two weeks but I fixed in my mind to get treated from here only. \nI came back to Hyderabad and got my treatment from the mastermind Dr. Safi. Both are very friendly and great human beings.\n\nAfter talking to him I felt unafraid.\nThe treatment went totally painless from injecting the local anaesthesia to the filling and cleaning. \nI cannot express in words they provided the service.\nThank you to the mam at the reception\n\nA lot of thanks to Dr Safi and specially Roohi Mam who gave the confidence and great treatment. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17\u263a\ufe0f\n",

Dr Safi advised to observe the tooth patiently for couple of months. While we wait, without any fruitful result of the baby teeth falling by itself for months and the new teeth at the risk of losing it's shape, doctor advised us to extract the baby teeth. I was bit concerned about the forceful extraction ( though needed as the young and old teeths are fighting for space from 6-months). The doctor made my son very comfortable about the process and I appreciate his style of dealing with kids + his perfection in his work. He removed the tooth without a single tear or scream coming out from my 8 year old and my son didn't hesitate for a revisit to dentist. This proves the kids comfort and co fidence in his doctor. Also, he provided us with lot of insights about the problem and how to care for teeth in d coming years. I appreciate his professionalism and service. The staff and the facility at the dental room is very nice. All in all, I had a nice and comfortable experience at the dental room.",

Where I recommend whoever have a problem with their tooth or how much critical it is. He will show the way and make you happy with his treatment.\n\nComing to my treatment part, I have my from 2 teeth bigger and I want to get those two big teeth shorter where it has to be resized. I just searched for many Dental hospitals. Finally found the Dental Room in Practo. I just read the reviews and visited the place for the first time. Later after meeting DR. Safi and shared my problem with him. He suggested me to go for the root canal treatment for the front 2 teeth and resized my teeth with zirconium crowns which is actually typical case in my problem. Because it\u2019s not easy thing to make a decision making your original teeth shorter by root canal and later replacing with perfect match teeth. He did it perfectly.  Trust me the confindence levels of DR.SAFI in the treatment what he is giving is Amazing. When he explained me the steps how he is going to deal my case I got confidence that he is right person I came down to.  He is definitely the best and Awesome doctor in our Hyderabad. And more passionate about his job and work which makes him out standing and unique. And even the treatment cost is offardable. hospitals *** ****** **** ** *** **** **** *** ******* *** ***** ******** *********** **.

The doctor listened to our needs very well, and explained in exact detail the course he was suggesting. The facilities were really clean, all COVID protocols were strictly followed. We were treated for a general checkup, cleaning + polishing and filling of a couple of cavities, very happy with the results. In the past, most of the dentists in our experience tried pushing toothpastes, brushes, floss and such - but here, the doctor encouraged us to buy his recommended stuff from Amazon or the local shop, so clearly he wasn\u2019t trying to push any random stuff. Really appreciate the professionalism, on top of the high quality of work done!",

I was bit concerned if her epilepsy could pose any risk if she ever needed to go for tooth implantation.On the other hand I was also planning to get her married.Today I am happy to write that  my sister has got her smile back .She is gaining confidence and beaming with positivity.A special thanks to your co-doctors and other staffs for putting hope in life",

I was much worried that an infection may have occured that would get out of hand. Then I visited  Dr. Safiuddin Qureshi at the Dental Room, Tokichowki with an intention to consult only first. \n\nI thank God for the way he put me at ease and I accepted it immediately when he suggested the tooth extraction. In an unbelievably painless 20-25 min procedure, he carefully removed the teeth. His fees was genuinely pocket friendly too.\n\nI left with a lot of respect for the Doctor and his clinic that day. I followed his advice at the follow up visit a week later and am doing fine. Time permitting I hope to visit the Dental room soon for some other dental health requirements. Highly recommended!",

I am really happy with the way they understood my problem and suggested the treatments that needs to be done. I got my RCT done by Dr Safi, it was great visiting the clinic. Charges are also nominal as compared to other doctors. I would definitely recommend the Dental Room to my friends and family.",

I somehow wasn't satisfied and did some research online. Found this clinic and read some awesome reviews about Dr. Safi Quraishi! Trust me, its an awesome experience to get treated by him everything about him online is so much true! Nice and caring Doctor with genius treatment plans. He recommended me to go for just 2 fillings and 1 root canal with crown and that solved my problem! Treatment was pain free, neat and clean. I would recommend this clinic to everyone looking for genuine treatments and no unnecessary stuff. Dont expect much discounts like any other comercial clinics today since the prices are very reasonable for the quality they are providing!!!",
