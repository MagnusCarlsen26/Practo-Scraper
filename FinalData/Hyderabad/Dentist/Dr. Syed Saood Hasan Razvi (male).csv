"Treatment satisfaction,",None,0,0,YES,"I am a diabetic aged 70 yrs and suffering from severe toothache and could not take even the soft food.  I visited one of the dental hospital for the treatment and after examining my tooth they advised me to get both lower and upper tooth removed and go with dentures. Further a full mouth X-ray was also taken and told that there is no infection and hence root canal treatment is not required.  They prescribed only pain killers for the pain!!
Being diabetic, I was apprehensive of the pain when the all the upper and lower tooth are removed and could not proceed further with their suggestion and decided to go for second opinion to find whether this is ""the only"" solution for my case.   While browsing the internet for the good dental surgeons, I came across Dr.Razvi and I went to his clinic and explained my problem and shown him the X-ray.
To my surprise, he told me that tooth need not be removed completely and still can go with denture for the lower part which has given me courage to go ahead for the treatment.
He is a clam, simple, soft spoken and concern for the patient and understands their apprehensions and explain the problem to the patient and his solutions which are very convincing.  He is a thorough professional and perfectionist with lot of patience.  He diagnosed my problem quickly and having convinced with the solution proposed, I agreed to start  the treatment immediately.  I got relieved from the pain from the very second day without any further medicines.
The clinic is very clean, peaceful and supporting staff are very cordial.  He has removed only the wisdom teeth which was vertically broken and I got crowns for 8 teeth (starting from the molar 4 on each side which would help me to byte and chew) and lower tooth got trimmed to the gum level and denture is prepared. 
Now I am very happy as my tooth problem got   solved and hope to live peacefully for some more years.
