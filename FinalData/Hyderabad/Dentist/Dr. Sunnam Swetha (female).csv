I thought surgical procedure is very long and painfull but it has taken only few minutes and without pain as well.\nComing to root canal I thought it will take 2\/3 seatings but it was completed in single seating.\nI highly recommend Dr. Swetha and Dr.Javed and I will suggest everyone to visit this clinic.",2021-04-28 09:08:49,False,True,bhanu teja,,,
None,"Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Initially I was very much concerned about surgical procedures. I used to avoid them at all costs if possible. Due to my neglecting and avoiding behaviour, my tooth pain had become worse. So I visited Asian dental clinic for my treatment. Dr Swetha had suggested tooth removal due to over destruction of my tooth. She explained the procedure before performing and made sure that I was calm and composed. Procedure was done very quickly and it was perfect with no pain and complications. I highly recommend her to everyone.
