X-ray is a very basic diagnostic tool. We cannot come to a diagnostic conclusion in a symptomatic wisdom tooth which already has a deep filling without an X-Ray. Sensitivity for more than a few seconds indicates irreversible pulpitis. We always look at a long term permanent solution. There is always a chance of secondary decay happening underneath the filling and the  only way to confirm it is an X-Ray.
We do not plan extensive treatments like indirect pulp capping or root canal or crown for wisdom teeth. So we suggested you to go for tooth removal as a cost effective long term permanent solution.
We only suggest the treatment options and don't enforce them on our patients. Regarding the money, we charged you only 500 rupees including the consultation charge and X-Ray amount. That also includes my expertise, time and qualification. 
Please understand that for a doctor with more than 22 years of experience and someone who has treated  more than 15,000 patients, this is a very basic amount.

We request you to get an expert opinion from any other well experienced genuine dentist.
Dr Ritika and also Dr Chaitanya Reddy, who is a senior dental surgeon with more than 20 years of experience explained the same thing to you  yesterday. It is impossible for patients to look into their own mouth and come to a diagnosis. Kindly get an expert opinion before you write a review ma’am.

Thank you for the feedback. It makes us better practitioners.

We saw you one year back and advised you to go for removal of both your lower wisdom teeth as they are impacted and posing a threat to ideal oral hygiene. Now when you saw us after a year and the situation has worsened. As advised by our senior doctor ,the impacted wisdom teeth are also causing harm to your other two essential molar teeth. You being very young in age, this is a matter of concern and we were really worried about the probable damage to other two teeth of yours that might be caused by your impacted wisdom teeth.
We will be very glad to serve you in future .Please call and book an appointment to have a seamless experience.",2019-09-26T11:46:37+0000,Dr. Chaitanya Kumar Reddy
