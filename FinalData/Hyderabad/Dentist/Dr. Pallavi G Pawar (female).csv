None,None,0,0,YES,"Wonderful experience with Senior Dental Surgeon Dr. Pallavi. She explained everything to me in a very clear manner at the start of my surgery. She is very cordial in nature and very soft spoken. Dr. Pallavi's expertise and a willingness to listen and discuss my questions helped me to nullify my doubts and fear regarding my surgery. Itâ€™s rare to find a senior surgeon like Dr. Pallavi with such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. Dr. Pallavi's Clinic - Sri Sai Dental Hospital is the to-go hospital for Dental care.

I highly recommend Dr. Pallavi for genuine dental care and treatment and becoming her patient!",2021-04-21 16:42:45,False,True,Mr. MANISH A.,,,
