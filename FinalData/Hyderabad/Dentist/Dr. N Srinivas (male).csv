 you have presented with a swelling on left cheek with pain and inability to open the mouth even for checking

also 
 to add it to this,  you gave history of self medication for pain earlier days 
when we asked for taking an x-ray OPG, that shows the cause and extent of the infection lesion, your father wanted some immediate pain relief measures and not X-ray, so we just prescribed antibiotics and analgesics which can provide immediate relief but treatment has to be started immediately
 please let us know if someone treated you without seeing an x-ray 
coming to commercial angle we didn’t start any treatment at all and then suggest that any as we didn’t come to a diagnosis first

"Doctor friendliness,","Ceramic Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I was made to wait for 2hours (1hr 50mins) for a treatment which lasted less than 10 mins. I had to wait not because there was crowd but because (I guess) I was an old orthodontic patient who went there to fix my fixed retainers. The receptionist kept sending patients inside who came after me, keeping me waiting.
PS: Selected ‘doctor friendliness’ only because I can’t submit without selecting anything otherwise I would’ve selected none:)",2021-10-02 09:48:08,False,True,Verified Patient,"Hi
Sorry for making you wait
Reason is not that you’re old patient but each doctor does specific specialist work and the one who needs to attend you had patients already in queue
Also we have 5 chairs and 5 doctors but sometimes on weekends we see sudden rush of patients
And we generally don’t give appointments and try to finish then and there itself most of the times
As you’ve been our orthodontic patient, you must ve beem aware of our clinic system and protocols 
Anyways, we re once again sorry for the inconvenience",2021-10-06T12:30:15+0000,Dr. N Srinivas
