Sorry for making you wait
Reason is not that you’re old patient but each doctor does specific specialist work and the one who needs to attend you had patients already in queue
Also we have 5 chairs and 5 doctors but sometimes on weekends we see sudden rush of patients
And we generally don’t give appointments and try to finish then and there itself most of the times
As you’ve been our orthodontic patient, you must ve beem aware of our clinic system and protocols
