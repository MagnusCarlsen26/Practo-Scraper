"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Sumeet is really professional. One of the most soft spoken and dedicated doctors I have come across.
Focuses on explaining the problem in detail and then suggests the available option for the patient to choose. His wife Dr. Anargha  is equally accommodating and professional with her approach.
