                "review_text": "Following testimonial for Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy includes details of how we interacted with him for my mother\u2019s treatment which I felt was necessary for me to convey the admiration for Dr. Reddy which I developed during the treatment and I hope this helps families like us to find the right care and treatment for their loved ones in time...\n\nWe came across Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy when looking for a Maxillofacial surgeon for a second opinion for my mother. We had consulted a local dentist at first who diagnosed ulcerations and prescribed a local application of an ointment. However, as the issue did not subside even after 3-4 weeks of continuous use of the medication, we decided to go for a second opinion. This is when we came across Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy. \nDr. Reddy was very courteous and patient with us in trying to get to know the history of the ailment, the symptoms my mother was experiencing and what we had been doing to address it. Dr. Reddy upon his examination of the issue suspected it to be a squamous cell carcinoma and advised we get a few tests done to be certain of the diagnosis. It turned out to be the same and Dr. Reddy did not squander time anymore and was very transparent in his conversations with us and made sure we understood the illness and the treatment process. Reassurance from the doctor that this is nothing to be worried about and that we came to him at the right time was really comforting, a relief to know it would all be fine after the treatment is complete. The treatment was a 2-stage process where the tumour would be removed by a surgical procedure first followed by a full round of radiotherapy. \n\nWe completed all hospital formalities to prepare for the surgery. Dr. Reddy was the surgeon and after the surgery was complete, he was very articulate in making us understand how the tumour and adjacent margins were successfully removed. Dr. Reddy also visited my mother in the hospital as part of the daily rounds to see how she was recovering and if there was a need to address any minor expected post-surgical issues. He was very supportive and positive in his consultations with my mother and this I feel played a major role as  this not only gave reassurance to my mother that all will be well, but also it gave us, the family, the mental strength we needed to remain positive in the situation and support my mother in her recovery. \nDr. Reddy forewarned us that radiotherapy (RT) is the more complex part of the treatment which would require my mother to be patient and brave at the same time. He was also very proactive in sharing some medical articles on the illness and the treatment so that we wouldn\u2019t rely on unverified online sources for the information and take unnecessary stress. The advice from Dr. Reddy helped my mother prepare mentally for the RT and it helped us, the family to prepare a plan as to how we would care for our mother during the treatment addressing any expected side-effects (darkening of the skin at the site, ulcerations in the mouth, loss of appetite, general weakness, etc.). Even during RT, Dr. Reddy advised us to visit him once a week for him to observe how my mother was responding to the treatment and if any medication would be required for the expected side-effects. There were times when my mother was experiencing pain due to ulcerations following RT and swallowing food became difficult. We informed Dr. Reddy about the symptoms immediately and he was kind enough to call us in his clinic the next day to examine the symptoms which shows he responds to urgency promptly, really does care for his patients and wouldn\u2019t try to avoid any follow-up visits his patients might seek. The due diligence and care for his patients displayed by Dr. Reddy was truly motivational and very refreshing to see for me personally. All in all, Dr. Reddy has ensured all his patients experience very high standards of care and treatment at his clinic and I, have no doubts absolutely in recommending Dr. Reddy to everyone who are reading this testimonial to make sure their loved ones get the skilled treatment and care under Dr. Reddy\u2019s supervision. \n\nTo the patients and their families: Though it is easy to overlook but it is very important that in cases like my mothers\u2019 it is very important for the patient and the family to be positive, motivated and show the courage required to conquer the illness. The treatment might be tough to endure but if you are able to remain positive, self-motivated, and courageous right through, you and your loved ones WILL emerge victorious from this. Just keep alive that zeal to live! and the courage to overcome all odds to spend many more years with your loved ones!\n\nTo Dr. Reddy: I have no words to say how grateful our family is to him for the care, patience and proactiveness he had shown during my mother\u2019s treatment. Thank you, Dr. Srinivas Reddy, hope this testimonial helps others find the right care and treatment for their loved ones.",

Srinivas Reddy  when looking for a oral surgeon for a second opening, I went to my regular dental clinic as I was having swollen gum and puss leaking from the back of my jaw teeth and upon examination and scans 1st doctor said it would need a surgery, didn't explain me what was the issue just said my wisdom tooth is very far  up in the jaw bone and its a major surgery  and  they had arranged a consultation with another oral surgeon who explained that its a cyst in my jaw bone which is causing the problem and I would need a surgery and It would cost some where about 2.2 lacs without insurance and if I my insurance is approved it would cost 1.2lacs. which has given me stress and sleepless nights they  looked online and found Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy and visited his clinic . He looked at my previous reports and explained me there is cyst and  its not major  problem but the surgery would come under major surgery as the location of wisdom tooth is very far and cant keep my open for so long and would be painful which cannot be operated under local anesthesia. I would need to go under General Anesthesia. Also explained there is a  nerve very close to the cyst which can impact my sensation on the lower left side lip and teeth. He explain there will be numbness which I would regain in time. He suggested to get another ct scan report  as the previous scan was not focused on the problem area then just my face. Once I got the scan report he explained to me what is impacted and what would be possible post surgery recovery  stages and things I would experience post surgery. After talking to him I felt little relaxed.  On 14th Sep my surgery was done in Omni hospital and it went much smoother and faster than I imagined in my head. I had asked him to remove my other wisdom tooth as well while under anesthesia the day before. which he did.  My other wisdom tooth also was little further up close to my sinus socket.  He checked up on me after surgery and the next day in the morning I was discharged from hospital after his examination. I had asked him to remover my other wisdom tooth as well while under anesthesia. which The only things I had to pay was major surgical profile tests to the diagnostic center. My insurance covered the rest.... Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy have been in touch and responded to all my questions, he has checked me twice since the surgery, I  would defiantly recommend him to any one  with their oral or dental surgeries he explains everything in detail and also lets you to know to be expected.

Upon my first engagement with Dr VS Reddy only I was very much impressed with the way he explained things in medicine and non-medicine terms. The most impressive part was the recommendation/suggestion to go for OPG (wide angle x-ray) so that he can get clear picture of nerves alignment around the jaw bone as the tooth was impacted one and was in horizontal position almost at the end of socket. He wanted to be careful with the nerves during surgery that that might lead to loss of sensory near lower lip. Looking at the OPG, Dr Reddy confirmed we are good to go for surgery and provided appointment. \nThe tooth removal process took around 30-35 minutes, local anesthesia, considering how deeply the tooth was engrossed and partially decayed so had to be taken out in pieces. I was then put under 1 hour observation, as I was oozing out little more than others, as per doctor. He kept checking my condition every 15 minutes. He assured I was in proper shape before leaving his clinic.\n\nI was prescribed pain killers for few days and also antiseptic mouthwash. I followed his exact instructions and never was in pain even after the anesthesia affect disappeared. I could hardly see any sign of swellings (was a minor one for 2 days hardly). I was then advised to take muscle relaxer tablets as I wasn't able to open my mouth wide. Post the medication, I was all set with 0% wisdom (as indicated by doctor on lighter note :) lol)\nI strongly recommend Dr VS Reddy for any kind of dental problems. I wish you all the best Sir. You got me out of my wisdom tooth surgery which I kept procrastinating for years. Keep doing the service with same commitment.\n\nThanks a lot to you and other jr doctor (don't know her name) and support staffs who were very accommodating as well.",

                "review_text": "Following testimonial for Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy includes details of how we interacted with him for my mother\u2019s treatment which I felt was necessary for me to convey the admiration for Dr. Reddy which I developed during the treatment and I hope this helps families like us to find the right care and treatment for their loved ones in time...\n\nWe came across Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy when looking for a Maxillofacial surgeon for a second opinion for my mother. We had consulted a local dentist at first who diagnosed ulcerations and prescribed a local application of an ointment. However, as the issue did not subside even after 3-4 weeks of continuous use of the medication, we decided to go for a second opinion. This is when we came across Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy. \nDr. Reddy was very courteous and patient with us in trying to get to know the history of the ailment, the symptoms my mother was experiencing and what we had been doing to address it. Dr. Reddy upon his examination of the issue suspected it to be a squamous cell carcinoma and advised we get a few tests done to be certain of the diagnosis. It turned out to be the same and Dr. Reddy did not squander time anymore and was very transparent in his conversations with us and made sure we understood the illness and the treatment process. Reassurance from the doctor that this is nothing to be worried about and that we came to him at the right time was really comforting, a relief to know it would all be fine after the treatment is complete. The treatment was a 2-stage process where the tumour would be removed by a surgical procedure first followed by a full round of radiotherapy. \n\nWe completed all hospital formalities to prepare for the surgery. Dr. Reddy was the surgeon and after the surgery was complete, he was very articulate in making us understand how the tumour and adjacent margins were successfully removed. Dr. Reddy also visited my mother in the hospital as part of the daily rounds to see how she was recovering and if there was a need to address any minor expected post-surgical issues. He was very supportive and positive in his consultations with my mother and this I feel played a major role as  this not only gave reassurance to my mother that all will be well, but also it gave us, the family, the mental strength we needed to remain positive in the situation and support my mother in her recovery. \nDr. Reddy forewarned us that radiotherapy (RT) is the more complex part of the treatment which would require my mother to be patient and brave at the same time. He was also very proactive in sharing some medical articles on the illness and the treatment so that we wouldn\u2019t rely on unverified online sources for the information and take unnecessary stress. The advice from Dr. Reddy helped my mother prepare mentally for the RT and it helped us, the family to prepare a plan as to how we would care for our mother during the treatment addressing any expected side-effects (darkening of the skin at the site, ulcerations in the mouth, loss of appetite, general weakness, etc.). Even during RT, Dr. Reddy advised us to visit him once a week for him to observe how my mother was responding to the treatment and if any medication would be required for the expected side-effects. There were times when my mother was experiencing pain due to ulcerations following RT and swallowing food became difficult. We informed Dr. Reddy about the symptoms immediately and he was kind enough to call us in his clinic the next day to examine the symptoms which shows he responds to urgency promptly, really does care for his patients and wouldn\u2019t try to avoid any follow-up visits his patients might seek. The due diligence and care for his patients displayed by Dr. Reddy was truly motivational and very refreshing to see for me personally. All in all, Dr. Reddy has ensured all his patients experience very high standards of care and treatment at his clinic and I, have no doubts absolutely in recommending Dr. Reddy to everyone who are reading this testimonial to make sure their loved ones get the skilled treatment and care under Dr. Reddy\u2019s supervision. \n\nTo the patients and their families: Though it is easy to overlook but it is very important that in cases like my mothers\u2019 it is very important for the patient and the family to be positive, motivated and show the courage required to conquer the illness. The treatment might be tough to endure but if you are able to remain positive, self-motivated, and courageous right through, you and your loved ones WILL emerge victorious from this. Just keep alive that zeal to live! and the courage to overcome all odds to spend many more years with your loved ones!\n\nTo Dr. Reddy: I have no words to say how grateful our family is to him for the care, patience and proactiveness he had shown during my mother\u2019s treatment. Thank you, Dr. Srinivas Reddy, hope this testimonial helps others find the right care and treatment for their loved ones.",

Srinivas Reddy  when looking for a oral surgeon for a second opening, I went to my regular dental clinic as I was having swollen gum and puss leaking from the back of my jaw teeth and upon examination and scans 1st doctor said it would need a surgery, didn't explain me what was the issue just said my wisdom tooth is very far  up in the jaw bone and its a major surgery  and  they had arranged a consultation with another oral surgeon who explained that its a cyst in my jaw bone which is causing the problem and I would need a surgery and It would cost some where about 2.2 lacs without insurance and if I my insurance is approved it would cost 1.2lacs. which has given me stress and sleepless nights they  looked online and found Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy and visited his clinic . He looked at my previous reports and explained me there is cyst and  its not major  problem but the surgery would come under major surgery as the location of wisdom tooth is very far and cant keep my open for so long and would be painful which cannot be operated under local anesthesia. I would need to go under General Anesthesia. Also explained there is a  nerve very close to the cyst which can impact my sensation on the lower left side lip and teeth. He explain there will be numbness which I would regain in time. He suggested to get another ct scan report  as the previous scan was not focused on the problem area then just my face. Once I got the scan report he explained to me what is impacted and what would be possible post surgery recovery  stages and things I would experience post surgery. After talking to him I felt little relaxed.  On 14th Sep my surgery was done in Omni hospital and it went much smoother and faster than I imagined in my head. I had asked him to remove my other wisdom tooth as well while under anesthesia the day before. which he did.  My other wisdom tooth also was little further up close to my sinus socket.  He checked up on me after surgery and the next day in the morning I was discharged from hospital after his examination. I had asked him to remover my other wisdom tooth as well while under anesthesia. which The only things I had to pay was major surgical profile tests to the diagnostic center. My insurance covered the rest.... Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy have been in touch and responded to all my questions, he has checked me twice since the surgery, I  would defiantly recommend him to any one  with their oral or dental surgeries he explains everything in detail and also lets you to know to be expected.

Suspecting tooth extraction, I planned to see Dental Surgeon. Upon my first engagement with Dr VS Reddy only I was very much impressed with the way he explained things in medicine and non-medicine terms. The most impressive part was the recommendation/suggestion to go for OPG (wide angle x-ray) so that he can get clear picture of nerves alignment around the jaw bone as the tooth was impacted one and was in horizontal position almost at the end of socket. He wanted to be careful with the nerves during surgery that that might lead to loss of sensory near lower lip. Looking at the OPG, Dr Reddy confirmed we are good to go for surgery and provided appointment. \nThe tooth removal process took around 30-35 minutes, local anesthesia, considering how deeply the tooth was engrossed and partially decayed so had to be taken out in pieces. I was then put under 1 hour observation, as I was oozing out little more than others, as per doctor. He kept checking my condition every 15 minutes. He assured I was in proper shape before leaving his clinic.\n\nI was prescribed pain killers for few days and also antiseptic mouthwash. I followed his exact instructions and never was in pain even after the anesthesia affect disappeared. I could hardly see any sign of swellings (was a minor one for 2 days hardly). I was then advised to take muscle relaxer tablets as I wasn't able to open my mouth wide. Post the medication, I was all set with 0% wisdom (as indicated by doctor on lighter note :) lol)\nI strongly recommend Dr VS Reddy for any kind of dental problems. I wish you all the best Sir. You got me out of my wisdom tooth surgery which I kept procrastinating for years. Keep doing the service with same commitment.\n\nThanks a lot to you and other jr doctor (don't know her name) and support staffs who were very accommodating as well.",

Also the upper wisdom tooth was growing outwards towards cheek. I'm new to Hyderabad and had limited time from work and this medical condition created a lot of stress for me, I visited many surgeons and was told to have it surgically removed. I was scared, tense and was not getting confident to proceed with any surgeon before I met Dr. V S Reddy.He is a pro and his way of dealing with the issue is  exceptionally good. He explained everything well and helped me prepare mentally for the treatment. My tooth removal involved a lot of jaw bone cutting/ drilling. And it took almost 40 mins to remove both tooth. The upper tooth was removed before I could knew it. However, I had no pain during the procedure. Post procedure, I did have the obvious pain but the medicines worked well. It took 7-10 days to completely recover. I would like to know the people reading this that once you find the right doctor and co-operate with them, this kind of surgery is not a nightmare. It worked for  me well. I would recommend Dr Reddy without any second thought.  Thank you sir for your support, post surgery check ins and being so patient with me.",

                "review_text": "My wife was suffering with OKC symptoms two years back and we visited multiple dental hospitals near chandanahar and jubilee hills areas. Those are well established and well known dental hospitals. They could not diagnose the problem completely and did surgery to remove cyst. Since they did not completely checked, there was another cyst found inside once the first surgery completed. Again another surgery was done within a month duration. But, within 6 months when pain reoccured, we visited them again, they told cyst growth happened again in same location and this time it is more deep and spread. They asked us to get ready for another surgery. While we were not having clue on how to go about it, by gods grace, some one from our community suggested us to meet Dr Srinivas garu @ SmileTime dental, Kukatpally. While we already visited multiple bigger dental hospitals already, so, we were not sure on that advice, but, we thought, we will get opinion from Dr Srinivas and took an appointment and visited. Dr Srinivas, has gone through our past and present reports and checked thoroughly and explained in detail about the procedure to be followed. In fact, the cyst was present at 4 locations inside and not just at 1 or 2 locations. We understood that Dr Srinivas got tremendous experience with these kind of surgeries and almost weekly three or four days he will be dealing with these OKC and other related surgeries. We were very happy and very much convinced after talking to doctor. Surgery happened successfully on Oct 2021. The surgery cost as well was very much optimized with the help of Dr.Srinivas. We were very happy with evey interaction that we had with the doctor, prior to surgery and post follow-up s that we had post the surgery. Now it is 8 months competed after the surgery, my wife is not having any symptoms and not having any problems. Any one having OKC and related issues, please visit Dr Srinivas at SmileTime dental, Kukatpally, we are sure, you will get the best treatment and you will be happy that you are at right place and getting the best and correct guidance and treatment. Thank you so much to Dr Srinivas garu. \n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

I went to Vijaya dental clinic and they advised me to go for wisdom tooth removel and they will call surgaon and get the tooth extracted. I inquired about experienced surgoan however they did had experience surgaon then i asked do they know exp surgaon and they suggested Dr Reddy name. Later i could find out few people who went Dr reddy clinic for treatment. I did  look at all the review on net for Dr Reddy and decided to go removel. \nI must say my wisdom tooth was removed within 10 mins and with no pain at all under local anaesthesia. Even  procedure was done beautifully and it did not pain afterword also. Removal site healed in week and i perfectly fine now.\nDrReddy ************* efficient experienced methodical surgaon who pays attention details care for his patients like anything and his hands have magic. I recommend him and request people to reach out to him for facial surgery.\n",

I wasn't satisfied with their explanation and did not feel confident enough to get surgery done by them.\n\nFinally I met Dr Srinivas Reddy who managed to infuse confidence in me to go for surgery with his explanation about the pros and cons of surgery and I decided to go for jaw corrective surgery.\n\nMy surgery was done by Dr Srinivas at Omni Hospital,  Kukatpally .

But the way Dr V S Reddy has treated me is commendable and I would always be thankful to him for this. The fear I had for dental treatment was long gone and I dint even realize when my critical dental problems were treated with so much ease. Thank you so much Dr V S Reddy and the staffs of smiletime dental and Maxillofacial hospital  for treating my dental problem so well.",

Absolutely no pain, no need for any pain killers. And as I use my teeth, it feels as if no procedures were ever done. Dr Srinivas has magical skills when he the instruments in his hand. \nThe costs are very reasonable. \nI would strongly recommend patients to Dr Srinivas for any Dental problems.

Every time I visited doctor he investigated and explained the issue in detail and made sure the solution was for my own good and not like my past experiences where doctors were more concerned on getting multiple treatment done when not even necessary. I had tooth pain and cavity in my upper right wisdom tooth and believe me after the extraction I was back to normal in less than 2 days. I had lost confidence of eating from my right jaw side due to years of pain and bad experiences in the past but the doctor suggested me to start trying everyday and now I am able to eat everything and anything from the right jaw side just after 10 days of extraction. Great attitude, expertise and his approach is just like a family doctor who you can trust completely and who doesn't believe patients are just a means of profit. ",

Primary treatment is taken at a local hospital in Mumbai, first aid given and got stitches on the chin. Coming back after a few days I found I couldn't open my mouth and pain on the left side of the jaw. I've consulted all the doctor's in Hyderabad about this treatment and heard different answers and found that I should undergo surgery. My parents are so scared about what they've said and the way the treatment is going to be. Lately, we've consulted Dr.V.S.Reddy and he explained that there is a fracture on the left subcondylar region of the mandible with lateral displacement.Two methods suggested one is surgery and the other one is closed reduction(olden days method) and we chose surgery. Dr.V.S.Reddy explained and assured that everything is going to be perfect even after the surgery.Surgery is done and It's been a year now and I don't face any issue with the surgery.I would definitely suggest Dr.V.S.Reddy, he is very patient, friendly and supportive.Thank's a lot for assuring us with much confidence and your service.",

Before visiting this location I spent too much money for worthless service with a famous Doctor who might be ranked under 10 in Twin cities but his service is too far to rank.  Coming to this SMILETIME DENTAL &MAXILLOFACIAL CENTRE, Dr. V S REDDY attracted me in my first visit with his friendly nature. Here I must appreciate him the  way he is explaining the issue what I got and how to fix it. Even a child can understand him. Since then I never felt that I'm going to a dentist rather I felt I am going to meet close friend who is a Doctor.

During this 2 yr journey, the patience of doctor was visible in the way he interacted with the children. May be that could be the reason, why I never had to force my son to visit the clinic. The treatment concluded this weekend and I am really satisfied with the way the child was dealt during the entire treatment. The ambience of the clinic is surely much much better than those I had visited earlier. ",
