Right from diagnosis to the completion of my treatment , they have just created a wow experience for me and my daughter

Dr Prasad is so easy with his craft. He puts you to ease at once and explains everything  with extreme clarity. He is relentless until his patient is 100% satisfied with the result . Kudos to his commitment to his profession . I will highly recommend him. 

Dr Pratyushas craft is like watching a genius at play. The way she connects with people , the care she shows towards patients, her ability to diagnose  and suggest the most accurate treatment for a patient- there is an absolute precision in the way she works. She is supremely patient and is so hardworking . God bless her for the person she is ! 

Their entire staff- is supremely efficient and work so well under both of their guidance. They are skilled , meticulous and put a patient at ease at once . Brilliant doctors and staff.
