"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant Fixing,Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I recently completed a lengthy dental treatment with Dr. JayRaj that took around two years and multiple sittings. Before deciding on Dr. JayRaj, I consulted with six other dentists, all of whom quoted significantly higher prices for the same procedure. Dr. JayRaj‚Äôs rates were much more reasonable, making quality dental care affordable.

Dr. JayRaj is incredibly friendly and always listens patiently to all our queries. He treats his patients like family, ensuring a comfortable and supportive environment throughout the treatment process. His meticulous attention to detail truly makes him a Mr. Perfectionist, ensuring that every aspect of the treatment is handled with the utmost care and precision.

Moreover, his focus on providing painless treatment made the entire experience much more bearable and stress-free.

I have no hesitation in recommending Dr. JayRaj 100%. His availability was never an issue, making it easy to schedule appointments that fit my busy life. If you're looking for a dedicated, professional, and affordable dentist, Dr. JayRaj is the one to choose.",2024-05-17 16:45:04,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
