Naturally, I was really apprehensive of how things would go. But Dr. Kranti explained the process to me very nicely and eased my fear. Treatment (which was done in multiple sittings) went just perfect and quick. He ensured the process is both pain and stress free. They have a process of rewarding the kid after each treatment, which excites my daughter for the next visit.Then comes the post treatment care, which was my responsibility and I was stressing on that too. To my surprise, there was no down time. My daughter was doing perfectly normal even after the anesthesia wore off. His team also keeps tabs on how things are the next day.

But let me make few things clear that we don‚Äôt jump into treatments right in the first appointment especially for very young children or somebody coming to the dentist for the first time in their life time. This makes the child open up and become familiar with us and the surroundings which will help them in undergoing the treatments in a better way.
Regarding the school timings, we treat almost 25-30 children in a day and it is literally impossible to accommodate everyone in the evening after 5 pm or in the weekends . So we try to accommodate older children above 6 (for whom we don‚Äôt want them to miss their classes) after the school hours and for very young children we would like to schedule them in the mornings when they are fresh and energetic which makes them go through the treatments in comfortable way.
