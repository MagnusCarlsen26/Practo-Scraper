"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Surgical Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"*** ** *** **** ******* ** *** ****** ********* ******************* **** ******* * ****** I had a painful gum swelling around an RCT site which started becoming quite bothersome and I was looking out for an experienced dentist /periodontist.

The whole procedure went smooth and almost pain free and recovery/healing was great. Why I would highly recommend Dr Vinay to anyone seeking dental help -
- Straightforward & clear in his approach & thinking
- Super quick in diagnostics and recommends the right line of treatment
- very friendly, reachable on phone, accessible/ approachable. You're in safe hands with him
- Careful & diligent during the procedure ensuring patient is kept informed and it goes smoothly

In my opinion, Dr. Vinay is a very kind, patient, and supportive doctor. He offers the best advice, explains the procedure, acts quickly, and works to relieve tooth discomfort. He doesn't leave you waiting in the course of the treatment for too long.

My teeth were shaking so badly. I suffered while eating and drinking too. After checking my teeth, he said one of my teeth is in bad condition and going for removal is the best. The other tooth which was shaking too, he said that it was minor and just painkillers will do fine. He was right! The extraction was painless and I'm happy with that. Great dentist who knows what to do.
