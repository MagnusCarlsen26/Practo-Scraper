Then I decided to take the treatment to fulfill the gaps by knowing that there is a short way to cure it instead of long process like clip treatment. I have gone through many hospitals over the websites and find \u201cThe Dental Specialists\u201d finally. I read the reviews, treatment and doctors in The Dental Specialists and came over here with lots of doubts in my mind how the treatment will turn out to be.\nBut the very first time I visited, I decided to not to go anywhere other than this hospital. The way they treated from the first minute of visit was awesome. They suggested me the different ways which helps to overcome my doubts. Doctors Roopa, Dr. Imran have treated me and suggested me the best options they have. Dr. Dua who has followed up with me right from the beginning, it felt extremely special and important as a patient. And finally Dr. Venkat Garu, head of the institution also came, discussed and assured me to not to worry. Then my treatment started with grafting because my gums and cavities have infected. After successful completion of my grafting and I personally felt the change and got the complete belief on their work. Later on Dr Imran Garu took the responsibility about my ortho which helps to fill the gaps between the teeth. \nHe took the seperate and personal care on me because my cavities are so week to respond as early as possible. It takes a little longer but finally done to satisfy my dream to smile....And then to put on the crowns Dr Kamal Garu has taken the responsibility about the crowns and he explained everything with out leaving no stone unturned in my mind.\nAll the Doctors and Staff have worked really well for my treatment.Thanks to all the people and Doctors at The Dental Specialists especially Dr. Imran, Dr Dua, Dr Kamal and Dr Venkat garu personally. And I decided to ask my sister to visit The Dental Specialists next week as she wants to take the ortho.",

Then I decided to take the treatment to fulfill the gaps by knowing that there is a short way to cure it instead of long process like clip treatment. I have gone through many hospitals over the websites and find \u201cThe Dental Specialists\u201d finally. I read the reviews, treatment and doctors in The Dental Specialists and came over here with lots of doubts in my mind how the treatment will turn out to be.\nBut the very first time I visited, I decided to not to go anywhere other than this hospital. The way they treated from the first minute of visit was awesome. They suggested me the different ways which helps to overcome my doubts. Doctors Roopa, Dr. Imran have treated me and suggested me the best options they have. Dr. Dua who has followed up with me right from the beginning, it felt extremely special and important as a patient. And finally Dr. Venkat Garu, head of the institution also came, discussed and assured me to not to worry. Then my treatment started with grafting because my gums and cavities have infected. After successful completion of my grafting and I personally felt the change and got the complete belief on their work. Later on Dr Imran Garu took the responsibility about my ortho which helps to fill the gaps between the teeth. \nHe took the seperate and personal care on me because my cavities are so week to respond as early as possible. It takes a little longer but finally done to satisfy my dream to smile....And then to put on the crowns Dr Kamal Garu has taken the responsibility about the crowns and he explained everything with out leaving no stone unturned in my mind.\nAll the Doctors and Staff have worked really well for my treatment.Thanks to all the people and Doctors at The Dental Specialists especially Dr. Imran, Dr Dua, Dr Kamal and Dr Venkat garu personally. And I decided to ask my sister to visit The Dental Specialists next week as she wants to take the ortho.",
