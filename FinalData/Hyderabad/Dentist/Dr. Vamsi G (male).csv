"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Artificial Teeth,",0,0,YES,"I am very much pleased to share my thoughts on Dr.Vamsi's superspeciality Dental Hospital, Defence colony,Sainikpuri Secundrabad. Probably this experience of mine will help in allaying doubts in the minds of patients those who are visiting this hospital for the first time. 
Firstly I am indebted to Dr.Vamsi who took up my case  after I faced Rejections in many clinics and  hospitals .The feedback I got from many of them was that, the damage cannot be restored or it will be too costly with minimal guarantee about the success of the treatment.  I visited Dr.Vamsi with all the negative thoughts in my mind  and probably another rejection .
However he explained me the exact problem and assured me that correction  is possible. As I  was skeptical  and wanted to reach a comfort level where I could analyze all the  feedbacks I received and take an informed decision. He was very supportive and called me for discussion many times just to shore up my confidence and remove all the negativities  that engulfed me and  pushed me into a shell. 
Finally I  agreed to go for the treatment based on his assurance. His positivity, confidence about the line of treatment and professionalism made me get my smile back.
About the hospital,the  ambience and professionalism are all on spot.I  would recommend this hospital for any type of dental treatments. The staff were very courteous and supportive.
Thank a lot Dr.Vamsi
