None,"Knee replacement,",0,0,YES,"Writing a review for this doctor is very difficult to be expressed in words but still i would share my story here with this doctor.I got to know about this doctor from one of my family doctor in Kolkata.So as i was not in Hyderabad i mailed this doctor about my mom's right knee pain with her previous medical prescriptions and x-rays. After he saw that mail we had a telecommunications and i got confidence on this doctor and book a flight to hyderabad from Kolkata with my parents. After examining my Mom thoroughly and doing some tests he suggested total knee replacement for my Mom, but we got very scared as per some other relatives comments who had done their surgery somewhere else and operation was not successful. When i shared their story with this doctor he directly sent me to a patient whome he had just operated 2 weeks back and came to hospital on that day for stitch removal. So we went to that gentleman and took his very good reviews on the operation done by this doctor and he was also able to move and bend his leg for a full flexion just after 2 weeks of his both knee replacement done. The doctor also sent us to a patient in ot recovery room who was walking first time just after 4 hours  of his knee t replacement done.After seeing all this we got confidence and went for a total knee replacement surgery for my Mom s right knee. After the operation doctor made her walk just after 4 hours of her surgery and from next day her Physiotherapy got started in the hospital. The highest pain for my Mom after the surgery was 3 out of 10, that too after doing Physiotherapy ,which was quite less for her rather than previous knee pain.

Now it has been 2 weeks and my mom is now walking without any Walker support. She also went upstairs just at the second day of her operation. Now her painkiller is also just paracetamol and no heavy painkiller is prescribed to her still she won't be complaining about any pain to me even after her Physiotherapy.

It is actually my mom's words to every person who is having a knee pain and need a knee replacement but not doing so by thinking that it may get failed and tolerating this pain they all should go to this doctor and made this operation done by him if needed.

In a word i can tell this doctor is the most transparent, responsive, helpful , friendly person in this earth i have ever met as a doctor.*** ***** *** ***** ******* *** ** * **** **** ** ** ********* ** *** *** *** ****** ** *****",2017-02-07 10:04:53,False,True,Bidisha,,,

But it pains me to see your comment about not listening--I try to spend best of my time educating the patient about their diagnosis and make them involved. After having 19 plus years Orthopaedic experience and 10 years of working in the UK, I believe in appropriately assessing the patient and investigating them. It is in your favour. If you still feel that you didn't get appropriate management , you can have free consultation again.",2016-03-29T15:22:05+0000,Dr. Sunil Dachepalli
