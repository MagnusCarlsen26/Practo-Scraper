He calmly assessed my habits and routines and made me understand what was the cause and consequences of my injury. Not only that he made me understand the treatment to it and alternatives as well. After looking at initial reports he also explained how we can go about treating my ankle depending on the level of damage there is. Having a clear idea about your situation and proper assessment of damage helps the patient react to it better I guess. Thankful for proper insight from the doctor.",

He calmly assessed my habits and routines and made me understand what was the cause and consequences of my injury. Not only that he made me understand the treatment to it and alternatives as well. After looking at initial reports he also explained how we can go about treating my ankle depending on the level of damage there is. Having a clear idea about your situation and proper assessment of damage helps the patient react to it better I guess. Thankful for proper insight from the doctor.",
