"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",None,0,0,YES,"Overall cool experience. Doctor is ready to listen the problem and explain in detail. I would recommend this Doctor for all type of  Ortho problems(joint pains, knee pain, back pain etc.,). I visited numbers of  Doctor's and  had BAD  experience. This Doctor is very very good and nice. At the time of treatment I am unable to move and walk, after using medicines he has prescribed to me  I  come out of all my pains   within 5 days and now I am 100% fit and walking 
 and climbing steps easily without anybody's support. 
Thanks Doctor,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee replacement,",0,0,YES,Doctor Suresh Babu is an extremely calm and patient doctor. My mother in law's knee replacement surgery was done in Kim's by him and it was a wonderful experience. He is always reachable on his mobile and he promptly responds to calls/SMS and whatsapp..so the post surgery period was easy to sail through. Recently my daughter fractured her hand and he treated..he gave us a lot if assurance and helped thru the whole process of insurance and asked his team to help when he was not around when we went to the emergency after the accident . Overall I would recommend this doctor to my friends and family.,2018-03-30 06:53:09,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
