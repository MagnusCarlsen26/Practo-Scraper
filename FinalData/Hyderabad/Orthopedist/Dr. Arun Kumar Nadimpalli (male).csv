"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Arthroscopic Acl Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"Hi , I want to share my story , I fell in the bathroom. A year later, I had severe pain in my right knee and was having trouble walking. I met Dr. Arun, who recommended that I undergo an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy on my right knee. At the time, I was very nervous and afraid of the procedure, but he gave me a lot of confidence and assured me that I would be able to walk properly and pain-free. My family and I trusted him, and we carried out the operation, and now, after two years, I'm fit and well. He is the best surgeon; the way he treats me makes me feel fearless and confident. His team also takes great care of me. Thanks a lot Sir.",2024-07-31 03:28:23,False,True,A Agrawal,,,
