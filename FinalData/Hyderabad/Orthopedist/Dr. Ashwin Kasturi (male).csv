I welcome your valuable feedback , I will try my best to keep up with time ......sometimes I need to attend casualty/emergency calls which would delay the regular appointments or..... some times I need to spend more time with few patients in better understanding of their problem & guiding them the treatment.........sometimes the  problem which I noticed is name in the appointment and name in the op registration  are different , here the appointment is likely to be thought as patient not yet come.


 All the appointments booked will be displayed in my tab/mobile, we will match the names in the appointments and the patient registered for consultation, will see  accordingly.

the last mentioned  reason is not the reason for this appointment  delay. I take this review an opportunity   in communicating  with the rest of the patients to book the appointments in the name of the patients, few patients had this problem earlier.

Found out the root cause and started treatment accordingly, now I'm doing reasonably well and expecting to get even better in due course of treatment.
