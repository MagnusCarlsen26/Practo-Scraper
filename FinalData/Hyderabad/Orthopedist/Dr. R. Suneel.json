First of all he got out all the information and then suggested for the surgery and he is actually good at explaining clearly like what is happening, what all complications are there he was very much clear about the treatment, and it gave me full resonate to know about the problem my dad was facing. I usually visit other hospitals. It's been his first visit to him. Wait time can be improved in the hospital and am not happy with the experience of operation people in hospital most of people they don\u2019t care about the patient and don't treat normally it happens all the times, when we visit they will tell doctor is not available you have to wait for 2hours there is not visibility when he is coming, all the time you ask about the doctor they will tell doctor is in operation so am not really happy with the hospital operations *** *** ********* *** **** ****** *** **** ***** I am happy to meet Dr. Suneel in Medicover Hospitals.",

I usually visit other hospitals. It's been his first visit to him. Wait time can be improved in the hospital and am not happy with the experience of operation people in hospital most of people they don\u2019t care about the patient and don't treat normally it happens all the times, when we visit they will tell doctor is not available you have to wait for 2hours there is not visibility when he is coming, all the time you ask about the doctor they will tell doctor is in operation so am not really happy with the hospital operations *** *** ********* *** **** ****** *** **** ***** I am happy to meet Dr. Suneel in Medicover Hospitals.",

It was a random search on practo based on reviews we visited him. I am happy with the medicines he suggested. I will recommend the doctor to my family and friends. The wait time was a little bit too much. We had to wait for 20-25min and I think the existing patient took a lot of time. He did give time for the consultation and also makes patients comfortable to talk openly.",
