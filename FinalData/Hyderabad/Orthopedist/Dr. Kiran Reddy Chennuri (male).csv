I traveled all the way from the US to undergo surgery for my ACL tear, as I had a limited time frame for recovery during my one-month leave. From the moment I stepped into Kindle, I knew I was in good hands. 

Dr. Kiran Reddy and his team recommended using my own hamstring graft for the surgery, which I felt was a personalized approach to my treatment. The surgery was successful, and I was impressed by the level of care provided by the entire medical staff.

The post-operative physiotherapy and rehabilitation program offered by Kindle were instrumental in my recovery. While it was initially challenging, the physiotherapy team was highly skilled, encouraging, and motivating. They helped me regain strength, flexibility, and stability in my knee. 

Within just one week after surgery, I started seeing significant improvements. The pain reduced, and I regained confidence in my knee's functionality. The dedication and expertise of the physiotherapy team played a crucial role in my successful recovery.

I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Kiran Reddy and the entire team at Kindle for their excellent care and support throughout my journey. Thanks to their efforts, I am now able to return to my workouts with confidence, knowing that I have received top-notch treatment and care.

I highly recommend Dr. Kiran Reddy Chennuri and Kindle Hospital to anyone in need of orthopedic care. Their expertise, personalized approach, and commitment to patient well-being truly set them apart.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Knee Pain Treatment,Hip Pain Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I have visited Dr kiran Reddy as one of my friends recommended him as a good knee specialist. I have been having knee pain since 6 months on and off, and have consulted a lot of orthopedics who have prescribed various pain medications, blood tests and MRI scans, I have also been offered a diagnostic laproscopy procedure for finding out what was wrong with my knee. Every time I took medications the pain went away for a few days but it returned as soon I went on with life. I have lost faith in doctors and wanted to try alternative medicine like homeopathy.

After I visited Dr Kiran Reddy, he patiently listened to all my problems and took a very detailed history of events from the beginning and including my childhood to correlate any similar events. He meticulously went through all my previous prescriptions,blood reports, x_rays and scans. He did a full body examination including my spine, foot other joints to omit all the conditions others might have missed. 

He found out that I had some issue with the hip on the same side as the movements were less and the hip was tight with little pain. Apparently the new hip x_rays showed some fluid in the joint causing it to move apart. He has nailed the problem with another MRI scan of the hip. It was pain from the hip which was showing as knee pain. The explanation finally did make some meaning to me.

Although the entire consultation took over 40 minutes to go through my old reports and scans, He also called up the concerned radiologist to discuss my MRI report. While he had patients to attend to, he gave me full attention I needed because I was running around hospitals from pillar to post till then. 

He gave me options for the treatment, and explained in detail their advantages and disadvantages. He also suggested that for my stage I should be fine with non surgical treatment along with some changes in my daily routine and lifestyle. 

I am doing fine now. I thank the doctor for his help and support.

My mother had been suffering from severe back pain for several years, and despite seeking medical help from various doctors and undergoing numerous tests, her condition only seemed to worsen with time. We were afraid that surgery might be the only option left to alleviate her pain.

Dr. Chennuri took a holistic approach to my mother's treatment, combining physiotherapy with medication and other non-invasive techniques to address the root cause of her pain. He was patient, attentive, and always willing to answer our questions and concerns.

Thanks to Dr. Chennuri's diligent efforts, my mother's back pain has significantly reduced, and she is finally able to sleep on her right side again, something she hasn't been able to do for many years. She is now living a pain-free life, and we cannot express our gratitude enough.

Now, coming to Kindle Clinics, 
They have good parking space for both cars and bikes.
Lift is a BIG issue. So, if you come with a serious injury, no stretcher is available. Lift can accommodate only 2-3 people at max.
Clinic has decent facilities with in-house X-Ray and physio room.

Major issue is attitude of staff. They don't care about you at all.
Even if you are talking to them and asking more details, they would simply  ignore and keep on discussing among them.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My son fractured his finger the previous night. We took the first available appointment next morning via call and reached on time to the clinic. 

The whole process was extremely expedited, it just took us 20 minutes for the entire visit. From the moment we entered the clinic to seeing the doctor, getting the x ray done,  applying a splint and leaving. The entire process was so streamlined that we could rarely see in big corporate hospitals. There was no fuss, no running around billing counters, nothing intimidating. It has a nice homely feel to it, I really wish the concept of neighbourhood clinics could come back.

The doctor was very forthcoming about the fracture and the course of recovery. He said, just rest and immobilisation alone should heal the fracture and no further surgery or medication is required. I wish kindle clinics and the doctors practicing there the very best and totally recommend it to who ever is looking for their medical needs in Gachibowli and Kokapet area.

The procedure was a little painful , but Dr. Kiran did it with utmost care and was very skilful and professional.

The doctor has also charted out and gave a detailed rehabilitation program and told me what to expect and how to go about it. Most surprising thing is the physiotherapy was also directly coordinated and supervised by dr kiran reddy himself. 

He is quite approachable and has always responded to my issues even if they were small ones. 

I highly recommend him for any knee related problems. 

Thank you

Thank you for taking the time to review. Let us methodically explain each of your concerns.

(1) We use state of the art Allengers High frequency and low radiation x-ray machines for the best clarity least radiation dosage, and the cost of the x-ray is on par with any other centre and definitely cheaper than all the corporate hospitals.

(2) All the blood and imaging diagnostics are processed from the clinic via well accredited and reliable labs for pinpoint accuracy and the patient`s convenience so that they don't have to run from pillar to post.

(3) And because of that, we were able to nail the diagnosis rather than shoot in the dark without any guesswork involved.

(4) We do not deploy a plaster of Paris cast for the above-mentioned condition; instead, we use a lightweight synthetic cast for optimal strength and patient comfort.

All in all, we are glad to know that you have found another doctor who could help you with this. If you need any knowledge transfer, assistance or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. 

Glad to be of service.

Thank you.

Regarding the cost of the X-rays, it is important to note that your mother required them for both knees and her entire spine, which is why the cost was incurred. This is a standard procedure and is typically less expensive than at other hospitals or diagnostic centres.
_________________________________________________________________________


As a responsible doctor, I believe in treating the root cause of a patient's illness rather than just prescribing painkillers and sending them on their way. In the case of your mother, as she had a very early hysterectomy at the age of 23 I advised her to undergo bone density and other tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.
_________________________________________________________________________
I also want to clarify that we do encourage our patients to obtain medical tests from outside diagnostic centres as long as they are accredited by national and international board standards. 
_______________________________________________________________________
We review reports from outside facilities and have tie-ups with accredited labs. If there is any discrepancy or inaccuracy in the report, we can repeat the sample for free that is the commitment we have to our patients. We can't bear the burden of inaccurate testing and inevitably delaying the diagnosis and treatment of our patients.
_________________________________________________________________________
With all due respect, If you have any further concerns or questions about the technology we use or our approach to patient care, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are always available to elaborate and address any concerns you may have.

Regarding the X-ray, it is important to note that CT scans involve significantly higher radiation exposure and are not always necessary for diagnosing certain conditions.

I am sorry, were you expecting me to cure a long-standing degenerative disease of the knee in one go by just looking at her? That's not how modern medicine works, it is all evidence-based and backed by research. I don't start with major diagnostic tests and procedures in the beginning without substantial proof of the condition. I start with simple medications first and advise lifestyle modifications, only if they don't work then some more investigations and tests are asked for and only then an intervention such as surgery is advocated. 

I wish you were accompanying the patient so that you could understand what I was trying to explain to her and advise her. I wish you accompanied her at least the second time rather than writing an unjustified review from the comfort of your couch. If it is an instant quick fix you are looking for your ailing mother in law I suggest you stop visiting a hospital.

Thank you for taking the time and writing your feedback. I totally appreciate it. Feedbacks like these do help a lot to keep reality in check. Only thing I really hope this feedback was not a way to vent out your frustration in life and defame someone just for the pleasure of it.
