I traveled all the way from the US to undergo surgery for my ACL tear, as I had a limited time frame for recovery during my one-month leave. From the moment I stepped into Kindle, I knew I was in good hands. 

Dr. Kiran Reddy and his team recommended using my own hamstring graft for the surgery, which I felt was a personalized approach to my treatment. The surgery was successful, and I was impressed by the level of care provided by the entire medical staff.

The post-operative physiotherapy and rehabilitation program offered by Kindle were instrumental in my recovery. While it was initially challenging, the physiotherapy team was highly skilled, encouraging, and motivating. They helped me regain strength, flexibility, and stability in my knee. 

Within just one week after surgery, I started seeing significant improvements. The pain reduced, and I regained confidence in my knee's functionality. The dedication and expertise of the physiotherapy team played a crucial role in my successful recovery.

I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Kiran Reddy and the entire team at Kindle for their excellent care and support throughout my journey. Thanks to their efforts, I am now able to return to my workouts with confidence, knowing that I have received top-notch treatment and care.

I highly recommend Dr. Kiran Reddy Chennuri and Kindle Hospital to anyone in need of orthopedic care. Their expertise, personalized approach, and commitment to patient well-being truly set them apart.

Thank you once again, Dr. Kiran Reddy, and the entire team at Kindle, for helping me make a full recovery and regain my active lifestyle.

Now, coming to Kindle Clinics, 
They have good parking space for both cars and bikes.
Lift is a BIG issue. So, if you come with a serious injury, no stretcher is available. Lift can accommodate only 2-3 people at max.
Clinic has decent facilities with in-house X-Ray and physio room.

Major issue is attitude of staff. They don't care about you at all.
Even if you are talking to them and asking more details, they would simply  ignore and keep on discussing among them.
Very unprofessional staff.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"My son fractured his finger the previous night. We took the first available appointment next morning via call and reached on time to the clinic. 

The whole process was extremely expedited, it just took us 20 minutes for the entire visit. From the moment we entered the clinic to seeing the doctor, getting the x ray done,  applying a splint and leaving. The entire process was so streamlined that we could rarely see in big corporate hospitals. There was no fuss, no running around billing counters, nothing intimidating. It has a nice homely feel to it, I really wish the concept of neighbourhood clinics could come back.

The doctor was very forthcoming about the fracture and the course of recovery. He said, just rest and immobilisation alone should heal the fracture and no further surgery or medication is required. I wish kindle clinics and the doctors practicing there the very best and totally recommend it to who ever is looking for their medical needs in Gachibowli and Kokapet area.

I had a 5th metarpal fracture on 1 Mar 2022 and had K- Wire cross fixation done on 2 Mar 2022 in AIG Hospital with a Different Orthopaedic Surgeon. As it is really difficult to catch the doctor who has done the surgery, I have decided to consult Dr Kiran Reddy at Kindle Clinics by reading very good reviews in practo.  Dr. Kiran diagnosed the root cause for the pain by prescribing few x-ray samples and few blood tests. He informed that I have a muscle loss in certain parts of the hand and due to the pop plaster the had got jammed with the lack of mobility. Also, he informed that i have a de quervain's tenosynovitis near right thumb. He suggested non invasive rigorous physiotherapy for 7 days and few medications and today i have completed the physiotherapy and the wrist and hand mobility improved a lot.  I liked the doctor way of diagnosis, identifying the root cause, patience, his non invasive methods, suggests only required treatments and avoids unnecessary panicking the patients etc. I would like to recommend the doctor for every one who are suffering with any orthopaedic disorders. Definitely you can trust the practo reviews regarding this doctor. ",2022-05-13 06:25:31,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

Initially, I had a lot of apprehensions regarding the surgery as I spoke to some other people who had it done previously, it was nothing like that. The doctor had provided great clarity and explained in detail what I would go thru in each phase of recovery and it has been extremely helpful. He puts a lot of emphasis on physiotherapy and rehabilitation and made sure I stick to the regimen. I thank the staff at Kindle clinics and the anesthesiologist and nursing staff at Sunshine hospital for taking such good care and lastly, I would like to immensely thank the physiotherapist for taking great care and being very patient with my recovery.

Thank you for taking the time to review. Let us methodically explain each of your concerns.

(1) We use state of the art Allengers High frequency and low radiation x-ray machines for the best clarity least radiation dosage, and the cost of the x-ray is on par with any other centre and definitely cheaper than all the corporate hospitals.

(2) All the blood and imaging diagnostics are processed from the clinic via well accredited and reliable labs for pinpoint accuracy and the patient`s convenience so that they don't have to run from pillar to post.

(3) And because of that, we were able to nail the diagnosis rather than shoot in the dark without any guesswork involved.

(4) We do not deploy a plaster of Paris cast for the above-mentioned condition; instead, we use a lightweight synthetic cast for optimal strength and patient comfort.

All in all, we are glad to know that you have found another doctor who could help you with this. If you need any knowledge transfer, assistance or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. 

Glad to be of service.

Thank you.

This is a standard practice in healthcare and helps us provide efficient and effective care to our patients, ensuring continuity of care even if physical files are lost. Using cutting-edge technology to provide quality patient care is not a crime or negligence, but rather a way to enhance the level of care we can provide. In fact, I also use an Apple iPad to show 3D human anatomy in an interactive way, which many patients appreciate.

Regarding the cost of the X-rays, it is important to note that your mother required them for both knees and her entire spine, which is why the cost was incurred. This is a standard procedure and is typically less expensive than at other hospitals or diagnostic centres.
_________________________________________________________________________


As a responsible doctor, I believe in treating the root cause of a patient's illness rather than just prescribing painkillers and sending them on their way. In the case of your mother, as she had a very early hysterectomy at the age of 23 I advised her to undergo bone density and other tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.
_________________________________________________________________________
I also want to clarify that we do encourage our patients to obtain medical tests from outside diagnostic centres as long as they are accredited by national and international board standards. 
_______________________________________________________________________
We review reports from outside facilities and have tie-ups with accredited labs. If there is any discrepancy or inaccuracy in the report, we can repeat the sample for free that is the commitment we have to our patients. We can't bear the burden of inaccurate testing and inevitably delaying the diagnosis and treatment of our patients.
_________________________________________________________________________
With all due respect, If you have any further concerns or questions about the technology we use or our approach to patient care, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are always available to elaborate and address any concerns you may have.

I would like to clarify that no doctor would prescribe five types of painkillers ever, it is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful to the patient's health.

It is important to note that pain management involves a comprehensive approach, including medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. The other medications prescribed were aimed at reducing inflammation and promoting the healing of the ligaments.
