One of the finest and well experienced dr i have ever seen is Mr Mir Jawad Zar Khan. 
This was my 8th surgery, in Germanten Hospital I have undergone with Total Hip Replacement surgery. 

Due to road accident previously I had 7 surgeries in different hospitals all are failed due to carelessness from hospital or from dr, operation didn't go well i was unable to walk properly and cant ride bike as well as cant sit on back seat of the bike for long period of time. 

One of my friend suggested Germanten Hospital attapur, I consulted in hospital and my surgery went well now I am able to walk without pain after 6 years ans 8 surgeries.

So please don't make mistakes like me to chose the Doctor as well as hospital. 

For any treatment you should have a better hospital as well as a good and experienced doctor.

Dear sir,
We have already informed you on phone and preponed your appointment from 8.30pm to 7.30pm as u have already told ,since we had a  emergency surgery at 8.30pm.
Also Our Senior Dr has attended by 30minutes which Practo Prime minimum waiting time.
We never allow 2patients in one room we honor patients privacy.
We are a 100beds Orthopedic Institute and have multiple OP consultation rooms and along with Dr.Khan there are other Orthopedic Assistant Doctors who attend to Patients .
All detail explanation of patients condition i.e cervical spondylosis and knee osteoarthritis  in your case was done on laptop and different treatment options and even exercises was explained and demonstrated .

We are sorry for the disturbance you have encountered in OP due to some emergency patient which the staff has to bring.
Please also note sir that no doctor can refuse to see a emergency patient while attending a regular outpatient patient .
Since it occured when u visited u might have experienced unpleasant situation for which we are very extremely sorry.

Our Senior Dr has 20yrs orthopedic experience and Many Pts come from Far to show him due to the Trust in him rather than the Awards.
For Xray diagnosis 5mins is more than enough for senior Dr like him to know the pts problem
And detail explanation is told to pt about the condition and the best possible treatment according to pts age and condition.
In your case sir,Dr.Khan offered the best treatment possible that is visscosuplementation for knee osteoarthrtis,since it is very safe and effective therapy and pain killers can be avoided which cause kidney damage.we dont offer stem cells at that age as they dont have any effect as some other commercial hospitals do,we want to keep faith and trust of out pts.

More than any marketing in medical field atleast it is how patients get treated maters .
Many patients come from faroff places also to us since we have a excellent track record of success in treating many orthopedic conditions.
Many complicated surgeries have been done successful in our institute by our senior doctors at very economical price.
Please see our reviews in other online resources like google.
Please dont be hasty in judging any organisation by just a few minutes visit.


We always strive in every aspect to improve our services and always take any form of feedback as instrument to improve our services
