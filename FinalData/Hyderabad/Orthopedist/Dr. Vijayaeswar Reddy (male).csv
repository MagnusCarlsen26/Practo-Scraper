I visited his clinic for my mom hand pain. That pain has come due to fall on the grass land. He said about fracture and asked operation of cost around ₹50,000 or plaster. I opted plaster. 
The way he did plaster,i don't think that he has done it in good way. Because after removing plaster, pain has started other places too. When we ask solution then he gave pain killer only. **** ******* **** ** **** ***** *** ***** ** ******* ******** ***** **** **** *** ***** ** ******* ****** ** **** ****.

Even i have doubt that, it was the case of major fracture. I feel that I would have not gone to him. ",2023-05-09 16:05:37,False,False,Jayant singh,,,

This was my first visit with Dr. Vijayaeswar and I had a very good experience to share. He is very polite and has lot of patience to listen to every information from the patient. He had recommended lab tests that were only necessary to be done and provided genuine medicines for the problem. He is easily reachable through phone and last but not the least the charges are not expensive.

I would highly recommend the Doctor to anyone looking for Orthopedic problems.",2019-07-22 12:33:46,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
