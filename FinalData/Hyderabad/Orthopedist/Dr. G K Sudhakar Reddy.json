Not all will get instant relief and there are no miracles!\nWe have to rule out any underlying organic condition with investigations.\nSome people despite no major findings in the Xray/scans/tests may continue to have pain.

He listen to us attentively and was explained the reason pretty well about the pain she was feeling. Before we reached Dr Sudhakar Reddy we were been to different hospitals and we never felt that they do best to their knowledge and experience. Dr Sudhakar Reddy was extremely humble and professional and treated patient like his own family member. The way he explained about how he his going to do surgery and post surgery treatment was pretty understandable. We have gone through the surgery on 9th of October. Day two after procedure made her stand up and day three made her to walk for few steps and with in five days she started walking with support. Now this is the second week she is walking alone. \r\nOverall I can rate him 10 out of 10 because I have seen him pretty  knowledgable, well experienced, dedicated towards patient, humble and more than that a great human being. I would certainly recommend him for knee replacemnets. I have never ever met a doctor like Dr. Sudhakar Reddy. He is exceptional. ",

Doctors where not available elsewhere  till 10-11 am hence selected this. \nVery good but slightly expensive .  doctor tried different medication and was patient with the kid.   the treatment option recommended was going to cost 6000 INR. Alternate doctor gave option for 25 INR. As the difference is significant hence 4star and not 5 star. \nFacilities, availability of doctor, time given by doctor and nurse, flexibility of staff, cleanliness etc all are very good hence 4 star. Did not take the recommended treatment and went to second doctor only because hospital did not accept max bupa insurance. ",
