I have requested further X-rays & scans after few days since you have had no relief with the initial medication. X-rays to find any bony issues and later MRI to find out any soft tissue problems. This is according to standard protocol as per your presentation. 
Pain, particularly chronic pain is a complex problem. Not all will get instant relief and there are no miracles!
We have to rule out any underlying organic condition with investigations.
Some people despite no major findings in the Xray/scans/tests may continue to have pain. This will require a multimodality approach and will gradually resolve.
