About the doctor he is friendly and he took more time to get brief details about my situation. Basically i have wrist join pain and last time doctor suggested some medicine as prescription and told to use for one month and you guys already know about educated minds and we guys take few things not serious when problem is not troubling very much and try to avoid prescriptions (Because of side effects fear) and i did the same and did not use the tablets and end up making my situation worse(But not out of control by the way) and this time doctor suggested a MRI since my wrist pain is increased and i went for MRI (Doctor suggested Diagnostic center) and cost was high (6K) as usual and i suggest you to go to MRI if you know any MRI center personally to get good discounts and found like small crack in joint and so doctor suggested me to use same course of medicine and suggested a Wrist immobilizer and told to continue for 2 months and that it, i am going to continue the same for next 2 months and i will visit doctor once again and i will write one more review after my third consultation. Thanks and hope this helps",

But my expectation was different since I approached doctor with appointment professionally I was expecting him to suggest much more about issue background  and any natural remedies for my problem etc..(my problem is not very major one I guess, I have pain at right wrist bone joint ) and much more good attention and I don't think my expectation is too much and over all he okey and can't say so much about him  a because I was able talk only 5min and will write one more review after my second meet ",

About the doctor he is friendly and he took more time to get brief details about my situation. Basically i have wrist join pain and last time doctor suggested some medicine as prescription and told to use for one month and you guys already know about educated minds and we guys take few things not serious when problem is not troubling very much and try to avoid prescriptions (Because of side effects fear) and i did the same and did not use the tablets and end up making my situation worse(But not out of control by the way) and this time doctor suggested a MRI since my wrist pain is increased and i went for MRI (Doctor suggested Diagnostic center) and cost was high (6K) as usual and i suggest you to go to MRI if you know any MRI center personally to get good discounts and found like small crack in joint and so doctor suggested me to use same course of medicine and suggested a Wrist immobilizer and told to continue for 2 months and that it, i am going to continue the same for next 2 months and i will visit doctor once again and i will write one more review after my third consultation. Thanks and hope this helps",

But my expectation was different since I approached doctor with appointment professionally I was expecting him to suggest much more about issue background  and any natural remedies for my problem etc..(my problem is not very major one I guess, I have pain at right wrist bone joint ) and much more good attention and I don't think my expectation is too much and over all he okey and can't say so much about him  a because I was able talk only 5min and will write one more review after my second meet ",

My Mother explained all her problems to Dr Ashwin and he suggested few tests and then asked to have medicines for 2 months and he suggested physiotherapy for a week.  After 2 months, we visited him again to convey big THANKS. Yes My mother was cured from all pains and now she is doing her works as usual. Diagnosing the exact problem by taking time and providing an option to patient to explain all his concerns and then treating the patient is what happening at Dr Ashwin sir.  Thanks a lot sir for providing ***** treatment to my mother which helps her to get cured in 2 months! I am writing review so that it will help others to approach a good doctor in Hyderabad. ",

He explained all the causes and reasons while showing us images, I have never seen a doctor do that before. \n\n\nHe was spot on with the treatment and recommended X ray, medicines and physiotherapy. I have recovered completely.\n\n\nHe also explained about the correct posture to work from home and how to set up my workplace,  and said that most IT employees come with the same complaint. He also shared  me exercises PDF to do at home everyday.  \n\n\nSpecial mention to the very friendly staff at  Clinics, who gave me a seamless experience and maintained the clinic so hygienically and nicely. Thank you.\n\nHighly recommended to visit Dr Ashwin for any Orthopaedic problems.",

Then I came to Dr. Ashwin Kasturi sir, from the start of my treatment sir did not raise a word of surgery. He was very sure of healing it naturally . Sir was very supportive and helped me to recover from all the ligament tears within 3 months with all the necessary Physiotherapy and medications. I personally recommend Ashwin sir for any orthopaedic problems.",

Looking at his confidence I went ahead with the small procedure which Dr. Ashwin did by himself. Today, after a week I have my finger functional and I am writing this review.\n\nThanks a lot Dr. Aswin for the crisp treatment at an affordable cost.

He has explained about the problem n have eased my tension. He suggested plaster application and we went ahead with this. Sir was very patient enough to answer all our questions, infact it was a bit longer session than usual. He never appeared to hesitate or remind about time. At the end sir told that he knows the stress the parents undergo in such cases and  have given time to reduce my stress. I would thank Dr Ashwin Kasturi sir for helping us out from the event by both with his treatment and moral support. I would definitely recommend Dr Ashwin Kasturi sir for any Orthopaedic problem. ",

He gives good time and attention, this made me feel happy and forget the waiting time. Treatment suggested by sir worked well, I'm back to normal .

My grandfather had severe right sided knee pain.. and he's complaining of difficulty in moving his limb.. Dr Ashwin clearly explained us the problem, and got an xray done.. and diagnosed it as Osteoarthritis of both the knees. He advised us total knee replacement.. primarily to the Right side.. so I told him that he'd get admitted in a week for the surgery. Best thing about this Doctor.. he's very polite, precise in diagnosis, clear in explanation and promising in convincing us for the surgery. Thanks to Dr Ashwin. ",

Few hospitals didn't even examine but have given medications.\n\nWith a search on Google I found out about Dr Ashwin kasturi sir and decided to visit . I was kept waiting for almost 90 minutes for a consultation, initially I was feeling annoyed and thought that I may not get proper attention due to late issues.\n\nTo my surprise Dr Ashwin kasturi sir has spoken and examined with utmost care and attention, gone through my history in detail. Didn't rush through as the schedule was running late. \n\nFound out the root cause and started treatment accordingly, now I'm doing reasonably well and expecting to get even better in due course of treatment.\n\nIt was worth waiting for getting treatment, for which I was suffering for years.\n\nI would definitely and highly recommend Dr Ashwin kasturi sir for any Orthopedic problems especially unsolved puzzles, he is a gem in clinical practice with very good care.",

Before this, I visited the doctors from few reputed Hospitals, but my problem was overlooked by them. Those so called ******* Hospitals are concerned about the surgery kind of problems such as Hip, Knee replacements etc. \n\nThough my problem looks simple to them, I have been suffering a lot from Foot and Ankle pain for the past 3 months and no one helped to find the cause of the problem. \n\nAs a last option, I went to Dr. Ashwin sir Today and He is so keen in listening my problem. He advised me X-Ray and he explained me the problem and suggested good medication. One good thing is He did not write any pain killers, as many others generally do. He also suggested few exercises, footware, and ankle binders. \n\nDuring my visit, I did not feel that I am with Doctor but I felt that I am with a friend who listens to you and cares about you. \n\nI strongly suggest Dr. Ashwin Kasturi Sir for any orthopedic issues. \n\nThanks again Practo and thanks to Dr. Ashwin Sir. \n\n",

Have booked appointment at 7 PM but had to wait for more than 30 minutes. When booked an appointment at a clinic at a particular time, it should be followed. Secondly, the validity of a consultation is only for a week, other clinics the time period for consultation is for 15-21 days.

I had bad mood before entering Doctors cabin because of heavy traffic jam in Kukatpally. But the moment I entered and met Dr. Ashwin it was stress relieving because he took my mother's file and reviewed each and every details. He took 5 mins to scan all the older reports. Then asked my mom about what problem she has been facing. He listened very carefully to all details and then he started explaining her all problems and reasons for them. He also did not provide any false promises stating all will happen right, he said few damages cannot be recovered in Arthritis but we surely can minimize future problems and suggested nice medicines. I sincerely had a huge sigh of relief and we sat there till all our doubts were cleared. Dr Ashwin nowhere showed that we need to rush even though outside there were patients waiting and it was night 9.00 pm. I would definitely recommend Dr. Ashwin.",
