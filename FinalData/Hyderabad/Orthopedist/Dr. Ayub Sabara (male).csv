None,None,0,0,YES,"
My wife was rushed to Premier Hospitals, Mehdipatnam with an accidental  thigh bone fracture last November .We had no no clue about the extent of injury and the treatment required 
Most fortunately we landed at the right hospital and with the best doctor to attend to her serious injury, Dr Ayub
She underwent an emergency ORIF surgery for broken femur 
Being a senior citizen, natural expectation was that the healing and recovery had to be quite a long drawn process
Major surgery/research places for femur surgeries  in the world like Stanford and Rochester  (USA) and Royal Orthopaedic Hospital , Birmingham (U.K) have enlisted the best protocol for such surgery and we experienced Dr Ayub following precisely such high standards 
My wife was back on her feet without any assistance in just three and a half months. For her age, the normal progression of recovery to normal unassisted walking can take up to 1 year 
Moreover, Dr Ayub  is a very polite doctor with a human healing touch, making the patient cheerful and reassured
I conclude by asserting that our landing with Dr Ayub was fortuitous and auspicious 
God bless DrAyub
