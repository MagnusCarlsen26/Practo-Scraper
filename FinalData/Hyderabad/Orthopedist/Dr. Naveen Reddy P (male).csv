,"Hip Pain Treatment,Fracture Treatment,Arthroplasty,",0,0,YES,"Recently I fall at home and had difficulty to walk. I lost movement in my right leg with unbearable pain. Consulted Dr. Naveen Reddy sir. He diagnosed quickly that I have had fracture at neck of Right Femur, and advised to go for surgery and it is compulsory. 
He executed RT HEMI ORTHO PLASTY HIP CEMENTED Surgery, with his team at Apolo Hospital, Secunderabad on 2nd October 2021.
Now, post surgery pains are there. I can see improvement in my leg movements. Hopefully I may walk again in months time. I found him, very kind, helpful, encouraging and humble.
Thank you so much sir. I remember you for entire my life.
