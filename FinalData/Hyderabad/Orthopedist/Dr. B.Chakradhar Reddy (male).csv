"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,",None,0,0,YES,"I met Dr Chakradhar Reddy after my knee fracture in April 2017. It was a type 6 fracture with separation with multiple fractures in tibial plateau and crack going to 1/3rd the length of tibia, with displacement. Dr Reddy stabilized the knee with plate and screws once the swelling subsided and then the recovery period started. Right from the starting it was clear that the fracture was pretty complex. Knee surgery was successful and no complications arose . What helped us was the confidence of doctor and explanation of what was happening and discussion about what to expect next at each stage. The recovery is still ongoing but I am in much better condition now and am much more confident now. Fracture recoveries are long drawn processes and you need a doctor who has the expertise and is responsive. Dr Reddy has both these qualities.",2017-10-01 06:14:33,False,True,Rhythm Pandey,,,
