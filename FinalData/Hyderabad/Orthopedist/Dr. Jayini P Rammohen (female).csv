After I was told that I needed a shoulder surgery for Bankart lesion, I consulted a lot of doctors to verify whether I actually needed a surgery or not. Although every doctor’s diagnosis were same, it was only when I met Dr Jayini, I was fully confident about going for the surgery. 

I was beyond impressed with my experience at Dr. Rammohen’s office. I find that doctors usually are distracted or rushed when visiting their patients, but not with Dr. Rammohen. He gave full attention even for my post-op visits and would patiently listen to all my worries and the progress I made. I had the sense that my doctor REALLY cared about my whole being and not just the fact that I needed a physical exam and some other work done. We also discussed vitamin supplements and he made recommendations as to what I need.  He even helped dealing with the insurance which is not at all his job, really keeps no stone unturned when it comes to looking after his patient. Also, despite having a busy practice, I’m almost always able to schedule an appt.
