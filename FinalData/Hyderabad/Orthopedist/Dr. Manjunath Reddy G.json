Inspite of that I considered to see her because she is a elderly lady. Second I diagnosed properly the fracture and I gave options to her. I totally refused to put plaster because the patient skin is fragile. She came back after two days to me and insisted to put plaster. I warned her about this problem. Basically this lady leave her mother to caretakers. This is what happens. Basically the patient needs proper care. That is lacking here. Last thing about money we have discounted her charges. Don\u2019t believe these type of badmouthing about us. They want to show all their personal frustrations on us. Finally whatever it is I wish her speedy recovery. Thank you",

Inspite of that I considered to see her because she is a elderly lady. Second I diagnosed properly the fracture and I gave options to her. I totally refused to put plaster because the patient skin is fragile. She came back after two days to me and insisted to put plaster. I warned her about this problem. Basically this lady leave her mother to caretakers. This is what happens. Basically the patient needs proper care. That is lacking here. Last thing about money we have discounted her charges. Don\u2019t believe these type of badmouthing about us. They want to show all their personal frustrations on us. Finally whatever it is I wish her speedy recovery. Thank you",
