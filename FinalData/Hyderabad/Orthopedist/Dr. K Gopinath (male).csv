,,0,0,YES,"I would personally highly recommend Dr.Gopinath as I've been his patient for the last 7 years. He treated me for my severe PottsSpine where I had injuries at four places in the spine and vertebra. He made sure I don't have to go for surgery, and he was and is still available on call whenever I need. His treatment procedures include minimum and only essential medicines, and his explanations for the ailment that the patient is suffering through are simple that are understood by the patient. His friendly nature makes patients believe that they are in safe hands. He is more than a family doctor for us, rather I would say that he has become an inseparable part of my family now. I'm always grateful that he's been very supportive throughout my disease journey. Thank you very much, Dr. Gopinath, for making me survive without any health problems now.",2020-12-23 13:46:22,False,True,Harpreet Kaur,,,
,,0,0,NO,"Dear All, 

Dr. Gopinath is a very experience and renowned doctor and has treated thousands of patients for the knee and other problem. 

However, I have seen a very bad habit, poor time management.  It actually effects both doctor and patient. 

Patients and their caretaker come at the designated time, but due to urgency, or see other patients, he forget that he need to attend attend or treat the patients in the treatment area while doing consultation. 

They wait for hours and hours from morning till evening just to have a 15-30 minutues of his time.  He could have informed them earlier about the delay in advance or every 2 hours or regular intervals, he could take 30 min off and treat the earlier patients.  

We understand his time is precious and had to attend when emergency comes and leave the rest...but not this way.   Was little disappointed with this mis-management of such renowned doctor.
