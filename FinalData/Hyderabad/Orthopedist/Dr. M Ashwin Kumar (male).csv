,,0,0,YES,"Expereinced doctor with empathy for his patients-I Consulted the doctor for back pain and then subsequently for my father's fracture. Each time the experience was beyond expectation. No unnecessary investigations or procedure. Investigations are only what is required, diagnosis and treatment is to the point!

For me he insisted on getting an MRI scan done for my spine and prescribed exercises and pain relieving medicines. I was fit within a week and have never had the pain again.

For my 82 year father again one x ray, one physical consultation and bed rest as advised did the trick. No unnecesary procedures. He was available for follow up consultations over phone and responded to all our queries on whatsapp. So we always felt under his active care.

Thank you Dr Ashwin for all that you did for us!

,,0,0,Yes,"Consultation experience was good with him. He is amicable and explained well. Patient is my brother, we visited for him now, he is good. It was good and the doctor treatment was excellent, my brother is now very well. The suggestion doctor gave it was helping him to resolve the problem. He is an amicable person and his posture is good. I would definitely recommend the doctor to others. We waited for the consultation even though we were satisfied, this was our first visit to the doctor. Whatever the discussion about the subject there should not be a limit between patient and the doctor then only he can know all the things of health issue of the doctor. He makes patients comfortable while talking. ",2020-01-28 18:42:40,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
