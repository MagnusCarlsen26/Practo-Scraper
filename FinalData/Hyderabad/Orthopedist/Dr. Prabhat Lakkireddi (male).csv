"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Arthroscopy,Bankart Repair,",0,0,YES,"I had been operated by Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi on Aug 16 2018 for an Arthroscopic Bankart repair surgery on my right shoulder, which is a minimally invasive surgery to repair instability and restore function of a dislocated shoulder. I live in the United States and the injury first occurred while playing volleyball and later dislocated on several occasions while swimming, basketball, cricket etc. totaling to about 6 painful dislocations. This is common in Athletes wherein a few tend to put the shoulder back into position without pain, but for me, I am well built at 6ft/ 85kgs and when the shoulder dislocates the whole body is like locked and the only position of the body is to kneel and lay my arm on the ground. The body in an uncomfortable position and the pain is immense.

On my visit to India, I've searched the web and found Dr. Lakkireddi on Practo. He was my first choice but was hesitant to visit him because of where he practiced. (Don't ask me why). I had seen a couple of Doctors before I visited Dr Lakkireddi but finally opted purely based off the reviews on Practo and this time followed my gut and gave it a shot. I was very impressed on the first visit for the reason, he speaks to you as someone you've know for a while and him just being more than a Doctor. Most Doctors explain the issue and the treatment needed which to me is common, but its the confidence that Doctor creates in the patient who needs to get treated moreover a surgery. I've been in pain for more than 2yrs and did not want to go under the knife for the wrong reasons. 

I had planned for a surgery earlier at another hospital, had my MRI reports/ blood work done but backed off due to bad experience just 1 hour before the surgery. Dr. Lakkireddi used the same reports and blood work to diagnose and I decided to go for the surgery without a second thought. It all happened in 10-15min and that's the confidence he created in me as a Doctor that you don't see anymore or rarely. 

I am proud that I made my decision and thanks to Dr. Lakkireddi and his office assistant Venkat, Dr Shekar Reddy (Anesthesia) and his other team members (Sorry I don't recall the names) for helping me out. The surgery was a bit complex than expected as I might have damaged due to multiple dislocations. Its been 4 months that I had the surgery and I am recovering well. I had done a lot of research online on the Bankart Repair before the surgery and being sports person and its easy for me to do a rehab and adopt to physiotherapy. I've visited Dr Lakkireddi a couple of times after the surgery but never got a chance to interact on the Physiotherapy as I had to leave back to the U.S. I am working on my own and have a full movement but will go for muscle strengthening over the next few months and I shall see Dr. Lakkireddi on my next visit to India.

I would like explain in detail about what happened and how Dr..Prabhath sir was helpful, sorry for the detailed feedback and hope this helps patients with similar problem.

Background: I was frequently twisting my ankle from last three years, I visited some orthopedic doctors in Chennai (I was staying in Chennai at that time and later moved to Hyderabad) and I didn't find them helpful and neither they understood my problem. I visited Dr.Prabhath in February when I again badly injured my ankle while playing Cricket and on my first visit Dr told me there is some problem with one of my Ligament called ATFL and suggested to take rest and after a month of taking some tablets suggested a CT Scan. In the scan it is confirmed that my ATFL ligament got tored and it requires surgery to reconstruct.I took other doctors opinion in Hyderabad and they also said  the same about surgery.

Process: I got my ATFL ligament  reconstructed with internal Brace in June 2018 with Dr Prabhath and  it's been close to 6months and I started jogging with no pain and as of now my ankle looks stable.I would say recovery is very good with very less medication and I appreciate how all this process went through with Dr.Prabhat sir.

For the following reasons I would suggest Dr.Prabhath Lakireddy.
1. Detailed explanation of the problem. Dr.Prabhath explained me what happened to mmy ankle and what should be done and what happens if we don't go for it's repair.
2. Time he spends with patients and having lot of patience in answering our doubts and questions.
3. Before the surgery he told me the procedure name and even told me to check in Google for some details and at the same time asked me not to go for too much details which might confuse.
4. Surgery went very well and I was discharged next day with an advise of rest for 2 months and a total rest for 6 months. I was suggested Calcium supplements for 3 months and pain killers for two weeks. Very less medication or no unnecessary medications.
5. No physiotherapy suggested. He told few excersices to do everyday and it helped a lot.
6. Avoids unnecessary lab tests and he asks every time if we can afford scan or not which is very rare.

It's been 5years since I relocated from LONDON after 10 long years. I see a significant change in the trust patient have on me now than five years back. 
Initial years when I recommended surgery, quite a few of my patients used to go for second opinion to another doctor. 
I have seen a gradual built of trust in my recommendation and quality of care has improved significantly. 
Now I see more than 50% patients coming to me for second opinion. More than 90% trust me and go with my recommendation of NO OPERATION OR OPERATION LIKE ARTHROSCOPY OR JOINT REPLACEMENT.
It is very sad to see that the trust patients have on doctors is going down over years. When I look at patients coming for second opinion, more than half of them did not actual need surgery. 
I wonder why any doctor should choose that path. I believe in FIRST WIN THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF PATIENT, THEY WILL ALWAYS COME FOR YOU AND TAKE YOUR WORD"".

The doc never hurried and tried to give me more time, explained the crux of the issue and even sent me a few videos for me to understand and mentally prepare myself. He was extremely professional during surgery right from his patience in explaining the issue in detail both to family and me before surgery n after surgery to his care for his patients makes him stand out. While it was supposed to be a meniscus surgery once he started the scopy and realized that my ACL was damaged as well, explained the issue to my family showed photos and took their consent to fix that as well since it was the root cause of the meniscus injury n a better permanent fix. I really liked his honesty here as he could have simple gone ahead with meniscus repair as planned but his genuine intent of fixing the knee for good and suggesting whats the right thing to do for patients is appreciable. The time he gives to patients even during appointments is noteworthy. If you are looking for an ortho look no further. He has a really good support team as well Venkat who manages appointments n paperwork, Krishna one of the physio under him are very professional and good at what they do.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"I visited Doctor for ACL reconstruction and meniscus surgery.
I had torn ACL and visited few Doctors for ACL reconstruction surgery. Did online research and with reference from distant friends, met Dr. Prabhat. After carefully listening to the problem and the surgical procedure, finally decided to go with Dr. Prabhat. He explained  everything for all my questions (some very silly questions as well), and got confidence after meeting and talking to him.  My observations are - he is very patient, friendly and care for patients.  

After all the  pre-tests and formalities and insurance approvals, I got my surgery done on  22nd Apr 2019.  I was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day and discharged on the same day. Met the doctor again on 10 May 2019 for stitches removal.  I went to meet Dr for consultation by walking with knee brace support from hospital entrance. 
I started walking without walker and brace immediately after few days from then. For Physiotherapy I used the 3rd party services initaially. When I met next time after a month for consultation, he is not happy with the progress and suggested me to take help from the Physio who works for him and gave his improvement suggestions to Physio.
Next time when i met after 2 months, The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress. Its almost 9 months since surgrey done and didnt face any issues. 

Venkat who is support staff, was very helpful for all the appointments and scheduling my surgery. Rohit, Phsio, did my physiotherapy and helped me to recover fast!

I strongly suggest Dr. Prabhat for all ACL surgeries and consultation!

HAPPY KNEE. In the view of negative feedback given by one of my patients parent two months back, I wish to discuss about MONEY AND ETHICS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. And DETERIORATING OPINION ON DOCTORS.
I see an average 30-40patients a day which around 6000/year. If 8 out of 6000 give me a negative feedback, I don’t worry as mostly are about delays in clinic which are beyond my control during an emergency case. But even if one patient comments about about my MEDICAL ETHICS, that hurts me and make me look into my inner conscious and question myself “am I the unethical person the lady is taking about.” 
I will give an example of how PATIENTS INTERPRET DECISION MAKING.
I saw a 12year old child with knee dislocation. Scan shows ligament tear which needs surgery. If you go for a second opinion, there is very fair chance the doctor won’t agree with surgical decision as we know that most patients coming second opinion don’t want surgery at that point. Does this mean that first date is unethical ? Of course I see on a daily basis where surgery was wrongly suggested when there is absolutely no indication. 
KNEE LIGAMENT INJURIES NEED SURGERY NOT TO IMPROVE PAIN, but to prevent any instability in future which when untreated leads to arthritis in joint over 5years. So if you treat a ACL TEAR  patient without surgery, he will walk again in properly in few weeks. That doesn’t mean surgery is not required at all.  Most  people slowly damage the joint because of knee jerking with every step and worse with running or playing sports. How do I make patient understand the long term issues. 
I operate some knee ligament injuries immediately after injury and some even 4-5 years after the ligament tear. The difference between those two cases  is the damage done to joint in patients who have delayed surgery. 
So QUESTIONING ETHICALITY OF A GOOD DOCTOR IS WRONG.  We study close to 30years to understand the intricacies in decision making. How can a person judge a doctor  based on information gathered in few minutes from google or from another doctor ? 
Please question yourself, before posting demoralising statements.",2020-02-03T16:55:50+0000,Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi
None,"Ligament Reconstruction,",0,0,Yes," I fell while bowling in cricket match. I could walk but could not push my knee forward . My first option was to visit Dr Prabhat as I was taking my mom der for back pain. Once I reached the hospital doctor just checked my knee movement and told that it could be a ligament tear and for the confirmation I was asked to go for MRI and in MRI it was diagnosed to be complete ACL tear. Prabhat told me that for ACL complete tear there is no option than to go for surgery. Venkat who assists Prabhat has taken the required insurance details and completed the formalities for cashless treatment within a day. Doctor gives such a confidence that you never feel that you are going to have surgery. He explained me in detail about the procedure and I was happy that I came to right person for treatment. surgery was done on 15th June 2017 and was about to stand on the next day itself. Even after the surgery the following day doctor his junior  Kundan and Venkat have visited me to check the status . It's good to see them so concerned about a patient. Today I have gone there to remove the staples and it always done in a minute without pain. Doctor and his team which includes Venkat karuna Kundan Shekar all of them are very friendly and you never feel that you are a patient over there. Every visit there will be like you are going to meet your buddies and have a casual talk. And one more thing there will always be a new motivational quote in the doctor's room.

Got the surgery done on 2nd March 2017. Was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day.. Met the doctor again on 15th March 2017, I went on wheel chair to the doctor's consultation room.. He told(funnily) that he would charge me for the wheel chair if I come next time and told that I do not need to use walker or any brace.. I started walking without walker and brace immediately after two days from then.. Then next time, i.e on 1st April 2017 I went to him alone without any support for walking.. The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress.. obviously I was the happiest too..

It's been 5years since I relocated from LONDON after 10 long years. I see a significant change in the trust patient have on me now than five years back. 
Initial years when I recommended surgery, quite a few of my patients used to go for second opinion to another doctor. 
I have seen a gradual built of trust in my recommendation and quality of care has improved significantly. 
Now I see more than 50% patients coming to me for second opinion. More than 90% trust me and go with my recommendation of NO OPERATION OR OPERATION LIKE ARTHROSCOPY OR JOINT REPLACEMENT.
It is very sad to see that the trust patients have on doctors is going down over years. When I look at patients coming for second opinion, more than half of them did not actual need surgery. 
I wonder why any doctor should choose that path. I believe in FIRST WIN THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF PATIENT, THEY WILL ALWAYS COME FOR YOU AND TAKE YOUR WORD"".

He was extremely professional during surgery right from his patience in explaining the issue in detail both to family and me before surgery n after surgery to his care for his patients makes him stand out. While it was supposed to be a meniscus surgery once he started the scopy and realized that my ACL was damaged as well, explained the issue to my family showed photos and took their consent to fix that as well since it was the root cause of the meniscus injury n a better permanent fix. I really liked his honesty here as he could have simple gone ahead with meniscus repair as planned but his genuine intent of fixing the knee for good and suggesting whats the right thing to do for patients is appreciable.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"I visited Doctor for ACL reconstruction and meniscus surgery.
I had torn ACL and visited few Doctors for ACL reconstruction surgery. Did online research and with reference from distant friends, met Dr. Prabhat. After carefully listening to the problem and the surgical procedure, finally decided to go with Dr. Prabhat. He explained  everything for all my questions (some very silly questions as well), and got confidence after meeting and talking to him.  My observations are - he is very patient, friendly and care for patients.  

After all the  pre-tests and formalities and insurance approvals, I got my surgery done on  22nd Apr 2019.  I was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day and discharged on the same day. Met the doctor again on 10 May 2019 for stitches removal.  I went to meet Dr for consultation by walking with knee brace support from hospital entrance. 
I started walking without walker and brace immediately after few days from then. For Physiotherapy I used the 3rd party services initaially. When I met next time after a month for consultation, he is not happy with the progress and suggested me to take help from the Physio who works for him and gave his improvement suggestions to Physio.
Next time when i met after 2 months, The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress. Its almost 9 months since surgrey done and didnt face any issues. 

Venkat who is support staff, was very helpful for all the appointments and scheduling my surgery. Rohit, Phsio, did my physiotherapy and helped me to recover fast!

I strongly suggest Dr. Prabhat for all ACL surgeries and consultation!

Thank you Dr!

HAPPY KNEE. In the view of negative feedback given by one of my patients parent two months back, I wish to discuss about MONEY AND ETHICS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. And DETERIORATING OPINION ON DOCTORS.
I see an average 30-40patients a day which around 6000/year. If 8 out of 6000 give me a negative feedback, I don’t worry as mostly are about delays in clinic which are beyond my control during an emergency case. But even if one patient comments about about my MEDICAL ETHICS, that hurts me and make me look into my inner conscious and question myself “am I the unethical person the lady is taking about.” 
I will give an example of how PATIENTS INTERPRET DECISION MAKING.
I saw a 12year old child with knee dislocation. Scan shows ligament tear which needs surgery. If you go for a second opinion, there is very fair chance the doctor won’t agree with surgical decision as we know that most patients coming second opinion don’t want surgery at that point. Does this mean that first date is unethical ? Of course I see on a daily basis where surgery was wrongly suggested when there is absolutely no indication. 
KNEE LIGAMENT INJURIES NEED SURGERY NOT TO IMPROVE PAIN, but to prevent any instability in future which when untreated leads to arthritis in joint over 5years. So if you treat a ACL TEAR  patient without surgery, he will walk again in properly in few weeks. That doesn’t mean surgery is not required at all.  Most  people slowly damage the joint because of knee jerking with every step and worse with running or playing sports. How do I make patient understand the long term issues. 
I operate some knee ligament injuries immediately after injury and some even 4-5 years after the ligament tear. The difference between those two cases  is the damage done to joint in patients who have delayed surgery. 
So QUESTIONING ETHICALITY OF A GOOD DOCTOR IS WRONG.  We study close to 30years to understand the intricacies in decision making. How can a person judge a doctor  based on information gathered in few minutes from google or from another doctor ? 
Please question yourself, before posting demoralising statements.",2020-02-03T16:55:50+0000,Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi

Once I reached the hospital doctor just checked my knee movement and told that it could be a ligament tear and for the confirmation I was asked to go for MRI and in MRI it was diagnosed to be complete ACL tear. Prabhat told me that for ACL complete tear there is no option than to go for surgery. Venkat who assists Prabhat has taken the required insurance details and completed the formalities for cashless treatment within a day. Doctor gives such a confidence that you never feel that you are going to have surgery. He explained me in detail about the procedure and I was happy that I came to right person for treatment. surgery was done on 15th June 2017 and was about to stand on the next day itself. Even after the surgery the following day doctor his junior  Kundan and Venkat have visited me to check the status . It's good to see them so concerned about a patient. Today I have gone there to remove the staples and it always done in a minute without pain. Doctor and his team which includes Venkat karuna Kundan Shekar all of them are very friendly and you never feel that you are a patient over there.

I was able to walk with the help of a walker within a day, a stick within a week and without any support within 2 weeks. The artificial ligament which the doctor has used for the operation ruled out any initial hiccups as it provided stability from Day 1. 

The doctor is easily available and we have kept a constant connect post operation reviewing the progress every 2 weeks. For the meniscus tear, the doctor suggested another advanced technique where blood platelets were extracted and then injected into the knee. This allowed the Meniscus to regrow as it was only a partial tear.

THE GOLDEN RULE- PROPER CLINICAL ASSESSMENT IS THE KEY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT. 
simple ruleS- 
1LIGAMENT OUTSIDE the joint like MCL,LCL MOST OF THE TIMES HEAL THEM SELVES, SOME TIMES WE NEED TO INJECT PRP TO HELP IN FASTER HEALING. 
2, LIGAMENTS INSIDE the knee or shoulder LIKE ACL, PCL, MENISCUS, CARTILAGE DONT HEAL them selves for the simple reason is there is poor blood circulation for these ligaments. 
GUIDELINES:
1. complete ACL, PCL tears need surgery arthroscopic reconstruction. 
2. Unstable meniscus tears need arthroscopic surgery.
3. Stable meniscal tears need rest and or REGENERATIVE TREATMENTS LIKE PRP OR BMAC.
4. PARTIAL ACL OR PCL tears need rest, repeat clinical assessments for developing instability, and or REGENERATIVE TREATMENTS LIKE PRP AND BMAC.

1. PRP: PLATELET RICH PLASMA- eg- when we have a cut our skin, it heals competely even without any medications. this fantastic healing potential is because of PLATELETS. we use the same principle to treat joint problems in knee & shoulder like osteoarthritis, partial meniscal tear, partial ACL tear, partial rotator cuff tear.
2. BMAC: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE CONCENTRATE- 
SIMILAR TO PRP BUT MORE EFFECTIVE AS IT has bone marrow derived STEM CELLS WHICH CAN REPAIR ANY TISSUE. 
BMAC HAS A SPECIAL ROLE IN KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND A DREADFUL CONDITION CALLED AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF HIP. bmac can prevent progression to hip replacement
3. REGROW- CHONDRON, OSSGROW: 
The BEST TREATMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LESS THAN 50 YEARS OLD WITH CARTILAGE DAMAGE OF KNEE, AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF HIP. what our body can't repair, we grow cartilage or bone cells outside in a lab and implant in the damaged area.

1. AN EXPENSIVE IMPLANT DOESNT MEAN EXCELLENT RESULTS. Most times gold standard knee implants give same results as expensive ones.
2. knee replacement is life time surgery. Don't get trapped by getting it done by some one who does ten a day. a good knee surgery takes an hour to operate, and it is physically not possible for a single surgeon to do a more than four GOOD QUALITY SURGERIES IN A DAY. IN UK YOU COME UNDER SCRUTINY IF YOU ARE OPERATING MORE THAN FIVE KNEE REPLACEMENTS A DAY, AS EVIDENCE HAD SHOWN THAT THEY HAVE POOR RESULTS WITH HIGH FAILURES.
3. EVERY ONE OF US ARE UNIQUE, DONT COMPARE WITH ANOTHER PATIENT. Even in my own patients who under went BOTH KNEE REPLACEMENT, one knee recovers faster than other knee. SO DONT COMPARE, DON'T SET A HARD TARGET FOR RECOVERY.
