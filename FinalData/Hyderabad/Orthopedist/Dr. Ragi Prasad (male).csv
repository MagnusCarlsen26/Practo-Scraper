"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Knee Pain Treatment,",0,0,NO,"The doc checked and suggested a x-ray. I came out the docs cabin and was in two minds if I should take it immediately or not. Told the cashier that I'll get it done outside and left. However, I changed my mind and went back and got it done there itself. When I took the report and went in, the doc checked the report and while writing the medicine said : ""it is a privilege that we have a x-ray here itself. If you go out at this time no place will accept to do a x-ray. You should be thankful we have it here itself."" My though on this:
1. So just in the 5 mins I took to decide, the information from the cashier was passed to the doc inside.
2. How is it a privilege when we are paying for it? It's a service. I'll call it a privilege when it's given free to the patients. (I don't expect it to be free but I didn't expect it to be a privilege either)
3. Why is the doctor sitting in his room given all the information of my activity outside! *** * ***** ****** * ****** ** **** ** *** ***** ******** * ******** **** **** ******* ** ********* ** *** ******* ** ********** *** **** ***** *********** *** *** *********

",2019-03-31 07:20:23,False,False,Adithya,This  review is false and inappropriate. Pateint is very suspicious from beginning. When X ray was asked he took 30 mts to decide whether to get x ray here or outside and went out and later returned as its not available outside because its late night. All the Medicines in pharmacy are from Govt certified and MNC companies but he didn't even step in to the pharmacy and for some strange reason wanted only from outside. He didn't even inform us. Thats a simple paracetamol related tablet which is available any where. We never meant its privilege to get x ray but our staff only meant at 9:30 pm you are for what reason thought to get x ray done outside. Sir you are very suspicious of everything and looked very comfortable but wrote a long review shows everything. If you have a problem atleast tell us.,2019-04-09T06:32:16+0000,Dr. Ragi Prasad
