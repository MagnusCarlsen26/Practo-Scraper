,,0,0,Yes,My father in law had consulted the doctor and it was for heart checkup. Consultation was good by the doctor. We met him thrice. I can surely recommend doctor to others. We are satisfied with the explanation given by the doctor. ECG was done. There was not much waiting time in the hospital when we went. He is heart patient. Doctor was friendly. ,2021-05-26 05:20:22,False,True,user,,,

I had my first consultation in 2016 when I had a heart attack. As per his valuable advice I have gone for angioplasty and leading a healthy life now. His approach to the issues and friendly behaviour attract me a lot. After that my brother also had heart problem and undergone angioplasty as per his advice. I am very much impressed by his approach and friendliness.,2021-03-05 14:00:17,False,True,M.VISHNU NAMBOODIRI,,,
