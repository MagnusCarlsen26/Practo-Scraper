Although my dad & his reports were not in station, he eagerly looked into the Angiogram video (done in a different place) of my father in my mobile and suggesting corrective treatments. He patiently advised me many things and repeated them again & again for my better understanding. The operation was done by Dr. Girish and although it was critical, it was successful. Dr. Venkatesh has visited us many times during our stay at the hospital despite his busy schedule to enquire about the wellbeing of my father.  During the follow up visits Dr. Venkatesh has examined my Dad with upmost details, gave proper advices, and suggested & changed medicine courses to suit my dad\u2019s body as he has high blood pressure & diabetics. I wish him great success in his career and love from his patients.",
