Dr Pradeep Haranahalli who was at the emergency saw her and diagnosed her condition as atrial fibrilation and arrhythmia. He told us that her heartbeat needs to be stabilized and then see the cause of the of high heartbeat. He mentioned that it will take 1 to 2 days for the heartbeat to to stabilize. And he was bang on. She recuperated in the four days and was discharged. Dr Pradeep really took care of her and was very patient for our questions and gave a very thoughtful and balanced answer. One time I called him to ask a question after 9 PM but he didn't pick up the phone, as he might be busy. So I thought he may not call me back but to my surprise he did call me and clarified my question (I was happy). After her heartbeat was stabilized he said that she needs to be on medication and there is no need for surgery. He also did an angiogram and told there were no blockages. I feel this doctor is really good and he is not trying to make $$$ unnecessarily by scaring the patient's family(under duress), as some do. He is a very calm, quiet, ************* and thoughtful Doctor who gives ear to the patient's family. Once I told to the doctor that the food was not given on time to the patient in HDU. So immediately he summoned the nurses / canteen manager and told them such things should not have happened and not to happen again. He also very nicely and clearly explained the anti blood clot medications (the new one vis-a-vis the world one). I really appreciate his selfless treatment. Thank you Doctre.",

And as things unfolded she was diagnosed with endometrial adinocarcinoma of the uterus, grade I which  in plain words is first stage cancer of the uterus. This was terrible news for us for which we were mentally and otherwise not prepared. \nBut eventually the cancerous tumour was surgically removed before which numerous tests were done on her to evaluate her preparedness for surgery. It was during this that I came in contact with Dr Pradeep who turned out to be more than I had bargained for. He is such a gentleman, very mild-mannered and reassuring and always listening to her problems to be of help. To say the least he is one of those not having the airs of being a specialist doctor and very firmly rooted to the earth. Like a teacher he would explain the problems related to her and how he planned to get over it. My wife was a little apprehensive before the angiogram was done on her but she told me later that Dr Pradeep allayed all her fears and did the procedure commendably. Moreover he went out of his way to get us the results as quickly as possible. Even after the surgery whenever we went to the hospital for follow-up which was quite frequent we might come across him discussing something with a patient or doctor but he would immediately notice us from afar and acknowledge our presence. This was really a welcome gesture on his part which I think surely goes a long way to make the rapport with he instantaneously makes with his patients. I would occasionally ask him certain queries regarding my wife and he would immediately respond with a smile.  I still maintain contact with him even so many months after she was released from the hospital. I may mention here that my wife is at present okay by the grace of God.\nI said so at our time in the hospital to him and I am saying it again that Dr Pradeep Haranahalli  has the markings of a true doctor and he will surely make a name for him. I wish him all success from my heart.\n",

My father lives in Odisha, 83 years that time, had then undergone angioplasty in one of his arteries. The second artery needed rotablation, which the doctor in Bhubaneswar was hesitant to do. So I decided meet 3-4 famous cardiologists in Bangalore (Narayani Hridalaya, Manipal old airport rd) with my father's reports and take opinion. What struck me about Dr Pradeep is his silent confidence. He was through, made detailed notes, saw all the reports/CDs. He was confident that the proceedure can be safely done despite of old age. He clearly conveyed to us that age is not a factor in such surgeries. We liked his attitude because it was different from other doctors who discouraged us to try anything because of old age. (My father was fit otherwise). I was living in US that time where people drive till 88 years if they are healthy.\nWe decided to go with Doctor Pradeep because of his thoroughness, confidence, accessibility. In 2018 my father came down from Odisha and after check up was decided to implant pacemaker. Dr Pradeep took a special care, from admission till discharge. He himself was present with the nurses in all post -surgical processes. He was very patient with my father, in mobilizing him etc. Today my father has a big trust on him. He lives in Odisha and I moved to another country but we are in contact with Doctor Pradeep via phone, whatsapp on medicine doses, advice etc. We are fortunate to have met Dr Pradeep. We highly recommend others. He wants to genuinely help patients.  ",

He was having this known health issue in the past seven years but now the condition was bad and needed an immediate attention. Previously he was under assumption that he was having some minor leakage in heart for which he was already consuming tablets but without any significant outcome. By god's grace things fell in place just at the right time as we met Dr Pradeep.  He started diagnosing my father step by step from beginning through various tests. Very soon he arrived at the conclusion that my father is having some serious blockage in left main coronary artery that was causing the chest pain. He then called upon Dr. Vivek Babu Bojjawar, discussed the issue, and recommended to go for CABG procedure as the blockage was more than 70 percent and angioplasty stenting won't be successful. I am very much thankful to both Dr Pradeep and Dr Vivek who clearly explained me the current condition and also explained why CABG was necessary. They provided me adequate clinical information that helped me to confidently provide my consent for the CABG procedure. All went as per the schedule. The procedure was successfully carried out by Dr Vivek, Dr Pradeep and their expert team of doctors that took around 4 hours. In a week's time my father was discharged from hospital. In little more than a month he was fully recovered and back to normal. Now he is completely back to life. Just within 3 months of time lot many things have changed for good. To speak few words about Dr Pradeep, he is a very nice person who listened to all our concerns very carefully and provided his expert recommendation. A very highly responsible and approachable person who understands and respects patient's sentiments. ** *** *** **** ********* ** *** ***** *** quick enough in taking the right decision.

After waiting for more than an hour we got our change to visit the doctor since he did not come on time, he saw the reports and asked for another test done. we got the test done and went with reports. But refused to take a look at the reports until all the patients are done with consultation we were ok with that also, then he told us to sit in the consultation room and said he will be back in 2 mins but he came after 30 mins and said all the reports are fine. In this whole process he spent time with us is less than 10 mins and it took us 3 and 1/2 hours to wait. Its really a bad process to keep the elderly waiting for so long. If they think there are too many appointments why do they allow so many to book. ** *** *** *** **** **** ** ****** *** *** ***** *** ********* **** ************ **** *** ******* ********** ",

And the 2nd surprising thing was that when I asked them to connect with doctor. He also said the same thing and they have cancelled my appointment without asking me. I just went to show my cholestrol report and nothing else. Why should I pay consultation charge again for showing the report which was pending. Bit the doc denied straightly. It was said first pay 700 bucks and then enter the doc room.I already asked the doc that can I come after few days for cholesterol report as my office timing was not matching with my appointment. He was fine with it at that time. Very disappointed. And then I left the place. *** *** *** ** ******** ***",

Dr Pradeep helped us understand the severity of the situation from the get go and also suggested the necessary procedure which needed to be done for eliminating the problem. The Procedure was conducted at the earliest and was done hassle-free. \nDr Pradeep did not only eliminate the problem but was also approachable for every doubt, question or second thoughts we had in mind both in person and over phone as well. From the beginning of the treatment, we were made completely aware of the way things were unfolding and there was no moment of ambiguity regarding it. My father is doing well now and is living a normal life. We are very glad we met Dr Pradeep for my father's heart issue and that he is able to get back to his normal life now after treatment with a new vigor. ",

He took every possible care to treat my father in law and send him home in much better condition after doing his angioplasty flawlessly. Dr pradeep is not only a very good doctor but also a very good human who understands the emotional crisis of the patient and his family. He explained everything very clearly from day one and did not conduct any unnecessary tests also helped us to take my father in law home one day early which indirectly saved a handsome amount for us.\nThe best part of the doctor is he is always available over phone for any help or any advice required. In  case if he cannot take your call his assistant will and very surprisingly you can expect a call back from Dr Pradeep which was beyond our expectation from a busy doctor like him. \nAfter all i think he showed up as a blessing for us. I definitely 101% recommend him for any cardiology construction. ",

Dr Pradeep Haranahalli who was at the emergency saw her and diagnosed her condition as atrial fibrilation and arrhythmia. He told us that her heartbeat needs to be stabilized and then see the cause of the of high heartbeat. He mentioned that it will take 1 to 2 days for the heartbeat to to stabilize. And he was bang on. She recuperated in the four days and was discharged. Dr Pradeep really took care of her and was very patient for our questions and gave a very thoughtful and balanced answer. One time I called him to ask a question after 9 PM but he didn't pick up the phone, as he might be busy. So I thought he may not call me back but to my surprise he did call me and clarified my question (I was happy). After her heartbeat was stabilized he said that she needs to be on medication and there is no need for surgery. He also did an angiogram and told there were no blockages. I feel this doctor is really good and he is not trying to make $$$ unnecessarily by scaring the patient's family(under duress), as some do. He is a very calm, quiet, ************* and thoughtful Doctor who gives ear to the patient's family. Once I told to the doctor that the food was not given on time to the patient in HDU. So immediately he summoned the nurses / canteen manager and told them such things should not have happened and not to happen again. He also very nicely and clearly explained the anti blood clot medications (the new one vis-a-vis the world one). I really appreciate his selfless treatment. Thank you Doctre.",

And as things unfolded she was diagnosed with endometrial adinocarcinoma of the uterus, grade I which  in plain words is first stage cancer of the uterus. This was terrible news for us for which we were mentally and otherwise not prepared. \nBut eventually the cancerous tumour was surgically removed before which numerous tests were done on her to evaluate her preparedness for surgery. It was during this that I came in contact with Dr Pradeep who turned out to be more than I had bargained for. He is such a gentleman, very mild-mannered and reassuring and always listening to her problems to be of help. To say the least he is one of those not having the airs of being a specialist doctor and very firmly rooted to the earth. Like a teacher he would explain the problems related to her and how he planned to get over it. My wife was a little apprehensive before the angiogram was done on her but she told me later that Dr Pradeep allayed all her fears and did the procedure commendably. Moreover he went out of his way to get us the results as quickly as possible. Even after the surgery whenever we went to the hospital for follow-up which was quite frequent we might come across him discussing something with a patient or doctor but he would immediately notice us from afar and acknowledge our presence. This was really a welcome gesture on his part which I think surely goes a long way to make the rapport with he instantaneously makes with his patients. I would occasionally ask him certain queries regarding my wife and he would immediately respond with a smile.  I still maintain contact with him even so many months after she was released from the hospital. I may mention here that my wife is at present okay by the grace of God.\nI said so at our time in the hospital to him and I am saying it again that Dr Pradeep Haranahalli  has the markings of a true doctor and he will surely make a name for him. I wish him all success from my heart.\n",

My father lives in Odisha, 83 years that time, had then undergone angioplasty in one of his arteries. The second artery needed rotablation, which the doctor in Bhubaneswar was hesitant to do. So I decided meet 3-4 famous cardiologists in Bangalore (Narayani Hridalaya, Manipal old airport rd) with my father's reports and take opinion. What struck me about Dr Pradeep is his silent confidence. He was through, made detailed notes, saw all the reports/CDs. He was confident that the proceedure can be safely done despite of old age. He clearly conveyed to us that age is not a factor in such surgeries. We liked his attitude because it was different from other doctors who discouraged us to try anything because of old age. (My father was fit otherwise). I was living in US that time where people drive till 88 years if they are healthy.\nWe decided to go with Doctor Pradeep because of his thoroughness, confidence, accessibility. In 2018 my father came down from Odisha and after check up was decided to implant pacemaker. Dr Pradeep took a special care, from admission till discharge. He himself was present with the nurses in all post -surgical processes. He was very patient with my father, in mobilizing him etc. Today my father has a big trust on him. He lives in Odisha and I moved to another country but we are in contact with Doctor Pradeep via phone, whatsapp on medicine doses, advice etc. We are fortunate to have met Dr Pradeep. We highly recommend others. He wants to genuinely help patients.  ",

He was having this known health issue in the past seven years but now the condition was bad and needed an immediate attention. Previously he was under assumption that he was having some minor leakage in heart for which he was already consuming tablets but without any significant outcome. By god's grace things fell in place just at the right time as we met Dr Pradeep.  He started diagnosing my father step by step from beginning through various tests. Very soon he arrived at the conclusion that my father is having some serious blockage in left main coronary artery that was causing the chest pain. He then called upon Dr. Vivek Babu Bojjawar, discussed the issue, and recommended to go for CABG procedure as the blockage was more than 70 percent and angioplasty stenting won't be successful. I am very much thankful to both Dr Pradeep and Dr Vivek who clearly explained me the current condition and also explained why CABG was necessary. They provided me adequate clinical information that helped me to confidently provide my consent for the CABG procedure. All went as per the schedule. The procedure was successfully carried out by Dr Vivek, Dr Pradeep and their expert team of doctors that took around 4 hours. In a week's time my father was discharged from hospital. In little more than a month he was fully recovered and back to normal. Now he is completely back to life. Just within 3 months of time lot many things have changed for good. To speak few words about Dr Pradeep, he is a very nice person who listened to all our concerns very carefully and provided his expert recommendation. A very highly responsible and approachable person who understands and respects patient's sentiments. ** *** *** **** ********* ** *** ***** *** quick enough in taking the right decision.

After waiting for more than an hour we got our change to visit the doctor since he did not come on time, he saw the reports and asked for another test done. we got the test done and went with reports. But refused to take a look at the reports until all the patients are done with consultation we were ok with that also, then he told us to sit in the consultation room and said he will be back in 2 mins but he came after 30 mins and said all the reports are fine. In this whole process he spent time with us is less than 10 mins and it took us 3 and 1/2 hours to wait. Its really a bad process to keep the elderly waiting for so long. If they think there are too many appointments why do they allow so many to book. ** *** *** *** **** **** ** ****** *** *** ***** *** ********* **** ************ **** *** ******* ********** ",

And the 2nd surprising thing was that when I asked them to connect with doctor. He also said the same thing and they have cancelled my appointment without asking me. I just went to show my cholestrol report and nothing else. Why should I pay consultation charge again for showing the report which was pending. Bit the doc denied straightly. It was said first pay 700 bucks and then enter the doc room.I already asked the doc that can I come after few days for cholesterol report as my office timing was not matching with my appointment. He was fine with it at that time. Very disappointed. And then I left the place. *** *** *** ** ******** ***",

Dr Pradeep helped us understand the severity of the situation from the get go and also suggested the necessary procedure which needed to be done for eliminating the problem. The Procedure was conducted at the earliest and was done hassle-free. \nDr Pradeep did not only eliminate the problem but was also approachable for every doubt, question or second thoughts we had in mind both in person and over phone as well. From the beginning of the treatment, we were made completely aware of the way things were unfolding and there was no moment of ambiguity regarding it. My father is doing well now and is living a normal life. We are very glad we met Dr Pradeep for my father's heart issue and that he is able to get back to his normal life now after treatment with a new vigor. ",

He took every possible care to treat my father in law and send him home in much better condition after doing his angioplasty flawlessly. Dr pradeep is not only a very good doctor but also a very good human who understands the emotional crisis of the patient and his family. He explained everything very clearly from day one and did not conduct any unnecessary tests also helped us to take my father in law home one day early which indirectly saved a handsome amount for us.\nThe best part of the doctor is he is always available over phone for any help or any advice required. In  case if he cannot take your call his assistant will and very surprisingly you can expect a call back from Dr Pradeep which was beyond our expectation from a busy doctor like him. \nAfter all i think he showed up as a blessing for us. I definitely 101% recommend him for any cardiology construction. ",

He is very calm, friendly, and a good listener. He understood our problem very clearly and even provided solutions effectively by considering health & finances. He also shared his WhatsApp number with us for any other clarification required, and he responded immediately. Above all, Dr. Pradeep Haranahalli is a great human being. He solved not only my father's health problem but also other health problems of my family, now he is our family doctor and also we treat him as our family member too. ",

My Dad is 65 and had went through a cardiac arrest last year and within 6 months from then he has been suffering from a major health issue ( non cardiac) , for which he had to go through another serious surgery which was not safe for him as he got a stent recently. First of all Dr. Pradeep guided and redirected us in the right diagnosis process, for which we are always grateful to him, and secondly I thank him for his relentless support and treatment throughout. His diagnosis , proper guidance and confidence have been keeping my Dad healthy and well. Also to mention, we were never been asked  for any kind of extra or unnecessary tests / procedures but were all genuine. He always listens to us very patiently and understands the issues and help on the concerns. We are happy to consult  doctor Pradeep out of thousands of cardiologists in Bangalore because choosing a right Doctor for your family is a difficult yet very important decision.\n\nI would recommend Dr. Pradeep to all the readers.\n\n\nThanks.",

Doctor did angioplasty successfully and my husband is 100% fine now.  He will never panic the patient and family  which is a very good character of a doctor. \n\nDr. Pradeep is a very soft spoken and gives sufficient time to his patients which is very rare in these days. Any time you call him for any clarifications, he is available/reachable on call. If he is busy, he will call back. Very caring Doctor.  If patient is in HDU, he will continously check with nurse about patients condition.  we got to hear very good feedback about him from Manipal nurses and staffs as well. He values for our money.\n\nDr. Pradeep Haranahalli is a real blessing to doctors field and for all of us.",

Dr. Pradeep really explains even the medication what he prescribed for what and why he had to do that. No unwanted tests or medicines. He takes complete care and gives the best possible solution that is the best any patient can get. It\u2019s not only during the operation even after that he asked us to stay back for one day extra to testify that stent is working fine.

He quickly diagnosed this as a complete heart block, and advised a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation to prevent any further untoward incidences. He was kind enough to understand our personal constraints and schedules and accommodated the surgery on the next day itself. As my father was a diabetic, Dr Pradeep took extra care to ensure infection prevention both before and after the surgery. For all his skills and capabilities, he is such a humble and approachable person, which made the overall experience so comfortable for all of us. Post surgery, my father's surgical wound didn't heal immediately due to his diabetes, and some other factors. Dr Pradeep followed up with us regularly and even additionally consulted with a plastic surgeon to ensure that my dad got the best of care - eventually resulting in his successful healing and recovery. To this date, he still texts us periodically to check on my father's health! Based on our extremely positive experience, I would highly recommend Dr. Pradeep, without reservations, to anyone with any kind of cardiac care needs. You will be in safe and caring hands for sure!",

But when the pain didn't subside for 2 days she said yes and we visited Manipal Hospital Whitefield branch(on 14th Feb 2019) thinking that it's due to some exertion or acidity. In hospital the general physician suggested a blood test and ECG. The ECG came abnormal and blood report also came positive which indicated that my mom was going through minor heart attack. By grace of God and our good luck that Dr. Pradeep was there in the cardiology department. He gave immediate attention and emergency medicines and started the treatment immediately. He suggested Angiogram and based on that angioplasty without wasting more time. After angiogram he narrated everything in detail that what's the problem and what treatment is required. He answered all our questions very patiently. There was blockage in the main artery. To remove blockage Angioplasty and stenting was done successfully by Dr. Pradeep. After the angioplasty procedure Dr. Pradeep was always in touch and available to  answer all our queries. Its been 2 months now and thanks to Dr. Pradeep my mom is fine and living normal life.  Dr.Pradeep is very down to earth, positive in nature, polite,  explain things well and listen to you patiently. Also he doesn't suggest unnecessary tests and believes in giving minimum medicines. I am grateful and highly recommend Dr. Pradeep. ",

He did angiogram to figure out problem. Explained the issue and did angioplasty. He also told pacemaker might be need as per report however symptoms are not present so not done anything. Symptoms started appearing from December 2017. I consulted dr again in April 2018. Checkup is done and found heart bit was missing for longer time and average beat is just around 35. So we went for pacemaker. It's done successfully on 9th Apr 2018. Pacemaker is working fine and my father is doing good. My father got harpis zoster which is identifies by Dr early so treatment could be done on right time. Harpis is very painful disease and my father is suffering from it. It will go for 1 to 2 months. Overall experience is excellent with Dr and feels very close to him. He is really friendly Dr gives time to people to make understand the problem. ",

We had decided to get it done by Dr Pradeep Haranahalli  due to his vast experience, excellent track-record and sound academics. Further Pradeep is one of few doctors who is proficient in performing minimally invasive surgeries. So got her admitted to State of art facility - Manipal Whitefield hospital. My mom was discharged within 3 days. It was absolutely painless for my mom and went exactly as the doctor had briefed us prior to the operation. She had no post surgery complications as Dr Pradeep was very patient and spent considerable time in repeatedly explaining the precautions that she should take post surgery.Based on our personal experience, We would recommend Dr Pradeep Haranahalli to anyone who needs to undergo similar surgery. Needless to say that you would be in very safe pair of hands with a doctor who is not only reliable but also analytical, thoughtful and caring.",

He is very understanding and listens to your concerns. He takes time with the patient to help them with their health issues.

I was convinced with the explanation. Dr. Pradeep is very patient in listening all the problems. Will explain the issues.  His treatment was really very good and saved my life. After that I am getting my parents also consulted with him for their heart related issues. I definitely recommend him for a genuine and correct treatment. He is very responsive for calls and even whatsapp, always quick in replying back. Any time reachable. \nI recommend him for:\nGood treatment\nResponsive\nGood attitude towards patients\nIssue explanations\nReachability\n",

Dr Pradeep had just finished his days work and was leaving, when my mother Kusum was brought to him as emergency patient, without any hitch and so much of patience, he attended to her and saw her condition, and decided to do various test and in parallel asked the OT and the staff to be ready as she had critical blocks. He took fast decision and as time was critical, he immediately performed the angioplasty and put stents. My mother is normally very scared of operation, but Dr Pradeep was so kind, humble and very friendly and highly knowledgeable, made this whole process Look very comfortable for her and us as  a family.\n\nI would highly recommend him for his safe hands, and his humility is really remarkable. I have built huge faith in him.\n\nI wish his great journey and pray for his well being and he is asset to our society.\n",

He provided alternate courses of treatments, after explaining the pros and cons of each.\n\nAfter a brief period of hospitalization, I got well and returned home. Dr. Pradeep followed-up on my case on his own, and offered valuable advice for my travel and resuming work.\n\nDr. Pradeep went above and beyond his call of duty, and made sure I'm put on the right and fastest path to recovery.\n\nEven a full year later, he provides objective, reliable and valuable advice.",

As she got admitted the same night, he kept his word and visited her in the HDU at late night. Over the next couple of days, I had numerous questions regarding the diagnosis, and he answered each one of those in detail. The comfort and confidence that he generated in us is highly commendable. We really felt assured that our case was in the right hands. I definitely recommended him. Thank you doc, please keep-up the good work. ",

He has shown great amount of patience in listening to whatever doubts/questions we had, and that was a big plus.We could see perfection in whatever instructions given and procedures done throughout the course of treatment.\nThe responsibility,interest and response shown by Dr. Pradeep is appreciated when my grandfather had to undergo multiple surgeries(due to non cardiology related issues) in the same hospital.\n\nWe felt that he is a person who considers his patients as the top priority.\nWe are really happy with doctor's friendliness and the overall approach he takes to any patient.",

Cardiologist at Narayana Health suggested to undergo stenting whereas cardiac surgeon at the same hospital advised that bypass surgery is the best option compared to stenting. This created complete confusion as which option to choose and which is apt in this particular situation considering the blockages  been in single blood vessel. At this point of time, we approached Dr Pradeep Haranahalli for second opinion.\n\nUnderstanding the dilemma we are with, Dr.Pradeep explained the case in detail and clarified all the queries.He revealed the strong reasons for choosing stenting as the best option in my father's case, which is very much convincing. Doctor's explanation, patience, friendliness and empathy he puts forward were awesome and extraordinary. Now a days you hardly find a doctor who listens to all the patient's queries and spends ample time in discussing with the patient.unlikely,Dr Pradeep spends ample time with the patient and addresses even simple questions with patience and compassion.I strongly recommend this doctor.",

I took my aunty Manipal Whitefield, when she complained about Chest pain.. took her to emergency.. after an hour or so after all pre checks.. Emergency doctors told me that they are consulting cardiology specificlist in this case. after some 20 mins I was called to cardiologist Dr Pradeep. He explained me with initial tests, he is guessing some issues in chest may be causing this pain and he has to do couple of more tests and may be have to do angioplasty if required. I signed for all the papers and aunty was shifted to HDU from emergency and again met Dr Pradeep in thr entry. he just told don't worry we will do thiss test and confirm how to go forward. after 2 hours of tests, he comes back and explains what could have happened and there are no issues observed in advanced tests. I was relieved, he explained me why was this additional tests were done. I was happy with great interaction of Dr Pradeep. God bless him and his family. Thank you sir.",

Our father undergone Cardiac Arrest @ 2014 and diagnosed with PTCA + Stenting to LAD since then he was on constant medication. We were never associated to one specific doctor as we use to just have an Annual Medical Check-up and consult Dr. accordingly, but when we met Dr. Pradeep in 2017, we were made very comfortable in sharing our Father's health conditions and history. Dr. had made notes on the important aspects of diagnosis which are being used as reference and case history. His Excellency in dealing with the Investigations and Test Reports is always an epitome. His recent medication changes helped our father to cope up difficulties in using multiple tablets. Reaching doctor either through email or phone is always at ease with Swift responses. We would like to Approach him for all our Father's future medical consultations without any mark of doubt. His Approach and comfort which he gives to patients makes a huge difference among the current generation Doctors and he always has a special epitome place.",

After supervising for 3-4 days my hubby was discharged and we had a follow up visit a week later.
