He saw that I was facing a life-threatening situation and he immediately recommended a stent procedure for me. He performed it on me as well. The procedure was a success. Thus he has given me a second life. Thereafter I have been under his supervision and have consulting him regularly (once in every 6 months or so). In these regular checkups, he has given a lot of valuable advise on several important health issues (most prominently how to keep my Diabetes under control). During my recent visit, he also recommended me an ECG and Echo tests once again (after nearly 3 years). When he saw the reports, I could finally see a great smile and a great sense of satisfaction on his face - which tells a great story. Dr. Sandesh Prabhu is no doubt a very great doctor. I am extremely happy to have been operated upon by him and am really grateful to him for all the valuable advise he has given. Apart from being a great doctor, he is also a very wonderful human being as well. I would be very happy to recommend him to anyone who needs to consult a specialist with regards to Diabetes and Cardiology related issues.\n\nOnce again, a great many thanks to Dr. Sandesh Prabhu for the wonderful treatment. A great many thanks also to Manipal Hospital (Whitefield).\n\nRegards,\nRavindranath",

But with his presence during the tests I felt safe. \n\nIn the end I am grateful for the time invested in me and my health - his advice I\u2019ll take upon strongly. \n\nHe asked me to visit after 6M.

He saw that I was facing a life-threatening situation and he immediately recommended a stent procedure for me. He performed it on me as well. The procedure was a success. Thus he has given me a second life. Thereafter I have been under his supervision and have consulting him regularly (once in every 6 months or so). In these regular checkups, he has given a lot of valuable advise on several important health issues (most prominently how to keep my Diabetes under control). During my recent visit, he also recommended me an ECG and Echo tests once again (after nearly 3 years). When he saw the reports, I could finally see a great smile and a great sense of satisfaction on his face - which tells a great story. Dr. Sandesh Prabhu is no doubt a very great doctor. I am extremely happy to have been operated upon by him and am really grateful to him for all the valuable advise he has given. Apart from being a great doctor, he is also a very wonderful human being as well. I would be very happy to recommend him to anyone who needs to consult a specialist with regards to Diabetes and Cardiology related issues.\n\nOnce again, a great many thanks to Dr. Sandesh Prabhu for the wonderful treatment. A great many thanks also to Manipal Hospital (Whitefield).\n\nRegards,\nRavindranath",

But with his presence during the tests I felt safe. \n\nIn the end I am grateful for the time invested in me and my health - his advice I\u2019ll take upon strongly. \n\nHe asked me to visit after 6M. This I shall do no matter which part of the country I shall be present in. \n\nThank you Dr. Sandesh :)",
