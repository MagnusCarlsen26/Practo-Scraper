I am writing this review on behalf of my family and a context is required hence a lengthy review.\nMy mother in law MALLIHA,65Y had complained of breathlessness last year in August. She stays in Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu with her husband. She was admitted to the nearest hospital where her diagnosis said 90 percent blockage in 2 arteries in heart. She was advised to undergo a double angioplasty, which she did but after a mere 50 days she got a major attack. During the probe it was found that one of the arteries was ruptured during the angioplasty procedure and only a bypass could make her survive.\n\nWe, helplessly called multiple hospitals in Bangalore to get an appointment, you name it  - Narayana Hrudalaya said no appointment for 15 days, Fortis didn't reach out to us on time while we tried long queues in call centers, and Apollo gave a delayed response saying it would cost 10 lakhs+ and only if you say yes we can make the arrangements.\n\nManipal was the only hospital where we were able to at least speak to the doctor directly. Thankfully we reached out to Dr. Lalchand Bandagi on time. During our first video call consultation he assured us if we can bring her to the hospital by the next day or two he will perform the surgery asap. He was quick enough to study her reports and spoke to us in a way that made us believe she can survive. We brought her overnight in ambulance all the way from Tirunelveli to Manipal. And on the same day her bypass was done, it was a 5 hour long surgery. Dr. Lalchand  literally saved her from misery, actually all of us. It was a very complicated surgery and the entire team was on it. His reviews and availability even after months of the procedure was impeccable. The smile on his face and hand on our shoulder made us believe that there is hope. He was so hopeful. We would recommend Dr. Lalchand and the hospital any day. Our entire family was going through so much and he was indeed a ray of hope for all of us.",
