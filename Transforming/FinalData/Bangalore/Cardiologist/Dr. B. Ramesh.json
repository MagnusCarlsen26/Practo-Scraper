Ramesh is a living god on earth who helped me to recover from problems related to heart.\r\nI surely recommend this doctor for patients suffering from heart problems.\r\nHe is very down to earth and makes patients feel very much comfortable during his consultation.\r\nNot like other diagnostic places, here this Doctor sits along with the Radiologist in order to diagnose the problems. This is a great advantage in his clinic.\r\nHe gives huge hopes which are more necessary for recovery instead of actual medicines.\r\nLet me explain my story.. I had suffered from palpitations and breathlessness and i was wrongly diagnosed with \"Rheumatic heart disease\" by a big hospital in Bangalore. Because of this shock i could'nt sleep for 15 days and also the palpitations used to occur frequently. Thanks to Practo.com from where i could get the contact of Dr.B.Ramesh.\r\nI have been under the care of this doctor from past 3 months and i have almost recovered from my health problems. This doctor has huge experience and he has got the knack of diagnosing patients just with Stethoscope.  He initially diagnosed me just with  his stethoscope and said to me \"You don't have Rheumatic heart disease :) \". These words bought me great relief, self confidence and made me very happy. Then later i was taken to ECO scan room and the doctor explained me clearly what the exact issue is and what is causing all the palpitations and breathlessness symptoms.\r\nI have huge confidence on this doctor and i feel myself that nothing bad is going to happen to me since Dr.B.Ramesh is always there for me to take care of my health.\r\nI am now back to my normal activities and i am able to concentrate more on my work. \r\nDoctor has given me the confidence that i can eat anything, i can go for trekking, and as usual continue with my normal day to day activities.\r\nMany times i have visited his clinic and many times he has advised his receptionist not to collect fees from me. \r\nMy hats off to his dedication and service to mankind. Long live this doctor so that many suffering patients can be cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He had undergone ECG, ECHO and TMT tests wherein the previous doctor had suspected a blockage in heart and recommended to perform angiogram test followed by angioplasty. We were extremely tensed as my father is a very active person and we did not expect something like this to show up suddenly hence we thought of having a second opinion by one of the leading cardiologists in Bangalore i.e. Dr. Ramesh and  no doubt whatsoever when people term him as a Living God. He is extremely down to earth and very humble in nature. He listens to you very patiently and examines you carefully. He checked my father using his stethoscope and went through his reports stating Sir, you are absolutely fine and you do not require my services.. these words were so reassuring for all of us and we were left teary eyed but these tears were of joy and happiness as doctor mentioned that no further tests or surgery is required and that my father can carry on with his regular routine. I am very glad that I was able to find out Dr.Ramesh through Practo and hence my special thanks to the Practo team.",

So my problem is with Dr Ramesh Lady assistant and partially with the respected doctor too. I went with my dad inside the cabin at that moment some emergency come up so doctor left for emergency Ward(I was not knowing, assistant told me later)  ,so mean while lady assistance asked me required question I gave all the answers politely ,then she told us to go and do ECG and ECO and come back,  I said ma'am we are here for consultation as after putting stent I wanted him(dad) to see a doctor because there are some issues he is facing like cough and allergies nothing else.also now onwards whether we go to General physician for regular checkup or not. can we see the doctor and then we plan accordingly. Rudely,  she told \"OK go and wait out side\" doctor  will come later as he is occupied, I asked \"how long I have to wait ma'am\",  \"need time \" her answer. I asked can u be specific as, if my dad case is not a cardio problem then I need to see general physicia too. Then she said \"OK wait for 15-20 min I'll call you. \nDoctor came,  he asked what is the issue patient facing ? Told all of them whatever I said to Lady assist,  then they did whatever they need to, then while Leaving Dr.  Ramesh said \" don't be restless we have lot of other patients to check\",  so told him clearly \"what so ever been communicated to you was wrongly misinterpreted, I never asked I want to meet doctor immediately,  I clearly said I can wait if I know how long I have to\".\nNow tell me someone when I was restless and when did I said I want to meet Doc asap. \nAs he is very senior doc, I don't want to create any nuisance, didn't say anything further and left. \n** ******* ******** *** *** ****** **** **** ***** ***** *** ** **** * **** ",

He reviewed my previous test reports and then started his diagnosis. \nBased on physical examination, ECG, TMT test and also considering my previous test reports he mentioned to me that I have no heart related issues and I must not unnecessarily worry about the pain I am getting. The root cause of my chest pain was not established in this consultation, but he being a cardiologist, assured me that the pain I am getting is not related to heart, which I was more concerned about. He made me comfortable, provided me with much needed confidence that I have no heart related issues. He advised me to think positively, eat healthy and do regular exercise.\nOverall, it was a very nice experience at his clinic. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Ramesh, THANK YOU Sir.\nI will recommend Dr.Ramesh for anyone who needs cardiology consultation.\n",

My father was suffering from breathlessness and was under treatment under various other doctors but with no improvement. \nHe was suffering from Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Doctor Ramesh very well explained us the problem by drawing the diagram of heart on a paper and helped us understand the various treatment options available. He also encouraged us to enlighten ourselves by reading the pros and cons of one of the surgery option available to us (Alcohol Septal Ablation). There was an other surgery option as well but that was a major open heart surgery. So we stick to Alcohol Septal Ablation as the doctor suggested my father will benefit from it. He carefully performed surgery on my father which significantly reduced the muscle thickness (LVOT Gradient) and the symptoms. Now my father is feeling very well.\nI would suggest everyone reading my review that Doctor B Ramesh is a really very good doctor with huge experience and you must visit him for your cardiac issues. He is professor and various doctors work under him to learn. I also went to him by reading various online reviews as well as on suggestion of my friend.",

Doctor suggested to take ECG and ECHO and finally doctor told that there is no problem with your heart your heart is healthy :). Still I don't know the exact reason of my pain, as per doctor's comment it is because I am over weight!\n\nThank you very much doctor and I really appreciate your dedication and service to mankind.

Ramesh is a living god on earth who helped me to recover from problems related to heart.\r\nI surely recommend this doctor for patients suffering from heart problems.\r\nHe is very down to earth and makes patients feel very much comfortable during his consultation.\r\nNot like other diagnostic places, here this Doctor sits along with the Radiologist in order to diagnose the problems. This is a great advantage in his clinic.\r\nHe gives huge hopes which are more necessary for recovery instead of actual medicines.\r\nLet me explain my story.. I had suffered from palpitations and breathlessness and i was wrongly diagnosed with \"Rheumatic heart disease\" by a big hospital in Bangalore. Because of this shock i could'nt sleep for 15 days and also the palpitations used to occur frequently. Thanks to Practo.com from where i could get the contact of Dr.B.Ramesh.\r\nI have been under the care of this doctor from past 3 months and i have almost recovered from my health problems. This doctor has huge experience and he has got the knack of diagnosing patients just with Stethoscope.  He initially diagnosed me just with  his stethoscope and said to me \"You don't have Rheumatic heart disease :) \". These words bought me great relief, self confidence and made me very happy. Then later i was taken to ECO scan room and the doctor explained me clearly what the exact issue is and what is causing all the palpitations and breathlessness symptoms.\r\nI have huge confidence on this doctor and i feel myself that nothing bad is going to happen to me since Dr.B.Ramesh is always there for me to take care of my health.\r\nI am now back to my normal activities and i am able to concentrate more on my work. \r\nDoctor has given me the confidence that i can eat anything, i can go for trekking, and as usual continue with my normal day to day activities.\r\nMany times i have visited his clinic and many times he has advised his receptionist not to collect fees from me. \r\nMy hats off to his dedication and service to mankind. Long live this doctor so that many suffering patients can be cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He had undergone ECG, ECHO and TMT tests wherein the previous doctor had suspected a blockage in heart and recommended to perform angiogram test followed by angioplasty. We were extremely tensed as my father is a very active person and we did not expect something like this to show up suddenly hence we thought of having a second opinion by one of the leading cardiologists in Bangalore i.e. Dr. Ramesh and  no doubt whatsoever when people term him as a Living God. He is extremely down to earth and very humble in nature. He listens to you very patiently and examines you carefully. He checked my father using his stethoscope and went through his reports stating Sir, you are absolutely fine and you do not require my services.. these words were so reassuring for all of us and we were left teary eyed but these tears were of joy and happiness as doctor mentioned that no further tests or surgery is required and that my father can carry on with his regular routine. I am very glad that I was able to find out Dr.Ramesh through Practo and hence my special thanks to the Practo team.",

So my problem is with Dr Ramesh Lady assistant and partially with the respected doctor too. I went with my dad inside the cabin at that moment some emergency come up so doctor left for emergency Ward(I was not knowing, assistant told me later)  ,so mean while lady assistance asked me required question I gave all the answers politely ,then she told us to go and do ECG and ECO and come back,  I said ma'am we are here for consultation as after putting stent I wanted him(dad) to see a doctor because there are some issues he is facing like cough and allergies nothing else.also now onwards whether we go to General physician for regular checkup or not. can we see the doctor and then we plan accordingly. Rudely,  she told \"OK go and wait out side\" doctor  will come later as he is occupied, I asked \"how long I have to wait ma'am\",  \"need time \" her answer. I asked can u be specific as, if my dad case is not a cardio problem then I need to see general physicia too. Then she said \"OK wait for 15-20 min I'll call you. \nDoctor came,  he asked what is the issue patient facing ? Told all of them whatever I said to Lady assist,  then they did whatever they need to, then while Leaving Dr.  Ramesh said \" don't be restless we have lot of other patients to check\",  so told him clearly \"what so ever been communicated to you was wrongly misinterpreted, I never asked I want to meet doctor immediately,  I clearly said I can wait if I know how long I have to\".\nNow tell me someone when I was restless and when did I said I want to meet Doc asap. \nAs he is very senior doc, I don't want to create any nuisance, didn't say anything further and left. \n** ******* ******** *** *** ****** **** **** ***** ***** *** ** **** * **** ",

He reviewed my previous test reports and then started his diagnosis. \nBased on physical examination, ECG, TMT test and also considering my previous test reports he mentioned to me that I have no heart related issues and I must not unnecessarily worry about the pain I am getting. The root cause of my chest pain was not established in this consultation, but he being a cardiologist, assured me that the pain I am getting is not related to heart, which I was more concerned about. He made me comfortable, provided me with much needed confidence that I have no heart related issues. He advised me to think positively, eat healthy and do regular exercise.\nOverall, it was a very nice experience at his clinic. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Ramesh, THANK YOU Sir.\nI will recommend Dr.Ramesh for anyone who needs cardiology consultation.\n",

My father was suffering from breathlessness and was under treatment under various other doctors but with no improvement. \nHe was suffering from Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Doctor Ramesh very well explained us the problem by drawing the diagram of heart on a paper and helped us understand the various treatment options available. He also encouraged us to enlighten ourselves by reading the pros and cons of one of the surgery option available to us (Alcohol Septal Ablation). There was an other surgery option as well but that was a major open heart surgery. So we stick to Alcohol Septal Ablation as the doctor suggested my father will benefit from it. He carefully performed surgery on my father which significantly reduced the muscle thickness (LVOT Gradient) and the symptoms. Now my father is feeling very well.\nI would suggest everyone reading my review that Doctor B Ramesh is a really very good doctor with huge experience and you must visit him for your cardiac issues. He is professor and various doctors work under him to learn. I also went to him by reading various online reviews as well as on suggestion of my friend.",

Doctor suggested to take ECG and ECHO and finally doctor told that there is no problem with your heart your heart is healthy :). Still I don't know the exact reason of my pain, as per doctor's comment it is because I am over weight!\n\nThank you very much doctor and I really appreciate your dedication and service to mankind. Long live this doctor so that many suffering patients can be cured.\n\nGod bless you doctor!",

The doctor thoroughly examined all my previous reports (blood test, x-ray etc..) and suggested for ECG and ECHO, which was carried out at the same facility, and throughout the process, the doctor was standing beside and calming me down.\n\nFinally the after the evaluation of the ECG and ECHO reports, he advised that there are no abnormalities and need not to seek any further medications or investigations.I had a huge sigh of relief at that moment. \n\nThe doctor is a skilled professional and a warm human being. I highly recommend him.",

I owe my life to Dr. B Ramesh who attended to me at short notice at Apollo Hospital, BG Road, Bangalore on the midnight of Christmas in 2014 when I suffered a severe AMI.  He rushed to the hospital at the midnight hour and conducted multiple angioplast procedures with insertion of 3 stents.  He gives simple life-style management advise too & I am fortunate to be under his treatment & care.  He has been a messiah to thousands of cardiac patients like me.   God bless Dr. B Ramesh !",

A doctor should make the patient comfortable, and kind words should help family to breathe in relief.. Dr. Ramesh is one such doctor.. we have been consulting him for more than 5 yrs for any regular consultation or cardiac related consultations for our entire family. all the required treatment or tests are available at his clinic only. we went to consult him in tension. The way he guided and treated was very good.. we were overwhelmed and we got relief after consulting him. Words are less to describe his work. Thank you so much Sir.. ",

He mentioned that I was recovering well and asked me to have my ECG and ECHO done.\r\nOnce my results were with him he assured me that I had nothing to worry about(provided I don't go back to my old style of living). \r\nTold me that I shouldn't worry about what happened in the past and get married and start living a normal life.\r\nComing to prescribing medicines he cut down my medicines from 3 to 1.\r\nAll in all my experience with him was extraordinary(I don't like doctors much, who does right?)\r\nI felt like I was visiting a family member and not just a doctor.",
