I should have left before I took the test itself but I just went along with it because I was exhausted. Also visited the washroom to get a urine sample and it was horrible. Clinics need to be clean and hygienic and this is not done. The blood tests also seemed more expensive than other places. I complained to the doctor later about the unhygienic conditions of the room and toilet, and he said he would look into it. I hope they do for the sake of their patients. ",

The nurse took my blood sample in an unhygienic, cluttered room, and at one point I saw the needle touch the dusty table. I should have left before I took the test itself but I just went along with it because I was exhausted. Also visited the washroom to get a urine sample and it was horrible. Clinics need to be clean and hygienic and this is not done. The blood tests also seemed more expensive than other places. I complained to the doctor later about the unhygienic conditions of the room and toilet, and he said he would look into it. I hope they do for the sake of their patients. ",
