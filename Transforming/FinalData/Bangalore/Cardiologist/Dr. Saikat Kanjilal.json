As part of health check, I was adviced that I might start seeing symptoms after few years but can be easily resolved if we take care right away. \nDr. Saikat prescribed me every advanced test there is, totaling nearly Rs. 40000. I am overweight and the health check found that I had diabetes. He said he wants to baseline my organs since my BP was high when I visited him (though my BP was fine in the healthcheck). He also said that he cannot decide whether I have hypertension just by the two readings we took in his office, hence he wants to look at all the results before giving BP medicine. He ordered renal doplar, sleep study, some 24 hour urine test that costs 12000, etc. ** ****** **** ********** ********* *** *** **** * *** * ****** *********** **** *** ********* *** *** ******* ** **** ** ** *** ******* ****** *** **** ** **** ************ *** ***** ****** Once I knew the cost and I cancelled the appointments, the helper called and said she can offer 35% off. **** ***** ** ******* ******* *** * ****** *** ****** ****** **** ** ****** ****** ***** ******** *** **** ** *** ***** **** * ***** ***** ****** *** ****.
