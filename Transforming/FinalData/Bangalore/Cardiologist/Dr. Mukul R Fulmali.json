I was perfectly alright and went to sleep by around 2:30 am at around 3:30 am I had a discomfort in my chest and went to the washroom. I collapsed there only to regain consciousness after a good 10 min Or so. Knowing this was not a good sign I rushed to the nearby hospital and got admitted. I was told I would need to be referred to another hospital as the Dr ( Dr Mukul) is on leave from the next day. I told them I am not sure if I will make it if they do that. Dr Mukul wad informed and he decided to cancel his leave and come down(I still admire him for his dedication). In about half an hour I meet this young Dr who had taken the control of the OT and was proceeding to get an angeoplasty on me. The curious me kept asking him doubts and he snubbed me in a very friendly *** ****** * ** **** ****** ***** ****** **** *** *** there on the operation table after that friendly banter I was laughing even while fighting to survive. He is the sweetest Dr I have met so far who built a very cordial relationship with me post treatment. He took out the time to sit and hear through all my problems something he could have easily avoided. My heart attack happened just three days before my birthday so i made sure to cut my bday cake with him in the hospital \ud83d\ude0a guess now over the period of three months we have matured to being good friends than being just a Dr for a patient! Definitely recommend him for heart ailments if you wish to have a personal touch to your treatment. Wish him all the very best. ",

I rushed to the CMH hospital , that is closest from my place. Got admitted and was stable by early morning. Dr M R Fulmali was my assigned consultant cardiologist. I had no reference of his name or any research on the web. Also since I was not having any severe symptoms, I was a skeptic whether I indeed had a cardiac event , having heard tons of stories of corporate hospitals.\nDr Fulmali, spoke to me exactly 4 sentences when he saw me and infact the very first one he talked to me , got me hooked on. \n\" You may choose to be in a state of denial or accept the fact that you have a cardiac event. Though stabilized now, medicinal intervention has got you the stability so as a true friend and consultant I will advice you to get an angiogram asap and decide the further course of action. I will be the first person to allow you to go if the angiogram clears the doubts\". This set the record straight. I then agreed to angiography and went thru angioplasty and understood how timely the advice was. \nI truly appreciate Dr Fulmali's consultation on multiple grounds\n- Very open and direct communication with clarity of positives and negatives.\n- clarity of urgency or how to approach if not urgent\n- he was very empathetic to the family members and agreed to discussions with them , wants the patient to be convinced rather than accept under ambiguity. He made my family more comfortable before I agreed to the procedure.\n- Was very confident and took the pressure away of the procedure from me with the dialogue.\n- The sense of commitment as he establishes into the ranks of the best of cardiologists, were evident thru all the interactions.\n\nI will recommend Dr Fulmali for a trusted consultation\n",

I was perfectly alright and went to sleep by around 2:30 am at around 3:30 am I had a discomfort in my chest and went to the washroom. I collapsed there only to regain consciousness after a good 10 min Or so. Knowing this was not a good sign I rushed to the nearby hospital and got admitted. I was told I would need to be referred to another hospital as the Dr ( Dr Mukul) is on leave from the next day. I told them I am not sure if I will make it if they do that. Dr Mukul wad informed and he decided to cancel his leave and come down(I still admire him for his dedication). In about half an hour I meet this young Dr who had taken the control of the OT and was proceeding to get an angeoplasty on me. The curious me kept asking him doubts and he snubbed me in a very friendly *** ****** * ** **** ****** ***** ****** **** *** *** there on the operation table after that friendly banter I was laughing even while fighting to survive. He is the sweetest Dr I have met so far who built a very cordial relationship with me post treatment. He took out the time to sit and hear through all my problems something he could have easily avoided. My heart attack happened just three days before my birthday so i made sure to cut my bday cake with him in the hospital \ud83d\ude0a guess now over the period of three months we have matured to being good friends than being just a Dr for a patient! Definitely recommend him for heart ailments if you wish to have a personal touch to your treatment. Wish him all the very best. ",

I rushed to the CMH hospital , that is closest from my place. Got admitted and was stable by early morning. Dr M R Fulmali was my assigned consultant cardiologist. I had no reference of his name or any research on the web. Also since I was not having any severe symptoms, I was a skeptic whether I indeed had a cardiac event , having heard tons of stories of corporate hospitals.\nDr Fulmali, spoke to me exactly 4 sentences when he saw me and infact the very first one he talked to me , got me hooked on. \n\" You may choose to be in a state of denial or accept the fact that you have a cardiac event. Though stabilized now, medicinal intervention has got you the stability so as a true friend and consultant I will advice you to get an angiogram asap and decide the further course of action. I will be the first person to allow you to go if the angiogram clears the doubts\". This set the record straight. I then agreed to angiography and went thru angioplasty and understood how timely the advice was. \nI truly appreciate Dr Fulmali's consultation on multiple grounds\n- Very open and direct communication with clarity of positives and negatives.\n- clarity of urgency or how to approach if not urgent\n- he was very empathetic to the family members and agreed to discussions with them , wants the patient to be convinced rather than accept under ambiguity. He made my family more comfortable before I agreed to the procedure.\n- Was very confident and took the pressure away of the procedure from me with the dialogue.\n- The sense of commitment as he establishes into the ranks of the best of cardiologists, were evident thru all the interactions.\n\nI will recommend Dr Fulmali for a trusted consultation\n",
