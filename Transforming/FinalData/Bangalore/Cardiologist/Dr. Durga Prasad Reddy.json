We havemet  with few more doctors but none could give us a confidence which sir  gave us when  we met him. He immediately took up the case, and he said he would perform the surgery. Doctor is extremely approachable through the our stay at the hospital. Even for minute to minute things he gives attention An great and excellent guide for his students and patients and even the approach to Dr and his team was very positive. I would highly recommend Dr Durga Prasad Sir to anyone.",

My Name is Debkamal Roy and My Father Pradip Roy had his 2nd heart attack in January 2023. the 1st One has happened in April 2022 and the second really made us panic and was highly concerned. My father was in bad condition and he was having heavy shortness of breath. One of my friend guided us to Dr. Durgaprasad Reddy of Vydehi Hospital and we have immediately flown down to Bangalore and consulted him in his OPD. The moment i have seen him and discussed with him I got high confidence and felt like half of the problems are solved. Based on Dr. Durgaprasad's advise we have immediately admitted him for CABG-( Bye-pass Surgery). Seeing my worried face Dr. Durgaprasad has given me guarantee that he will make my father alrite. That statement has given lots of confidence and we were so much relaxed. LAter Dr. Durgaprasad Has performed the operation and Post surgery he met us and informed that My Father is out of the danger. My father is very fine now and has recovered from the issues he had. I want to take this oppurtunityt o THANK DR. DURGAPRASAD REDDY for his treatment and support. Sir, Let me tell you that  I Could see the GOD in you. Thank You!",
