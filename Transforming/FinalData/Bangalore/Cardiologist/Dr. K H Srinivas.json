It was a very complicated case as my husband has very bad lungs and his oxygen reserve was very low.  His value also was severely calcified and needed immediate replacement.   Doctor has given him a fresh lease of life by handling the surgery so well, for which we are forever thankful. I can understand the kind of stress and  pressure he and his team underwent while handling the surgery.  \nI must thank all the doctors in his team and the health care workers who helped by husband get thru it.\nI am really grateful to God to have sent us to you Dr.Srinivasa for my husband's treatment.  *Thank you* are very little words for the great job the he has done.  I am at loss of words to express my gratitude.  \nMan of few words but with a big heart \u2764\ufe0f.\nI pray God to him good health and happiness and the strength to you to help many more people who are in need of his services.\nA BIG THANK YOU DOC\ud83d\ude4f\nMay your tribe increase.",
