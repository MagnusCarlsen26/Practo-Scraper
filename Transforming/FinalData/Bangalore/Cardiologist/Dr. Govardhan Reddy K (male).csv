"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Heart Conditions,",0,0,YES,"The campus is pretty clean and decent . It’s a new clinic . Small pharmacy is also there . Doctor heard my mother in greater detail . She spoke to him in mother tongue . Doctor checked throughly, gave medical advice and asked  to avoid certain tests ( though I suggested to write)  as they are not needed and gave his personal number in case of emergency . Doctor’s residence is just behind the clinic. So, he said he can attend asap.  Doctor Govardhan ( cardiac surgeon at Narayana hrudayalaya) is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable person .  I feel much better after 1 week of using the meds and following his advice . My mother had  her ECG done there and the doctors wife also spoke to me . She handles gynaecology ( at Rainbow hospitals) and she gave good advice for my mother though I didn’t take Gynic consultation .  Happy to choose this clinic and would be my family docs going forward . Online payments accepted and the whole process is seamless. 
Thanks a ton ans Best wishes to the Docs . ",2021-02-07 02:03:02,False,True,Bala Subramanyam K,Thank you,2021-02-08T10:39:17+0000,Dr. Govardhan Reddy K
,,0,0,YES,"Having undergone a regular master health check up (including a TMT test) The results consisted of a certain ambiguity and I was in complete stress. During this time, we visited Dr. Govardhan and he spent a considerable amount of time taking us through complete functioning details of the heart with requisite films etc. He recommended that I take another test which would clear all my anxiety. Well it didn’t disappoint and I am now leading a happy and healthy life.

Dr. Govardhan is very humble & professional practitioner who invests his quality time to detail the potential health issues with possible solutions. He is approachable and available at any given time either through phone or whatsapp. Mother and heart care clinic has all the facilities and most of the basic investigations are carried out here saving us the hassle of going around which in my opinion saves a lot of time and effort.
