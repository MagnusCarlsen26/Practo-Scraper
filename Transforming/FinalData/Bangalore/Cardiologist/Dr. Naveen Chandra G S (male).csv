Today, my mother has shed all that excess fluid and is on a steady dose of medicines. Her quality of life has improved, thanks to Dr.Naveen Chandra.

I very strongly recommend Dr Naveen Chandra. His calming demenaour immediately put my mother at ease. He genuinely listened to everything that my mother had to say and did not belittle any of her complaints.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Coronary Angioplasty / Bypass Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My father had pain in the shoulder for more than one day. We took him to the hospital and met a general physician. The general physician inquired my father and adviced us to take ECG which revealed abnormality in heart functioning. She immediately called Dr. Naveen to look into the condition.

Dr. Naveen immediately started the treatment and immediately arranged for angiogram. I told doctor to take into consideration that my father has high serum creatinine level. After looking at the history, he told me that usage of dye for angio should be as minimal as possible for patients with kidney disease, otherwise it will be a big overload on kidneys and would cause kidney failure. Once the angiogram had been completed, he explained that there were two blocks. One was 100% and the other one 80%. He mentioned that 100% block should be removed first and the other one can be treated later. He also explained the severity of the block showing how the block is stopping the main blood flow and how other arteries are compensating the blood flow in the cath lab. He recommended us to go for an immediate angioplasty, as there is no other option. 

Once we gave him our go ahead, he performed angioplasty and it required one stenting also. The whole procedure took around 45 minutes and it was successful. After the procedure, he showed me how the blood became normal after angioplasty and stenting.

We have been following up with doctor after the procedure and very recently we have done the second angioplasty&stenting for my father to remove the second block and he has been doing well.

One thing I want to highlight is that the doctor is available on whatsapp and phone call and provides advice and guidance in case of any queries anytime. He has responded to all my queries till date. Once my father was hospitalized in a different city, I called up the doctor, explained the symptoms and shared reports. He had gone through all the reports and provided directions and advices. That was really helpful in managing the situation. 

I highly recommend Dr. Naveen for consultation related to heart diseases. He is very friendly, explains the issues clearly and approachable. ***** ** ** ******** ********** * ***** *** ** ** *** ** *** **** ******* * **** *** ** ****
