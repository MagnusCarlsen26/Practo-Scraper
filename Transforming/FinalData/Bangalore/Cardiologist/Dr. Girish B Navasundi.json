I was surprised to see such down to earth highly qualified doctors with an everlasting smile. 30% of the fear due to the illness of my dad got vanished merely by seeing the greeting smiles of them. He saved my father's Life and minimized the risk related to heart like a God. In a condition, where other Hospitals were either suggesting By Pass Surgeries or not willing to operate the Left side of the Heart by Angioplasty, Dr. Girish took extra effort to operate all the narrowing in both side of the Heart including Roto with great difficulty, patience & effort. I was overwhelmed by his gesture when he greeted me & consoled me with belief & faith with the success of the operation before entering the Operation theatre. After 2 hours of operation, when he came out, even before washing his hands, he waved me from inside to make me feel safe & secure. From him, my father might be just a patient but he understood the pain I have been going through that 2 hours. The Operation is successful. Today, My Dad is recovering well and rapid. Thank you so much, Doctor!!",

I was surprised to see such down to earth highly qualified doctors with an everlasting smile. 30% of the fear due to the illness of my dad got vanished merely by seeing the greeting smiles of them. He saved my father's Life and minimized the risk related to heart like a God. In a condition, where other Hospitals were either suggesting By Pass Surgeries or not willing to operate the Left side of the Heart by Angioplasty, Dr. Girish took extra effort to operate all the narrowing in both side of the Heart including Roto with great difficulty, patience & effort. I was overwhelmed by his gesture when he greeted me & consoled me with belief & faith with the success of the operation before entering the Operation theatre. After 2 hours of operation, when he came out, even before washing his hands, he waved me from inside to make me feel safe & secure. From him, my father might be just a patient but he understood the pain I have been going through that 2 hours. The Operation is successful. Today, My Dad is recovering well and rapid. Thank you so much, Doctor!!",
