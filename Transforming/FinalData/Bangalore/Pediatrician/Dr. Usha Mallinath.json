We had consulted quite a few doctors prior to visiting her . She was referred by our Pediatrician . We immediately booked an appointment and visited her . First impression itself was very pleasant.  she is highly profession and very composed person. She made us feel very comfortable. Doctor is highly respectful for her patients . She very clearly listened to us and went through all the tests which were done . She spoke to the child and child was also allowed to express herself. We were really amazed with her approach . Very rarely we had seen doctors being so Methodical. She is quite friendly with kids and our child soon felt very comfortable with her and started expressing her problems. Later she checked the child completely . She very clearly explained to us as what could be the possible reasons for the problems. We did few tests which were suggested . Again very clearly explained the reasoning for doing the test. We did MRI Brain at Hospital .Medicines were started . A detailed description of medicines and possible side effects were mentioned too. \n\nShe is very transparent and clear in her approach. Doesnt promise false outcomes and results . Medicines were started . We are also getting regular Physiotherapy at Hospital as suggested by Doctor .We have come for regular follow ups . Our child slowly has shown tremendous improvement. Every visit she speaks to the child as well to know the progress and issues. Slowly all the problems were taken care off and child is able to walk well now with no abnormal movements .Medicines have been slowly taken off and stopped now. Our child is back to what she was before .\nWe were very worried about our child but the way Dr Usha has managed her is highly commendable . Our Daughter will be looking forward to meet her . Feels very happy to see such doctors who are Highly Professional , Young  and friendly . She is an Inspiration to kids . Our daughter says she would want to be like her .\n\nThough our child is back to normal now , we visit her once in few months\nShe is very professional  pleasant and friendly Doctor \n\nOur child is doing well\nHighly Recommended\nOnce again we would like to Thank Dr usha Mallinath and Manipal Hospital \n\n",

That was a positive reinforcement for our son . we were given ample information about the condition , the possible causes and need to do relevant investigations. we followed all her advice . \n\nThere is so much thought process involved that Doctor was so mindful that all these were not discussed in the presence of child so that child is not affected Psychologically \nShe used to check the child regularly and update us about the condition . we were given all the information about the medications being used .Treatment was started and to our surprise the child showed tremendous improvement and started walking slowly and after 3 days child started walking . \nShe is a doctor with Integrity and Professionalism . She gives good insight into the problem and there is no false information . This really helps to cope up with situation .\nShe is highly inspirational for kids too . Dr Usha Mallinath is an Wonderful Pediatric Neurologist .Highly recommended to visit for kids Brain related Problems . we had a great experience with doctor .

We had consulted quite a few doctors prior to visiting her . She was referred by our Pediatrician . We immediately booked an appointment and visited her . First impression itself was very pleasant.  she is highly profession and very composed person. She made us feel very comfortable. Doctor is highly respectful for her patients . She very clearly listened to us and went through all the tests which were done . She spoke to the child and child was also allowed to express herself. We were really amazed with her approach . Very rarely we had seen doctors being so Methodical. She is quite friendly with kids and our child soon felt very comfortable with her and started expressing her problems. Later she checked the child completely . She very clearly explained to us as what could be the possible reasons for the problems. We did few tests which were suggested . Again very clearly explained the reasoning for doing the test. We did MRI Brain at Hospital .Medicines were started . A detailed description of medicines and possible side effects were mentioned too. \n\nShe is very transparent and clear in her approach. Doesnt promise false outcomes and results . Medicines were started . We are also getting regular Physiotherapy at Hospital as suggested by Doctor .We have come for regular follow ups . Our child slowly has shown tremendous improvement. Every visit she speaks to the child as well to know the progress and issues. Slowly all the problems were taken care off and child is able to walk well now with no abnormal movements .Medicines have been slowly taken off and stopped now. Our child is back to what she was before .\nWe were very worried about our child but the way Dr Usha has managed her is highly commendable . Our Daughter will be looking forward to meet her . Feels very happy to see such doctors who are Highly Professional , Young  and friendly . She is an Inspiration to kids . Our daughter says she would want to be like her .\n\nThough our child is back to normal now , we visit her once in few months\nShe is very professional  pleasant and friendly Doctor \n\nOur child is doing well\nHighly Recommended\nOnce again we would like to Thank Dr usha Mallinath and Manipal Hospital \n\n",

That was a positive reinforcement for our son . we were given ample information about the condition , the possible causes and need to do relevant investigations. we followed all her advice . \n\nThere is so much thought process involved that Doctor was so mindful that all these were not discussed in the presence of child so that child is not affected Psychologically \nShe used to check the child regularly and update us about the condition . we were given all the information about the medications being used .Treatment was started and to our surprise the child showed tremendous improvement and started walking slowly and after 3 days child started walking . \nShe is a doctor with Integrity and Professionalism . She gives good insight into the problem and there is no false information . This really helps to cope up with situation .\nShe is highly inspirational for kids too .

Fits are under control now .we come for regular reviews.There is tremendous improvement in the child .With rehabilitation , child has started speaking now and leads normal life like other kids .she goes to school and is doing well.\nWe are extremely thankful to the Doctor \nWe highly recommend her any one looking for Pediatric Neurologist",

Clearly explained the problem and advised medication to be followed. \nThe way the issue was approached with clear and logical steps is really commendable. Every time the Dr sees my child, she makes him feel very comfortable speaking with him while performing the physical examination. This way both us and kids feel very reverential towards her. My kid is doing absolutely fine today. I urge all parents to not to wait for any such events and without delay a specialist has to be contacted rather than a General Paed. This enables faster analysis and early detection and cure.\nOn a lighter note , my kid enjoys the cafetaria canteen Dosa's and the Dr always mentions that he could be one of the few who would like so! This atttitude brings Usha (light rays) in many peoples lives and we sincerely thank the Dr from the bottom of our heart. May the light of Jupiter shine on her and entire family and may she bring light to many many more peoples lives.\n",
