They\u2019re 4 years old now and we swear by his recommendations & medicines. He hardly prescribes unnecessary medicines and explains queries in detail. He\u2019s very patient with the kids.  My kids absolutely enjoy visiting him. Overall he\u2019s a very warm, genuine, professional, knowledgable and kind doctor. Very difficult to find doctors like this these days. We recommend Dr. Shailesh to anyone looking for a good paediatrician. Thanks Doctor",

He diagnoses the problem properly, will listen to the parents very patiently. He also explains what is the problem, why this happens and what needs to be done to take care of the kid. Also he does not prescribe medication unnecessarily. We have gone for all the vaccinations to him. You can easily reach to him over a phone call incase of any confusion / followup if you are staying far. In-fact he suggests to call him sometimes for followups.\nI have reached out to him many times when my kid falls ill and sometimes I am satisfied only after consulting him. \nOne thing that stands out in him is that he is very passionate about his profession, very dedicated and sincere. To him it is very important to treat the kid right and he is not the one who does things for financial benefit. \nI remember he helped one of my friend\u2019s daughter over a phone call during an emergency late in the night. He was on the call till my friends reached hospital by giving directions & he had spoken to the hospital in parallel & arranged a doctor by the time my friends reached the hospital in the night. He is always ready to help.\nHe is a very nice gentleman, excellent doctor more than anything he is a good Human Being and a great character who is there to help you always.\nThank you Dr. Shaliesh for everything you do and being there always for us.",

Year ago when my son's was sick, he even called in the evening to check on him. You can't go wrong if your looking for a dedicated, honest, caring, brilliant MD! He doesnt prescribe more medicines for baby. doctor responds via messeage even after consultation which very comfortable to people who forget to ask while checkups.  So lucky to have such a wonderful pediatrician!! You're awesome Dr. SRISHYLESH !!\n\n",

He diagnoses the problem properly, will listen to the parents very patiently. He also explains what is the problem, why this happens and what needs to be done to take care of the kid. Also he does not prescribe medication unnecessarily. We have gone for all the vaccinations to him. You can easily reach to him over a phone call incase of any confusion / followup if you are staying far. In-fact he suggests to call him sometimes for followups.\nI have reached out to him many times when my kid falls ill and sometimes I am satisfied only after consulting him. \nOne thing that stands out in him is that he is very passionate about his profession, very dedicated and sincere. To him it is very important to treat the kid right and he is not the one who does things for financial benefit. \nI remember he helped one of my friend\u2019s daughter over a phone call during an emergency late in the night. He was on the call till my friends reached hospital by giving directions & he had spoken to the hospital in parallel & arranged a doctor by the time my friends reached the hospital in the night. He is always ready to help.\nHe is a very nice gentleman, excellent doctor more than anything he is a good Human Being and a great character who is there to help you always.\nThank you Dr. Shaliesh for everything you do and being there always for us.",

Year ago when my son's was sick, he even called in the evening to check on him. You can't go wrong if your looking for a dedicated, honest, caring, brilliant MD! He doesnt prescribe more medicines for baby. doctor responds via messeage even after consultation which very comfortable to people who forget to ask while checkups.  So lucky to have such a wonderful pediatrician!! You're awesome Dr. SRISHYLESH !!\n\n",

Most of the times medicines will not be required as he thinks we should avoid giving medicines to kids unnecessary if not required. We are visiting him since 2 years and never found any issue. In case of any emergency, he is available over phone and reachable which will certainly help you. \nHe hears patients problem, queries very patiently and this is the main reason you notice there is a wait time to meet him. I am still okay with this. He is not behind money like others and one of the reasons you see long queue of parents to visit him. All the best doc, you are in one of the finest profession in the world. Keep it up.",
