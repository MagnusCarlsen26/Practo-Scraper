"Doctor friendliness,","Childhood Infections,",0,0,YES,"The only problem is inspite of taking appointment , we are made to wait for more than 1.5 hrs.
The waiting time is very impractical just for consultation. 
Practo gauranties less waiting time, which is not true.
Something needs to be done with reference to waiting time, so that every patient should not wait for more than half an hour. In case the dr is busy with an emergency then all the opd patients should be communicated atleast by an sms so that they can plan accordingly.
Kindly Value everyone's time",2020-03-16 10:05:49,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
