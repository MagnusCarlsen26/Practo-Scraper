"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Newborn Jaundice,",0,0,NO,"Dr Prasanna was the assigned doctor from the hospital for our baby. Our baby had new born Jaundice.

We were not too happy that the Doctor meets the baby from a few feet away and relied on his junior, and just 2 questions, is the baby feeding, is the baby not irritable. The nurse next day mentioned, 'you need to check the baby for jaundice, baby is visibly very yellow' 
 junior doctor assisting him was more proactive And logical.

Doctor Prasanna's understanding is that the parents including the mother ( who has just delivered) need to know that if new born Jaundice isn't managed, the 1 day old baby will need to undergo full blood transfusions, and it's nity grities! We feel that if doctor would've spent so much time while around the baby when he is coming for rounds, it would add more value. If the doctor guides new parents about the baby, and how to manage jaundice and Baby with the bili blanket and Lights, it would add more value. Which he did not.

Would not recommend Dr Prasanna for new parents.",2022-09-06 04:02:16,False,False,Vijay Arora,,,

"Explanation of the health issue,",,0,0,NO,"We consulted the doctor for slight temperature for my baby. He advised us to admit the baby in hospital for observation and said we have to insert IV and give the baby antibiotics. When asked for explanation he says ok let's go for blood test and again we insisted for explanation why blood test he immediately says ok give calpol drops for baby. 
He made us worry a lot, as parents we will always want best for the child and cannot see the baby in pain. *** *********** *** *********** ********* ** ****** ********** *** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* ** ******* ******** ********* ***** ************ * **** **** ********** ",2022-01-27 08:24:55,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
