Does not ask us to visit unnecessarily for hospital, and she would respond comfortably on a call or on whats-app. \nShe was treating my daughter earlier and now our new born son.\n\nwhen it comes to New born / kids, we parents often tend to get tensed up. She would ease us and comfort by explaining the illness, causes and when we need to be cautious.  \nMy son was supposed to be admitted at hospital, he was not even a month old, however other would have insisted us to admit , but Nandini Nagar understands parents feelings, she did not take admission however responded well on phone call and whats-app. End of the day we all see for a good doctor who is ************** having patience,  good experience, interactive, genuine, reasonable and comfortable doctor.  Not all doctor has all of these, but we could think of Nandini Nagar who fits perfectly. \nWe highly recommend as parents of two, she is a very genuine doctor. ",

She is been our pediatric since his birth and we are very happy with the way she treats, cares and communicates with the baby. The best part part is that she does not unnecessarily recommend any medicine to the baby unless its critically required. She listens to the parents carefully, patiently and then makes all the suggestions and recommendations on food, medicine or any issues that you might have discussed. When our second kid was born in 2017, some other doctor was assigned and we immediately changed to Dr. Nagar only because of our experience and comfort level with her. I would strongly say that her kai guna   is very good (when she gives vaccination, my son has less pain compared to other doctor). All this is because of her vast experience and specialisation in the Neo Natal care. Due to which she is one of the most busiest doctor at Cloudnine and appointment is must to meet her. I strongly recommend Dr. Nandini Nagar to all the parents for their baby care. I conclude by saying that you feel relaxed after your meeting with her, no matter whatever the problem you have gone with. ",

Since I didn\u2019t get the appointment of the doctor the next day, I had to visit after 3 days. When I took the appointment, the doctor told that  the baby might have pulled the ear due to which the earring might have fallen off wherein the earring was pretty loose which I can confirm of.

Had travelled all the way from Sarjapur Road to Cloudnine Jayanagar to get the ear piercing done for my 6 month old daughter.\nI was asked by the practo team to be at the clinic 30 mins before the appointment as there is some gel that needs to be applied. We were a bit late and reached just 20 mins before the appointment. After 45mins, the doctor's tells us that her shift now ends and she cannot wait for the gel to take effect, which needed another 15-20 mins to completely numb the area.\n\nShe said that either we can get the piercing done now (without the ear being completely numb) or  come again some other day. Despite asking her repeatedly on what would she recommend to be the best way for my daughter, she was not straightforward enough to say that we should not do it without the ear being completely numb not was she courteous enough to give more weightage to the pain that a 6month old baby may undergo just because she cannot wait for 15 more mins.\nI decided not to go by such a doctor and got the piercing done by another doctor at the same clinic with a lot of difficulty.\nTHIS WAS MY FIRST AND LAST VISIT TO NANDINI NAGAR AND CLOUDNINE JAYANAGAR.\n\nThanks\n\nPankaj\n",

As this is our first child (which I explained to the doctor), she only answered to our questions while doing something on her computer. I wish she had devoted some time for us as it is a new experience for us as parents and we have no idea as to what is come and what needs to be done. On one side these doctors tell not to look at Google, and on the other they don't tell us anything themselves - only stick to the questions parents have is no good. Conversely, there were many good aspects of our meeting like the doctor's friendliness, conduct, punctuality, good ********* ** *** ******* **** Hope our feedback is not taken in a negative manner and is used productively.

She is been our pediatric since his birth and we are very happy with the way she treats, cares and communicates with the baby. The best part part is that she does not unnecessarily recommend any medicine to the baby unless its critically required. She listens to the parents carefully, patiently and then makes all the suggestions and recommendations on food, medicine or any issues that you might have discussed. When our second kid was born in 2017, some other doctor was assigned and we immediately changed to Dr. Nagar only because of our experience and comfort level with her. I would strongly say that her kai guna   is very good (when she gives vaccination, my son has less pain compared to other doctor). All this is because of her vast experience and specialisation in the Neo Natal care. Due to which she is one of the most busiest doctor at Cloudnine and appointment is must to meet her. I strongly recommend Dr. Nandini Nagar to all the parents for their baby care. I conclude by saying that you feel relaxed after your meeting with her, no matter whatever the problem you have gone with. ",

Then the problem started. Doctor was late by about 45min. It's ok if the patients waiting are adults and not kids. That's still ok. The doctor must have had an emergency.  But as soon the doc came the medical reps walked straight into the room n there was no staff around to stop them. This gets very annoying when you are waiting with kids. N the sister incharge was so arrogant about it. This is basically the management fault ",

Since I didn\u2019t get the appointment of the doctor the next day, I had to visit after 3 days. When I took the appointment, the doctor told that  the baby might have pulled the ear due to which the earring might have fallen off wherein the earring was pretty loose which I can confirm of. I paid around 5-6k for the entire procedure and she told me to wait for another\nmonths to get it  redone. Very rude attitude and demeanour",

In my experience, this doctor lacks the necessary skills to effectively treat children of this age group.

Had travelled all the way from Sarjapur Road to Cloudnine Jayanagar to get the ear piercing done for my 6 month old daughter.\nI was asked by the practo team to be at the clinic 30 mins before the appointment as there is some gel that needs to be applied. We were a bit late and reached just 20 mins before the appointment. After 45mins, the doctor's tells us that her shift now ends and she cannot wait for the gel to take effect, which needed another 15-20 mins to completely numb the area.\n\nShe said that either we can get the piercing done now (without the ear being completely numb) or  come again some other day. Despite asking her repeatedly on what would she recommend to be the best way for my daughter, she was not straightforward enough to say that we should not do it without the ear being completely numb not was she courteous enough to give more weightage to the pain that a 6month old baby may undergo just because she cannot wait for 15 more mins.\nI decided not to go by such a doctor and got the piercing done by another doctor at the same clinic with a lot of difficulty.\nTHIS WAS MY FIRST AND LAST VISIT TO NANDINI NAGAR AND CLOUDNINE JAYANAGAR.\n\nThanks\n\nPankaj\n",

On one side these doctors tell not to look at Google, and on the other they don't tell us anything themselves - only stick to the questions parents have is no good.
