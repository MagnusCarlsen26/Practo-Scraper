,"Children's Health,",0,0,YES,"We’ve been visiting Doctor Sailesh since the twins were born. We also get their vaccinations done with him. They’re 4 years old now and we swear by his recommendations & medicines. He hardly prescribes unnecessary medicines and explains queries in detail. He’s very patient with the kids.  My kids absolutely enjoy visiting him. Overall he’s a very warm, genuine, professional, knowledgable and kind doctor. Very difficult to find doctors like this these days. We recommend Dr. Shailesh to anyone looking for a good paediatrician. Thanks Doctor",2024-01-24 08:34:38,False,True,Rasana K,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Consultation provided for newborns ,Paediatric Emergency  Care,Pediatrics Critical Care,Childhood Infections,Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,YES,"I owe this review to Neonatologist  Dr. Shrishailesh Mantur

We were blessed with twin babies on 2nd October 2020  at Apollo cradle Koramangala,  it was premature delivery of 32 weeks with babies' weights of 1.01 and 1.05.

we were sure from the words of Dr. Mekhala our gyno that nothing to worry about because Dr. Shrishailesh Mantur is there to take care of the babies.

NICU team were prepared well in advance, after birth they monitored and took extreme care of babies with proper counseling given to us each day.

Its always a tense situation for parents to see babies in NICU, but the timely treatment where instances of low HB blood transfusion were very well managed, necessary tests and scans were done to avoid further complications, proper information was given to us and I need to say this Apollo cradle is blessed to have such doctors. 

Dr. Shrishailesh gives us the comfort to ask endless queries, his confidence in treatment sets him as the best Neonatologist.

My babies stayed in NICU for 45 days and were discharged with the weight of 1.7 and 1.65, they were blessed to be taken care of so well by the best Neonatologist and NICU nurses who are always there 24hrs.

also while discharge they guided us with follow-up plans, vaccinations & feeding plans.

Thanks a ton, doctor !!

There is a popular belief that most of the doctors suffer from  God complex. Dr Shailesh is just exact opposite of that. 

He is exceptionally knowledgeable and experienced.  But the qualities that make him stand out are  his patience,  calm composure, fine  temperament and good listening skills.
