He had also become extremely weak. My paediatrician friend suggested to stop anti-viral and consult Doctor for examinatiob of chest. I visited Springleaf and Dr. Anuradha had been quite kind and comforting and reassured everything would be alright and prescribed the right medicines. In contrast another popular paediatrician at a nearby hospital was extremely rude when I requested nurse/sister to seek his advice on lab tests to be performed for my ailing children, something rhat needed just 2 minutes of his time.",

My son had viral fever for more than 7 days that resulted in secondary bacterial infection and earlier doctor I visited has administered anti-viral although all tests were negative and could not reach her at all over the weekend for any advice when my son was suffering from side affects and was continously vomitting. He had also become extremely weak. My paediatrician friend suggested to stop anti-viral and consult Doctor for examinatiob of chest. I visited Springleaf and Dr. Anuradha had been quite kind and comforting and reassured everything would be alright and prescribed the right medicines. In contrast another popular paediatrician at a nearby hospital was extremely rude when I requested nurse/sister to seek his advice on lab tests to be performed for my ailing children, something rhat needed just 2 minutes of his time.",
