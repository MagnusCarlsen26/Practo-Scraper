The clinic is very well maintained, hygienic and disinfected well during covid time. First impression- Dr. Arjun has always kept up time, a sigh of relief for me as a customer whenever appointments and time are respected in our country, he is very friendly and patient, takes time to justify and explain his advices, responds quickly on WhatsApp, approachable and level headed. A good doctor understand the emotions of a new mom and the baby and Dr. Arjun gets a thumbs up from me on this regard.\nI never judge a book by its cover and never judge too quickly, I took my time to analyse their service, waited for few experiences before giving my genuine review after three appointments and I WALKED OUT AS A VERY HAPPY MOM today after my little 6 months baby Manya got vaccinated by Dr. Arjun. She didn\u2019t cry at all, I asked the doctor twice if he finished cause I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nI have been working for a long time now, a good review doesn\u2019t come easily from a customer unless a good job has been done and I can tell when a person is passionate about his/her job, Dr. Arjun is certainly one of them!\n\nHope future vaccinations continue to be as smooth and good as it was today, a good doctor for my baby is a mom\u2019s best gift. Keeping my hopes high on Dr. Arjun and I am sure he won\u2019t let me down. I feel my little baby is in safe hands.",

We have been visiting Dr Arjun, since 2 years now and every time we have visited him, he has treated my daughter very diligently and provided the best care and suggestions. Thanks to Dr Arjun and we highly recommend him for all your peadiatric requirements and suggestions. He is one of the most efficient pediatrician and he doesn't load you with too many medicines and provide you the right suggestions timely.

The clinic is very well maintained, hygienic and disinfected well during covid time. First impression- Dr. Arjun has always kept up time, a sigh of relief for me as a customer whenever appointments and time are respected in our country, he is very friendly and patient, takes time to justify and explain his advices, responds quickly on WhatsApp, approachable and level headed. A good doctor understand the emotions of a new mom and the baby and Dr. Arjun gets a thumbs up from me on this regard.\nI never judge a book by its cover and never judge too quickly, I took my time to analyse their service, waited for few experiences before giving my genuine review after three appointments and I WALKED OUT AS A VERY HAPPY MOM today after my little 6 months baby Manya got vaccinated by Dr. Arjun. She didn\u2019t cry at all, I asked the doctor twice if he finished cause I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nI have been working for a long time now, a good review doesn\u2019t come easily from a customer unless a good job has been done and I can tell when a person is passionate about his/her job, Dr. Arjun is certainly one of them!\n\nHope future vaccinations continue to be as smooth and good as it was today, a good doctor for my baby is a mom\u2019s best gift. Keeping my hopes high on Dr. Arjun and I am sure he won\u2019t let me down. I feel my little baby is in safe hands.",

We have been visiting Dr Arjun, since 2 years now and every time we have visited him, he has treated my daughter very diligently and provided the best care and suggestions. Thanks to Dr Arjun and we highly recommend him for all your peadiatric requirements and suggestions. He is one of the most efficient pediatrician and he doesn't load you with too many medicines and provide you the right suggestions timely.

It was matter of max 2 weeks time and I did not have to give supplement to baby at all. And my baby's weight also got very gud plus his discomfort reduced n we saw happy baby after stopping supplements. I am very thankful to doctor and I highly recommend him \ud83d\ude4f",

Dr. Arjun is extremely diligent and thorough when it comes to Pediatrics. He is very patient and at the same time very friendly who genuinely cares about his patients. He clearly explains things to us in terms that we can understand. We have always felt very confident in his care. He is also available for phone calls & WhatsApp in case of emergency which is very much necessary when we have become parents for the 1st time. The staff always follow up with us and call to remind us about our appointments. I do recommend Dr. Arjun if anyone is looking for a good Pediatrician.\n\nRegards,\nAnil\n",

He made sure a senior surgeon checked, confirmed it was not by birth and now with the diet plan he suggested it\u2019s all cured. Also he is so very flexible, understanding and co-operative by nature because my daughter kind of panics & pukes during vaccination. So he makes time for her and comes early to give her vaccination. He also does video and phone consultation. Too very, overall satisfied with the treatment and Doctor.

The vaccinations which doctor gives without even getting him know is amazing, it was a very big task for me to get my son for vaccinations or just check ups to the hospital, am glad to get to know about Doctor Arjun and very much thankful to him.",
