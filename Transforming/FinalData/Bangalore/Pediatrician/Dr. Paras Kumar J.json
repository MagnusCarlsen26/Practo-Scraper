Now  I feel that I took a hasty decision in providing a low rating because thinking from the doctors perspective he was right as the medical file is really important. \n5 stars to the doctor. ",

He will make you so comfortable and become close to you as a friend or family, you feel that so quickly after couple of visits. We go to visit him by traveling an hour even we have multiple hospitals around in our area R.T Nagar, because we feel so authentic, trusted and treatment is value for fee.\n\nThanks a lot sir being associated with us!!
