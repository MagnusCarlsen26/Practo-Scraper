Felt very robotic and no empathy. \n\nBoth time he just pointed to his hospital and shared number of his hospital.

After that he got some calls on his mobile which he took almost 10 mins to finish. After all this he just checked the baby and said all is fine.\nHis behaviour was very unprofessional and i would recommend the doctor to first listen to the patient, and check the baby. He can give his clinic information in the end once the consultation is finished. Also taking calls in the middle of the consultation and that too for more than 10 mins is not at all good and shows a high level of unprofessionalism. Urgent calls can be taken but the calls that were taken during the consultation could have been easily taken afterwards.",

After we explained the issue, the doctor just used stethoscope to check for cold while the baby was still in my lap. He then straight away started typing out the medicine on his system and handed us a print out. Was very surprised to see that doctor did not even ask if we are administering any other medicine to the baby or how many days the condition is existing. For a consultation fees of 800 Rs. and more than 1 hour wait time, we expected better treatment instead of mere 5 minutes. Also, one of the medicines he prescribed is not available inside the motherhood pharmacy and is it not available anywhere else even in online meds.  *** **** ******** ***** ** ** **** **** *** **** ***** * **** ***** ** **** ** **** * ****** **** He was unavailable to contact to get an alternate medicine.

Felt very robotic and no empathy. \n\nBoth time he just pointed to his hospital and shared number of his hospital.

After that he got some calls on his mobile which he took almost 10 mins to finish. After all this he just checked the baby and said all is fine.\nHis behaviour was very unprofessional and i would recommend the doctor to first listen to the patient, and check the baby. He can give his clinic information in the end once the consultation is finished. Also taking calls in the middle of the consultation and that too for more than 10 mins is not at all good and shows a high level of unprofessionalism. Urgent calls can be taken but the calls that were taken during the consultation could have been easily taken afterwards.",

After we explained the issue, the doctor just used stethoscope to check for cold while the baby was still in my lap. He then straight away started typing out the medicine on his system and handed us a print out. Was very surprised to see that doctor did not even ask if we are administering any other medicine to the baby or how many days the condition is existing. For a consultation fees of 800 Rs. and more than 1 hour wait time, we expected better treatment instead of mere 5 minutes. Also, one of the medicines he prescribed is not available inside the motherhood pharmacy and is it not available anywhere else even in online meds.  *** **** ******** ***** ** ** **** **** *** **** ***** * **** ***** ** **** ** **** * ****** **** He was unavailable to contact to get an alternate medicine. Very disappointed. Doctor must prescribe medicines which are easily available else it's difficult for babies. ",
