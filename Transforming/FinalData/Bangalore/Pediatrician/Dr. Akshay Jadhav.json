We were worried for Covid outbreak and how it may affect him and as we weren't in Bengaluru, we needed reliable Doctor whom we could trust. We had earlier met Dr Akshay at Cloudnine in emergency. He was probably the most cordial, had immense patience and understanding to explain points in a very understandable manner, for my elder daughter . And we knew he was very good and we were thoroughly impressed and his suggestions brought relief to my elder daughter who has chronic allergic issues, we were sure that he will understand my younger sons issues as well. And then we searched on net and when we found him in Practo we contacted him for high grade fever for my son. As we were panicked he first consoled and told about the right steps to follow. He literally tells pinpoint steps with exact expectations later too. I have hardly seen any Doctor do it in my lifetime. And within 3 days my son got healed from the illness and we were thinking that for Doctors like him who are so good it must be so difficult and must have done so much of hard work to come to this stage where he can authoritatively say that he won't need admission and to be patient, and tests asked and the explanation done on Day one about all possibilities were so accurate that we were overwhelmed with his attitude and willingness to help parents who were distant and in a small town with perfect plan. I would recommend him any day to anyone who wants Teleconsult or Physical. He is as good in Teleconsults as he is on Physical consult as well. I truly appreciate his patience and support for our children. God bless You Sir.",

We were worried for Covid outbreak and how it may affect him and as we weren't in Bengaluru, we needed reliable Doctor whom we could trust. We had earlier met Dr Akshay at Cloudnine in emergency. He was probably the most cordial, had immense patience and understanding to explain points in a very understandable manner, for my elder daughter . And we knew he was very good and we were thoroughly impressed and his suggestions brought relief to my elder daughter who has chronic allergic issues, we were sure that he will understand my younger sons issues as well. And then we searched on net and when we found him in Practo we contacted him for high grade fever for my son. As we were panicked he first consoled and told about the right steps to follow. He literally tells pinpoint steps with exact expectations later too. I have hardly seen any Doctor do it in my lifetime. And within 3 days my son got healed from the illness and we were thinking that for Doctors like him who are so good it must be so difficult and must have done so much of hard work to come to this stage where he can authoritatively say that he won't need admission and to be patient, and tests asked and the explanation done on Day one about all possibilities were so accurate that we were overwhelmed with his attitude and willingness to help parents who were distant and in a small town with perfect plan. I would recommend him any day to anyone who wants Teleconsult or Physical. He is as good in Teleconsults as he is on Physical consult as well. I truly appreciate his patience and support for our children. God bless You Sir.",
