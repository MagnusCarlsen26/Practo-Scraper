She is a preterm baby *** ** ****** ** **** *** **** ** *** ****** ** *** ************* **** **** ** *** *********** ********** He explains us every thing in detail, purpose of the medicine, impact of it.  He explains ever single question even tho if it's a very simple one, he still explains us with full patience. He is been helping us in up bringing a healthy child. He never suggested us any unwanted treatments . He only recommended us the nutritional food that's prepared at home and affordable food never suggested us ready to eat foods available in markets.  Being a new mom, I was asked to follow so many myths by family members but Dr Naveen explained us what is right and what is a myth. He also suggested what a new mom is supposed to eat and how much we need to eat for baby to get all the Nutrition during breastfeeding. He never rushes the parents in his consultation. He gives us all the time to question him and take clarification. He listens to us with all patience. And the best part is he takes the responsibility of vaccinating the babies. He never asks his support staff / Nurses to do that like how other Doctors do. He was responsive over a phone calls , what's app  and helped us during this pandemic alot when ever my daughter was ill due to High Grand fever, vomiting, loose stools. He gave more importance to the safety of the child. ",

Dr. Naveen was very kind and patient with the younger child. His treatment was thorough, yet conservative. He does not dispense antibiotic without real need. Moreover, he takes time to educate the child's parent on his/her condition, as well as treatment provided. He even follows up with the patients family to ensure he is aware of the progress/outcome of the treatment. This aspect is very humane and indeed, very comforting for the ailing child's family. \n\nReally recommend Dr. Naveen as paediatrician to all who is reading this!\n\nThanks\nDorothy ",

I checked in online and found Dr Naveen R B in cloudnine hospital. Whatever the review I saw in online, he is exactly the same. Very gentle, well behaive and good manners and the most important thing he listen to patients very carefully and then treat them as required. He gave the test exactly what is required for my baby and no other test for business. He is very polite in nature. I have never seen such doctor in my life. In the very first dose of medicine his fever got down and in fifth day while doing the test again we found his CRP level came to normal range (3.7). I wish him all success in his life. Thank you.",

The Doctor was very kind enough to attend to the child despite the timing being odd and was very considerate. Since then , we consult him for all the medical issues concerning my child including regular consultation and vaccination. He is very patient , listens to the issues actively, explains in detail on the child's medication, clarifies our queries clearly, and on top of all ensures his availability to his patients whenever in need, which is highly rare to be seen these days among physicians. Highly recommend Dr Naveen and the Little Krishna clinic. Excellent !",

Being a new mom, I was asked to follow so many myths by family members but Dr Naveen explained us what is right and what is a myth. He also suggested what a new mom is supposed to eat and how much we need to eat for baby to get all the Nutrition during breastfeeding. He never rushes the parents in his consultation. He gives us all the time to question him and take clarification. He listens to us with all patience. And the best part is he takes the responsibility of vaccinating the babies. He never asks his support staff / Nurses to do that like how other Doctors do. He was responsive over a phone calls , what's app  and helped us during this pandemic alot when ever my daughter was ill due to High Grand fever, vomiting, loose stools.

Dr. Naveen was very kind and patient with the younger child. His treatment was thorough, yet conservative. He does not dispense antibiotic without real need. Moreover, he takes time to educate the child's parent on his/her condition, as well as treatment provided. He even follows up with the patients family to ensure he is aware of the progress/outcome of the treatment. This aspect is very humane and indeed, very comforting for the ailing child's family. \n\nReally recommend Dr. Naveen as paediatrician to all who is reading this!\n\nThanks\nDorothy ",

But after the dose of anti biotic completed again he got high fever. In the last four days he had 103F fever and then immediately I took him to bangalore for treatment. I checked in online and found Dr Naveen R B in cloudnine hospital. Whatever the review I saw in online, he is exactly the same. Very gentle, well behaive and good manners and the most important thing he listen to patients very carefully and then treat them as required. He gave the test exactly what is required for my baby and no other test for business. He is very polite in nature. I have never seen such doctor in my life. In the very first dose of medicine his fever got down and in fifth day while doing the test again we found his CRP level came to normal range (3.7). I wish him all success in his life. Thank you.",

The Doctor was very kind enough to attend to the child despite the timing being odd and was very considerate. Since then , we consult him for all the medical issues concerning my child including regular consultation and vaccination. He is very patient , listens to the issues actively, explains in detail on the child's medication, clarifies our queries clearly, and on top of all ensures his availability to his patients whenever in need, which is highly rare to be seen these days among physicians. Highly recommend Dr Naveen and the Little Krishna clinic. Excellent !",

Naveen sir gave me the right solution to it when I called him without even asking for appointment and things like that.. His suggestion saved my son again when the same situation recurred.

                "reply_text": "Dear Sheetal Dixit,\nThank you for ur concern.\nFirst The Whole World is in Corona pandemic, According to the hospital rules only One Attender is allowed inside the hospital. Attenders should wear proper mask and maintain social distancing. For both Safety of the Patients and the Hospital staff also.\nMy OPD timings was over & I had removed my PPE kit, the management told a walk in patient want to consult for the Vaccination.\nBut I still took the risk and did the consultation by wearing Facemask and Faceshield and Double glows.\nSince the Lockdown has started we are allowing Only One Attender to enter inside the OPD for Safety measures.\nBut u started having Argument that I also want to enter the OPD along with the mother and baby to overcrowd the OPD [ 10 by 10 feet OPD room ]. As in the previous consultation other doctor had allowed to do so.\nIf other doctor don't follow safety measures it's risking the Doctor, Urself, Baby & Nursing Staff attending to the patient .\nYou were not wearing a proper mask as well which Covers both ur Nose and Mouth ( Spong mask which u were wearing is of 0% protection for Corona virus ), Ur Nose was Protruding Outside Inhaling & Exhaling the air outside Risking Urself and Hospital staff also.( As Corona is Airborne especially in closed Air-conditioned environment ) WHO World Health Organization has declared it. \nVirus can transmit upto 8 feet & keep suspended in air for many hours.\nComing to the consultation inside the OPD room. Red tape line is put on the Floor & Sticker ( One Person Only allowed Inside ) Legibly and Pictorial Foot Image also ( Any Layman can also Understand it ). \nAnd my OPD doors are always kept open for Proper Air Circulation. ( Since lockdown we are following the protocols in my OPD room ).\nInspite of it u were crossing the safety line and trying to touch the table risking Urself & Hospital staff for the Corona infection by Not Maintaining Social distancing.\nYour baby was Preterm Born with weight of 2.03 kg but ur baby was not put on Proper Supplements, I advised u to start the Supplements and explained the mother regarding the proper growth and development. I don't know what was the reason the Supplements was not started for ur baby in the previous consultations. ( Please read the prescription )\nMother asked can she feed in Nipple bottle, I advised Nipple bottles should never be used to any baby at any point of life, use only spoon or pallada only. ( Standard Pediatric protocol ) \nThese all discussions I had with the mother after the Vaccination.\nYou were upset ( father ) for not allowing you inside the OPD. ( Reason is to Avoid over crowding inside the 10 by 10 OPD room ) \nNext time when u visit any doctor please Wear Proper Mask and Maintain Social Distancing. It's my Sincere Advice as a doctor. Corona will not spare any one. Till now many doctors have succumbed for Corona for not taking Safety Measures. \nTill we get Vaccination & Proper Treatment Protocol. We should follow all safety measures. \nAs a Responsible Citizen please follow Safety measures from now on atleast and educate others also.\nPlease start the Supplements as prescribed as your preterm babies require it for proper Growth and Development of Brain & Body it's already delayed. 80% myelination of brain happens in first 12 months( 1st year ), 15% myelination happens in 2nd year of life, rest 5% happens later. ( Supplements are prescribed according to standard Pediatric protocols )\nAll discussions in hospital was not arrogance it's for patients safety ( ie Your safety ).\nI have followed all safety measures since lockdown has started & will continue to do till we come out from the CORONA Pandemic.\nHope you will also follow it in future hospital visits.\nHope I have answered ur concerns Sheetal Dixit.\nAt last Please consider Doctors as Human beings they also have there old aged parents & near dear once waiting at home, they risk their life and treat the society even in Pandemic.\nI haven't taken a single day leave since the pandemic has started, done my duty sincerely.\nHope this reply will be helpful & educating many in the society.\nStay safe & Stay healthy for Healthy Society.\n\nThank you.\nDr Naveen RB\n\n\n",

We have consulted couple of doctors but could not see any improvement in our baby's health. \n\nThen we came to know of Dr Naveen thru Practo app and consulted him immediately over phone. To our surprise he responded promptly and asked us to visit his clinic near Indiranagar. We visited the clinic and and he had provided us very good suggestion and explained clearly the reason behind the cough and cold in our baby. Diagnosis was excellent and the treatment also helped our baby recover soon. Also he would schedule the periodic check ups to ensure the baby is healthy and active.\n\nWe found him truly responsible and caring given the busy schedule of lot of doctors today. Definitely recommend Dr. Naveen for treatment of your kids / children ailments. ",

More importantly , he suggested which of them are the most important and much be given and the once that can be mostly avoided unless absolutely necessary. He also explain the functionality of each medicine. Will definitely suggest him. he also call and confirm about the child how is doing. \nAt last, not least lots of thanks from my heart to D. Naveen.

He told us to create a good atmosphere for the child,then only there will be a progress in giving medicines. We did and he started medicines which is to be followed for 2_3 months. He make calls and enquires our child's progress which no others will do. Now we have decided him for the further visits. We have only one option and that is none other than Dr Naveen.

More than half of the time was spent explaining benefits of breastfeeding instead of listening to us explaining the health issue or symptoms. Everything we said was tied back to lack of breastfeeding. I am sure no mother on this planet gives formula as a first choice. Without knowing our history and reason of formula feeding he continued on the evils of formula.\n\nHe did prescribe the medicines with which i could see some improvement in my kid. I am happy with the results. However he was quite judgmental *** *********** and should refrain from hurting the sentiments of mothers who could not breastfeed their child.",
