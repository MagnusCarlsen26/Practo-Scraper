Dr Vimal gave me the confidence that I needed that the baby will be completely fine and will be well taken care of. Be it in the NICU or during our regular health check ups, he understands that every parent will be practically worried about everything and answers every question patiently. With the baby, he is quite gentle and even apologises to the baby when she cries. I would recommend Dr Vimal sir 10/10 as a paediatrician.",
