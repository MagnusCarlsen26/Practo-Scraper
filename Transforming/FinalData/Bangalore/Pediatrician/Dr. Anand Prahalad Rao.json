His healing examination of the child and responsiveness gives you ample confidence of cure. I have been visiting him since the 3rd day of my son's birth and I have never even thought of looking out for another doctor. Though, my family consulted other doctors, their opinions were no different than Dr.Anand's. Now, even for my family, the doctor's words are final in terms of his health. Vaccines are administered neatly with no side effects. Antibiotics are never suggested until it is absolutely necessary.  A doctor who responds to you even in the wee hours of the day in case of emergencies.I have troubled him umpteen times due to my anxiety with repeated questions and he has kept calm all throughout. Even when out of town, he has suggested medicines due to which I had a breather until return and consult him. Because of the clarity of explanations,today, I am able to handle my kid without fear in case of any illness. I no more panic in situations relating to my child. Though, some parents may feel consultation slightly pricey, trust me, it is worth the spend. All my colleagues and friends to whom I have referred this doctor do visit him and none else now and their experience is also no different than mine. The confidence my son has on him is tremendous, that he says \"mamma, please call doctor uncle and say ritvik is not well and I will be fine tomorrow\". I guess that summarizes how good a doctor he is. In the present business minded medical world, Rest assured, the child's health and well being is the first and ultimate priority at this clinic. \n\nHappy Visit",

He radiates a positive aura which gives lot of comfort for a first-time-panicky-moms like me. He listens patiently and reassures. He is always smiling and approachable. Does not give medication unnecessarily. Although he is the most-sort-after doctor in the locality, unlike other doctors, getting his appointment is not a herculean task.

Going to him, I am sure that my children are never over-medicated, and, will be treated right. \nI personally do not believe in giving medicines to children, and am glad to have found a doctor who is willing to take time and not medicate unnecessarily. Some of his remedies are very simple, and effective.\nThank you Sir!\n\nNavitha",

We started my first visit to Dr Anand when our elder one  was 3 months old back in 2005 and from then I had visited Doctor many times for different problems .Always came back rest assured . We  had gone to Manipal also few times to meet Doctor due to distance as we stayed in whitefield . I have always suggested my relatives and friends to meet Dr Anand whenever i heard of any health issue. For my sister's daughter he was the one to figure out some head related issue and saved her providing right direction . She is fine now jumping and dancing.  It is a great experience for me for both kids , to me once we meet Dr Anand , most of the problem is solved. My younger child says \"It has been so long that we met Dr Anand uncle, when are we meeting him again \" and we will meet him soon for his adenoid issue that he is going through now . Every minute of waiting at either manipal or Vijaya Children hospital to meet him is worth . \nThanks a lot Doctor.",

His healing examination of the child and responsiveness gives you ample confidence of cure. I have been visiting him since the 3rd day of my son's birth and I have never even thought of looking out for another doctor. Though, my family consulted other doctors, their opinions were no different than Dr.Anand's. Now, even for my family, the doctor's words are final in terms of his health. Vaccines are administered neatly with no side effects. Antibiotics are never suggested until it is absolutely necessary.  A doctor who responds to you even in the wee hours of the day in case of emergencies.I have troubled him umpteen times due to my anxiety with repeated questions and he has kept calm all throughout. Even when out of town, he has suggested medicines due to which I had a breather until return and consult him. Because of the clarity of explanations,today, I am able to handle my kid without fear in case of any illness. I no more panic in situations relating to my child. Though, some parents may feel consultation slightly pricey, trust me, it is worth the spend. All my colleagues and friends to whom I have referred this doctor do visit him and none else now and their experience is also no different than mine. The confidence my son has on him is tremendous, that he says \"mamma, please call doctor uncle and say ritvik is not well and I will be fine tomorrow\". I guess that summarizes how good a doctor he is. In the present business minded medical world, Rest assured, the child's health and well being is the first and ultimate priority at this clinic. \n\nHappy Visit",

He radiates a positive aura which gives lot of comfort for a first-time-panicky-moms like me. He listens patiently and reassures. He is always smiling and approachable. Does not give medication unnecessarily. Although he is the most-sort-after doctor in the locality, unlike other doctors, getting his appointment is not a herculean task.

Going to him, I am sure that my children are never over-medicated, and, will be treated right. \nI personally do not believe in giving medicines to children, and am glad to have found a doctor who is willing to take time and not medicate unnecessarily. Some of his remedies are very simple, and effective.\nThank you Sir!\n\nNavitha",

We started my first visit to Dr Anand when our elder one  was 3 months old back in 2005 and from then I had visited Doctor many times for different problems .Always came back rest assured . We  had gone to Manipal also few times to meet Doctor due to distance as we stayed in whitefield . I have always suggested my relatives and friends to meet Dr Anand whenever i heard of any health issue. For my sister's daughter he was the one to figure out some head related issue and saved her providing right direction . She is fine now jumping and dancing.  It is a great experience for me for both kids , to me once we meet Dr Anand , most of the problem is solved. My younger child says \"It has been so long that we met Dr Anand uncle, when are we meeting him again \" and we will meet him soon for his adenoid issue that he is going through now . Every minute of waiting at either manipal or Vijaya Children hospital to meet him is worth . \nThanks a lot Doctor.",

He is soo cool. You can actually ask any number of questions to him. He is all ears. He always has that smile on his face. We really liked the experience.",

Some children do tend to become anxious like your child did become and it was aggravated by your inability to restrain the child properly even after I had given instructions. Once the child becomes agitated it only settles down after it leaves the chamber. Kindly understand that we have a narrow window to examine an irritable & agitated child and we tend to utilise the window with a quick but thorough examination. if it appeared hasty to you, I must confess I can't do anything much about it. I have always felt proud of the fact that I have given my time and my skills to all my patients. Anyways I wish you best of luck in your search for a better paediatrician.",
