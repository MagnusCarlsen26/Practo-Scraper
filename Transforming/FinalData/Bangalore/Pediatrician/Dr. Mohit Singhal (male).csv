On first visit he told us it’s normal just apply good shop and good lotion it will go but it increased so I asked in whatsapp he has given one cream “ siloderm mixi” which worked any all allergies cured from the body but in the face it was still there so I asked doc on the whatsapp he told to put some other lotion this time on face. I have shown the image of the product then he has given me the link to pay for video consultation. Like really?? We visited 5 days back for the same issue in the clinic and the issue is still persists. As per the clinic they told us 6 days we can come for follow up without paying. The doc is saying why you are asking so much questions on phone? Its a duty of a doc to make the patient understand about the medicine and the process of applying it. 

Rather than sending the payment link if he would have asked me to come to clinic and visit that would be also a acceptable comment from a renowned doctor.
