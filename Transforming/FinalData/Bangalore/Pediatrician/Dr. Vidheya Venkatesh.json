Our baby since being a preterm had weight and infant jondice issues. The doctor took the baby through her initial days after birth and made sure that the our baby was given the ***** treatment and care. \nHe is not only very approachable and professional in his consultation but he is also quite friendly in advising the right way of bringing up the kid. \nIt was our first child and we had very little idea how to go about, Dr Vidheya helped us understand our baby girl better. Our baby is gaining weight now and her jondice is reducing. Thank you doctor!! \nI would highly recommend the doc to my friends and their babies. ",

I am not sure if this should be attributed to the doctor or the hospital. If there is a way I can give thumbs up to my consultation experience separately, I would have done so.I went for 7th month vaccination which was just influenza shot. Even before consultation, nurse came with the prescription to buy vaccine which was surprising as up until then, vaccine is prescribed only after clearing the baby. When the vaccine amount was high, we were surprised as it was only supposed to be influenza. But with vaccine bought, we went to see the doc where we asked if it\u2019s just influenza and he said no we are doing typhoid as well. He said your book is outdated (trust me it\u2019s been only 7 months since the baby was born), now typhoid should be given btw 6-12 months and we at cloud nine give it at 7th month..we weren\u2019t too sure abt it but we are not experts and doctor is saying this and he has not given us an option to think about it coz we were told to buy the vaccination before consultation. So this is my problem here. We are coming here for our baby\u2019s immunisation and we want the best for her but there is a level of trust that needs to be established and that was not there. If doctor is going outside the book, shouldn\u2019t the parents be aware of it before purchasing the vaccination. Then the parents can actually digest that information and probably ask for time to wait on this particular vaccine, just saying. I went ahead and checked couple of my relatives *** ******** *********** **** *** ********* *** ***** *** ******* ******* ** **** ****** * **** ***** *** ******** *** ******** ******* ************ ***** *** ******* ******* ** ** **** ****** ** *** ******** ********** **** *** ** ***** ***** ******* ** **** * **** ******* **** ** ******** ******* ******* ******** *** **** ********* ** ***** ******** **** * *** ****, atleast we need to be informed of the decision. Now my baby never had fever after vaccinations before *** **** **** *** *** **** **** ****** ******** *** ******* ********* *** ***** ******* ****** **** ***** **** * ******* ** ***** *** ***** But I am sensible enough not to write a bad review bcos of common side effects of vaccine but I truly believe if he had consulted first and told she needs typhoid vaccine now as opposed to the immunisation chart of India and convinced us, it would have been a different story. No this they told while they were opening the vacc medicines. I kind of feel buying the medicine before consultation was a way for them to expedite the consultation but with kind of premium consultation charges they levy on us, though ours might be a straight forward vaccination consultation, we really wish it was handled better.",

Our baby since being a preterm had weight and infant jondice issues. The doctor took the baby through her initial days after birth and made sure that the our baby was given the ***** treatment and care. \nHe is not only very approachable and professional in his consultation but he is also quite friendly in advising the right way of bringing up the kid. \nIt was our first child and we had very little idea how to go about, Dr Vidheya helped us understand our baby girl better. Our baby is gaining weight now and her jondice is reducing. Thank you doctor!! \nI would highly recommend the doc to my friends and their babies. ",

I am not sure if this should be attributed to the doctor or the hospital. If there is a way I can give thumbs up to my consultation experience separately, I would have done so.I went for 7th month vaccination which was just influenza shot. Even before consultation, nurse came with the prescription to buy vaccine which was surprising as up until then, vaccine is prescribed only after clearing the baby. When the vaccine amount was high, we were surprised as it was only supposed to be influenza. But with vaccine bought, we went to see the doc where we asked if it\u2019s just influenza and he said no we are doing typhoid as well. He said your book is outdated (trust me it\u2019s been only 7 months since the baby was born), now typhoid should be given btw 6-12 months and we at cloud nine give it at 7th month..we weren\u2019t too sure abt it but we are not experts and doctor is saying this and he has not given us an option to think about it coz we were told to buy the vaccination before consultation. So this is my problem here. We are coming here for our baby\u2019s immunisation and we want the best for her but there is a level of trust that needs to be established and that was not there. If doctor is going outside the book, shouldn\u2019t the parents be aware of it before purchasing the vaccination. Then the parents can actually digest that information and probably ask for time to wait on this particular vaccine, just saying. I went ahead and checked couple of my relatives *** ******** *********** **** *** ********* *** ***** *** ******* ******* ** **** ****** * **** ***** *** ******** *** ******** ******* ************ ***** *** ******* ******* ** ** **** ****** ** *** ******** ********** **** *** ** ***** ***** ******* ** **** * **** ******* **** ** ******** ******* ******* ******** *** **** ********* ** ***** ******** **** * *** ****, atleast we need to be informed of the decision. Now my baby never had fever after vaccinations before *** **** **** *** *** **** **** ****** ******** *** ******* ********* *** ***** ******* ****** **** ***** **** * ******* ** ***** *** ***** But I am sensible enough not to write a bad review bcos of common side effects of vaccine but I truly believe if he had consulted first and told she needs typhoid vaccine now as opposed to the immunisation chart of India and convinced us, it would have been a different story. No this they told while they were opening the vacc medicines. I kind of feel buying the medicine before consultation was a way for them to expedite the consultation but with kind of premium consultation charges they levy on us, though ours might be a straight forward vaccination consultation, we really wish it was handled better.",
