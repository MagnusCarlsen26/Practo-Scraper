"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","All Pediatric Problems ,Children's Health,Childhood Infections,Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,YES,"Dr Anand Rao has been our children's paediatrician for the last 15 years! Over the years he has become a very good family friend, as well, besides being the role model for our daughter who is now doing her 2nd year MBBS. 

Few things that stand out are his very calm demeanour, high level of patience, top notch diagnosis and absolute minimal prescription of drugs! In the last 15 years his diagnosis has always been very accurate. As a parent, consulting him has always been comforting and reassuring as we know he will solve any illness or issue that we take up to him!
