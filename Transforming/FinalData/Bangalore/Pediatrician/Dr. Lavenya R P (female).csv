,,0,0,NO,"I know Dr is good but the system in Rainbow is not understandable. I visited there for my kid just 4 days back now when she is getting some problem and we need some emergency help from dr. This hospital has no option, nothing to just provide us a call help. Today when de is not available in hospital, we are just helpless for our kid. There should be some way to connect to dr in between the treatment going on, that is very much imp. For us it is really annoying to change de every now and than just because they do not talk over ph or respond over watsap.",2024-02-29 07:24:30,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
