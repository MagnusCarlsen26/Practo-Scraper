Not sure why the lab is not following even this critical situation with time bound. Also just 2 hours back only taken test of UTE, but once again Dr adviced to take test in SARV clinic only. The cost of UTE also double in SARV.\nMy recommendation is to align  the report cost with market reasonable rate and should not insist to take again if the port was already done. **** ***** *********** ******** ***** ****** *** ******* *** *** *********** **** ******* *********** *** ***** ***** ******* *** ** ***** ****** ** **** *** ** *** ** ****** ******.

I need to appreciate they given the first priority to consult the doctor and given pain killer syrub to reduce the pain.  Post that my kid was feeling better. He is polite and kind. \nwhat i don't like is the culture report has to come 3 days. but lab system was showing as 6 days. Not sure why the lab is not following even this critical situation with time bound. Also just 2 hours back only taken test of UTE, but once again Dr adviced to take test in SARV clinic only. The cost of UTE also double in SARV.\nMy recommendation is to align  the report cost with market reasonable rate and should not insist to take again if the port was already done. **** ***** *********** ******** ***** ****** *** ******* *** *** *********** **** ******* *********** *** ***** ***** ******* *** ** ***** ****** ** **** *** ** *** ** ****** ******.  All report and scans are normal finally. Finally the culture report came in 3 days after Dr spoken to lab people.\nwe continued the prescription as he suggested. *** **** ** **** ******* **** ************* *** ***** ****** ********** ********** *** ** *** *** ** ****** ************** ** **** ** *** ********** ***** **** ************ ****** ** ****** *** *********** ***********\nEnsure the report on time and avoid paying the fees once again due to report delay if beyond the free consultation after 3 days.\nKindly take it as positive feed back if really worth and customer satisfaction.\n\n\n",
