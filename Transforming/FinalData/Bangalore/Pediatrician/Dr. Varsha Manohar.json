Your compassion, dedication, and unwavering commitment to your patients truly shine through in every interaction.\n\nWhen my daughter was wrongly diagnosed with cerebral ataxia by another doctor, we were filled with worry and uncertainty. However, your insight and thorough examination led us to a different diagnosis \u2013 OMAS (antibody syndrome). Your confidence and expertise gave us hope when we needed it most.\n\nThanks to your prompt intervention and tailored treatment plan, we have witnessed remarkable improvements in my daughter's condition within just one week. Her movements have gradually returned to normal, and we are filled with gratitude for your timely intervention.\n\nMeeting you was nothing short of a blessing, and we are forever grateful for your expertise, compassion, and dedication to your profession. Your ability to accurately diagnose and effectively treat my daughter's condition has made a profound difference in our lives.\n\nThank you, Dr. Varsha Manohar, for your exceptional care and for being a beacon of hope and healing for our family. We are deeply indebted to you for your kindness and expertise.",
