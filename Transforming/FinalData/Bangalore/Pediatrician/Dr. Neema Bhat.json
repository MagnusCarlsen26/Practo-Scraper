Actually what happens is I took twice an appointment the first time I couldn\u2019t meet her because of her busy schedule then somebody else took into the care that should not happen. She keeps telling me I'll be coming by 3 or 5 pm but she didn't come because I came from Mysore and this should not happen. I am satisfied with the doctor's treatment but the appointment should be confirmed once.",
