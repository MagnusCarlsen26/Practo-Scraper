Someone suggested Dr.Sanjeeva Reddy(thank god for that!).\nHe diagnosed accurately and had my son admitted immediately. With personal interest and dedication, he cured my son soon. After that I never went back to my son's regular paediatrician. I find him warm, approachable and very committed.My son is now a 5 year old. In these 5 years, several times when he has suffered from cold, cough, fever, stomach problems, I just had to pick the phone and call this doctor. Every time he has received the calls and guided me.Never once has he ignored my call. Tell me, how many doctors will do that in this busy world that we are living in. I would absolutely recommend him to all!\n\n",

After that I never went back to my son's regular paediatrician. I find him warm, approachable and very committed.My son is now a 5 year old. In these 5 years, several times when he has suffered from cold, cough, fever, stomach problems, I just had to pick the phone and call this doctor. Every time he has received the calls and guided me.Never once has he ignored my call. Tell me, how many doctors will do that in this busy world that we are living in. I would absolutely recommend him to all!\n\n",
