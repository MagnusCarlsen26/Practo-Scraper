What we most liked about Dr. Rohit is his patience in taking us through his diagnosis, addressing all our queries with a smile on his face and never rushing through an appointment. \n\nAs first time parents, he instilled in us the confidence to battle our baby's various health issues. My daughter had some digestive issues because wheat was introduced early in her diet. She drastically lost a lot of weight and was always constipated. Once he identified the cause, he guided us through the right steps to follow.\n\nThe medicines he prescribes, only if necessary, are of minimum dosage. He encourages a healthy diet and home-made food. The diet charts he shares are very informative and useful.\n\nToday, we have a happy and healthy child and a major share of the credit goes to Dr. Rohit.\n\nWe also visit him for our baby's regular immunizations and it has never been chaotic.\n\nThumbs up to Dr. Rohit!\n",

His normal consulting session lasts as long as 20-30 minutes. I can clearly bet that no other doctor in Bangalore would give so much time and advise to your child's minutest problems. Would definitely recommend you all to pay him a visit once if you are looking for a pediatrician for your child.",

In our numerous visits, we have always found him patient to answer all our questions regarding our daughter's health. \n\nHe is a good counselor and gives us the right tips for parenting. \n \nThankfully, our daughter is healthy and happy now, and a large part of the credit goes to Dr.Rohit.

After visiting, even I would recommend anybody to choose Mr.Rohit as their kid's pediatrician. He explains every single thing to parents with patience. For him, \"no doubt is silly\" and that is what makes us feel good. Being an young parent, every little thing seems  enormously important. He clearly explains 'what needs to be done every month' by parents and how to take care. One other thing which requires mentioning is Mr.Rohit generally advises is to give homemade foods for kids. To me this is very important. I hope this is important for others parents too.",

We came to know about Dr. Rohit from another first time parents and belive me he is really good. He takes time to explain you what stage the baby 8 what as parents we should do about nutrition and other things. For vaccination also he has a good hand. My daughter just does not cry in her last vaccine. \nIf you are in need of a good pediatric doctor then please visit Dr Rohit. ",

My daughter had some digestive issues because wheat was introduced early in her diet. She drastically lost a lot of weight and was always constipated. Once he identified the cause, he guided us through the right steps to follow.\n\nThe medicines he prescribes, only if necessary, are of minimum dosage. He encourages a healthy diet and home-made food. The diet charts he shares are very informative and useful.\n\nToday, we have a happy and healthy child and a major share of the credit goes to Dr. Rohit.\n\nWe also visit him for our baby's regular immunizations and it has never been chaotic.\n\nThumbs up to Dr. Rohit!\n",

Main thing is, he doesn't prescribe medicines when it's not needed. He approaches the situation progressively and steadily. He suggest normal home food for the kids. As a parents, he doesn't make us panic with too many medical terms or problems. That comfort he provides in any situation is very big support for us.  \n\nwe have referred some of our relatives to him and every one share the same feedback after their first visit. \n\nWe would highly recommend him for your kids. If you  are new to the city and don't have an idea about  doctors around, he is the one you can rely on easily. \n\n\n\nThank you Dr.\n\n",

In our numerous visits, we have always found him patient to answer all our questions regarding our daughter's health. \n\nHe is a good counselor and gives us the right tips for parenting. \n \nThankfully, our daughter is healthy and happy now, and a large part of the credit goes to Dr.Rohit.

For him, \"no doubt is silly\" and that is what makes us feel good. Being an young parent, every little thing seems  enormously important. He clearly explains 'what needs to be done every month' by parents and how to take care. One other thing which requires mentioning is Mr.Rohit generally advises is to give homemade foods for kids. To me this is very important. I hope this is important for others parents too.",

The doctor spends time to get the history of the patient, takes time in explaining the diagnosis of the problem and explains in detail the about the medicines prescribed and which medicines for what purpose. Prescribes medicines which are only required. Overall I had a good experience with the doctor rather than the other paediatricians in my locality. I strongly recommend him.",

He recommended us to give 60K dosages of vit D. After 2-3 months of the prescribed medication, we could see lot of changes in our son. He was much active, attentive and also started responding in school. We changed our pediatrician to Dr.Rohit immediately.  \nHe remembers our sons details, every time we visit him and he takes interest in knowing the overall development of the child and not just treating the disease we came for.",
