She not only heard us patiently but asked us many questions related to lifestyle and kid's behavior, which helped to find out the root cause as well as cure my kid forever. Now my kid is hale and hearty with stronger immune system. Words are not enough to appreciate your humble caring attitude. Whenever I see my kid smile and playful, I know, Dr Prachi is behind this heavenly feeling which we feel as parents. \n\nYou are the true living epitome of hope, devotion and care. \n\nThank you for everything once again.",

Only when it is time for her to give medicines only then she prescribes. A multi talented doctor, gives us right suggetions and also gives us time to speak. We don't see this in other doctors who are busy and  don't give us time. we wish Dr Prachi a success, joy and continue with passion always. Thank you Dr.",

She doesn't give time to patients to talk. She was assigned to us by craddle post my delivery as my pediatrician. We pay for consultation even when we visit for scheduled vaccination and then she would be in super hurry , will talk non stop and make you stand to just leave. She won't let you sit in her cabin for more than 5 minutes. There is no time to ask all the queries patiently. Even if you make a list and go, you will forget things due to her high speed train behavior. Will be changing the doctor soon.",

She not only heard us patiently but asked us many questions related to lifestyle and kid's behavior, which helped to find out the root cause as well as cure my kid forever. Now my kid is hale and hearty with stronger immune system. Words are not enough to appreciate your humble caring attitude. Whenever I see my kid smile and playful, I know, Dr Prachi is behind this heavenly feeling which we feel as parents. \n\nYou are the true living epitome of hope, devotion and care. \n\nThank you for everything once again.",

Will defiantly not go to this hospital again.no  Narayanan Hrudralaya again.last year same hospital but different  doctor gave multiple test for 3 yrs kid for normal cold saying it might be swing flue..all reports negative .they just take advantage for parents by saying some big big dieses names",

She knows every child is important and this is because she is also a mom. She is best as she knows that child should be able to get nutrients from food than medicines. Only when it is time for her to give medicines only then she prescribes. A multi talented doctor, gives us right suggetions and also gives us time to speak. We don't see this in other doctors who are busy and  don't give us time. we wish Dr Prachi a success, joy and continue with passion always. Thank you Dr.",

She doesn't give time to patients to talk. She was assigned to us by craddle post my delivery as my pediatrician. We pay for consultation even when we visit for scheduled vaccination and then she would be in super hurry , will talk non stop and make you stand to just leave. She won't let you sit in her cabin for more than 5 minutes. There is no time to ask all the queries patiently. Even if you make a list and go, you will forget things due to her high speed train behavior. Will be changing the doctor soon.",
