"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Children's Health,Paediatric care,Child specialists ,",0,0,YES,"Dr Meena has taken care of my son for the past 10 years now. While he is a teenager now we will never forget how a consultation with Dr Meena helped us feel at ease. 
She is always smiling and explains everything patiently. And one thing that makes you actually feel taken care of is her phrase at the end of every consultation to the child ‘ Feel Better’ . 
That means a lot . 
She was quick to diagnose appendicitis and refer to the specialist in time and she ensured My son was at ease during that time . 
Lot of instances where she was with us and we felt a deep sense of comfort . 
Thanks to her pleasant demeanour and being an excellent doctor !",2021-11-26 12:39:15,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
