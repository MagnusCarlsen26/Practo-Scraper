She had suggested a few tests to be taken immediately next morning. By 7:30am in the morning she had called me up to check how the child was doing and if I found a diagnostic centre to do the tests. Until my child was alright, she followed up. I have not come across a doctor like Dr. Nancy who listens to the problem patiently, so empathetic and makes sure the patient is completely recovered with minimal medicines. Thank you so much doctor for being there for us at that odd hour.",

Then I had given a referral letter to a tertiary children\u2019s hospital mentioning in the referral letter that the child needs examination and investigation to rule out any ICSOL ( intra cranial space occupying lesion / tumour ) .

She had suggested a few tests to be taken immediately next morning. By 7:30am in the morning she had called me up to check how the child was doing and if I found a diagnostic centre to do the tests. Until my child was alright, she followed up. I have not come across a doctor like Dr. Nancy who listens to the problem patiently, so empathetic and makes sure the patient is completely recovered with minimal medicines. Thank you so much doctor for being there for us at that odd hour.",

Then I had given a referral letter to a tertiary children\u2019s hospital mentioning in the referral letter that the child needs examination and investigation to rule out any ICSOL ( intra cranial space occupying lesion / tumour ) . I have not prescribed any MRI . It was in the interest of the child with such complaints that a tumour is ruled out at the earliest .

It's apparent that she really cares about her patients.\u201d My appointment with her was at 11am and I got to see her sharp at 11\u2019o clock which shows she is extremely punctual and disciplined.\n\n\u201cThank you ma\u2019am for doing more than the minimum required; you always do so much more than that for your patients. \u201c\n\n\u201cThank you, all I can say is \u201cthank you. \u201c\nI wish I don\u2019t fall sick or ill but at the same time I would like to meet you again and again.

In all vaccination cases besides going in to the birth history , baby\u2019s growth and development is assessed and I personally administer the vaccine in each case. Furthermore, I am a retired senior doctor who served the Government of India, money is a subservient entity in my practice. It is not understood how I can administer the vaccine with out touching the baby. On checking  the records in this particular case it was seen that all these details have been recorded and some investigation were advised based on the nature of presenting complaints. The baby was seen on 19 th Jan and the feed back was given on 19 th March at 3 am. It\u2019s also unfortunate that Practo doesn\u2019t have a transparent mechanism to verify the veracity of such claims.",
