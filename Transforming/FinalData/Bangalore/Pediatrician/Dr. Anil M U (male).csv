"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Paediatric Critical Care,",0,0,YES,"I visited Sparsh hospital, for immediate critical care for my 8 year old son who had complaints of fever followed by tiredness, headache and eye lids pain & loss of appetite. With no delay, Dr Anil examined the child , listened to the problem and narrowed down the issue. 

My son was in the febrile stage of Dengue, He insisted on immediate IV and blood work to prevent further Dehydration & determine the actual cause. He very neatly explained the stages of Dengue & the need for constant observation to further avoid major impacts & necessary treatments. 

My son was hospitalized for 5 days, his constant observation, detailed explanation, motivational words helped us a lot to get rid of the unknown fear & timely medication helped my child recover within 6 days.
