My son who is now 2.5 yr has been under his supervision right from day 1. God\u2019s mercy coupled with his right diagnosis that I have my kid in my arms today. He doesn\u2019t go overboard with medicines or tests, patiently listens to parents and provides the best solution. Very responsive over WhatsApp or calls which a new parent needs in the initial time. Wish him all the goodness in life.",
