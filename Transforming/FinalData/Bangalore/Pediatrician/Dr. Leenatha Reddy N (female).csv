,,0,0,YES,"If I could give it 100 stars, I would!!!!

Dr. Leenatha Reddy N is a very kind and caring pediatric doctor. (Also, the staff is very friendly and professional).
She provided an exceptional level of care to my SON during his NICU stay. She explained everything to me in a very clear manner.  That was by far the most difficult time of my life. She not only cared for him but for us as well.

Now My Son is doing great which would have been an impossibility without her effort.

I would like to share one incident.
 
On June 9th, 2022 Dr. Leenatha Reddy N traveled overnight from her native to Bangalore. She already made all the arrangements for my son's further treatment (Airway Evaluation with Laryngoscope on 10-06-2022 at Rainbow Children's Hospital Marathalli Banglore.)

We went to Rainbow Children's Hospital from Kinder Hospital along with my 22-day-old baby. My tears are not stopping she is beside my kid in an ambulance. The way she managed the situation hats up. 
Morning 10 AM to 3 PM she did not even take a cup of coffee. She was with my Kid. after the procedure only she went for a break. It shows her commitment and dedication.

That day my respect for doctors was doubled.",2022-08-05 19:28:52,False,True,Chandrasekhar ,,,
,,0,0,NO,"Never make the mistake of consulting her for your child. She never gives an explanation to any question asked; her answer to any concern is always 'it's normal, enjoy the milestone.' She ***** ********* ** ****** *** is always in a hurry. She did not comfort our baby during vaccination and handled very roughly when we didn't opt for a painless vaccine, (I believe it should be a personal choice) starting an argument. *** ***** ** **** *** **** **** * ******* ******* *** **** ********* ** *** *********

I would never recommend this doctor to anyone who wants their baby to be in good hands and receive the right consultation.",2024-03-17 23:12:02,False,False,Mayank,,,
