I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care and support you have provided to my child over the past several years.\n\nFrom the moment we first encountered you, it was evident that you are not just a pediatrician, but a true angel in disguise. Your patience, kindness, and unwavering dedication to your young patients are qualities that set you apart.\n\nI still remember the first time we sought your assistance when my child's finger accidentally got caught in a door. Instead of rushing into the examination, you took the time to calm my child down, listened to her story, and made her feel comfortable before proceeding. Your child-friendly approach to examination truly made a difference and eased our worries.\n\nWhat truly amazed us was your willingness to go above and beyond for your patients. Your availability on WhatsApp, even outside of office hours, speaks volumes about your commitment to their well-being. I cannot express enough gratitude for the prompt assistance you provided during our recent outstation trip when our child fell ill. Your willingness to connect via video call, examine her, and prescribe the necessary medication promptly alleviated our concerns and ensured her speedy recovery.\n\nThanks to your expertise and compassionate care, our daughter was back to her playful self by the next day of our vacation. Your dedication to your profession and your patients is truly commendable, and I believe every pediatrician could learn a great deal from you.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Nandita, you are not just a doctor but a shining example of humanity and compassion. Thank you for everything you do, and may you continue to inspire and heal many more young hearts.\n\nWith heartfelt appreciation,\nMiraya's parents",

Her warm demeanor instantly puts children at ease, creating an environment where they feel comfortable in expressing their concerns. \n\nShe is cautious in her approach to medication. She takes the time to thoroughly assess the situation and doesn't prescribe an overdose of antibiotics and other medicines. This helps in addressing various anxieties that many parents may have about overmedicating their children. \n\nDr. Nandita's support has been invaluable to our family. She has also responded to us during certain situations where she has also replied to us on WhatsApp and has also checked in for the status of the recovery of our daughter. She has recently moved to a new centre of Cloudnine but we are sure that we will move to the new centre only for Dr Nandita. ",

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care and support you have provided to my child over the past several years.\n\nFrom the moment we first encountered you, it was evident that you are not just a pediatrician, but a true angel in disguise. Your patience, kindness, and unwavering dedication to your young patients are qualities that set you apart.\n\nI still remember the first time we sought your assistance when my child's finger accidentally got caught in a door. Instead of rushing into the examination, you took the time to calm my child down, listened to her story, and made her feel comfortable before proceeding. Your child-friendly approach to examination truly made a difference and eased our worries.\n\nWhat truly amazed us was your willingness to go above and beyond for your patients. Your availability on WhatsApp, even outside of office hours, speaks volumes about your commitment to their well-being. I cannot express enough gratitude for the prompt assistance you provided during our recent outstation trip when our child fell ill. Your willingness to connect via video call, examine her, and prescribe the necessary medication promptly alleviated our concerns and ensured her speedy recovery.\n\nThanks to your expertise and compassionate care, our daughter was back to her playful self by the next day of our vacation. Your dedication to your profession and your patients is truly commendable, and I believe every pediatrician could learn a great deal from you.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Nandita, you are not just a doctor but a shining example of humanity and compassion. Thank you for everything you do, and may you continue to inspire and heal many more young hearts.\n\nWith heartfelt appreciation,\nMiraya's parents",

She refrains from unnecessary medications and tries to stick to minimal medical interventions. She is gentle and patient during examinations and she always makes my baby feel comfortable.  \n\nShe has a very chill vibe about her and that calms me down too from overthinking about my babies health and development. I love her quote \u201cdon\u2019t worry so much, it\u2019s normal\u201d \ud83d\ude05.\n\nI recommend her 110%. ",
