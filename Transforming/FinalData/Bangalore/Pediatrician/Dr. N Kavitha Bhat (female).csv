,"Growth & Development Evaluation / Management,",0,0,YES,"After ages met a doctor who was so warm and caring. Right from the word go had warmth in the way she treated the parents and the child.
Not once did she judge the child or label or overwhelm the parents.
She was patient and guided us well. ** *********** *************** ** ********* ** ******
She even administered the injection so gently.. 
She's those rare doctors you find these days .. God bless her ",2024-02-18 12:49:13,False,True,Malini,,,
,"Children's Health,",0,0,YES,"Doctor was patiently listening.  She is very good.

But extremely high waiting time. Staff was also unresponsive.   I had to wait for 1 hr 30 min",2024-05-15 09:53:24,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
,,0,0,YES,"I had visited the doctor on recommendation of my Paed as she is a specialist and was told she will also give the vaccination for my kid. 

Doctor is very good and could guide me pretty well.No issues with the doctor 


Firstly the consultation and registration ( 1250 + 250)  was 1500 And I felt disappointed  And upon that she denied giving vaccination and asked me go back my general paediatrician which is going to cost me another 700 for consultation.

I felt very disappointed by this strategy. I had already mentioned while taking the appointment that I needed vaccination as well. This is how the hospital collects extras the people.
I will not visit this hospital again.

,"Paediatric care,",0,0,NO,We had booked the appointment for 10:40. Aster asked us to come at 10:00. The doctor arrived only after 11 and she saw us only at 2:30 in the afternoon. We waited for 4.5 hours with a 1 year old kid. The doctor and the hospital should seriously look into this as it creates a lot of hassles. Also she should understand that everybody’s time is valuable. It’s a very disappointing experience ,2021-09-18 07:23:31,False,False,Aratrika,,,
,,0,0,NO,"Hospital issue appointment at 9am or some times at 9.30am. Doctor never turns up even if it is 11am or 11.30am and then for every patient she takes one hour though given time is 30mins. Though doctor studies patients well but *** ** *** **** **** ******* ****** **** ** poor time management. Have given direct feedback to the doctor as well. I am sharing my experience as I visited hospital at white field, Hebbal and also JP nagar. Aster hospital itself doesn’t have clarity that where and when this doctor will be available and when she turns up. We have waited for 2-3hrs at very hospital even when doctor is not available and appoint is still offered* ***** ********** ****** ** *** **** ***** **** ********* ** **** ***** *** ******** **** ******* ** ********* Hope doctor will work this on priority.",2021-08-23 05:25:32,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
,,0,0,YES,"The waiting time was more than 1.5 hours, I waited patiently for my turn without raising any noise and when my turn came she tried to rush
She was busy entering the details in system rather answering my queries in a polite way.
