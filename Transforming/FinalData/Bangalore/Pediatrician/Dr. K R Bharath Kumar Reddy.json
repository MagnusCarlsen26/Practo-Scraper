From my experience, I have felt all the staff to be very approachable. The play area is a great idea, atleast kids will be looking forward to visit the hospital. Very neatly maintained hospital. Panel of Doctors at Shishuka are well experienced especially Dr Bharath. He is very approachable, gives a patient ear to listen to all your problems and explains why the medicine is given. My son had ear infection when he was just 3 months old, and after showing him to 2 other doctors for almost a month, it was Dr Bharat's medication that helped him recover. Same with my sister's kid. I hope Dr is able to achieve his vision of \"Heal Happy\". All the best to Dr and the entire Shishuka team! Any time I would recommend to visit this hospital.",

Also, unlike other hospitals, getting an appointment here is way easier. \n\nThe only one thing that the hospital lacks currently is that it is a little unorganized.

From my experience, I have felt all the staff to be very approachable. The play area is a great idea, atleast kids will be looking forward to visit the hospital. Very neatly maintained hospital. Panel of Doctors at Shishuka are well experienced especially Dr Bharath. He is very approachable, gives a patient ear to listen to all your problems and explains why the medicine is given. My son had ear infection when he was just 3 months old, and after showing him to 2 other doctors for almost a month, it was Dr Bharat's medication that helped him recover. Same with my sister's kid. I hope Dr is able to achieve his vision of \"Heal Happy\". All the best to Dr and the entire Shishuka team! Any time I would recommend to visit this hospital.",

We were referred here from Jayadeva Hospital to meet a pulmonologist as they felt the heart issue could be because of the lungs. Since we started treatment here, his lungs are doing better and surprisingly his heart problem also is reducing. We are so happy our heart doctors referred my child to a pediatric pulmonologist in time. Now both his heart and lungs are doing well and we are happy.\n\nAs parents we sometimes don't know where to go and which specialist to meet for some of these problems. Luckily at Shishuka we have all the specialists we needed. We are thankful also to our doctor who referred us on time here. I hope my child's lungs completely heal with time as Dr Bharath Says.",

Kids heal faster in such an environment.\n\nThe hospital and Dr Bharath are so child friendly that it's never been this easy to get her to visit a doctor. One of the finest children's hospital in Bangalore. \n\nNurses are very caring. All services under one roof. Play area and wards are brilliant. \n\nWould highly recommend Shishuka Children's Speciality Hospital to all. ",

It's very important for the baby to be comfortable with the doctor so that they are not scared of hospitals and medicines and Dr. Bharath is a pro at it. Also, unlike other hospitals, getting an appointment here is way easier. \n\nThe only one thing that the hospital lacks currently is that it is a little unorganized. I guess that's because it has newly begun it's operations and the staff is still learning to manage the hospital. I am sure that will improve with time.

I have been seeing nebulization for years now since I am an asthma patient myself and never have I ever seen anyone mixing medicine from 2 respules. Kid was uncontrollable after he started nebulization. I had given nebulization in morning from the same emergency but differed set of people and my kid did not create any fuss. this particular male nurse just turned on the machine and left. we pay 300 rs nebulization charge expecting some help from the person. But he never bothered to check anything. today's episode has made my kid scared about your hospital and nebulization. ",
