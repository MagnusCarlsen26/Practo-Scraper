He listens to all our queries and answers them precisely. He answers all our offline queries (even very silly ones) via phone call or whatsapp anytime. So you feel very comfortable.\n\nMy son had jaundice from day 7 and doctor made sure that all the required tests and treatment were done at the right time. He always called me directly over phone and informed the test results after every test and about what the next action plan needs to be. This happens very rarely elsewhere. Under his care my baby is completely fine now.\n\nI was waiting to write my review after my son's first vaccination so here I am. My baby cried only during the time of injection which was about 2 to 5minutes and after that he was completely fine. I had earlier read a similar review about vaccination and have now experienced the same. Hence I would recommend him for all vaccinations as well.\n \nI would like to thank Dr.Suresh Gowda for all the pediatric care that my baby received so far and would be receiving in future.\n",

When our new born was infected with cold n cough we visited a nearby pediatrician couple of times for our babys treatment but unfortunately there was no recovery but our consultation with Dr. Suresh Gowda was a success. The Doctor is not only kind and patient to listen to our concerns but also provides the best solution in a single visit without needing to consult again. Dr Suresh Gowdas patience* ********** experience and caring expertise is highly appreciated. I would dearly thank and recommend Dr. Suresh Gowda for every child related health issues.",

He listens to all our queries and answers them precisely. He answers all our offline queries (even very silly ones) via phone call or whatsapp anytime. So you feel very comfortable.\n\nMy son had jaundice from day 7 and doctor made sure that all the required tests and treatment were done at the right time. He always called me directly over phone and informed the test results after every test and about what the next action plan needs to be. This happens very rarely elsewhere. Under his care my baby is completely fine now.\n\nI was waiting to write my review after my son's first vaccination so here I am. My baby cried only during the time of injection which was about 2 to 5minutes and after that he was completely fine. I had earlier read a similar review about vaccination and have now experienced the same. Hence I would recommend him for all vaccinations as well.\n \nI would like to thank Dr.Suresh Gowda for all the pediatric care that my baby received so far and would be receiving in future.\n",

He also ensured that my husband had an opportunity to meet our baby in the delivery area before she was moved to NICU.\n\nWe have been consulting him ever since, for our daughter's ailments and vaccinations. Every visit has been marked with his courtesy & competence. He is also responsive to follow up questions over WhatsApp.\n\nBased on our experience Dr. Suresh Gowda continues to be our doctor of choice for our baby girl.\n\nPS: Our daughter appears to be nodding her head over this review ;)",

My baby had jaundice for almost 5 months after birth. Dr. Suresh Gowda kept us calm and patient. My baby is almost a year now and I have been taking my baby to Dr. Suresh Gowda for all his vaccinations as well. Even when I am not in town and my kid falls sick, Dr Suresh Gowda is always available over whatsapp or a normal call. I cannot thank Motherhood Hospital enough for introducing us to Dr Suresh Gowda as he is always there for my kid when needed.

He carries with himself a very rich experience which is pretty evident in his approach towards paediatric care of my baby. He hears you out with Patience and answers all the queries.. never in rush to send you out and attend to another patient..  but the best part is when he gives injections for vaccination to my baby, my son never gets swelling or too much pain.. the baby only cries for  a minute or so and then he is calm..",

Getting confirmation from a professional of the right treatment for my baby comforts me alot. I would like to highlight the fact that the doctor responds on phone when needed, such professionals who are open to help people this way making time out of their busy schedule truly are a blessing and need to be appreciated. This act of kindness indeed is something that is to be respected. \nLastly, I would like to add that the hospital Motherhood has doctors who have the courtesy to honour their patients professionally. Even though the consultation fee is high, it can be afforded considering the treatment, good health and hygienic environment which is most important in anybody's life. ",

I would like to recommend him as he is one of those few doctors who would guide you perfectly with your child's health conditions. He is someone who would prescribe medicines to the child after having a detailed conversation with the parents and then checking the child. He never prescribes any supplements unless there's the actual need. I've come across people worrying about the child's weight and doctors prescribing supplements for weight gain. Dr. Suresh Gowda always ensures you that the weight gain is just a number and as long as the child is active and achieving the milestones it's okay to be underweight and there's nothing to worry about it. He ensures that the child and parents are at ease before starting the discussion about the child's health. ",
