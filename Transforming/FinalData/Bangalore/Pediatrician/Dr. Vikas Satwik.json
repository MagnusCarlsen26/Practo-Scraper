He believes in real time practical solution of problems rather than giving long story to patients. he is patient enough to listen to all your doubts with a smile and is extremely good with vaccination shots. his availability without appointment can be a challenge but his response to emails is always a boon. I strongly recommend him to all new age parents who want to consult a practical doctor yet very modern in his advice. trust me your baby is in safe hands !!!",

It is attached to Motherhood so you have access to any facilities you could want including a pharmacy and specialists. Dr. Satwik is technically excellent so if you don't have any other option at least know his medical training is top notch.\n\nThe bad:\nWe always call ahead because we are travelling quite far, but we always wind up waiting and need to be \"squeezed in\". It's not surprising given how busy they are, but another good reason to find a smaller clinic. Some easy ways to improve service include 1) vaccination days, 2) allow child measuring, pharmacy pickup, and checkin to be done simultaneously, and 3) have enough doctors on staff to accommodate overruns.\n\nI am a high stress first time mother, but I do not appreciate metal health diagnosis from a non-psychiatrist doctor or his staff. We've been here 3 times and aside from the first visit Dr. Satwik hasn't listened preferring \"just do this\" and don't ask why answers.\n\n*** ******* ********* ** **** *** ****** **** *** **** ** ***** *** ****** ** ** ****** ** *** ***** *** ***** *** ********* Children are not all the same and if what you're doing is upsetting the child, give us a moment to calm him or try something else yourself. ***** ******* **** *** ******* *** **** ** *** **** *** ********** ** *** * ***** ********* The staff member was also quite rough.\n\n***** **** ** *** ***** ************** ** **** ***** *** *** *** ******* ********** *** ***** ***** *** **** *******.

My personal request to Dr Vikas would be of he can consult somewhere else apart from motherhood. I will be the happiest person to go there. \n\nMotherhood is a mess in managing the time slots and appointments, they have an excuse every time and they say this is one off's . I have been there 8-9 times and every time its the same story.\n\nThye have issue wit their systems every time I have visited and they say today the system is slow.\n\nThey just lie to you on your face, this has been my experience this time. \n",

He believes in real time practical solution of problems rather than giving long story to patients. he is patient enough to listen to all your doubts with a smile and is extremely good with vaccination shots. his availability without appointment can be a challenge but his response to emails is always a boon. I strongly recommend him to all new age parents who want to consult a practical doctor yet very modern in his advice. trust me your baby is in safe hands !!!",

It is attached to Motherhood so you have access to any facilities you could want including a pharmacy and specialists. Dr. Satwik is technically excellent so if you don't have any other option at least know his medical training is top notch.\n\nThe bad:\nWe always call ahead because we are travelling quite far, but we always wind up waiting and need to be \"squeezed in\". It's not surprising given how busy they are, but another good reason to find a smaller clinic. Some easy ways to improve service include 1) vaccination days, 2) allow child measuring, pharmacy pickup, and checkin to be done simultaneously, and 3) have enough doctors on staff to accommodate overruns.\n\nI am a high stress first time mother, but I do not appreciate metal health diagnosis from a non-psychiatrist doctor or his staff. We've been here 3 times and aside from the first visit Dr. Satwik hasn't listened preferring \"just do this\" and don't ask why answers.\n\n*** ******* ********* ** **** *** ****** **** *** **** ** ***** *** ****** ** ** ****** ** *** ***** *** ***** *** ********* Children are not all the same and if what you're doing is upsetting the child, give us a moment to calm him or try something else yourself. ***** ******* **** *** ******* *** **** ** *** **** *** ********** ** *** * ***** ********* The staff member was also quite rough.\n\n***** **** ** *** ***** ************** ** **** ***** *** *** *** ******* ********** *** ***** ***** *** **** *******.

Thanks to his guidance, I\u2019m still able to breastfeed my baby at 7 months. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t shy away from referring to relevant specialists when needed, in our case a pediatric gastroenterologist. I\u2019d recommend Dr Vikas to all new parents, your baby will get the best care under him. ",

He is an exceptionally gifted doctor who listens patiently to all the concerns of the parent before evaluating the child and prescribes effective medication. He also goes the extra mile and provides timely advice and right references of specialists for certain specific concerns. He is a very positive person and gives parents the much needed reassurance when faced with few challenging medical conditions. His utmost dedication to the medical profession is very evident in his demeanor and approach towards the patient which sets him notches above all the pediatricians we have visited in India and abroad. Even the way he has set up his consultation room makes it look more child friendly and puts the nervous little ones at ease. Yes the waiting time can sometimes be long but for a doctor of this calibre I wouldn't mind the waiting because I'm assured that my baby is in good hands.",
