When called doctor to please check the CT report and diagnose at the earliest so that the pain can be reduced, he says 'I can come only in the morning to check the report'. Then we replied \"if this is the case we will move to other hospital\". He said 'You Please Do It'. He was Just delaying to increase the fee of the hospital and. People understand the carelessness.

When called doctor to please check the CT report and diagnose at the earliest so that the pain can be reduced, he says 'I can come only in the morning to check the report'.
