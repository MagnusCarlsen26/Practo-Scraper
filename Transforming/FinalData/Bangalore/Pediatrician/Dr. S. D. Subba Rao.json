I was able to join back at 5.5 months and my kid has been doing so well under his care. Not too many sick days even though I take my kid to office daycare. He only gives bare minimum medicines required when sick, really like his style and medicating philosophy.\nI would recommend him to all new mothers - his advice is so much more practical and useful than anything you would read online.",

This is what Dr.Subha said when I told the him that I planned to start work in a three months. He asked me why would you...your child needs you..atleast till he is 3....he asked me if I pray to god....what did I pray for when I was pregnant...for a healthy baby...and that me going back to work will compromise his health.....do u need to go to work....I said I do....I need to support my family and take care of my parents....he said u don't really need to....u need to prioritize your child...if u don't, then he will fall sick from time to time...You can go to work...God is great, he will take care of your child anyway.....\n\nI ended up crying in front of him(as I was already anxious about my sick child and had visited the hospital without my husband accompanying me...had to do first time registration with a crying baby in my hands).\n\nI understand that he must be fed up of working parents bringing in their sick children to the hospital and asking for advice. So he must have got angry or frustrated.\nBut you have to keep in mind that we cannot afford a hospital like Manipal on a single income. If he meant what he said, he should practice at a place that doesn't charge so much.",

He asked me why would you...your child needs you..atleast till he is 3....he asked me if I pray to god....what did I pray for when I was pregnant...for a healthy baby...and that me going back to work will compromise his health.....do u need to go to work....I said I do....I need to support my family and take care of my parents....he said u don't really need to....u need to prioritize your child...if u don't, then he will fall sick from time to time...You can go to work...God is great, he will take care of your child anyway.....\n\nI ended up crying in front of him(as I was already anxious about my sick child and had visited the hospital without my husband accompanying me...had to do first time registration with a crying baby in my hands).\n\nI understand that he must be fed up of working parents bringing in their sick children to the hospital and asking for advice. So he must have got angry or frustrated.\nBut you have to keep in mind that we cannot afford a hospital like Manipal on a single income. If he meant what he said, he should practice at a place that doesn't charge so much.",
