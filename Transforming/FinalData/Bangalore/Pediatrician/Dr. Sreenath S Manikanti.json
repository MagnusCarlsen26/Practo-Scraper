Five years ago, my world was turned upside down when my twins arrived prematurely. It was an emergency delivery at 29 weeks, babies weighing just 1 kilogram each, but Dr. Sreenath guided us through every step of the journey with expertise, compassion, and unwavering dedication. It was almost a 2.5 month journey for our babies in the neonatal section.From the moment we met doc Sreenath, it was evident that we were in the hands of a true professional. His vast knowledge and experience in neonatology reassured us during a time of great uncertainty. He took the time to explain every aspect of our twins' care, addressing our concerns with patience and empathy.Throughout the NICU stay and beyond, he provided personalized attention to our twins, tailoring their care plans to meet their individual needs. He closely monitored their development, ensuring that they reached important milestones despite being born prematurely. His presence brought a sense of comfort and reassurance, turning what could have been a daunting experience into one filled with hope and optimism.Today, as our twins turn 5, we are filled with gratitude for Dr. Sreenath's instrumental role in their journey. Thanks to his unwavering dedication and expertise, our twins have flourished into happy, healthy children, defying the odds every step of the way. He will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and we are eternally grateful for the profound impact he has had on our family. Thanks doctor!!Ragitha & Bijoy",

Your child had high grade fevers and raised infection markers. On investigations we found out that your child was suffering from infection of outflow tract of the kidney ( pyelonephritis ) . We had to upgrade antibiotics as infection was not responding to 1st or 2nd line antibiotics. Finally we managed to be on top of the infection ! Glad your son is doing well \ud83d\ude0aThank you for your co-operation & choosing Kauvery.",

Five years ago, my world was turned upside down when my twins arrived prematurely. It was an emergency delivery at 29 weeks, babies weighing just 1 kilogram each, but Dr. Sreenath guided us through every step of the journey with expertise, compassion, and unwavering dedication. It was almost a 2.5 month journey for our babies in the neonatal section.From the moment we met doc Sreenath, it was evident that we were in the hands of a true professional. His vast knowledge and experience in neonatology reassured us during a time of great uncertainty. He took the time to explain every aspect of our twins' care, addressing our concerns with patience and empathy.Throughout the NICU stay and beyond, he provided personalized attention to our twins, tailoring their care plans to meet their individual needs. He closely monitored their development, ensuring that they reached important milestones despite being born prematurely. His presence brought a sense of comfort and reassurance, turning what could have been a daunting experience into one filled with hope and optimism.Today, as our twins turn 5, we are filled with gratitude for Dr. Sreenath's instrumental role in their journey. Thanks to his unwavering dedication and expertise, our twins have flourished into happy, healthy children, defying the odds every step of the way. He will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and we are eternally grateful for the profound impact he has had on our family. Thanks doctor!!Ragitha & Bijoy",

Through this note I just want to convey my words of thankfulness to him. \n\nMy wife had delivered our Son at Fortis LaFemme under Dr. Pratima Reddy and it was there we came across Dr. Sreenath who heads the Pediatrics department there. \n\nAll was well for the first 15 days for my baby until the 16th day when he got high grade fever ranging up to 104.2F. He was not taking his Mother\u2019s milk and continuously crying incessantly. Utterly concerned with the unusual fever at this stage, we rushed to the hospital where he was delivered to find Dr. Shalini. \n\nUnderstanding the gravity of situation she recommended to admit my infant in NICU immediately. She contacted Dr. Sreenath and made him aware of the situation. He was given  paracetamol to bring down the temperature but there was no relief whatsoever. He continued to make painful sounds. \n\nDoctor Sreenath diagnosed my baby the next day Morning and suggested a series of medical tests including the CRP, PCT and others. The initial reports suggested late onset of sepsis which is nothing but the bacterial infection.  He recommended antibiotics with the likes of amic acid and peptas which helped in his treatment to a great deal. Later to understand the root cause he suggested Molecular DNA test to understand the presence of micro-organisms and treat with the right medicine. Dr. Sreenath prescribed complete 15 day anti-biotic treatment so that  the infection does not haunt back in my neonate. \n\nI vividly recall in his first counselling he explained the situation being empathetic truly sensing our concern. I cherish his words that he treats every children like his own and give his best. He even consoled my wife uttering in hindi, our mother tongue, though not his. I was amazed with his compassion and passion towards his job. \n\nWhat amazed me was his accuse sense of personal responsibility. ** ** ************* ******* listens to the patients/guardians well and does best to provide the right treatment with a phased approach ensuring the problem is treated from root level and not just the surface. Dr. Sreenath is a Go-To Doctor when it comes to your pediatric needs. \n\nThank you and God bless. \nNarendra Gupta \n\n",

I honestly can't say enough great things about Dr Sreenath and what he's done for our daughter. He's a very talented and passionate doctor who's given exceptional care to our daughter. We've had some rough rides with Aaliya and Dr Sreenath has helped us get through it all and helped us find the appropriate help for her. He's extremely polite, ************* and always ready to help any child when required which is not something we experience very often now a days. I'm an overly paranoid mother and Dr Sreenath is always there to answer my questions and to reassure me or to suggest the right treatment for our daughter even though he has an extremely busy schedule. Dr Sreenath is one of the very few doctors I've met who really cares about his patients. Recently he was available to assist and give advice to one of my friend's daughter who was not even his patient. Such pediatricians are very rare to find now a days. As a first time mother, knowing that your kid's doctor is always there to provide any medical advice to you is truly comforting!We're so grateful to have Dr Sreenath to take care of our daughter Aaliya! Thank you for always being kind and for genuinely caring. ",

We immediately consulted the doctor and he changed the formula feed to Nutramigen. The blood in the stool has stopped but however I observed that he had discomfort in digestion and he started to mourn, when I took him to doctor I understood that he is not only intolerant to lactose but also to cow's milk protein.  We did the required tests and the result was positive. Doctor switched to Neocate from Nutramigen and the baby is fine with this feed. Simultaneously I had to stop consuming milk and curds as the baby is not able to digest. This has resolved the feed issue.\n\nAlso due to my hormonal changes he had neonatal acne and the doctor suggested Atogla and Ritch lotion to subside the itchiness and red rashes that had occured on his face. I could see the results in a day's time and my baby stopped crying\n\nIn summary, Dr Srinath diagnosis infant issues with lot of patience, he listens to parents and the baby concerns. He puts a lot of effort to ensure the issue is treated immediately. I would like to thank him for the right diagnosis to my child *** * **** ** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** **** ** ********** What also surprises me is that he is also available for video consultation whenever I have asked :)\n\n",

During the vaccination Dr. Srinath noticed this and identified it as umbilical granuloma. Dr. Sreenath advised me to apply rock salt on the red lump and cover it with a band aid. I had my own doubts if it will hurt the baby, or if we can apply any cream instead. Dr was patient enough to help me understand this. Much to my surprise the red lump dried within half and hour of application of rock salt. When I repeated the same the second time the lump disappeared and the belly button healed completely. It was an inexpensive treatment that worked wonders. Dr. Sreenath does not suggest any expensive medications for any issue with the new borns ,  he only suggests natural and effective ways. He is a subject matter expert and does not just gives medicines, instead he takes time, asks questions , only after patiently receiving complete information he prescribes medication. Thank you doctor, may you continue your good work!! God bless",

As he tells always that he treats every child is like his own child is truly felt by is. He is such a kind hearted doctor. We shall always be grateful to him and will recommend him as one of the best doctor as well as human being we have ever met. ",

He shared a success story of his other patient with us one time and helped us in gathering more strength. Though the situation was tough, the doctors managed to get through the period without needing to perform any surgery on our kids.

We were explained the potential risks and treatment plan from Day1 and the doctor and his team made sure that preventive treatment including phototherapy is given without waiting for matters to aggravate. this helped immensely. Dr Sreenath's patience response to our anxious questions really gives a soother. what stuck us was that Dr Sreenath with his experience of plus 25 years of handling these matters made sure that baby lives with the mother throughout with regular monitoring. I am extremely thankful and highly recommend Dr Sreentha for neonatal care. thank you sir for all that you have done for us. feels blessed!Aditya & Neha Marodia",

Thanks to his experience and the fatherly support, we could go through that phase relatively easily. He never misses even one counselling session with the parents, never ever make you feel worried and also ensuring that the correct information is passed on to the parents. His attitude towards the use of technology as well as natural techniques for the treatment is quite noteworthy. Even after taking the baby home, he is available throughout and that gives us so much confidence in handling the new born baby. He is one of the doctors who can be relied upon for receiving the best neo natal support as well as paediatrics. ",

Our baby was delivered at Fortis and about a week old, when he started developing frequent vomiting, refusal of feed and weight loss. Dr. Sreenath suggested re admitting to NICU as he suspected some infection. After further tests, his instincts were spot on and his treatment greatly solved the issue and put our baby back on the growth track. Thanks to his timely intervention, we're so relieved to see our baby normal and with us at home now. Even after the delivery, he was always approachable and answers all our queries during counselling and helped us absorb the stress of dealing with a pre term. Despite his calibre, he is very kind and friendly and this makes us worry free in our journey ahead. We know we always have Dr. Sreenath and his team at Fortis. Thank you doctor. We're sure you will play an important role in our beautiful journey ahead.",

The facilities were well-equipped to cater to the unique needs of premature infants. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was modern, clean, and maintained a serene environment conducive to healing.\nI\u2019m thankful to Dr Sreenath sir and team, the proactive nursing staff like Hema, Ranjana and all other sisters whose names I forgot for all the care and the emotional support provided was invaluable.\nThey also proved to be a cost-effective option for families like ours who needed specialized care without the burden of exorbitant expenses. For 39 days of NICU care they charged around 7.25L which is at least (30-40)% less compared to other hospitals. ( Note: Bill of insured patient is marginally less than cash, so please get insured self and your family)\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend the hospital to families seeking intensive care for their premature babies. The hospital's dedication to delivering high-quality medical treatment is truly commendable.",

He advised us to get our baby admitted to the hospital nicu as it maybe sepsis or other issues.Our baby was diagnosed with pyloric stenosis the following day (Sunday) after blood and urine tests x-rays and scans. It came as a shocker to us. We didn't have clarity on it. Dr. Sreenath explained issue clearly. Surgeon Dr. Sreedhar Murthy BN was consulted. He explained the surgery procedure in detail. Both reassured us and gave confidence. Our baby underwent the surgery on Monday. Was on IV for Monday. Dr. Sreenath advised to start feeds. Feeding was increased gradually while IV was reduced gradually. Baby was doing well. Discharged on Wednesday.We came back home happily. The issue of vomiting, looking dull, weak, tired and inactive stopped.Baby is doing amazingly well now.Had we postponed or delayed going to the doctor, the severity would have increased with other complications.High regards to Dr. Sreenath Manikanti. A doctor giving assurance and confidence is what helps us get through the challenges and confusions. ",

After examination he told us it's a breast abscess & needs treatment with antibiotics. We started oral antibiotics for 3 days which didn't seem to help. After consulting again, he started IV Antibiotics & hoped for it to resolve. He even had a Cross reference with a Pediatric Surgeon right then As I was worried if this abscess required an Incision & Drainage. His frequent call for Follow-ups & regular examinations made me feel calm about the situation & helped us deal with this in the best way. After a 7 day course , the swelling has now almost completely come down. No admission or Surgical procedure was needed , for which I will forever be grateful.Dr. Sreenath is Excellent when it comes to diagnoses & initiating the best immediate Care when required. He will listen to all your queries & answer them patiently. For new Mother's like me this is truly a blessing! He explained that neonates shouldn't get Breast massages as suggested by most Aayas while giving the baby a bath. Though this wasn't the case with us , he made me aware that majority of breast related issues in neonates happen when milk is expressed from the breasts, which shouldn't be done.   A household common Myth that does major Harm. Thank you Dr.Sreenath for Everything!",

Our records show that we\u2019ve seen your nephew  Shreyan on 27th July for vomiting after feeds and he has been diagnosed as Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux, which is a common condition in some babies. According to guidelines started on 1st line medication & advised prop up position after feeds. Is some babies with GER , these symptoms can last until they start sitting @ 6 months of age. Unless there is frequent vomiting leading to loss of weight, further escalation of treatment is not warranted. Antigravity measures suffice. This condition needs regular follow up. I\u2019ve lost Shreyan for follow up. \nIf the symptoms are worse , we can consider escalation of treatment. I offer free follow up Consultation, Plz ask his parents to bring him back & I\u2019ll look at the issue afresh.",

High degree of fever doesn\u2019t translate into a sick child. We look for warning signs, since there were no warning signs associated with fever , I reassured and didn\u2019t give any other medication except to help with the fever.

Once the result came Positive, doctor guided us and gave appropriate medication. She had a mild symptomatic infection. Thanks to the doctors' timely medical advise, we were able to handle those tough times. She is doing fine now with no symptoms.

On searching for better doctors, we came across Dr. Manikanti and decided to take a second opinion. We found his way of handling the babies, explaining the issue and the line of treatment very thorough. He out our minds to ease, especially now when our son is under going treatment for a UTI that he contracted recently. His meticulous approach towards solving the issue has given us swift and more than satisfactory results. He understands what parents go through and counsels them as well. It has been a rewarding experience. ",

I just hope that you understand that I\u2019m a Neonatologist & Pediatrician and not a behavioural therapist. I wish I had a magic wand to clear away behavioural problems in 15 minutes , which child psychologists take 5-10 sessions to deal with !!!My appointment slots are for 15 minutes only so that I can see all my waiting patients. \n\nI do conduct parental workshops voluntarily to educate parents regarding positive parenting. That\u2019s the service I do voluntarily to help children have better parenting at home. I screen Children for any behavioural problems and refer to the right people if they need any help. Parenting and behavioural issues need longer one to one sessions of 60-90 minutes to sort out the issues. \n\nAs a pediatrician my job is to identify any red flag signs and decide which therapist to refer depending on my assessment of the child and family. I remember that I spent at least 30 minutes with you and your child, despite 4 patients waiting outside to see me. I\u2019ve Assessed your child\u2019s development and ruled out red flag signs which need immediate attention. After having ruled out major psychological illnesses, I reassured you and gave some tips on positive parenting and how to work on his behaviour. I referred you to a specialist who can help you further. These issues take some time to work on and need one to one sessions with the child. I suggest you to find by yourself a good child psychologist & behavioural therapist and take few one to one sessions to work on your child. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of much help to you in this regard. I wish your child a good health & bright future.",

It was indeed challenging for us to care for such an extreme premature & very low birth weight baby without administering any blood products ! I had to do a bit of research to find alternate ways of treating these babies safely & effectively. It\u2019s is a very rare and challenging case. It\u2019s a team effort. I\u2019m glad we successfully managed to discharge the baby safely, without using any blood or blood products as prohibited by your faith. Wish your baby a robust health. Thank you for choosing Fortis La Femme NICU care for ur baby.",

If at all antibiotics are required, should be restricted to simple antibiotics & aim is to avoid use of higher antibiotics. I rarely prescribe antibiotics to my patients. However ur 5 month old was having pus in the ear with middle ear infection. It needs to be treated promptly to prevent the risk of this infection spreading to the nearby structures including brain. I've prescribed 1st line antibiotics, which is very safe as recommended by American Association of Pediatrics. If you've any further queries, plz get back to me. \n",

Sorry for the inconvenience caused- our receptionist had gone to get her COVID vaccine that day & same was communicated to you over phone that doctor will be 5 min late . Your appointment was at 11:45 AM & doctor arrived at 11:50 AM from the Hospital. You had told our receptionist that you were waiting from 11:30 AM. We have the call recording. Normally clinic is open at 10 AM , so if patient arrives early they can wait in the waiting area. That day was an exception. \nWhen doctor saw you , you didn\u2019t inform the doctor that ur consultation was prepaid in Practo. All prepaid customers should scan QR code in the clinic so that Consultation is paid to the doctor by Practo. That was also not done. Hence you were charged Consultation Fee + Vaccinations. We charge all vaccinations on MRP & we don\u2019t charge any additional amount. In fact doctor had showed u the vaccination boxes & exact price, same was charged to you. We\u2019ve kept the video recording of the same. \nWhen we realised in the evening that it was supposed to be prepaid after generating the detailed billing by our receptionist , we apologised for the oversight & promptly refunded the extra amount to you over google pay. But we are yet to be paid by Practo for the Consultation as receptionist was not there to get you scan the QR code. \nWe value our patients and always strive to provide best possible experience. Your inconvenience is regretted.",

Although I had blocked my appointments by 2 pm , I could leave only after 4 pm after seeing all my patients as it was busy ! I was telling my staff not to take any more walk-ins, but would honour all my appointments. Looks like there is some misunderstanding! I understand patients come to me from far off places, I always make sure that I attend to all of them before leaving . There are many days when I had lunch at 4:30 pm but I\u2019m not complaining. I understand that patients come to us with lots of hope and try to do our best. We medical professionals are under constant scrutiny \ud83e\uddd0, not all of our good work will be recognised but even a small mistake will be highlighted ! Unfortunately that\u2019s how it is. Patients have right to express their views freely. \nAfter returning to India , I learnt to just to focus on what I can do best for my patients even at the cost of my personal life ! Work-Life balance is something that is very difficult to achieve in India. Life is complex, we keep learning every day !\ud83d\ude42",

I very rarely prescribe antibiotics and your son presented with a massive lymph node swelling in the neck which needed antibiotics. I generally prescribe very less investigations , however your child case was different. Whenever child presents with such a massive swelling it\u2019s always prudent to investigate to find out the cause. Simply giving antibiotics without any tests can sometimes mask underlying disease such as TB or Malignancy. Hence I recommended the tests, which are standard protocol in any good hospital. Also majority of kids who present with such massive swelling may not respond to oral antibiotics, which is a fact.",
