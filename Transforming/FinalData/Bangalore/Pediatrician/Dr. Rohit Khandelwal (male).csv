"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pediatric Vaccinations,Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,"I generally take doctor's advice with utmost seriousness provided the doctor is very trustworthy & genuine. In Dr. Rohit's case I found the same and followed likewise. He insists on taking care of the babies in the most basic and natural ways. I remember during my baby's breastfeeding period, I told the doctor about my exhaustion and tiredness to continue so, but he  firmly insisted that I provide nothing but only breastmilk to my baby for first 6 months, and I did follow as he suggested. Now I surely see the result. I recommend Dr. Rohit for his genuine advises and guidance. Thanks. ",2020-01-23 06:36:47,False,True,Smriti Sasmal,,,
