We did and then when we went to show the reports, he asked me to pay the consultation fees again even to go through the reports. When I said that it is first time in my life that for followup consultation to just show reports, i need to pay 1150/- while other doctors dont charge in cloudnine. To this, he replied that he is specialist and has to use his brain, so we need to pay full amount for the reports as well. Never seen such a doctor in my life. I told that i will pay and come and to that, he mentioned that he wont see the x-ray reports as it will take time.  Be careful from such person, he can be a specialist but definitely not a person to go to. ",

We did and then when we went to show the reports, he asked me to pay the consultation fees again even to go through the reports. When I said that it is first time in my life that for followup consultation to just show reports, i need to pay 1150/- while other doctors dont charge in cloudnine. To this, he replied that he is specialist and has to use his brain, so we need to pay full amount for the reports as well. Never seen such a doctor in my life. I told that i will pay and come and to that, he mentioned that he wont see the x-ray reports as it will take time.
