"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Childhood Infections,",0,0,YES,"My 5-year-old child had a high fever for over five days. I had consulted two doctors before seeing Doctor Lini, but they couldn't diagnose the issue and kept recommending Crocin to control the fever. Upon examining my child's face, eyes, and ears, Doctor Lini confidently identified an acute bacterial infection and immediately started IV antibiotics without waiting for any test results. Her confidence was remarkable, and my child began recovering the next day. The test results later confirmed typhoid. Doctor Lini's treatment, reassuring smile, and comforting manner with parents are exceptional. I highly recommend her.",2024-07-11 04:32:35,False,True,Faizan Siddiqui,,,
