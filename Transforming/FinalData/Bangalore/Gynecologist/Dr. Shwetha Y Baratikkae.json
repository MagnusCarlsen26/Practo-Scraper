Now for others who are thinking to consult Dr.Shwetha ... please don't delay. I can assure you  .. you will be in safe hands. I have been visiting her for couple of months now, and this is my second review. Me and my husband had very hard time convieving. We had no idea what to do, even after going to several doctors. A friend suggested me to consult the doctor once. Since then, it has been smooth journey with Dr.Shwetha. She is always patient, calm and commited. Thanks to her I'm finally pregnant. She has been more than a Doctor to me. Motherhood is very precious thing and for helping me with this, Doctor you will alway have a special place in my heart. I had the opportunity of interacting with others who come to visit, who have much more complicated conditions. And have seen doctor taking utmost care of them.  Special mention to the staff there. I know everyone by name and everybody knows mine. Because they are that friendly. ",

We underwent all kinds of infertility treatment and spent lakhs together money but there was no result. \nFinally we went to meet Dr. Shwetha Pramodh at Tamara hospital keeping no hopes. She welcomed us with a pleasant smile, heard our problem, gone through our previous reports and said we have no problems to conceive.\nShe took one cycle to evaluate our problems and treated us in the next cycle which made our lives worth living, yes it turned out to be positive!!! We have long way to go for full term pregnancy but as our doctor being there with us we have no worries at all.  \nWe are ever thankful to Dr. Shwetha Pramodh for making our lives so beautiful. \n\n",

However, as a last hope we consulted  Dr Shwetha referred by one of our friends. I feel emotional and excited today as I am writing this review about Dr Shwetha , I felt confident in the first visit itself, each appointment was worth the visit and lead us to our dream of having a baby. Yes! I\u2019m pregnant now, in such a short span it\u2019s only 6 months I have been consulting.. Dr Shwetha has given me the most precious gift in my life, we are so fortunate to have connected with you Dr, you are much more than I ever  would have thought could find in a doctor, thank you for your medical, mental emotional, motivation, positive attitude  and spiritual support, you have made such a big difference in my  life I\u2019m grateful to you. Any one trying to conceive and lost hope, trust me never lose your hope as you will never regret your decision of meeting Dr Shwetha. Its Blessings.I would also like to include about the staff members who are very supportive, friendly and always cooperative. A big Thank you to Dr Shwetha and all the staff members. :)",

Unfortunately, my last visit Saturday was highly disappointing, as I found the approach of both the staff and the doctor to be severely lacking in customer-centricity and transparency.\n\nUpon arrival, my wife and I were directed to a consultant downstairs, where we provided all relevant information about our situation. Subsequently, we were sent to Dr. Shwetha, who spent a mere minute discussing our concerns before referring us to her assistant for further assistance.\n\nHowever, my dissatisfaction escalated when it came time for billing. Without consulting anyone else, the receptionist demanded a payment of 5000 rupees and handed us a bill labeled as an \"unwanted kit\" for the same amount. When I requested a breakdown of the charges, I was astonished to see various fees listed, including 600 rupees for the consultant, 500 rupees for scanning, 390 rupees for another consultant, and a staggering 3510 rupees for \"written doctor names.\" When I questioned this, I was told it was a government fee, which seemed dubious at best.\n\nFeeling misled and frustrated, * ******** **** **** * ** ** *** ****** ****** ** ****** * **** ************ *********** However, upon further discussion with Dr. Shwetha herself, I received no satisfactory explanation or resolution. Instead, all medications and prescriptions were abruptly taken back, and my wife and I were asked to leave.\n\nIt is deeply concerning that such practices are allowed to persist in a medical establishment. Patients have the right to transparent and fair billing practices, as well as respectful treatment from healthcare professionals. My experience has left me questioning the integrity and ethics of Janisthaa Fertility Clinic and its staff.*** **** ******* ****** ** ******** *** ******** **** *** ****** *** * ******* *** ****** ** ******* ** ***** ********* *** ******** *** ****** ** ***** ********* No one should be subjected to such treatment, regardless of their financial status.",

Having been referred to bigger hospitals in Bangalore and nothing really working with enough medications and spending huge, we were still disappointed and had no clue how do we go about this issue. Finally a very close friend of mine who was visiting India, also consulted Dr. Shwetha with similar issues,  recommended me to her. At the first appointment with Doctor itself I was completely convinced that I am at the right place. The very fact that she is calm and gives personal attention and time to listen to us makes me comfortable. I really like the approach of doctor towards such a sensitive issue. I completely recommend Dr. Shwetha Pramod to anyone who is been trying to conceive and have seen doctors without any results. ",

Now for others who are thinking to consult Dr.Shwetha ... please don't delay. I can assure you  .. you will be in safe hands. I have been visiting her for couple of months now, and this is my second review. Me and my husband had very hard time convieving. We had no idea what to do, even after going to several doctors. A friend suggested me to consult the doctor once. Since then, it has been smooth journey with Dr.Shwetha. She is always patient, calm and commited. Thanks to her I'm finally pregnant. She has been more than a Doctor to me. Motherhood is very precious thing and for helping me with this, Doctor you will alway have a special place in my heart. I had the opportunity of interacting with others who come to visit, who have much more complicated conditions. And have seen doctor taking utmost care of them.  Special mention to the staff there. I know everyone by name and everybody knows mine. Because they are that friendly. ",

We underwent all kinds of infertility treatment and spent lakhs together money but there was no result. \nFinally we went to meet Dr. Shwetha Pramodh at Tamara hospital keeping no hopes. She welcomed us with a pleasant smile, heard our problem, gone through our previous reports and said we have no problems to conceive.\nShe took one cycle to evaluate our problems and treated us in the next cycle which made our lives worth living, yes it turned out to be positive!!! We have long way to go for full term pregnancy but as our doctor being there with us we have no worries at all.  \nWe are ever thankful to Dr. Shwetha Pramodh for making our lives so beautiful. \n\n",

I consulted a Fertility centre Milan in JP nagar which gave us no results inspite of visiting for 3 long years. I was completely broke down mentally, physically and financially.. However, as a last hope we consulted  Dr Shwetha referred by one of our friends. I feel emotional and excited today as I am writing this review about Dr Shwetha , I felt confident in the first visit itself, each appointment was worth the visit and lead us to our dream of having a baby. Yes! I\u2019m pregnant now, in such a short span it\u2019s only 6 months I have been consulting.. Dr Shwetha has given me the most precious gift in my life, we are so fortunate to have connected with you Dr, you are much more than I ever  would have thought could find in a doctor, thank you for your medical, mental emotional, motivation, positive attitude  and spiritual support, you have made such a big difference in my  life I\u2019m grateful to you. Any one trying to conceive and lost hope, trust me never lose your hope as you will never regret your decision of meeting Dr Shwetha. Its Blessings.I would also like to include about the staff members who are very supportive, friendly and always cooperative. A big Thank you to Dr Shwetha and all the staff members. :)",

Unfortunately, my last visit Saturday was highly disappointing, as I found the approach of both the staff and the doctor to be severely lacking in customer-centricity and transparency.\n\nUpon arrival, my wife and I were directed to a consultant downstairs, where we provided all relevant information about our situation. Subsequently, we were sent to Dr. Shwetha, who spent a mere minute discussing our concerns before referring us to her assistant for further assistance.\n\nHowever, my dissatisfaction escalated when it came time for billing. Without consulting anyone else, the receptionist demanded a payment of 5000 rupees and handed us a bill labeled as an \"unwanted kit\" for the same amount. When I requested a breakdown of the charges, I was astonished to see various fees listed, including 600 rupees for the consultant, 500 rupees for scanning, 390 rupees for another consultant, and a staggering 3510 rupees for \"written doctor names.\" When I questioned this, I was told it was a government fee, which seemed dubious at best.\n\nFeeling misled and frustrated, * ******** **** **** * ** ** *** ****** ****** ** ****** * **** ************ *********** However, upon further discussion with Dr. Shwetha herself, I received no satisfactory explanation or resolution. Instead, all medications and prescriptions were abruptly taken back, and my wife and I were asked to leave.\n\nIt is deeply concerning that such practices are allowed to persist in a medical establishment. Patients have the right to transparent and fair billing practices, as well as respectful treatment from healthcare professionals. My experience has left me questioning the integrity and ethics of Janisthaa Fertility Clinic and its staff.*** **** ******* ****** ** ******** *** ******** **** *** ****** *** * ******* *** ****** ** ******* ** ***** ********* *** ******** *** ****** ** ***** ********* No one should be subjected to such treatment, regardless of their financial status.",

Having lived abroad in USA and gone through a Medical Termination of Pregnancy over there, we moved to India with no idea whom to consult on my issues with PCOS and conceiving.  Having been referred to bigger hospitals in Bangalore and nothing really working with enough medications and spending huge, we were still disappointed and had no clue how do we go about this issue. Finally a very close friend of mine who was visiting India, also consulted Dr. Shwetha with similar issues,  recommended me to her. At the first appointment with Doctor itself I was completely convinced that I am at the right place. The very fact that she is calm and gives personal attention and time to listen to us makes me comfortable. I really like the approach of doctor towards such a sensitive issue. I completely recommend Dr. Shwetha Pramod to anyone who is been trying to conceive and have seen doctors without any results. ",

She was always available over phone to answer queries and staff in Blossom clinic are very supportive.\n",

After 30-35 minutes one doctor done some basic medical check up and written his comments. After his check up we waited for almost 2-2.30 hour for main doctor<Think her name is shwetha pramod>. Nurses were telling she went on OT. Finally my wife went her to show previously written comments. But bad luck is she doesn't have patience to listen her problem. she was in urgency, didn't looked report as well, didn't ask what is the problem also. My concern is if she is busy then she could have ask to come next day, instead of telling you don't have any issue. Off-course we have some problem then only we are going to hospital, otherwise to simply spend money and time who will go to hospital.\r\nSo my sincere request is if you are free, if you have time then only give appointment, simply told tell you don't have any problem",
