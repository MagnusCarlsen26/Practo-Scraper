So, we decided to consult her for pregnancy check ups, we were happy about the covid safety measures taken in her clinic.I had my own birth plan like breastfeeding in the 1st one hr, delayed cord clamping and skin to skin. Dr.Aparna agreed to all of it and I was totally satisfied when she mentioned that she practices all of it. So, we convinced our parents to have the delivery in Bangalore itself instead of our native.The pregnancy went on really smooth, did walking, squatting, yoga and was active throughout the pregnancy,ensured not to gain more weight. Doctor also promised 99% for normal delivery inspite of the low water level. She suggested us to admit in Rainbow hospital in my 37th week as the baby was in Cephalic position and 2.9 kgs of weight. I was induced on Jan 25th around 8 pm, I started getting contractions but I did not dilate. Still the doctor in the ward told we will try for normal delivery till 26th Jan 12 noon if the fetal heart rate is stable. From midnight my contractions were intense, but I dilated only 3 cm by 26th Jan around 9.30 AM. Baby was distressed by then, the fetal heart rate was going down.Dr.Aparna suggested us to go for C- section, in less then 10 mins they shifted me to the operation theater. She had a wonderful team in Rainbow children's hospital, Bannerghatta road they swiftly made all the arrangements and I delivered  a boy baby on 26th Jan, 10.19 AM.Baby was distressed, he had mild respiratory issue. He was shifted to NICU immediately, the doctors in the NICU took the necessary care. He was shifted to the ward in 30 hrs and we got discharged on 28th Jan. My sincere thanks to the doctors and the staffs in NICU for the treatment and care provided. Service provided at Rainbow hospital was impressive.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Here my journey starts with Dr.Aparna ma'am.
When I googled about her I found very positive reviews about normal deliy.I also read different opinions about her but I strongly recommend her name and I will tell you the reason why.
So first of all I am Dr.Renu a physiotherapist. I had to go through a phase of miscarriage in my first conception and I was very sad and worried thinking what will happen in my  second time conception.When I came to know about Dr.Aparna I decided to meet her in my 2nd month . Though I was hesitant when I met her for the first time because she didn't explain me in detail. But when I went for second visit she explained to me everything about my pregnancy and then on things started to look very nice and smooth.I started to gain trust on her.Suddenly 6th month and onwards my pregnancy had some complications like Gestational diabetes,Cholestasis jaundice,severe itching,my haemoglobin was also very low and on top of these I was overweight. Since I am from medical background I could understand these problems and tried to take care of these as per doctor's guidance.Because of my complications doctor said she will do induced labour on 37th week and try for normal delivery.But until you see your baby out and everything is fine you don't really accept everything what doctor says.I was scared and worried.Finally the day came when I had to undergo induced labour. I got admitted in Rainbow hospital, nurses started to give medicines to induced pain but my pain and dilatation was not progressing as expected till next morning.Then doctor quickly decide to break the water and checked how much i had progressed. After that my pain started to progress. I was coping up with pain by doing gentle breathing exercises. When my pain become high I started getting tired. My doctor had suggested me for epidural but I wasn't ready for it and said i will bear the pain. Being a physiotherapist I was aware of side effects of  epidural and wanted to avoid it. As my pain was progressing further I was becoming very tired and started to think if this continues I will lack with energy and won't be able to deliver normally and then I quickly decided to take epidural. By this time I had dilated only 4cm.
Now my epidural procedure went very smooth and experienced no pain after that and dilatation was progressing. After that I delivered normally.
Dr.Aparna handled my case very well. I was really amazed by her experience of handling the situation and taking quick decisions. At that moment I really felt blessed to be having my baby under her hands..I cannot thank her enough for what she did for us...I highly recommend Dr.Aparna ma'am especially to those who are looking for normal delivery in Bangalore.
After taking epidural and having painless normal delivery I strongly recommend to take epidural and enjoy painless delivery because I feel it's a blessing for people like us who do not want to take labour pain and still have smooth normal delivery.
Nowadays normal delivery is becoming a rare thing and when we get to know someone have normal delivery we feel very happy. And same happened to me. I am blessed with a baby girl weighing 2.9 kg and all because of ma'am.
Thank you so much ma'am for taking such a good care of my pregnancy..
Thanks a lot.",2021-04-10 15:49:28,False,True,Renu Kumari,,,

Mam had a clear conversation with me regarding my family planning and suggested I should hold on for sometime and get treated for PCOS first so that I can conceive naturally. 6 months of treatment and I was ready to conceive. However, due to personal commitments, I had discontinued medication and consultation for a few months and tried conceiving on my own. After 3 failed attempts,I went back to Aparnaa mam for help. She immediately recognized me and had a hard talk regarding my discontinuity of medication. However, I was determined this time and with mam's help I was able to conceive within a month. My pregnancy journey has been super smooth. I was lucky enough to not have any complications and those 9 months have been the most amazing months of my life so far. I was due on April 29th and the Covid 19 situation was really getting into my nerves. On my end term scan, doctor told me that baby was in a position for normal delivery.But I was so paranoid with the lockdown situation and post recovery stories from my friends about normal delivery that I didn't want to get into any kind of emergency situation and requested mam for a planned c section. Aparnaa mam tried to explain me that every body is different and it's not necessary that I would go through the same things that my friends experienced. She was determined to have my mind set into normal delivery and she assured nothing would go wrong. As fate would have it, my water broke 2 days later , i.e on 4th April and I got admitted to Rainbow hospital immediately. Aparnaa mam visited me in the evening and explained that I had to be induced as I had not gone into labour yet. She was courteous enough to ask me if I want to get induced or go for c section. I opted to follow what she feels is right for me. 15 hours into labour but my baby was in no mood to come out 😊. Finally had to go for c section at 10am on 5th April and got blessed with a baby boy. Post operation recovery was very quick and it felt like breeze.

Dr. Aparnaa has been the light bearer throughout my pregnancy journey right from week 5 until week 38 when i delivered. Although she may come off as a very strict gynae, but in reality that’s exactly what is needed for a healthy pregnancy. I was at a risk of gestational diabetes and high BP but thanks to her constant vigilance and diet charting, i made it through without any need for medications at any instance for the above while being active throughout my pregnancy (driving to work until 1 week prior to delivery)

She answered each and every query of mine patiently(even with diagrams), be it originating from myths from family and friends, google-researched scientific data or just silly random thoughts in the head. One very good and convenient thing about Dr. Panda is that she remembers her patients’ history and answers all your questions on whatsapp texts.

Lastly i would like to write that had it not been her and her excellent team of practitioners in scrubs at the labour room/OT, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to have a normal vaginal delivery at any cost; given the fact that i had signed a written consent of C-section in case of emergencies.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,I visited doc Aparnaa in the month of July 2021 after reading positive review on Google and practo. On my first visit I was anxious and bit worried as this was my first pregnancy but Dr. Aparnaa was kind enough to answer all my doubts. Thereafter I started visiting her regularly. My due date was in 1st week of March but my water broke on 28th January 2022. I was not sure whether really my water broke or was it something else. I visited Dr. Aparnaa for confirmation and she immediately told me to get admitted in Rainbow Hospital Bannerghatta. By the time I reached hospital I was in labour and pain increased as time passed by. Dr. Aparnaa came and visited me in Rainbow Hospital and told me that they won't be doing anything to stop or induce labour. Dr. Aparnaa was in constant touch with duty dr. Enquiring about my health condition. Since the pain became unbearable by 5.30 I went for epidural and I was told that I would be delivering between 8-10pm. After taking epidural at 6pm the pain reduced for an hour and again it started by 7pm. By this time Dr. Aparnaa had come to labour room and set everything for delivery. At 7.41 I delivered baby girl normally. Since my baby was about to be delivered way before it's due date I was scared whether I'll be able to deliver normally or have to understand c-section. But with Dr. Aparnaa's support and hospital staff's help I was able to deliver normally. I would any day recommend Dr. Aparnaa for normal delivery. I am very thankful to Dr. Aparnaa for making my pregnancy journey smooth and memorable.,2022-02-09 06:02:32,False,True,Amulya,,,

I came across Dr Aparnaa Panda, on my first visit to the doctor I felt she had a different approach compared to the others who I visited in the city. Her approach gave me the results I was seeking. Since then I have been consulting Dr Aparnaa Panda and it's been 3 Years from then. The reasons for visiting her each year was different. My recent visit was to confirm my pregnancy. Thereafter, throughout my pregnancy, from Day 1 she has been very cautious and ticked all basic checkpoints to make sure the baby is safe at every milestone until the delivery. She kept a close watch on my monthly follow ups and monitored regularly on my sugar and BP levels to make sure the baby is not at risk at any time. She doesn't take even 1% chance in a high risk situation. Even during my admission to the hospital, she and her staff followed up with me until I was hospitalized and took necessary steps to induce normally. With 16+ hours of inducing and with very little dilation. She took up a decision that's time sensitive and delivered our little bundle of joy in no time. Dr Aparnaa Panda is a very straightforward, hardworking, efficient and approachable doctor. You will get to know these traits when you visit her. And yes, she is strict when you don't follow up her instructions for your own good.
My experience with Dr Aparnaa Panda and her staff has been great! They have been nothing less than sincere, upfront and satisfactory at every level. Her approach and solutions towards the problems are very unique. She is a strict observer and follower of how your body responds and treats accordingly. She takes your inputs and feedbacks seriously at all times and answers all your questions. (It's best to get all your questions written on a notepad so that you don forget to ask her). However, She is available on WhatsApp to help answer your questions otherwise.
With time and results seen, I would definitely recommend her if you are looking for a good OBGN to help you.",2021-11-09 12:47:54,False,True,Sumayya tabassum,Thanks Sumayya. Wishing you a very happy Motherhood,2021-11-14T17:32:55+0000,Dr. Aparnaa Panda

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I clearly remember the day I walked into Dr.Aparna's clinic all anxious after knowing about my pregnancy. We chose to visit her as her name top the list on Google even though when you read some of the reviews it might mislead you. We (me and my husband) as individuals always believe in having our own experience than believing in social media reviews which are mostly used to vent out anger but very few people would want to write about the good experiences coz who cares ?! I felt like sharing mine coz this should help someone in determining the right decision. The 9 months of my pregnancy journey with Dr.Aparna has been extremely satisfying. The way she has handled all my queries throughout and explaining complications if any, I can't thank her enough for her care, promptness and honesty. I would specially want to mention one of my crucial and life changing experience with her as a covid  mother who have just delivered a healthy baby boy, for which i have the highest regard for her. I had severe chest infection due to covid during my 35th week of pregnancy and had to be hospitalised in SOS. The way she had handled my case from helping me admitted in emergency to keeping me in priority without even thinking once that shifting me to another top hospital (who has better covid treatment facility than the maternity specialised hospital I was admitted in) in the city of Bengaluru during the last weeks of my pregnancy which ideally means is letting your patient go at the end moment, but she chose my health on top priority and advised us on the real time situation. During any emergency she was just a WhatsApp away for my queries. The clinic has super supportive staff, well managed patient queue and all the necessary arrangements an expecting mother would look for. Highly recommend Dr.Aparna and personally would want to stay in touch for any of my future gynec related issues. Best wishes to the team.",2021-06-02 12:50:35,False,True,Satabdi Sharma,,,

I visited Dr. Aparnaa when I was 4 months pregnant. She went through all old reports and explained everything. When I asked doctor if I can go for normal delivery, I was amazed to see how doctor encouraged us and 
gave us believe that she will definitely try for normal delivery first, C-section is 2nd option though I had gestational diabetes. 

As it was my first pregnancy, so me and my husband had lot of doubts. Aparnaa ma'am always answered all queries with lot of patience. She is so friendly in nature and same time she is strict on certain guidelines like; diet, regular walking which is actually good for pregnant mother and baby's health.

During covid lockdown, when many clinics are closed, Dr. Aparnaa never stopped looking after her patients. She always told me to keep in touch with her through Whatsapp.

I was nervous thinking how my delivery will be done during lockdown. But Doctor gave us relief and trust that she will be always there to take care of her patients whether it is lockdown or not. Even if pregnant mother becomes covid positive, she will never leave her patients. This is best thing you can hear from a doctor at this situation and I will be always grateful to Aparnaa Ma'am for that.

I will highly recommend Dr. Aparnaa to everyone whether you are planning for normal delivery or c-section delivery or any maternity related problem. Once you visit her, you will not regret your decision.",2021-05-14 12:21:42,False,True,Shayon Samanta,,,

This review is just a small token of thanks for her . Words are not enough to express our gratitude for Dr Aparnaa Panda.  

We wanted an initial scan and that too in the lockdown period.  Most of the well known Hospitals and Clinic (including the Doctor whom we visited before lockdown) refused to do a scan. We saw a review on google and visited Dr Aparnaa Clinic . She adhered to all the Corona Specific guidelines in her Clinic and that impressed us. She did the initial scan and has given minimal medicines to start . She explained about the diet importance and some daily exercises to be done and was too soft to my wife while explaining all. No unnecessary tests or medicines prescribed by her in the entire tenure. We faced another  setback during the 35 weeks of pregnancy when we (all family members) got infected to COVID-19. In this tensed situation we talked to  her even at  mid-night (without hesitation) . She suggested us some medicines and some precautionary measures to be taken. She was in regular  touch with me and my wife , taking all daily health updates during our home quarantine. She was always interested  in a normal delivery . After getting admitted to Rainbow on 5th Dec, she tried her best for the normal delivery. Thing got slightly complicated when the baby heart rate went too down and later baby has passed motions.

Yes I remember it was so difficult to keep our clinic open during the pandemic. Initial days of the lock down, I had to convince our staff to come to the clinic. They we so scared and the police used to harress them on the way. We had to keep our board light off and some other anxious patients in Ranka colony used to come and ask us every alternate day whether we were open or not. In that period, your wife had come to me in a very anxious state due to her previous bad experience and I am vey happy to provide the best of support during the pandemic.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Heavy Periods,",0,0,YES,"I would like to start by saying that Dr Aparnaa is god to me because she has saved my life. I have been living in US for more than a decade and I was under the impression that doctors/treatment available in US are best but that is a complete myth. I was having heavy period for past 6-7 months continuously and was getting treated here in US. Doctors in US prescribed me medicine name “Provera” which made my situation really bad and due to that I had so much of loss, my blood count went down to 5 and I had to go through blood transfusion in US. US doctor could never figure out the actual problem and kept giving me high dose of “Provera”. After 6-7 month of going through struggle and almost loosing my life due to so much of blood loss, I decided to take opinion from Doctor in India and that’s where I came in contact with “Dr Aparnaa Panda”. She looked at all my US medical reports, explained possible issues. She was worried about the treatment I was getting in US and recommended me to travel to India so that she can look into the problem/solution in right way. After 2 week of my virtual appointment with Dr Aparnaa, I came to India and met her in her clinic. She immediately took action and prescribed many tests to figure out the actual problem. She gave me few medication that I took for 4 days and my bleeding almost stopped. I had surgery done on 6th day by Dr Aparnaa after my bleeding was stopped and the whole process from start to end took 10 days. I am treated 200% for my problem in 10 days by Dr Aparnaa which US doctors could not even figure out in 7 months. She kept her check on me post surgery and gave advices for fast recovery over Whatsapp. I just can’t imagine what situation I would have been if I wouldn’t have contacted Dr Aparnaa.

Hello All,This is my second review previous one is before delivery this is after delivery. i know how the reviews are important for individual to choose the doctor as i also gone through as every one and found awesom Dr Aparna Panda (we consulted only her). I will list my experiance.
1. Waiting time - MAXIMUM 15 mints on an average. Except in rare case that is bcz like us some one need her help,kindness,smile in labour ward.*** *** ********* **** ********* **** *** ********** Along with Yoga and Walking.
3. Need patients - she needs some time to study your body bcz all medicine will not suite all person its based on individual.my suggestion nothing will happen overnight be patient and have positive thoughts and believe her.
4. Choosing right hospital. We are very much comfortable with her so we took her suggestion to go with RAINBOW. Because she will take care of delivery because she studied my wife body for past 15 months(9months pregnancy + 6 months). As she knows her which treatments need to give, how to treat my wife also there is bond formed bw my Doctor and my wife.  in this case my wife was comfortable to express her feelings during labour pain.
5. Delivery - we expected NORMAL delivery. She gave full hope and support along with her team dr - sumitra nurse - subhasini,anita). More than that when delivery time is close by always you can reach to her dont worry about time. She is always ready to hear you even during labour pain. Only HUSBAND is allowed in labour ward so i am telling you.

I strongly recommend DR Aparna Panda for PREGANANCY from starting till you get beautiful baby in your hands.
Believe in HER she will take care all things.

THANKS A LOT mam for all and for our ANGEL.

She is exceptional and has taken care of like a gem.I can't express enough gratitude for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Aparnaa throughout the pregnancy journey and the challenging NVD. From the very first prenatal visit to the delivery room, Dr. Aparnaa demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to ensuring both mine and my baby's well-being.Dr. Aparnaa'a attentiveness and dedication were evident from the beginning. Regular prenatal check-ups were thorough, and any concerns or questions were met with patience and clear explanations. The doctor's calm and reassuring demeanor helped alleviate anxieties that often accompany pregnancy. No unwanted medicines were prescribed, a healthy diet was suggested by the doctor and I was able to keep the vitals under control along with body weight.What truly set apart was the prompt response during the crucial moments of the delivery. As I got the labour pain, we reached the hospital and informed the doctor, the doctor's ability to reach the hospital in no time, very early in the morning, played a crucial role in ensuring a safe and successful delivery.Throughout the labor process, Dr. Aparnaa maintained a perfect balance of professionalism and empathy. Clear communication and genuine concern for both me and my baby's well-being were evident at every step. The doctor's expertise was evident, and the calm presence provided much-needed reassurance during a crucial situation by which I was able to give birth naturally to a healthy baby boy.The postpartum care was equally exceptional.  Doctor continued to monitor both my recovery and the baby's health, ensuring a smooth transition into motherhood. The consistent follow-up appointments further highlighted the doctor's commitment to their patients' long-term well-being.Dr. Aparnaa is not just a skilled medical professional but a genuine lifesaver.

I got to know about her from google reviews and started consulting her from the very first day of suspect of my pregnancy. She is a very professional doctor, neither used any sugar-coated words nor prescribed any unnecessary medication. This has been our 1st pregnancy and being totally unexperienced, she guide us like a friend and supported us with prompt response through whatapp on any minute health related issues. Since I am bit obese with a family history of hypertension, she suggested me to stick to a very controlled diet and following her instruction the entire 9 months had been the most amazing and easy-going experience one can ever think off. I gained very minimal weight during this time and thanks to God, did not suffer from any added complications of gestational diabetics or high blood pressure. Following her guidelines, I must happily admit that I was able to fit into my regular dresses even on the 9th month of pregnancy. Not only about looks, I was able to carry on with my regular chores and office works without any discomfort till the last moment of pregnancy, until the water broke. This happened just the next day of visiting her on my 37th weeks and she too warned me to be prepared as she observed that I have already started to dilate. Although I got admitted to Rainbow hospital just after the water broke, I was not getting pain and she suggested to medically induce labor. Even then the labor processed very slowly and I was hardly getting any contractions. A heartfelt thanks to doctor and the support staff in the hospital as they have been extremely patient and waited for 19 hours to let it happen naturally. Interestingly, towards midnight I felt light contraction and was put on epidural, which soothed my pain. Right after that, again thanking God here, as my baby too held long along with me and that dilation started to progress naturally. Early in the next morning I was fully dilated and doctor proceeded with normal vaginal delivery. Thanks to all the supporting doctors and nurses in the labor room as I couldn't have done it without their push. Within 30-40 mins Aparna maam handed me my bundle of joy and it was such a wonderful feeling to see the body I was nurturing within my body. I would give all credit to her for such a smooth and satisfactory experience of the otherwise know extremely painful process and helping me delivery a healthy boy and support my post process recovery as well.
Finally, me and my husband are very glad and count ourselves fortunate to have consulted Aparna maam and her supportive team of radiologist, nurses, consultants and receptionist for their prompt and adequate response in time of need. I will always recommend my friends, family and acquaintances to consult her for any Gynae-related problems.

We consulted the Doctor and honestly she went through my wife's all medical history regarding the pregnancy and gave us enough time. She was very much careful in treating my wife through out the pregnancy. She has given necessary medicines to sustain the pregnancy. My wife went through several pregnancy complications, but she has guided and treated well in all the stages.

She treat her patient very kindly, but sometimes she gets angry for the patient well being. And this is fair enough to get angry with the patients if they do not listen to doctor advice :)

Finally, when I admitted my wife for the delivery, I was little worried as she was having some complications, but Doctor handles all the process very well and we were blessed with healthy baby boy and healthy mother.

Doctor tried her best for normal delivery, but it was not possible because of complications and we went for C-Section.

The medication and flowup they did was so good . Doctor responded to all our query during the consultation and if there any medical emergency doctor was available over the phone anytime ..

After conceiving  we were hoping for the normal delivery and also the track record of normal delivery by Aparna doctor was very good .. 

During the pregency period she took good care by doing regular scanning/blood test  and provided medications based in the reports .

At the 8th month due to food infection ( Outside junk food) we had severe 
vomitting and doctor suggested for three bottles of drips after which vomitting got reduced.
And during the 9 month after general scanning doctor the stomach of baby was little big .. By doubting it doctor suggested for blood test and in which sugar levels was bit high for normal delivery was quite difficult at that time . 

In the next day had a severe pains and got admitted to Rainbow hospital it was almost night 10:30 duty doctor did a NST and shared the reports to doctor Aparna , the pulse rate of the baby was less than 100 which was difficult for normal delivery and we had a call with Aparna doctor and agreed to keep in observation for some more time there was a severe pain and doctor suggested for Epidural injection for painless delivery and was in a continues observation .
It was around 7:30 i think doctor Aparna came for the check and did internal checkup as she observed bleeding and started with the delivery procedures and final it was like a film climax everything was too fast and it was a baby boy with Normal delivery .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"First of all, thanks a lot ma'am for making our family complete and sorry for posting review so late.
I have been consulting Aparnaa ma'am for last 2 years since i was diagnosed with hypothyroid and minor prolactinoma. But despite all these complications, I conceived naturally just because of her guidance. When we decided to have a baby, our primary concern was to deliver a baby through NVD. From 1st month of pregnancy until delivery, Aparnaa ma'am guided us throughout each stage. She always welcomed us with a bright smile, which made us feel positive and confident and listened to all our small queries, which we came across. I simply followed her invaluable medical advice and as a result, i had a smooth and healthy pregnancy. She always insisted on eating healthy food rather than taking unwanted medications. Moreover, she always responded to queries whenever needed no matter what the time it is, which is truly appreciated. Under her able guidance, i had a normal delivery. We blessed with a baby boy on 23rd May.
On 22nd May, i visited ma'am for my last pregnancy checkup and that day ma'am told us that my amniotic fluid level wasn't sufficient and so the delivery cannot be delayed. We went for RT PCR test immediately since i was told to get admitted to the hospital the moment i received my covid report. But my baby had his own plans. My labor pain started on 22nd May around 1pm after i returned to my home. I reached at the hospital at 6:30pm. The pain got intense around 7pm. Around 12:30am,I was only 7cm dilated. Despite my insufficient amniotic fluid level and excessive bleeding, Aparnaa ma'am tried her best to deliver my baby normally. But my cervix wasn't ready to be dilated more. At last, ma'am Decided to go for C-Section. I was shifted to OT. Ma'am checked my cervix for the last time. And surprisingly, i was fully dilated by then. Ma'am was so happy and she decided to go for vacuum delivery. At last, my baby was delivered through NVD thanks to ma'am. I would like to say thanks to the team of Rainbow Hospital who took care of me and my baby very well.
In a nutshell, her calm demeanor, expertise, and experience make her patients feel assured that they are in the safest hands. We are happy and satisfied to have Aparnaa ma'am in our lives because of which my pregnancy ended on a happy note.

I would strongly recommend Dr. Aparna for Normal delivery and she is a masterpiece in Gynaecology and obstetrics. She is one of the most inspiring and admirable doctor i have ever seen.

In the seventh month we have visited Dr. Aparna madam (at care diagnostics)and she encouraged,  motivated & given enough confidence for normal delivery. After consulting her, there was no fear of C-Section. She has great commitment and patience.

I am extremely thankful to Dr. Aparna madam for taking right decisions at the right time during labor (40 hours of labor). Day and Night she was available for us  over phone calls, whatsapp and visited when required. No doctor would have waited for such long time in hospital.

After getting intense contractions we went to  Rainbow Hospital at night 1:30 A.m (27th march). and Aparna madam suggested to stay in observation room.
NST test was performed continuously to monitor baby health , even in the Midnight  3 am madam answered calls and given suggestions.

After 36 hours of labor, cervix was only 2 cm dilated.   very  less progress in dilation. Duty doctor suggested to go for C-section. We lost hope for normal delivery and in complete disappointment. Dr. Aparna was continuously monitoring , over phone calls with Nurse and duty doctor entire night from 11:30 pm to morning 7 :30 Am.

Suddenly Dr. Aparna came to hospital in the morning time and taken right decision & changed medications which helped for the dilation of cervix from 2cms to 10 cms & delivered baby successfully on March 28th.

Pregnancy related - Everything was fine till 5th month, my baby growth was healthy as per Doc. However the moment we shared that we were planning to get the delvry done in our hometown, my pregnancy condition became high risk with hypertension being the reason. Not sure why for first 5 months it was not highlighted but only told when we shared our travel & delivery plansI came to my hometown, visited new gyno, got a good one thankfully who reduced my meds and also told that my pregnancy is normal, no hypertension or anything to worry about.

She told us what to expect, and what precautions will be required even if we put the stitch. She even gave us an option of how not to go for the stitch and still manage the issue.
But we were very scared and to be on the safer side opted for the stitch.
After the operation, my wife was kept in observation for two days and then sent home. Dr Aparnaa kept in touch with  my wife and via whatsapp.
