She shared her expertise on the fibroid which allayed my fear and guided me on fertility and pregnancy related concerns. Dr. Aparna lend her expertise in every step of my pregnancy journey. She kept a caring eye not only on the fetus but also on the uterine fibroid . Since the uterine fibroid's size increased during the pregnancy , doctor advised that a myomectomy (removal of fibroid) can be done along with c-section which will prevent multiple surgeries. We went ahead with that advise and it was the best decision taken. Just after the c-section delivery , myomectomy was performed to remove the fibroid. I recovered in 2-3 days( in terms of pain and being up and about on my feet). \nI am really thankful and grateful to Dr. Aparna Jha for my smooth pregnancy journey , child delivery and removal of fibroid. I couldn't have received better care from any other doctor.",

It was because I had huge fibroids in my uterus which caused miscarriage once. And I had visited atleast 4-5 doctors who firmly said pregnancy is not possible until fibroids are removed with myomectomy. Even if I undergone surgery they wouldn't promise I can get pregnant again as they saw very less chances.\nWith all the pain in our life me and my husband decided to try again and leave faith in god. Just after I got positive test results, we have booked our first appointment with Aparna Jha. And first thing she did was making me mentally ready for everything with still asking to keep faith and she would try her best to help us with pregnancy. Here I saw the first difference with other doctors who had concluded my uterus capability on my first visit. Dr.Aparna Jha was supportive, a strong motivator, never gets too much emotional but still understands, prepares the patient physically and mentally. She was available on phone, WhatsApp, online appointment whenever neccessary. Also, on my last day of delivery at midnight 12 where I had water break. I would say she handled all of situations perfectly that I did not even panic with water breaking.\n\nToday, while we are writing this review I have a son of 18 months old who is sleeping in between me and my husband reminding us all of the happy tears when he was born.  We are now living a happy life where we never forget how much Aparna Jha mean go us.\nI know is took me so long to write this here, but I say it again she is always comes to our mind.\n\nFun fact: Me and my husband  call her Appu or Bihar ki Sherni when talk about Dr.Aparna Jha \ud83d\ude09\n\nKeep us the good work and we meet again when we cross the roads.\n\nBr, \nSreelekha, Abhilash and Agastya",

We had a high risk pregnancy but under Her guidance, care & treatment we are blessed with a baby boy through normal delivery.From the first day of consultation with her, we felt that we are in safe Hands. She is caring, listens to our problems & does not hurry. She explains the issue in details. She is reachable over phone call & chat. She is always positive which makes us internally think positive & bold. *** **** *** ********* *********** ********* * *** ****** In the 3rd trimester, complications started but She handled it very efficiently with minimal medication. As I said earlier, ours is a high risk pregnancy because of earlier 3 miscarriages but then also under Her treatment it was not only a full term pregnancy but also a normal delivery which we haven't thought of. ***** *** ** * ****** *** ** ** * *** * ******* ***** Earlier we consulted several Doctors on major cities like Kolkata, Delhi & Hyderabad but all in vain. We always feel that GOD connected us with Her & She in the form of GOD gave us a new life with the bundle of joy.We don't know how to thank her but We pray to GOD that She gets more strength, courage & blessings so that She continue to do the good work & Her work gets recognized. We all know the complications of c-section, so I urge to all the couples not only in Bangalore but throughout India, if you want normal delivery for high risk pregnancy also & if it is possible to come to Bangalore, then take Her guidance & treatment so that we can see more & more success stories in the future.

Here is why we wouldn't recommend this place:\n\n1. The hospital doesn't have an ICU for the mother - atleast that's what we were told when my wife had suffered a seizure from eclampsia - so if you need\nBP monitoring as a result of pre-eclampsia in an\nICU setting you don't have the option\n2. The BP measurement is manual at the OPD which means if you have borderline BP increases the nurses measuring your BP in 30 seconds fall to identify subtle signs of high BP. Prior to my wife developing eclampsia we visited the hospital twice following high BP measurements on home machine but the readings at hospital were \"normal\" according to nurses\n3. ** ****** *** ****** ** ********* ***** ** ************ **** ****** we told her about BP readings at home, feet swelling, rapid weight gain, headache. Her diagnosis was have Dolo and stop measuring BP at home. She didn't even suggest a urine test to look for preeclampsia! She somehow even failed to suggest a 28 week scan that other hospitals recommend. As a result my wife developed pre-eclampsia and eventually eclampsia over new years weekend when the doctor was on leave. We had to do an emergency C section and delivered at 32 weeks ***** **** ********* ******** ****** ** ******** **** * ***** ************ ** ********** Even after high wait times at OPD at this hospital we ended up with this outcome.\nDoctor didn't even provide any phone number for expressing any concerns till it was too late.\nThese maternity hospitals are a factory with 10min consults with the more \"sought-after\" doctors not being sufficient for anyone to be properly diagnosed.****  * *********** ** **** *** * ********** ********* ******** **** * ******* ********",

The baby was only 3.16kg but she was very worried about the weight and started becoming desperate and concerned about why I am not feeling any labour pain. She said she wants to do a pelvic exam and I said ok and during the pelvic exam she performed membrane sweep without asking me or discussing it with me. Later she informed that she has performed a membrane sweep and I was shocked but I didn\u2019t say anything as I trusted her.

She shared her expertise on the fibroid which allayed my fear and guided me on fertility and pregnancy related concerns. Dr. Aparna lend her expertise in every step of my pregnancy journey. She kept a caring eye not only on the fetus but also on the uterine fibroid . Since the uterine fibroid's size increased during the pregnancy , doctor advised that a myomectomy (removal of fibroid) can be done along with c-section which will prevent multiple surgeries. We went ahead with that advise and it was the best decision taken. Just after the c-section delivery , myomectomy was performed to remove the fibroid. I recovered in 2-3 days( in terms of pain and being up and about on my feet). \nI am really thankful and grateful to Dr. Aparna Jha for my smooth pregnancy journey , child delivery and removal of fibroid. I couldn't have received better care from any other doctor.",

It was because I had huge fibroids in my uterus which caused miscarriage once. And I had visited atleast 4-5 doctors who firmly said pregnancy is not possible until fibroids are removed with myomectomy. Even if I undergone surgery they wouldn't promise I can get pregnant again as they saw very less chances.\nWith all the pain in our life me and my husband decided to try again and leave faith in god. Just after I got positive test results, we have booked our first appointment with Aparna Jha. And first thing she did was making me mentally ready for everything with still asking to keep faith and she would try her best to help us with pregnancy. Here I saw the first difference with other doctors who had concluded my uterus capability on my first visit. Dr.Aparna Jha was supportive, a strong motivator, never gets too much emotional but still understands, prepares the patient physically and mentally. She was available on phone, WhatsApp, online appointment whenever neccessary. Also, on my last day of delivery at midnight 12 where I had water break. I would say she handled all of situations perfectly that I did not even panic with water breaking.\n\nToday, while we are writing this review I have a son of 18 months old who is sleeping in between me and my husband reminding us all of the happy tears when he was born.  We are now living a happy life where we never forget how much Aparna Jha mean go us.\nI know is took me so long to write this here, but I say it again she is always comes to our mind.\n\nFun fact: Me and my husband  call her Appu or Bihar ki Sherni when talk about Dr.Aparna Jha \ud83d\ude09\n\nKeep us the good work and we meet again when we cross the roads.\n\nBr, \nSreelekha, Abhilash and Agastya",

We had a high risk pregnancy but under Her guidance, care & treatment we are blessed with a baby boy through normal delivery.From the first day of consultation with her, we felt that we are in safe Hands. She is caring, listens to our problems & does not hurry. She explains the issue in details. She is reachable over phone call & chat. She is always positive which makes us internally think positive & bold. *** **** *** ********* *********** ********* * *** ****** In the 3rd trimester, complications started but She handled it very efficiently with minimal medication. As I said earlier, ours is a high risk pregnancy because of earlier 3 miscarriages but then also under Her treatment it was not only a full term pregnancy but also a normal delivery which we haven't thought of. ***** *** ** * ****** *** ** ** * *** * ******* ***** Earlier we consulted several Doctors on major cities like Kolkata, Delhi & Hyderabad but all in vain. We always feel that GOD connected us with Her & She in the form of GOD gave us a new life with the bundle of joy.We don't know how to thank her but We pray to GOD that She gets more strength, courage & blessings so that She continue to do the good work & Her work gets recognized. We all know the complications of c-section, so I urge to all the couples not only in Bangalore but throughout India, if you want normal delivery for high risk pregnancy also & if it is possible to come to Bangalore, then take Her guidance & treatment so that we can see more & more success stories in the future.

Here is why we wouldn't recommend this place:\n\n1. The hospital doesn't have an ICU for the mother - atleast that's what we were told when my wife had suffered a seizure from eclampsia - so if you need\nBP monitoring as a result of pre-eclampsia in an\nICU setting you don't have the option\n2. The BP measurement is manual at the OPD which means if you have borderline BP increases the nurses measuring your BP in 30 seconds fall to identify subtle signs of high BP. Prior to my wife developing eclampsia we visited the hospital twice following high BP measurements on home machine but the readings at hospital were \"normal\" according to nurses\n3. ** ****** *** ****** ** ********* ***** ** ************ **** ****** we told her about BP readings at home, feet swelling, rapid weight gain, headache. Her diagnosis was have Dolo and stop measuring BP at home. She didn't even suggest a urine test to look for preeclampsia! She somehow even failed to suggest a 28 week scan that other hospitals recommend. As a result my wife developed pre-eclampsia and eventually eclampsia over new years weekend when the doctor was on leave. We had to do an emergency C section and delivered at 32 weeks ***** **** ********* ******** ****** ** ******** **** * ***** ************ ** ********** Even after high wait times at OPD at this hospital we ended up with this outcome.\nDoctor didn't even provide any phone number for expressing any concerns till it was too late.\nThese maternity hospitals are a factory with 10min consults with the more \"sought-after\" doctors not being sufficient for anyone to be properly diagnosed.****  * *********** ** **** *** * ********** ********* ******** **** * ******* ********",

The baby was only 3.16kg but she was very worried about the weight and started becoming desperate and concerned about why I am not feeling any labour pain. She said she wants to do a pelvic exam and I said ok and during the pelvic exam she performed membrane sweep without asking me or discussing it with me. Later she informed that she has performed a membrane sweep and I was shocked but I didn\u2019t say anything as I trusted her.

From the initial days she encouraged me to have a healthy diet and exercise even before conceiving. In January my pregnancy got confirmed and from day 1 she was there to help me. There was spotting in second and third month but gradually things became fine. She encouraged to have an active life though out my pregnancy which helped in getting my baby head down. On delivery day my water broke and went to hospital around 2 AM still she responded to duty doctors how to handle. They induced me as there were no sign of contractions. It was difficult delivery with little heavier baby and Aparna ensured me to have normal delivery. And removed placenta manually. If anyone else would have been there, they would have done C-Sec but as promised she went with normal delivery(instrument involved). Also she never gave unnecessary tablets or asked for any scans. She recommended only relevant stuff during pregnancy. Even after my delivery when I got gallstones , when we contacted her she responded to undergo surgery. Overall she was so friendly, sweet , available and a hardworking passionate doctor that I have ever seen. Love her a lot. \u2764\ufe0f",

I recently delivered a healthy baby girl under her supervision. As first-time parents, we had endless lists of questions at every visit and every single time she would take the time to answer each question with great patience and a smile. She always patiently listened to what I had to say and would always come back with good advice and suggestions. She encouraged me from the very beginning that she will ensure I have a normal delivery. She gave proper advice regarding medication and exercise and all thanks to her I am now a proud mumma of a healthy baby. The way she handled me in the labor ward will be cherished forever. I owe a big thanks to you, mam. \nI will definitely recommend Dr. Aparna to my friends and relatives. Pregnancy is a tough journey and a good gynecologist eases the pre-delivery period with kind words and good medications.",

But Aparna ma'am really managed my case like a miracle. By god's grace I am blessed with a baby boy and delivered by aparna ma'am. We feel like she came to our life as a form of God. she is an angel for us . Her words, her way of talking, suggestion, advice everything helped me. She has also shared her WhatsApp number for emergency.i am really thankful for everything she has done for us. In the last days of delivery she was going for vacation and told me she will come after 4 days. But on the same day she checked my length and luckily cervix was opened by 4 cm. And we are blessed with a baby normal delivery. All my gratitude and thanks to aparna ma'am.",

She not only carefully listens to the queries but also takes special attention to the details. Even during emergency she had been available and did guide us to what requires to be done. We were blessed to be under her guidance when some reports were of concern. Her transparent communication and the way of treatment and most importantly remembering all her patients by name and face is just icing on the cake. With complications during NT scan/dual  marker test reports and again during the third trimester when I was diagnosed with ICP, she has all throughout been very encouraging and during the normal delivery in the eighth month due to water breakage, she is nothing but the of God to us. Thank u Doctor for all the care and support during the best phase of our life. You are the brightest star in our life and because of you we have our little sunshine with us. ",

She was very clear on how she wanted the analysis and treatment to go. She did my HSG test and fortunately it cleared some blockage in my tubes and i conceived in the 3rd month of meeting her.Then we encountered the biggest challenge. by end of 4th month of pregnancy,i started to have weird pains in uterus and Aparna mam quickly asked me to get cervical length checked. my cervix was almost open and very short. Mam asked to me get admitted the same day and she did her best to give me an emergency cervical cerclage, which was very tough as my cervix was already open. After that I was advised to be on complete bed rest and i was on bed rest for the next 4 months while getting up ONLY for using washroom. it was one of the most difficult things I have done. but thanks to Mam that she kept me motivated and guided me in every small issue via watsapp. Keeping all the patience for these months , finally we welcomed our baby boy in my 35th week via C section under strict guidance of Mam.Many many thanks to her for everything and i would recommend her to anyone who is facing high risk pregnancy.",

I was totally disappointed and tensed but after consulting with Dr. Aparna Jha suggested by  Nidhi my faith and believe gets stronger and I didn't feel like I'm consulting from her first time. She is well experienced, polite, helpful, expressive and talented in her profession due to which I have delivered normally and enjoying my parenting of a baby girl.\n\nLast but not the least I am very much thankful to nurses and caretakers like Pavitra, Angel and Chetna for giving me the best support in all circumstances with politeness and humbleness. Always be available for any support. Requesting all to please keep smiling and have the same spirit.\nThanks Apollo Cradle for having such Doctors, nurses and care takers.",

She was very friendly and approachable, all the scans consultations went smoothly.the whole process of pregnancy, tests where done in a systematic manner. \nI was not so sure on normal vaginal delivery as i am not so confident on enduring pains, but doctor was very patient in handling me during my labour. I had given a tough time to nurses and duty doctor in my labour pains but all of them were really patient and helped me ease the pain. I was not able to resist the pains so i asked doctor for a c section, but she right away denied it and asked me to resist for few more hours which was really tough and i kept on asking for operating. Doctor didnt agree for that and convinced me to resist for few more hours and finally i gave vaginal birth.Now i am heathy and completely healed within 20days of my delivery.\nAll thanks to Dr. Aparna Jha for her treatment, patience and the whole Apollo staff for all the services.\nI would recommend Dr. Aparna Jha for all the gynecological problems and all the pregnant women.",

She is the one who made it possible.Every women's dream is to experience a normal delivery and my dream came true by her hands.we have been consulting her from the beginning of my second pregnancy.she has been always supportive, approachable and very confident of her treatment.Many doctors wont suggest for Normal Delivery after a C Section and that too doctors who are busy like her would mostly opt for C Section as its safe and less risk especially during this Pandemic.But she had the patience to wait and see whether I am eligible for a VBAC and she herself suggested to give a trial for VBAC since my Babys position,gap between pregnancy and other things are favourable for Normal Delivery.I would definitely recommend her for any pregnant women especially the ones who wants to try VBAC,which neeeds highly competent doctor to mitigate the risk for both the mom and baby.Her confidence and experience will make you feel Good. We trusted her words from the beginning and went with her advice throughout our pregnancy journey.I am very grateful to her for this experience of vaginal birth.\n\nA Big Thanks to her and my other supporting team Dr.Apsa and Sister Chetna at Apollo Cradle Brookfield (both gave us support during the VBAC). Team was great and we are very happy with the experience. ",

The confidence and the trust she had created throughout the pregnancy  cannot be expressed in words .Thank you Dr for all your support.Trust your Dr and your body.",

Though I had to go through c-section delivery because dilation didnt happen, but she tried for 26 hours for a normal delivery by inducing pain through different mechanisms and kept checking the fetal heart every single minute. I am happy with the delivery process and would recommend anyone for the normal or complicated delivery cases. ",

She, however, is among those who always gives it her all. She provided us with the utmost care and emotional support, the two of which we greatly needed. In December 2023, our baby boy was finally born. Her patients are her top priority at all times. Should you be searching for the best physician, I wholeheartedly endorse her. We are so appreciative that we were able to get treated from her during my whole pregnancy.",

She's simply great at her work, making my pregnancy journey just a piece of cake, with no restrictions, and giving me the freedom of having anything but in just the right portion(considering the cravings every pregnant  women has). Her short prep talk right before the delivery gave me so much confidence that even after making a firm decision of not to go for a normal delivery(because of the 15 hours of labor) I finally had a normal delivery, which I couldn't  even dream of having after the pain. The best part is she patiently answers all your queries, and explains each and every bits and pieces of the complete  process, the only thing is you need to have some keywords, and just ask her...she's always there for you. Thanks alot mam, for making this journey a beautiful  one.",

We wanted to go for normal delivery where Dr Aparna Jha supported and guided us appropriately prior and post delivery period. Happy to have consulted and guided by Dr Aparna Jha!! ",

We visited Dr. Aparna Jha for our first consultation post pregnancy and continued with her till the successful delivery of our baby boy. She supported us very well throughout the pregnancy and instilled confidence in us whenever we were in any doubt. She wanted my wife to go for a normal vaginal delivery, but my wife was more inclined to go for a C-section delivery, she did not force her for a normal delivery but was accomodative of my wife's wishes. The C-section delivery was very smooth and very well timed, my wife was lactating immidiately after the delivery. Baby was healthy and my wife also has recovered very fast. Very happy with our decision to go with Dr. Aparna Jha. The nursing staff at the hospital were also very helpful and co-operative. Would definitely recommend Dr. Aparna and Apollo Cradle Brookfield to all couples planning their baby delivery :-)",

Her prime agenda is welfare of the patients and ease for their attendants. She treated my wife with care and professionalism.\n\nShe was available at every step of the way, right from the 1st month to the eventual surgery and the follow-up, patiently elaborating the procedures all the while. Her polite demeanour and willingness to help, coupled with a helpful staff, played a big role in easing out the concerns that I or my family might've had. Thoroughly satisfied with the whole delivery process.\n\n\nI totally recommend her to everyone. Thank you Mam for being there in this amazing phase of life and giving us our bundle of joy.",

After discussing with Aparna ma'am duty doctor started the procedure. Afternoon ma'am came and did the examination. I was 3 cm dilated and ma'am told no need of further induction. In few hours your delivery will be done and it happened exactly at the time she mentioned. During labour I was going through lot of pain and it was unbearable. Whole Apollo staff and Dr. Aparna were very supportive. They were always motivating. A Big thanks to everyone. Thank you Aparna ma'am for everything.",

With her immense knowledge and experience, she made our journey of becoming parents with normal delivery so smooth that we recommended her to 4 more friends of ours and they are also very happy with her treatment and guidance. If there are no complications doctor makes sure that it is 100% normal delivery.\nWe feel proud to have become parents of a baby girl on 19th Nov under the care and guidance of Dr Aparna Jha. \nThank you very much, ma'am.\nRajashree & Vinay",

We had been trying for a baby since 2012 (soon after we got married). Unfortunately, we did not see any success until 2021 only after meeting doctor Basavaraj from Vishvas fertility Center. We went for IVF and after the first two unsuccessful attempts, my wife finally conceived in the 3rd attempt. Then we were referred to doctor Aparna Jha for the further check ups and delivery. With so many complications with pregnancy, we had no hope for a normal delivery but, Dr Aparna Jha made it possible and my wife delivered our cute little princess on 7th of August through a normal vaginal delivery.",

From day 1,she put us at ease and we were very comfortable throughout the 9 months. There were no complications whatsoever. Though we were planning for normal delivery and Doc was guiding us for that, at the end we opted for cesarian delivery which was also quite smooth. A healthy baby was born. After surgery, Doc encouraged to be active so as to aid quicker recovery and indeed the recovery has been very very satisfactory in past 10-12 days. We recommend visiting her for pregnancy related matters. ",

She is such a friendly person and makes you feel most comfortable. You can ask whatever questions you have in mind and she answers them patiently . No matter what she explains the pros and cons of each procedure. \nMine was 4th pregnancy and earlier three were miscarriages. I was on daily heparin dose. We never thought we could have a normal delivery. But it was only Dr Aparna who had the confidence and kept motivating us for normal delivery. And yes I delivered my baby normally. \nAfter my delivery when I was going through postpartum blues it were her words which helped me. We can't thank her enough for giving us our bundle of joy. \nAlso I have had a very happy and pleasant experience with Apollo cradle staff and facilities. I genuinely recommend the hospital and Dr Aparna.",

She did not share any unnecessary test and medicine. She was stick to the plan and we just followed her blindly. Through out our journey we never fear or feel alone as she was there with us. And as a result we got our baby boy with Normal delivery. I will recommend everyone to visit Dr Aparna Jha for gynaecology and obstetrics. Trust me you will not regret by choosing her.Thank you Aprna Ma'am for all your support.Thank youGeetija",

I could have avoided second laparoscopy if I have received proper directions from her.  She also doesn't respond  to any personal messages. \nI have visted her at Apollo, Brookfield. This site doe snot have any emergency measures.

While most of the doctors wouldn't even try and straight away opt for C-section for convenience, Dr Aparna waited till 39 weeks  and let the natural process kick in. I am really greatful to her for trying VBAC and help me deliver without epidural. I would highly recommend Dr Aparna for pregnancy and gynecologist consultation.",

Not only this during delivery time she was present over there personally even though it was early in the morning. Everything went well. We want to say thanks to Dr Aparna & entire Apollo Cradle family for their utmost services & cooperative nature. We wish them good luck in their careers. \n\n5/5 from our side. \nA+ rating ",

She made our journey of pregnancy very smooth.The way she handles the case and explains the details to her patients is remarkable. In these 8 months i never got a thought to take a second opinion from any other gynec. I had never thought i would deliver normally but it was her faith and believe in me that lead to me delivering normally .in this whole journey she always suggested to take one day at a time and as and when time comes she would guide through the right path.I would say she is a normal delivery specialist unless and until the patient has any complications. In these months of association with her she never uttered a single word about C section and always insisted on normal delivery though i was mentally prepared of any mode of delivery.The comfort she provides is beyond explanation.A big thank you to Dr Aparna without whom i would not have had a hassle free pregnancy to delivery journey ",
