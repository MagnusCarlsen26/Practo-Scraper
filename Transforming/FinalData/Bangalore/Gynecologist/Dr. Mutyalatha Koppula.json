So I visited the clinic regarding this.. at the same time I was suffering from vagina itching. she was so patient, listened to my problems and just\u00a0 prescribed me a wash for vaginal infection. Unlike my previous doctors who gave high dosage tablets which are of no use. then she asked me to visit after a week regarding my pregnancy issue. and gave me some tablets which helped in increasing my egg counts. I followed all her instructions and in just 2 months I skipped my periods and tested positive. she took care of me so very well throughout my pregnancy and delivered my baby. on the delivery day also she was very supportive she built my confidence level. I was so panic but she managed everything perfectly with a smiling face. I can say just like a family member. now me and my baby are doing well. A very special thanks to Dr. Mutyalatha. Thank you so much mam for your kindness and support.",

So I visited the clinic regarding this.. at the same time I was suffering from vagina itching. she was so patient, listened to my problems and just\u00a0 prescribed me a wash for vaginal infection. Unlike my previous doctors who gave high dosage tablets which are of no use. then she asked me to visit after a week regarding my pregnancy issue. and gave me some tablets which helped in increasing my egg counts. I followed all her instructions and in just 2 months I skipped my periods and tested positive. she took care of me so very well throughout my pregnancy and delivered my baby. on the delivery day also she was very supportive she built my confidence level. I was so panic but she managed everything perfectly with a smiling face. I can say just like a family member. now me and my baby are doing well. A very special thanks to Dr. Mutyalatha. Thank you so much mam for your kindness and support.",
