We are so glad and thankful to these reviews for guiding us to her and more than grateful to her for making this journey absolutely memorable. \n\nThe Long Review:\n\nHere are just a few anecdotes from our pregnancy and birthing experience with Dr. Triveni: \n\nFriendly & Approachable: During the 9 months+ of our interaction, we developed a great rapport with her. My wife came to believe in her experience and expertise completely. We were ready to follow her suggestion every step of the way. During labor, there are 100s of things that can go haywire, and having her helped us choose our options wisely. \n \nGives You Time: During our interactions she patiently took the time to answer each of our questions. (Being first time parents, we did have a lot of questions). Few of our consults took 30+ mins (esp. towards the end of our journey), and she never ended any of these meetings in haste. Whenever we felt that things were getting out of control, she was just a WhatsApp message away. This felt quite reassuring. \n\nScientific & Experience-based Advice: Her recommendations on delivery procedures (ex: episiotomy during a normal delivery) and pregnancy practices (ex: supplementation/exercises) are based on scientific trials that are done with Indian women and her past experience. She helped us understand the reasoning behind every single call / suggestion of hers\n\nTailored Approach - Dr.Triveni is quite perceptive and experienced - she tailored her approach based on things beyond the hospital room too - for example - stuff like my wife's daily physical activity, prior scan and test reports etc.,\n\nGives you Confidence - At one point when we had almost decided to go the C-route, our doctor's call and faith in my wife helped us to stay the course and finally she had a normal delivery. Having experienced the attitude of other duty doctors first hand, we can't emphasize how important this is. It makes all the difference. \n\nApart from our gynaec, we would also like to thank her team of support doctors and experienced nurses (esp. Aniyamma) at Cloudnine who provided us the best care and support before, during and after the birth of our baby. \n\nFor such an important journey in life, we strongly recommend Dr.Triveni and the Cloudnine Team (for their experience and processes). **** *** ****** ***** *** **** ** ********** \n",

Cloudnine SahakarNagar was closest to our house and we booked online to visit. Fortunately we booked Triveni Ma'am. We had no prior knowledge or recommendation for her so we were no sure what to expect. But after that first consultation till today (July 2022) she has been truly exceptional. We were a demanding client as we are based abroad and only wanted to come to India for 1st trimester and then delivary, she helped us on what's app, answered our calls and was truly present throughout the pregnancy journey. We were blessed with a baby boy on 22/June/2022 and the delivery experience with Triveni Ma'am was also great. Her greatest strength I feel is her poise and relaxed nature and her toolkit is full of knowledge, patience and maturity.\n\nThank you again Triveni Ma'am for all your help in bringing our beautiful baby boy into this world. \n\nWe recommend her whole heartedly.\n\nTej and Rahul\n**********************",

We are so glad and thankful to these reviews for guiding us to her and more than grateful to her for making this journey absolutely memorable. \n\nThe Long Review:\n\nHere are just a few anecdotes from our pregnancy and birthing experience with Dr. Triveni: \n\nFriendly & Approachable: During the 9 months+ of our interaction, we developed a great rapport with her. My wife came to believe in her experience and expertise completely. We were ready to follow her suggestion every step of the way. During labor, there are 100s of things that can go haywire, and having her helped us choose our options wisely. \n \nGives You Time: During our interactions she patiently took the time to answer each of our questions. (Being first time parents, we did have a lot of questions). Few of our consults took 30+ mins (esp. towards the end of our journey), and she never ended any of these meetings in haste. Whenever we felt that things were getting out of control, she was just a WhatsApp message away. This felt quite reassuring. \n\nScientific & Experience-based Advice: Her recommendations on delivery procedures (ex: episiotomy during a normal delivery) and pregnancy practices (ex: supplementation/exercises) are based on scientific trials that are done with Indian women and her past experience. She helped us understand the reasoning behind every single call / suggestion of hers\n\nTailored Approach - Dr.Triveni is quite perceptive and experienced - she tailored her approach based on things beyond the hospital room too - for example - stuff like my wife's daily physical activity, prior scan and test reports etc.,\n\nGives you Confidence - At one point when we had almost decided to go the C-route, our doctor's call and faith in my wife helped us to stay the course and finally she had a normal delivery. Having experienced the attitude of other duty doctors first hand, we can't emphasize how important this is. It makes all the difference. \n\nApart from our gynaec, we would also like to thank her team of support doctors and experienced nurses (esp. Aniyamma) at Cloudnine who provided us the best care and support before, during and after the birth of our baby. \n\nFor such an important journey in life, we strongly recommend Dr.Triveni and the Cloudnine Team (for their experience and processes). **** *** ****** ***** *** **** ** ********** \n",

Cloudnine SahakarNagar was closest to our house and we booked online to visit. Fortunately we booked Triveni Ma'am. We had no prior knowledge or recommendation for her so we were no sure what to expect. But after that first consultation till today (July 2022) she has been truly exceptional. We were a demanding client as we are based abroad and only wanted to come to India for 1st trimester and then delivary, she helped us on what's app, answered our calls and was truly present throughout the pregnancy journey. We were blessed with a baby boy on 22/June/2022 and the delivery experience with Triveni Ma'am was also great. Her greatest strength I feel is her poise and relaxed nature and her toolkit is full of knowledge, patience and maturity.\n\nThank you again Triveni Ma'am for all your help in bringing our beautiful baby boy into this world. \n\nWe recommend her whole heartedly.\n\nTej and Rahul\n**********************",

She has been there with us throughout the 9-months journey, answers every little question, avoids medication & unnatural methods unless absolutely necessary, and most importantly, is a doctor you can trust. We pray she is rewarded abundantly for her good deeds, may she always keep smiling and continue to bring joy to many more families.",

Through the course of my pregnancy, Dr.Triveni was available via chat and also saw every one of my scan report (20 scans in total). She advised on the right additional medications to take to prolong my pregnancy to 36 weeks. I delivered healthy twin boys via a scheduled c section. I would 100% recommend Dr.Triveni. she is thorough and positive in her approach. She is proactive and gives the best medical support.",

We met her right after finding about pregnancy and since then she has been our guiding star. Why we chose her as our doc was very simple - We felt friendly, at ease, clear and straight communication, always there for us replying to our silly queries even at 2 am. Always felt like we were talking and discussing with a family member. We were referred Couldnine by our close friends with few doctors name, but after meeting her we didn't feel like going anywhere else, as in our first consultantion itself, we felt the confidence and positivity and immediately had that doc patient bond. We would like to thank her from the bottom of our heart. We highly recommend her to all of you reading this and also to our friends family and neighbours.
