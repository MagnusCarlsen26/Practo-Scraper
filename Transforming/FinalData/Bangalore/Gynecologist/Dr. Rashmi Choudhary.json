My and my husband are lone couple working in Bangalore with whole family at Patna. She was the one who gave confidence and we decided not to go back. She had been an Angel and everything was so easy.  Thanks to her we are proud parents of a wonderful daughter. She took extra care of me and guided everything and also  was able to find reason behind miscarriage and she treated me accordingly.**** ************* * **** ****She is well experienced and knows all kind of complications one can face.May God add many more years to your service as we are forever thankful to you mam \ud83d\udc9e",

I know it sounds exaggerated, but she's the God sent angel who gifted me the joy of becoming a mother.this was my second pregnancy. my first pregnancy was in the same hospital, with another doctor but sadly I delivered prematurely first time, and my baby couldn't survive. if only I went to Dr. Rashmi first time also. I was reluctant in writing review because, honestly in my office if any colleague has troubled pregnancy case, you hear her name that go to her, she'll save. she's that good. I met five esteemed doctors before going for Dr Rashmi in my second pregnancy. in addition to giving a level of comfort, we found thoughtfulness and expertise also in her.  it is such a long and important journey that one needs to be connected with the obgyn. she was there throughout, all the time, available. I had this sense of security being around her. I was so scared all the time due to prior loss, but she'd listen to me, weigh out the pros and cons, and make me comfortable. she'd never just shoo off any of my concern. that shows the level of seniority and humbleness she has. I used to go so many times, and she was never irritated with my endless list of queries. I have never seen her fussy, so calm and composed. I was lucky enough to have her as my doctor, I had a normal delivery and I am a mother of a four months old baby girl, all credit to Dr Rashmi really. thanks from the bottom of my heart for being there ma'am, you truly are a gem and a blessing for people like me.",

The prenatal and post delivery care was handled by Dr Rashmi at Cloudnine in Bellandur.  I had a normal delivery and she waits for things to take it's course of time normally instead of hurriedly deciding for c section or induced labor or suggesting epidural. She gave good encouragement during delivery to push the baby. she treated me as her own daughter in the labor ward,  Post delivery care was also very good.\nLike any other elated new to-be parents we had tons of questions and concerns. Dr Rashmi helped us overcome all our fears and handled us extremely sensitively.\nI am extremely satisfied and happy with that I consulted Dr., Rashmi for my first pregnancy. She is an expert and carries a rich experience in her field.\nDr. Rashmi has answered all our queries with lot of patience and was always reachable on phone and watsapp at anytime. She is very gentle in her procedures and has an expert hand. Dr. Rashmi was easily able to make out the problems just by looking at the symptoms. \nWe decided to continue with CloudNine for the entire period only because of Dr. Rashmi Choudhary.. Thanks a lot Doctor. I am running out of words and cant thank you enough.. All the best",

First of all, she doesnt maintain punctuality and comes late to the hospital. we had to wait almost 45 mins from the time of appointment. During our first consultation, she was fine with us and wrote some of the diagnostic tests. We met her again for the second time with all our reports. During our second visit, she was behaving very awkward with us and was very rude. She was very impatient in answering our questions and was taking no interest in explaining things. She was warning us not to ask silly questions and said not to discuss insignificant things. As a medical doctor, she may find certain things to be silly but as a patient it is normal for my friend to ask her doubts on the treatment options. Because of doctor's unprofessional behavior, we got nervous and uncomfortable. She may have 100 issues outside her clinic, she is not supposed to show that on her patients. It is unethical and unfair to do that. Had she been a little polite in answering our doubts, my friend would have felt a lot better and confident.  We couldn't ask any more questions due to her unprofessional attitude, we had to walk out of her cabin. We had paid 4000/- for the consultation and diagnostics. As a patient, my friend had every right to know about her health issues, complications and treatment options.  Doctor is not at all patient friendly. We had to change the place of treatment after this bad experience. \r\n",

I know it sounds exaggerated, but she's the God sent angel who gifted me the joy of becoming a mother.this was my second pregnancy. my first pregnancy was in the same hospital, with another doctor but sadly I delivered prematurely first time, and my baby couldn't survive. if only I went to Dr. Rashmi first time also. I was reluctant in writing review because, honestly in my office if any colleague has troubled pregnancy case, you hear her name that go to her, she'll save. she's that good. I met five esteemed doctors before going for Dr Rashmi in my second pregnancy. in addition to giving a level of comfort, we found thoughtfulness and expertise also in her.  it is such a long and important journey that one needs to be connected with the obgyn. she was there throughout, all the time, available. I had this sense of security being around her. I was so scared all the time due to prior loss, but she'd listen to me, weigh out the pros and cons, and make me comfortable. she'd never just shoo off any of my concern. that shows the level of seniority and humbleness she has. I used to go so many times, and she was never irritated with my endless list of queries. I have never seen her fussy, so calm and composed. I was lucky enough to have her as my doctor, I had a normal delivery and I am a mother of a four months old baby girl, all credit to Dr Rashmi really. thanks from the bottom of my heart for being there ma'am, you truly are a gem and a blessing for people like me.",

The prenatal and post delivery care was handled by Dr Rashmi at Cloudnine in Bellandur.  I had a normal delivery and she waits for things to take it's course of time normally instead of hurriedly deciding for c section or induced labor or suggesting epidural. She gave good encouragement during delivery to push the baby. she treated me as her own daughter in the labor ward,  Post delivery care was also very good.\nLike any other elated new to-be parents we had tons of questions and concerns. Dr Rashmi helped us overcome all our fears and handled us extremely sensitively.\nI am extremely satisfied and happy with that I consulted Dr., Rashmi for my first pregnancy. She is an expert and carries a rich experience in her field.\nDr. Rashmi has answered all our queries with lot of patience and was always reachable on phone and watsapp at anytime. She is very gentle in her procedures and has an expert hand. Dr. Rashmi was easily able to make out the problems just by looking at the symptoms. \nWe decided to continue with CloudNine for the entire period only because of Dr. Rashmi Choudhary.. Thanks a lot Doctor. I am running out of words and cant thank you enough.. All the best",

First of all, she doesnt maintain punctuality and comes late to the hospital. we had to wait almost 45 mins from the time of appointment. During our first consultation, she was fine with us and wrote some of the diagnostic tests. We met her again for the second time with all our reports. During our second visit, she was behaving very awkward with us and was very rude. She was very impatient in answering our questions and was taking no interest in explaining things. She was warning us not to ask silly questions and said not to discuss insignificant things. As a medical doctor, she may find certain things to be silly but as a patient it is normal for my friend to ask her doubts on the treatment options. Because of doctor's unprofessional behavior, we got nervous and uncomfortable. She may have 100 issues outside her clinic, she is not supposed to show that on her patients. It is unethical and unfair to do that. Had she been a little polite in answering our doubts, my friend would have felt a lot better and confident.  We couldn't ask any more questions due to her unprofessional attitude, we had to walk out of her cabin. We had paid 4000/- for the consultation and diagnostics. As a patient, my friend had every right to know about her health issues, complications and treatment options.  Doctor is not at all patient friendly. We had to change the place of treatment after this bad experience. \r\n",

I was having a low lying placenta also short cervix issue. Dr. Rashmi made sure everything goes fine and suggested me the best. She was always available over WhatsApp and also over call in case of emergency. I had bleeding episodes twice in my pregnancy period and that too early in the morning but when I called ma'am she picked up the call and guided me what to do even though it was a Sunday. She was supportive, friendly and always suggested me the best. With God's grace I gave birth. She also played a major role in making this possible. Throughout my journey Dr. Rashmi was there with me supporting like a mother.  Me and my entire family wants to thank her from bottom of our heart for giving us our bundle of joy. She is truly a gem of a person. ",

She has always listened to me patiently, prescribed only necessary tests/scans and addressed all my concerns during every visit. She also understood my feelings as I was very anxious due to several complications and she always has a kind reassuring word. She was always approachable and responded to  messages, kick counts in whatsApp at all times of the day and night even during her vacation.  She is a brilliant medical practitioner and my whole family is grateful and thankful to her for bringing my baby to full term and delivering my princess safely despite several complications throughout nine months. Her motherly care and expertise helped me cross this high risk pregnancy journey successfully.  Will highly recommend her to everyone for a smooth and happy pregnancy. ",

She doesn't prescribe any unnecessary tests or medications. She made me feel very comfortable throughout pregnancy and treated me like her daughter.On the day of delivery she was on call with the junior doctors and reached the hospital at 4 a.m (within 20mins)She is someone who advocates normal delivery. I had a very short labor and smooth delivery under her.During our stay she ensured proper care ,post delivery consultations were also satisfactory.She isnt just a doctor she is an angel for us ! The entire staff(nursing,housekeeping,pantry) everyone is extremely cooperative and ensures safety of the mother and baby.The only thing which we feel isn't fair was the  consultation charges for the first post delivery checkup for the mother.",

Doctor with her finesse hands, with right set of medications, right sets of scans, tests etc helped us complete 39 weeks of pregnancy. We never found her suggesting unnecessary tests, scans even in such stressful conditions. Finally we delivered our baby dauther, our bundle of joy, through C-section (induction for normal delivery didn't work); Although slightly underweight, but perfectly healthy. She has been doing perfectly well ever since her birth. Her growth has been good. thank you Ma'am. You are awesome.regards,Nikita & Ashutosh",

Once hospital authority informed her, she started guiding sister's and other gynaecologist about the medications I should be given. She was checking my conditions over call, once in 30 mins to 1 hour. She also came to the hospital on Sunday afternoon, just to see how I am doing. Since water broke was not heavy during morning, doctors waited and induced pain by 2:30am. Sister sand other gynaecologist(who was on duty) were keep on checking my condition and were waiting for the pain.\nFinally I delivered the baby at 4:21 am through normal delivery.\nDoctor Rashmi came around 4:00am and started delivery procedure around 4:10am.\nI did not even feel the labour pain for long.\nTo the best of my knowledge which is based on the stories I heard from friends & family members, I was lucky enough to get the best treatment during and post pregnancy.

I trusted on her medication and did all the tests/scan she prescribed. \nAfter 7month I conceived naturally. She suggested only required medicines and scan, nothing unnecessary.\n\nI never felt that I am going to meet a doctor. She always treated me like her own daughter and I also have a motherly feeling with her. She always responded over call/what's app.\nAt the time of labor pain, she came early morning for delivery and motivated me to push baby as I was all over exhausted due to pain. And finally blessed with a healthy baby girl through normal delivery.\n\nIt is just a few words of what ever I experienced with her. I am 100% satisfied with doctor's ********** professionalism, behaviour, positive attitude and friendly nature. I will recommend all my friends and family members whoever is having any pregnancy issues or need consultation over pregnancy period.\n\nThankyou so much Rashmi mam,I can't express my feelings through words.

She was able to quickly identify issues with cervical length and contractions even before external symptoms were visible. \n\nDuring the fifth month of our pregnancy, it was only due to the doctor's intuition that we performed a cervical scan and identified that the cervical length was extremely low and a stitch was needed.\n\nAgain at around 32 weeks, it was again the doctor's intuition that found us doing another scan where we found that her canal was starting to open and bed rest was needed.\n\nIn both cases, my wife had experienced no physical discomfort nor any external symptoms that rang any alarms. \n\nThe doctor was able to identify all these issues with her experience beforehand and was able to perform remedial actions. Thanks to her my wife gave birth at 37 weeks without any issues.\n\nIf ever we decide to have another child, we would prefer no other doctor but Dr Rashmi Choudhary and I recommend her to all my friends.",

And the wait time was often around 10-15 mins.\nI was inclined towards a vaginal delivery and Dr. Rashmi motivated me throughout the last 3 months and guided me well. She would respond to my important messages during odd hours as well.\nAt the delivery day, she attended me well on time. Though i had developed a complications during delivery, she asked us if we would go for a C-section while suggesting confidently that a normal delivery was very much possible. We trusted her and proceeded with normal delivery during which she was caring as well as on her feet to facilitate a safe and memorable experience.\nShe collected the stem cells for my baby. The delivery was the least painful possible (personal opinion) and post delivery recovery happened quite comfortably, Thanks to Dr. Rashmi for staying with us during the whole thing. Definitely going back to her for my next pregnancy when we plan one.",

When I was pregnant third time, my friend suggested me to consult Dr. Rashmi. Doctor heard me thoroughly and understood every minor detail, she gave me the confidence and support. After talking to her, I felt that now I am in safe hands. She was always approachable even when she is on leave and took care of me throughout the pregnancy with great care and confidence. Now I am a mother of a cute baby girl and very thankful to Dr. Rashmi for all the care, support, guidance, treatment she provided.\n\nDr. Rashmi is a gem and highly recommended. You don't need to worry at all if you are being treated by her. God bless her for all the kind/great work she is doing.",

Dr Rashmi helped us overcome all our fears and handled us extremely sensitively. \n\nDr Rashmi hand held us during each stage of the pregnancy. Her guidance was to the point and she proactively resolved any issue if at all it would crop up. Geetanjali is 35 years old and we had a normal delivery. If not for Dr Rashmi's confidence and deep expertise we would not have had to confidence for a normal delivery. \n\nDr Rashmi's conservative approach without rushing to make decisions helped us have a full term baby. Doctor interpreted all scans and tests in a excellent gave and this gave us confidence of her technical expertise each time we visited her. She was promptly available any time of the day full week to help and guide us. Our experience with Doctor Rashmi has been so pleasant that we are at loss of words at times. \n\nPlease reach out to us if you would like to know more about our experience.",

She is an expert and carries a rich experience in her field.\nDr. Rashmi has answered all our queries with lot of patience and was always reachable on phone and watsapp. She is very gentle in her procedures and has an expert hand. Dr. Rashmi was easily able to make out the problems just by looking at the symptoms. I gained some extra pounds in between visits and Dr. immediately asked me to get my Diabetes tested, similarly she noticed my mood swings post delivery and asked me to get Thyroid tested. \nShe will not let you worry for petty issues during pregnancy. She will always try for a normal delivery unless there are some serious problems.\nDr. Rashmi is a warm and gentle person & exhibits motherly touch. \nI can vouch for Dr. Rashmi.\n\nOn a side note: Just a tip from my personal experience,  Practicing deep Breathing during pregnancy and when in labor pain helped me a lot during my delivery. Hope that helps!",

She is a very kind and professional doctor, answers all our queries and made the pregnancy experience very smooth. I had a normal delivery and she waits for things to take it's course of time normally instead of hurriedly deciding for c section or induced labour or suggesting epidural. She gave good encouragement during delivery to push the baby. Post delivery care was also very good. I consulted Dr. Rashmi for my 2nd kid and definitely the 2nd baby delivery experience is way too better than the first baby delivery experience at my native. The lactation consultant at cloud nine Bellandur also needs a round of applause, she is also a very calm lady and explained the importance of breastfeeding. She improved the baby's latch thereby making breastfeeding a happy journey. The nurses and staff at Cloudnine were happy to help all the time. Overall I had no negative experience post delivery and all the moments during delivery and initial breastfeeding will be a memory to cherish on every birthday of my kid. I would definitely recommend Dr. Rashmi Choudhary and Cloudnine hospital at Bellandur to all my friends in Bangalore.. ",

At the first meeting, I felt so connected as she was very motherly. Within 2 months of her advice, I conceived naturally. She gave me thyroid tabloid as this was at the higher end for pregnancy and folic acid as well. After I conceived, she didn't give me any unnecessary medicine and with every scan, if some numbers go up in reports, she always said positively that all is well and gave me proper medication to recover. Throughout my pregnancy, there wasn't a single time when she didn't motivate me for normal delivery. Although sometimes I use to be very negative she was sure that I will be going through normal delivery and I should make my mind for that only. For your concerns, she will calmly listen to your problems and if there is an emergency, she will even be available on her phone. Finally, after completing 9 months, I went into labour for 13hrs and had a normal delivery. When I was going through pains, she was there and motivated me that I can do it and never I felt that I should give up and go for an operation. Make sure you listen to her so that they can follow their procedures and help us only. After delivery also, she gave me the same vitamins to go through for 2 months. My overall experience with her is very good and will suggest her name to all my friends who are planning and will plan for a baby. I am very thankful to her that everything went well at the end and I delivered a healthy baby girl.",

It was before 2years when v thought of having a family and started consulting another private hospital.. we continued at the other hospital for a year with no results.. so did some research to find out a good doctor who can help us better.. after lot of google research we decided to consult Dr. Rashmi Choudhary.. The first appointment was very positive and doctor told us she will do some tests, prescribe medicines and then v can see the results in 6months.. This actually came true and I was pregnant in just 3 months time.. Dr. Rashmi Choudhary is so polite, humble and calm and I have never seen a Doctor like her.. She has answered all our questions patiently and literally empathized each patient and takes proper time during consultation.. she treats her patients as family and have never seen her loosing it or being rude ever..\nToday we are proud parents of twins one boy and one girl and I do not have words to express my gratitude to the Dr. Thanks a lot Doctor for helping us at every stage of pregnancy.. right from planning to the delivery.. you have just been amazing and I strongly recommend you ** *** *** *** **** ** **** ***** ** ***** Thanks again.\nLastly. The only reason why Cloud Nine hospital in Belandur is well known is because of good Doctors it has and the way Doctors carry out their duty towards the patients is just amazing.. We decided to continue with CloundNine for the entire period only because of Dr. Rashmi Choudhry.. Thanks a lot Doctor. I am running out of words and cant thank you enough.. All the best",

She listened to my problems calmly and explained reasons for them and solutions every single time.  I was high blood pressure patient, I had complications in my journey. Ma'am gave me her number that I can call her any time and she helped me every time immediately. Rashmi ma'am is very friendly with her patients. I had an emergency c- section delivery and she was so caring during the whole procedure. I would like to thank Rashmi ma'am with my deepest heart for making my pregnancy fearless. I will highly recommend Rashmi ma'am. I gave Rashmi ma'am's recommendation in my society also.  Thank you ma'am for your support. ",

It was one of the best decisions to go with her. Although I had complications, she never scared me. She is always so understanding and takes care of the fears especially for a first time mother. She will explain the details required for the patient and prescribe the best she can do.\nDue to my complications she advised rest in the 3rd trimester and that C sec would be best. We went with her suggestion and we were blessed with our baby all healthy. I would highly recommend her as she doesn\u2019t unnecessarily scare you, she is too polite and yet firm to deal with pregnant ladies. I had a very seem less journey with her throughout my pregnancy and post pregnancy especially in pandemic era it was blissful.  I might be very late in writing this review but better late than never.",

Doctor made me comfortable during pregnancy visits, helped with online video consultation while I got covid during 2nd trimesters and with normal delivery having her team of nurses and junior doctor telling I am her old patient :). Although I wished for normal delivery, I never insisted/enforced on her like must have. Doctor wanted me to have normal and  said she wants me to have same and will try the same asking me to keep open mind as at delivery time any complications could occur. She is very responsive on whatsapp to help with my queries and review reports over phone. I will recommend her 100% for any pregnancy cases. Thank you again, doctor to enjoy motherhood second time!!",

She will guide and inform you when you have to worry and when not to. As an expecting parent you will read and come up will all theories from websites. But, soon you will realize there is a huge difference between theory and experience. When things were really need she guides us. e.g., during the last days of pregnancy my wife's fluid level was very well monitored by doctor *** *** **** **** ** *** ** *** ***** ***** ** ****** *********** So, please don't make any pre-judgement of her. Also, she was always reachable any time and guides even at late hours when we were worried. ",

Her support and friendliness are really helping to avoid panic in the patience and her support over the phone really helped a lot and many times I could avoid rushing to hospital from office. Her timely decision during delivery helped to avoid another surgery for another problem. I strongly recommend her to every one. I really thanked my friend for refereeing her to us",

She has tried to avoid C-Section till the very last minute but due to some unavoidable circumstances she has to go with C-Section.\nThe stitch was so perfect that I had never had any issues till now.\nI have no words to express my gratitude but just want to say .. Mam ..I love you very much and you are like a God to me. Keep up the good work.. Cheers \n",

Given our first baby we had lot of anxiety and questions but She explained everything very well and made entire process simple and easy for us. Our decision of going with cloudnine and especially with Dr Rashmi was correct and we thank them for a good experience. ",

I had suffered a  miscarriage in 2013 and was anxious because of previous loss, she gave me strength and ensured that I deliver successfully.Finding ma\u2019am was pure grace as I had been praying all this while for divine to choose a doctor for me. I had synchronic haemotoma, chronic hypertension, cervix shortening, due to her expertise and timely detection of problems. I have my baby  in my arms. Two of my friends are also consulting her currently and are happy. If you are lucky to be in Bangalore do visit her without a second thought..she responds quickly to queries no matter how trivial they are..if I plan another baby ever, I m definitely going to consult her.",

I sincerely believe in trusting your doctor completely and Dr Rashmi took care of my delivery and post delivery so well. I fall short of words here to express how satisfied I am with her approach and patience. I am also grateful to her for removing my fibroid during my Caesarean section.

What I like the most about her is her kind and approachable behavior, no matter how silly the doubt is, she will always explain it to you in detail. I would highly highly recommend her to anyone looking for a Gynecologist who is caring, ******* *** with Strong Work Ethics. You can even reach out to her on whatsapp and emails with your doubts. After my delivery she made sure to visit me everyday and asked me about my health. The level of comfort she provides made my pregnancy journey very smooth. Highly recommend her!",

There was a time during my wife's pregnancy when she was admitted to the hospital due to certain complications. Dr Rashminwas always there to support and showed care and concern when we were all worried.2. Practicality: In our experience with her so far, she was always looking at what was the best way  forward to handle the pregnancy and childbirth.3. Approachability: She was always there over WhatsApp or mails whenever we had doubts/ worries, which most parents have.Thanks to her practical and sensible approach, my wife had a normal delivery last week - and the baby and mother are both healthy and fine.",

First 3 months my consultation was at motherhood where I really had a bad experience. I got to know about Dr Rashmi chaudhry via Practo where I could see 99% positive comments. Based on the feedbacks wanted to visit her for my pregnancy check up. I am glad and happy that I found such a wonderful doctor.  She is very calm, friendly and explains you each and every thing in detail. I was scared all the time because of my late pregnancy but doctor ensured I don't get panic and stay positive. I am blessed with a healthy baby girl. I don't think I would have had such good experience with any other doctor. Thanks to you doctor for all the care and support rendered by you especially during the Covid situation. All nurse and hospital staff were really supportive. on the whole really had a good experience. Dr Rashmi and cloudnine rocks\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42",

She was very patient in all my consultations through out the pregnancy answering all doubts I had and providing proper treatment and medication at all times. She keeps the patient positive which helps one to be not afraid in pregnancy. Also she always gives timely treatment if she deems that there can be a complication- she suggested a planned C section for me due to few health issues - I had complete faith in her decision and she helped me deliver a healthy baby.

She even replied to my concern when she was out of India for some time.\nShe never prescribed any unnecesary tests or medicines.

Her expertise made me feel reassured, confident and taken care of.Today i am mother of 2 month's baby girl. Big Thanks to Dr. Rashmi for her kindness, speed and professionalism.

She would take time to explain it to my mom also so that she isn't anxious (as parent tend to worry aLot).The Dr was always available to answer to queries be it odd hours or her week off days. I think thats what distinguishes this profession from others and thanks to people like her who still make us believe that Doctors are next to God :). Even after getting married pregnancy had been a question for me in my mind as many people told me that my kind of PCOD might have issues. Thankfully I had been consulting Dr Rashmi, she helped prepare my body from quite an early stage and the pregnancy was quite smooth! I have and will always recommend her to all my friends and relatives. ",

Dr. Rashmi is a very friendly and empathetic doctor, she patiently listens to any issues and will advise accordingly. I wanted a normal delivery but was very apprehensive but Dr. Rashmi gave us all the confidence and encouraged to think about normal delivery and was very positive every time we visited. Throughout my pregnancy and delivery care she proactively communicated all the details and never prescribed any unnecessary medication. Under her care we now have a healthy baby and my pregnancy and delivery was a smooth experience.\n\nWe are very happy with Dr. Rashmi and experience with her and will definitely visit her for anything future.",

She tried all possible solutions to treat it and stretched it till 33weeks. Though my pregnancy was complicated bus she never made us realize that. Before c section I was so nervous and had lost my confidence to go in OT but she supported me a lot a even holded my hand and took me to OT. I really appreciate the motherly attitude of a doctor for a would be mother.She never suggested any unnecessary  medicine or test but did all required things.It's only because of her I could give birth to a healthy baby even in 33weeks.Thanks to Dr. Rashmi .

She will not prescribe unnecessary medicines or tests.\nStarted my pregnancy with low lying placenta where she advised me to take care of certain things but not panic. This got resolved by second trimester. \nWith short cervix diagnosed at 28 weeks, everything scared me apart from her assurance that we can carry full term which we did. She asked me till take test but no bed rest which helped me keep sane as well\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0a \nAs the baby was breech, we had no option other than c-section. My baby boy was delivered via emergency c-section (doctor was well on time for delivery late night) and I was all the more confident as she was there.\nBeing available even during off duty hours via messages were so comforting.

She took care of me and my medical conditions with utmost prority. She personally monitored all my pregancy scans and closely monitored my baby's development. She never hesitate to answer all my offline calls whenever I needed her .one important point it is that she is easily approachable on phone and whats app. As my due date approached I was nervous and scared she helped me to overcome my fear and promised me that she will ensure it would be a smooth delivery and the same thing was happened I had a cesarean delivery in the month September 2017.We all aware that the absolute pain would be there but here I want to highlight that the way  she operated ,even after post delivery till  the bandage got removed i observe only minor pain ,that is a big relief from her side. \\n\\nWe are very pleased to thank her for all the support and guidance. CloudNine hospital is the best hospital in bellandur for women and child care. We received utmost and prompt reeponse and services from reception and scan deaprtments.\\n\\nCloudNine is best of all .once again thank you Dr. Rashmi Choudhary for you warm care",

Dr Rashmi spends good time hearing patient doubts/problems and answers them very well which is the best assurance any patient longs for. Throughout my pregnancy she didn't recommend any unnecessary medication or test. While we thought of doing normal delivery but due to last minute complications had to undergo a emergency c section and Dr Rashmi reached the hospital in less than 20 mins in the wee hours and in other 10 mins my surgery was done. Very thankful to the Doctor for taking such prompt decision and actioning so swiftly in the nth minute.",

She is very patient and addressed all our queries and concerns calmly. She took great care of me during pregnancy, specially when the scans showed low amniotic fluid, and prescribed medication that helped me complete full term pregnancy. She was readily available on call and messages even when she was traveling abroad.\nShe encouraged me for normal vaginal delivery and was available round the clock during labor. She managed the delivery so well that I felt almost no pain, and recovered very quickly. She encouraged me to stay active during and after pregnancy. \nThe best thing about her is her positive and calm attitude. We trust her blindly and would recommend her to everyone.",
