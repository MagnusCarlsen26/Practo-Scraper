As we weren't convinced about this recommendation, we sought Dr. Kumari\u2019s advice.\n\nDr. Kumari provided a thorough explanation and a thoughtful alternative, suggesting that we only consider the surgery if it became absolutely necessary. She assured us it might not be needed, and she was right in the end. We chose her as our primary gynecologist for the remainder of my pregnancy.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, Dr. Kumari offered exceptional medical care, friendly guidance, and unwavering support, making a potentially stressful experience into a manageable one. She always insisted for Normal delivery and prepared me thoroughly for it, which is a rare find these days.\n\nFinally, she delivered my healthy baby through a Normal procedure! \n\nIn closing, I am incredibly grateful for her exceptional skill and heartfelt care, and I highly recommend her to anyone seeking the best in gynaecological and obstetric care!",

We chose her as our primary gynecologist for the remainder of my pregnancy.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, Dr. Kumari offered exceptional medical care, friendly guidance, and unwavering support, making a potentially stressful experience into a manageable one. She always insisted for Normal delivery and prepared me thoroughly for it, which is a rare find these days.\n\nFinally, she delivered my healthy baby through a Normal procedure! \n\nIn closing, I am incredibly grateful for her exceptional skill and heartfelt care, and I highly recommend her to anyone seeking the best in gynaecological and obstetric care!",

We have seen Meera Kumari profile and we booked an appointment with her.  From the 1st meet with Meera Kumari we are very satisfied with the treatment and we decided to continue with her. She explains everything with patience and in simple way that you can clear all the doubts in one go. She provided some tips and things to do which are very help full to me during pregnancy. Even she is available through phone and she responses to our doubts, which is very full as we can avoid to visit hospital for small doubts. Coming to my delivery, I got my labor pains bit early than expected due date. We have visited hospital for the same and visited the emergency doctor to confirm whether it's a false contraction or real one as it too early for delivery. For our surprise its a real contraction and we are very tensed. Doctor visited us and done the regular check up and suggested us that it's better to delay the labour for 2 more weeks as its too early and it might be difficult to baby after delivery. She tried her best to slow down the contractions and delay the delivery. But my contractions were same and I got delivered on next day after waiting for 18 hours. We are very satisfied and happy the way Meera Kumari acts to the situations and try to apply all the possible ways to treat it.  Finally we are very happy with her care and support she provided on my entire pregnancy journey.  Thank you Doctor for all the support and care you provided.\n \n\n\n\n\n",

Your role as my obstetrician and gynecologist has been pivotal, and I am immensely grateful for the additional layers of support you offered as a friend, elder sister, and, at times, a stern but caring maternal figure.\nFrom the outset of my pregnancy, you exhibited a high level of professionalism and compassion. Upon reviewing my test results, you promptly advised me to embark on a regimen of regular walks and a controlled diet, given my pre-pregnancy weight. Your clear and concise explanations regarding the necessity of these measures demonstrated your commitment to my well-being. Your consistent follow-ups during each visit ensured that I adhered to the prescribed diet and exercise routine.\nAs a first-time expectant mother, I was naturally filled with anxieties and numerous inquiries. I deeply appreciate your patience in addressing my concerns and providing thorough explanations that helped alleviate my worries. Your accessibility during unconventional hours further exemplified your dedication to your patients.\nUpon reaching the 39th week, when the decision was made to opt for a c-section, I placed unwavering trust in your expertise. The procedure unfolded seamlessly, and your reassuring presence played a significant role in making the experience positive. I vividly recall feeling genuinely content and at ease during the operation, a sentiment attributed to my complete faith in your capabilities.\nPost-c-section, your guidance on postoperative precautions and dietary measures facilitated a remarkably smooth recovery. I am grateful for the meticulous care you extended throughout this phase, which contributed to making my maternity journey a relatively effortless endeavor.\nDr. Meera, thank you sincerely for your unwavering support, genuine care, and expertise that transformed what could have been a challenging period into a truly manageable and positive maternity experience.\n",

In fact we decided not to change our house cause we wanted to stay close to the doctor so that we can continue our pregnancy journey with her. *** *** ***** ***** ** *** *********** ***** *** ********** ********** ********** In fact I am a bit hypochondriac and would ask her many questions and she would patiently listen to us and assure me that everything will be fine. During the last week of pregnancy, Dr was out of station and I had my fingers crossed that I shouldn't go into labor when she is not in town. Finally, on the day of labor I couldn't believe I pulled off a normal delivery. I was induced at 10 AM and went into active labor at around 5, and at 5:45 I delivered a beautiful baby boy safely. 100% recommend her to anyone who resides in South Bangalore. ",

Her patience and advice made the whole process very smooth for us. We also got C-Section procedure done at cloud nine hospital where she works.

She was always available on each call (trust me even during late night hours). She is confident in her treatment and very very positive approach towards everything. Thanks so so much doctor really. It's only bcz of you that I have my cute little baby around me. She really is wonderful and extremely wonderful doctor. She stood by me on the delivery date each moment and comforted me and assured that things will be fine. Really thanks a million times to doctor Meera.
