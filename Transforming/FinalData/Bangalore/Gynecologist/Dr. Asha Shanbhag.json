She was very friendly throughout spending enough time with me ensuring I was completely normal, did not have any apprehensions regarding the cyst or the laparoscopic procedure. Once the procedure was complete, she would follow-up regularly asking if I was all normal and ensured I did not face any post-op complications. \n\nAfter meeting and speaking to Dr Asha it was all encouraging and I was at comfort to go ahead with the procedure. Thank you ma'am for all your support.",

If they can improve the reception and lab stuffs it will be amazing as Doctor is already best. She understand the patients well and make sure that she gives all the required information.

She was very friendly throughout spending enough time with me ensuring I was completely normal, did not have any apprehensions regarding the cyst or the laparoscopic procedure. Once the procedure was complete, she would follow-up regularly asking if I was all normal and ensured I did not face any post-op complications. \n\nAfter meeting and speaking to Dr Asha it was all encouraging and I was at comfort to go ahead with the procedure. Thank you ma'am for all your support.",

She didn't ask to stay in the hospital unnecessarily and didn't prescribe so many medicines. Overall we are very happy and satisfied with consultation. I wish Dr. Asha, serve many more patients and make their loved ones happy.\ud83d\ude0a",

From starting of checking up with her she always suggested n guided me for normal delivery due to its multiple advantages. Now I'm blessed with Baby Boy. My champ is all fine n healthy. We shall be forever grateful to her...
