"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Well I am writing this after around 4 months of my wife's delivery and I want to Thank you Dr. Asha for our successful delivery of twin babies. Our first visit was around at 7 weeks and followed by at 12 weeks. During 7 weeks of scan Dr. has confirmed the twin pregnancy and 12 weeks reports were completely normal with Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Pregnancy (Twin share same placenta). Everything was going healthy and as recommended by Dr. , we went for next checkup/scan at around 20 weeks. During the initial scanning by Junior Dr. they got some doubt and after detailed scanning by senior specialists, they have confirmed that twins has developed ""Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome""-Stage III; a rare pregnancy condition where one twin gives away more blood/nutrients than it receives in return and another one receives too much . If untreated both the babies will die eventually due to organ failure -possibly within one or two weeks. However, as per the suggestion of Dr. Asha and team we went to BFMC and did the Fetal Laser Ablation surgery within 1 week. Yes, obviously everything went well and the surgery was successful and again we visited Dr. Asha at around 27 weeks. Again after there were few complications like severe itching (Liver Cholestasis) in body, low hemoglobin level, Gestational diabetes etc. which Dr. Asha managed very efficiently. There are many instances in which she had guided us through WhatsApp message/call without any hesitation, even after normal working hours. Finally after our last ultrasound scanning Dr. had advised us to get admitted after 7 days and did some routine blood test.  Report came one the same day night in which platelet count for my wife was around 80000 against the normal value of 2.5 lacs. Dr. Asha intervened immediately at 10 pm and directed the Motherhood Lab to do the test again. Obviously same report came within 1 hour which I received by WhatsApp itself. Dr. was doubting it could lead to HELLP syndrome and advised us to get admitted on the same night. Next day afternoon Dr. Asha did the cesarean delivery with two healthy babies. Yes, as I am writing this post after 4 months, both the babies are healthy and growing well. So I would recommend her and would go back if needed. 10 stars from my side.",2021-12-10 12:50:10,False,True,Chandan,,,
