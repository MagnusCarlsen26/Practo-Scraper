She failed to manage the queue and behaved very badly to an extent that she said if you have an issue with your pregnancy you will have to wait for whole day long and what will I do then. The receptionist s on that floor still need to learn about customer service. Please train them properly. It affects the doctor s reputation indirectly.",

I had a follow up appointment with another doctor planned in such a way that I could show the scan results to the next doctor. I had arrived at the doctors reception at 11:15 (half hour before appointment time) and informed the staff. But to my absolute dismay I was not called even after 10 mins after my appointment time. And when I checked with the staff at reception they were not willing to give any explanation other than to say there are 5-6 patients in the list. Finally I was called up 12:45 PM - one hour after the appointment time. And it\u2019s not at all easy sitting in the uncomfortable waiting area benches with a pregnant wife. We missed the next doctors appointment due to this delay and had to stay back in the hospital till 4:30 in the evening to see the gynaecologist since she had gone for break. Over all a traumatic experience and I would strongly recommend people to stay away from the OAR Cloudnine. They don\u2019t value people\u2019s time and have very rude reception staff who treat patients with total disdain. Even when I demanded to speak to someone in charge of grievances they took half an hour to get someone to talk to me.  But no measures were taken to speeden up in the procedures. They simply don\u2019t care about patients well being and I have already changed my future appointments. Will never think of coming back to this place which doesn\u2019t treat customers with respect. \nThe biggest joke was their phone customer service line. Someone picks up the phone and says everything will be alright and says they have limitations on helping us. So it\u2019s better if you make some noise in the hospital itself. I\u2019ve given up on this process. ",

I had a follow up appointment with another doctor planned in such a way that I could show the scan results to the next doctor. I had arrived at the doctors reception at 11:15 (half hour before appointment time) and informed the staff. But to my absolute dismay I was not called even after 10 mins after my appointment time. And when I checked with the staff at reception they were not willing to give any explanation other than to say there are 5-6 patients in the list. Finally I was called up 12:45 PM - one hour after the appointment time. And it\u2019s not at all easy sitting in the uncomfortable waiting area benches with a pregnant wife. We missed the next doctors appointment due to this delay and had to stay back in the hospital till 4:30 in the evening to see the gynaecologist since she had gone for break. Over all a traumatic experience and I would strongly recommend people to stay away from the OAR Cloudnine. They don\u2019t value people\u2019s time and have very rude reception staff who treat patients with total disdain. Even when I demanded to speak to someone in charge of grievances they took half an hour to get someone to talk to me.  But no measures were taken to speeden up in the procedures. They simply don\u2019t care about patients well being and I have already changed my future appointments. Will never think of coming back to this place which doesn\u2019t treat customers with respect. \nThe biggest joke was their phone customer service line. Someone picks up the phone and says everything will be alright and says they have limitations on helping us. So it\u2019s better if you make some noise in the hospital itself. I\u2019ve given up on this process. ",
