Dr. Vidya was incredibly patient, attentively listened to all my concerns, and provided her expert advice. She was always just a message away whenever I needed to reach out remotely, offering reassurance and calming my worries when I panicked. Thanks to her consistent care and treatment, I successfully delivered a healthy baby via cesarean section. I am immensely grateful for her professionalism and dedication throughout my pregnancy. Huge thanks to Dr. Vidya!",

And when diagonised with gestational diabetes ,followed her diet advice and could make it under control without any medication.\nShe always explains the problems or scan details or any health related  in detailed way and that we always feel relaxed after consultation so we know what to be followed.\nAnd also always she is available for any query or emergency on her whatsapp or call.\n \nVery understanding and motivating person and never forces to go on with her opinion alone rather she explains the thing and makes patients to understand the problem first.\nI would highly recommend Dr vidya Gayathri for those who look for a gynaec for baby planning and any other gynaec related.\n\nThank you so much mam !",

On 22nd Aug I had developed  a secondary  PPH and was admitted  in Manipal  hospital  where in the scan it showed RPOC retained  products  of conception  of size 3cm .My previous  gynaecologist  whoam  I consulted for my delivery  said that its a clot , she was confidently  telling  she had cleaned  my uretus  well ..so when I asked for a second  scan she didn't  write for it .As my bleeding  was not stopping  I thought  of going  for a second  opinion  and went to hershe  was very friendly  and heard my story As I had my c section  few weeks bad , she tried  her best through  medicine  to expel the Rpoc  but unfortunately  in the scan it was still there..so she advised  us to do D&C  with ultrasound  guidelines..It was risky  to touch a urteus which had done  c section  few weeks  back..but she gave  us confidence  to go head and she did my surgery .It went good .As my previous  gynecologist who did my delivery  just left me , I was totally  left with no options. But she actually  saved meI would recommend  highly  recommend  her",

Dr. Vidya is a beacon of comforting light amidst the chaos. I had a prepartem delivery in 36th week, I had been for a general checkup on 18th January. Everything was fine and recommended me to visit her next with the growth scan in 37th week. The same night at around 11:30 pm my water broke and I had to rush to the hospital as per Dr. Vidya's advice. My labour pain started and  had a normal delivery with 3rd degree tair. Dr Vidya Gayathri is sooo to the point and so perfect with her comments and crystal clear in her approach that it gives the patient a lot of confidence and belief. She does not expect regular visits , and calls u back only if needed. Doctor Vidya also recommended that I Whatsapp her the reports and don\u2019t see her unless highly necessary thereby saving me the time, effort and money of an in person appointment. I would highly recommend Doctor Vidya.",

And when diagonised with gestational diabetes ,followed her diet advice and could make it under control without any medication.\nShe always explains the problems or scan details or any health related  in detailed way and that we always feel relaxed after consultation so we know what to be followed.\nAnd also always she is available for any query or emergency on her whatsapp or call.\n \nVery understanding and motivating person and never forces to go on with her opinion alone rather she explains the thing and makes patients to understand the problem first.\nI would highly recommend Dr vidya Gayathri for those who look for a gynaec for baby planning and any other gynaec related.\n\nThank you so much mam !",

On 22nd Aug I had developed  a secondary  PPH and was admitted  in Manipal  hospital  where in the scan it showed RPOC retained  products  of conception  of size 3cm .My previous  gynaecologist  whoam  I consulted for my delivery  said that its a clot , she was confidently  telling  she had cleaned  my uretus  well ..so when I asked for a second  scan she didn't  write for it .As my bleeding  was not stopping  I thought  of going  for a second  opinion  and went to hershe  was very friendly  and heard my story As I had my c section  few weeks bad , she tried  her best through  medicine  to expel the Rpoc  but unfortunately  in the scan it was still there..so she advised  us to do D&C  with ultrasound  guidelines..It was risky  to touch a urteus which had done  c section  few weeks  back..but she gave  us confidence  to go head and she did my surgery .It went good .As my previous  gynecologist who did my delivery  just left me , I was totally  left with no options.

Dr. Vidya is a beacon of comforting light amidst the chaos. I had a prepartem delivery in 36th week, I had been for a general checkup on 18th January. Everything was fine and recommended me to visit her next with the growth scan in 37th week. The same night at around 11:30 pm my water broke and I had to rush to the hospital as per Dr. Vidya's advice. My labour pain started and  had a normal delivery with 3rd degree tair. Dr Vidya Gayathri is sooo to the point and so perfect with her comments and crystal clear in her approach that it gives the patient a lot of confidence and belief. She does not expect regular visits , and calls u back only if needed. Doctor Vidya also recommended that I Whatsapp her the reports and don\u2019t see her unless highly necessary thereby saving me the time, effort and money of an in person appointment. I would highly recommend Doctor Vidya.",

Had a miscarriage last year and we approached her with lot of questions. But she stayed calm and explained about pcod and gave us some suggestions and medicines, which in turn helped me to get conceive again. From day 1 , everything was taken care carefully. After 6th month, got pregnancy diabetes and bp fluctuations but she handled and it was taken care and watched very closely. Thank you so much Mam for the positive vibes and all your support which helped us in delivering our little healthy princess on 4th dec 2020.Would highly recommend to All.",

So I was very much afraid to opt for a second c-section but Dr Vidhya was the best choice I made. I felt really relaxed after consultations.

But meeting Dr Vidya Gayatri for a 2nd opinion really changed my perspective. I felt very positive about myself and overall pregnancy. I immediately switched to her and am glad to have taken the right decision at right time. \n\nShe had lot of patience to hear me in detail, explain my complications and always gave me positive perspective about things. With her, my last one month of pregnancy and overall delivery was very smooth. Thank you so much Doctor for this joyful experience in otherwise a complicated pregnancy.",

Even though that doctor was renowned but personally I found her extremely busy, un-approachable, and emotionally insensitive because of which we decided to change the doctor. Based on feedback from one of our friends we switched to Dr. Vidya Gayathri. Dr. Vidya Gayathri was not only knowledgeable (e.g. she detected and treated a rare infection which was missed by previous doctor) but also very approachable, polite, patient, available on WhatsApp for instances where we need doctor's opinion (as this was our first pregnancy, their were numerous instances where an \"Ok\", \"It's normal\" brings down your anxiety). Towards 7th month of pregnancy my wife had \"Obstetric Cholestasis\"; to address this she clearly explained us the complications involved along-with monitoring the LFT levels closely. To my astonishment, she even remembered the critical numbers related to the treatment, reports. There has been instances where-in we had numerous queries, she addressed each with a medical reason which helped a lot to bring down the anxiety. Finally, we were blessed with a baby girl last month and I truly treasure and recommend her as a doctor and individual. Be rest assured that you are in safe hands!       ",

She was very encouraging and would answer all my doubts immediately in whatsapp. She doesn't give unwanted scan. She gives the low cost scan and the she gives us the freedom of choosing the scan center. She is very friendly and optimistic. \n\nShe solved my many problems as below\nUrinary Infection\nLow amniotic fluid\nPost surgery she used to answer all my queries without charging single penny in whatsapp which saved lot of money and time \n\nDuring covid situation she did not panic us. She took more care like mother and never suggested any unwanted test. She gave us full confidence throughout my pregnancy\n\nIn last checkup of my pregnancy she did membrane sweep two weeks before due date without asking my concern if she can proceed. Though it's a safe procedure which did not work for me\n\nMy water broke with no pain ended up in c section. May be she could have waited one more week for my labour pain. My kind request for her is to ask the patient if membrane sweep is ok or not as many patients aren't aware. Having said that iam no doctor to comment on. Each body is different.",
