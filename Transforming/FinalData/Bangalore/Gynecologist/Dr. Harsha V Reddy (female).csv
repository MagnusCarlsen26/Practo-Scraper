"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"One of the best decision I made was to consult dr. Harsha. I was initially taking treatment from other hospital bcos of some personal reasons switched my doctor. When I met dr. Harsha with my previous reports (6th month of pregnancy) she has gone through all the reports, explained the situation and asked to continue same tablets, encouraged me to have healthy diet and excersise. My second and third trimester journey was really smooth bcos of her advices. 
At the end of third trimester she explained clearly abt all the scenarios of delivery process. When I was in 39th weeks ,she said that baby weight is seems to be higher than normal range if we wait till natural labour pains then baby might gain more weight in that case labour process would be difficult. So she said will induce labour and try for normal delivery if not possible will go for C-section. 
On the of delivery she suggested me to get one more scan. By seeing those reports ( baby's weight and head circumference was large) she suggested and clearly explaind that NVT would be difficult if we proceed with that it may hurt baby, will go for C-section. My family also agreed for C-section bcoz baby was too large and we want our baby to be safe. Then finally we accepted for C-section but we wanted the operation on a particular time. Finalised time slot, on the day of operation she was exactly on time and operation also completed on scheduled time. We were blessed with a cute and healthy baby boy. 
We were very happy and very much satisfied with Dr's service. We always remember her and would defenatly recommend dr. Harsha to my friends and family members.

My initial  treatment started in home town because we were working from home during COVID. When my husband's office started and we came down to Bangalore, I was really concerned about changing doctor during my 5th month of pregnancy. I did all my research before meeting her and was too much worried about how will she react after knowing that I am changing doctor at this time. But there she was, too much calm and she went through all my previous reports one by one and made a note of all of it. She was very clear in her instructions. Also, the most important thing was she didn't change or added any of my medicines.

I know it's gonna be a long story here but after few more visits, I got infected with COVID. She used to respond to all my emails and gave proper instructions. Also, at around 7th month of my pregnancy, in my scan I was diagnosed with short cervix and I was having gestational diabetes as well. She gave clear instructions on what could happen and asked me to follow strict diet and complete bedrest. Also, I could deliver prematurely, so she gave medicines and injections accordingly so that I can deliver at the right time.

I followed complete bed rest, blood sugar monitoring and strict diet during pregnancy. And with her help, there came when I was into my 37th week and I went to her for 9th month check up. She examined me physically and said that I am already 2cm dilated. She asked me to get admitted on the same day as I was going to deliver today. I was really worried and was literally sweating. But she seemed excited of me delivering at the same day. At around 8 PM in evening, I got admitted to hospital and around 12 AM , I was fully dilated. I was not able to push for around 2 hrs, but there she was giving her clear instructions and she had to wait 2 hrs for me to push. She was still calm in her words and didn't shouted even once. She was always saying that you can do it. With all her help I could deliver normally at around 2 am in the morning. I am really blessed to be consulting with such a good doctor. As a human being also, she is  quite good.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES," I have consulted with Dr. Harsha at CloudNine, Bellandur for ObGyn. Initially when I was looking for gynaecologist in  Bellandur area I came across reviews of Dr. Harsha Reddy on online forums. Reading these reviews I was convinced that she dedicates her time to your case, does thorough check on med history and prepares a personalised consultation routine. I experienced the above when I consulted for early pregnancy in Sept 2019. Dr. Harsha advised me on the nutrition and supplements. Based on ultrasound scan reviews and pregnancy progress she revised the medications, nutrition info, supplements and exercise routines. But she never has advised on medicines or scans unnecessarily...  She has a calming presence which helps soothe anxious moms like me. She will ask if you have doubts or anxiety at every visit. With COVID-19 restrictions coming in early 2020, visits to Clinic had to be reduced. I was glad that the video consultations with Dr. Harsha helped keep the health routines in check. During 3rd trimester, for physical consultations, Dr. Harsha provided overview of future consultations so that all bookings including scans could be advance booked.  Nearing delivery, she would check in on me and be available on call as well as come to the clinic for any unplanned checkup. We had opted for natural delivery and Dr. Harsha was committed to easing the process for us. Since I went into labor before the due date, she examined and  advised to get admitted for delivery and really calmed me down. Dr. Harsha and labour room team were by my side through the labor and delivery. They kept me motivated and focused on the natural delivery and supported me (emotionally, mentally and physically) throughout. I thank her for being by my side through this journey and helping us bring our bundle of joy to the world.",2020-10-03 16:09:47,False,True,Shweta,,,
"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES," Dr Harsha V Reddy is a true professional and she spends enough time to understand every minute detail to provide the right treatment, recommendation and minimal medications to her patients. We were planning for kid and had some issues including miscarriage in past, my friends 
 even suggesting for IVF as an option to avoid further delay but with her expert advice, in the same month we got pregnant without any special/expensive treatment and our journey began.During the pregnancy doctor advised right medicines, diet and activities to ensure both remain healthy. She would ask all relevant questions and pay very close attention to each aspect and keep the couple educated and confident. We got her best support through out the pregnancy.When my wife was admitted for delivery, she was not there in the hospital owing to covid situation and I was worried but what I realised soon is she is in constant touch with the patient and the staff (literally 24x7) and though she were to perform the surgery next day, she was there in the hospital same day evening coz she felt something isn’t right and after her inspection, she explained that the baby have passed urine and we shouldn’t wait for normal delivery and got the csection done.Baby and the mother were doing good after the surgery, the stitches were hardly seen, that’s how perfectly the surgery was done. It’s 2 months now, everything is fine and this wouldn’t be so smooth had we consulted any other doctor.
She is an angel for us!

We would like to express our gratitude towards Dr Harsha for guiding us throughout the Journey and achieving the normal delivery despite of the complications. Overall, it was a great experience to go through the paternity under the guidance of Harsha and we would like to recommend Harsha for couples looking for normal and healthy delivery.
Consultation: 
We started consulting Dr Harsha from 1st month of pregnancy. Harsha helped us with the overall consultations, open suggestions on the tests which are mandatory and tests which can be nice to have etc. We expressed our wish to go for normal delivery and she started providing the tips like regular exercises, balanced diet and managing the sleep cycles etc.
After 7th month, she was able to help us with video calls due to covid. During 9th month, we went to hospital only for the mandatory tests/ checkups.

Delivery: 
Mother got the labour pain on the previous night and got hospitalized by 11PM. Doctor Harsha attended us in the hospital and helped with the initial check-ups in the labour room. It was a very long labour of 12+ hours. It was found that the baby's position is complicated and the normal delivery would be difficult. But Dr. Harsha and team was able to help the mother for the normal delivery and the overall experience was really wonderful. Father was also allowed inside the labour room and OT and witnessed the event of joy. 
After the delivery, the mother and baby were shifted to the private rooms and Dr visited regularly to check the health of mother and do the inspection of the episiotomy related recovery.

We are grateful to Dr Harsha for everything.

With all my past consultations with her somehow I knew and had faith and confidence on what she says and I followed exactly the way she said and finally later I was so blessed to have baby boy delivered normally.
 
During pregnancy i had complaint of severe abdomen and back pain for which she conducted tests to find the route cause and recommended us to meet gastroenterologist as there were gallstone found in ultrasound to avoid any future complication due to ignorance and later she provided medication.
She is crystal clear and explains every necessary required information.

Another case i had was post delivery was my stitches got infection and i was in tremendous pain.When we visited her she examined and was so concerned and told me in why i didn't call her and had all these pain. Later she gave ****** medication and those were healed. Her intention and care for her patient shows how sincere she is at her work.
We are very thankful to her and now i feel a personal bond with her due to her now despite of the fact that it is a doctor patient relationship.

Thank you so much Dr. Harsha😊
