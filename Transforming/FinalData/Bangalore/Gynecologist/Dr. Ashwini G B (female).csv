"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"It was overwhelming experience with Dr Ashwini Mam. And is the fact that, It's very rare to find a doctor like Dr Ashwini Mam, very special, highly qualified, committed, innovative, expert in all latest medical technologies/procedures, highly experienced, commendable and approachable, explains very clear on the situation and advises only required treatment.
Day 1, we met Dr Ashwini Mam, we found the hope, trust and got a confidence that, we are in right and safe hands.
Dr Ashwini Mam is very kind, transparent, swift,understands the problem very well and directs the concrete, crisp, and right treatment. Also explains the anticipated/probable chances very clearly.
One important point, measures the risk very well and mitigates with all possible precautionary medicines/procedures to reduce the risk at the maximum.
At times, when situation is little critical, Dr Ashwini Mam is more concerned than anyone. Mam is always very supportive, provides instant plenty of solutions/options with medicines/alternative to medicines to avoid any side effects.
What we observed and realized that, always there is a solution for all your problems with Dr Ashwini Mam, and you realize it one by one which we could’t in earlier hospitals.
Wholeheartedly thanks to Dr Ashwini Mam for the life time gifts(We blessed with Angel & Prince).Absolutely no words to express, like us, think how many families got the gifts, really it’s a pride, gratitude, much pleased to be lucky to get the treatment/care under Dr Ashwini Mam.
Take this opportunity to thank Dr Narmatha Mam for all your treatment,scans, support, care, for everything, thank you Mam.
Also, would like to thank all the staff who supported all the way and helped in each phases. Always treated us as Aspire Family members, very polite, supportive, experienced and demonstrating solidarity, smilefull posture is a key motive of Aspire staff and its the indication of right place, Doctors and faculty and feel the confidence of positive hope. Dr. Ashwini Mam has not only given us a ray of hope, but also gave smile on our face to be blessed and cherish for the rest of our life.
We cannot forget how each phases the Dr Ashwini Mam shown us a kindness, care and support is really a pride and blessed. My words will be countless to express my gratitude, thank you for everything and we wish you a very all the best for all future endeavors, wishing to fulfill/achieve all your ambitions, dreams comes true Mam.
