Before my pregnancy began, she did a through check up and recommended a medicine. Took that fr a couple of months and I finally conceived. After that it was a smooth ride all through till my baby was delivered and post delivery also she was just awesome. She is a very polite and friendly doctor who explains everything in detail and is very vigilant always. I would recommend her happily to any couple who is planning to have a baby or is in process or to any woman who needs a gynaecologist.\nShe has been always available for me on call / on WhatsApp for any of my queries during this pandemic situation.",

All through  moments of my life I always felt if my mother was alive it would have been great during this struggle. But Dr Kumudini was caring and comforting and I felt my mother  back again.\nShe advised me  at the right time  during all these weeks and I am proud mother today. My daughter born two days ago.

Due to my Endometriosis condition she had explained beforehand that there's a need to go for open surgery if any  complications are found through Laparoscopic surgery. That's what happened during surgery. I was taken good care at hospital and got discharged in 3 days. Now I am recovering well and all my pains have disappeared. Many  Thanks to Dr. Kumudini and team.",

I could give 100 starts to her!!!",

Dr Kumudini Devi was my consultant from the begining and she took care of me very well and was involved personally in shaping up during this period of 39 weeks. She is able Gynaecologist not willing to take any risk and took care of me with constant follow up. All through  moments of my life I always felt if my mother was alive it would have been great during this struggle. But Dr Kumudini was caring and comforting and I felt my mother  back again.\nShe advised me  at the right time  during all these weeks and I am proud mother today. My daughter born two days ago. No words will replace my gratitude to her and I am very very happy \ud83d\ude4f",
