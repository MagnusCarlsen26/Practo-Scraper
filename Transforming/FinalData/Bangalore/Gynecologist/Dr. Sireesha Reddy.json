Then one day I consulted Dr. Sireesha @ Columbia Asia Hebbal. *** ** **** ** ***** ** *** \n\nHer pleasant personality and the rejuvenating smile took away half of my nervousness. She is very humble and gives attention to each and every small things about your health. During my 6th month of pregnancy, I developed Gestational Diabetes. I was very scared that this might affect the baby as well but she handled it with so much of personal care that I sailed it through smoothly. \n\nMy sugar level was very high hence I had to attach a insulin cartridge device to my body which helped me to balance continuous & flow of insulin in my body. As per her guidance I had to keep noting down each and every reading of sugar level for 3 times a day.It was very complicated but she gave me so much confidence that it looked all easy & simple to me.\n\nFinally the day came when I got admitted. Due to my Diabetes Dr. had to induce Labor. Everything was going smooth, I was going through the labor pain for almost 3 hours then in the midnight around 3:45 they had noticed that the heart beat of the baby was going down. From 140 heart beat per minute it came down to 60. This was scary as it could have costed the life of the little one. After this everything happened as speed of light.The nurse informed the Dr. and with in no time she was standing in front of me. That time my water bag was also not broken. They had to break it manually and immediately took me to the Operation theater and by early morning around 4:20 the baby was out. \n\nI was amazed to see the speed and action to execute things so fast by Dr. Sireesha. Through out my pregnancy, she has been standing beside me like my guardian ****** I have got lot of gratitude towards her.\nI strongly recommend her. In spite of so many complications in my pregnancy I delivered a very healthy baby. It was all possible because of Dr. Sireesha.\nThank you so much.. May God bless you.",

It is recommended if you enroll for the same at the beginning of second trimester. Few things we liked in the package was the Lamaze classes, Baby Shower, Personalized diet chart, and hassle free consultations and tests. The gift hampers for the mom and baby are also worth mentioning. We consulted Dr.Sireesha Reddy and are extremely happy with the way she guided us throughout the journey. She is very knowledgable and more importantly has a lot of patience and makes you comfortable to discuss any issues. We highly recommend the doctor. Regarding the delivery, we had a C-section and the involved doctors which include Dr.Sireesha Reddy, Dr. Prabhakar(Anaesthesia), and Dr.Pradeep(Neonatologist) made the entire delivery process very smooth. The nurse staff were extremely firendly with the mom and baby, food provided by the hospital to the mom was again of top-notch quality. We would also like to appreciate Sameena(who handles 9-Divine package) has always helped us in getting the appointments for consultations whenever needed. Overall, extremely happy with the entire experience and I want to conclude with one last thing \"Maternity at Motherhood, Sahakaranagar is an EXPERIENCE\".",

We consulted her when we knew my wife was pregnant for second time exactly after 5 months from the first delivery and she explained all  possible ways and gave a lot of moral support. That's when I thought we have come to a right person inpisite right place and it was proved correct. Even a couple of days back we saw her for a checkup after 8 months of second delivery and she was even more caring in treating my wife. Also, she gives propmt response to your emails with any health concers. \n\nSireesha Madam, I'm not sure if you will get to see this feedback or not, but let me please thank you from bottom of heart for the treatment that you have given so far to my wife.

Then one day I consulted Dr. Sireesha @ Columbia Asia Hebbal. *** ** **** ** ***** ** *** \n\nHer pleasant personality and the rejuvenating smile took away half of my nervousness. She is very humble and gives attention to each and every small things about your health. During my 6th month of pregnancy, I developed Gestational Diabetes. I was very scared that this might affect the baby as well but she handled it with so much of personal care that I sailed it through smoothly. \n\nMy sugar level was very high hence I had to attach a insulin cartridge device to my body which helped me to balance continuous & flow of insulin in my body. As per her guidance I had to keep noting down each and every reading of sugar level for 3 times a day.It was very complicated but she gave me so much confidence that it looked all easy & simple to me.\n\nFinally the day came when I got admitted. Due to my Diabetes Dr. had to induce Labor. Everything was going smooth, I was going through the labor pain for almost 3 hours then in the midnight around 3:45 they had noticed that the heart beat of the baby was going down. From 140 heart beat per minute it came down to 60. This was scary as it could have costed the life of the little one. After this everything happened as speed of light.The nurse informed the Dr. and with in no time she was standing in front of me. That time my water bag was also not broken. They had to break it manually and immediately took me to the Operation theater and by early morning around 4:20 the baby was out. \n\nI was amazed to see the speed and action to execute things so fast by Dr. Sireesha. Through out my pregnancy, she has been standing beside me like my guardian ****** I have got lot of gratitude towards her.\nI strongly recommend her. In spite of so many complications in my pregnancy I delivered a very healthy baby. It was all possible because of Dr. Sireesha.\nThank you so much.. May God bless you.",

It is recommended if you enroll for the same at the beginning of second trimester. Few things we liked in the package was the Lamaze classes, Baby Shower, Personalized diet chart, and hassle free consultations and tests. The gift hampers for the mom and baby are also worth mentioning. We consulted Dr.Sireesha Reddy and are extremely happy with the way she guided us throughout the journey. She is very knowledgable and more importantly has a lot of patience and makes you comfortable to discuss any issues. We highly recommend the doctor. Regarding the delivery, we had a C-section and the involved doctors which include Dr.Sireesha Reddy, Dr. Prabhakar(Anaesthesia), and Dr.Pradeep(Neonatologist) made the entire delivery process very smooth. The nurse staff were extremely firendly with the mom and baby, food provided by the hospital to the mom was again of top-notch quality. We would also like to appreciate Sameena(who handles 9-Divine package) has always helped us in getting the appointments for consultations whenever needed. Overall, extremely happy with the entire experience and I want to conclude with one last thing \"Maternity at Motherhood, Sahakaranagar is an EXPERIENCE\".",

Also she is available at any time , and responds prompt to query anytime to her patients through email or mobile.\nDr Sireesha Reddy, she is one such doctor  who insist on normal delivery who are really hard to find these days.\nI really have to tell this:\nDuring my labor in the last few minutes I was never confident of delivering the baby \"normal\" , I was feeling really tired and felt it's not possible as the entire labour and pain took for 15 hours long \n, due to which my  entire energy got drained and I had no energy to push the baby out but the minute Dr Sireesha Reddy arrived , the confidence she gave me at that moment really helped in pushing and the baby was finally \"out\", I was actually suprised at myself that I  could finally do it.I can't thank her enough for motivating me to do it.\nFinally I would  like to say the entire experince of my pregnancy and delivery went really smooth because of Dr Sireesha Reddy and ofcourse motherhood hebbal.\nI strongly recommend Dr Sireesha Reddy, *** ** *** **** ***** ** *** * **** **** *******\n\n",

Thanks for showing so much care and concern.More than a good doctor, I value the fact that you are a good listener. I value the fact that your attitude is exceptional. Thank you mam.The very thought of hospitalization is scary and traumatizing. But caring doctors like you make it friendly and pleasing.\nNine months of my pregnancy could have been a nightmare without your medical supervision. Thanks for making my journey to become a mommy nothing less than a dream come true.Good doctors like you replace the Fear of Illness with Trust in Recovery. Thanks a lot mam.",

From the moment we entered her room, she made us feel extremely comfortable. She did have a lot of patients waiting to go in after me, but there was no rushing of any sort. She herself went into detail about the matter and answered every question me and my mom had at length. She brushed aside all my fears  and told me not to worry too much and that whatever the results of the blood test was we could completely handle it together with appropriate medication and lifestyle changes. Her calm nature and reassuring words made me see why people were willing to wait for hours to consult her!",
