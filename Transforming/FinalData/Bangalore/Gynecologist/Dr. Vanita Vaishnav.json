I gave ypu an option of Apollo as it is registered for MTP , plus it was meeting your requirements of having everything( consult and scan) at the same place. \n\n3. I had given you a very clear picture of the MTP package, with inclusions and exclusions.  It's pre decided by the clinic. Doctors don't interfere and don't don't have any say in it. \n\n4. Every absence from the clinic doesn't mean vacation. It can be emergencies( personal or professional). And like you said you had travel plan, doctors also have their plans and holidays. And as I said to you- I wouldnt prefer to change my clinical guidelines and procedure methods based on patients personal  issues. If your yravel plan was more important than the MTP, you are free to decide accordingly. \n\n5. I share my number for Real emergencies and sharing reports. I prefer in person discussion for other queries. \n\n6. I gave you the contraceptive advise. You were always free to ask more if it wasn't clear or you wanted other advise. \n\n7. Depression - happened a month later  after your MTP.  Treating depression isn't my clinical qualification... And replying to such messages also isn't medicolegally advised for us. There can be various reasons for depression. Would suggest you to meet a clinician for the same. \n\n8. Feel free to go to a pharmacy and take the treatment . I gave you options, and you chose doctor and clinic. \n\nI hope all your queries are answered. \n\nWish you safery and good health. \n ",

And also the guidance on contraceptives methods were also a part of the procedure.\nso she asked us to come back and take an ultrasound after a week or so of the procedure at Apollo only. we went there on time only to find out she wasn't there and probably was on vacation. we still didn't mind and had a call with her. the way she talked was not the same as she was talking before the amount was paid( actually we told, we were leaving the city soon, so would be better if she can meet or guide us further on contraception, she replied- just because u are leaving the city does not change my procedure). after the call, we went and asked the receptionist about the ultrasound. ohh God, the service that clinic provides is very bad, nobody pays attention to the patients, faced total ignorance from the entire team and the guy who was to do the ultrasound. after a long verbal spat, they kind of sent us to some other diagnostic centre. things at that diagnostic centre were fine.\nso after the ultrasound and after few days, i was facing some serious depression, which i wanted to discuss with the doctor and thought may be she could give some input , but there wasn't any reply. i ignored and went on to ask about the contraceptive methods which she told she would definitely help with as its part of the procedure. messages were getting read , but i never got a single reply from her.\nbut the same doc until payment was done was replying to me normally. * ***** **** **** **** *** * *** **** **** ******* ***** **** ****** * *** *** *** **** * ********* ***** **** **** *** **** *** ********",

Her calm yet stern way of advising the right consulting helped us in our beautiful endeavor.  From the joyous morning when we got the news of pregnancy to the day when our bub arrived, Dr. has always been the mentor beyond her professional duty. As the EOD arrived, clear expectations were relayed and this helped us make the decision. Both as a gynecologist and obstetrician, Dr. Vanita is the best in the city and we highly recommend.\nMy wife found solace in her guidance and we are forever grateful. \nRegards,\nVishal and Deepali",

She was always reachable and would respond to our calls/messages immediately. In the end, our child had to be delivered at 35 weeks and she helped deliver the child successfully.

I gave ypu an option of Apollo as it is registered for MTP , plus it was meeting your requirements of having everything( consult and scan) at the same place. \n\n3. I had given you a very clear picture of the MTP package, with inclusions and exclusions.  It's pre decided by the clinic. Doctors don't interfere and don't don't have any say in it. \n\n4. Every absence from the clinic doesn't mean vacation. It can be emergencies( personal or professional). And like you said you had travel plan, doctors also have their plans and holidays. And as I said to you- I wouldnt prefer to change my clinical guidelines and procedure methods based on patients personal  issues. If your yravel plan was more important than the MTP, you are free to decide accordingly. \n\n5. I share my number for Real emergencies and sharing reports. I prefer in person discussion for other queries. \n\n6. I gave you the contraceptive advise. You were always free to ask more if it wasn't clear or you wanted other advise. \n\n7. Depression - happened a month later  after your MTP.  Treating depression isn't my clinical qualification... And replying to such messages also isn't medicolegally advised for us. There can be various reasons for depression. Would suggest you to meet a clinician for the same. \n\n8. Feel free to go to a pharmacy and take the treatment . I gave you options, and you chose doctor and clinic. \n\nI hope all your queries are answered. \n\nWish you safery and good health. \n ",

And also the guidance on contraceptives methods were also a part of the procedure.\nso she asked us to come back and take an ultrasound after a week or so of the procedure at Apollo only. we went there on time only to find out she wasn't there and probably was on vacation. we still didn't mind and had a call with her. the way she talked was not the same as she was talking before the amount was paid( actually we told, we were leaving the city soon, so would be better if she can meet or guide us further on contraception, she replied- just because u are leaving the city does not change my procedure). after the call, we went and asked the receptionist about the ultrasound. ohh God, the service that clinic provides is very bad, nobody pays attention to the patients, faced total ignorance from the entire team and the guy who was to do the ultrasound. after a long verbal spat, they kind of sent us to some other diagnostic centre. things at that diagnostic centre were fine.\nso after the ultrasound and after few days, i was facing some serious depression, which i wanted to discuss with the doctor and thought may be she could give some input , but there wasn't any reply. i ignored and went on to ask about the contraceptive methods which she told she would definitely help with as its part of the procedure. messages were getting read , but i never got a single reply from her.\nbut the same doc until payment was done was replying to me normally. * ***** **** **** **** *** * *** **** **** ******* ***** **** ****** * *** *** *** **** * ********* ***** **** **** *** **** *** ********",

Her calm yet stern way of advising the right consulting helped us in our beautiful endeavor.  From the joyous morning when we got the news of pregnancy to the day when our bub arrived, Dr. has always been the mentor beyond her professional duty. As the EOD arrived, clear expectations were relayed and this helped us make the decision. Both as a gynecologist and obstetrician, Dr. Vanita is the best in the city and we highly recommend.\nMy wife found solace in her guidance and we are forever grateful. \nRegards,\nVishal and Deepali",

We are very greatful to Dr. Vanita and highly recommend her to anyone looking for a good obstetrician. ",

The clinic is poorly managed, don't pick up calls, callous. I followed up with thrm for reports of the pap smear for a week - 10 days - they kept saying it wasn't ready. Finally when I went and checked, found that they had thrown away the sample.  Though it was their fault/ mistake they didn't refund the amount. They said they will conduct another - I let them keep the money rather than put myself at risk again. Suggest avoid both.",
