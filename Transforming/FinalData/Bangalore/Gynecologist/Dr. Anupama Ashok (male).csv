"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility,",0,0,YES,"'When you truly want something, the entire universe conspires to make it happen. You just have to ask for the impossible, in prayer.'I was diagnosed with stage IV Adenomyosis and endometriosis; blocked tubes. I was left with no hopes what so ever of conceiving.Time was ticking away too! I consider myself extremely fortunate to have crossed paths with Dr. Anupama Ashok. She has been the driving force right from inception. What seemed impossible in the beginning, she literally made me walk baby steps. Dr. Anupama is such a humble and down to earth person. You rarely come across such a gem of a person. She exactly knows what she is doing and even the times I doubted myself, she held up my spirits. She has this beautiful aura that you just want to close your eyes and let her lead you. She has this unshakeable faith in God and in everything she does. Her expertise in the field is unparalleled. She has an excellent team working for her at Amogha Fertility Clinic. No fancy clinic, no pompous showoff , no handing out exorbitant IVF packages. Her simplicity is what drew me to her and made me believe strongly. Right from inception, she has always explained each and everything in a clear manner. Despite being so busy, she has answered all my queries over call or whatsapp, checked on me. Just by meeting her and talking to her, half of my worries were put to rest. I knew I was at the right place! She has this calm persona! She went out of her way and helped us out. It's through her sheer determination, expert guidance and unshakeable faith in God that has made the miracle happen. I got pregnant with 1 cycle of Frozen Embryo Transfer. I and my husband will forever be indebted to her. I want each and every couple battling infertility to reach out to Dr. Anupama Ashok at Amogha Fertility Clinic.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We had the good luck of meeting Dr Anupama Ashok after a long and tiring journey of trying to conceive. My husband and I are 37yrs of age and do not have any diagnosed fertility issues. Previous doctors scared us and put us through multiple failed medicated , IUI and IVF cycles resulting in complete lack of confidence in us to have a baby.

It was at this stage we met Dr. Anupama Ashok -  I was able to find hope right from our first consultation. She is methodical, thorough and has so much clarity in what steps to take to achieve our objective. She is patient and is always forthcoming in explaining the process clearly and answering all our questions. She makes you feel in control and includes you as an integral part of the decision making process.

She uses the best quality meds,  individualised protocols and latest research to achieve optimum results -  our first cycle itself has been successful with her and we are on our way to having a healthy child.

She is constantly in touch with us and checks on us to see if everything is going fine - even when we are transferred to a gynaecologist. We are so happy to have met such a kind human being.",2022-08-16 08:06:13,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr Anupama ma'am was referred to us by another very well known doctor after I, Aruna, suffered ectopic pregnancy. We decided to approach her for the treatment. She was very kind, calm and composed. Before going through treatment she would explain all the stages and also everything I would go through. Anupama ma'am was very careful about the process initiation as she knew exactly which cycle would be more effective. She wouldn't delegate everything to subordinates as she followed the tests and results closely. We would visit her diligently as we had put all our faith on her. Though the first time I didn't conceive, Anupama ma'am gave confidence to us explaining the reason why it was not positive and persuaded to try again. We decided to try another time. There were times when the process was getting delayed for unforeseen issues and we were feeling uneasy. Nevertheless, we persisted to follow and finally the efforts bore fruit. Today we are parents to a healthy boy, our bundle of joy!! Words fall short of expressing gratitude to her. Thank you Dr Anupama Ma'am!!

Being aged 35+, I had lost count of number of times I have undergone IUI and IVF at very well known fertility experts in Mumbai, but to no avail. I was closely following my sister's fertility treatment. And when the efforts bore fruit, I had a ray of hope. Though my body had known the pain of those injections piercing me umpteen number of times, I decided to try one last time. I had to give up my flourishing career and I was mentally prepared for that too. As my sister said Dr Anupama ma'am was very kind, calm and composed. She would closely follow the cycles, my tests and results. During the pandemic, she had advised to postpone the treatment which again increased my anxiety. Finally she herself called up asking to undergo the test again. Her attention to detail and the sense of urgency impressed me a lot! Today I have a success story growing in me. Thank you Dr Anupama Ma'am. As my sister says, Words fall short of expressing gratitude to her! I would recommend her to everyone.",2021-07-31 11:48:14,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
