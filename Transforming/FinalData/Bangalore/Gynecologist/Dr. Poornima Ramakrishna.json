My wife had not so good first time pregnancy, so in second time i was more worried and looking for doctor who justified the phrase doctors are equivalent to god.\n\n\nAnd my wife is delighted after meeting her and she knows our babys in safe hand.\nSecond month is going on will update further later.\n\nNow planning to take the package as doctors presence delight me and my wife .And it gives  a great confidence.\n\nI am updating the review due to the kind of love she has provided during pregnancy. During 2nd trimester my wife diagnosed  with dengu. And i had no other option to rush dr Poornima to save baby and mother. And after seeing my wife's condition she had taken full responsibility. And adviced hospital staff for full attention. And she used to visit twice to see the improvement with the treatment. And i came to know that my baby is in safe hand. \n\nAnd during third trimester ,my wife diagnosed with diabetes. Firstly she convinced my wife that nothing can harm you. And she started giving full attention to my wife in every visit. And slowly with proper examination we progressed to the 9th month of pregnancy  . As we were having bad past with normal delivery .We asked doctor for c section. Then she explained us the pros and cons of normal delivery and c section. She clearly told us as normal delivery has various advantage ,i cant ignore it. But she had given us faith that ,in any emergency we will plan for c section. So on the delivery day, due to water leakage we got admitted early .As it was indication of normal delivery pain ,we got admitted early.And we waited for 4 hours for pain to increase as water loss was more and chances of something serious damage was there. As confirmed earlier by the doctor , she would act according to patient conditon. And she  decided for c section. And she has already arranged all experts from hospital as precautions due to past history. And the operation was successful .And she came back with smiley face to inform us the successful delivery of baby.\n\nAnd i am writing all this to show my gratitude for her. She cared us like her own child from the beginning till end.",

We started consulting doctor from the third month of our pregnancy. We were in confusion whether to continue the old doctor or should we consult Dr Poornima. In this dilemma our 3rd month scan got delayed by 2 days. AfTer so much thinking we opted for Dr Poornima. Our first visit she saw our last doctor\u2019s case sheet. And asked our 3rd month scan details, we said we are planing to do it here with you. Doc scolded my wife like anything, literally she made my wife cry. Then she explained both of us how important to do the scans on the exact dates, in particularly the 3rd month scan. I asked my wife due to want continue with this doctor. My wife said I want this Doctor only. After that everything was spl. We enjoyed our parenthood thoroughly. Doctors explains everything. We asked for normal delivery. Doctor supported us so much. My wife was 32 at that time pregnancy and it\u2019s our first baby. Dr Poornima is a strong personality, very strict and informative. If you trust her fully I tell you she will keep up the word what she tells you. No matter what. In the last month doctor gave her personal Whatsapp number too, to be in touch and to answer our doubts. On the delivery day, We went through more than 20 hours of labour. She was monitoring my wife through out the day. My wife couldn\u2019t meet the 10cm opening on the delivery day, doctor being so patiently  waited and waited. If it\u2019s any other doctor they would have performed the C section. Then finally she performed normal delivery to my wife. My baby boy weighted 3.8kg, both mother and baby was healthy. I still remember what doctor said after coming out from the OT Big Baby, and my wife is a strong woman. I should tell you one thing our baby birth happened during the first wave of covid. She has been like a family member when we are in hospital. Once you go to her, trust her fully. You may find her very strict. *** *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** True Doctor. ",

What initially seemed like a high risk pregnancy (I was on bed rest for first 3 months due to bleeding) turned out to be a wonderful experience for me with a normal delivery. The reason I decided to consult her is because of her reputation in normal deliveries.\n \nI wouldn\u2019t say I started feeling comfortable from day 1. On the day of our first appointment she had to attend to an emergency delivery in Koramangala clinic and she had to rush. She couldn\u2019t spend too much time. I started thinking how can a patient develop comfort with her doc with just one meeting a month which lasts for not more than 10 or 15 minutes. But in the subsequent appointments I realized that she does give time to patient to ask questions, clarify any kind of doubts even if they are silly. She sticks to basics - healthy food and exercise and active life, doesn\u2019t prescribe unnecessary tests or medicines. She suggested me to continue with my work life as it was before my pregnancy without scaring me anytime due to my bleeding in early pregnancy. During my appointment in the 8th month she said \u201cVery high chances of normal delivery\u201d and we were really excited and little nervous also.. On the D day, we went to the hospital and I delivered under her supervision after almost 20+ hours of labour, which today is one of the most cherished and memorable experiences of my life.\n\nIf you are cooperative and realistic in your expectations you can expect the same from her. For e.g. \u2013 She runs around 2 clinics and sometimes she could be delayed due to delayed delivery or some complications and she is a human. You cannot expect her to reach your clinic on your appointment time.. \n\nPS \u2013 This is a feedback for Dr Poornima and not Apollo Cradle, Jayanagar, where I delivered.",

One knows, pregnancy, delivery and post partum can go either way. But I strongly believe when in good hands of a doctor who is so thorough and patient and helps with a smooth labour, one can only be left with a profound and meaningful birthing experience. Have been recommending Dr.Poornima to all my friends and family circle because of having had such a great experience after consulting her. No unnecessary scans, she is thorough and precise with her diagnosis and instructions. I delivered my baby in Feb 2021 in the hands of Dr.Poornima Ramakrishna and her able team at Apollo Cradle. Was induced to go into labour as I had dilated few cms but wasn't getting natural contractions, post which delivered vaginally without any tear and gentle suturing. She even called my husband into labour room for support and a very dramatic cheer and push required during delivery. My husband and I still cherish when we think of those moments. No looking back for any other gynaecologist after having met Dr.Poornima Ramakrishna. Highly highly recommended. ",

I found her to be empathetic and sensible, taking the time to review my medical history in detail. Although I am not qualified to comment on her diagnosis, she explained to me well my concerns related to the last mishap, my current reports, AMH levels, and so on -- in a way that was easy for me to understand. She not only maintained a positive demeanour throughout our interaction, but she kind of also took responsibility for my well-being, in contrast to my previous doctor, Dr Tyagi, who was competent but not particularly invested in my care. Dr Ramakrishna took a more personal interest in my well-being, and I think will be continuing my upcoming sessions with her.",

My wife had not so good first time pregnancy, so in second time i was more worried and looking for doctor who justified the phrase doctors are equivalent to god.\n\n\nAnd my wife is delighted after meeting her and she knows our babys in safe hand.\nSecond month is going on will update further later.\n\nNow planning to take the package as doctors presence delight me and my wife .And it gives  a great confidence.\n\nI am updating the review due to the kind of love she has provided during pregnancy. During 2nd trimester my wife diagnosed  with dengu. And i had no other option to rush dr Poornima to save baby and mother. And after seeing my wife's condition she had taken full responsibility. And adviced hospital staff for full attention. And she used to visit twice to see the improvement with the treatment. And i came to know that my baby is in safe hand. \n\nAnd during third trimester ,my wife diagnosed with diabetes. Firstly she convinced my wife that nothing can harm you. And she started giving full attention to my wife in every visit. And slowly with proper examination we progressed to the 9th month of pregnancy  . As we were having bad past with normal delivery .We asked doctor for c section. Then she explained us the pros and cons of normal delivery and c section. She clearly told us as normal delivery has various advantage ,i cant ignore it. But she had given us faith that ,in any emergency we will plan for c section. So on the delivery day, due to water leakage we got admitted early .As it was indication of normal delivery pain ,we got admitted early.And we waited for 4 hours for pain to increase as water loss was more and chances of something serious damage was there. As confirmed earlier by the doctor , she would act according to patient conditon. And she  decided for c section. And she has already arranged all experts from hospital as precautions due to past history. And the operation was successful .And she came back with smiley face to inform us the successful delivery of baby.\n\nAnd i am writing all this to show my gratitude for her. She cared us like her own child from the beginning till end.",

We started consulting doctor from the third month of our pregnancy. We were in confusion whether to continue the old doctor or should we consult Dr Poornima. In this dilemma our 3rd month scan got delayed by 2 days. AfTer so much thinking we opted for Dr Poornima. Our first visit she saw our last doctor\u2019s case sheet. And asked our 3rd month scan details, we said we are planing to do it here with you. Doc scolded my wife like anything, literally she made my wife cry. Then she explained both of us how important to do the scans on the exact dates, in particularly the 3rd month scan. I asked my wife due to want continue with this doctor. My wife said I want this Doctor only. After that everything was spl. We enjoyed our parenthood thoroughly. Doctors explains everything. We asked for normal delivery. Doctor supported us so much. My wife was 32 at that time pregnancy and it\u2019s our first baby. Dr Poornima is a strong personality, very strict and informative. If you trust her fully I tell you she will keep up the word what she tells you. No matter what. In the last month doctor gave her personal Whatsapp number too, to be in touch and to answer our doubts. On the delivery day, We went through more than 20 hours of labour. She was monitoring my wife through out the day. My wife couldn\u2019t meet the 10cm opening on the delivery day, doctor being so patiently  waited and waited. If it\u2019s any other doctor they would have performed the C section. Then finally she performed normal delivery to my wife. My baby boy weighted 3.8kg, both mother and baby was healthy. I still remember what doctor said after coming out from the OT Big Baby, and my wife is a strong woman. I should tell you one thing our baby birth happened during the first wave of covid. She has been like a family member when we are in hospital. Once you go to her, trust her fully. You may find her very strict. *** *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** True Doctor. ",

What initially seemed like a high risk pregnancy (I was on bed rest for first 3 months due to bleeding) turned out to be a wonderful experience for me with a normal delivery. The reason I decided to consult her is because of her reputation in normal deliveries.\n \nI wouldn\u2019t say I started feeling comfortable from day 1. On the day of our first appointment she had to attend to an emergency delivery in Koramangala clinic and she had to rush. She couldn\u2019t spend too much time. I started thinking how can a patient develop comfort with her doc with just one meeting a month which lasts for not more than 10 or 15 minutes. But in the subsequent appointments I realized that she does give time to patient to ask questions, clarify any kind of doubts even if they are silly. She sticks to basics - healthy food and exercise and active life, doesn\u2019t prescribe unnecessary tests or medicines. She suggested me to continue with my work life as it was before my pregnancy without scaring me anytime due to my bleeding in early pregnancy. During my appointment in the 8th month she said \u201cVery high chances of normal delivery\u201d and we were really excited and little nervous also.. On the D day, we went to the hospital and I delivered under her supervision after almost 20+ hours of labour, which today is one of the most cherished and memorable experiences of my life.\n\nIf you are cooperative and realistic in your expectations you can expect the same from her. For e.g. \u2013 She runs around 2 clinics and sometimes she could be delayed due to delayed delivery or some complications and she is a human. You cannot expect her to reach your clinic on your appointment time.. \n\nPS \u2013 This is a feedback for Dr Poornima and not Apollo Cradle, Jayanagar, where I delivered.",

One knows, pregnancy, delivery and post partum can go either way. But I strongly believe when in good hands of a doctor who is so thorough and patient and helps with a smooth labour, one can only be left with a profound and meaningful birthing experience. Have been recommending Dr.Poornima to all my friends and family circle because of having had such a great experience after consulting her. No unnecessary scans, she is thorough and precise with her diagnosis and instructions. I delivered my baby in Feb 2021 in the hands of Dr.Poornima Ramakrishna and her able team at Apollo Cradle. Was induced to go into labour as I had dilated few cms but wasn't getting natural contractions, post which delivered vaginally without any tear and gentle suturing. She even called my husband into labour room for support and a very dramatic cheer and push required during delivery. My husband and I still cherish when we think of those moments. No looking back for any other gynaecologist after having met Dr.Poornima Ramakrishna. Highly highly recommended. ",

I found her to be empathetic and sensible, taking the time to review my medical history in detail. Although I am not qualified to comment on her diagnosis, she explained to me well my concerns related to the last mishap, my current reports, AMH levels, and so on -- in a way that was easy for me to understand. She not only maintained a positive demeanour throughout our interaction, but she kind of also took responsibility for my well-being, in contrast to my previous doctor, Dr Tyagi, who was competent but not particularly invested in my care. Dr Ramakrishna took a more personal interest in my well-being, and I think will be continuing my upcoming sessions with her.",

After being married for 6 years and 1 year of unsuccessful infertility treatment, at the verge of opting IVF, I met Dr.Poornima through my neighbour. 3 months into treatment, I got conceived. she was my confidence booster. no unnecessary scans, not much medicines prescribed, only healthy food and a healthy and active lifestyle. Highly recommends normal delivery. Now I have a 15 month old baby girl delivered normally. Thank you so much Mam.! You are our angel!",

She keeps track of her clients in her Tab.  A doctor of her stature doesn't even need to do this. She explained and advised every minute detail during my pregnancy with so much patience and kept me comfortable and confident all time. And finally when the delivery time approached, she insisted me on normal deliver since I have a chances of having normal delivery. Also she waited all day in the hospital to make this happen, that too over a weekend.. Thanks Dr.Poornima for making this happened to me. Thanks Apollo Cradle Kormangala staff.",
