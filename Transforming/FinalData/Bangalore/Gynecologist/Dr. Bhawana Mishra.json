I met Dr. Bhawana Mishra upon one of our friend\u2019s suggestion and I\u2019m very pleased with my choice to have her as my Gynecologist.\nShe is one of the most professional Doctors I\u2019ve ever met. What differentiates her from others is her emotional capabilities. \nAfter two miscarriages and difficulty in conceiving we had lost all the hopes. She gave us a ray of hope and guided me with invaluable suggestions which helped me to conceive and have a smooth delivery. It would have not been possible without her guidance. My pregnancy was a complicated one, but she was there for me all the times like a mother, very caring and compassionate. She always took time to listen to my health needs and answered all my questions (even silly doubts\uf04a). Few qualities of her which I really want to appreciate and accentuate are:\n\u2022\tProfessionalism- Exceptionally good in her field *** ********* ***** ********* ** ********* ****** ** ***********\u2022\tEmpathy \u2013 Which is rare to see these days. A great listener and genuinely concerned about her patient\u2019s well-being. You can share all your doubts and fear without any hesitation.\n\u2022\tAvailability \u2013 She makes sure that you can get in touch with her when needed (you can text her when facing any issue and will surely get reply from her). \n\u2022\tShe always tries to avoid unnecessary medicines.\n\nIcing on the cake was clinic staffs, very polite and helpful. I can say this was the best experience I have had in a clinic.\n\nMam we are so fortunate to find you. Thank you for all your help and for not giving up on me! I really appreciate it! Thank you!!",

Reading the glowing reviews gave us hope that this Dr could just be the one. From the get go Dr Bhawana was like a breath of fresh air , with her calm demeanor and beaming smile . I felt comfortable and confident in her  . She calmed my fears , addressed all my concerns and cleared my doubts without rushing through the appointment . My pregnancy was anything but painless  , I had different symptoms almost every week and Dr Bhawana treated me with utmost patience and care . Whenever I had any uncomfortable symptoms I would msg her and she would reply in a jiffy. Her medicines would always work like magic for me and she made my pregnancy journey as comfortable as possible . During my delivery she came back from her vacation and performed my C section . Seeing her at the operation theatre I knew I was in good hands and my C section couldn't have gone smoother , it was over before I even knew it . I've never met a doctor who is a perfect combination of patient and professional with a  profound love for her patients. I will definitely miss my monthly appointments with Dr Bhawana and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for an Ob-gyn.",

And top it all how can I forget that beautiful smile of hers , brings you peace. She was available anytime we needed her.

I met Dr. Bhawana Mishra upon one of our friend\u2019s suggestion and I\u2019m very pleased with my choice to have her as my Gynecologist.\nShe is one of the most professional Doctors I\u2019ve ever met. What differentiates her from others is her emotional capabilities. \nAfter two miscarriages and difficulty in conceiving we had lost all the hopes. She gave us a ray of hope and guided me with invaluable suggestions which helped me to conceive and have a smooth delivery. It would have not been possible without her guidance. My pregnancy was a complicated one, but she was there for me all the times like a mother, very caring and compassionate. She always took time to listen to my health needs and answered all my questions (even silly doubts\uf04a). Few qualities of her which I really want to appreciate and accentuate are:\n\u2022\tProfessionalism- Exceptionally good in her field *** ********* ***** ********* ** ********* ****** ** ***********\u2022\tEmpathy \u2013 Which is rare to see these days. A great listener and genuinely concerned about her patient\u2019s well-being. You can share all your doubts and fear without any hesitation.\n\u2022\tAvailability \u2013 She makes sure that you can get in touch with her when needed (you can text her when facing any issue and will surely get reply from her). \n\u2022\tShe always tries to avoid unnecessary medicines.\n\nIcing on the cake was clinic staffs, very polite and helpful. I can say this was the best experience I have had in a clinic.\n\nMam we are so fortunate to find you. Thank you for all your help and for not giving up on me! I really appreciate it! Thank you!!",

Reading the glowing reviews gave us hope that this Dr could just be the one. From the get go Dr Bhawana was like a breath of fresh air , with her calm demeanor and beaming smile . I felt comfortable and confident in her  . She calmed my fears , addressed all my concerns and cleared my doubts without rushing through the appointment . My pregnancy was anything but painless  , I had different symptoms almost every week and Dr Bhawana treated me with utmost patience and care . Whenever I had any uncomfortable symptoms I would msg her and she would reply in a jiffy. Her medicines would always work like magic for me and she made my pregnancy journey as comfortable as possible . During my delivery she came back from her vacation and performed my C section . Seeing her at the operation theatre I knew I was in good hands and my C section couldn't have gone smoother , it was over before I even knew it . I've never met a doctor who is a perfect combination of patient and professional with a  profound love for her patients. I will definitely miss my monthly appointments with Dr Bhawana and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for an Ob-gyn.",

I have such beautiful memories the way she would explain everything and give examples of her pregnancy and her family members. And top it all how can I forget that beautiful smile of hers , brings you peace. She was available anytime we needed her. I never really said enough of thank you to her to make my pregnancy journey so beautiful. Would like to use this platform to do so , Heart felt thank you Doctor. You are a blessing.
