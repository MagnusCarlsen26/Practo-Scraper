The way she had diagnosed my problem and treated it with smile I was very satisfied with it and later when I had conceived i visited her for my pregnancy and to describe her brilliance in handling my case it\u2019s just awesome... I am a type of person who gets nervous very easily. And on my each and every visit she had calmed me down and gave me confidence and cleared all my doubts patiently. On the duration of entire 9 months she has kept her treatment smooth and with precaution so that nothing goes wrong. What will you call her when at the time of delivery she had hugged me to calm me down and delivered a beautiful baby girl \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 she is a fantastic doctor and I would Recommend her to all with the rating of 5*.... and to be honest I don\u2019t have enough words to describe her... she is just an amazing human being and an excellent gynaecologist...

When everything failed, I came across Dr. Joshita Naik on Google and the reviews were very promising. When we met her the first time, we felt like we are meeting Dhanvantari. She was calm, no hurries, went through everything in the reports and understood our problems and within few months, there was immense happiness at our home and hearts. Next month we are expecting the baby and the only thing we say about Dr. Joshita Naik is THE GODESS in disguise. Thanks so much Doctor ",

And 30 min the next time (to show the previous reports. She suggested a few more tests which I got done and went back the third time). The third time, my appointment was canceled and shifted to the next day. When I turned up the next day (after a prior call) I had to wait 1 hr 25 min before i was told by the receptionist Sonia - \"you can wait if you want to see the doctor. if not, you may leave\".\n\nNever again visiting Apollo Cradle. By far the worst.\n\nWhile all this was going on - I enquired if i can get the ultrasound done. they agreed. After waiting for over 45 min for the scan, the doctor simply walked off. \n\nThis hospital does not care about people's time or health! God save those who go here for their pregnancies.",

I am a type of person who gets nervous very easily. And on my each and every visit she had calmed me down and gave me confidence and cleared all my doubts patiently. On the duration of entire 9 months she has kept her treatment smooth and with precaution so that nothing goes wrong. What will you call her when at the time of delivery she had hugged me to calm me down and delivered a beautiful baby girl \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 she is a fantastic doctor and I would Recommend her to all with the rating of 5*.... and to be honest I don\u2019t have enough words to describe her... she is just an amazing human being and an excellent gynaecologist...

She was calm, no hurries, went through everything in the reports and understood our problems and within few months, there was immense happiness at our home and hearts. Next month we are expecting the baby and the only thing we say about Dr. Joshita Naik is THE GODESS in disguise. Thanks so much Doctor ",

The third time, my appointment was canceled and shifted to the next day. When I turned up the next day (after a prior call) I had to wait 1 hr 25 min before i was told by the receptionist Sonia - \"you can wait if you want to see the doctor. if not, you may leave\".\n\nNever again visiting Apollo Cradle. By far the worst.\n\nWhile all this was going on - I enquired if i can get the ultrasound done. they agreed. After waiting for over 45 min for the scan, the doctor simply walked off. \n\nThis hospital does not care about people's time or health! God save those who go here for their pregnancies.",
