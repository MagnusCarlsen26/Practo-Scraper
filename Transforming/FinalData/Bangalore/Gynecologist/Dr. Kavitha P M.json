On calling Cloudnine Jayanagar branch I was given appointment with Dr. Kavitha PM , I checked couple of positive reviews and met this Doctor and got to know that I am pregnant. Initially she was very positive and friendly and assisted me as I had extreme nausea. Eventually whenever I would ask the doctor about the probability of normal delivery I was not given any positive answer and told that we will tell you when you need to get admitted as I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes which was very mild and controlled after I was referred to the specialist who monitored my case closely and told that it is controlled and I need not worry . I had my growth scan during 32nd week where I was told that baby's weight is less and I might have to do another scan soon, deliver early and keep the baby in NICU. I was extremely worried hearing this as I am quite healthy otherwise and baby's activity in womb was also good. I wasn't convinced with whatever she told hence I sent my reports to my family doctor in my hometown.* *** *** *** ******* *** **** **** ***** ** ** ****** **** ****** ****** *** ** ******** ** ******* *** **** ** ***** I wanted to change the hospital as well as doctor as the hospital was very unprofessional during pandemic *** ****** *** **** ********* Due to Covid 19 only the patient was allowed to see the doctor hence my husband wasn't allowed to meet the doctor. She was very negative in the end and didn't have any empathy towards a pregnant women. ** ****** ****** **** ** **** * ******** *** *** ****** *** *** ******** I changed the hospital as well as doctor *** ********* *** ***** ******* ** ****** ****** ** *** ** ** ******** ********* ******** ** *** ***** ** ******* ** *** ************* It was perhaps the best decision I took ** *** *** **** ******** *** ****** ***** ** ** **** *** **** *** ** ******* **** ********* ******** * *** * **** **** ********* *** ********* * ******* **** *** ******** ** **** **** ** ****** ****** ***** *** ***** ******** ***** *** ***** *** **** ************ ** ***** *** ****** ******** **** ** ******** ***** *** ******* ** *** ******** Please be very mindful before choosing Cloudnine or Dr. Kavitha ** **** **** ** **** **** ********* ******** *** ******* **** ****** ** ********* ******* *** ******* I don't recommend this Doctor and this hospital at all.

On calling Cloudnine Jayanagar branch I was given appointment with Dr. Kavitha PM , I checked couple of positive reviews and met this Doctor and got to know that I am pregnant. Initially she was very positive and friendly and assisted me as I had extreme nausea. Eventually whenever I would ask the doctor about the probability of normal delivery I was not given any positive answer and told that we will tell you when you need to get admitted as I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes which was very mild and controlled after I was referred to the specialist who monitored my case closely and told that it is controlled and I need not worry . I had my growth scan during 32nd week where I was told that baby's weight is less and I might have to do another scan soon, deliver early and keep the baby in NICU. I was extremely worried hearing this as I am quite healthy otherwise and baby's activity in womb was also good. I wasn't convinced with whatever she told hence I sent my reports to my family doctor in my hometown.* *** *** *** ******* *** **** **** ***** ** ** ****** **** ****** ****** *** ** ******** ** ******* *** **** ** ***** I wanted to change the hospital as well as doctor as the hospital was very unprofessional during pandemic *** ****** *** **** ********* Due to Covid 19 only the patient was allowed to see the doctor hence my husband wasn't allowed to meet the doctor. She was very negative in the end and didn't have any empathy towards a pregnant women. ** ****** ****** **** ** **** * ******** *** *** ****** *** *** ******** I changed the hospital as well as doctor *** ********* *** ***** ******* ** ****** ****** ** *** ** ** ******** ********* ******** ** *** ***** ** ******* ** *** ************* It was perhaps the best decision I took ** *** *** **** ******** *** ****** ***** ** ** **** *** **** *** ** ******* **** ********* ******** * *** * **** **** ********* *** ********* * ******* **** *** ******** ** **** **** ** ****** ****** ***** *** ***** ******** ***** *** ***** *** **** ************ ** ***** *** ****** ******** **** ** ******** ***** *** ******* ** *** ******** Please be very mindful before choosing Cloudnine or Dr. Kavitha ** **** **** ** **** **** ********* ******** *** ******* **** ****** ** ********* ******* *** ******* I don't recommend this Doctor and this hospital at all.
