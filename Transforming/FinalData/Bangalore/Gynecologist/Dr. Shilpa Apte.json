We had an ectopic pregnancy which Dr. Apte successfully managed medically with no complications. A few months later, we got pregnant and throughout the pregnancy, Dr. Apte was very particular about consistent testing for both the mother and child to ensure the pregnancy is progressing well. After going for induced labor and not seeing enough progress, we opted for C-Section. Dr. Apte was prompt and made herself available right away and helped deliver our wonderful baby girl. I would highly recommend Dr. Apte for any OBGYN related issues/concerns/consultation.",

Every doctor we met apart from Shilpa had few issues which we didn't like or we didn't feel comfortable. After meeting Dr. Shilpa it was immediately decided by us that she will deliver our baby and she did.\nWe are so happy that we could find a doctor who understood us well, and helped us go through first pregnancy like a walk in a park. I thank you with all my heart. \nI recommend visiting her once before finalizing the doctor for you.\nShe doesn't rush you, listens you well, provides solutions to treat causes instead of symptoms. You can ask her all type of silly questions, she will reply you with a smile. Also, be happy with you when your baby moves in the tummy.\n:)",

We visited 4 doctors before finally deciding on the doctor to take care of my wife during pregnancy. Every doctor we met apart from Shilpa had few issues which we didn't like or we didn't feel comfortable. After meeting Dr. Shilpa it was immediately decided by us that she will deliver our baby and she did.\nWe are so happy that we could find a doctor who understood us well, and helped us go through first pregnancy like a walk in a park. I thank you with all my heart. \nI recommend visiting her once before finalizing the doctor for you.\nShe doesn't rush you, listens you well, provides solutions to treat causes instead of symptoms. You can ask her all type of silly questions, she will reply you with a smile. Also, be happy with you when your baby moves in the tummy.\n:)",
