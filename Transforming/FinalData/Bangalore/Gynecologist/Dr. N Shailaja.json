She explained well, ** *********** ***** **** ***** Gave follic acid and within 3 months I was pregnant. No further visit was required.\nOnce pregnancy got confirmed, for all my prenatal checkups, I continued there. She fills a lot of confidence in patient, and is excellent. Minimal but best suppliments were given. Diet was adviced to make pregnancy smooth. It is hard to find such doctors.\n\n\u00a0I had small csp in my anamoly scan. I was scared. She explained things so well and thankfully all was fine by the time of repeat scan. Doctor directly came to clinic after coming from hospital just as we were waiting, though it was a festival day. The environment in the clinic itself is positive.\n\nInitially I did not feel the doctor much friendly but later when I got covid, and was scared, in this situation as well she adviced some vitamins and said, be confident, and that words were so promising and she filled that strength to fight covid, being a friend. \n\nShe suggested prenatal yoga, which also played a major role in my pregnancy. \n\nThanks to all the care and strength given to me by you mam.\n\nI would say, unfortunately I had to shift my hospital as I had to shift to my parents place considering this is my first pregnancy and could not continue here for delivery. But there can be no other concern for you once you approach her.\n\nI would surely recommend her to everyone.. Also if I would plan a second one, sure I would go only to her. You are in safe hands if you have visited here.\n\nThanks again mam, for giving so much hope and strength and finally for giving us a beautiful baby girl. We have no words, and grateful tht we found such a good doctor. ",

I had visited her from the 6th month of my second pregnancy of recommendation of my neighbour nurse at the rainbow hospital. (I regret for not having known about her in my first pregnancy and earlier of second pregnancy).Being used to regular check ups with innumerable machines in gyneac hospitals, I was startled by her expertise to know the baby development without a machine. Just one scan towards end weeks and regular fetal heart rate check. Minimal medication and tests prescribed. Emphasis on diet and exercise only. During labour, with a touch she knew whether I had contractions and she was spot on. After a hectic day, she was still at the hospital until 4 am to welcome our angel to this world safe. I was amazed to see her concentration and care during the last few moments of my delivery. my post delivery recovery too was quick.hardly a week while I suffered for a month due to the stitches in my first pregnancy elsewhere. I do recommend her and request every visitor to place ur trust in her and can with confidence say she will stay by it.\n\nNow about the few comments on wait time and related... Pregnancy is not a defined treatment unlike other diseases. Few moments can change all plans unexpectedly. You will realise the importance of being given preference when u r in pain or have uncertainty of the well being of self and the foetus. At such points, u wish others let u go and meet the doc first. After my delivery, she would have reached home only by 5am on a Sunday and she was back at the hospital by 10 am to visit me again. In 5hours, kindly think of how much sleep and rest she would have received, how much of her personal life she did  get. And please bear in mind, it's a routine for them and not a one of weekend that this happens. She too is a mother, wife, daughter and most importantly deserve a  \"me time\" to rejuvenate herself. Doctors who dedicate themselves like her for the well being deserve much support and appreciation from the society. If ppl donot want to spare a thought about them, plz don't hurt them..it's a social and moral responsibility to stand by them...\n\nI sincerely pray for a long life for you so that many more healthy babies see this world safe. Thank you is just a confined word and hence not using it\ud83d\ude0a",

She explained well, ** *********** ***** **** ***** Gave follic acid and within 3 months I was pregnant. No further visit was required.\nOnce pregnancy got confirmed, for all my prenatal checkups, I continued there. She fills a lot of confidence in patient, and is excellent. Minimal but best suppliments were given. Diet was adviced to make pregnancy smooth. It is hard to find such doctors.\n\n\u00a0I had small csp in my anamoly scan. I was scared. She explained things so well and thankfully all was fine by the time of repeat scan. Doctor directly came to clinic after coming from hospital just as we were waiting, though it was a festival day. The environment in the clinic itself is positive.\n\nInitially I did not feel the doctor much friendly but later when I got covid, and was scared, in this situation as well she adviced some vitamins and said, be confident, and that words were so promising and she filled that strength to fight covid, being a friend. \n\nShe suggested prenatal yoga, which also played a major role in my pregnancy. \n\nThanks to all the care and strength given to me by you mam.\n\nI would say, unfortunately I had to shift my hospital as I had to shift to my parents place considering this is my first pregnancy and could not continue here for delivery. But there can be no other concern for you once you approach her.\n\nI would surely recommend her to everyone.. Also if I would plan a second one, sure I would go only to her. You are in safe hands if you have visited here.\n\nThanks again mam, for giving so much hope and strength and finally for giving us a beautiful baby girl. We have no words, and grateful tht we found such a good doctor. ",

I had visited her from the 6th month of my second pregnancy of recommendation of my neighbour nurse at the rainbow hospital. (I regret for not having known about her in my first pregnancy and earlier of second pregnancy).Being used to regular check ups with innumerable machines in gyneac hospitals, I was startled by her expertise to know the baby development without a machine. Just one scan towards end weeks and regular fetal heart rate check. Minimal medication and tests prescribed. Emphasis on diet and exercise only. During labour, with a touch she knew whether I had contractions and she was spot on. After a hectic day, she was still at the hospital until 4 am to welcome our angel to this world safe. I was amazed to see her concentration and care during the last few moments of my delivery. my post delivery recovery too was quick.hardly a week while I suffered for a month due to the stitches in my first pregnancy elsewhere. I do recommend her and request every visitor to place ur trust in her and can with confidence say she will stay by it.\n\nNow about the few comments on wait time and related... Pregnancy is not a defined treatment unlike other diseases. Few moments can change all plans unexpectedly. You will realise the importance of being given preference when u r in pain or have uncertainty of the well being of self and the foetus. At such points, u wish others let u go and meet the doc first. After my delivery, she would have reached home only by 5am on a Sunday and she was back at the hospital by 10 am to visit me again. In 5hours, kindly think of how much sleep and rest she would have received, how much of her personal life she did  get. And please bear in mind, it's a routine for them and not a one of weekend that this happens. She too is a mother, wife, daughter and most importantly deserve a  \"me time\" to rejuvenate herself. Doctors who dedicate themselves like her for the well being deserve much support and appreciation from the society. If ppl donot want to spare a thought about them, plz don't hurt them..it's a social and moral responsibility to stand by them...\n\nI sincerely pray for a long life for you so that many more healthy babies see this world safe. Thank you is just a confined word and hence not using it\ud83d\ude0a",

After reading reviews about lot of doctors online, thanks to Practo's recommendation and all 5 star feedback, that I decided to try Dr. Shailaja once during my 2nd pregnancy. That's it! \nAfter my 1st meeting with her, it was no looking back and no more doctor hunts. She was just perfect in every sense. \nNormally we are v anxious on visits to doctors these days. Here I was, looking forward for my next appointments. I could share everything with the doctor, be it a concern, a trivial question or a detailed medico technical discussion. She is v practical and not even once restricted me from travelling, flying, driving (till full term), eating or any other physical activity. ( mine being  no risk pregnancy) \nThe best thing about her is her cool and calmness even if there is emergency situation or if things  are not going in the right direction.  This positive  friendly attitude itself  will turn things around and gives strength and confidence for patients. \nShe is extremely knowledgeable and up to date with latest research, being the gold medallist she is. \n\nI thank Dr. Shailaja from the bottom of my heart for making my pregnancy and delivery an enjoyable journey  and wish many ladies benefit from her in the years to come.

After a lot of research we got to know about Dr. Shailaja and since there is no turning back. She is very jolly and explains everything in details with a smiling face, her treatment had been just outstanding and there had been no issues till date, she always tries for a normal delivery instead of patients insisting her which is very rear. With her superb support and treatment we were blessed with a baby boy without any issues.The clinic is a one stop solution which has scan and blood test facilities so that patients don't have to run multiple places and all the staffs are very co-operative and nice. We wholeheartedly recommend Dr  to each and everyone who is reading my review here. Thanks for the patient reading!!",

Everytime I ran to her in fear and doubt she or her assistant Dr Gayathri would handle me very patiently and fill me with hope.\nOnce when I had bleeding in pregnancy I went running to her. She was heading to the labor room. She advised scan. By the time she came out it was past her duty time in the hospital. She could have just headed home and asked me to see her in the clinic.Yet  after the labor duty she directly walked into the scanning room to check my status. \nShe constantly had advised me to stay positive and active and was more eager than me for a normal delivery. Even though my AFI was low she stayed confident and helped me deliver my baby normally.\nI have seen many patients going into the consultation room tensed or crying and walk out beaming. That\u2019s the power of her positivity. It\u2019s infectious and fills the patient with hope and energy.\nMany people have complained here about waiting time in her clinic but they have to understand the nature of her profession. Its full of unexpected emergencies. Her profession is such that she many not get a full night\u2019s sleep at a stretch. I have seen her keep her family waiting because she had to attend to patients first. Please think about the sacrifice doctors like her make, before complaining about waiting time.",

We reached at 2.50PM, doctor suppose to come at 3PM, but she came at 3.35PM, but as per my understanding she was in first floor only, simply they do't care about others\u2019 time. My number was at 5th, they started sending patients to the doctor's room, they sent 8-9 patients, then I questioned mine appointment is at 5th, why you are not allowing me to meet doctor. One lady told me doctor is busy in other cases, they think your case is not important. Then that lady said before going to doctor I need to tell her about patient history records and all, it was just to convince me, she only asked patient name, age etc, it was just for name sake. It was 4.40 PM and we were told we still need to wait since there are few more important cases. They behave like this is the only place where we can go for consult in Bangalore, no value for others\u2019 time, unprofessional behaviour. We left the place without consulting. I know for them does not matter whether one patient is coming or not, but I wanted to save others\u2019 time, if I am able to save one patient\u2019s time by writing this review by job is done.",

She asked me to get two tests done, without unnecessarily making the list long. I visited her on Sunday and they have a follow up of policy of 5 days. I got my reports on Wednesday and booked a follow up appointment with her for Friday at morning 8:30 am. They re-scheduled the appointment on the same day for 10:30 due to some emergency at their end. I am a working person and it was not possible for me to visit the doctor at 10:30 am as I had an important meeting which couldn't be cancelled/ postponed at the end moment. So I requested the staff to please connect me to the doctor over the call at the same time, as it was only a follow up visit and I just wanted her opinion on my reports but they denied. Had there been some issue with the report, I would have taken another appointment to visit her. I do not understand what is the harm of connecting the patient with the doctor over the call at the re-scheduled time, when it is simply a follow up visit and that discussion would hardly take 5 minutes. But they did not agree, they said we don't do that. I requested and told them that they are the one who re-scheduled the appointment at the end moment, then they said they will check with the doctor and get back to me, which they didn't. I have been following up regularly with them but they are just not ready to connect me with the doctor. \nMy follow up time is also expired and now why shall I pay Rs 600 again to just get my reports checked, which was a part of the follow up process, which they re-scheduled at the end moment and then even after so much of request, didn't connect me to the doctor. I am still calling them, but they are just not supportive and helpful.\nI want to go ahead with the doctor for my treatment as she, in person, is a good doctor in explaining health issues but if this is how the hospital behavior is, I would definitely not go ahead with it. As they don't let the patient talk to doctor **** ****** ** ***** ****** **** ** ******** ****** Or I don't know if that's Doctor's call.\nI am still waiting for the hospital t get back to me.",

Shaylaja who is the doctor at this clinic has got great recommendations and reviews, which made me choose her. ************** *** *** **** ******* *** ** ****** ******* *** ********** ** ** ***** ****** From day one I had been going to the clinic, thru all my scans and check ups where in it was her assistants doing her job, she would not even read the reports properly and just say everything looks normal and good, which made my husband and me confidant for a normal birth. She never made an effort to connect with me and explain the process of birth or even discuss a birth plan with me. In my last scan is when she said we might have to go for a c section even though my placenta was 3.7cm above. When I told her I want a normal birth she said \"you can try\". \nNow coming to the day of the delivery. I was admitted in rainbow hospita***** ** ************* ***** ******* at 8:30am. She never came once to see me. It was only in the last moment at 11:20 PM after giving me an epidural that she called and said prepare yourself and your family for a c section* *** *** * *** *** *** **** ** ********* *** *** ** *** *** ** ***** *** ********** ***** ** ** *** *** ****** ****** *** I could feel every single thing done to me in the OT.

I gained positive experiences with her during my pregnancy journey.I highly recommend her to everybody dreaming of a child. *** ** *** **** ****** ** *** ** ******** She gives complete attention to the patients. She smilingly solves the problem and helps to get rid of negativities and helps to escape out of all concerns and fears. I suffered two miscarriages earlier and other doctors suggested me to take heparin injection daily up to 9 months in order to reduce the risk of miscarriage again..But Alhamdulillah God gifted me a ray of hope as Dr Shailaja, she made my pregnancy safe n sound without going on heparin and Most important point I should mention is She supports Vaginal delivery as much as she can. By the kind eyes of God I am blessed with a baby boy with great support of Dr Shailaja . I am highly obliged to her.\nThank you.",

Through out the course of pregnancy, she suggested the right scans, investigations and prescribed the right medications for the well being of mother and baby. Towards 35 weeks, my wife had severe lower back pain (non labor pain), but Doctor kept calm and stressed upon good walking and good food habits that ensured normal delivery. One of the most important things during a pregnancy is a Doctor who has not just the expertise, but makes you feel comfortable and friendly. After being admitted to the hospital my wife gave up in 10 hours and insisted c section, however Doctor Shailaja motivated my wife and asked her to bear the pain for some more hours. Doctor stayed back in the hospital in the night , waited patiently and delivered the baby at 2am. It would have been a easier task for the Doctor to perform C Section, but with God\u2019s grace and Doctor\u2019s support it ended up as normal delivery. Kudos to such Doctors who work tirelessly for the benefit of mothers and babies. Highly recommend Dr.Shailaja. ",

There were multiple times as a patent when I tend to give up, but she has always given me hope and the best treatment. I have visited other doctors prior to this who have not diagnosed the issue but were giving me interim medication and this was for years. Dr Shailaja in short span of time identified the problem which others couldnt.  Whilst I continue my treatment with her, I sure do recommend her.",

The smile on her face, her energy level & and the patience with which she listened to all our stupid little questions was very comforting. Not at one point did we feel that she is disinterested in what we had to say or ask. She talked to us about every small little detail. Very very very satisfied with our conversation with her & would highly recommend her expertise\u200b , especially to first time parents ( to be). ",

She took care of me for last 5 months of my pregnancy. She is very friendly. She was available to me all the time Even on whatsapp and calls and she used to answer my queries on phone also. Wait time for her appointment is very less. I was hypertension patient with problem of urine protein. She was observing my protein level and blood pressure regularly. Doctor was very positive about normal delivery. She never asked me for C section. On the date of delivery (Diwali midnight), she was available whole night and with her help and her suggestion of epidural, i was able to deliver baby girl very easily. I will never forget her and will be thankful to her always.",

Dr came at 5.45pm and we went in at 5.55pm, checkup and a basic test took 20 mins.\nThen I paid 500rs, 400rs consultation and 100rs as registration but this information was not present at Practo site. After we came back home got call from clinic saying we got missed call from this number, I said yes I called to check on my appointment and you calling me back once I came back, for this he said atleast we called back and you be happy for that!!! Very rude reply from him. \n\nOverall it\u2019s quite disappointed altogether but Dr was friendly and listened our issues, have to see the cure after medication. ",

She always meets you with a warm smile and instills confidence with her words. We are forever indebted to Dr. Shailaja for helping us get our baby girl.

Observed that she gives priority to her patients; always on time - be it at hospital or at her clinic which does help a lot during pregnancy (I'm sure everyone can relate to). At the same time, she ensures to answer all questions patiently and with adequate details. Doesn't beat around the bush, states what exactly is the issue & helps with the best possible solution.. With her guidance my pregnancy journey was smooth, and by baby was delivered healthy without any hurdles. She even maintains a very friendly staff who provides efficient service. Thank you mam (Dr. Shailaja) for everything. ",

She is very soft spoken , explains you well about all the doubts you ask. She never prescribes any additional medicines than the minimal required during the period of your pregnancy. You can call her up anytime and she would be ready to help you through. She never asked for a additional pregnancy scans other than the ones which are very much needed. I had a normal delivery after I followed all the instructions that she gave. \nI would say that you can be 100% sure and relaxed if you being treated by this doctor.",

Even when we had a few complications, she ensured the right treatment is given to us. She is approachable even at odd hours which is really comforting.  I have and will always recommend her to all my friends and family.

Considering risk factors(-ve blood group, First Cesarean, and other factors), she had advised to go for C-Section (around 5-6 days before estimated delivery date). This was also coupled with doctor going out of station during delivery date. Me and my wife took the risk of waiting till the delivery date and looked for alternate doctor. To our good fortune (though it was risky), my wife had normal delivery (of course the new doctor also had experience in handling this kind of risky deliveries as well). I would highly recommend Dr. Sailaja for pregnancy related consultations.",

So, it is precious thing to select a good doctor who encourages natural delivery rather than C-sec.\nI delivered baby boy in the month of October. She\u2019s the best doctor I came across. I have been experienced that Dr. Shailaja madam is providing best maternity services to her patients. I never forget that moment in my life when in 8th month I was diagnosed with obstetric cholesterol. During my delivery time I was very scared whole night she convinced me to have patience so that we can have normal delivery.\nHer clinic is easily approachable, affordable, neat & clean with good staff.\nShe doesn\u2019t give unnecessary medicines. She listens her patients and answer all queries patiently. *** ** *** **** ************ *** ******** ****** **** * **** ********** ***** ******* ***** **** ************, I suggest and advice you can trust her blindly with no 2nd thought.\nOne of the most experienced & sincere doctor I have ever seen, dedicated to her work, given you clear & precise explanation as required.\nThanks, Doctor, for treating us like a family.\n",

She has this smile that puts you at ease instantly. I thought the doctor may give me some advice and send me packing. But she took full history and spent over 20 minutes speaking to me,counseling with patience and answering all questions. 100% recommended, have no second thoughts",

She has an extremely clean clinic, and the staff and associate doctor were friendly and approachable. Our experience with Dr. Shailaja herself was also quite nice. She was kind and patient and took time to listen to us and answered all our questions thoughtfully. She obviously has a method of treatment which surely has worked for her patients, and her experience and expertise felt quite reassuring. She prescribed a change of medication which we we were a bit hesitant about, and we did ask a few counter questions - which she responded to calmly and factually. Overall we had a enlightening experience and will recommend her to anyone without a shadow of doubt.",

Mam was available for every question , doubts via phone or watsapp. Once you visit her you will feel very relaxed and comfort. If you take prior appointment waiting time is very less. The clinic ambiance is very soothing.\nI delivered my baby on Sunday, she came immediately when I was in my active labor irrespective of her holiday. \nIn short I want to say :- She will be with you till the moment you delivery your baby that's for sure. You can blindly trust her. ",
