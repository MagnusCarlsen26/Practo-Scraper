I have visited so many other doctors *** ** *** *** ** *** ***** She has this serene calming effect on you that no matter how or what stress you have it just dissipates in no time. I had a cyst during pregnancy but she was the only one who assured me that I do not have to overthink about it and things would be fine. I delivered during lockdown in April. and she was available even through the last trimester during lockdown via text. I was diagnosed with high BP on last check up and she took all necessary precaution and stayed back late in the hospital until my scan results came to make sure that the baby is doing well too. I delivered a baby boy and he contracted a lung infection and I was extremely low but she gave me the emotional support I needed. Pandemic times did not allow any visitor. But her emotional support helped me a lot. *** ** *** **** ****** ** ********* *** **** *** I would highly recommend and have recommended her to many of my friends. I owe a lot to her for her due diligence and nature. ",
