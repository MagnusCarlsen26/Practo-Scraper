Got my babies delivered through C-section. I have been consulting with Dr.Poornima Murthy, since Day-1 and it has been a wonderful journey so far.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Dr.Poornima Murthy is a very genuine Doctor with a lot of experience. I had my second baby at CloudNine Jayanagar, Normal delivery. She is calm and patient. ******* ********* ******** ************** Tells things frankly and leaves no stone unturned if at all there are any issues. I felt she is quite chilled out and will definitely try for Normal delivery if there are no major risk factors. Would definitely recommend her especially if you want Normal delivery and a smooth pregnancy. Even in the delivery room, I found her calm and cool. She is full of positivity,down to earth, soft spoken and cheerful. Many many thanks to you Dr. Poornima Murthy.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Gynae advice,",0,0,NO,"I had three visits with Dr. Poornima Murthy, and each time was extremely disappointing. 
During the first visit, she seemed more interested in her phone than addressing my concerns, barely speaking to us for more than three minutes. On the second visit, she was in a rush to leave, again on her phone, and spent a mere five minutes with us.
 The final straw was when I had an emergency, and she was nowhere to be found. Instead of providing immediate assistance, she insisted on making an appointment, even though it was clearly urgent.
 Overall, Dr. Murthy's lack of attention, disinterest, and unavailability during crucial times made the entire experience highly unsatisfactory.
I would advice all the people to think twice before visiting her .",2023-06-25 08:05:28,False,False,Rizwana,,,

,"Abortion / Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP),",0,0,NO,I was very clear on what I was asking and none of the questions were directly answered by the doctor. It was all “we’ll see” kind of answers. No direct reply or explanation was given to any of my questions. Additional charges of ₹300 for registration were not mentioned while booking the appointment on Practo. The hospital lab was under maintenance and the reports were to be delayed. The hospital knew this but did not mention anything till they collected the payment. ,2022-05-22 06:09:46,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
