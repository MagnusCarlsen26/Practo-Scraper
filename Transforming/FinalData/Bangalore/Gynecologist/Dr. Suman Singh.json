Even though we insisted for c section because of the pain, Dr Suman advised us for normal delivery and explained the life long benefits behind it. After long 12 hrs of labour pain I was blessed with a baby girl. Me and my family are very happy and thankful to Dr. Suman for the normal delivery. I highly recommend Dr. Suman Singh for all the female related  problems/ pregnancy.",

We had searched for the best gynaecologist around and her name surfaced online with the highest rating and best reviews. Right from the first visit, we were very comfortable with doctor and although I had unfortunately suffered a sudden miscarriage, doctor comforted us explaining how somethings happen naturally and sometimes for our best. After my miscarriage, I did not get my periods naturally for 5 months inspite of all my reports being normal and it worried me big time. But doctor very calmly explained to me that there is nothing to worry and asked me to lose atleast 10 percent of my body weight. She said just try to lose 10 percent of your current weight and you will get your periods. That was exactly what happened when I lost weight as suggested and I could conceive naturally after 3 months. My pregnancy was when covid was at its peak, but it was really nice of doctor Suman to have online consultations with me and I had visited her at the clinic only on my 12th week after I conceived. My pregnancy journey was very smooth thanks to her care and she asked me to register at Rainbow hospital due to which I could avail benefits of attending online classes on Labour pain and delivery, epidural, Breastfeeding and such other topics which were very helpful. In my 32nd week, we realised that my AFI was at border around 10.6 units and having suffered a miscarriage once I was worried. It was very nice of dr. Suman to calm me down saying everything is fine and it instilled a lot of confidence in me. She had asked me to walk as much as possible for normal delivery. My due date was 22nd March,2021 but on 14th March early morning I experienced water leak and was rushed to Rainbow hospital. I was induced around 7.30am and Dr. Suman had spoken to me on call to explain me the procedure and also visited me in my room sometime later. She comforted me saying that my labour is proceeding very well, asked me to take deep breaths and be positive. My delivery although vaccum assisted was very smooth as doctor explained me when and how to push very nicely.She was very supportive and encouraging throughout and helped us deliver healthy baby boy and she also joked saying dekho baby ka weight acha hai all thanks to the aloo bhujia that you ate during pregnancy :) She even played my favourite Om Namah Shivaay song for me and my baby Rudransh in the labour room after delivery :). Although doctor is very strict and professional, she has a very caring and warm side to her, always patiently listening and answering all my questions. I have already recommended her to all my friends and cousins in Bangalore. Thank you Doctor Suman for making my journey to motherhood such a pleasant experience and wishing you happiness and roaring success always :)\n\n- Your patient Vijayalakshmi Viswanathan",

On seeing the doctor she told us to get some tests done and the first scan too, apparently the baby\u2019s heartbeat was not detected and we were tensed to which she calmed us and told to repeat the scan in two weeks which we did and heard our baby\u2019s heartbeat for the first time. \nWith time passing the consultation *** **** *** **** *** **** ********* ** *********** ***** *** **** **** ********** ** *** ******. With every checkup in the last trimester doc advised to walk more and more to increase normal delivery scope and we followed. \nI out of fear was apprehensive about normal delivery and insisted for a c section however Dr Suman unlike other consultants made me relax and told me to be patient and go with the flow and wait for pains and also motivated by saying that since everything is going fine we will not go for section which actually changed my mind. \nDue date was Oct 18 and since pains didn\u2019t come till then, Doctor gave us a detailed session on 16 Oct of the flow of labour induction and how would it go. I got admitted on 17 Oct night 9 Pm and pain was induced and as per doctor\u2019s briefing the hospital duty doctor did the needful and throughout night Dr Suman was on call with the duty doctor on how am I reacting to the pain induction. As per duty doctors I was proceeding well exactly as per the schedule and opening as required. After the morning checkup it was noticed that the baby has passed meconium (first stool) and so we can\u2019t wait for the cervix to open completely for a normal delivery and Dr Suman guided the duty doctor at hospital to prepare for Operation immediately- this was at 8:30 Am and the doctor reached OT in 15 min ready for the surgery which was really amazing - that\u2019s how responsible the doctor is and took the ownership of reaching hospital on time for its patient wherein she could have told other gyanec to proceed with initial setups but she was in the OT even before I reached from 2nd floor of the hospital to 3rd floor. \nThe surgery was smooth n painless with Doctor talking to me and guiding me so nicely just like a family and Thanks to her and hospital team I delivered a cute baby boy. \nI wouldn\u2019t have sat down and written such a detailed feedback unless I mean it and I\u2019m really thankful to Suman ma\u2019am for her right guidance in my pregnancy. \n\nIf she weren't specialized, I'd see her for everything!\u201d\n\nThanks. \nMonika, Pranav, Baby Ansh",

                "review_text": "I waited for 9 months to share my feedback regarding my pregnancy journey with Dr. Suman Singh. \n\nWe are blessed with a baby boy on 27th March and we are overjoyed and extremely happy. It was a wonderful journey with Dr. Suman Singh which is really unforgettable.\n\nShe is extremely helpful, confident, graceful, attractive, down to earth, always listen to your problems carefully, give ample time to treat me and the main thing is she makes you so comfortable that you will just love her accompany. Dr., always gives us courage, a highly motivated person with great physical and mental strength and half of the problems get cured by seeing her. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss my pregnancy journey with Dr. Suman Singh -  \n\nDuring the initial scan, the impression of PCOD (polycystic ovary syndrome) and Low Lying Placenta was observed. We were in a lot of tensions. Dr never gave 0.1% tension to us, instead she says \u201ckuch nehi huya saab thik hai\u201d. She prescribed few medicines and polycystic ovary got cured in 1st trimester only and told Low Lying Placenta 90% patients get cured in later stages of pregnancy. \n\nFrom 1st week to last day till delivery, I used to vomit a lot. During these days, I used to visit Dr. Suman Singh twice a week. She always used to listen very patiently and prescribed medicine with multiple choices. Dr always treats us with a smiling face. By seeing her all my worries and pain vanish suddenly. We get positive energy once we meet Dr. and she always gave priority to my feeling and thoughts. During my 28 weeks, scan shown AFI level was gone low 7.8 mm. When we showed scan reports to Dr, she told to drink enough water regularly, prescribed a few medicines and my next scan after 7 days the AFI level was 10.5mm.  This is all possible because Dr. helped us to think positive towards any hurdles and worries during my pregnancy. \n\nI was suffering from severe vomiting, frequent motion and upper abdominal pain on 14th March. Dr. Suman Singh was out of the station on that day but still, she was in touch and connected with me.  Dr said to get admit in Rainbow and she had taken care of my treatment at the hospital. From 26th March morning onwards I was suffering from severe lower and upper abdomen pain and was not able to bear it. So I called Dr. Suman Singh at night 10 PM, she picked my call and told me to get admitted to Rainbow hospital. It was a late night so thought let\u2019s bear the pain tonight will go to the Dr. clinic on 27th March and will show her at the clinic. \n\n27th March - We visited Dr. Suman Singh clinic at 6.30 PM, she asked me Why you had not admitted to the hospital yesterday? Dr. told she could not sleep properly whole night as she was in believing that she can get a call from the hospital any time at night. After Dr examined me and told your labor pain had started, get admitted to hospital now will do Caesarean section delivery. We took a lot of tensions and asked Dr. What we have to say at the hospital? Dr told us with a smiling face, don\u2019t take any tension, go to the hospital rest I will take care of everything. The reply from Dr. given us a lot of strength and mental support to us. \n\nI got admitted to hospital at 7.30 PM, completed pre-joining formalities and nurses prepared me for Operating theater. Dr. Suman Singh reached hospital between 8.30 to 9 PM. By 9.30 PM, I heard my baby crying\u2026. When nurses showed my baby, my eyes were filled with tears. It\u2019s the best feeling ever had in my life and it was all possible only because of Dr. While Dr was leaving from OT, I told \u201cThank you\u201d and asked everything is fine right? Dr. blessed me by keeping her hand in my forehead and told: \u201csaab thik hai, kuch tension nehi hai\u201d. \n\nMy expected date of delivery was 8th April. I am very afraid of normal delivery. Dr. Suman Singh requested many times to me for normal delivery and explained me consequences of Caesarean section delivery, but I requested for planned C-section delivery on 29th March by consulting with the doctor. \n\nDr. Suman Singh has a very strong personality and salutes to her stamina. She is a great motivator and a very nice human being. Word\u2019s are not enough to express my feelings. Thank you very very much and I will very grateful to you. You made our life complete. I would strongly recommend Dr. Suman Singh. \n",

I was getting very stressed with the way they were handling my case and the unprofessional attitudes. One doctor told me I may have to go for a surgery Immidiately else I may lose the child. Fluid level is down and won't increase at all. Baby is underdeveloped blah blah blah. My husband comforted me and said nothing to worry as our report from dubai was very much positive . We changed to another doctor and didn't mentioned about this visit. After first check up she said everything is fine and then we told him about the first visit . She prescribed some test which we did and while test radiologist said things are alright but some concerns are there but not much. Doctor prescribed  some test and saw the report. After couple of days we went and she prescribed again same test . Luckily my husband saw and asked why again. Then doctor says oh i forgot you have done already. Then she says get ready for surgery next week. We got dissatisfied and looked all around for a good doctor who really cares for patient  and have respect to the concerns. \nI am very lucky that we visited Dr.Suman when in my 36 week. She is very caring and we liked her professional attitude and interest in patients. On the first visit we were so impressed that we decided to continue. She listined  the problem saw all the past records very carefully and explained us  with a very cool way. My fluid level went up from 7.6 to 11 in 3 weeks and I delivered a healthy boy in my 39 week with a birth weight if 3.07 kg and after one week of delivery now both of us are completely healthy. On behalf of my family I give a lot of thanks to Dr.Suman for her support; comfort and care she has shown to me. I can't imagine what would have happened if I would have gone for surgery at 34 or 36 week by following those unprofessional doctors who do not understand what stress people go through just because of there either ignorance or unprofessional attitude . I mean no offense to anyone but we are human being and common show some care and spend some time to understand the problem of the patient rather than being busy with your phone while patient with you and then giving your opinion.\n\nOver all I recommend Dr. Suman highly and would say that she is High skilled in her profession and very much approachable and have a superb pleasant personality with a lovely smiling always while showing interest to clarify doubts. THANKS A LOT DR.SUMAN.",

Even though we insisted for c section because of the pain, Dr Suman advised us for normal delivery and explained the life long benefits behind it. After long 12 hrs of labour pain I was blessed with a baby girl. Me and my family are very happy and thankful to Dr. Suman for the normal delivery. I highly recommend Dr. Suman Singh for all the female related  problems/ pregnancy.",

We had searched for the best gynaecologist around and her name surfaced online with the highest rating and best reviews. Right from the first visit, we were very comfortable with doctor and although I had unfortunately suffered a sudden miscarriage, doctor comforted us explaining how somethings happen naturally and sometimes for our best. After my miscarriage, I did not get my periods naturally for 5 months inspite of all my reports being normal and it worried me big time. But doctor very calmly explained to me that there is nothing to worry and asked me to lose atleast 10 percent of my body weight. She said just try to lose 10 percent of your current weight and you will get your periods. That was exactly what happened when I lost weight as suggested and I could conceive naturally after 3 months. My pregnancy was when covid was at its peak, but it was really nice of doctor Suman to have online consultations with me and I had visited her at the clinic only on my 12th week after I conceived. My pregnancy journey was very smooth thanks to her care and she asked me to register at Rainbow hospital due to which I could avail benefits of attending online classes on Labour pain and delivery, epidural, Breastfeeding and such other topics which were very helpful. In my 32nd week, we realised that my AFI was at border around 10.6 units and having suffered a miscarriage once I was worried. It was very nice of dr. Suman to calm me down saying everything is fine and it instilled a lot of confidence in me. She had asked me to walk as much as possible for normal delivery. My due date was 22nd March,2021 but on 14th March early morning I experienced water leak and was rushed to Rainbow hospital. I was induced around 7.30am and Dr. Suman had spoken to me on call to explain me the procedure and also visited me in my room sometime later. She comforted me saying that my labour is proceeding very well, asked me to take deep breaths and be positive. My delivery although vaccum assisted was very smooth as doctor explained me when and how to push very nicely.She was very supportive and encouraging throughout and helped us deliver healthy baby boy and she also joked saying dekho baby ka weight acha hai all thanks to the aloo bhujia that you ate during pregnancy :) She even played my favourite Om Namah Shivaay song for me and my baby Rudransh in the labour room after delivery :). Although doctor is very strict and professional, she has a very caring and warm side to her, always patiently listening and answering all my questions. I have already recommended her to all my friends and cousins in Bangalore. Thank you Doctor Suman for making my journey to motherhood such a pleasant experience and wishing you happiness and roaring success always :)\n\n- Your patient Vijayalakshmi Viswanathan",

On seeing the doctor she told us to get some tests done and the first scan too, apparently the baby\u2019s heartbeat was not detected and we were tensed to which she calmed us and told to repeat the scan in two weeks which we did and heard our baby\u2019s heartbeat for the first time. \nWith time passing the consultation *** **** *** **** *** **** ********* ** *********** ***** *** **** **** ********** ** *** ******. With every checkup in the last trimester doc advised to walk more and more to increase normal delivery scope and we followed. \nI out of fear was apprehensive about normal delivery and insisted for a c section however Dr Suman unlike other consultants made me relax and told me to be patient and go with the flow and wait for pains and also motivated by saying that since everything is going fine we will not go for section which actually changed my mind. \nDue date was Oct 18 and since pains didn\u2019t come till then, Doctor gave us a detailed session on 16 Oct of the flow of labour induction and how would it go. I got admitted on 17 Oct night 9 Pm and pain was induced and as per doctor\u2019s briefing the hospital duty doctor did the needful and throughout night Dr Suman was on call with the duty doctor on how am I reacting to the pain induction. As per duty doctors I was proceeding well exactly as per the schedule and opening as required. After the morning checkup it was noticed that the baby has passed meconium (first stool) and so we can\u2019t wait for the cervix to open completely for a normal delivery and Dr Suman guided the duty doctor at hospital to prepare for Operation immediately- this was at 8:30 Am and the doctor reached OT in 15 min ready for the surgery which was really amazing - that\u2019s how responsible the doctor is and took the ownership of reaching hospital on time for its patient wherein she could have told other gyanec to proceed with initial setups but she was in the OT even before I reached from 2nd floor of the hospital to 3rd floor. \nThe surgery was smooth n painless with Doctor talking to me and guiding me so nicely just like a family and Thanks to her and hospital team I delivered a cute baby boy. \nI wouldn\u2019t have sat down and written such a detailed feedback unless I mean it and I\u2019m really thankful to Suman ma\u2019am for her right guidance in my pregnancy. \n\nIf she weren't specialized, I'd see her for everything!\u201d\n\nThanks. \nMonika, Pranav, Baby Ansh",

                "review_text": "I waited for 9 months to share my feedback regarding my pregnancy journey with Dr. Suman Singh. \n\nWe are blessed with a baby boy on 27th March and we are overjoyed and extremely happy. It was a wonderful journey with Dr. Suman Singh which is really unforgettable.\n\nShe is extremely helpful, confident, graceful, attractive, down to earth, always listen to your problems carefully, give ample time to treat me and the main thing is she makes you so comfortable that you will just love her accompany. Dr., always gives us courage, a highly motivated person with great physical and mental strength and half of the problems get cured by seeing her. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss my pregnancy journey with Dr. Suman Singh -  \n\nDuring the initial scan, the impression of PCOD (polycystic ovary syndrome) and Low Lying Placenta was observed. We were in a lot of tensions. Dr never gave 0.1% tension to us, instead she says \u201ckuch nehi huya saab thik hai\u201d. She prescribed few medicines and polycystic ovary got cured in 1st trimester only and told Low Lying Placenta 90% patients get cured in later stages of pregnancy. \n\nFrom 1st week to last day till delivery, I used to vomit a lot. During these days, I used to visit Dr. Suman Singh twice a week. She always used to listen very patiently and prescribed medicine with multiple choices. Dr always treats us with a smiling face. By seeing her all my worries and pain vanish suddenly. We get positive energy once we meet Dr. and she always gave priority to my feeling and thoughts. During my 28 weeks, scan shown AFI level was gone low 7.8 mm. When we showed scan reports to Dr, she told to drink enough water regularly, prescribed a few medicines and my next scan after 7 days the AFI level was 10.5mm.  This is all possible because Dr. helped us to think positive towards any hurdles and worries during my pregnancy. \n\nI was suffering from severe vomiting, frequent motion and upper abdominal pain on 14th March. Dr. Suman Singh was out of the station on that day but still, she was in touch and connected with me.  Dr said to get admit in Rainbow and she had taken care of my treatment at the hospital. From 26th March morning onwards I was suffering from severe lower and upper abdomen pain and was not able to bear it. So I called Dr. Suman Singh at night 10 PM, she picked my call and told me to get admitted to Rainbow hospital. It was a late night so thought let\u2019s bear the pain tonight will go to the Dr. clinic on 27th March and will show her at the clinic. \n\n27th March - We visited Dr. Suman Singh clinic at 6.30 PM, she asked me Why you had not admitted to the hospital yesterday? Dr. told she could not sleep properly whole night as she was in believing that she can get a call from the hospital any time at night. After Dr examined me and told your labor pain had started, get admitted to hospital now will do Caesarean section delivery. We took a lot of tensions and asked Dr. What we have to say at the hospital? Dr told us with a smiling face, don\u2019t take any tension, go to the hospital rest I will take care of everything. The reply from Dr. given us a lot of strength and mental support to us. \n\nI got admitted to hospital at 7.30 PM, completed pre-joining formalities and nurses prepared me for Operating theater. Dr. Suman Singh reached hospital between 8.30 to 9 PM. By 9.30 PM, I heard my baby crying\u2026. When nurses showed my baby, my eyes were filled with tears. It\u2019s the best feeling ever had in my life and it was all possible only because of Dr. While Dr was leaving from OT, I told \u201cThank you\u201d and asked everything is fine right? Dr. blessed me by keeping her hand in my forehead and told: \u201csaab thik hai, kuch tension nehi hai\u201d. \n\nMy expected date of delivery was 8th April. I am very afraid of normal delivery. Dr. Suman Singh requested many times to me for normal delivery and explained me consequences of Caesarean section delivery, but I requested for planned C-section delivery on 29th March by consulting with the doctor. \n\nDr. Suman Singh has a very strong personality and salutes to her stamina. She is a great motivator and a very nice human being. Word\u2019s are not enough to express my feelings. Thank you very very much and I will very grateful to you. You made our life complete. I would strongly recommend Dr. Suman Singh. \n",

I was getting very stressed with the way they were handling my case and the unprofessional attitudes. One doctor told me I may have to go for a surgery Immidiately else I may lose the child. Fluid level is down and won't increase at all. Baby is underdeveloped blah blah blah. My husband comforted me and said nothing to worry as our report from dubai was very much positive . We changed to another doctor and didn't mentioned about this visit. After first check up she said everything is fine and then we told him about the first visit . She prescribed some test which we did and while test radiologist said things are alright but some concerns are there but not much. Doctor prescribed  some test and saw the report. After couple of days we went and she prescribed again same test . Luckily my husband saw and asked why again. Then doctor says oh i forgot you have done already. Then she says get ready for surgery next week. We got dissatisfied and looked all around for a good doctor who really cares for patient  and have respect to the concerns. \nI am very lucky that we visited Dr.Suman when in my 36 week. She is very caring and we liked her professional attitude and interest in patients. On the first visit we were so impressed that we decided to continue. She listined  the problem saw all the past records very carefully and explained us  with a very cool way. My fluid level went up from 7.6 to 11 in 3 weeks and I delivered a healthy boy in my 39 week with a birth weight if 3.07 kg and after one week of delivery now both of us are completely healthy. On behalf of my family I give a lot of thanks to Dr.Suman for her support; comfort and care she has shown to me. I can't imagine what would have happened if I would have gone for surgery at 34 or 36 week by following those unprofessional doctors who do not understand what stress people go through just because of there either ignorance or unprofessional attitude . I mean no offense to anyone but we are human being and common show some care and spend some time to understand the problem of the patient rather than being busy with your phone while patient with you and then giving your opinion.\n\nOver all I recommend Dr. Suman highly and would say that she is High skilled in her profession and very much approachable and have a superb pleasant personality with a lovely smiling always while showing interest to clarify doubts. THANKS A LOT DR.SUMAN.",

Finally, we came to know about Dr.Suman Singh from one of my friend and we consulted her. She listens very carefully and with lots of patience and guides us very correctly \ud83d\udcaf what to do next. Just within two months I got conceived with her treatment( no other words to express my love and joy and happiness except thanking her\u263a\ufe0f).Her treatment and guidance is very good and useful. Whichever scans, blood tests she asks us to do, are correct and perfect(without any loss of time and hope). Her treatment is perfect, good,excellent and if we can find any new words for appreciating her also can be added. Will be very much thank full to her life long. She supported very well throughout my pregnancy. She is the saviour. In our view whatever she tells is correct and we can trust mam blindly without any second thought. My delivery was done by suman Singh mam at rainbow children's hospital. I suggest every couple to consult her who are planning for pregnancy to get good treatment. She is very unique from other doctors.Thanks a lot mam. Thank you so much. Finally one word Dr Suman Singh is excellent \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude0d.",

Yes, we did read about some of the unwarranted negativity about Dr. Suman online, but trusted our gut and visited her nevertheless. This, we believe, is the best decision of our lives. I vividly remember our first consultation - she calmly reviewed all of the reports and files from the previous doctor. She smilingly explained the entire situation and our current position. She then made sure that Archana followed a strict diet and recommended certain lifestyle tweaks to help conceive quicker - great & successful advice. From the first time we stepped into the OPD of Cloud Nine Hospital, Jayanagar, to the actual day my wife delivered, Dr. Suman Singh took charge of my wife, her diet, her pregnancy, her health and eventually the baby. I've seen a few doctors in my life, but have never come across someone as amazing as her. To describe her better, she is highly professional, clam, polite, and extremely friendly. To her, no patient is more important than the other. Amazingly, she makes herself available when you need her most - time and again displaying uncompromising dedication. We had some anxious moments during the final stages of pregnancy, but Dr. Suman's calming presence eased our nerves and anxiety. She explained the process of delivery completely, allaying all our doubts. My wife gave birth to my son on 21st June through NVD, and we are eternally thankful to Dr. Suman. We hope, wish, and pray the best of health, wealth, and prosperity to her!",

We had a baby girl at Rainbow. Thanks to mam :) Cons for the Patient - :) (None for the doc) \u200cSince she is very systematic, you also need to be very systematic with your appointments n conveying the information back, unless its is an emergency case; Else you are not spared :)\u200c You can't just drop in and expect to visit her unless it's a real emergency;\u200c If you are not communicating  appropriately with timely tests n check ups, it wouldn't be a smooth discussion;\u200c Please go through the notice board, understand how she charges her visits and if you are fine with it, proceed further; Else you will only crib later as to why are you being charged for this or that\u200c Unless you are not ready work with her methodically, systematically, in an organized manner for your own baby, it will be a uphill task.\u200c Overall,I will definitely recommend her. She will do the justice to the duty. Once you understand how to work with her, its a easy task. Fyi - She reminds me of my strict school teacher :)",

I have mate several doctors in my life.\nMy pregnancy case was complicated and stormy, but the way Dr. Suman Singh handled all the phases, I must say, without her it would have been not possible to deliver a baby.\n\nPerfection:  When it comes to perfection, she knows what exact treatment she is going to do for patient and if she suggests some tests, she knows exactly why she is asking you to do that and she will explain you also in detail.\n\nResponsible: My delivery was planned at 9:30 AM, but due to some emergence I went hospital very early morning and when the duty Dr checked and explained my condition to Dr. Suman Singh, she immediately asked her to prepare me for the OT.\n I would like to appreciate her that she was there in OT within 10 Mins. And its not the easy thing for any person in that much early morning but She always takes the responsibility and ownership of her patient.\n\nThere are many other reasons, why I strongly recommend her like - Vast Experience, Friendliness, availability, Confidence and many more.\nI would like to appreciate, and thanks Dr Suman Singh for the treatment, just because of her we got the most precious gift of our life. \n",

I won't even know the cost of most tests if you ask me and it doesn't matter where you do it from. \n\nHow you perceive a test request is really a reflection of your regressive thinking and despite my best intentions of cutting down on your visits and inconvenience, you have failed to appreciate the logic here. Have already replied to this in detail on Google and do not wish to waste my time again.\n\nAll said and done, I didn't do anything to harm you while can't speak the same for you!!

She is so humble, so down to earth, and so conscious and concern Doc, we went with so much data and problems in the late night appointment but she gave me her quality time & reviewed my entire pregnancy detail. \n\nEverything was going fine & suddenly one day I diagnosed by her that I have Pregnancy induced Hypertension, she prescribed me only needed medicine , which exactly need in that condition. \n\nMy BP was not stable and finally she told my husband to admit me in Cloud9 hospital, we did the same, she monitored my condition regular and she made us understand  me and my husband the critical condition. I was carrying 34 week 2 days of  pregnancy. Me & My husband were not understanding the situation & we were not ready for emergency C section, She tried her level best to understand us.\n\nFinally after 2 and half days of monitoring when my baby became distress , finally Doc made the decision of emergency C-section. \n\nIn the evening without any delay she entered in operation room with her spirit and entire cloud9 team operated me. By God's grace & Excellent Dr's of cloud9 i have a adorable beautiful daughter \"Anaya\" today with this blessed life.\n\nI really appreciate her dedication, knowledge, continuity and discipline. She never keep off her eye entire my stay at cloud9 she monitored on regular basis in day and night. \n\nShe comes as a form of a God to save me & my daughter's life.  My family is great full  to Dr. Suman. \n\nI am writing this detail review because, before consulting her i was reading this very carefully, I feel my this feedback will sure help someone for a decision of choosing dr.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Suman & Cloud9 hospital staff and team  \n\n\n\nNiti Homendra & Anaya",

However if you urge for tests( that may not be required) for your mental satisfaction she will even listen to that and give her time as well.\nShe is also reachable on her mobile number and she is very quick to respond to the messages.\n\n\nA note to anyone having second thoughts, just don't pay any attention to the negative reviews here and just trust the doctor and her expertise. And for the people complaining about the fees,  it's a very nominal fee considering the treatment, the service that she provides and the time and effort that she puts. Moreover i have seen her attend patients back to back and even give time to respond to the innumerable text messages received. ",

My experience was not satisfactory. I was advised test and ultrasound because earlier also there was small cysts and upon test again there was a very small ovarian cysts in right ovary. Doctor recommended birth control pill to remove it and to repeat test after month. I did the same and after month there was an addition of one more small cysts in right ovary even after taking prescribed medicine. Then the doctor recommended high dosage of birth control pill and advised to repeat the test again after month. She said its normal till now and there is no signs of surgery now to which I got scared after listening to surgery rumor. Upon my husband's advice I consulted 2 more doctors of renowned world class Govt. hospital in New Delhi before taking high dosage. Both the doctors advised to stop the medications with immediate effect and have told me that I don't have any medical problem, they just recommended me to take folic acid tab and to reduce 3 Kg weight.\n\nTo my surprise they told me that sometimes doctors do prescribe tests and medicines to patient having no major issues so as to start the link of patient to that doctor for one or other reason.\n\nI am now relieved and will stick to the doctors of Govt. hospital of New Delhi now.",

I told her in the last visit that if culture is negative and if she is still having symptoms, she must see urologist to rule out stricture urethra and also evaluate for tuberculosis. \nThe evaluation for recurrent urine infections is done only after a person has repeat infections despite appropriate treatment.You are not starting from scratch again, it is the logical next step.\nWishing her speedy recovery.

It was during the peak of covid where in I was conceived and Dr followed all the covid rules n tried consulting as much as online itself for safety purpose. Her guidance and approach towards the medical treatment is on point. There were no unnecessarily conducting of tests or scans from the first day to till delivery and even now,  we know exactly what was and is going on. Both clinic visits and specially online consultations were prompt and satisfactory. During emergency Dr was available and responded immediately on time. My family (specially my mother) loved the Dr, the way she handled my case. Choice was given either to induce labour pains or opting of C sec during my 38th week as my Bp started varying, I opted for C sec. She is very experienced, caring and polite n mainly very professional. It was a wonderful journey with the doctor. Thankyou doctor. I would highly recommend Dr Suman Singh. ",

For second one, we were looking for a good doctor   here in bangalore. Glad that i found this doctor. Unlike my first pregnancy, i had lot of health complications after 20 weeks. Doctor clearly explained how i need to manage and overcome. During last trimester, the baby movements very coming down as the days progressed. we were very scared and consulted the doctor very frequently. Doctor always responded over phone and whatsapp. At one instance, doctor advised to go for C section at 35 weeks but we were very reluctant to decide. After lots of thinking we decided to go with doctors decision. Just after delivery doctor confirmed that there was \"true knot\" in the umbilical cord which could have been fatal if we had prolonged the pregnancy. Now both mother and baby are healthy and doing goodOnce again, Thank you doctor for all the care you have taken and for timely decisions you have made.",

I was reffered to her with one of our office friend and truly it was very nice experience. since it is our first baby so I also have many questions to get satisfaction and the doctor personally called me on phone and explained everything. Also She did an detailed analysis of my wife and explain each and every small things to my wife during the consultation. It was so nice of her to again put the same efforts to explain everything to me for my satisfaction. Sometime you may feel that doctor is little strict, but it's for patients benifit. The way she was explaining few things was like my family doctor giving us all the guidance. Thanks man for giving us such nice experience and answering all our questions. Being an outsider from UP, I felt overwhelmed by your gesture and support in calling me also in night after seeing reports. Now we feel that we are at right place & in right hands for our baby.. The reception staff at Manasi clinic is also very polite and supportive. One more good thing is that Dr. Suman only recommend test which are very important to do and medication is also very minimal.Truly recommend people for visiting..!! I know I have little written long story, but can't express my feelings in short quotes.. :) ",

Considering my 1st pregnancy was unpleasant with multiple problems with another doctor.  I was sure that Dr. Suman Singh can help me this time as I had visited her for abnormal bleeding which was treated in just 15 days. My treatment was too good during pregnancy and I delivered a healthy baby of 3.5 kgs. According to my reports,there was a risk of low weight baby,but doc made sure that I deliver a healthy baby with lots of tips . And about the delivery, though my delivery was planned,  I went into labor 2 hrs before and mam was there immediately for delivery.\nI had to go for c-section only due to previous pregnancy complications and mam knew that. Really  my family n me are very grateful to her.  *** ** *** *******",

We visited clinics, hospital and consulted many doctors but to be honest, it was not satisfying as its more of scary experience. We were very sceptical on the first visit with Dr Suman, but believe me, she is strict and talks straight without sugar coating, but you rarely find a caring, trustworthy and knowledgeable doctor like her. Initially she does few tests. We were wondering why the doctor prescribed test, and rather than speaking to us more, she was on another call. Later we found that there was an emergency baby delivery and she was instructing other doctors for treatment. From that point, we never questioned her work ethics. Just follow her prescription/suggestion and you will never have to worry on anything.We were having regular checkups and the day came where our baby was ready to meet us. Suman asked us to go for Normal delivery and she was confident that we can go with Normal delivery. But since my wife was little worried of few things, we went for C section and Suman got us delivered with wonderful girl baby now.We cannot thank her much for this beautiful journey and I would recommend her for anyone as there are 100 reasons to do so.",

My receptionist reiterated this again before you'll left.Yet you decided to flout the instructions again and came to the clinic. Whose fault is that?? Why do you think its OK for you to disregard the guidlines. We have to contain crowding in the clinic and allowing attenders inside for non emergencies is not acceptable as talking also spreads the virus especially since many of you are not wearing your masks correctly.Let me tell you also that sitting for more than 12 hours per day in a N95 mask and face shield without AC or FAN is extremely suffocating....most of us find it difficult to breathe / talk for extended periods .......but am sure you don't give a damn about our life or safety.However I have to factor in many things, including sterility of my chamber,safety of the pregnant women and my staff,given that ours is a small closed space. Your daughter is a smart educated girl ,didn't need you to spell out irregular periods for her.I had another teenager just like this yesterday and they followed my instructions...both mother and daughter were very happy with the follow up discussion on the phone.So,don't blame others when you are at fault.As for the fees,please do the math properly...after deducting taxes and consumables,I get only 300-500 which is what a plumber or an electrician charges!!.....and I haven't even  factored in the huge subscription costs of the expensive software that we use for the clinic management and the digital papers ...... honestly its too less for a senior doctor like me who is almost 50 years old with a vast experience.  Our charges are transparent and displayed on our notice board.If I was late ,that's because i had a patient from UK online who was desperate for help as they have no access to doctors despite emergencies...and just for the record ...am not rude ...am very friendly but a strictly no nonsense doctor.",

This is too much of charging. How do we recommend to others if every day visit there is a charge. This is the second time I have visited.

Hope my story will be helpful to the ones who are reading this review.\n\nMy First visit was in Feb'2019 when I had a PCOS,Fibroids,low vitamins(b12,D3 & CA). Dr thoroughly seen all my reports and suggested for 3months course for vitamin and PCOS correction along with diet chart, which helped me to reduce 2kgs(being a hypothyroid patient).\nThen I was asked for follicular scan in Jun followed by upt test. But unfortunately it was unsuccessful for me.\nThen in July'19, I didn't get cycle and visited doc again with my tsh report. She suggested for medicine for cycle(which was safe with concieve and I was not aware) and ultrasound. Again in 15thAug'19 I rushed to her with my upt +ve and was bit worried that medicine for cycle may hamper my baby. But believe me she consoled me that the medicine for cycle is safe with concieve and I was asked continued the same tablet for my first trimester. Her clear instructions and her expertise only helped me concieve and save my baby. Am really grateful to almighty that we are under supervision of a great doc.\n",

Thanks a lot to you Doctor for your continuous help and guidance and we are enjoying this new life of parenthood.\n\nDoctor is practising at Rainbow Children\u2019s Hospital and hence our baby boy got delivered there with supervision of Dr Suman Singh. As I was there in the labour room during the delivery, I witnessed a miracle that day which I never ever can forget in my life. Frankly speaking, I had very less faith in God through out my life but that day, as I witnessed a new life coming out to this world by Dr Suman Singh, it made me realise that if God really exists in this world then it must be in the form of great doctors like Suman Singh. \nWords won\u2019t be sufficient to Thank you from the deep of my heart. \n\nI am fortunate enough to get Dr Suman Singh.  My wife and I will be very very grateful to you through out our life.\nAs soon as my son become big enough to understand things, I will definitely bring him to you and introduce you.",

(For checking reports they charged 200 again- which means first day 500, 2nd -200 and scan & blood test - 1900, Total- 2600). And problem not solved.\nI thought, she is the best to address my health issue after going through recommendations, but it proved wrong.\nMy viewpoints.\n- Communication, people who are not fluent in English/ Hindi find it difficult to understand/communicate as she is very fast.\n- Cost, it's costed me 2600 including scan & blood test( not sure if these are required for my health issue), what surprised me is that to check reports which she suggested they charged Rs.200 mentioning im visiting again. \nThough my problem is not solved, I'm afraid to visit again because above reasons and I didn't feel as friendly, as she was little rude to me when I went with one report by saying to get all harshly & told me to control my 3year old kid when he is tapping the table.\n\n",

Through out checkups she has taken care of wife and baby. At the 3rd month of pregnancy my wife got severe stomach pains, we went to doctor around 8 PM given appointment as high priority  even though no slots for the doctor on that day. She was suggested us to go for scanning after seen her condition.  After scanning doctor suspected it can be Hetero-topic pregnancy(Its very rare pregnancy), confirmed around 9:30  and reacted faster than us, told us to admit into the hospital. She came to hospital around 11 O'clock and done laparoscopy surgery very careful to save both lives(wife and baby). Now we are blessed with a baby boy on  Nov 15th.\nGood thing are that she wont write unnecessary medicine and scans, Availability is good-even though with her tight schedules she will responds for calls and whats app messages(in emergency cases), she is very experienced doctor (To deal hetero topic pregnancy cases doctor should be well experienced and brilliant saving both mother and babies life is critical for this case),  Manasi clinic staff behavior is also good and they will try to serve as many patients as possible with less waiting time.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr Suman Singh.

I delivered baby boy on May 23rd. We thank Dr from bottom of our heart whole heartedly for such a wonderful caring and for travelling with us in whole of my stay in Bangalore.

Most of the patients says that she takes extra consultation fees, which is not at all true. She takes genuine consultation fee for her hard work, which is her hard earned money because she even has to lost her sleep for patients. She explains all the pros and cons of the treatment so that I anyone can make their decision to continue with her. She goes above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that her patient has understood all the things before they leave her clinic or hospital. I would like to recommend the doctor to anyone with full trust. Thank you Doctor for all the care and attention you gave to me during my pregnancy and post delivery.",

One of the most difficult step in this process was to decide who our gynaecologist was going to be. We consulted a couple of gynaecologists, however, we felt that our needs were not addressed. Later we came across Dr. Suman Singh, after the first consultation we knew we had met our doctor, it was peak of COVID, and she followed the COVID protocol to the T. We had many questions, which she addressed in a manner in which we could understand.\n\nAfter every consultation we felt that we were in the safe hands and our confidence only grew thereafter. We were particularly impressed by her attention to the detail and her meticulous planning.\n\nShe is someone who needs her things in order, be it preparation for the delivery at the labor room or the medical reports when you go to her during consultation, she needs it in an order, no compromise on that, this makes sure we have double checked our reports as well. This quality of hers is what we liked the most because we knew she would not leave anything for chance.\n\nArmed with her advice when we walked to the hospital on the DDay we felt well prepared, there came a point where she was giving instructions to the duty doctor at 3am and again she was talking to us at 8am in the morning. In the labor room when she was around, one understood that she was in-charge. Her presence of mind and timely decision making is something that we were impressed by. we have fond admiration for her for she knows what her patient needs and how to go about achieving it.\n\nWe had a natural child birth and we thank Dr. Suman Singh for all the care and advice she gave us.

Doesn't charge for any follow ups within 6 days of the initial visit. She monitors patients activities at a very close level and provides the required attention at the right time.\n\nWe have been blessed with a baby boy on krishna janmashtami i.e 6th of September and would definitely recommend people going there without any hesitation \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThank you so much Dr Suman Singh\n\nRegards\nAbhishek and ramya",

With her guidance, was able to conceive within the 1st month itself. Entire pregnency and delivery was v smooth. We used to look forward to meet her. She Used to explain everything so well. She is v professional, explains to the point, is genuinely concerned for her patients. I had been to a different city after i delivered and got a severe case of breast abscess there. Suffered 1 month in extreme pain. Inspite of consulting the best doctors there with \n35 yrs exp my abscess was increasing. My husband got me to bangalore immediately due to our trust in this doctor. And i started getting better in just 2 days!!!! She doesnt waste patients time, will not give false hopes and is quick to identify the issue. She is one of the few doctors who suggest tests that are genuinely needed. And she even explains the reason for all of the tests and medicines unlike others. Will answer all your questions v patiently. We adore and admire her. Her charges are also reasonable as compared to other doctors. ",

However you insisted that I give an opinion which was not possible.\nLastly you mentioned that you were taking an anxiety medicine and wanted to know if it was okay for you in pregnancy. You have not shared the prescription for me to know the correct name/molecule and I asked you to speak to your psychiatrist regarding the same as medications have to be continued after the evaluating the pros and cons completely.\nI started the consultation at 8: 14 pm and ended at 8:34 p.m., which means I gave you 10 extra minutes over and above the allotted time to you.\nIn the middle of a busy clinic when the other patients are being made to wait I think it is rather rude on your part to keep dragging the consultation especially when I cannot give an opinion due to insufficient data .\nAlso the poor network that Practo provides makes the consultation extremely difficult and laborious with multiple call backs often which is frustrating for both. \nMind you we are paid only 400 odd rupees for the consultation on Practo which is too less for the amount of time that we have given you.\nWe too feel short changed by both Practo  who charges exorbitantly for pathetic service and from patients who have unrealistic expectations from an online consultation . \n\n",

We were very anxious about the pregnancy and any procedure but Doc was very patient  and spend a lot of time explaining about the issue and complication we had.  Doc is very professional, she never hurries with any procedure and gets to the bottom of all issue be that be smaller or bigger by asking us to take all tests that's required.  She takes the time what needs to be done and provides valuable advice. We never regret for completely depending on her and trusting her. It's not easy to find a good doc as her. We highly recommend Dr. Suman Singh.",

We are not your slaves for you to dump your reports on a doctor's phone and expect her to give you her time and medical opinion without paying the professional fees. I have treated you earnestly for an ovarian cyst with medications instead of resorting  to surgeries ... And yet you do not even have the decency to acknowledge that. If you were so sure yourself that the report was normal you needn't have visited me. Most of the times we do not even remember your details on a phone consultation and since you hadn't shared any of my previous notes there was no way that I would give my medical opinion without understanding the case completely....and what a lie to say that I called you to the clinic!!!...when did I call you ???....i just left the default message for steps for online consultation on the whatsapp...For someone pointing fingers at others,your own morals are more than questionable !!What a waste of my time responding to this pettiness!!!",

Due to Covid situation you need to follow certain regulations when meeting Dr. Suman but please understand her availability is very important to every patient, due to which her own safety is critical. We are blessed with a baby boy and we are very Thankful to Dr. Suman for every moment when she gave a us a confidence that it would be fine. Her front office people also play a key role, follow all the norms and make sure that your appointment is on time as per schedule and goes smoothly without any hassle. A big Thank you to them as well. In a nutshell ' You are in safe hands with Dr. suman'.Thanks again and God bless you doc.",

TBH, I was pretty skeptical about seeing Dr.Suman after I read a recent negative review on Practo. But she was the closest to where I live and I went there with no choice. But trust me when I say this.. Dr.Suman is nothing of what was mentioned on the review. She is very friendly, kind and takes time to explain the problem. I have not started my medication so can't tell about the results but I am sure I will be fine because she addressed the issue correctly and she gave the right medication. Feel like I've found a gyno to stick with till am in this city. Also the clinic takes covid prevention measures very seriously! Kudos to that! ",

I sent her all the reports in whatsapp and she was very prompt in getting back to me by calling and explaining the reason for my symptoms which was an left ovarian cyst. She prescribed the medicines and made sure I was not panicking by explaining all the necessary things that could have caused this and how the medicines are going to work. I really appreciate this gesture of her because I have faced some other doctors in my life who doesn't really cares to give so much details. I am under medication now and believe that the cyst will be treated soon under the treatment of Dr. Suman Singh. ",

During this pandemic dyas, mam has taken care of distancing in clinic, which we felt satisfied visiting her. We did not felt a first timer parents during pregnancy as mam clearly explained us what should be done before next visit or what are things going to happen during the course of time.During the last week of pregnancy we requested mam for normal delivery before due date so as to have father and daughter same birthdays, she managed her personal leaves to help us. We are ever thankful to her for this help.We stand nowhere to rate or give stars to mams care , just big thanks.",

Dr.Suman was very friendly all throughout our visit. Our baby was diagnosed with IUGR during the anomaly scan and doctor explained the scenario well and gave all possible medication to keep the growth on track. We were adviced to get admitted for induced labour after 38 weeks. Dr.Suman has always encouraged us to go for normal delivery. But due to failed induction my wife had a c-section on 11/12 and she delivered a baby girl. C-section was done effeciently with no post operative complications. Both baby and mother are doing well after a week now. I would recommend Dr.Suman for all gyn and obs related issues. Thank you doctor once again.Regards, Ishani",

Having said that the doctor manages well and grabs the questions and clarifies them to our satisfaction. I have seen her to be quick in reading through the history of the patient records yet doesn't miss important points while also listening to questions and answering them. Doctor has been open to explaining the problems, treatment options available. She has also been reasonable in asking us to get the diagnostic tests done. My wife is now in her fourth month of pregnancy and we are hoping for a healthy baby in the next 5 months.\n\nOne thing I would like the doctor to do is to explain in advance the possible side effects of taking the prescribed medicines to help us mentally prepare to face them back at home.\n\nThanks\nNataraja",

My experience with her has been extremely good. She has a smiling face, always answered all my queries with extreme patience, never scared me. Prescribed tests that are only required and explained the reason for the tests prescribed. I had my delivery in cloud9 by Dr Suman. She tried her best in me having a normal delivery but due to a complication during labour, made the right decision and did a emergency c section. I highly recommend her.

We started consulting Dr. Suman Singh in August - 2014,when my wife was pregnant for first time.But due to few complications she had a missed abortion within couple of months of confirmation.We went back to her in the month September-2015, when my wife was pregnant again.We followed doctor's suggestions in throughout the pregnancy cycle. My wife delivered a healthy baby girl in the month of May-2016 in Cloud Nine hospital,in normal delivery mode.\nWe found her advises to be practical,genuine and has patience to answer our queries.As with any other doctor,on weekdays she takes extra time to discuss issues and specific cases,but on weekends she hardly gets time.Probably owing to the reasons that mostly people prefer to consult her on weekends and her clinic remains crowded.\n\nOverall we were satisfied and we recommend her.",

I was referring to another doctor for my pregnancy but in my last trimester I developed a medical complication for which I referred another hospital where dr Singh was Consultant. By seeing the report she diagnosed the problem (ICP withHELLP Syndrome) immediately and without any further delay took prompt decision for going for an emergency csection. she patiently explained me the issue and need to go for emergency csection. Because of her knowledge and her quick decision I safely delivered a baby boy. She is one of the doctors who share her number and is willing to listen to your concerns. I would strongly recommend Dr Suman Singh because she will be by side till the end and it's very important for patients to be confident that their doctor will be by their side. Thank you Dr Suman .

I then visited Dr Suman Singh who instantly started with the right medication and gave me reassurance. I was terribly worried about my baby's well-being throughout my pregnancy. But the doctor has always been there whenever needed. She is one of the very few doctors who share their personal number. She was always available on phone to attend your queries and guide you through emergency situations. She never refers unnecessary tests to be performed!! Also, she supported me throughout my labor and I went on to have a normal delivery. I am so grateful to Dr Suman Singh for monitoring me throughout that I am now blessed with a healthy baby girl. I would strongly recommend her.",

All this complications were warded off thanks to her genuine concern towards me. My husband and i owe her a lot for all that she has done. Thanks Dr.Suman.",

When I became pregnant a few months ago we decided to again consult with Dr Suman Singh even though we lived pretty far from her clinic ******* ** *** ********* ********* ** *** **** **** After the 6 weeks scan we found out I was carrying twins. As I was carrying twins, it caused a few complications. Dr Suman Singh identified every complication early and treated me accordingly. I had to consult with her every 2 weeks and I was at times anxious. She was calm, reassuring and guided me throughout the pregnancy with extreme care to me and my babies.She provided me with the best treatment I could have hoped for. Considering the complications, the pregnancy ended up being smooth. The delivery ended up being an emergency c-section. From my house I had called up the Doctor and informed her. Before we reached the hospital she was already there and ready with the entire team of doctors needed for the delivery. Within 30 mins of reaching the hospital, I delivered two healthy babies by C-Section.  I'm really thankful to Dr Suman Singh for the excellent care and treatmentI highly recommend Dr Suman Singh. She is ********* ******** calm and friendly. Can't thank her enough for the care she showed in both of my pregnancies. Thank you so much Doctor!",

I still haven't got my period....... And sent me a picture of your pregnancy test which was positive,expecting a urgent consultation from me despite giving a negative feedback!!! Isn't it shady on your part?!!\n\nSurprised by your double standards and diabolical attitude, I messaged you back saying that there was a discussion involved hence I had wanted to do a proper consultation for the same.\nWe are doctors and we understand what our responsibilities are very well at the same time we are not walk overs who will accept being exploited and abused by UN professional patients like yourself who are looking for free consultations and are willing to put us down when you can't have your way.\n\nHad been courteous in my WhatsApp message too...I quote-\"I cannot consult if a patient has been rude to me, once you remove the review I can discuss else kindly find another doctor\" \nYour reply to this message was a thumbs up sign and okay!!! I can share screenshot if you want!! \n\nIt appears to me that as an after thought you have decided to cry foul  probably at the behest of your husband .\nI have clearly mentioned that I was saddened by your husband's judgemental attitude, no where have I been harsh.Atleast have the integrity to speak the truth!\nI have stopped trusting some patients a long time ago as I have been cheated and back stabbed by patients like you many times .For those who put their faith in us,we are always watching over them at all times and strive to give them our 100%.You should see how others conduct themselves so pleasantly and how seemlessly we are able to do the consultations.\n\nEvery time we do our service In all honesty but we are appalled at the hostile and toxic attitude that you people have towards doctors in general.",

I have known her since mid of 2019 when I first went to her for a check-up as we were trying to conceive normally. She was polite, took time to explain things to us  and gave us moral support with better treatment before and throughout my pregnancy period, she always addressed our concerns patiently, be it when we visited her in person or through messages, she has always responded to my messages.\n\nAs I know she takes time with patients to promote a level of comfort and understanding that I have not experienced with any other doctor. Does not rush through appointments but sits and spends time with the patient to address all concerns and questions without making one feel guilty for taking up too much time and doesn\u2019t watch the clock while in the room with you. Very well versed in all manner of gynecological issues and is current with medical knowledge and treatment. I would like to thank the doctor and will specially mention \u201c This is the best care I have received from any doctor\u201d.",

My receptionist clearly told you that there will be no 2nd follow up charge for you but if you come after a week, there will be regular charges, which is reasonable. Only 2 % is charged on the card which is the bank charges. We only suggest Indus because it is nearest to my clinic, you are free to do the tests anywhere. I have explained all the reasoning during the consultation and if the costs are more, I really can't help it. Health is never an expense, it's an investment. ",

Her response to all our questions during this course of action made my wife relaxed and stay positive. We had just followed her instructions strictly until our girl baby has gotten delivered recently through LSCS with both mother and baby left being healthy.\n\nTo just brief about Dr. Suman Singh, she has vast experience in this field, highly professional at work and very specific. She does not prescribe unwanted medicines, scans, lab tests and follow-up visits when it is not really required.

She is extremely patient and understanding, and spends a good amount of time hearing out the patient and explaining the health related aspects; only, thereafter she allows you to pose questions and patiently addresses each of them. Even when she prescribes a medicine or a test, she kindly explains the accompanying reasons and barely leaves it to the patient to feel the need to have any follow up questions or doubts.  \n\nThe clinic is well maintained and the wait time is decent. Dr. Singh always wears a smile on her face which eases out your stress as a patient, to a great extent! She is also kind enough to make herself available on messaging for any questions or necessary follow ups from her patients. All in all, a great experience, I would highly recommend her to any woman in search for a reliable gynaecologist in Bangalore. ",

First she suggested for cervical stitches which later she only dropped as it increased with in a week, but still she asked me not to travel and on complete bed rest till 36th week. We follow the same and I happily delivered a healthy baby boy in my 39th week under her supervision.\n\nDr Suman is trustworthy, polite, always ready to answer your questions.

She was constantly discussing with another receptionist and hardly paid attention to the patients. I had to provide the blood pressure reading twice due to her negligence. After 2 days, I got an email that my procto appointment was a no show. I had to follow up with the proto team with invoice to fix this issue. \n\nReceptionist role is supposed to be hospitable but unfortunately it has become an authoritative role.

After our consultation(have closed it after one hour not in 7 minutes!!) and explaining how to take the medicines to manage your periods, then you send me multiple messages during the follow up with each message more confusing than the next. You don't even have the courtesy to write the dates properly, you are using an American system and interchanging the day and the month adding to the confusion as your message is incomplete and with every message you are wanting to use a different permutation of the medicine prescribed as per your whims and fancies. I had to spend so much additional time trying to understand your messages again and again ,finally I got fed up and I tried to call you but you were not connected on the app because of which I could not get through to you .Nonetheless I redid my prescription to suit your new requirements.\n\nInstead of wasting your time and my time writing such a lengthy feedback it would have been much better if you had put more thought into your consultation in the first place and neatly written down your requirements when we had asked you to do so.If you were better organised the confusion and rework wouldnt have been necessary.\n\nWriting multiple messages back to back during evening OPD hours will not help as I have only two hands to work with and the only condition on which I accept these online consultations on Practo is that I should be able to respond to them at a time that I am free ,after I have attended to my clinic patients.\n\nIf you do not have the patience to wait for a follow up response and expect an immediate response,let me inform you that it is not possible.We have been allotted 24 hrs to respond by Practo. \n\nYou are quick to call us unfriendly(because of delay in follow up) but I just find your whole attitude towards me rather rude and ungrateful especially when I was running high temperature and still working beyond my capacity to attend to your umpteen changes in requests.\n\nMost of you are not even aware of what you are entitled to in a Practo online consultation and unnecessarily keep ordering us to call you back which is also out of line.\n\nFed up with the unreasonable demands that people have on these online consultations I have reduced it drastically to spare me the headaches of these online consultations.\n\nI am more than happy to consult patients on my WhatsApp as I find the connectivity excellent and I am immediately able to reach out to a patient if I have to explain to her the medicines or at least leave voice messages for her to hear at her convenience",

                "reply_text": "You were a young 26 year old patient who consulted me mainly for reduced libido and painful intercourse.You were smug and dismissive, undermining everything that I was saying. Nonetheless I had answered all the questions that you asked.Am actually surprised by this review.Sometimes when a patient looks uncomfortable ,we may put off further probing to a subsequent session to reduce the awkwardness.\n\nSince the main concern that you presented with was lack of libido I took a complete history and then asked you to do a few blood tests including a thyroid test near your place Indiranagar itself and I also explained to you that I need to first ensure that you are otherwise healthy before looking into the psychological reasons for reduced libido.\n\nSince you mentioned that you had painful intercourse almost as if something was blocking the way, I told you to also do a scan to rule out  PID/ endometriosis and other causes which are common for painful intercourse.I also asked you to come and see me in the clinic so that I could examine you properly and evaluate the reason for the difficulty in having intercourse and rule out vaginismus/vaginitis/rigid hymen etc.More so since you were still unmarried I  didn\u2019t want you to be hurt or develop a phobia due to a painful experience hence thought to examine you before writing any medication.\n\nAppears to me that you were looking for some stopgap treatment and not a detailed evaluation.\n\nI have started my consultation on time and finished on time , not within 5 minutes as mentioned by you. The time stamp on my online chat and prescription clearly shows that I have given you full time. In fact I closed the consultation only after  20 minutes .",

Yesterday you messaged Rs 3000,you told my receptionist you spent Rs 5000 at your lab, now you are writing Rs 10,000??. Yesterday you were talking about my kindness, today you calling me rude?Stop harassing and exploiting doctors and treating us like your slaves.I have all your msgs as proof.\nYou and your husband gave me such a bad migraine headache yesterday that I had to Stop work and take medication and go to sleep.

Some patients try to hoodwink us by claiming it to be a free consult when it's not and so obviously get caught when the opd notes are shared. This patient was seen on 12th in Rainbow and despite being told to meet me directly with all the reports, decided to show me only scan on 12th and do a follow up on the phone on 15th for the blood reports; which I did without any charge as per rainbow policy.Since she was persistently anemic I had asked for a Hb electrophoresis to rule out thalassemia trait (medically required as thalassemics can't be given iron injections and also to rule out potential fetal problems). Now on 19th she again wanted me to do a free consultation which was out of place. Finally after sending me 9 msgs on my whatsapp she ordered me to give prescriptions on practo online consult which is registered under her husband's name,not her name... Hence I told them to stick to one portal for consultation as it's very time consuming and confusing to treat on 2 portals and maintaining records is difficult.Finally I got fed up with their attitude and cancelled their payment and refunded their money back to them. Anyday its more satisfying to see pleasant people rather than those who keep arguing unnecessarily. \n\nBabies don't get delivered by appointments!!! and we have no control on emergencies either. Sometimes patients come late and by the time they come I have to go to OT and then they get stuck. We have time and again requested patients to come 15 min early to the reception in order to finish weight and BP check so that they are on time for our consultations.I usually finish my opd before I go to the OT unless there is an imminent delivery or dire emergency which is understandable.",

Please think for a moment if it would be possible for her to send in walk-ins while appointment patients are waiting? My Saturday opd was full till 10 pm as I was in a seminar that day. Had you even once requested her stating the urgency she would definitely have accommodated.We always give priority to emergencies provided you communicate it clearly. Instead you were very rude and unnecessarily started shouting at her for no fault of hers and walked away. Notice boards are put up for patients to read, it's common knowledge. Only relevant tests have been written and I would have evaluated and explained everything had you come back. ",

I cannot be taking the burden of the bank charges for there are many injections which we give much below MRP and obviously I can't be paying for your treatment from my pocket.You can always pay by other means where there is no extra charge. \n\nIf a pregnant patient calls in the night with pain, how am I supposed to know the cause without examining.? Moreover phone consultations are banned by law. Hence we request patients to go to the hospital and the registrar will see and inform me.\n",

Which i feel its the best decision i have taken. There was many feedback saying she is ungenerous, angry lady etc. But i would say she is  nonr of the above. She always have a smile and she always care to disgnoise the patient throughly . My problem was solved just in 3 months and followed by that i was pregnant which was also handled by her. Through out pregnancy i never had a single complaint . Only issue i had was timing were somedays she was late . But that coudnt be helped she is a doctor and im not the only patient for her . She is very genuine in explaining all the procedure . Im still going to Dr suman for all my complaints . I havent had a single prob . I would really suggest few people to mind the language before posting . I really wosh Dr suman all the success \n\nThank you ",

All the tests have been explained to you and even though I was getting late for a surgery I did ask you to ask me all doubts. Irrelevant questions like what would be the shape and size of the baby had I been pregnant and had I aborted were not answered as I already explained to you that it was not applicable in your context and there was no need to get these gruesome pictures in your mind and instead to focus on the current problem at hand.\n\nIt seems that you are more offended with me asking you to wear the mask properly and in fact it was you who taunted me about whether coronavirus was still around.\n\nObviously you do not respect another person's safety let alone follow the rules of the clinic which you have signed up for.\n\nI was extremely courteous to both of you and ask you to come back with the report so that we can discuss your health concerns and help you plan your pregnancy.

Online Consultation started at 12.25pm and ended at 12.49 pm with the prescription after which you even thanked me since the previous doctor had given you an unnecessary long course of treatment!! Consultation was closed at 1 pm and automated msg sent to you if you had any queries for which you didn't reply!!. You had ample time to ask questions and clarify if you had any.\n\nNow, let me inform you that your consultation time alloted is only for 10 minutes for online consultations. Despite exceeding that and further giving you the option to ask questions to clarify your doubts, instead of being proactive you chose to write a negative comment. Weird!!\n\nAlso comment is by Sanjay who is not even the patient!!!\n",

You also saw the person who had an appointment for 3.30pm, come in late at 3.45 pm... Nonetheless apologies for keeping you waiting... While I was talking to the person, I had got a call from the hospital about a twin pregnancy referred to us for a complication in the babies, so you can understand, explaining the problem to the distraught couple, discussing medications to stabilize the brain and the lungs, neonatal icu counselling and need for an emergency surgery, all had to be explained and coordinated with the duty doctor and nurse.... Hence the delay. Anyways, happy to share that all went well for them eventually! \nAbout the other problem, your partner had come with a delayed period and pregnancy test was negative... I gave her the option of waiting for a week and retest pregnancy and then do the tests if negative as sometimes it may take time for the pregnancy test to show positive if there was a delay in ovulation. Am sure you understand the need to evaluate hormonal imbalances in case of erratic periods. ",

She was seeing dr aparna and had old reports of 2018 and follicular scans which were done couple months ago. Her beta hcg on 21st March was negative(0.16)if I remember correctly . But then she told me that her urine test was positive which is unlikely. Hence told her to repeat the beta hcg again and if less than 25(i wrote the value also on the lab request form) she could take the regesteron tablet to induce the period and see me with prescribed blood reports to induce ovulation properly again in order to achieve a pregnancy. I may be fast in my work but you must understand this is very basic for me. \nDue to the corona pandemic we have been instructed to limit patient time in the clinics too. Please appreciate that.\nRegards ",

She listens to any health issue(gynic) very carefully and provides apt consultations for the same. She has a positive mindset which gives you a comfortable feeling that any health problem is \"Not a big deal\". Also, best thing about her consulation is that she will prescribe only minimal medicines required for any problem.We had more frequent visits with her during last one year for child planning, pregnancy and baby delivery. Because of her supervision during this whole period, we had a very pleasant journey of becoming parents.Because of having so much interaction with her during last 1 year,  I am more than confident to suggest to visit her for any gynic related issues.",

Even banks are no longer easily giving 50/-. \n2.We do not charge a Registration fee which happens in most other places. \n3.We are constantly looking to upgrade our services & the practo software which enables seemless appointments and billing are coming at a cost. \n4.We are in the process of digitalising our OPD records for instant access anytime ...again at a cost. \n5.For patient convenience we have introduced valet parking in the evenings as a value add. \n\nAlways working on ourselves to provide better patient experience. :) \n",

Have complained to Practo several times but they just don't seem to bother... There are emergencies in clinic  and hospital too when these delays are just plain annoying to say the least.Practo has an annoying system of continuous notifications, so if the next consultation get delayed(we have only 2 min to respond!!)we get continuous calls which mute the ongoing consultation.. and delays it even further!!you shd be sitting with us to understand our side of the problem too . We are really trying our best . Payment is made to Practo , please voice your grievances to them for deficiency in service. They are charging us too for your consultation despite not providing a seemless platform for your consultation. ",

You called practo later and when the hospital got the appointment call they immediately confirmed the appointment and sent you the message. So the delay has been from practo and not from the hospital's end. Also you could have been more proactive and made the follow up call earlier giving you enough time to drive down.\nAs for my part, I saw you at 1.41 pm and finished the consultation by 1.56pm....so a good 15 minutes was spent with you,and I went 30 minutes beyond my working hours just to accommodate you. Have checked the patient, given her the medicines and told her all the dos and don'ts which I tell all pregnant women. Haven't missed anything according to me.Also because you had forgotten to bring your previous papers,I redid the case sheet all over again and made the antenatal card too!!\nDespite getting late for my appointment I tried to be as friendly as possible. Now, let me tell you how your being late affected me - I was supposed to see my old father's doctor as he is very very sick, but because of the delay I missed my appointment and had to wait until 4 pm to speak to him!!! So please remember walking in late to the hospital is not your Birthright! Make sincere efforts to report to the reception 15 minutes early for registration formalities. Don't make others suffer because of your complacencies.",

You also mentioned the flow was less . After hearing you out completely I have suggested standard relevant tests to understand cause of irregular periods and reduced flow and explained to you that I will revert back once I get the reports.Honestly nothing is missed from my side.\n\nIf you did not want to be investigated and only wanted a medicine for inducing a period you could have stated so... nothing was preventing you from saying that. \n\nWe would like to do a proper methodical evaluation of a patient as that is the right way to approach.",

Have gone back and checked our online consultation chats and I do not see anything wrong from my end. Also I am paid less than Rs 500 for a  practo online consultation.....which is lesser than my clinic charges,you feel it is high priced?? honestly for the unprofessional manner in which patients drag the consultation to hours its just not worth our time and  effort.\n\nI have responded to all your queries , gone way beyond my expected consultation time of 10 minutes and have even patiently waited during the delay from your end in sending me the reports. During the follow up you wanted to know if a brand substitution could be done which was addressed and when that  did not suit you and you commented that you had some side effects I asked you to see me but you did not want to and instead wanted a different prescription for which also I obliged.\n\nI honestly do not understand your  grudge against me as I have fulfilled my duties properly.\n\nI had asked for a CBC and random blood sugar test and you haven't sent the reports yet.\n\nYou have sent some irrelevant reports which are not related to your condition or what I had asked for and so I told you clearly to do the required tests and share but you neglected. \n\nIt is very easy to blame somebody else without understanding your own mistakes.\nAlso please be clear that the online consultation on Practo is for 10 minutes only and you are supposed to be ready with your details and reports uploaded before the consultation starts so that you  do not waste the doctor's time.\nBe mindful that there are other patients waiting and their notification keeps coming to us as a reminder that we need to conclude ongoing consultation.\n\nWhile paying for Practo you would have been aware that the follow up will be only through messages and we have 24 hours to respond to your follow up messages subject to our schedule. If you see properly I have not faultered in my consultation at all.",

You also thanked  me and said that you understood the problem correctly .I am actually shocked that you have written such a negative feedback am really lost for words. No where have I been in a hurry and I have asked Practo to review the tape and consultations.Seriously ,all the people who heard the recording are shocked at your behaviour and have vowed that karma will teach you to appreciate well meaning advice.",

Infact so many patients have complimented her on her friendly behaviour.\nA consultation fees of Rupees 700 valid for 6 days for a senior doctor with over 25 years of experience is very very low to be honest. \nFollow up has been done and reports were normal.One test is pending from your side after which the final discussion can be completed.Same was communicated to you during the followup.\nRegards",

Hence there is no way a consultation can be left incomplete..... Sometimes the prescription is uploaded but because of the poor network issue at your end it doesn't go to you, however for this there is a chat option available for you to reach out to us ...seems like you are unaware of this. All our online prescriptions are neatly filed and can be easily retrieved.\nAs for the charges well what can I say Practo takes the money from you,so you can discuss this directly with them.\nI see that Practo has blocked out their name from your feedback while trying to make it appear to be a complaint only about me....1/5/22...reviewed your details after procuring it from practo..you had a complaint of post coital bleeding for which you had already shared your thyroid,prolactin and USG reports and after seeing them i have clearly told you that they were normal.Have asked you to do two other tests and also visit a local gynecologist for an internal examination as bleeding after intercourse mandates this examination to rule out cervical causes of bleeding which cannot be determined on a phone consultation or ultrasound.The prescription was clearly written and the same is also seen by you.You haven't reverted with the reports.Do you know post coital bleeding can be a  symptom of cervical cancer!!how does one diagnose it without checking????Just because your knowledge of the subject is limited does not mean that we dont know our job!!!",

Also saw all the reports that you had on your phone... It was a long list.. Anyways, Started discussing all her medical issues with her and told her that she needed to see a physician for her medical issues and her high BP. When I felt that she wasn't comprehending much, I broke the protocol and allowed you inside (we have not been allowing attenders since Covid-19) and again repeated the whole discussion about her medical issues and bp. Told you that alprax wasn't a good choice of medicine for her given that it's addictive. Also discussed hot flushes and post menopausal symptoms. Gave her the recommended gynec tests and gynec medications and told you to follow up on the phone as I didn't want her to come out and risk herself in this pandemic. What more do you need? So disrespectful and ungrateful. Finding faults with others and trolling senior people without any understanding seems to be the favourite pass time of some people. We have been specifically instructed not to spend too much time with each patient.. A pandemic is not the time to get chatting with patients. Most of us are putting ourselves and our families at risk for ungrateful patients like you. Look inside and ask yourself a few deep questions. Appreciate what you have and respect it. You never know what you might get in the future!!!! ",

For subsequent visits the tests are written in advance so 90% of patients don't need 2 visits.Doctors work for long hours beyond the norms set by labour laws yet we never get paid overtime!! Think about it with a reasonable mind... the amount is actually very less compared to our contemporaries in other professions.We also don't have any of the perks that other professions enjoy like gratuity,retirement benefits,paid holidays ,stock options ,bonus etc. Most doctors feel exploited ,overworked and underpaid! There is a lot of burn out in the medical fraternity,doctors die 10 years  before the average human due to all this stress  yet patients are only happy to find fault with them.Honestly after almost 25 years of practice, spending the best years of our lives with books and in hospitals, to have a 20 something patient who doesn't even get her spellings right ,question our  fees /seniority and clinical acumen is insulting to say the least. Today even a plumber charges minimum of Rs 500 and most of all is spared the chides on social media!!",
