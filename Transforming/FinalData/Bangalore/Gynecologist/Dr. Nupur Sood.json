She busted all myths and misconceptions I was fed by  friends, family and internet2. She listened to every action I was doing to handle pcod and conceive and helped me to course correct them3. She interacted as if she is talking to her younger sister and has been there always to support me morally since I met her till I deliver my baby and beyond. I conceived after 3 months which was not possible with the most celebrated Doctors with bloated prescriptions for an year. again, after 4 years, she facilitated my son's circumcision with the best doctor in her network which means a lot. I really recommend the doctor for any girl. ",

I would like to express my thanks for her professionalism, understanding and the top class treatment I was given.\nAs frankly speaking, now a days having a normal delivery is a big task as other hospitals Strictly follow C-Sec. and most of the Doctors also suggest for C-sec. \nbut I must say Dr. Nupur Sood is a perfect doctor for those patients who has a fear of C-sec. she tries her best for the normal delivery. \nIn simple word I can say she is a lucky charm filled with positive nature. \n\nAfter the post delivery I had breathing problem as it doesn't not involve gynaecologist involvement. But still Dr.Nupur has taken all the initiative to guide me and she also visited me to know my Heath condition. And over the phone also she was asking about my recovery. No such doctors does this to any patients. \n\nI definitely recommend Dr. Nupur Sood. \n\nRashmi Shetty \n",

I would like to express my thanks for her professionalism, understanding and the top class treatment I was given.\nAs frankly speaking, now a days having a normal delivery is a big task as other hospitals Strictly follow C-Sec. and most of the Doctors also suggest for C-sec. \nbut I must say Dr. Nupur Sood is a perfect doctor for those patients who has a fear of C-sec. she tries her best for the normal delivery. \nIn simple word I can say she is a lucky charm filled with positive nature. \n\nAfter the post delivery I had breathing problem as it doesn't not involve gynaecologist involvement. But still Dr.Nupur has taken all the initiative to guide me and she also visited me to know my Heath condition. And over the phone also she was asking about my recovery. No such doctors does this to any patients. \n\nI definitely recommend Dr. Nupur Sood. \n\nRashmi Shetty \n",
