She thinks from the patients perspective .She really helped us not only emotionally in our pregnancy journey but also guided us the best options/hospitals for delivery based on our financial situation. We seldom see such doctors who genuinely thinks about her patient. She doesn't ask you for unnecessary scans unless until required, neither she recommends unnecessary medicines.Though we were hypertensed and nervous , she assured us with a great confidence .Even during and after the delivery she made sure that we are emotionally and financially comfortable during our stay in hospital , when we say financial comfort it is due to this incident:We had to extend our stay in the hospital due to babys checkup and vaccination , Shilpa ma'am discharged me as per the planned scheduled so that we will be incurred with only baby expenses during the extended stay.This was really thoughtful of her in not increasing our expenses unnecessarily.She did my delivery with out any complications , it was a smooth sail for us during these uncertain times .We really thank Shilpa ma'am from botton of our heart for supporting us through out.Highly recommend her .",

It was only Dr.Shilpa\u2019s expertise that she identified it at the right moment and helped me deliver my healthy baby boy. \n\nShe even checked on me post delivery till I was discharged and came home. \n\nMy husband and I would just want to thank Dr.Shilpa for making our pregnancy journey so smooth and stress free. \nCannot recommend her enough!

She thinks from the patients perspective .She really helped us not only emotionally in our pregnancy journey but also guided us the best options/hospitals for delivery based on our financial situation. We seldom see such doctors who genuinely thinks about her patient. She doesn't ask you for unnecessary scans unless until required, neither she recommends unnecessary medicines.Though we were hypertensed and nervous , she assured us with a great confidence .Even during and after the delivery she made sure that we are emotionally and financially comfortable during our stay in hospital , when we say financial comfort it is due to this incident:We had to extend our stay in the hospital due to babys checkup and vaccination , Shilpa ma'am discharged me as per the planned scheduled so that we will be incurred with only baby expenses during the extended stay.This was really thoughtful of her in not increasing our expenses unnecessarily.She did my delivery with out any complications , it was a smooth sail for us during these uncertain times .We really thank Shilpa ma'am from botton of our heart for supporting us through out.Highly recommend her .",

We had almost lost all the hopes and that's when we got to know about Dr Shilpa and rushed to her for the help. She was extremely patient with us, carefully listened to our problems, gave attention to every details. She explained us the medical situation, various possible outcomes, prepared us mentally for any situation. It was all because of her, we could feel positive and confident on handling this particular situation. She suggested some changes in the medicines. We followed her advice completely. As a result, now my wife is currently in the 6th month of her pregnency with her health being absolutely fine. Thanks to Dr Shilpa for her immense support and guidance. She is always available  (even over phone) to resolve our queries. Very very positive, extremely patient and gives appropriate guidance.   The doctor indeed made us believe in the saying \"Vaidyo Narayano Harihi\" (Doctor should be seen as God), with the every interaction that we had. I highly recommend Dr Shilpa for everyone to have a smooth and tension free maternity phase.",
