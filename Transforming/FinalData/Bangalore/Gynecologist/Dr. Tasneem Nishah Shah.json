I had many complications like placenta previa initially , so she asked me to take rest and be careful. Then i had covid, gestational diabetes, colastasis. She explained us all the complications and risk factors and took my pregnancy seriously. I got normal delivery on October 2022 and my husband and I both are very thankful to Tasneem mam. She has given us a beautiful and cute Angel.",

She will never encourage C Section unless there is need. Because of this doctor I delivered normal if she was not there I would have opted C Section. I will recommend her with confidence.

It was  a premature delivery for me 2 months in advance , Dr. Tasneem and her entire team in the hospital were making me feel so comfortable that I felt as if I am at home. It was a normal delivery.

She was available 24*7 to clear my doubts and give guidance from the very 1st day of my visit.I was rushed to hospital with water bag leakage at 1am, and with no time she reached hospital.And rest all miracle happened through her hands, i got an angel within next few hrs.I have just heard that God appears in different forms,for me he appeared in her form. I would recommend her with confidence, that anyone who visits her will come out with a complete satisfaction. ",

She listened to us with patience and answered all our concerns in our every visit and  I'm never treated in hurry by her. She will not suggest unnecessary tests. She will never encourage C Section unless there is need. Because of this doctor I delivered normal if she was not there I would have opted C Section. I will recommend her with confidence. Thanks a lot madam for all the support and making my motherhood journey as a most memorable experience of my life.\n",

It was  a premature delivery for me 2 months in advance , Dr. Tasneem and her entire team in the hospital were making me feel so comfortable that I felt as if I am at home. It was a normal delivery. I am thankful to Dr. Tasneem and her entire team for their expertise and help. She is a wonderful doctor with immense knowledge and expertise and a lot of humility.",

Since we were new in bangalore we were not having idea about best gynaecologist to whom we can consult. We have visited 2 more gynaecologist but we were looking for hospital which will be near to our home. One of my friend suggested name of Tasneem ma'am. We have visited her for routine checkup. I had c section delivery on 7th jan 2020. It was a very nice experience. Since i have suffered a lot in my first c section, so i was afraid of it. Due to presence of Tasneem ma'am everything goes very well and i have recovered soon. She is like god to us.Thank you so much ma'am. She is one of the best gynaecologist. I highly recommend Tasneem Shah ma'am. ",

She will never encourage C section unless there is a need. During delivery, though I was having low confidence, she gave me lot of confidence to go through it and helped for normal delivery.Thanks alot for her continuous support and guidance. I highly recommend her.",

Whenever we were low due to any issues, she always boosts our confidence that we will go through till 9th month.  Our admission to Manipal hospital Whitefield for delivery was unexpected and was in rush due to water bag leakage. We called doctor early morning 4am and to our surprise she picked the call and asked us to admit immediately. Within one hour she was in hospital to handle my case. Finally we were blessed with baby girl. Thanks a lot for her continuous guidence and support.\nDon't hesitate to contact her for any gynec issues. I highly recommend her to anyone.",
