Note:it depends on how to extract information.\nImprovements:\n1.Need to prepare strong back up and support team for her.Team cant match her skill and expectations it creates few unpleasant things but she care for patients point of view and fix once you bring to her notice.I believe her team should be ready to learn from experience rather all patients go and bring her notice.\n2.work life balance to increase her productivity and service to her give her best potential out to all.As per my personal observation and Interactions Now she is having very tight schedule handling emergency,Daily consultation without any break from work this for me its quite stressful and would not really help unleash her highest potential and quality of service.\n\nOverall we are very happy in this one year journey with her.",

In fact we had visited Cloud nine for our first delivery as well, but since we were completely dissatisfied with the earlier doctor (Not naming the doctor due to goodwill), we wanted to have a better experience and thus Dr.Meenakshi Kamat happened.\n\nFrom day 1 of visiting her, she took utmost care of me. I in fact had a low placenta issue which is usually high-risk pregnancy care but without scaring me or my husband, she took us through the precautions to be taken care since the first tri-mester until I actually delivered.\n\nDr.Meenakshi is always patient, polite, humble and very social. She takes the extra step to know about the family and understand us better to suggest better food options and medicines that are compatible and palatable:) She always takes time to talk, socialize, examine and provides proper feedback and information.\n\nEven if there are things that could be potentially complex topics, she takes the time to explain in an understandable manner and until we get it. My son who was 5 years when we started visiting her in fact became very friendly towards the end because of the rapport the doctor established.\n\nShe is always smiling and never in a hurry or showed frustration for any reason on me (patient) even though her day might be bad. She handles pressure so cool and calm and we really liked the whole experience with her.\n\nWhen the final D-day came, (MIne was a C-section due to the low placenta issue and the first delivery was a C-section as well) she handled the whole delivery so well and even the post-pregnancy care was well managed.\n\nWe would recommend this doctor as a MUST-VISIT doctor for your PREGNANCY CARE. Thank you so much doctor and we have a lovely daughter because of you. We are really thankful and grateful for your services.",

She takes good care of her patients and answers your query through what's app and through calls as well. \n\nThank you so much Doctor for all your support.

I was actually surprised at myself that I could finally do it. \n\nMy Husband and I can't thank her enough for motivating me throughout my pregnancy journey. \n\nFinally I would like to say the entire experience of my pregnancy and delivery went really smooth because of Dr. Meenakshi Kamath. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr. Meenakshi Kamath to everyone who is looking for doctors who are giving correct treatment as required for the patients.",

Note:it depends on how to extract information.\nImprovements:\n1.Need to prepare strong back up and support team for her.Team cant match her skill and expectations it creates few unpleasant things but she care for patients point of view and fix once you bring to her notice.I believe her team should be ready to learn from experience rather all patients go and bring her notice.\n2.work life balance to increase her productivity and service to her give her best potential out to all.As per my personal observation and Interactions Now she is having very tight schedule handling emergency,Daily consultation without any break from work this for me its quite stressful and would not really help unleash her highest potential and quality of service.\n\nOverall we are very happy in this one year journey with her.",

In fact we had visited Cloud nine for our first delivery as well, but since we were completely dissatisfied with the earlier doctor (Not naming the doctor due to goodwill), we wanted to have a better experience and thus Dr.Meenakshi Kamat happened.\n\nFrom day 1 of visiting her, she took utmost care of me. I in fact had a low placenta issue which is usually high-risk pregnancy care but without scaring me or my husband, she took us through the precautions to be taken care since the first tri-mester until I actually delivered.\n\nDr.Meenakshi is always patient, polite, humble and very social. She takes the extra step to know about the family and understand us better to suggest better food options and medicines that are compatible and palatable:) She always takes time to talk, socialize, examine and provides proper feedback and information.\n\nEven if there are things that could be potentially complex topics, she takes the time to explain in an understandable manner and until we get it. My son who was 5 years when we started visiting her in fact became very friendly towards the end because of the rapport the doctor established.\n\nShe is always smiling and never in a hurry or showed frustration for any reason on me (patient) even though her day might be bad. She handles pressure so cool and calm and we really liked the whole experience with her.\n\nWhen the final D-day came, (MIne was a C-section due to the low placenta issue and the first delivery was a C-section as well) she handled the whole delivery so well and even the post-pregnancy care was well managed.\n\nWe would recommend this doctor as a MUST-VISIT doctor for your PREGNANCY CARE. Thank you so much doctor and we have a lovely daughter because of you. We are really thankful and grateful for your services.",

She takes good care of her patients and answers your query through what's app and through calls as well. \n\nThank you so much Doctor for all your support.

I was actually surprised at myself that I could finally do it. \n\nMy Husband and I can't thank her enough for motivating me throughout my pregnancy journey. \n\nFinally I would like to say the entire experience of my pregnancy and delivery went really smooth because of Dr. Meenakshi Kamath. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr. Meenakshi Kamath to everyone who is looking for doctors who are giving correct treatment as required for the patients.",

This was our first child and needless to say we have had a lot of questions throughout the journey. \nBut Dr. Kamath made the journey so smooth. *** ** ********* ************** ******** *** ******** She kept an open line of communication throughout the journey. I noticed that she also keeps her team on their toes, although the hospital's admin team needs to do better. She is very hands on in the care she provides and will put her best effort to try for a normally delivery. As overwhelming as this journey can get, it helps to have someone with her set of skills by your side. We had a wonderful holistic experience with her and would definitely recommend her. Thank you Doctor for delivering our baby. ",
