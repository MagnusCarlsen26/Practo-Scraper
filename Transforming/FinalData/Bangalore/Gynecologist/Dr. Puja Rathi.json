Post that throughout my pregnancy she has been quite assuring every step of the way.  This was my second pregnancy, although I wanted normal delivery but wasn't very hopeful of it because I had been quite inactive this time around  She has been savior to me and helped me deliver vaginally. In all I found her to be extremely knowledgeable,  prompt in her decisions, approachable and gives proper time for solving all the queries. I will totally recommend her. Thanks to her despite having cervical incompetence and an inactive pregnancy,  I ended up delivering vaginally. ",

Puja Ma'am made the entire journey very very smooth. Always ready to hear the facts/issues/concerns from us very patiently and her response was amazing. Always smiling and honest remarks.Whatever things/steps Ma'am suggested, we followed it very honestly and heartedly.One very Important things which I must say here happened on the day of delivery, my wife almost lost that hope that she will be able to do NVD but Puja Ma'am continuously calmed her and assured her that she can do it as NVD eventhough my wife was having GDM(on insulin).Grace to God that we choose Puja Ma'am as our Gynaecologist.Thanks to Puja Ma'am and team!RegardsAlok & Shuchi",

She will tell very much clearly about your problem and what you need to do. If you follow-up properly what she suggest then you will definitely feel improvement. I strongly recommend Dr Pooja Rathi is the very much famous doctor for gynecologist., .. Hope this review will help you lots to choose your doctor. Motherhood has very good experienced and well-qualified doctors. The staff is also very supporting and good. I would like to put this hospital at first place in a list of recommended hospitals.",

Post that throughout my pregnancy she has been quite assuring every step of the way.  This was my second pregnancy, although I wanted normal delivery but wasn't very hopeful of it because I had been quite inactive this time around  She has been savior to me and helped me deliver vaginally. In all I found her to be extremely knowledgeable,  prompt in her decisions, approachable and gives proper time for solving all the queries. I will totally recommend her. Thanks to her despite having cervical incompetence and an inactive pregnancy,  I ended up delivering vaginally. ",

She will tell very much clearly about your problem and what you need to do. If you follow-up properly what she suggest then you will definitely feel improvement. I strongly recommend Dr Pooja Rathi is the very much famous doctor for gynecologist., .. Hope this review will help you lots to choose your doctor. Motherhood has very good experienced and well-qualified doctors. The staff is also very supporting and good. I would like to put this hospital at first place in a list of recommended hospitals.",

She is very approachable n prompt over mails.\n\nShe is well experienced and explains every detail to her patients. I would go to her everytime I need any medical advice.\n\nHer smile makes our day everytime we visit her. She never let me panic anytime throughout my pregnancy even if I am hypertensive. She remembered every progress and has been very supportive. I absolutely love her way of treatment. I felt relaxed, active and jolly during my pregnancy....Big thanks to Dr.Puja.",

My wife is diabetic  but throughout the  journey from pregnancy till delivery everything got handled with precision.

I have a history of consulting Cloud 9 doctors and I have come across very humble doctors who don\u2019t throw attitude and make every effort to help a patient. I did not consult for pregnancy however I had a few questions in my mind related to dieseases in women and also the fees that doctors charge for just checking your report.  It\u2019s sad that an educated lady doctor should behave rudely with her patients. Being the daughter of a cancer victim I get scared while visiting any doctor and that gives rise to many questions in my mind and I tend to ask them just be more informed. When I pay a doctor I expect them to give me a reassurance and not negative vibes. Being educated means humility and gentle attitude towards someone with a problem. If you are a patient like me then you certainly don\u2019t deserve a doctor like Ms.Rathi. I was literally in tears after my consultation only because of her behaviour. Although my friend had warned me that she can be rude, I still went ahead with her.",

I visited the doctor three times but could never meet her on time even once. Delay wasn't due to extra time of previous patient but because of doctor not coming to work on time. Her first appointment is 8:30 am but she wasn't in before 9 either of the three times I visited her. Today she was 50 mins over and didn't bother to apologise. Moreover she was rude in her talks. I had reports on mobile she says \"this isn't fair you didn't bring print out you were waiting so long\" I wasn't waiting in a garden but for her to come to work. We are in digital India where cloudnine doctors prefer to use paper and make a big fuss of it if not available. Moreover her tone was very rude. Such behavior impacts patient's health further. There is no trust on a person behaving like this. Doctor's are preferred to be polite and willing to hear the patient and make them comfortable. I can tell you making comfortable is far off rather she disturbed me more due to her rude behavior. Last thing I expected from cloud nine. I have to switch my doctor can't afford to stress further by consulting this doctor. Hope doctor learns to be polite and most importantly be on time to work. ",
