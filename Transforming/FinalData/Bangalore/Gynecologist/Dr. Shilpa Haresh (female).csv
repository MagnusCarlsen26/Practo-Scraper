"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"We visited the hospital for pregnancy related issues. Dr. Shilpa Harish was so patient and cooperative enough us to explain our condition and was with us throughout our memorable pregnancy journey. I got conceived in the month of April via IVF with the help of doctors and gods grace. But my pregnancy journey was not so smooth. Had complications of spoting in the initial days, experienced heavy bleeding in the 4th month due to low placental line, my cervix was opened up at 28th weeks and lastly had to deliver at 36 weeks due to BP fluctuations. In this tough journey Dr. Shilpa was always with us in reach everytime. She has responded to all our messages and during my 4th month bleeding she was present in the hospital at midnight before we reach there to assist us. Also, the cervix operation was carefully done and after which she was so kind enough to send her staff nurse for every 15 days to our house to provide me injection and vitals check. Here, I would like to mention the kind staff nurse as well as housekeeping staff who has helped me in this journey. Special thanks to Dr. Chitra, Shilpa sister, Maheshwari sister, Beti sister and Pilamma aunty. Just want to say that we were in right hands.
