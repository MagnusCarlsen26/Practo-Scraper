As my pregnancy journey comes to a joyous end with the arrival of our precious baby, I am filled with immense gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional care and support you provided throughout this remarkable journey.\n\nIn the early days of my pregnancy, I had other gynecologists, and I found it extremely frustrating during visits when I felt rushed, confused, uncomfortable, and even left with questions I still needed clarification on. Choosing you as my doctor was the best decision I have ever made. I received completely different care from you. You have always listened to every single question and concern of mine and have given extremely thorough explanations that I actually understood.\n\nFrom the very beginning, your expertise and genuine passion for your work were evident. Your thoroughness in monitoring the progress of my pregnancy, your attention to detail, and your willingness to address any concerns made me feel confident and well-cared-for at every step. I remember running to Google for every diagnostic result or scan comment and getting panicked; the best advice you gave me was not to Google things but rather to ask you, and believe me, that made my journey peaceful. I know sometimes I was annoying and asked irrelevant questions, but you never lost your calm. That's why I call you my peacemaker ;)\n\nYour approachability around the clock made me feel secure and relaxed; you were always just a ping away for me. The way you explained each thing, be it my food intake, exercise, or even tiny details of my daily routine that needed care, was remarkable.\n\nThe day of delivery was nothing short of extraordinary. You were never in a hurry, as you told me in the beginning that I was going to have a normal delivery. Without your encouragement and support in the labor room, it wouldn't have happened. My family and I are incredibly grateful for the safe and healthy delivery of our baby.\n\nBeyond your medical expertise, it was your kindness and genuine interest in our well-being that made this journey truly special. Your commitment to fostering a positive and trusting patient-doctor relationship has left a lasting impression on us. * *** ******** *** *** *** *** **** ****** * **** **** ************ and I am a patient of yours for life.\n\nThank you, Poornima Ma'am, for being an integral part of this incredible chapter in our lives. Your genuine care has made our pregnancy and delivery experience truly memorable. We feel blessed to have had you as our gynecologist.\n\n*** *** *** ** *** **** ******* ********* *** **** ***** I will HIGHLY recommend you if anyone needs a doctor who listens to their concerns seriously; they will not be disappointed in the care they receive!\n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\nJuhi",

                "review_text": "Journey of Kavyashree , Baby Hithashree \ud83d\ude0aCloud Nine Old Airport branch is absolutely professional and seamless in getting the appointments and services. For my wife without having any exposure to any doctor's review or word of mouth we just got our first consultation with Dr.Poornima M and we stuck to the same doctor till the delivery not because of any gut feel its purely because of her patient friendly nature engaging the patient in explaining \"how important the motherhood and what all efforts it takes to go though the smooth journey plus  the  openness about the delivery procedures\"  finally the humbleness we saw from the first meeting itself gave us confidence to stuck till the end. Today we are extremely happy with Mahalakshmi( Baby Girl)  gave birth in our family , Dr.Poornima M is absolute gem in OAR branch she kept motivating my wife with right instructions, follow ups and explained the every step and procedures very detailed way made us very comfortable and felt like one of the family member.since we din't have any exposure to discuss about the maternity we believed Dr. Poornima M as one of the family member and so did the Doctor by responding quickly to our concerns over just a text message.Dr.Poornima M delivered our first baby in absolute normal fashion, From the day 1 she motivated us for normal delivery ,infact she honestly admitted us saying \" C-Section would be easy for the doctor to complete the procedure\"  however the doctor motivated us till the end for the normal also gave the clarity keeping any complications one should be open to other procedures too. This clarity and detailing i beleive one should be having as it helps during the labor room. As an husband to my wife there were few well informed decisions i had to take during this process and our Doctor explained very clearly the importance of right decision making with logical reasoning behind the decisions to be made during the labor room procedure. It's very natural that most ppl will get panic and go clueless once the patient enters the labor room. Therefore about the decision making being strong but not adamant during the delivery process is extremely important and  I was well educated and informed by the doctor  hence I was very confident and complete calmness was established to go through the pressure situation. The delivery labor room experience itself one can pen down the journey and make it as a short story \ud83d\ude0a as it involved twits and turns , Dr .poornima M consistent motivation towards my wife to get the baby out completely normal without any external additional artificial stuff was the high point in the story. Infact at one point after the 10 cm dilation done my wife almost given up that she couldn't deliver the baby normal she was totally drained out with no energy left which i visibly experienced. I was extremely nervous but kept my complete faith in our doctor , The heroic entry around 3 AM doctor turned to our rescue in the labor room she motivated my wife to give all her energy to push the baby out , but tough luck my wife lost her energy and looked like she couldn't take anymore.Doctor came up with an excellent presence of mind to make her stand 2 feet lil wide open to get advantage of the gravity while again giving deep grunt pushes which worked a bit where baby's hair was visible when doctor again asked my wife to lay down on the bed. What a motivation that time doctor gave i was there witnessing while also i was totally numb but keeping my nerve as I kept saying to myself  \"we are with the best doctor out there\". After multiple pushes by my wife with the lil support from nurse staff one more deep push plus the doctor's very tiny space cut down resulted us in normal delivery coming out Mahalakshmi(baby girl) to this world :\ud83d\ude0aTears automatically came for both of us. Such a great feeling which is unexplainable.The very next day my wife was able to walk naturally and now while i am writing this after 2 weeks of delivery she is back to her original condition.today  both the baby and my wife are doing absolutely  fine. Big Thanks to All the staff who took care of my baby and wife during the entire delivery process. Everything hassle free right from doctor visits ,the food, house keeping ,lactation doctors, nutrition advice , baby care tips, and the vaccine schedule , everything been taken care very systematically and professionally.Also we would like to thank our endocrinology doctor Lakshmi Reddy , she gave the right steps and pointers throughout the pregnancy period to maintain the blood sugar levels and motivated us with right inputs ofcourse she monitored us strictly  and kept suggesting the right techniques to follow.Finally Big Thanks our Doctor Poornima M, what a great human being she is ,always smile on face,very friendly ,jovial made us like one of the family member and took care of us throughout the journey with right inputs.since my wife has special condition of pre diabetic our Doctor planned carefully assessing each and everything and guided us till the end.Due to the diabetic conditions Doctor Poornima M informed us saying \" 37 weeks biologically a baby is ready to deliver and in conditions like diabetes we should be very clear, can't take risk keeping the baby inside mother's stomach till the complete pregnancy period \", Doctor told \"anytime after 37 weeks delivery is possible and gave us the date between 37 week and 38 week as its important to safeguard both baby and mother \". Exactly same thing happenedPrecisely after 37 weeks we had consultation with our doctor and doctor did initial cervical stripping to induce the labor contractions just naturally , there you go after that in few days i had to admit my wife as she was feeling the contractions throughout the day and her water broke  37 weeks 5 days water broke out I rushed to hospital and finally THE biggest gift of my life happened \ud83d\ude0a. Dr Poornima M  you are terrific.Thank you doctor for evrything **** *** *** ********",

Then last year when I conceived, we were visiting another doctor in Cloudnine OAR but were not satisfied with her consultation. We remembered Dr. Poornima from few years back and visited her again and she was still the same friendly and warm doctor with whom you can ask as many questions without being clobbered, which is usually the case with many other doctors.\n\nFrom the beginning of my pregnancy, Dr. Poornima motivated me to go for Normal delivery (when initially other doctors scared me that since I had PCOS and am of short height, Normal delivery is not possible for me). She kept guiding me with appropriate diet plan, medicines and exercise routine to prepare myself for Normal delivery. She is so friendly and approchable that she answered many of my doubts and questions over the phone through out my pregnancy so that I can stay at the comfort of my home without worrying.\n\nDuring the day of my delivery, she visited me at 9 PM and again motivated me that I am doing good and will soon be meeting my baby. I got very tired towards the end and had given up. I asked for C section, but she kept me giving confidence that I can do it. And finally my baby boy was delivered normally. She even prepped my husband during 9 months of pregnancy as to what will happen in the labour room. This set up our expectations and there were no surprises.\n\nEven after delivering my baby boy, she answered many of my postpartum queries over the phone. *** ** *** **** ****** *** *** *** *** *** I am lucky enough to find her for the biggest life event.",

Her dedication and commitment to her patients are unparalleled. She went above and beyond to ensure that I felt safe and supported at every stage, always taking the time to address any concerns or questions my partner and I had, no matter how trivial they may have seemed.\n\nWhat truly sets her apart is, her availability and willingness to assist round the clock. She instilled confidence in me and encouraged a normal delivery, patiently waiting until the very end. Her reassuring presence was a constant source of comfort during what can be an anxious time for expectant parents.\n\nFollowing the birth of my baby boy, she continued to provide exceptional care, visiting daily and ensuring both my baby's and my own health were closely monitored. Even weeks after delivery, she remained attentive, checking in on my well-being.\nI cannot recommend Dr. Poornima highly enough to anyone seeking a supportive and compassionate healthcare provider. Her expertise, kindness, and genuine concern for her patients make her an invaluable asset to any expectant parent. Dr. Poornima truly made my pregnancy journey a positive and memorable experience, and I am forever grateful for her guidance and care.\n\nNitika",

I worked with Dr Poornima during that time as she also recently joined with me give or take a few months. She is a great pleasure to work with. I got a better opportunity in the UK and moved there. I wanted to deliver my baby in cloud nine the moment I was pregnant. While looking up the doctors to get my appointment I saw Dr Poornima, who is now a consultant. I was so happy that I booked her appointment immediately. I told my family about her and they were all waiting to meet her. When I came to Bangalore we visited her as a family and it was a great experience. She was still the same Doctor that I knew who is funny and kind. I wanted a Normal delivery and she was very supportive not only to me but to my family as well and motivated me till the last moment when I was on the labour table. I had a normal delivery finally and she was there by my side throughout. It was a great journey and I loved every bit of it. Me and my whole family are very thankful for bringing us our little bundle of joy safely. She\u2019ll always be in my prayers. Thank you so much ma\u2019am. ",

As my pregnancy journey comes to a joyous end with the arrival of our precious baby, I am filled with immense gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional care and support you provided throughout this remarkable journey.\n\nIn the early days of my pregnancy, I had other gynecologists, and I found it extremely frustrating during visits when I felt rushed, confused, uncomfortable, and even left with questions I still needed clarification on. Choosing you as my doctor was the best decision I have ever made. I received completely different care from you. You have always listened to every single question and concern of mine and have given extremely thorough explanations that I actually understood.\n\nFrom the very beginning, your expertise and genuine passion for your work were evident. Your thoroughness in monitoring the progress of my pregnancy, your attention to detail, and your willingness to address any concerns made me feel confident and well-cared-for at every step. I remember running to Google for every diagnostic result or scan comment and getting panicked; the best advice you gave me was not to Google things but rather to ask you, and believe me, that made my journey peaceful. I know sometimes I was annoying and asked irrelevant questions, but you never lost your calm. That's why I call you my peacemaker ;)\n\nYour approachability around the clock made me feel secure and relaxed; you were always just a ping away for me. The way you explained each thing, be it my food intake, exercise, or even tiny details of my daily routine that needed care, was remarkable.\n\nThe day of delivery was nothing short of extraordinary. You were never in a hurry, as you told me in the beginning that I was going to have a normal delivery. Without your encouragement and support in the labor room, it wouldn't have happened. My family and I are incredibly grateful for the safe and healthy delivery of our baby.\n\nBeyond your medical expertise, it was your kindness and genuine interest in our well-being that made this journey truly special. Your commitment to fostering a positive and trusting patient-doctor relationship has left a lasting impression on us. * *** ******** *** *** *** *** **** ****** * **** **** ************ and I am a patient of yours for life.\n\nThank you, Poornima Ma'am, for being an integral part of this incredible chapter in our lives. Your genuine care has made our pregnancy and delivery experience truly memorable. We feel blessed to have had you as our gynecologist.\n\n*** *** *** ** *** **** ******* ********* *** **** ***** I will HIGHLY recommend you if anyone needs a doctor who listens to their concerns seriously; they will not be disappointed in the care they receive!\n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\nJuhi",

                "review_text": "Journey of Kavyashree , Baby Hithashree \ud83d\ude0aCloud Nine Old Airport branch is absolutely professional and seamless in getting the appointments and services. For my wife without having any exposure to any doctor's review or word of mouth we just got our first consultation with Dr.Poornima M and we stuck to the same doctor till the delivery not because of any gut feel its purely because of her patient friendly nature engaging the patient in explaining \"how important the motherhood and what all efforts it takes to go though the smooth journey plus  the  openness about the delivery procedures\"  finally the humbleness we saw from the first meeting itself gave us confidence to stuck till the end. Today we are extremely happy with Mahalakshmi( Baby Girl)  gave birth in our family , Dr.Poornima M is absolute gem in OAR branch she kept motivating my wife with right instructions, follow ups and explained the every step and procedures very detailed way made us very comfortable and felt like one of the family member.since we din't have any exposure to discuss about the maternity we believed Dr. Poornima M as one of the family member and so did the Doctor by responding quickly to our concerns over just a text message.Dr.Poornima M delivered our first baby in absolute normal fashion, From the day 1 she motivated us for normal delivery ,infact she honestly admitted us saying \" C-Section would be easy for the doctor to complete the procedure\"  however the doctor motivated us till the end for the normal also gave the clarity keeping any complications one should be open to other procedures too. This clarity and detailing i beleive one should be having as it helps during the labor room. As an husband to my wife there were few well informed decisions i had to take during this process and our Doctor explained very clearly the importance of right decision making with logical reasoning behind the decisions to be made during the labor room procedure. It's very natural that most ppl will get panic and go clueless once the patient enters the labor room. Therefore about the decision making being strong but not adamant during the delivery process is extremely important and  I was well educated and informed by the doctor  hence I was very confident and complete calmness was established to go through the pressure situation. The delivery labor room experience itself one can pen down the journey and make it as a short story \ud83d\ude0a as it involved twits and turns , Dr .poornima M consistent motivation towards my wife to get the baby out completely normal without any external additional artificial stuff was the high point in the story. Infact at one point after the 10 cm dilation done my wife almost given up that she couldn't deliver the baby normal she was totally drained out with no energy left which i visibly experienced. I was extremely nervous but kept my complete faith in our doctor , The heroic entry around 3 AM doctor turned to our rescue in the labor room she motivated my wife to give all her energy to push the baby out , but tough luck my wife lost her energy and looked like she couldn't take anymore.Doctor came up with an excellent presence of mind to make her stand 2 feet lil wide open to get advantage of the gravity while again giving deep grunt pushes which worked a bit where baby's hair was visible when doctor again asked my wife to lay down on the bed. What a motivation that time doctor gave i was there witnessing while also i was totally numb but keeping my nerve as I kept saying to myself  \"we are with the best doctor out there\". After multiple pushes by my wife with the lil support from nurse staff one more deep push plus the doctor's very tiny space cut down resulted us in normal delivery coming out Mahalakshmi(baby girl) to this world :\ud83d\ude0aTears automatically came for both of us. Such a great feeling which is unexplainable.The very next day my wife was able to walk naturally and now while i am writing this after 2 weeks of delivery she is back to her original condition.today  both the baby and my wife are doing absolutely  fine. Big Thanks to All the staff who took care of my baby and wife during the entire delivery process. Everything hassle free right from doctor visits ,the food, house keeping ,lactation doctors, nutrition advice , baby care tips, and the vaccine schedule , everything been taken care very systematically and professionally.Also we would like to thank our endocrinology doctor Lakshmi Reddy , she gave the right steps and pointers throughout the pregnancy period to maintain the blood sugar levels and motivated us with right inputs ofcourse she monitored us strictly  and kept suggesting the right techniques to follow.Finally Big Thanks our Doctor Poornima M, what a great human being she is ,always smile on face,very friendly ,jovial made us like one of the family member and took care of us throughout the journey with right inputs.since my wife has special condition of pre diabetic our Doctor planned carefully assessing each and everything and guided us till the end.Due to the diabetic conditions Doctor Poornima M informed us saying \" 37 weeks biologically a baby is ready to deliver and in conditions like diabetes we should be very clear, can't take risk keeping the baby inside mother's stomach till the complete pregnancy period \", Doctor told \"anytime after 37 weeks delivery is possible and gave us the date between 37 week and 38 week as its important to safeguard both baby and mother \". Exactly same thing happenedPrecisely after 37 weeks we had consultation with our doctor and doctor did initial cervical stripping to induce the labor contractions just naturally , there you go after that in few days i had to admit my wife as she was feeling the contractions throughout the day and her water broke  37 weeks 5 days water broke out I rushed to hospital and finally THE biggest gift of my life happened \ud83d\ude0a. Dr Poornima M  you are terrific.Thank you doctor for evrything **** *** *** ********",

Then last year when I conceived, we were visiting another doctor in Cloudnine OAR but were not satisfied with her consultation. We remembered Dr. Poornima from few years back and visited her again and she was still the same friendly and warm doctor with whom you can ask as many questions without being clobbered, which is usually the case with many other doctors.\n\nFrom the beginning of my pregnancy, Dr. Poornima motivated me to go for Normal delivery (when initially other doctors scared me that since I had PCOS and am of short height, Normal delivery is not possible for me). She kept guiding me with appropriate diet plan, medicines and exercise routine to prepare myself for Normal delivery. She is so friendly and approchable that she answered many of my doubts and questions over the phone through out my pregnancy so that I can stay at the comfort of my home without worrying.\n\nDuring the day of my delivery, she visited me at 9 PM and again motivated me that I am doing good and will soon be meeting my baby. I got very tired towards the end and had given up. I asked for C section, but she kept me giving confidence that I can do it. And finally my baby boy was delivered normally. She even prepped my husband during 9 months of pregnancy as to what will happen in the labour room. This set up our expectations and there were no surprises.\n\nEven after delivering my baby boy, she answered many of my postpartum queries over the phone. *** ** *** **** ****** *** *** *** *** *** I am lucky enough to find her for the biggest life event.",

She instilled confidence in me and encouraged a normal delivery, patiently waiting until the very end. Her reassuring presence was a constant source of comfort during what can be an anxious time for expectant parents.\n\nFollowing the birth of my baby boy, she continued to provide exceptional care, visiting daily and ensuring both my baby's and my own health were closely monitored. Even weeks after delivery, she remained attentive, checking in on my well-being.\nI cannot recommend Dr. Poornima highly enough to anyone seeking a supportive and compassionate healthcare provider. Her expertise, kindness, and genuine concern for her patients make her an invaluable asset to any expectant parent.

I worked with Dr Poornima during that time as she also recently joined with me give or take a few months. She is a great pleasure to work with. I got a better opportunity in the UK and moved there. I wanted to deliver my baby in cloud nine the moment I was pregnant. While looking up the doctors to get my appointment I saw Dr Poornima, who is now a consultant. I was so happy that I booked her appointment immediately. I told my family about her and they were all waiting to meet her. When I came to Bangalore we visited her as a family and it was a great experience. She was still the same Doctor that I knew who is funny and kind. I wanted a Normal delivery and she was very supportive not only to me but to my family as well and motivated me till the last moment when I was on the labour table. I had a normal delivery finally and she was there by my side throughout. It was a great journey and I loved every bit of it. Me and my whole family are very thankful for bringing us our little bundle of joy safely. She\u2019ll always be in my prayers. Thank you so much ma\u2019am. ",

She was rude and dismissive while answering my genuine inquiries. I couldn't understand why her consultation, which cost 1000 bucks, was limited to the number of substantial questions only, as she deemed mine irrelevant and baseless. I eventually expressed my dissatisfaction, explaining that I hadn't visited a gynaecologist regularly and wanted polite explanations to my inquiries. Instead, she criticised my age and lack of planning for a baby, comparing me to a 25-year-old's fertility, lack of decision making, etc. Her manner of discussing age-related factors and conception felt like she blamed me for not getting pregnant within my first year and a half of marriage.\n\nInitially, she didn't mention any issues with my menstrual cycle, but when I started asking questions based on the then going discussions, she abruptly claimed that my lack of conception meant I wasn't ovulating properly and I am unnecessarily contradicting her statements by asking irrelevant questions. I politely explained her that I had some doubts and wanted to clarify them by asking her because she's a doctor, and I believed she could help alleviate any concerns. However, she didn't take it positively. Her rude and harsh tone was unacceptable, *** *** ****** *********** ** *** **** **** *** ***** *** **** ****** ** ********* ** ******** ******* The decision to have a baby or not lies with the spouses. I regret visiting this doctor. I explained that I wasn't from a medical background and needed proper explanations for my questions, but she responded rudely, making me uncertain about what I could ask her. She even angrily wrote the prescription because of a question I asked, which upset her. I hope this message reaches potential patients looking for a better doctor through this app.",

She  clear any doubts ,in person or via message at anytime of the day, be it even the silliest of things  which is very comforting for a first time mom.  Appropriate guidance from her each month with respect to diet plan and  exercises helped me prepare and gain confidence in myself for a vaginal delivery. Two days before my delivery procedures were done by the doctor and was assured that things look good for a vaginal delivery . As expected i was ready in 2 days and delivered a beautiful baby girl through vaginal delivery. Doctor was very supportive and helpful that she personally msgd me the previous night asking if things were ok. Thats the kind of personal attention i received from my OBG. Highly recommend her to everybody looking for a good doctor with whom u can place complete trust in for ur pregnancy and delivery journey.",

She clearly explained about the fetal status and its position and any problem with the positions. She encouraged me to have a normal delivery during my labor period. I have not seen any other doctor encouraging for a normal delivery as she did. The words she used at that time made me to feel like a proud mom. Always friendly in nature and answers all our questions clearly even if it is a silly question. With her support and blessings  I was blessed with a Boy Baby.\ud83d\ude0a",

I could deliver normally under Dr Praveena and this team of duty doctors are the reason for my smooth delivery :))",
