Despite the unusual circumstances of going through(I had 3 miscarriages before my Son happened) , he made me feel at ease for the entire length of my pregnancy and delivery.\nHe initially took a thorough look at my heavy, thick medical record(with all that miscarriage history and numerous tests done to us) that I had brought with me from the other hospitals. Primarily, Dr. Kini took his time and spoke to us in depth. I was at peace because I noticed he was trying to take one step at a time and taking everything into a different perspective than what I was told before.   I immediately started feeling very comfortable and confident after a long time of being distressed about possible negative outcomes of my conversations with any other doctors.  I was not scared this time at all..Thanks to his insight and care, I cannot imagine a more supportive, brilliant OBG and Cloudnine is lucky to have him at the helm. \nAll he told us was, forget about the past and soon you are going to be parents!! All he feeds into your head is positivity. He never treated mine as a special case, no extra scans, no extra medicines, no extra tests. he is soo confident that his touch(experience) tells him everything and doesnot require a scan so often .\nHis bedside manner made me feel no longer a patient, he answers all the questions himself without even asking for it.. In each visit he mentions stay positive and enjoy your pregnancy at least a 10 times..\nI had PIH started from 31nd week ,  again his mantra is only to stay calm and take rest.. because of increasing BP In 35th week I had to get an emergency Csec for which we weren\u2019t prepared!! And guess what, his magical hands jus gave us what we were praying for- A Healthy Baby!!!\nWithout a second thought I recommend Dr Kini to anyone who is looking for a hassle free Pregnancy till Delivery.\n",

We do not have enough words to tell the way he has handled our case.\nHe diagnoses the problem perfectly and tells clearly on what must be done. He doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines or scans, but he insists us to stay happy, calm and positive.\nThe very line which always resonates and has helped me the most even now is \"Stop worrying and Start living\". I can never forget this line. Every visit with him was bringing us so much positivity and i thoroughly enjoyed both my pregnancies and gave birth to two lovely kids. His methods are too good specially post C section, I was able to walk on my own the very same day feeding my little one with a happy face, I could return to walking, swimming etc in just a few days after my C section. The best part is the way he involves the husband in the entire process from the start, I feel that is extremely important which brings a big support and with all these there will be no question of postpartum depression. We are too lucky and fortunate to have him as a doctor and again we just can't thank him enough.\n",

Had consulted other doctors before this who said that since it was a big intrauterine fibroid, the uterus itself needs to be removed.  Was quite young with only one 2 year old then. Checked with at least 3 doctors; 2 whom said that it was not possible, one said that she can do it but I need to remain in bed rest at the hospital for  a month. Was not satisfied with this. Then came to  Dr.Kini and never went anywhere else after that. He did the fibroid removal with expert ease; no discomfort of any kind during or after surgery. Was up and about,  ready for a marathon in few hours with no surgery marks as well. Completely trustworthy doctor to whose expertise one can just submit oneself.",

Just right information which you require for your pregnancy. The c section operation was as smooth as he had described and in the evening (after 4-5 hours of operation) I was able to walk.

Despite the unusual circumstances of going through(I had 3 miscarriages before my Son happened) , he made me feel at ease for the entire length of my pregnancy and delivery.\nHe initially took a thorough look at my heavy, thick medical record(with all that miscarriage history and numerous tests done to us) that I had brought with me from the other hospitals. Primarily, Dr. Kini took his time and spoke to us in depth. I was at peace because I noticed he was trying to take one step at a time and taking everything into a different perspective than what I was told before.   I immediately started feeling very comfortable and confident after a long time of being distressed about possible negative outcomes of my conversations with any other doctors.  I was not scared this time at all..Thanks to his insight and care, I cannot imagine a more supportive, brilliant OBG and Cloudnine is lucky to have him at the helm. \nAll he told us was, forget about the past and soon you are going to be parents!! All he feeds into your head is positivity. He never treated mine as a special case, no extra scans, no extra medicines, no extra tests. he is soo confident that his touch(experience) tells him everything and doesnot require a scan so often .\nHis bedside manner made me feel no longer a patient, he answers all the questions himself without even asking for it.. In each visit he mentions stay positive and enjoy your pregnancy at least a 10 times..\nI had PIH started from 31nd week ,  again his mantra is only to stay calm and take rest.. because of increasing BP In 35th week I had to get an emergency Csec for which we weren\u2019t prepared!! And guess what, his magical hands jus gave us what we were praying for- A Healthy Baby!!!\nWithout a second thought I recommend Dr Kini to anyone who is looking for a hassle free Pregnancy till Delivery.\n",

We do not have enough words to tell the way he has handled our case.\nHe diagnoses the problem perfectly and tells clearly on what must be done. He doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines or scans, but he insists us to stay happy, calm and positive.\nThe very line which always resonates and has helped me the most even now is \"Stop worrying and Start living\". I can never forget this line. Every visit with him was bringing us so much positivity and i thoroughly enjoyed both my pregnancies and gave birth to two lovely kids. His methods are too good specially post C section, I was able to walk on my own the very same day feeding my little one with a happy face, I could return to walking, swimming etc in just a few days after my C section. The best part is the way he involves the husband in the entire process from the start, I feel that is extremely important which brings a big support and with all these there will be no question of postpartum depression. We are too lucky and fortunate to have him as a doctor and again we just can't thank him enough.\n",

Had consulted other doctors before this who said that since it was a big intrauterine fibroid, the uterus itself needs to be removed.  Was quite young with only one 2 year old then. Checked with at least 3 doctors; 2 whom said that it was not possible, one said that she can do it but I need to remain in bed rest at the hospital for  a month. Was not satisfied with this. Then came to  Dr.Kini and never went anywhere else after that. He did the fibroid removal with expert ease; no discomfort of any kind during or after surgery. Was up and about,  ready for a marathon in few hours with no surgery marks as well. Completely trustworthy doctor to whose expertise one can just submit oneself.",

But after few consultation, I found that Doctor was not patient friendly, he was not spending not even 5 mins time , to discuss on health issues, to answer any related questions.Instead his responses were rude sometimes.Unwillingly  I did my complete pregnancy check up , but decided to change the doctor for delivery and visited other hospital as I was loosing my hope.It was a bad experience.I will never suggest any one to visit this doctor.",

He asked me to get some test done and then mentioned that everything is fine with me and my husband, we should just try naturally and that within 6 months I will be pregnant. I got pregnant within 2 months naturally :). Entire pregnancy was smooth, no restrictions on diets, exercise or outings. Delivery was even smoother, started walking 3 hours after c-section and when I left hospital after two days I was up and running. No unnecessary test and scans. \r\n\r\nJust found out that I am pregnant again.. and didnt even want to think about any other doctor.. even If I have to drive 30 Kms to other part of Bangalore.. it will still be Dr. Prakash Kini. In my opinion, he is the best doctor ever. All you need to do is listen carefully to what he says. Like the fact that he is a fitness enthusiast and a Doctor you can talk about everything to. ",
