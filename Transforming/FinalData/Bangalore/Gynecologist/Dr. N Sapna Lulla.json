From the beginning she has been a great advisor and till the end. Delivery happened at Aster CMI hospitals and her entire team was very focussed and helpful. Dr Sheetal, Dr Alkeen, Dr Harshini.. special thanks to you all. The nursing staff Saloni, Shivashakti and Mamata were all some good people in the life to remember.. thank you everyone..  For anyone, personally me and my wife would recommend Dr Sapna at any time.\nThe Sapna Health Care Clinic is also very convenient to reach, but parking is a problem. You will be greeted pleasantly by Dr Shipra or Dr Mayuri. Please keep some buffer time to be able meet the best gynaec Dr Sapna.",

She is always available to clarify any doubts via watsapp and answers calls even in her busy schedule.\nWhat we liked the most was her emphasis on natural process, recommends natural remedies rather than going for various procedures.\nShe doesn't scare you unnecessarily during your pregnancy phase , have lot of things / scenario to pen down.\n\nDue to less pain tolerance and my short height everyone including me had an impression that I cannot withstand normal delivery. \nBut she put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Her support , guidance and encouragement during labor was impeccable.\nShe waited till last moment and insisted on normal delivery though we gave up on our hope. \nI never knew that someone would fill that confidence in me which I never had, her smile and positivity will boost the confidence in anyone. \nI will always be obliged to Dr. Sapna, for this as I could not have achieved without her moral support.\n\nShe gave me a different perspective of a doctor as most of them scare us with myths and unnecessary complications though we are healthy. \nShe just insisted to do Pelvic/Kegel exercises ,Squats, walking and sweeping/mopping floor in-order to stay active and healthy.  \nNot much medication she always sticks to natural food supplements. \n\nAdvice to Mom-to-be : If you want to give you and your baby a POSITIVE WOMB EXPERIENCE , blindly go consult Dr. Sapna Lulla without a second thought.Exceptional professionalism, personal care and guidance proves her very special and effective..Doctors like Sapna are truly rare.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my entire pregnancy journey with her and felt so blessed to hold my lil beautiful angel (Normal Delivery) on April 28th in Cloud nine HRBR Layout Branch . God bless her with good health to continue her impeccable service . \n\nOur heartfelt thanks for your care and love . Bangalore deserves more doctors like you Ma'am. A Big Thank you :) \n\nWith Love ,\nAlam & Jyothish and Baby - April Rose :)",

She is easily approachable and she also takes the needed time to update the next steps which gives us a clear sense of direction. She answered all our queries and questions patiently throughout pregnancy and she was also available to clarify any follow-up questions via whatsapp. \n\nUnlike many other doctors who rush through the conception process, she allows the body to naturally conceive and intervenes only if warranted. Same is the case with delivering the baby where she tunes in patients during early pregnancy cycle for normal delivery. We have personally experienced this with her and it is very rare to find a doctor who cares more about side effects and we have never seen her drug me with any unnecessary medication. She is always energetic and cheerful and I have never been so excited in my entire life for doctor visits :D In this generation, pregnancy is being looked at like a 'disease' where everyone gets so petrified and over-cautious but time and again, doctor has re-iterated that this is a physiological phenomenon through her actions - be it with squats, climbing stairs, sweeping, mopping and so on. Because of this attitude, I never missed to do anything during my pregnancy. It was indeed made a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly cherished every bit of it and I owe that to the doctor _/\\_ _/\\_ Infact I should say that mopping and squats that she recommended did play a key role in helping me deliver vaginally (note; I have never mopped in my entire life :P) Also, I would never forget that the doc even permitted me to walk 50k during my pregnancy :) when everyone was against it. I find the doctor very encouraging and due to which I confidently worked till the last day. She has been always available and she told us not to hesitate to call her anytime even in the nights  in case of emergency and she told that she doesn't sleep :( - we have seen her always at the hospital - hope she gets enough time with her family. \n\nOn the day I got admitted for my delivery, I told the nurse to fix IV slowly as I have never done that before. I was completely scared about the entire labor process. In the labor room, I was in tremendous pain and I was clueless how everything will progress. She just swiftly came in within minutes and she was a huge pillar of strength and the moment I saw her, I knew I was in safe hands. She allowed my husband to be next to me. I held her hand and told that there was lotttt of pain. She talked very positively and gave me encouraging words and told that I was doing well (GOK if that was true) but those motivating words did indeed help and I delivered normally in next 15-20 minutes. We strongly believe that this wouldn't have been possible with out Dr. Sapna and we are indebted for life. We strongly recommend her for gynaecology/conception/pregnancy and delivery *** *** ** ****** *** ********* **",

I was on the lookout for a Doctor Who was confident about her decisions and also showed personal interest in me... This is when I met Dr.  Sapna and deciding to continue with her at Ovum hospital was the best decision that my husband and me could take.  From the first consultation onwards,  Dr. Sapna showed a lot of concern and interest in my case as I had developed diabetes.  This did not seem to worry her,  instead she instilled confidence in me from the first day that I could have a healthy n normal pregnancy and could also have a normal delivery.  Dr.  Sapna's sense of confidence in any given situation is the best part about consulting her..  She is a highly skilled,  energetic,  enthusiastic and positive person and she gives a lot of positive energy to the mother to be !\nUnder Dr. Sapna's guidance,  I was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy ... She is always available and accessible, she had asked me to call her at any point of time during the day or at night if I faced any issues...another great quality of Dr Sapna is that she always recommends natural remedies to normal pregnancy related problems. \nI would confidently state that meeting Dr Sapna was a blessing and she alone was responsible for me to deliver my baby normally without any issues...  She always insists on Going in for a normal delivery and prepares the patient on the same lines from the first consultation. \nI would like to thank Dr. Sapna for being there for me and giving me such a warm and friendly feeling,  I would highly recommend Dr Sapna to any mother to be.  I believe that consulting a genuine and good doctor is the best gift that one can give themselves during the crucial period of pregnancy,  and Dr Sapna is one such genuine and friendly Doctor Who can help you do away with all your pregnancy woes.  \nAlso a big thank you to all the staff at Ovum hospital,  it's one of the hospitals where you do not feel unnecessarily nervous or tensed being part of a hospital environment..  The nurses always welcome you with a warm and friendly smile and the hospital staff are generally very courteous and helpful.  They give you a personal touch.  I'd like to specially thank Sr. Blessy, Sr. Sally,  Sr. Mamata all of whom have been extremely warm and friendly and have treated me very well.  \nOverall,  we have had a great time consulting at Ovum.\n\n",

We found one and visited her till 34th week of my pregnancy. I am a healthy person in all means and there were no complients till 34th week. The least thing we want is to leave an unnecessary cut on my body. I am basically a scared women who even is  scared of injection , But , my doctor was always inclined towards c section. \n\nI dont know what 34th week pregnant women will have in her mind but my mind was always busy\nThinking about the unwanted cut on my body . If there is really a need i understand and would go further.Me and my family ,we spent many confused nights and thought of changing the doctor. Finally we wanted a 2nd opinion and went forward and consulted Dr.spana lulla after many suggestionsand discussions \n\nDr.spana lulla , i never knew that someone would fill that confidence in you which u never had. She is  really a dynamic person and explains everything in detail.Even a layman can understand what she says and the best part is she tells what is done to your body which many doctors lack.The most busy doctor who never leaves her smile behind even though she works 24/7 for her patients. The surprising thing is i visited her in 35th for the first time and she dint ask us a single question on why did we changed the doctor in same hospital.\n\nMe and my husband were totally confused and rehearsed on what to talk to doctor the next morning. But the situation became a cake walk because of her. There is no room for unwanted wheres and whys we were accepted as if i am her patient from the start.\n\nI delivered my baby boy on Feb 25th \nAs per our dream to deliver normal and which is never possible without this wonder women. She made a sensitive girl like me to do it. I never thought i can do it. I had to deliver my boy in 37th week as i had blood spotting and was asked to come to hospital immediately. There onwards she asked me to do all the excercises for the normal delivary. Actually on the same day of my delivery she need to fly to deliver one of her relatives. But she never rushed or handed me over to any other doctor. She is very patient and never left me unattended.  She kept monitoring every now and then. At the nth moment as i couldnt push, she helped me to push. I know i irritated her a lot as all i could hear in my hear is \" push navya push\" but i couldn't. I really saw how worried she is when iam not pushing. Even though pain is mine she took entire pressure. I trusted her completely to my life. She brought my tiny naturally without using any instrument.We were\n really moved on hearing when she told my family the reason why she did not prefer using instruments. She told if it is a girl and has a scar on her face she will have to deal with it lifetime. I am very lucky that i have changed my opinion in the nth moment. I never saw such a dedicated doctor.

In medical terms, they call it a pre term delivery or pre mature baby.  Of course. no magic happened and my baby had respiratory problems and was kept in NICU for two days. He recovered completely and is doing great now. I hate to use the term \" pre mature\" as he is very active and healthy.\n\nNow I would like you to know, that my wife had a normal delivery and I had an extremely amazing experience at Ovum hospital with Dr. Sapna Lulla. \nWe started following up with Dr. Sapna starting from the day 1 after the positive pregnancy test. The pregnancy period was not so easy for us. She had a blod clot which was detected in 2nd month of pregnancy. Dr. Sapna took excellent care of my wife, she put her on progestrone and advised to take bed rest. Fortunately, my wife recovered and the baby was completely fine.\n\nLater on, while the 7th month was about to end, due to shortened cervix, we got to know that there was a risk of early delivery. Dr. Sapna advised my wife to just take rest and not stress. While, during this phase, we were just counting and passing days.\nFinally on 11th evening, when we met Dr. Sapna, she diagnosed and asked my wife to get admitted for observation. We were little reluctant as my wife was doing completely fine at this time. However, we completed the formalities of admission and at 9 pm, I went out to grab some food for us. Suddenly, I got a call from my wife that she is having a lot of pain and asked me to return immediately. I reached hospital within 5 minutes, met Dr. Sapna and our baby was delivered at 11 pm.\n\nDr. Sapna, stressed me that she is going to carry out a normal delivery. I was little concerned but I trusted her. She explained me about each and every circumstances and told me not to worry as everything would  be fine. Eventually, every thing was fine. \nI would like to appreciate Dr. Sapna and thank her from the bottom of my heart for whatever she did to keep the baby and Mom healthy. At each point in time, she kept us well informed. Her stress on normal delivery, even for a pre term, went so well. She is a kind of doctor, who never bothered about of how much money she or the hospital  is going to make, rather took care of my wife's and baby's health.\n\nMoreover, the facilities at OVUM were excellent, especially the NICU. I would strongly recommend and advise to consult her during pregnancy.\n\nThank you Ovum and Dr. Sapna(You are awesome).\n\nProud Parents! - Anshuman Mishra & Shilpi Mishra.",

I would not say that her pregnancies are complicated, but there were hiccups for sure. This time, our entire consultation was with Dr. Sapna. \nShe is a very patient person, reads your entire history and always tries to suggest natural remedial measures than putting you on high end medicines. \nMy wife had a fall during her 4th month and she had a spot of retro placental bleed, add to it, the baby's weight was less to start with. With suggestions from Dr. Sapna we did sail through this phase smoothly. \nMy first child was a normal delivery and hoped the same for the second one as well. However, this time around, we had a couple of things in the last trimester, which concerned the doctor if a normal delivery was indeed possible this time. Also, at 33 weeks, the baby was in breech position. \nWith the baby's head circumference being large, it added to the worry if she would deliver normal. \nHowever, Dr. Sapna motivated us a lot towards the last few weeks so that we could have a normal birth this time. Based on her suggestions, which we trusted the most, labour was induced during 38 weeks 4 days. \nDuring the labour the baby's heart beat was hitting a high and the baby was mobile. Even though my wife gave up during the labour and told the doctor to do a c-section, Dr. stood steady,  supported & motivated her to go for normal delivery. Personally, we have never seen doctor's being so involved in labour. With Dr. Sapna, my experience was very different, she was there for every second of 3-4 hours of labour, monitoring the baby's heartbeat. With the support of Dr. Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy weighing 3.8 kgs by normal delivery procedure. I will always be obliged to Dr. Sapna, for this. Now a days, where c-section has become a norm, Dr. Sapna and her team had put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Dr. is also very friendly, peppy, positive and full of energy as a person. She is my elder daughter's best friend. Dr. Sapna, will remain the gynecologist we go to for this life, she is the one who has proved to us tht doctor's are next to God. Thank you Doctor, for making my family complete.",

I got very good feedback about Doctor Sapna from two of my very close friends who were treated by Sapna Ma\u2019am during their pregnancies in 2016. I found equally good reviews on internet as well. So I decided to go with Dr Sapna for my pregnancy treatment. During my initial few consultation appointments with her; I realized that my decision to go with her was correct.\n \nI found Sapna Ma\u2019am very friendly and extremely caring. She\u2019s a seasoned medical practitioner who\u2019s having full confidence on her way of treatment. She knows what\u2019s best for her patients in a given situation. Rather she\u2019s so friendly that she\u2019ll never let you feel that you\u2019re a patient. She\u2019s very flexible and will not prescribe diagnostic tests and medicines un-necessarily and will always encourage you to live your normal life as much as possible rather than taking too many precautions. She\u2019s always approachable and ready to give you right advice even during late night or early morning.\n\nMy delivery experience was also equally calm and relaxed. My first baby was born at Gurgaon - my native place and I was extremely tensed and nervous by that experience which was not so good. \nSapna Ma\u2019am not only gave me enough confidence by assuring me and my child would 100% safe, but also made me feel at ease during the whole process. As she promised, I was totally relaxed & was smiling while entering the operation theatre and came out smiling after giving birth to a healthy baby girl. \nSapna Ma'am was so caring & concerned that during my stay at hospital, she made sure that she\u2019ll make a visit to all her patients once she\u2019s done with her daily job even if it\u2019s mid-night.\n\nMy sincere Thanks to Sapna Ma\u2019am. *** ** *** **** ****** **** **** *** ** ** ****** I would strongly recommend to all my friends and relatives for any OBG related consultation.",

From the beginning she has been a great advisor and till the end. Delivery happened at Aster CMI hospitals and her entire team was very focussed and helpful. Dr Sheetal, Dr Alkeen, Dr Harshini.. special thanks to you all. The nursing staff Saloni, Shivashakti and Mamata were all some good people in the life to remember.. thank you everyone..  For anyone, personally me and my wife would recommend Dr Sapna at any time.\nThe Sapna Health Care Clinic is also very convenient to reach, but parking is a problem. You will be greeted pleasantly by Dr Shipra or Dr Mayuri. Please keep some buffer time to be able meet the best gynaec Dr Sapna.",

She is always available to clarify any doubts via watsapp and answers calls even in her busy schedule.\nWhat we liked the most was her emphasis on natural process, recommends natural remedies rather than going for various procedures.\nShe doesn't scare you unnecessarily during your pregnancy phase , have lot of things / scenario to pen down.\n\nDue to less pain tolerance and my short height everyone including me had an impression that I cannot withstand normal delivery. \nBut she put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Her support , guidance and encouragement during labor was impeccable.\nShe waited till last moment and insisted on normal delivery though we gave up on our hope. \nI never knew that someone would fill that confidence in me which I never had, her smile and positivity will boost the confidence in anyone. \nI will always be obliged to Dr. Sapna, for this as I could not have achieved without her moral support.\n\nShe gave me a different perspective of a doctor as most of them scare us with myths and unnecessary complications though we are healthy. \nShe just insisted to do Pelvic/Kegel exercises ,Squats, walking and sweeping/mopping floor in-order to stay active and healthy.  \nNot much medication she always sticks to natural food supplements. \n\nAdvice to Mom-to-be : If you want to give you and your baby a POSITIVE WOMB EXPERIENCE , blindly go consult Dr. Sapna Lulla without a second thought.Exceptional professionalism, personal care and guidance proves her very special and effective..Doctors like Sapna are truly rare.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my entire pregnancy journey with her and felt so blessed to hold my lil beautiful angel (Normal Delivery) on April 28th in Cloud nine HRBR Layout Branch . God bless her with good health to continue her impeccable service . \n\nOur heartfelt thanks for your care and love . Bangalore deserves more doctors like you Ma'am. A Big Thank you :) \n\nWith Love ,\nAlam & Jyothish and Baby - April Rose :)",

She is easily approachable and she also takes the needed time to update the next steps which gives us a clear sense of direction. She answered all our queries and questions patiently throughout pregnancy and she was also available to clarify any follow-up questions via whatsapp. \n\nUnlike many other doctors who rush through the conception process, she allows the body to naturally conceive and intervenes only if warranted. Same is the case with delivering the baby where she tunes in patients during early pregnancy cycle for normal delivery. We have personally experienced this with her and it is very rare to find a doctor who cares more about side effects and we have never seen her drug me with any unnecessary medication. She is always energetic and cheerful and I have never been so excited in my entire life for doctor visits :D In this generation, pregnancy is being looked at like a 'disease' where everyone gets so petrified and over-cautious but time and again, doctor has re-iterated that this is a physiological phenomenon through her actions - be it with squats, climbing stairs, sweeping, mopping and so on. Because of this attitude, I never missed to do anything during my pregnancy. It was indeed made a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly cherished every bit of it and I owe that to the doctor _/\\_ _/\\_ Infact I should say that mopping and squats that she recommended did play a key role in helping me deliver vaginally (note; I have never mopped in my entire life :P) Also, I would never forget that the doc even permitted me to walk 50k during my pregnancy :) when everyone was against it. I find the doctor very encouraging and due to which I confidently worked till the last day. She has been always available and she told us not to hesitate to call her anytime even in the nights  in case of emergency and she told that she doesn't sleep :( - we have seen her always at the hospital - hope she gets enough time with her family. \n\nOn the day I got admitted for my delivery, I told the nurse to fix IV slowly as I have never done that before. I was completely scared about the entire labor process. In the labor room, I was in tremendous pain and I was clueless how everything will progress. She just swiftly came in within minutes and she was a huge pillar of strength and the moment I saw her, I knew I was in safe hands. She allowed my husband to be next to me. I held her hand and told that there was lotttt of pain. She talked very positively and gave me encouraging words and told that I was doing well (GOK if that was true) but those motivating words did indeed help and I delivered normally in next 15-20 minutes. We strongly believe that this wouldn't have been possible with out Dr. Sapna and we are indebted for life. We strongly recommend her for gynaecology/conception/pregnancy and delivery *** *** ** ****** *** ********* **",

I was on the lookout for a Doctor Who was confident about her decisions and also showed personal interest in me... This is when I met Dr.  Sapna and deciding to continue with her at Ovum hospital was the best decision that my husband and me could take.  From the first consultation onwards,  Dr. Sapna showed a lot of concern and interest in my case as I had developed diabetes.  This did not seem to worry her,  instead she instilled confidence in me from the first day that I could have a healthy n normal pregnancy and could also have a normal delivery.  Dr.  Sapna's sense of confidence in any given situation is the best part about consulting her..  She is a highly skilled,  energetic,  enthusiastic and positive person and she gives a lot of positive energy to the mother to be !\nUnder Dr. Sapna's guidance,  I was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy ... She is always available and accessible, she had asked me to call her at any point of time during the day or at night if I faced any issues...another great quality of Dr Sapna is that she always recommends natural remedies to normal pregnancy related problems. \nI would confidently state that meeting Dr Sapna was a blessing and she alone was responsible for me to deliver my baby normally without any issues...  She always insists on Going in for a normal delivery and prepares the patient on the same lines from the first consultation. \nI would like to thank Dr. Sapna for being there for me and giving me such a warm and friendly feeling,  I would highly recommend Dr Sapna to any mother to be.  I believe that consulting a genuine and good doctor is the best gift that one can give themselves during the crucial period of pregnancy,  and Dr Sapna is one such genuine and friendly Doctor Who can help you do away with all your pregnancy woes.  \nAlso a big thank you to all the staff at Ovum hospital,  it's one of the hospitals where you do not feel unnecessarily nervous or tensed being part of a hospital environment..  The nurses always welcome you with a warm and friendly smile and the hospital staff are generally very courteous and helpful.  They give you a personal touch.  I'd like to specially thank Sr. Blessy, Sr. Sally,  Sr. Mamata all of whom have been extremely warm and friendly and have treated me very well.  \nOverall,  we have had a great time consulting at Ovum.\n\n",

We found one and visited her till 34th week of my pregnancy. I am a healthy person in all means and there were no complients till 34th week. The least thing we want is to leave an unnecessary cut on my body. I am basically a scared women who even is  scared of injection , But , my doctor was always inclined towards c section. \n\nI dont know what 34th week pregnant women will have in her mind but my mind was always busy\nThinking about the unwanted cut on my body . If there is really a need i understand and would go further.Me and my family ,we spent many confused nights and thought of changing the doctor. Finally we wanted a 2nd opinion and went forward and consulted Dr.spana lulla after many suggestionsand discussions \n\nDr.spana lulla , i never knew that someone would fill that confidence in you which u never had. She is  really a dynamic person and explains everything in detail.Even a layman can understand what she says and the best part is she tells what is done to your body which many doctors lack.The most busy doctor who never leaves her smile behind even though she works 24/7 for her patients. The surprising thing is i visited her in 35th for the first time and she dint ask us a single question on why did we changed the doctor in same hospital.\n\nMe and my husband were totally confused and rehearsed on what to talk to doctor the next morning. But the situation became a cake walk because of her. There is no room for unwanted wheres and whys we were accepted as if i am her patient from the start.\n\nI delivered my baby boy on Feb 25th \nAs per our dream to deliver normal and which is never possible without this wonder women. She made a sensitive girl like me to do it. I never thought i can do it. I had to deliver my boy in 37th week as i had blood spotting and was asked to come to hospital immediately. There onwards she asked me to do all the excercises for the normal delivary. Actually on the same day of my delivery she need to fly to deliver one of her relatives. But she never rushed or handed me over to any other doctor. She is very patient and never left me unattended.  She kept monitoring every now and then. At the nth moment as i couldnt push, she helped me to push. I know i irritated her a lot as all i could hear in my hear is \" push navya push\" but i couldn't. I really saw how worried she is when iam not pushing. Even though pain is mine she took entire pressure. I trusted her completely to my life. She brought my tiny naturally without using any instrument.We were\n really moved on hearing when she told my family the reason why she did not prefer using instruments. She told if it is a girl and has a scar on her face she will have to deal with it lifetime. I am very lucky that i have changed my opinion in the nth moment. I never saw such a dedicated doctor. She is the miracle which happend to me.\n\nToday iam very healthy and could look after my tiny without any assistance.\n\nThank you Dr.Sapna. I love u and owe you. ",

                "review_text": "Before I write anything, let me tell you that we had a baby boy delivered 1 month 10 days before the expected delivery date. In medical terms, they call it a pre term delivery or pre mature baby.  Of course. no magic happened and my baby had respiratory problems and was kept in NICU for two days. He recovered completely and is doing great now. I hate to use the term \" pre mature\" as he is very active and healthy.\n\nNow I would like you to know, that my wife had a normal delivery and I had an extremely amazing experience at Ovum hospital with Dr. Sapna Lulla. \nWe started following up with Dr. Sapna starting from the day 1 after the positive pregnancy test. The pregnancy period was not so easy for us. She had a blod clot which was detected in 2nd month of pregnancy. Dr. Sapna took excellent care of my wife, she put her on progestrone and advised to take bed rest. Fortunately, my wife recovered and the baby was completely fine.\n\nLater on, while the 7th month was about to end, due to shortened cervix, we got to know that there was a risk of early delivery. Dr. Sapna advised my wife to just take rest and not stress. While, during this phase, we were just counting and passing days.\nFinally on 11th evening, when we met Dr. Sapna, she diagnosed and asked my wife to get admitted for observation. We were little reluctant as my wife was doing completely fine at this time. However, we completed the formalities of admission and at 9 pm, I went out to grab some food for us. Suddenly, I got a call from my wife that she is having a lot of pain and asked me to return immediately. I reached hospital within 5 minutes, met Dr. Sapna and our baby was delivered at 11 pm.\n\nDr. Sapna, stressed me that she is going to carry out a normal delivery. I was little concerned but I trusted her. She explained me about each and every circumstances and told me not to worry as everything would  be fine. Eventually, every thing was fine. \nI would like to appreciate Dr. Sapna and thank her from the bottom of my heart for whatever she did to keep the baby and Mom healthy. At each point in time, she kept us well informed. Her stress on normal delivery, even for a pre term, went so well. She is a kind of doctor, who never bothered about of how much money she or the hospital  is going to make, rather took care of my wife's and baby's health.\n\nMoreover, the facilities at OVUM were excellent, especially the NICU. I would strongly recommend and advise to consult her during pregnancy.\n\nThank you Ovum and Dr. Sapna(You are awesome).\n\nProud Parents! - Anshuman Mishra & Shilpi Mishra.",

I would not say that her pregnancies are complicated, but there were hiccups for sure. This time, our entire consultation was with Dr. Sapna. \nShe is a very patient person, reads your entire history and always tries to suggest natural remedial measures than putting you on high end medicines. \nMy wife had a fall during her 4th month and she had a spot of retro placental bleed, add to it, the baby's weight was less to start with. With suggestions from Dr. Sapna we did sail through this phase smoothly. \nMy first child was a normal delivery and hoped the same for the second one as well. However, this time around, we had a couple of things in the last trimester, which concerned the doctor if a normal delivery was indeed possible this time. Also, at 33 weeks, the baby was in breech position. \nWith the baby's head circumference being large, it added to the worry if she would deliver normal. \nHowever, Dr. Sapna motivated us a lot towards the last few weeks so that we could have a normal birth this time. Based on her suggestions, which we trusted the most, labour was induced during 38 weeks 4 days. \nDuring the labour the baby's heart beat was hitting a high and the baby was mobile. Even though my wife gave up during the labour and told the doctor to do a c-section, Dr. stood steady,  supported & motivated her to go for normal delivery. Personally, we have never seen doctor's being so involved in labour. With Dr. Sapna, my experience was very different, she was there for every second of 3-4 hours of labour, monitoring the baby's heartbeat. With the support of Dr. Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy weighing 3.8 kgs by normal delivery procedure. I will always be obliged to Dr. Sapna, for this. Now a days, where c-section has become a norm, Dr. Sapna and her team had put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Dr. is also very friendly, peppy, positive and full of energy as a person. She is my elder daughter's best friend. Dr. Sapna, will remain the gynecologist we go to for this life, she is the one who has proved to us tht doctor's are next to God. Thank you Doctor, for making my family complete.",

I got very good feedback about Doctor Sapna from two of my very close friends who were treated by Sapna Ma\u2019am during their pregnancies in 2016. I found equally good reviews on internet as well. So I decided to go with Dr Sapna for my pregnancy treatment. During my initial few consultation appointments with her; I realized that my decision to go with her was correct.\n \nI found Sapna Ma\u2019am very friendly and extremely caring. She\u2019s a seasoned medical practitioner who\u2019s having full confidence on her way of treatment. She knows what\u2019s best for her patients in a given situation. Rather she\u2019s so friendly that she\u2019ll never let you feel that you\u2019re a patient. She\u2019s very flexible and will not prescribe diagnostic tests and medicines un-necessarily and will always encourage you to live your normal life as much as possible rather than taking too many precautions. She\u2019s always approachable and ready to give you right advice even during late night or early morning.\n\nMy delivery experience was also equally calm and relaxed. My first baby was born at Gurgaon - my native place and I was extremely tensed and nervous by that experience which was not so good. \nSapna Ma\u2019am not only gave me enough confidence by assuring me and my child would 100% safe, but also made me feel at ease during the whole process. As she promised, I was totally relaxed & was smiling while entering the operation theatre and came out smiling after giving birth to a healthy baby girl. \nSapna Ma'am was so caring & concerned that during my stay at hospital, she made sure that she\u2019ll make a visit to all her patients once she\u2019s done with her daily job even if it\u2019s mid-night.\n\nMy sincere Thanks to Sapna Ma\u2019am. *** ** *** **** ****** **** **** *** ** ** ****** I would strongly recommend to all my friends and relatives for any OBG related consultation.",

She knows in and out and much knowledgeable doctor. She is so gentle and kind. *** ** *** **** ********* She Patiently allows us to speak/ explain our Our concern and gives us the best solution. Never goes by words, she always gives a best solution based on tests/ reports. Always smiling and her way of talking to you itself will ease all your discomfort and illiness.\nMy story: my co sister had several issues in pregnancy and her previous dr had adviced delivery in 7 months itself but she took a second opinion with dr Sapna and she pushed it till 8 months a delivered baby safely. Since mine was a high risk pregnancy I decided to consult Sapna Lulla, tat was the best decision I made. I never regretted. She was super good in explaining things and in advising the **** solution. One best thing was doctor never hesitated to give her mob number to patients to approach her any time in case of emergency or to share test/ scan reports. She was always there for patient\u2019s help at the tip of the finger. My first baby was preterm from a different dr n in different hospital . But she pushed it till 37 weeks to give birth to a full term baby. Doctor always suggested to call her right away even at mid night in case of emergency. She was the first point of contact for any emergency. She always cares for her patients no matter what. Patients safety is her first priority. I can keep saying about her. She is such an amazing soul/ angel for all the patients. I would have even planned an other baby Just to meet her to get cared by her if I was not done family planning. ",

Since  Sept 2017 to DEC 2017 we consulted her at regular required visits. During initial pregnancy 10 yrs back, I had  issues with Urinary infections during 7-8 month pregnancy period. With that experience, during every  visit to doctor in 2017, we ensured to take a urinary test report voluntarily to know the status of infection & doctor recommended necessary prescription based on the Urinary Test report status. So a pro-active check was kept in this regard continuously from Sep 2017 to DEC 2017. With doctor support, guidance, necessary scanning & prescription, we managed to pull around till 34+6 weeks. Since TWIN A Was in Breech Presentation;TWIN B Was in Cephalic presentation, during this last phase, mode of delivery had to be LSCS only.\nSince the average twins delivery period range is 35-37 weeks and in order to avoid more complications during this phase,  we decided to bring out the twin kids on 01.01.18 at around 2pm. As planned  two twin boys were born on 01.01.18 at around 2.56 pm & 2.57 pm respectively.\nBoth had to be kept at NICU due to prematurity ( 34+6weeks).\nTwin-1 & Twin-2 were at NICU for 9 days & 18 days respectively due to Respiratory Distress; Sepsis; Viral Infection; Jaundice & other minor issues.\nWe were updated on daily basis on the status, progress made on daily basis during this tenure at Hospital. \nWe are very happy on the new born kids recovery, the treatment that the kids received at NICU during the stay  & returning back to home in good health.\nOverall we enjoyed the last 6 months of one time experience in life  of twin pregnancy with Dr.SAPNA LULLA, for consulting, guidance & support till Delivery.\nWe strongly recommend  & suggest to explore for pregnancy( Single/Twins) consultation with Dr.Sapna Lulla at Motherhood Hospital HRBR Laout Bangalore.",

Before I visited her, I was in dillema how was the doctor or whether I will be comfortable with her or not. But when my husband & I visited her I found her she listens patient history entirely & very friendly towards her each patient. She always give less medicines & which are useful but less costly & recommend homely activities i.e., sweeping, moping, walking, etc. She is very proactive, has extremely positive attitude & high confidence. I have learnt many things from her. During critical times how to keep self calm & her positive outlook is really remarkable & I have learnt these qualities from Sapna mam. My entire family is thankful to her. *** ** ****** ** ***** *** ** * ** ******* I was absolutely fine during my pre delivery period but suddenly on the delivery day, I had abruptive placenta & I was profusely bleeding. All of my family members was sure that I was going to have operation because normal delivery was very risky. My husband was mentally prepared about my operation even other medical professionals was sure that Dr. Sapna was going to do operation in this case. *** ** ***** ***** ****** ******** ****** She was very much confident & positive that she is going to do normal delivery in my case. She was with me whole night in the hospital. Her confidence boost my confidence for normal delivery. It was really critical as my placenta got ruptured but I can say Dr.Sapna is a magician or in other terms she is highly qualified professional as she turned impossible delivery happened & that too normal one. And I have delivered my baby last week. She is really normal delivery expert. I can say nowadays if I need any guidance I just approached her. She has patience & always has smile on her face. Everytime I meet her I gained positive energy. Thank you Sapna mam for everything. I would highly recommend Everyone to meet her for any kind of gyaneic related issue. Thanks is really a small word for Dr. Sapna Lulla but Amitava, my family and me (Nandini)are really thankful & grateful to u forever. Last but not least all admin & nursing staffs of Ovum hospital are really friendly & co-operative. I would really like to thank each & every staff of Ovum from bottom of my heart.  ",

By that time I was in a condition of PCOS affected and lost my pregnancy twice (One Missed abortion and one Cornual pregnancy (ectopic) where one of my fallopian tubes was tied and had scars on my uterus) \nDr.Sapna was reviewed my case very carefully and explained us how to proceed for further. Initially she has started giving the treatment for the PCOS. But due to my ectopic surgery, I did have lot of difficulties and the chances were very less to get conceive soon. But with continuous help of Sapna maam and the suggestions she had given make us more confident and comfortable which lead to us a successful twin pregnancy.  \nBut still I was not happy due to one more other problem which concerned me a lot i.e. carrying twin babies. As I had Cornual ectopic surgery & considered my uterus health condition carrying twin babies will put me on more risk and chances are there to puncture the existing stitches again. The thought it self scared me a lot and made me many sleepless nights. Again Sapna maam took responsibility on this issue and supported us for every moment/difficulties we had and make us feel free throughout the pregnancy term until delivery. Now I am also one of the happiest mothers with two baby girls. \nAll this happened because of Dr.Sapna and We really thankful to her for the entire support she has given for us. We do highly recommended her to others for hassle free pregnancy/delivery OR if you have any difficulties to get Conceive.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nSujitharam",

She had normal delivery at Ovum Hospital on January 29th this year.\n\n\nShe has fantastic traits of a good doctor ; High Credentials, ********* ********* ** *** *********** Straight forward and yet empathetic to her patients. Responsive (at any point of time), and most important; almost all her patients love her; including us.\n\nShe would take care of every detail and we were kept well informed at all stages of what to expect and what was going on. The best part of her is that she tries to avoid surgery and as far as possible she tries for Normal delivery which is very rare now a days (at least in our experience with other hospitals and other doctors)\n\nThough my Sister-in-law is differently abled (Deaf & Dumb), doctor spent sufficient time with her to understand her and provide treatment and suggestions with extreme patience. Frankly speaking we ourselves didn\u2019t have a confidence that my Sister-in-law would be able to deliver normally but that\u2019s not the case with Dr. Sapna; From day one doctor was resolute and kept guiding my Sister-in-law to maintain healthy life style which actually helped her to deliver baby normally.\n\n\nIf you are looking for an qualified obstetrician and gynaecologist, you must visit Dr. Sapna Lulla at Ovum Hospital, Kalyan nagar Bangalore.\n\n\nShe is highly recommended ..\n\n\nThanks,\n\nVijayalakshmi",

She recommended me to take up a blood test to understand my \u2018Beta HCG\u2019 count and a \u2018scanning\u2019 to ensure that the gestational sac is visible at the right location.\n\nWhen the reports came in - the pregnancy was confirmed but was an unhealthy one, which they medically call it as \u2018CERVICAL PREGNANCY\u2019 the term which I heard for the first time in my life. To further worsen the situation, mine was a high risk cervical pregnancy where the gestational sac was at the external orifice (OS) of the uterus. The only option available for me was to terminate the pregnancy which was not at all an easy task because of the complications involved. This is where the experienced hand saved my life.\n\nDr. Sapna explained to me the importance of the entire case with great patience and clarity. How she is planning to go ahead with my pregnancy termination process and detailed me about the multiple methods. The best part in her is that she always tries to get the job done with minimal pain and lower risks. The entire process went for a week, but was admitted only for 2 days at hospital \u2013 first day she successfully removed the \u2018sac\u2019 and the second day I was under observation***** ** *** ***** ** *********** *** **** *** ***** *** * ***** ***** ****** She always maintains a pleasant smile on her face not matter whether it is her start or end of the day. Always with high energy level and a great passion towards her profession which is very much evident from the way she explains things, being ready to help at any point in time \u2013 couldn't believe she answered my call at 3.00AM when I started to bleed. She is very practical minded *** ********** **** *** ******** **** ** ** ********** This attitude of her really helped me to be at ease and lighter my problems.\n\nDr. Sapna - Thank you so much for everything, you will be always there in my prayers. Stay gold, keep shining, help as much people as you can \u2013 I am sure you will. I am very blessed to meet you.\nAparna\n",

Right from our first consultation with Sapna mam, and till our child\u2019s delivery, words cannot describe the things mam has done for us (we are the witness, it\u2019s not only for us but for all her patients) . Sapna mam treated my wife with such care and kept us honest on all stages of the pregnancy, and adequately provided us the right support and guidance. One such example is, my wife had pre-term delivery symptoms at 26 weeks, but mam helped us with assuring words and treatments and my wife was successfully able to deliver a healthy baby in term. There were many more complications we encountered during the pregnancy but Sapna mam guided us through all those and ensured we see the happiest day of our lives. Being a doctor is NOT an easy \u201cscheduled\u201d profession as one needs to keep an eye on critical patients, provide consultation to incoming patients etc but inspite of her busy schedule she always makes a point to get back to her patients and do the needful (we have seen mam responding at 3 AM some days).\n** ****** ****** ***** ***** *** ** *** **** ****** *** we pray for her and her family\u2019s good health and success to provide more wonderful services to all in need. With Best Regards and love, Aldo and Capstina\n",

I was very sure that I cannot go for normal delivery and baby will get operated at 9th month since for the diabetic person there is a chance of having a big baby.\n\nFrom my first visit doctor was very patient and was explaining all the complications of a diabetic mother and how to overcome it.. during my entire pregnancy time I am under the watch of doctor for my sugar level. She used to answer my call even at the odd times if my sugar level is getting incerased.\n\nThe happiest part which none of the diabetic mother can have is, I delivered Full Term Baby with Normal delivery at my 39th week.\n\nMy cervix was not dilated and the doctor decided to induce labour for me. She asked me to get admitted in the hospital on Thursday and have first shot of gel to induce the labour. cervix got dilated to 2 cm and again they gave me the next shot of gel at Friday early morning and doctor advised to go for walk so that the cervix will get dilated soon. Around 1Pm I got dilated to 4 cm and took me to labour room.\n\nSoon the dilation got more .During the labour pain all the nursing staffs were there to help me and to encourage me for baring the pain which really helped me a lot.they allowed my husband also to be with me during the labour pain which gave me the support to bare the pain.\n\nI delivered a beautiful baby girl at around 4PM and baby was healthy. This is like a magic which was done by doctor where we all think that normal delivery is not possible for diabetic mother. She proved that it can be possible. my entire family is very thankful to the doctor for the care and support she gave to us. \n\nI strongly recommend all the MOM TO BE to consult  with DR.Sapna for a beautiful motherhood journey.\nThanks to all the Nursing staffs who really cared us a lot.",

At times she would write the sketches and clarify our doubts with patience. During the course of my pregnancy, she motivated and guided us in every step, from food, exercise and even the finance. At the 7th month the baby's weight was less, with suggestions from Dr. Sapna we sailed through the phase smoothly.\n\nAs my delivery dates approached i was normal and healthy, did not experience any pain. However, this time around even in 35 weeks, the baby was way up and doctor explained me to do more exercise ( like sweeping mopping etc..) and do sit ups to help the baby progress down and to get contractions.   \n\nBut the baby did not progress as expected even after 39 weeks, that\u2019s when she advised  to get admitted and to induce labour in order to avoid any complications.\n\nDuring Delivery at Hospital Motherhood HRBR Layout.\n\nDr. Sapana explained us the process of induced labour and timeframe for the baby progress after inducing for normal delivery. She induced the labour in the afternoon on the day we got admitted. Even after trying for almost 2 days the baby did not progress down, so she advised to go for C-section keeping in the view of baby and mothers health.. \n\nEven after deciding and agreeing to go for C-section, Dr. Sapna and her team had put in all the efforts to tried a lot, even waited in the labour room till 2:00am for a normal birth, before going for C-section. Finally with the support of Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy.\n\nThe Hospital staff at Motherhood HRBR layout were very friendly, positive and it felt like our home. The hospital sisters were very friendly and were very to next us and took care of the mother and baby every single minute of the staty. The whole experience at the hospital was like a family get together.\n \nThank you Dr. Sapna and the Motherhood Hospital for all your support and care.\n",

                "review_text": "Pregnancy experience with the Dr Sapna Lulla is Amazing, few things i've to mention here why she is so Special -\n\nShe brainwashed us on delaying/postponing parenthood and having kids later is the biggest mistake in life.\n\nSince the time I got concieved, she took care of me & my baby like a mother. As a first time mother, I & My Dear Husband had many doubts and fears which were clarified with lots of patience and promised all the times with a smile \"Trust me, I'll take care of everything\".\n\nShe always says and believes \"Pregnancy is not a disease, It's a sweet journey / a moment to remember in life and Enjoy every moment of it\". In the entire 38 weeks of my pregnancy, I was not at all on any strict diet. After 3 months of my pregnancy she even allowed us to out-station travel by road / rail transport. Not suggested any special pregnancy exercises like other doctors does, asked me to do the household work & 30 mins walk daily. That's why I never felt I am going through pregnancy disease.\n\nShe did not ask for unnecessary tests and medicens, suggested only required things to prepare for normal pregnancy.\n\nAt 36 weeks my baby weight was almost 3.090kg, still I remember what she said after seeing the reports \"If you feel the  baby weight is a concern and if you're worrying whether normal vaginal delivery happens or not if we wait for few more weeks. If you ask me to do immediate delivery for that, I strictly won't do that until 38 weeks if mother & baby both are doing well. If you are looking for such kind of options, better consult some other doctors\".\n\nShe scolds when needed if there is no co-operation from Mother/Family, but that's all for good reasons :).\n\nShe is reachable all the time and will answer all the queries over the phone / WhatsApp.\n\nThe D-Day experience(Will be remembering for a lifetime) - It's on Sunday evening when I started feeling labor symptoms, I called Dr Sapna immediately and told all the symptoms. She immediately responded even though she is on off duty, and asked us to go to hospital immediately and I'll try to ASAP. She informed to her team clearly what to do before Dr arrives to the hospital. Her team took care of me very nicely, told nothing to worry. When Doctor reached hospital, she said we will wait for another 12hrs to increase naturally the intensity of labor pains. She even visited in-between (around 2am) to check the condition of mine. Finally they shifted me to labor room around 7:45am, after 2 1/2 hrs I delivered a healthy baby boy through normal vaginal delivery. And my baby birth weight was 3.500kg, many of my colleagues didn't believed when I said delivered a baby of 3.5kg weight through normal delivery. And specially I have to mention Dr Swetha who took care of me very well in the labor room, allowed my Dear Husband to stay with  me in the labor when I am in tense.   \n\nThank you Dr Sapna for everything, you brought colors into my life. I wish more and more doctors walk in Dr Sapna's path where a mother can leave all fears about normal delivery because there is nothing greater than natural birth. I strongly recommend Dr Sapna Lulla for all your concerns with pregnancy and delivery.",

She patiently listen our previous case history. We went with pregnancy confirmation check pad, she told to scan immediately for proper closure of uterus in Silver line  scan centre.

She told take Dailycal and orfer xt tablet for calcium, folic acid and iron supplements for entire duration. In 32th week scan she told there is low level of fluid and given supplement sachet for increasing fluid. Once again scan is done on 37th week but fluid level is low further.

With first consultation with Dr. Sapna, we were at ease. \n\nDr. Sapna is quite experienced and clear headed doctor. I guess she is one of the busiest doctor in Ovum. She interacts with patients lively and makes us feel comfortable. She patiently answers our questions. She is very courteous too. She is quite risk avert. She will ask you to go thought most of the standard tests to make sure to know health of the baby and mother at every step.\n\nWhen we were into the 7th month of pregnancy, she gave her personal contact number so that we can directly contact her in case of any emergencies. Let me tell you that she answers our calls at odd hours as she promised. On the day of the delivery also she came down to hospital at midnight (1AM) and stayed till the time of delivery at 8:30AM. She is mostly in favor of normal delivery. During those 7 and half hours of critical, anxious and fearful wait, she kept us updating on the condition of the patient as and when required. She listens to our opinions too during those hours! It helped us to finally have safe normal delivery.\n\nOverall we are highly appreciative of Dr. Sapna Lulla\u2019 s efforts in making our family complete with that smooth delivery of new baby. We wish her all the best for her career ahead at Ovum hospitals.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

That is when we decided to take second opinion from Doctor Sapna regarding this.\nTo start off she was perfect in assessing the problem  for which we had approached her. She checked all the reports and told us we need to do few more test to come to a conclusive result that what kind of surgery needs to be performed and the current state of the problem to be assessed.\nAfter all this most importantly she explained what procedure would be done, the recovery time line and tips to overcome the problems which can be expected during this surgery.\nNow after the surgery we feel very confident that we approached the right Doctor to get this surgery done. DR.Sapna is very calm, approachable, patient enough to listen to us and most importantly very smiling which relives from the pain gone or going through while talking to her.\nPost-surgery she did explain what was done in the OT and explained how the whole procedure was performed in simple terms which was helpful for us to understand.\nA doctor who doesn't see the timings and receives call at any point of time for her patients & representatives for any questions which marks her amazing quality and dedication to whatever she does. She explains in detail what is the best thing in a situation we are & what can be done and needs to be done which brings confidence on the spot.\nOverall it was brilliant experience and would definitely recommend DR Sapna to Family and Friends and also to people who are reading this review and hope this will help you whenever you are looking for a doctor for any similar cases as she has vast knowledge and conducts detailed research before arriving to conclusions.\nThank you Doctor Sapna & her team at Ovum.",

She was the only reason for choosing Aster CMI, which is 30km from our residence n we won\u2019t regret the decision taken.She was the one who gave us the courage to carry our pregnancy stress free and made sure we are in safe hands. Although my pregnancy journey was smooth but I developed PIH at around 32 weeks, which Dr Sapna took care of it and was able to deliver safely on time.\nIt was really a great experience and very rare to find a doctor that combines personal touches and care for patients as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.I highly recommend Dr Sapna Lulla to others.\nThank you,\nDamayanti & Manav",

She is very friendly and good listener. She recognises the problem/health conditions just with a glance and suggest necessary action for it.\nShe made sure that I am very comfortable and not confuse or frightened about any medical condition. She clarifies each doubt, and we asked tone of them. \nShe delivered my second child, a boy baby in Feb 2018 through c-section. My first born was also a c-section birth, throughout my pregnancy she was very confident and reassuring.\nRight up till the end she continued to engage my family, including my 5 year old daughter. Dr. Sapan is a great doctor and in high demand, which also translates to waiting time, but it was worth it. We are very thankful to Sapna and her team.",

She faced severe complications during 3rd month of pregnancy. She had Hetrotropic pregnancy which is rarest of rare. Anyone can browse and check how complicated is this. (A heterotopic pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy in which both extra-uterine (ectopic pregnancy) and intrauterine pregnancy occur simultaneously). Doctor took this situation as challenge and guided us step by step and sorted out all the complications. Also every time we visited, she would give such positive vibes which would make us very confident. She really took care of my wife like a baby. With the days/months passing, Doctor took the right decision to operate at right time. Finally on 29th Dec 2017, my wife delivered a Baby Girl, full healthy. Both mother & baby are now healthy and fine.  We are very thankful to Dr Sapna. I strongly suggest the doctor to anyone who are looking forward for a Gynecologist.\n\nRegards\nVenugopal\n\n",

I found her through online search as I was new to Bangalore and didn't know anyone who can suggest me a good Gynecologist.\n\nWe started visiting Dr. Sapna in another hospital but we moved to Motherhood with her. She is very patient and supportive. She answered all my questions with lot of patience and spent decent amount of time with each patient. \n\nDuring my labor too, she was very helpful and encouraging. Mine was a very fast progressing labor, I guess. She kept all the staff on toes and made them assist me as fast as they can. \n\nThough Motherhood Kalyan Nagar is a new branch and had some initial start-up infrastructure issues, she made sure that everything is on place for safe deliveries, normal or c- section. \n\nThe best part is, Dr. Sapna always tries to encourage normal delivery by making us work (physically), though some feel it's very tiring during pregnancy. She made me walk, take stairs, squats and encouraged me to do all household work, ultimately I ended up with a safe and quick normal delivery.\n\nI can't express my gratitude towards her with just a THANK YOU.\n\nI strongly recommend visiting her for your pregnancy related issues.\n\nThank you Dr. Sapna for your support.",

Her experience and judgement helped us manage our IUGR ( intra uterine growth retardation) baby and take timely decision on delivery date. I hope my feedback helps people with high risk pregnancies and other complications while choosing a gynaecologist.  First thing I noticed about Dr Sapana was her consultative rather than patronising style of interaction. She encourages discussion and explains well while paying personal attention to her patients. She has a calming and cheerful presence and managed my fears, worries and doubts well. She took very good care of me pre and post Nataly, was always 'just a call away'. This easy approachability was very reassuring for me.\nShe also understands financial implications of unnecessary tests, investigations and hospital admission and maintains a good balance. I would sum up by saying that Dr Sapana is a competent professional who is expert in management of high risk pregnancies and preg related complications while following 'good practice' guidelines. I had first trimester bleed, pre term labour, and IUGR baby but with her expertise , support and encouragement, I could carry till 36 weeks and am a period patent to a healthy 7 weeks old baby. All the 'waiting area' waits were worth it!! ",

In the first meeting only I was sure that I am in safe hands and she is the one who can really help me.  Dr. Swapna makes her patients very comfortable and explains everything in detail.  It was only because of her which made my pregnancy really smooth. In the 5th month I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She took care of my sugar levels very well.  She was always there in every thick and thin times. She always stands by her patients, not only as a doctor but as a friend, as a counselor and as a well wisher too. In this corporate world You find very few doctors who are devoted to their profession and who believe in service....  Dr. Swapna Lulla is one of them. \nI am really blessed to find a doctor like her. I am really thankful to Dr. Swapna Lulla for being there as a support system for me.  \nI would highly recommend Dr. Swapna Lulla to all the patients out there who are in search of a good doctor. *** ** *** **** ************ ** *** ******  ",

I had taken treatment for the PCOS and had conceived naturally.\n\nI continued my consultation with her through out the pregnancy term. She had been very supportive and very patient.\n\nBefore delivery there were many fears in my mind for the pregnancy term, postpartum care and the pain of delivery. \n\nI had a C-section, after labor was induced as the baby heart beat was fluctuating and dipping due to lack of oxygen supply. Doctor informed us that it would be a emergency C-section.\n\nMy husband had accompanied me in the operation theater. The baby had water in her lungs at birth, as she started breathing inside the womb due to lack of oxygen supply to the baby.\n\nThe baby was shifted to NICU immediately and was there for almost 48hrs, we felt low but kept our hopes and didn't panic for the babies condition.\n\nThe good care of the hospital staff inside the NICU and even outside the NICU for myself and baby ensured that our baby doll was completely fine. \n\nHATS OFF TO THE DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL FOR THE CARE TAKEN OF THE NEWBORN AND NEW MOM.",

I had been to Ovum in my 9 th month. It was my first pregnancy and I didn't have any complications throughout, as per my scan at 37th week my dew date was 10 th of October. Though I had 3 weeks time I was regularly in touch with Dr Sapna as instructed by her. She went through my history and suggested regular exercises. She explains in a very clear manner which made easy for me to understand and implement. She never delayed response wen ever I gave her a call. \nI consulted her in the morning as I was consistently getting pains, she checked and suggested for NST then the process started as the contractions kept increasing. Pregnancy and labour is unpredictable process, I was all nervous but she kept me on with her positive vibes until the baby was born. I gave birth to a boy baby at 10 pm on 27th sep, next day by evening i was discharged and was suggested for regular check ups.\nUndoubtedly felt safe in the hands of Dr. Sapna at Ovum.",

From day 1 - she's been guiding us, the do's and dont's, what to eat and what not to, in conjunction with regular consultations, amidst these pandemic times. You know you're consulting with the right person when you're asked not to subscribe to any fancy packages from fancy hospital chains - we will 'both' (Doc and us) work together towards a normal delivery - a rarity. Doctor gave me a lot of confidence throughout my pregnancy. We've had the pleasure of calling up and pinging her at odd hours, about this niggle or another - we were however, dealt with politely and advised appropriately of what's OK n what's not. Mind you, we were given the freedom to call n inquire about any discomfort n this did arise after midnight n fortunately, we were not brushed aside but were immediately called for a check up, turns out, we had to rush to our chosen hospital - Dr Sapna arranged for everything while we were enroute n lo-behold, our son was born the same night. She has helped us bring a new life into this world - a naughty, pooping, irritating and yet, joyful and a loving son..! We cannot thank her enough for this gift of life..!",

I would first like to extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Dr.Sapna for her constant support in helping me have a safe and normal delivery. We have been consulting Dr.Sapna from the very first month of my pregnancy. My husband and I always dreamt of delivering our child normally and our dream came true only because of this wonderful doctor who worked miracles for us. I had an issue with my water levels from the beginning of my 9th month and was able to pull off till the end of the month only with Dr.Sapna's continuous monitoring and treatment. She encouraged us to stay positive at every phase and ensured that we smoothly sailed through the last month till delivery. She maintained transparency and and educated us about every course of treatment. Her patience and dedication towards her patients and profession is commendable. A doctor who is so passionate towards her profession is hard to find and I'm really grateful to our friends (Vishal & Shilpa) who recommended Dr.Sapna to us. \nWe are forever indebted to her for her selfless service. Thank you doctor for being a blessing in disguise and an advocate of God in bringing our bundle of joy to this world.\n\nBlessings to you and your family :) (Sapna Healthcare Family - Meenakshi, Rachel & Sushma for being so patient and supportive each time we made a visit to the clinic - God Bless)\n\nA big thank you from baby Christine Rachel, Simon & Monisha",

At the same time, she is very diligent in monitoring the foetus health. I was really amazed by the fact that she sees so many patients every day and yet remembers details about me during my visits. Her counseling helped me to come out of depressing state of mind too when i had the complications like subchorionic bleed & placenta previa. By the grace of god and with the great support by Dr. Sapna, now we are enjoying our new life as parents with our 3 month old baby girl. She will always be in my prayers. God bless Dr. Sapna & her family.I highly recommend Dr. Sapna to all those couple who are looking for a normal delivery & trust me you wont regret. She is such a gem !",

Dr is very friendly and her positive approach in all the situation has made me stronger. From the time of pregnancy till delivery Dr was very helpful. I had fibroid issue and Dr said it is a high risk pregnancy but Dr helped me with a normal delivery. From the time of pregnancy till delivery I was scared and not cooperative enough Dr had enough patience to tolerate me and successfully help me with a normal delivery I want to thank Dr from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much Dr me and my baby is fine and doing good because of you. Not only me my family and my husband is also thankful to you from their bottom of the heart. Anyone can definitely just close your eyes and select a Dr where even if you feel down Dr's positive approach will make you stronger. I still feel it's a dream me giving a normal delivery where initially I used cry for sexual intercourse. Once again thank you Dr",

Dr Sapna delivered my second child, a girl baby, in October 2017 through C section. My first born was also a c section birth, and though both doctor and I were keen to wait for a normal birth, (the doctor more so than I) for many unforseen events and having passed the 40 weeks mark, I asked her to operate. Throughout my pre and post natal care she was friendly, confident, ************* and very reassuring. I never felt patronised or heard her make any condescending remark. She always heard us out thoroughly, never rushed us or made us feel unimportant. Right up till the end she spent a few minutes engaging us and our older child in conversation. Though visiting her often required much waiting since she is a doctor in high demand, it was worth it in the end to see her smiling face and easy manner that gave u the necessary boost to continue happily in the pregnancy and to take pleasure in it. We are very grateful that she held our hand through this process and helped guide us towards becoming 2nd time parents.",

I was going through many hardships during my early pregnancy. Dr. Sapna treated me and gave me confidence to come out of the difficult situation at many instances.\n\nEven though, my first baby was through C Section, she was still trying till end for the normal delivery as there was enough gap between my first and second baby. However, we had to take a call for C section as contractions were not developed and baby was nearing full term.  There were some unexpected complications experienced during my C section and she handled it very well and also highlighted the need of taking special care of the baby to the Pediatrician/ NICU. \n\nPost-delivery, she continued to provide good advises to overcome the pain and other problems, I was going through. In fact, at difficult times, she had provided advice/treatment over Whatsapp in odd hours.\n\nShe is a very humble person and treats her patients with respect and  becomes your partner in your journey of Motherhood. She is very passionate and professional about her job. Overall, a great experience and association with her.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Sapna\n",

From the first visit our consultation was satisfactory and we gained confidence in each visit. The only good thing i personally liked is her way of approach and explanation. Whether it may be a normal or a complicated issue many doctors lack in the way it has to be explained but she is worth it!  By the god's grace my pregnancy period was normal and didn't had any trouble. Even when she moved to a different hospital we didn't change our track. Unfortunately i didn't go to labor till my 39 weeks and finally got admitted. From the time i got admitted i had belief on this doc as she would keep me safe. I was finally blessed with a baby boy under the supervision of Dr. Sapna and her team by C-section. Even when the doctor explained the complication to my better half she portrayed in a right way which made us get convinced. Cutting it short i would give a thumbs up to this lady and i would recommend everyone. ",

Though I was not very sure about moving to a new hospital that was in its setting up phase, it was the confidence and trust that I had in Dr Sapna that helped me take the decision to shift. And I must mention that Doctor made sure that everything was in place and I got the best of what was available at the hospital. Her early morning visits ( 4 in the morning!) just to make sure that everything was ok , itself shows her concern for her patients. \n\nDr Sapna\u2019s friendly attitude and commitment to her profession is commendable. Based on my experience, I would strongly recommend Dr Sapna to my family and friends!",

In times where most of the gynaes are hand in glove with hospital to churn out c-sec deliveries one after another enriching their coffers , she is a class apart in terms of her humane and considerate approach towards patients. Our first baby was born as an emergency C section at 32 weeks because of IUGR and we were expecting our second baby on the same lines. *** *** ** *******  ********** ****** the pregnancy went untill 39th week and were blessed with a healthy baby boy on 19th Sept'17. Even though it was a C sec which was medically necessitated as the baby had pooped, she left no stone unturned until the very last moment to do vaginal delivery. Her sweet demeanour and patient centric attitude is a rare trait which she is blessed with in abundance. We strong believe just a single visit to Dr Sapna, will get you a doctor friend for life.....

My birthing experiences with Dr. Sapna consulting at Ovum Hospital  has been excellent, we had no doubts in her skills, expertise and care from day one,not once did i feel that i should have had a different doctor. One of the best qualities i liked about her is that she has lot of patience and listens to all our concerns, she does not give lot of unwanted supplement tablets. She believes in normal delivery and will not suggest c-section unless its the need of the hour. My experience with her  has been excellent i thank her for helping us complete our family and trust me i am already looking forward to having  a second baby when the time is right. ******* **  ******* **** ***** ********** ** ** ************** * ****  ***** ** ***** **** * *** ******* **** *** ** ***** **** *** **  *** ** *** **** ** *** ********* Thank you so much Dr.Sapna for not only being a good doctor but also a good friend.

My journey of knowing Dr Sapna started when I first visited her for PCOD, though it was initial stages i was still dreading conceiving but all my meetings with Dr Sapna were so assuring and motivating. She always made things easy for me by assuring me that things would be fine. and luckily right through the beginning till today things did go fine.\nShe is the only Doctors I have seen in Bangalore who always wanted to treat me naturally than prescribing medicines. All our visits she made us feel like we were talking to a family member. She is very approachable and always has a smiling face which makes things so much easy. I would have never carried a normal delivery if not for her motivation right through the beginning. I rem she did not give up on me right till the end and made sure I have a natural delivery procedure. I am thankful God first then her for helping me deliver a healthy and beautiful baby girl. I would definitely recommend Dr Sapna if you would like to have a hassle free and most importantly a normal delivery.\n\nI would def visit her if i plan to conceive again.",

Best part about Dr. Sapna was that she didn't give me more medicines and did listen to all my concerns very patiently. She explains all the concerns very  peacefully and make sure that me and my husband understands and become confident to overcome those. Me as a first time mother had lots of doubts and sometimes they were really silly. Dr. Sapna handled all those very patiently. I was very particular on giving a natural birth from the beginning. Dr Sapna gave me all the confidence throughout my pregnancy to have that. And finally I naturally/normally delivered a cute baby girl under her observation. Me and my baby both are doing great now. Me and my family are very thankful to Dr Sapna.",

She is a very patient person, listens and answers all our queries we have. She would even go to the extent of clarifying your questions on whatsapp. \n\nMy first child was a normal delivery and we hoped the same for the second one as well. However, this time around even in 35 weeks, the baby was in breech position and doctor explained how dangerous it would be for the baby if she goes for a normal delivery considering the weight of the baby. So she advised to go for C-section\nWith the support of Dr. Sapna and her team, we did deliver a healthy, beautiful baby boy weighing 3.1 kgs. Dr. is also very friendly, positive and full of energy as a person. She always has a big smile and positive attitude which gives us the much needed confidence. Thank you Doctor and the Ovum Hospital for all your support and care. ",

Went into labour as per her advice. \nWe were almost sure that it's going to be a C-section, she assured me that she would try everything she could for a normal birth and she did! \nWe're now blessed with a beautiful baby girl, had a normal delivery. \nEvery time I look at my baby and thank the Gods, I keep Doctor Sapna in my prayers. \nMy only regret is that I couldn't spend my nine precious months with her. ****** ***** ***** *** ****** ******",

She is excellent in her profession, experienced in handling complex cases. She is very caring and listens to patient's concerns patiently and calmly. She is cool minded and always keeps her patients relaxed. One concern which now a days everyone has in their mind while consulting any doctor is usually they recommend unnecessary medicines and tests.With Dr Sapna and Ovum hospital you can be rest assured that this is not the case. She recommends only the required tests and medicines. \nShe does her best to have a normal delivery for her patients. For us she awaited for several hours so that to have normal delivery.\nComing to Ovum hospital service, the staffs are very courteous and helpful.

Every scan I was asked to do said I have fibroids but all the doctors (prior) said not to do anything with them. It was when it became unbearable for the last couple of months that I wanted to visit a new doctor. I am only thankful that I came across Dr Sapna Lulla, she not only gave me the right picture on what needs to be done but also was extremely positive about how this had to be handled. She suggested that I undergo Myomectomy, an open surgery to remove my fibroids which had now grown really big. What I admire the most is that before suggesting this, she took personal interest in discussing this with other doctors to ensure that this was the best possible way of dealing with my fibroids. Since my husband and I have blind trust and faith in her, we went ahead. I had my surgery done on 5th May\u201916 at Ovum and was thoroughly impressed by the hospital services as well as the staff. It\u2019s a great hospital which takes good care of their patients and also positively responded to all our queries/needs while in the hospital. I now refer Dr Sapna to every person I meet, for me she\u2019s the best doctor I have met so far in Bangalore. She takes great care of her patients and also knows how to cheer them up & make them feel comfortable when they need it the most. For me, it\u2019s only Dr Sapna for my future pregnancy and Ovum hospital for my delivery. ",

One evening 4 days before my EDD we visited Dr Sapna for a regular check up and she noticed a very subtle drop in the heart beat of the baby. The nurses and the Doctor spent close to 2 hrs checking and re-checking to make doubly sure they were seeing it right. I dont know of any hospital that offers such huge amount of personal care. Since it was evening and there was no scope of doing an Ultrasound to see how the baby was, Dr Sapna purely based on her experience guessed that the umbilical cord may be around the baby's neck causing the fall in the heart beat. She suggested an emergency C-section. When we agreed to that the hospital took less than 20 mins to get the entire team of doctors and anasthetist etc for doing the surgery even though it was late at night. It turned out to be exactly how the Doctor had guessed. The umbilical cord was around the baby's neck and legs and her fingers were digging into the cord. It took a whole lot of intelligent effort by the team to deliver the baby safely. If the doctor wouldnt have made that critical decision I do not know how the baby would have been. Thank you so much Dr Sapna...we will always be grateful to God and to you for our baby...",

She is someone who is extremely passionate about her field and will always go the extra mile for her patients. Dr Sapna is not just a great doctor who is well versed in her field but also comes across as very friendly and motivating for her patients. You will always feel safe in her hands and comfortable knowing she will do all it takes to ensure you and the life growing inside of you are safe. I had a safe delivery with Dr Sapna which started out as a normal delivery and then due to complications ended up as a C-section, she ensured that the baby and I were safe at the end of it. Also she is someone who insists that one goes through with a normal delivery, will only go to c-section if medically needed. All in all it has been a great 9 months consulting with Dr Sapna, I would highly recommend her for all expecting mothers. Thank you Dr. Sapna for helping us bring our bundle of joy into this world !!",

So many things we can learn from her\ud83d\ude0a. Every time we came out of the consultation there is a sense of order and clarity in our thoughts on our condition. She is very informative, frank and a great communicator which even my grandma can understand. This will make the pregnancy journey so calm and manageable (I would not say easy as there are so many things and situations which is definitely not easy in any case of pregnancy)\n\nAfter an overnight labor in the maternity ward while we had her inputs continuously all night on our phone and through the duty doctors at the ward, when the last stage was about to begin, we had Dr Sapna come to the hospital in the wee hours, I think it was like 4:30 AM or so. Being an experienced doctor she performed and oversaw the whole delivery process like a champ. Even though it took like more 45 mins or so, the whole team headed by Dr. Sapna ensured that the normal delivery was achieved! And now we have a healthy baby girl\ud83d\ude0a\nThank you very much Doctor \ud83d\ude0a",

The checklist on vaccination and timely tests during pregnancy\n5. Decision making and driving it to perfect finish\n6. Patient First Approach\n7. The way she listens and teaches junior doctors/surgeons!\n\nSuch positive vibes around her, make patients calm and positive to go back to her and talk about their problems (including silly questions regarding health) comfortably and seek suggestions and required support.\n\nThe doctor is well connected and concerned about the patient's physical and mental health during pregnancy or any genealogical related problems.",

Her bright and energetic personality immediately made me feel comfortable the very first time I visited her. She answered all my questions very patiently (even the silly ones). She was also very accommodating about the fears and concerns that I had regarding pregnancy. Her support made me feel more confident through the tough pregnancy and my pre existing health conditions. Apart from handling my health related issues, she also communicated with the hospital staff and made sure that my emergency delivery was performed in a very smooth manner without any stress or tension. She has her own team of doctors who accompany her wherever she performs the delivery- this made me feel much more confident that I would be well taken care of. She is very clear in her explanation of the situation and if the patient's condition requires immediate attention she ensures that she takes necessary steps to sort things out instantly. Dr. Sapna is always reachable on the phone and also replies to questions on WhatsApp. Apart from being a thorough professional, Dr. Sapna is also very considerate towards her patients and does her best to help them in every possible way. It is really important to have trust in one's doctor and to feel comfortable in asking any questions that one might have and I'm really glad that I met Dr. Sapna. Thank you, Doctor!",

The doctor did understand her situation helped us in every way she could during my wife's critical months and helped us in all ways namingly , attending us with priority for regular check-up as sitting for long was not good for my wife's health , advising the right time to get hospitalized whenever there could be a risk of some mishappeninng , how these  additional expenses due to the critical situation can be as less as possible with no compromise on health related required treatments etc etc\n\nWe had an idea that there could be serious complications in the process but she managed the operation very well and things are under control now. She has been a saviour and  her skills, extra care , dedication and regular support has helped her get off from a life and risk situation and finally we blessed with baby boy.\n\nOnce again lots of thanks to her and I would sat that its will be sincere recommendation to others to consult Dr. Sapna atleast once and she will ensure you will have a smiling face at the end.\n\n\n\n\n",

I came to bangalore during the 4th month of my pregnancy and decided to consult Dr.Sapna based on her rave reviews on practo. I must say me and my husband were happy with our choice from the first consult. She is very friendly,  down to earth,  does not like to prescribe medicines unless absolutely necessary.  At the same time,  she is very diligent in monitoring the foetus health.  I was really amazed by the fact that she sees so many patients every day and yet remembers details about me during my visits. Since my lo's growth was not proportionate (based on growth scans),  during the 39th week,  labor had to be induced.  After 12 hours I was still not dilating and hence dr decided to go for c section (baby's heart beat was little erratic at that point). The surgery was uncomplicated and she kept talking to me throughout.  She even explained to my relatives waiting outside on why we had to go for C section. Post delivery,  she helped me alleviate my fears when I had low milk production (in the initial week)  as well. ",

She mostly focuses on natural remedies like getting nutrition from food rather than taking supplements. Her focus on getting a normal delivery is commendable, she will prepare you mentally and physically for a normal delivery. She guided me and did regular check on me during my entire labor pain. In fact she was in the hospital the entire night (when I was admitted with labor pains) and the following day without a break. The foetal heart rate was personally monitored by the doctor continuously for over 10 hours since there was a drop in it and eventually she succeeded in giving me a normal delivery. Such level of dedication and commitment from such a senior doctor is really commendable. I consider myself lucky to have found Dr. Sapna (recommended by a friend).\nShe also counselled me post-partum when I was going through some emotional distress. Thanks a lot doctor. My husband and I are really grateful to you maam.",

I was faced some Placental insufficiency and Fetus Asymetric IUGR on 8th month of pregnency.In this situation  Dr.Sapna showed a lot of concern and interest in my case.Later She switched to Cloudnine hospital and we are also decided to continue with her at Cloudnine hospital. Dr. Sapna's sense of confidence in any given situation is the best part about consulting her.. *** ** * ****** ******** energetic, enthusiastic and positive person and she gives a lot of positive energy to the mother to be ! Another great quality of Dr Sapna is that she always recommends natural remedies to normal pregnancy related problems.\n\nDr.Sapna is always available and accessible and told me to call her at any time(day or night) if I face any issues.\n\nI am truely and confidently saying that meeting doctor Sapna Lulla was a blessing. She is such a genuine and friendly doctor which I have never seen. \n\nI would like to thank Dr.Sapna being there for me and  I would highly recommended Dr.Sapna to any mother to be.\n\n",

We thank her for comforting us at all times and taking away all our stress.\nBe it precautions at various stages of pregnancy, or tips to prepare for the D-day, with a smile on her face she helped us to bring our little bundle of joy into this world via normal delivery. As this was our first experience, we had our own apprehensions about normal delivery as baby weight was more, however she convinced us and prepared us mentally for the delivery.\n\nThank you is not enough for all the efforts and commitment put in by her. She was always available on phone, whats app at the time of need for our questions, reports, or for any issues. Her presence during labor and delivery was very comforting and encouraging. \n\nDr Sapna Lulla rightly prooves that \u201cDoctors are living Gods\u201d.",

At that time, we did not know that we did the best possible thing.  Dr.Sapna Lulla literally did MAGIC.  We had an absolutely smooth journey for 38 full weeks, after which my wife delivered a baby boy NORMALLY under the personal supervision of Dr.Sapna Lulla on the most auspicious day of Sri Krishna Janmastami.  What more can we ask for?  It has been a totally pleasurable experience with Dr.Sapna Lulla preempting and preventing all the possible complications.  I have no second thoughts in strongly recommending Dr.Sapna Lulla to each and every prospective mother.  It is amazing that Dr.Sapna Lulla thoroughly enjoys her severely demanding schedule that makes her run up the stairs every other day (rather every other morning/afternoon/evening/night) to attend to an impending delivery.  Thanks to the passion and love of Dr.Sapna Lulla for her profession, we are happy parents of a baby boy, whom everybody is suggesting to name as KRISHNA.",

We may never be able to express how grateful we are for this. As you said - \u201cThere is always a time for everything.\u201d\n\nThe process of conception being a struggle these days, the very basic thing that any patient longs for, is for her to have a stress free relationship with her doctor during consultations and procedures. You have never failed us in this aspect. Your way of handling your patients to keep them in a comfort zone by patiently explaining the procedures, clearing doubts and addressing fears at each and every step and being available for any urgency gives a personal touch - just what we need. With Dr. Sapna, even painful procedures can be undergone in an almost painless way. \n\nWe are half way through our journey to becoming parents. Thank you so much Dr. Sapna, we are so happy to be associated with you in this journey and look forward to experiencing one of the best moments in our life with you in the coming months. \n\nThanks loads,\nJanani and Siddharth ",

Doctor guidance and patience to wait for pain to start normally and early intervention helped us in having a normal delivery with a healthy baby as she said. \n\nPeople need to have patience when they visiting doctors, sometimes we may have to wait little long hours, sometime appointment may get cancelled due to emergency cases. Most of the time doctors work continuous shift.  \n\nThanks a million Dr. Sapna Lulla for all your support and care.\n",

After all the research, reviews and opinions, we decided that the right doctor will help us go a long way through. That was when we heard of Dr. Sapna Lulla. I\u2019m generally a person who doesn\u2019t believe in people casting opinions on social media on gynec consultation and delivery. After talking to many patients and doctors, we banked on Dr. Sapna! I would say for any doctor /patient - the trust factor is very crucial. This was mutual in this case! Like all would-be-parents desire, we too wanted a normal delivery instead of cesarean. And that was a long shot though! \nDr. Sapna\u2019s calmness and experience played a pivotal role. The patience-level and the rapport built over a period of time was magnificent. Her skill of assessing the patient\u2019s body condition and the art of following a particular process impressed us a great deal. \nHer service and experience at the time of delivery made us feel on top! Thanks to Dr. Sapna for keeping up her promise of a normal delivery and we are happy parents now! \nI would certainly recommend Dr. Sapna Lulla to anyone who\u2019s wanting to consult for gynec consultation, pregnancy and delivery.\nAll the best to the ones seeking help from Dr. Sapna! I\u2019m sure you would end up being delighted - like we are.",

She has helped my wife to deliver a healthy baby in 2 hours of labour. She made sure that it was normal delivery and that our baby was a term baby. During 35 weeks the water level went low and baby movements were less, but she resolved it through medications making sure that the baby crossed 37 weeks and that the baby was not Preterm. We are very thankful to her for this effort she has taken. She is very dedicated to her profession and a very strong woman. She is thoughtful, caring, knowledgeable and all time smiling, approachable and friendly doctor. She helped my wife, to set a confident mindset throughout her pregnancy journey. \n\nMotherhood hospital provided good facilities. The staffs always greet us with a smile. We are thankful to God for giving us this experience with a good hospital and an excellent doctor. I would sincerely recommend everyone to consult Dr. Sapna N Lulla for any gynecological problems. *** ** *** **** *** I am sure she is soon going to be awarded for her dedication!

Her timely advise and \u201cPep-Talks\u201d has not just made my wife be physically fit during her pregnancy period but she supported her to be prepared even more psychologically. Despite of having a fibroid, the doctor was always confident about a normal delivery. All her efforts did lead to a \u201cNormal Deliver\u201d (yes, you read it right) of a beautiful princess on 16.01.2018. She is a person of high integrity who has always kept the convenience of her patient on priority even more than her own. \n\nThanks to the hospital staff at Motherhood too, who were working equally hard to complement the efforts of Dr. Sapna in offering a positive customer experience, in the true sense of the term.\n\nWe agree that there are numerous qualified doctors in the city who are great at their job, but we highly recommend Dr. Sapna to any would-be mothers who are looking for a \u201cFriend\u201d in their \u201cDoctors\u201d.

I will explain our experience in the following lines for the benefit of expecting parents. \nMy wife started experiencing preterm labour at 30 weeks. My wife was admitted for 2 days and the Doctor was successful in stopping the preterm delivery. My wife was under medication (including complete bed rest) advised by Dr Sapna Lulla. Later at 36 weeks 5 days my wife delivered a healthy baby boy at Motherhood Hospital HRBR layout. On top of all, the delivery was a normal one  even though our previous child is born through C-Section delivery.  Doctor reached the hospital in very short notice even at 3:15 am. I could see from the window of hospital waiting area that Doctor was rushing out of her car and running to the delivery room. We appreciate the \"patient first\" approach of the doctor. \nWe appreciate the duty doctors/supporting/nursing staff of the hospital for their support and friendly care. \nFinally we thank Dr Sapna Lulla for  helping us to have a healthy baby!!!",

It was 3 months to go before my delivery and I was very apprehensive in changing my doctor at such an advanced stage of the pregnancy. \r\n\r\nI still remember my first visit to Dr Sapna coz I was talking about it with my husband for a long time. She patiently went through the notes of my previous doctor to understand the issues I had faced and the care I had been provided. She called my earlier doctor to discuss my case and in a way seek permission to take my case forward. She did a thorough check up on me to understand my current situation.\r\n\r\nEver since that day, right through the remainder of the pregnancy, during and post the delivery Dr Sapna has been there right through, the care she displayed was very comforting for me. I delivered 4 weeks before my due date and had to call her in emergency. She was at the hospital within a very short period of time to initiate the C-section.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Dr Sapna, the staff at Ovum Hospital were very caring and good. A much better experience than what I had at the hospital where I went for my first babys delivery. \r\n\r\nDr Sapna is a very caring and professional doctor.  I have recommended her to quite a few of my friends who are expecting and would continue to do so in future as well.\r\n\r\nThank You Doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

She made it happen so easily and simply that  fter meeting her I never realised dat I even had ny problem before. Something  for which we were praying since long nd became nervous so many tyms during the journey, had became possible so easily as if she had done some magicDuring the entire nine months , she was so proactive to understand any complication which can arise during the pregnancy and always took necessary steps to avoid it in advance and dis made everything so smooth..she is so determined to deliver normally and prepares her cases too for it. In labor room during pain when I saw her I knew that now everything will be fine. My baby boy is 5 months old now and finally I m able to write feedback for her which I always wanted to but was not sure whether my words will be able to explain her.. on my delivery day my husband had heard her talking on phn to sumone that she had kept the dinner for her daughter on the table and she rushed to hospital for emergency delivery. I can never be enough thankful to her for what she gave me but mam and her family will always be in my prayers..I felt so connected to her that even today when I go to cloudnine hospital for my baby's vaccination , just her glimpse makes me so happy..She has raised the standards so high that I don't knw I will be satisfied so much with any other dr. in future or not..I wish I cud consult her only for all my health problems in future,\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude1b. There cannot be a more dedicated nd trustworthy doctor dan her. Also thankful to dr.bhavna who helped sapna mam during my delivery... ",

The Dr Sapna is really a very well experienced doctor and also very cool and calm. The amount of patience and listening to the patient for every (silly) cause is very high & clarifies the same without any hesitation. Hats off to her patience levels. \n\nThe way she look at the patience concerns is really different unlike others. \nShe tries to treat her patience with minimum medication and maximum care. She never let go her smiley what ever is the situation and time. That's the beauty of the doctor.\n\nShe will ask to go thought most of the standard tests to know the health of the baby and mother at every step. Her cool interaction makes every patient relax & Comfortable. When the months passes and closing to the 34th week, she gave her number to reach her any time (24 hrs) without any hesitation which gives you so much confidence. \n\nAll you need to do is follow her instruction in a timely manner. That's it. At 38th week we met doctor as a routine check up. She found out water breakage and she took a decision & asked to admit in hospital. That day She was in the hospital till 12:30 AM in midnight and monitored and again called up duty Doctor and checked the same at 4 AM early in the morning. Nothing improved so she decided to take C Cut and finally we got a health boy. She discharged in just 2 days of time.  Both baby and mother doing well. Once again Thanks to Dr Sapna. \n\nI recommend her strongly if anybody wants a good and positive treatment. *** ** * ****** ******** energetic, enthusiastic and positive person and a lot of positive energy.  Thank you.",

She asked me to use a tablet n then told me tat she\u2019ll give a diet plan during d next visit. I was not satisfied bcoz of d hurrying behaviour. Frankly I went back bcoz she told me she\u2019ll give me diet plan tats easy to make n blends with my regular food habits. Yesterday I had video consultation n it felt d same way again. She didn\u2019t explain me much abt my problem n didn\u2019t give much instructions. Bcoz of discomfort with her persona even I forgot to ask some important questions. So soon after video call ended I called reception n asked them if I can speak to doctor n I\u2019ve  some doubts. They said they\u2019ll connect in sometime few times n made me wait for hours. I thought ok d doctor is busy n let me talk tomorrow.same thing today n they didn\u2019t even send me prescription yet. I asked them to refund me n it\u2019s fair bcoz I didn\u2019t even get a prescription. They said it\u2019s not possible. Receptionist tried to convince me to talk to dr. I said I\u2019m not comfortable now pls refund. Then she said \u201cI swear on my daughter tat I won\u2019t tell any of this to dr\u201d. * **** ** ***** **** ** ******* ** ** ***** *** **** ***** ****** She said I\u2019m being abusive n stuff n didn\u2019t let me explain n then dr kept calling n she said d same n again didn\u2019t listen. I asked for refund n she denied. Then I said ok let me ask some doubts. She answered them to get rid of me. Then I asked her for diet plan n she said it\u2019s only part of diet counselling. I was shocked. Even yesterday she asked me to send Wat all I ate for 3 days full list. I was asking her y she told me first time n she denied saying tat. Then I asked her y she asked me to send d list n didn\u2019t even let me ask tat. She said I was traumatising her n was asking her staff to record again n again. I started speaking loudly bcoz she\u2019s not letting me ask abt it n then I ended it. I ended up crying. I was made to feel bad, ******* * ************ **** ** ***** ***** ****** * ** *** **** ******* Dr absolutely don\u2019t have any emotional connect n she clearly doesn\u2019t care to explain or show a lil care. **** *** *** ***** *** **** ***** *** **** ** ** ** ****",

She immediately concluded that everything was normal and I could go about resuming my normal activities without suspecting the report. Within the next 5 days, I had entered labour and was asked to rush to Sparsh hospital Infantry road, a good 8 km away while I had earlier preferred a hospital closeby.

She takes more time to listen to her patients, she is thorough, intelligent and welcomes patients questions with thorough answers, her ability to field questions shows how well trained and smart she is. \n Being halfway through this pregnancy already seems so amazing and we feel blessed through this amazing journey because of you and your care.\n\"Giving birth is never easy and hearing from a doctor that your little nugget isn't so little may cause expectant mothers more anxiety\"... Now here the difficult journey started when my baby was detected with Macrosomia and then Dr. Sapna sinked with the situation and helped us to come out of it with her efforts which were out of the box... Apart from being amazed by her professionalism and excellence as a doctor, I am in awe of the way she handled our whole situation, always calm, always speaking to us with all the truth even when it ws scary, always taking my phone calls and text messages, she did not see day or night but connected with us and helped to overcome the macrosomia as she helped in checking my sugars...\nDr. Sapna is a complete personality in herself... I truly believe that your expertise, passion for your job and willingness to be flexible are what brought us to what we are today... Lastly,before saying you are an extraordinary doctor, I want to tell you that you are an extraordinary human being...\nA big Thanx to you.... ",

                "review_text": "Dr.Sapna is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable with every visit. She explains everything and does not hurry up even though she is a busy doctor. I got to know about her through one of my friends. I visited her during my 7th month and since then she has guided me and supported me in all aspects. She told me that I can deliver normally and suggested me to do all the exercises by visiting a physiotherapist. She also suggested to do all house hold cores as it would help me deliver normally. \n\nHowever I ended up in an emergency c section after 10 to 12 hours of labour as my baby's heartbeat started reducing. But the doctor was trying all ways possible till then for a normal delivery and even suggested epidural as I was not able to bear the pain towards the end and I had dilated only about 3 to 4 cm. I though kind of feel that she was not informed about my labour status properly by the hospital staff . But anyways I guess it was God's decision to make me deliver via c section as Dr.Sapna told me that the umbilical cord was very short and a normal delivery would have complicated things even more.\n\nI would like to thank her for all the effort she took. Would highly recommend her \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nPS: She is little busy most of the time as she works hard 24/7 for her patients. So it's better you keep direct contact with her via phone call or message rather than depending on hospital staff to inform her about your status during delivery time or any other emergency situation.",

The doctor came at 7pm which is fine as she had an emergency at the hospital but the staff didn\u2019t even called us to inform the same. We had to wait for another doctor as we had office. The junior doctor saw the urine test as well as the urine culture but did not mention in the prescription about the culture we already did. Basis the normal urine test she prescribed antibiotics which were given through IV and my wife went to the hospital for next 3 days to complete the medication. She did not get any benefit of it, so we went for a follow up consultation to the doctor. She said to do a urine culture as the result of the previous one we did was not mentioned there. We showed the urine culture to her and she said it does not say anything about the resistivity of the bacteria so we will have to do it again. Had she told us about the report during our visit my wife wouldn\u2019t have gone through the IV procedure. When we confronted the doctor about the same she dismissed us very rudely and told to do the test. We did the urine culture from her own lab which she suggested and the result came negative. So we showed it to doctor she just said its normal nothing else",

My previous doctor was not able to diagnose my issue till 7 weeks since I had no symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. On my first appointment (10:15pm, last appointment for her, that day) she took time and heard all my previous health  history and spoke very softly, then immediately she herself scanned as radiologist already left hospital and expressed a doubt of ectopic. She gave her number and asked me to call her for any emergency in the night and get a scan done in the next morning. On the next morning within no time I had to go for laparoscopy as it was confirmed. I was into tears and she gave me great moral support like my family member. From then onwards,I used to regularly consult her for pregnancy as I had PCOS as well. She never put me on induction or medication and asked us to try naturally and I was not confident getting pregnant naturally with one tube and PCOS , but may be because of her positive attitude, the way she treated me and by God's grace I conceived after 8-9 months after surgery. Now I'm 14 weeks pregnant. I really thank Dr Sapna for all her support and I am sure that I am in safe hands.",

I would like to thank the entire team of Ovum for helping us to have our baby safely in our hands since the pregnancy had little complications at the end. At this moment i wish to thank Dr. Sapna Lulla who was our consultant gynec whose guidance and care helped us a lot. We started consulting Dr.Sapna just by seeing some reviews as we were very new to Bangalore. But our experience proved that all the reviews we had read about her are 100% true. She is such a super good doctor and a very down to earth person. She used to explain all the details about the pregnancy in very simple way so that we can understand it easily. She used to listen even our very silly concerns and give suggestions. She never asked us to do any unnecessary scanning during the entire course of our consultation. During the delivery time it was her quick and smart decision helped our little one to come to our hands in normal way without any difficulties. I would like to express my sincere gratitude from the bottom of my heart to Dr.Sapna and her entire team who had taken care of my wife and baby throughout pregnancy and after delivery. May God bless Dr.Sapna and her family.",

In first meet only i felt as if we are her family, with her never ending smile she explained every thing about our family planning and then from day one of my wife's pregnancy she was always there for us every moment. \n\n In today's business minded world we were lucky to get a doctor like her. She will answer every silly questions that every one has specially during first pregnancy. In every monthly/weekly consultation she guided us with her valuable tips. Even being so busy, she always had time for our queries. She proactively guided my wife about do's and dont's for normal delivery. Her first and foremost intention is to go for normal delivery.

After coming to bangalore we did some googling about good gynecologist and decided to consult her. \n\nAt the first visit itself we were very satisfied with her approach. We both have few complications however she motivated and guided us every steps. She would never force you with any decision but will always guide you with a detailed explanation which helps a lot in taking meaningful decisions.\n\nAt 6th month of pregnancy I had gestational diabetes. Everyday night after 2 hrs dinner and early morning I was suggested to check sugar level and informed her over the phone. She picked the phone 11 pm and 6 am. This is just one instance. Whenever I called her she picked up the phone and if she was not available at that time, always ringed back to me. \n\nShe always encouraged us for normal delivery. After 39th week I did not feel any labor pain. We got admitted on 39th week 4 days and she started induced labor in the afternoon on that day. Finally next evening baby delivered normally. \n\nThe Motherhood's hospital sisters were very friendly and took care me and baby every single moment of the stay. \n\nThank you again Dr. Sapna, thanks for the miracle. You are a magician :) ",

She has a lot of experience and can foresee problems much in advance which helps in timely treatment . \nHer commitment level is excellent.  she is available 24/7 not only on call but also at hospital if needed . There were instances when I had to contact her late night and she was available to see me at hospital even at odd hours .\ni was admitted to hospital for a week before delivery due to urinary infection and being at high risk of preterm delivery.I was kept under constant observation and it  was totally worth it . Inspite of delivering at 33 weeks , I delivered healthy babies and it was all\nPossible because of the efforts of Dr sapna . She had made sure that I was taking proper diet and gave enough medications  to make sure that I could deliver healthy babies even if preterm happens .\nShe is a very good person and always welcomes each patient with a smiling face. \n*** **** *** ****** *********** ****** ** **** * ***** *** **** ******** * \nThanks Dr Super Sapna .

Doctor was really friendly and she explains everything in a very brief manner. All the questions in our mind were answered by her, with we even asking.\n\nThere were few complications during 6th month of pregnancy and Dr. Sapna suggested all the possible ways to avoid miscarriage or Pre term delivery. She had taken all the necessary precautions to enhance the baby growth and avoid any complications. I can say that she is very confident and reasonable in her decisions and also she guides the patients in every aspect and boost up the confidence in the patients.\n\nRight from the day we consulted her, she insisted only on normal delivery. She has suggested best exercises and great thing is she even follows  up with patients about the exercises. Even on the day of delivery when my wife startd feeling labor pains, she called in person in the midnight and enquired about the situation.  We were really happy with the personal touch and care.\nI am really excited and happy to say that my wife delivered a baby gal and it was a normal delivery. ",

She guided me with exercises and diet which I used to do. But my earlier scar had become thin and it was a risk to do normal delivery. On Feb 5th I delivered baby boy thanks to her.  \nShe's strict whenever required and also humble when there is concern. She is always good to her patients. Never recommends unnecessary test and the comfort level she gives to her patients is awesome.  I think that's what every pregnant lady looks in her doctor. Her ********* ** **** ***** *** *** confidence and attitude towards her work is awesome. \nI would recommend her to all the women whom I know.\n\n\n",

She organised a lovely team and kept on motivating throughout the delivery process and brought out my child safely into this world. I was not not able to push in the end but she gave her best.\u00a0\u00a0She is an Angel me and my daughter, so is for many other mothers. I would recommend her for anyone anytime.",

It had enveloped my right ovary. \nDr Sapna explained my options and stated that a small operation was required., explained possible repercussions in future. she asked me to get the operation done within a month. I did within 3 weeks. The cyst was a 11.5 x 9.5 cm solid mass(somewhat like a coconut). Within 2 days I was back home and within 1 week back to almost normal.

No unnecessary tests and medications given, available anytime for genuine concerns, timely advices given which are practical to keep good physical and mental health, also, she will make sure she does everything in her capacity for a normal delivery. \nThis journey could not have been so beautiful without doctor Sapna's care. \nHeartfelt thanks.",

Doctor called me when I messaged that I need to speak but was very rude on call and asked me to wats app my doubts, when I wats apped I was again replied back rudely stating doctor doesn't clear doubts in wats app, get to the hospital.Never had this kind of an experience with any doctor so far.

All my complications where personally taken care by her and her team. I was not much informed about my condition since my BP was very high. On the whole I had a very wonderful experience of motherhood with her.",

However took a wise decision to go in for a c section in the night.\nShe never drugged me unnecessarily at all, she asked me to try natural remedies through out my pregnancy. Choosing her all i can say is you are in safe hands. \nThank you Doctor.",

The way she handles the patient I really appriciate her on that. And she is so cooperative and always smiling. I delivered my baby boy on 31.01.2012 it was a normal delivery. Inspite of the baby stuck for morethan half and hour and me being unconsious she handled the situation very calmly inspite of not having any proper equipments and now with the blessings of God and Dr. Sapna maam now my Son is 5.5year old and hw is doing very well. Whenever we were in need of her she had suggested a very Good doctors (not in her branch). Till now if I get very tensed up with anything related to my health i trust only her. And once again thank you so much maam. ALWAYS KEEP SMILING",

She was constantly on the watch for Sugar and Thyroid levels.My wife was hypothyroid before pregnancy and doctor took sufficient care to make sure that the TSH levels were under control. After completion of 38 weeks, my wife started having rock like abdomen hardness with no pain. Dr Sapna from her experience, suggested that this could be because of the dose of thyroid medication my wife has been taking. She had the baby's heartbeat monitored for a 20 min period after which she recommended a C-Section as the baby seems to have breathing issues. We agreed to the C-Section and it turned out that her decision was very timely as the baby was cramping for room and the placenta had started wearing off. \n\nThanks to Dr Sapna for her timely decision making and care. We owe you a lot !\n\nThanks,\nAswin",

Dr Sapna is approachable and professional . she helped me conceive within 1.5 months and has been my gynecologist from the day one and taken care of my issues be it severe morning sickness and nausea or low fuild level during the last few weeks of pregnancy. She tried her best to push me into having normal delivery unfortunately due baby's deteriorating condition had to check in for C-section. I've been her patient for more than a year now and I'm truly appreciate her efforts in supporting me during my pregnancy and childbirth. She's a genuine doctor who does not prescribe unwanted medicine and always pushes mother and baby towards health and wellness.",

She has treated me so well that when ever I went for my check ups I used to feel that I am going to meet my friend. I got the correct treatment for whatever problems I faced during my pregnancy. She used pick up my calls immediately no matter what ever time it was. I used to call her even at midnight. She used to respond so sweetly. She has a sweet smile always on her face n she talks to the patients so nicely. My operation was very complicated because of my previous c - section which wasn't done properly. She was calm and she did the operation without having any tensions in her face. She was consoling me during the operation so that I don't get worried. I love her very much and I would suggest her to the whole of my family and also friends. Thank so much Dr.Sapna for all the help you have done and for the wonderful operation. It's one and a half months now and I am doing all my work on my own.",

In terms of our experience from past one year, she provided confidence, knowledge, conversation, and extensive surgical experience that truly lacked in our experiences with other Ob/Gyneac. Her patient handling was tailored to accommodate our hesitations and uncertainties unlike the other physicians we had seen with in the same field. She is exceptionally intelligent, and while not effusive, she's candid and confident in her recommendations. After surgery and all our visits with Dr. Sapna, our only regret was we hadn't encountered her sooner. Not all cases will be textbook in medicine, but the journey will be positive when you're confident you have quality and experience on your side. We would recommend Dr. Sapna to anyone.\r\n\r\nDr. Nagamani Arun",

From the initial conversations , patients feel like now they are in safe hands under very professional and experienced guidance. She makes us feel like we are her family members. I was working in Europe , however I didn\u2019t feel the connection or bond with my gynaecologist there, I wasnt confident enough. So I decided to come to home country for delivery.  I visited Sapna ma\u2019am with complaints of severe diarrhoea and slow growth of fetus. She immediately acted, instructed for various maternal USG, identified the possible concerns and causes and admitted me. She administered IV drips with amino acids etc which really helped my situation. I am in awe of her. The entire staff at Aster CMI is super friendly and warm. I Highly recommend Sapna ma\u2019am to all expecting mothers with high risk pregnancy concerns and wish her all the best, She is God sent. ",

Positive point in consulting her is always that she will not prescribe you unnecessary medication or test. She will try her best to treat you naturally. I have trusted her past 6 years and I am happy to recommend her as a gyanc. for health issues. Just you need to trust her, follow her treatment and you will see the results.",

We would miss the signature word \u201ckarke\u201d for most of the sentence she uses :) we\u2019re really thankful to her for taking good care of us and we will always have the gratitude towards her\n.

After 2-3 yrs of struggle (visiting various doctors, getting too many injections, eating a bag full of medicines, mentally stressed, and physically unfit), I consulted Dr Sapna and got pregnant in 2-4months of her treatment. Her experience, persistent treatment, motivation, attention to my small small concerns, and she even took the extra effort to explain things and most importantly involved my husband in every decision. She even takes care of your mental health plus your pocket. She helped in getting normal delivery rather a C-section. Which is nowadays a blessing to have it as most of the doctor recommends c-section as a new normal. I will highly recommend Dr Sapna for any gynec issue. Thank you, Doctor, for everything.\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude42",

Which i felt was very rare to these days.\n\nShe has the ability to convey the message across in an effective way, without scaring the patients. Very positive and  willing to take a calculated risk for the patients. \n\nThank you Dr for your dedication for the patients. Really appreciate your attention to the details through your busy schedule. God bless you.\n\n-Preetham R and Meleena \n",

The staff / team were very kind and helpful, clean and hygienic place and best care taken. I got discharged after 4 days from the hospital, soon after I felt better. Recovering now and with absolutely no complaints.\n\nDr Sapna Lulla is a very experienced doctor, She knows the best and she has given us some great advise. She gives great confidence and comfort whilst you discuss your concerns with her. She has a lot of patience and never hurry things up. \n\nMyself and my family members are very happy and we pray great success for her ...blessed to have her in my life.\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f ",

The delivery of my son went smoothly even with this ongoing COVID19 situation and lockdown.\n\nThe only words that comes to our mind to describe Dr.Sapna Lulla's exceptional care, would be her genuine kindness, trustworthy, passionate, and most importantly, our guardian angel.\n\nAll in all a very good journey worth remembering with you mam at cloud nine HRBR Bangalore.. \n\nA Big Thank You from Ayon Bhadra & Monalisa Roy.",

Always got her response for our messages on sugar level readings and guidance at any time, day or night.\nShe was always available for us because of which we were so confident.\n\nHad a baby boy normal delivery.

I had an early pregnancy complications but for Dr. Sapna care and treatment we couldn't have continued our joyful journey. Just listen to her advice, follow the same you will definitely reap the benefits. I have visited other gynaecologist too but I felt she was experienced in her field and and she always prefers/ suggests natural diet. I definitely suggest her for anyone who is expecting a new born and I personally have seen her doing complicated delivery.",

She was very friendly with my wife and if my wife have any problem, doctor handles it very efficiently and in a very friendly way.\nAt the time of labour pain also, she was very supportive and she tried and made the delivery normal. For a moment It looks like my wife has to go for C section, but doctor waited for the normal delivery and she made it. Thanks to Sapna Lulla for treating my wife in a really well manner.\nI would suggest everyone just go for the doctor , *** ** *** ***** Once Again thanks to Sapna Lulla.",

After meeting Dr. Sapna, we understood that it is not the hospital that matters but a reliable and trust-worthy doctor who you would need for your pregnancy. Dr. Sapna was the only one we can recommend for this as she can convert a complex pregnancy (like ours, fibroid risk) to a normal delivery with ease. \nWe trusted the doctor blindly as this is our first pregnancy and she has delivered more than our expectation. Would strongly recommend this doctor for any one who is looking out for the best doctor for your pregnancy. Her positive attitude would inspire you for a safe pregnancy.\nThank you Doctor, God bless you!",

Also for us we had doubt about normal or C-section delivery and Maam was very positive and it was normal delivery. We are very grateful to you for your help and thanks to motherhood hospital for all the support.  I would like to suggest others to consult with Dr. Sapna Maam for pregnancy related.

Similarly, she knows her staff and their strengths well. All this ensures that her advices are based on the complete picture. \nCertainly recommended.",

Especially im unaware what happens in pregnancy.\nAlso I had to wait a lot to meet the doctor, even though i had prior appointment.\nSince its my first pregnancy i expect the doctor to make me understand my problems and solutions instead of ignoring.",

Usually hospital and Sr. Doctor little hesitate to attend CGHS patient, but Dr Sapna  being Sr Doctor, never let us feel that. For her we are a patient like all others.\nOn 36th weeks we had a littile complication regarding Amniotic Fluid index, it was going down side, which results less growth of baby in womb.  She admited my wife and tried to improve level, but it was further going down, ultimately decided to go for Caesarean Section. For our first baby (Caesarean Section only), cut was done vertically, causes problem during this time. Thanks to her, she did it nicely, and it's 7 days to our baby. Both baby n my wife are fine n healthy.\n\nDuring our admission Dr was on line with duty doctor at night 1:30 and morning 4:30 too, it shows how much she is involved with her patient.\n\nDuring OPD visit, we may wait for 15-30min mostly or some time more (if more receptionist will inform over the phone in morning itself). This wait is not because she is late, actually in between she will go to OT and runningly come back. \n\nHats off to her* * **** **** *** ** *** ***** ",

We are grateful to Dr Sapna for all the help, guidance and care she provided to us during the course of pregnancy. She managed to push the delivery date by two weeks more than the usual thereby helping babies gain weight. Our babies were delivered safely and are doing fine.Would like to reiterate what many others have said earlier - Dr Sapna Ma\u2019am is gem of a doctor, a through professional with a assuring smile and genuine care for patients.Would like to highlight two things that, we believe, deserve special mention. First, high standards that she has set for her entire team, not only at Sapna Health Care but also at extended hospitals. Second, despite her busy schedule, she is available at any time. In case of emergency, she told us to call her immediately irrespective of the hour and also gave us the back-up mobile numbers. At one point when we were going through a critical phase, she called us late in the evening around 11:30 pm and again next morning around 8:00 am to check the things. This was very reassuring.If you are consulting with Sapna Ma\u2019am, we can say with sincerity and utmost confidence that you are in safe hands.",

The best thing about her is that she always has    suggested me to opt for natural sources of nutrition(fruits,veggies etc) rather than relying on supplements.In addition,she has always motivated me towards normal delivery and being physically active throughout pregnancy especially in 3rd trimester.By God's grace and routine followups,i was doing well without any single health issue ( i was regular to my office as well till 8th month\ud83e\udd17) and was quite excited for normal delivery.umfortunately,normal delivery couldnt happen coz of last minute complication and i delivered baby boy via cesarean mode.I was quite depressed post surgery for which she gave sufficient time to make me feel better and move out if it (blaming to destiny)Well,i still visit her for post surgery concerns I appreciate dr sapna for her support and guidance during all my visits.once again,a big thanks to Dr. Sapna!!!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a-Regards,Preeti Avasthi",

She gave us the confidence and made us feel positive. \nHer positive attitude helped me get a smooth flow of things through out my pregnancy. \n\nEven with issues like bleeding,diabetes, thyroid she gave me the confidence of having a normal delivery . I just followed her advise and with the leadership of Dr\u00a0 Sapna and the\u00a0 team of motherhood sister's I delivered a baby boy . And the best thing was it was a normal delivery. \n\nDay\u00a0 2 I was discharged with good health and the credit goes to Dr\u00a0 Sapna.\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH DR SAPNA.\u00a0 ",

We went to Ovum at the time of 7th month and consulted Dr. Sapna Lulla for the first time. She treated and explained all the things very well. She gave her personnel number and told us to call even midnight also if there is any emergency. In 8th ending(last Sunday) my wife developed an emergency situation. Delivery pains started for her. I could not understand what to do, because we met Dr. Sapna only once and the Hospital where we used to consult is too far. Finally I called Dr Spana and told her the situation. She remembered my wife name and asked to come to Ovum hospital directly. By the time we reached hospital she came to hospital(Even though it is Sunday) and she made arrangements for emergency care. She did cesarean surgery. Post surgery NICU care also is excellent at Ovum. Now both babies are doing fine in NICU. She responded on time(Even though it was Sunday) and took care of my wife and babies. Otherwise situation would have entirely been different and can't imagine. that. How can we express our gratitude to Dr, Spana except saying big Thanks to her.",

I called her and she asked me to message her incase of anything. But she seemed very impolite even while responding on whatsapp.I was okay to even book appointment and she blocked me on whatsapp. Please tell me which doctor would do that? She has her own clinic or hospital now, I understand doctors are all busy and overworked during Covid but please don't respond if you are not free or in a good mood. But don't respond and block a person who is seeking help from you. If practo wants to check the facts, I have the screenshot where she has blocked my number. Though she was very strict or whatever, I wanted her to be my gynaec for my second baby too because of my own sentiments. But this is not how you treat a person who is anxious to get some clarification from you.  Please please please don't do that to a pregnant woman or woman who are trying to conceive. Motherhood should be an empowering experience and should not be made to feel small by the doctors. It's not how it should be. ",

There were multiple complications we faced from 4th to 6th month and Dr advice has helped gain our baby girl\u2019s weight through this time. We anticipated a premature birth and it happened so by 6.5 weeks early. We as parents to be were obviously worried and Dr did the best to push through to 34th week from 30th even with complications. Our baby is a week old now and yes, she need more care through the first 5-8 weeks, but she is safe.\n\nDr was available at almost all times when we reached out to her, unless she had any prior appointments. One thing I/we learnt through the pregnancy is, every small thing matter to us and we try to get double checked if all is well with doctor. That\u2019s quite normal and human tendency. At the same time, if Dr is unavailable, we should also understand, there is someone else she is attending to, who need urgent attention.\n\nShe tried to push for a normal delivery all through, but, she transparently conveyed when it could possibly endanger the delivery process and we had to chose otherwise.\n\nThank you again Doctor and wish you all the very best in bringing a whole next generation of babies every single day!",

Then I approached Dr. Sapna after doing research. Dr. Sapna is a fantastic doctor. *** **** ********** ******** *** ***** ***** *** ********** I was too much afraid initially but Dr. Sapna took care of me as a mother and under her guidance and support we got our bundle of joy. She is very friendly and always accessaible whenever needed. I delivered baby boy two and half month ago under her treatment via normal delivery. During my whole journey with her she was so attentive and guided me on every step on what is good for me and baby. She was very much focused for doing normal delivery. She handled my case with the utmost care with her expertise. The way she directed me during the time of delivery was top of the world. She filled so much confidence in me and I always felt safe in her hands during my whole journey.\nI would say that whoever is planning for baby should consult Dr. Sapna atleast once then they would themselves realise that Dr. Sapna is the best.\nThank you so much mam. It was an amazing experience with you. *** *** *** *** *** you gave us our life as our baby.\n",

During the delivery phase she was provided required comfort and confidence. Even we have some bad opinion on cloud nine(Money Minded) we have shifted from motherhood to cloud nine only because of Dr. Sapna Lulla. \n\nI offer my heartfelt thanks for the treatment and care I received under Dr Sapna Lulla's careful supervision. I would strongly recommend her and would consult her during my next pregnancy as well.\n\n\n\n",

My wife had a fever around week 10, she handled it well by comforting my panicked wife first, administering periodic paracetamol drips and monitoring, keeping the night duty doctor completely informed about the case so he could handle in case we come back to the hospital for an emergency. Her control over the situation and transparency in communicating the plan gave us a lot of confidence. We had to plan the delivery in a different city for personal reasons.

She always made me comfortable no matter what were my problems/questions. She gave me required medication with required diet and exercise. She always encouraged me to have normal delivery. \n\nAs I am from Pune,  I was planning to do delivery in Pune. With Doctor's help and support, I always wanted to do delivery under her observation. For my travel, she suggested to travel after 36 weeks as I could not travel before 28 weeks due to my job.  \n\nWhen I came for final checkup before my date,  she told us that baby might come out very soon which was very shocking for us as we were not prepared for it. But doctor assured us that things will be OK and we will be able to travel  if there are no other problems. But she was sure that baby will come soon before my travel. \n\nOn same day,  I started having cramps. When I called doctor,  she asked us to come immediately to the hospital. She made sure that everything is ready when I reach there.  When I reached,  she literally ran to labour room to handle my case.  There was no lady relative with me,  she stood with me like a mother and handled my delivery very well. By God\u2019s grace, I had normal delivery.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Sapna for her support and care. I recommend her for anybody who is looking for a good obstetrician.",

From the first visit, our consultation was satisfactory and we gained confidence in each visit thereafter. The good thing which I personally noticed is her way of approach, explanation given to the couples and the care she places in front of you about your health. Whether it may be a normal or a complicated issue some doctors lack in the way it has to be explained but she is worth it! Even when she moved to a different hospital we didn't change our track. She tried her best to postpone the delivery date till 39th to 40th week, but unfortunately had to go for C-section sighting the complication of early pregnancy. From the time we consulted her till the delivery and even after that, she had given us the confidence of being in safe hands. We are finally blessed with a baby girl under the supervision of Dr. Sapna and her team by C-section. Cutting it short, I would give thumbs up to this lady and I would recommend everyone.\n\nLast but not the least, Thank you so much Doctor for all your support and guidance.",

And with doctors help, and by God\u2019s grace the date was pushed from 32 weeks to 38 weeks through fluid injection and regular monitoring of the fluid level and growth of baby. It was a C-Section, but we\u2019re glad that both are safe and baby was born with good health. Thank you once again Dr. Sapna\ud83d\ude42",

Doctor sapna is an amazing doctor, very friendly, she treats her patients with lots of patience which makes us more comfortable to discuss our problems and concerns with her. She was always available when ever I needed her. Unlike other doctors who would come at the end of labor when everything is ready, doctor sapna was present all the time with me. I went to LR at 11pm and doctor being by your side at that time gives you more comfort and confidence. I delivered around 3.30am and the doctor was present with me all the time. Not even for a second was I left alone. The labor was also a pleasant event, thanks to the doctor and her team. I would recommend doctor Sapna to all the ladies concerned about their pregnancy. ",

The doctor always tried to maintain the sugar levels through diet and medication was kept to a minimum. The delivery was also handled very well ,as the baby did not come to position and the water had broken.  We are grateful that we have doctors like  her who still focus on healthy ways of lifestyle than resort to the eaay way of medication. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

She ensured that I could enjoy my pregnancy and delivery in a positive, relaxed manner while ensuring the good health of me and my baby. Delayed cord clamping, immediate skin-to-skin contact for mother and baby, bare minimum medicines and supplements, pushing for natural healthy food intake and exercises all are reasons why I would recommend her to all pregnant women. Another plus is she takes the time to listen to you and explains everything clearly without inducing fear in any way. Thanks to her, I had a very happy healthy  pregnancy and had a healthy baby, and a healthy post natal life as well. ",

I also need to mention her team (Dr Swetha and others), they are simply superb.\n             Being a first time mom i surely had some nervousness but she definitely helped me sail through my journey of pregnancy smoothly. I'm thankful to have her as my doctor.",

The course of the period before delivery was smooth for me and without any hiccups. \nAt the time of delivery, her aim was always to deliver the child in a normal way. I was admitted at night to the hospital (motherhood hrbr) and she tracked my hourly progress through the phone. When it was time for delivery she reached on time and helped in delivery within an hour, thanks also to the support staff at motherhood. \nOverall it was a very nice experience for me and recommend Sapna to anyone looking for a good obstretician.",

Baby had passed the motion in the mother womb itself.\n\nAlthough MAS is often not life-threatening, it can cause significant health complications for your newborn. And, if MAS is severe or untreated, it can be fatal.\nIn spite of these complications, our baby was born through Normal delivery and she is doing fine.\nMany many thanks to Dr. Sapna Lulla. She explained me everything just before the delivery and then after taking my consent she went for Normal delivery. It was very smooth and baby is also fine and healthy.\n\nThanks to Nursing staffs also. They were very caring and helping throughout our stay.\n\nI recommend Dr Sapna Lulla to everyone.\n\n",

I have a known condition of PCOD for over 10 years, I have been to other doctors and done multiple tests and taken a lot of medications along the way. When I first met Dr. Sapna, she first made me do tests and put me on a set of medications. After a review after a few months, she realised that, that particular line of medication was just not working for me. \r\nAlso, we have been trying to get pregnant for the past one year, so started doubting if there are possible fertility issues. We voiced these concerns to Dr. Spana and after she decided to do a test to evaluate my hormones. Once the test was done, she suggested a laparoscopic ovarian drilling...she informed us that this line of treatment is required for me to get better and is going to help in the long term. \r\nThe procedure was done by Dr. Sapna and Dr. Srisailesh, they found that I had a polyp and a block in my fallopian tube which they removed. The procedure was an absolute success and the attention provided by both the doctors were excellent. \r\nI have absolute faith in Dr. Sapna that she's going to help me in my journey to overcome PCOS and help us get pregnant. \r\nI would recommend Dr. Sapna to anyone looking for a doctor who is not only gync but also has in-dept knowledge with fertility issues as well.

I went to her specifically to have a normal delivery and despite the cord being around my baby's neck she made it happen. She's an expert at complicated delivery. She's very thoughtful and ensures that her patients are not spending a lot on unnecessary visits or medicines. I went to her just 2 weeks before my delivery as I had an issue with the gynecologist I was seeing at Ovum. And she made me feel like I was consulting her all through. We need to have more doctors like her and we'll end up developing trust in doctors. She displayed awesome team management skills in the labor room \nHer team was well equipped, courteous and emphatic. We went to motherhood just for her and it was totally worth it. Thank you motherhood for hiring her, her patients will come back to your hospital just for her.",

She did her best till the very last and made sure to always keep us well informed of what was happening and making us feel comfortable every time we meet her and spoke to her. She is a very good doctor knows exactly what has to be done. Even with the amount of patients she meets daily she has time for all her patients and is very friendly. Motherhood HRBR layout is luck to have Dr Sapna as their Doctor. \n\nThank You from \nChantalle, Joel and Baby Luke. ",

At my first consultation itself, she instilled a lot of confidence and gave me an assurance that I was in safe hands.

I am very thankful to Dr.Sapna for a smooth and seamless pregnancy and delivery experience. ",
