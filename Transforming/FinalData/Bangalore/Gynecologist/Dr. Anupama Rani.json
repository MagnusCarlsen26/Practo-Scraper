She suggested me all the possible options for normal delivery and did not force her decision on to us. On 23rd April I have delivered my baby girl(vaginal).During the labour, she made sure that to explain every next step she is doing. She was kind enough to bring the positivity during the entire procedure.The staff and nurses at the hospital are very good and caring. I am lucky to get the reference of Dr. Anupama from my friend. I am surely going to recommend Dr. Anupama and cloudnine to my friends and family members.",

She has been supportive throughout the journey.\n\nI had some complications with my first pregnancy. I have seen where doctors force their opinions and try to change minds. Instead, Anupama gave me the pros and cons of both options and helped me decide. She has immense patience and explains everything clearly. She encourages asking questions and resolving any doubts we have.\n\nI feel a sense of calm after talking with the doctor. Any difficult decision you might have to make, the doctor will help you without any bias.***** **** *** ********* *********** ***** ** ********** She is so caring that she will ask you not to travel far to show the reports but rather share them on WhatsApp or Email.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, I followed the doctor's advice for diet and exercise. They proved to be very useful, as I had a normal and smooth delivery. She explained each stage of pregnancy in detail, what to expect, and what to watch out for. She keeps you informed about everything. I had a beautiful pregnancy experience, delivery, and postpartum recovery because of her.\n\nMany of my friends and family were worried if my delivery would be smooth. However, I never had that worry since I had put my full faith in the doctor.

So we met Dr Anuapama again, and she guided us with specific tests to find out if there were any issues. With her help, we eventually got pregnant and delivered a baby boy. My wife\u00a0had hypothyroidism with diabetes, which means the pregnancy was a high-risk one. Dr Anupama have been there to support and help at every stage, giving clear details on every report and tests done. She also provided us with her number to contact in case of any doubts during our pregnancy journey. We are truly\u00a0blessed to have such a gynecologist in our life. We highly recommend her.",

Throughout the pregnancy,she was available on watsapp in case of any doubt.she listens carefully and was never in hurry. She suggested me all the possible options for normal delivery and did not force her decision on to us. On 23rd April I have delivered my baby girl(vaginal).During the labour, she made sure that to explain every next step she is doing. She was kind enough to bring the positivity during the entire procedure.The staff and nurses at the hospital are very good and caring. I am lucky to get the reference of Dr. Anupama from my friend. I am surely going to recommend Dr. Anupama and cloudnine to my friends and family members.",

She has been supportive throughout the journey.\n\nI had some complications with my first pregnancy. I have seen where doctors force their opinions and try to change minds. Instead, Anupama gave me the pros and cons of both options and helped me decide. She has immense patience and explains everything clearly. She encourages asking questions and resolving any doubts we have.\n\nI feel a sense of calm after talking with the doctor. Any difficult decision you might have to make, the doctor will help you without any bias.***** **** *** ********* *********** ***** ** ********** She is so caring that she will ask you not to travel far to show the reports but rather share them on WhatsApp or Email.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, I followed the doctor's advice for diet and exercise. They proved to be very useful, as I had a normal and smooth delivery. She explained each stage of pregnancy in detail, what to expect, and what to watch out for. She keeps you informed about everything. I had a beautiful pregnancy experience, delivery, and postpartum recovery because of her.\n\nMany of my friends and family were worried if my delivery would be smooth. However, I never had that worry since I had put my full faith in the doctor. As expected, my delivery went super smoothly, all credit to the doctor.\n\nI consider myself extremely lucky to have found her, and I highly highly recommend the doctor.",

During this time Dr. Anupama guided us and did the DnC properly. We were trying to get pregnant again, but it was taking longer than usual. So we met Dr Anuapama again, and she guided us with specific tests to find out if there were any issues. With her help, we eventually got pregnant and delivered a baby boy. My wife\u00a0had hypothyroidism with diabetes, which means the pregnancy was a high-risk one. Dr Anupama have been there to support and help at every stage, giving clear details on every report and tests done. She also provided us with her number to contact in case of any doubts during our pregnancy journey. We are truly\u00a0blessed to have such a gynecologist in our life. We highly recommend her.",

During every consultation she used to patiently address all our queries and proactively provided guidance on all possible scenarios as we progressed through our pregnancy. Her diagnosis is very apt and recommends minimal medication and lab tests unless absolutely necessary. She also recommended us to go for Physio session as the baby position was in breech which helped me to change baby position and remain active throughout my pregnancy. Her guidance helped us during the labour process for a normal delivery. Me and my husband are grateful to have chosen her for our pregnancy journey! ",

I am not exaggerating when I say she is so knowledgaeble, kind, compassionate, patient all at the same time! She takes the time to address all concerns and questions, no matter how big or small they may seem. No rushed consultations. Every consultation, my husband and I walked out with so much clarity & content. Being an unplanned pregnancy and having conceived amidst multiple treks & off-roading, we had a lot of questions starting from day 1, and she did not shy away from debunking all myths and explaining things backed with reasons. She even draws on a paper to help us picturise and understand how it all works. And if at all we missed to ask something during consultation, she was available on whatsapp throughout. Cannot stress on the importance of having someone like that, esp during the pregnancy journey when every other day you have so many questions that you need some sensible answers and inputs (with so much unwanted information coming from all directions). My 9 months of pregnancy journey was a breeze. She helped me to maintain a healthy pregnancy journey. I even made 3-4 trips during my second trimester after discussing on do's and don'ts with her. \n\nI had a normal vaginal delivery a month back, and trust me when I say she was like a solid pillar & strength helping me through the whole labour. I got admitted at 11am and got out with my little bundle of joy at 4pm. First thing I did the next day when she came to check on me was to give her a tight hug. Wouldn't have been possible without her.\n\nShe is such a blessing. If you are expecting a baby and looking for a no-nonsense OB-GYN, go meet Dr. Anupama Rani. Will be your best decision, as was mine.",

In hindsight that turned out to be a wonderful stroke of luck to have found a gem like Dr Anupama. The routine tests were conducted and any minor issues seen corrected with use of supplements and diet.\nShe heard us patiently and suggested best course of action always.\nWe already did a Lamaze course and were well aware of best practices for gentle birth and told the Dr about her preference weeks before birth to which she assured and also added few practices that may differ due to situation around labour time. We told doctor about our preference on normal vaginal delivery and the preference was well supported by her.\nShe was reachable through whatsapp and even through phone during the labour time at night.\nUnfortunately due to long labour and inability to progress we needed to opt for a C section, but she supported us throughout, she even offered labour induction to respect our decision for a normal delivery which we thought would prolong the pain and hence chose to undergo C section. Our precious daughter was delivered through c section and my postpartum recovery was great, the stitches were done nicely and healed . Thank  you doctor, I highly recommend her",

From day 1 we were very satisfied with the way she explains the issue and the treatment she suggests. I was very confident through out my pregnancy journey and in the operation theatre only because I know Mam is there. No unnecessary medications, no unnecessary scans or any no unnecessary tests. On every consultation She was always listening to our queries and will explain what the patient should know very clearly. One more very important factor that we were very much impressed by her is she shared her WhatsApp number with us on the first consultation and always used to reply to our queries almost immediately ( even if it is a minor doubt). She tried to do normal delivery as I didn\u2019t have any complications as such. But unfortunately we had to go for c section. But the operation and recovery was very smooth. We and our baby are always grateful to Mam and one such important person in our lives. I strongly recommend doctor Anupama Mam. ",

Thank you Practo for this !! \nAt first we were anxious about this whole pregnancy journey being the first time parents. But after having our first consultation with mam we felt that she is the right one for our pregnancy journey. In the end it was her who delivered our BABY GIRL !!  It was a memorable experience for us !! She is very friendly, listens to our concerns first and then gives us best possible advice. Also kept us informed about the whole process at every stage. Out of all, she was just one text away in WhatsApp when we needed her the most that helped us a lot. \nDelivery experience:  Unfortunately I'm not able to go through NVD due to complications at the time of labor. Also, I was not mentally prepared for C-section but her words and comfort in the labor room gave me confident to go through the whole process confidently. No matter how much we plan during the pregnancy for the D day, unplanned scenarios do happen and in our case luckily we had the right person beside us. \n\nIn the end journey matters !! \n\nThank you mam \u263a\ufe0f",

We are blessed with a baby girl now and I can't thank my doctor enough for the support she's giving even now for my postpartum challenges.I would strongly recommend my doctor for any gynaec related issues and she will treat the patients with less medications.

During first trimester we had little issues related to blood flow to child due to slight bleeding. And we were fully stressed out. That is when with the recommendation of known people and with the help of other patient\u2019s review we switched to Dr Anupama. I must say that was the day our mindset fully changed and we gained lot of positivity. Dr Anupama Madam was so kind to answer all our queries and doubts patiently  and best part is she was just a call away. Sometimes at odd hours if we had any doubt she used to reply in few mins which gave us confidence and moral support. My wife had water break at 38th week and general trend is doctors tend to do c-Sec to avoid further infection. But in our case we were lucky that Dr Anupama ma\u2019am had used her vast experience and took decisions on time and tried inducing pain and pushed us towards normal delivery keeping all the scenario in mind. I must say it was Dr Anupama madam efforts and timely guidance during pregnancy that we had normal delivery. More than anything else if you connect to your doctor well than half of the problems go away. Dr Anupama gave us the moral support and that connection which we were requiring most during our period which had helped a lot for smooth pregnancy. Madam thank you so much and I mean it.",

I had a normal delivery through episiotomy at the end of 40 weeks and delivered in 3.5 hours of getting admitted to the hospital. She waited till the due date and guided me to go through the early labour at home and come to the hospital only when I reach the active phase of labour. During delivery, when I had a complication, she persistently tried without showing any sign of urgency and kept me updated on what is going on.\n\nThis being my first pregnancy, had lot of doubts and apprehensions about my experiences. She would address them all and explain the rationale all with cheer and patience. Finally, she would also reiterate that it was very common among pregnant women and that everyone goes through experiences which is unique to each pregnancy.\n\nShe shared her contact number and always clarified my concerns with a prompt response. This gave me an additional comfort factor that I can reach out to a reliable person during times when I am bogged down by multiple guidance from people around me.\n\nShe is someone who prescribes only necessary medication and advises the same to be stopped when the symptoms do not surface.\n\nI would highly recommend her. My whole hearted thanks to Dr.Anupama Rani for all her help and support throughout this journey.",

I started visiting her from my 4th month, and my baby was delivered by her in Sakra. Best thing about her is, she never hurry while checkups and scan. She gave sufficient time to resolve our queries and explained many things to me, my husband and mom. I conceived at high body weight and suffered through cold, cough and liver malfunction during pregnancy which made me quite worried and tensed for my baby but she handled everything so well that nothing bad happened during, while and after delivery. She also used to calm my nerves over phone or in-person when needed. She was also persistent for natural delivery till my final moment but since I was unable to bear the labor pain, we had to go for C-section. Throughout my pregnancy period she asked me to follow diet, perform yoga and physiotherapy which helped me huge during and after delivery. My body recovered also quickly. I would highly recommend her for pregnancy consultation and for delivery. I could not think anyone better than her.2. To the Sakra hospital: i would really appreciate Sakra hospital and the nurses who looked after me and my baby so nicely. They are very welcoming and calm as well. The nurses were available even during middle of night. I want to extend my thanks to them as well. The very third day from the operation, I walked to cab and carried my baby.",

The way doctor explained each and every thing at different stages of pregnancy, keeps you well informed. She is extremely patient and will only prescribe the necessary medication.  Doctor also shared her whatsapp number with us and was available over text for any query we had. Even if we wanted to speak to her over call, we would ask a suitable time to call and she would clarify the doubts over call as well. We welcomed our baby boy through c-section and even the post natal consultation was done with extreme clarity. We were really lucky to have found her at an early stage of the pregnancy, which made our journey very peaceful and well informed. We highly recommend the doctor and as a matter of fact have already recommended her to a couple of our friends. ",

And here is the amazing part, she is easily approachable and responds swiftly whenever I reach out to her. Nowadays seldom you come across a doctor like her who is laser-focused on providing best in class treatment to her patients.\n\nThanks a bunch Dr. Anupama for all the guidance and support!",

And of course she will not prescribe any unnecessary medications. Very less medicines and also less consultations unless it is mandatory. Doctor spends so much time for each and she is not a hurry burry kind of Doctor. She listens carefully and understands the problem and gives very good explanation of the problem and solution. After the delivery, recovery was so quick and we are very happy for that. And we are very much thankful to Dr. Anupama Rani. We will definitely recommend Dr. Anupama Rani.

It was great to have Dr.Anupama's support throughout this critical time, as she not only provided medical guidance, she provided emotional support as well. \n\nDuring the first trimester of the pregnancy I had severe nausea and vomiting, and I was physically and emotionally exhausted. Doctor patiently listened to my concerns. And the medications that doctor prescribed helped me with nausea but more importantly her approach boosted my spirits.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, the doctor always patiently listened to our concerns and explained our queries in detail. Dr.Anupama was always one text message away and she always responded to us. We owe a great deal to her for delivering a healthy baby and helping us in many ways through this important phase of our lives. ",

She provides ample time to listen our problems and suggest the routine accordingly. Best thing is she is available 24/7 even for small queries on email/phone - Especially during the covid-19 pandemic times, she suggested only mandatory/limited tests and in-person consultations. Most of the time she use to verify the reports on whatsapp and suggest the medicine. Looking back, i realise that she had done all the right things at the right time and stressed on the importance of walking/pregnancy exercises and made my entire pregnancy journey such a sweet memory. She is best for LSCS - taken utmost care and listens to us during OT procedure. Also she takes good care in checking everything post delivery also. We are really thankful to her for our second bundle of joy.",

I strongly recommend her to my friends, relatives and everyone.\n\n",

At that time I did not know that she is the head of obstretics and gyenecology at Sakra World Hospital. After our second visit she gave the number of Dr. Anupama and suggested to contact and set appointment with her. Our whole journey with Dr. Anupama was very nice. We were glad to get the support of such a good doctor. \nBest thing about her was her calm nature and the way she explained us all about our reports and at one time the amniotic fluid went down, she consoled us and wrote down medicine and told to drink lot of coconut water. To our surprise, it went up by 3 points in a month. \nShe told us the process and some terminologies they use while delivering so that my wife or me does not get scared by listning to the names in labour room. \nThough my wife had to take epidural injection for lessing the pain the way Dr. Anupama motivated her was awesome. She supported throught the journey and at last we had a baby girl through normal delivery.\nAll thanks to Dr. Anupama, nurses and ither doctors of Sakra World Hospital who helped my wife motivated throughout in the Labour room.\nMy baby girl and wife both are now healthy, fit and fine. All thanks to Dr. ANUPAMA for always supporting us.\n",

She understands our needs and also never makes us visit hospitals frequently unless and until mandatory. We are blessed with a baby boy now and I thank my doctor & still she is supporting me even now for my postpartum challenges. I would highly recommend her.

She cleared all our doubts  and questions so patiently and she is always available via phone or whatsapp in case of emergency. Best thing about anupama mam is she always give preference to natural process. She suggested us to trust our body, change life style and food habits which helped a lot. We r lucky to find such a wonderful person as our doctor. I would highly recommend her. A big thank you for all you your support mam. The consultation in foster is very smooth.  Also, the sakra staff helped a lot during my labour. Thanks to all.",
