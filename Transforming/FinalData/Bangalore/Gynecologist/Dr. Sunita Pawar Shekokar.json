                "review_text": "Hi to all the new mommy\u2019s,\nI wanted to share my review regarding my pregnancy period. It was a wonderful journey throughout and most of its credit goes to my doctor (Dr. Sunitha Pawar) and family. \nInitially I was scared about which gynecologist  I should go for during  my pregnancy time as I wanted to have the same doctor throughout. As I am new in Bangalore I was very much confused about the gynecologist  as everyone wants the  best doctor in town to go for during their pregnancy time. The same was the case with me and my husband. We wanted to have a doctor who is more like a family, who can guide and help us like our family member.\nWe searched for many gynecologist on internet nearby our home and found 3-4 very good names. As Motherhood hospital was nearest so we went to this hospital in Sarjapur location and there we got very good reviews about Dr. Sunitha Pawar via many new parents and also her name was also on our list of good doctors in Bangalore so we took her appointment. \nWe are very thankful to Dr. Sunitha as she guided us very well throughout my pregnancy without making me go worried about little things like what I should eat, what if I feel nauseatic or if I need her assistance will she be available. She was available to me all time on her phone and personally whenever I needed her suggestion or advice during this time whether its abot any medicine, weakness or any new changes to my body. She also motivated me and gave emotional support as I was having low lying placenta in the initial phase of my pregnancy which me little worried as this was my first pregnancy. However, Instead of making me worried she always tried to make me calm and make me feel as everything will be alright. \nI have happily delivered a baby girl on this 30th of June 2020 and very happy that Dr. Sunitha was there all the time with me to make me feel comfortable during my operation and eve she also had a talk to my mother so that she will also not be worried during this COVID-19 period as she is staying in my hometown. After talking to the doctor even she also got the faith that everything will be safe and fine with the baby and me.\nI want to share some important point which each pregrency should follow:\n1.\tBelieve on your Doctor.\n2.\tDr. Sunita will answer your queries through whatsapp if you have any doubt.\n3.\t Don\u2019t disturb your doctor unnecessary. Always make lists of thing which you will ask in appointment so that you will not miss anything.\n4.\tShe knows different languages like English, Hindi, and Marathi.\n5.\tYou can also meet Dr. Sunita in HSR Layout\n6.\tTalk to your Dr. Doctor if you noticed any changes in your body.\n7.\tTake proper medicines and monitor your BP, Sugar level, fluid, vitamins.\n8.\tDon\u2019t fit heavy things and try to avoid stairs.\n9.\tDon\u2019t eat non-veg, pineapple and other fruits which make your body warm.\n10.\tMotherhood Hospital is good overall but admin department is not sharing all information like packages, room charges and other thing during C-Section. Kindly checking during admission and emergency. worried",

She is a great listner, puts the patients at ease with her calm demeanor and goes out of the way to ensure that all our doubts are clarified. \n\nRight from the time we started consulting her, she explained all the milestones and guided us all through the way. She gave us a diet chart that she has developed from the knowledge and experience of her 24 years of practice & she insisted on regular exercise and breathing techniques. Unlike a lot of doctors that, she never prescribed any unnecessary medicines or tests. \n\nWhile things were going great for us till the 37th week of pregnancy, my wife developed a medical condition that needed far greater attention and care. This was when Dr.Sunita went beyond the call of duty and dedicated her time and effort much beyond any other doctor would have ever done. \n\nWe were in the hospital for close to a month and she was there with us each day through it, including weekends. It won't be an exaggeration to state that we wouldn't have made through those traumatic times, if not for her sheer dedication, experience and expertise.\n\nShe put my wife's wellbeing before everything else and is the single most important reason both my kid and wife are doing good today.\n\nWe were lucky enough to have found Dr. Sunita and will be eternally grateful to her.

One of the first names to come up was Dr. Sunita's. We booked a consultation with her on week 5 of my pregnancy and did not look at any other doctors after that. Even during the first appointment, Dr Sunita came across as highly capable and warm. Throughout my pregnancy she addressed all our doubts patiently. Whatever advice she gives, her confidence leaves no room for doubt and, as first time parents, I cannot stress how important it is to have a doctor who takes charge and tells you exactly what you should do. \n\nShe's an advocate for normal delivery and encourages it as much as possible. Unfortunately, due to some complications, I had to go in for an emergency c-section. While it was unexpected and scary, Dr Sunita was reassuring and calm throughout the experience. \n\nI have heard from women who have had c sections that their recovery had been extremely difficult and complicated. Fortunately, that has not been my experience. Beyond the first couple of days, post op recovery has been smooth and painless.i have no doubt that Dr Sunita's exceptional skills are the reason for this. \n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful experience with Dr Sunita and would recommend her without hesitation to all women",

It was a wonderful journey throughout and most of its credit goes to my doctor (Dr. Sunitha Pawar) and family. \nInitially I was scared about which gynecologist  I should go for during  my pregnancy time as I wanted to have the same doctor throughout. As I am new in Bangalore I was very much confused about the gynecologist  as everyone wants the  best doctor in town to go for during their pregnancy time. The same was the case with me and my husband. We wanted to have a doctor who is more like a family, who can guide and help us like our family member.\nWe searched for many gynecologist on internet nearby our home and found 3-4 very good names. As Motherhood hospital was nearest so we went to this hospital in Sarjapur location and there we got very good reviews about Dr. Sunitha Pawar via many new parents and also her name was also on our list of good doctors in Bangalore so we took her appointment. \nWe are very thankful to Dr. Sunitha as she guided us very well throughout my pregnancy without making me go worried about little things like what I should eat, what if I feel nauseatic or if I need her assistance will she be available. She was available to me all time on her phone and personally whenever I needed her suggestion or advice during this time whether its abot any medicine, weakness or any new changes to my body. She also motivated me and gave emotional support as I was having low lying placenta in the initial phase of my pregnancy which me little worried as this was my first pregnancy. However, Instead of making me worried she always tried to make me calm and make me feel as everything will be alright. \nI have happily delivered a baby girl on this 30th of June 2020 and very happy that Dr. Sunitha was there all the time with me to make me feel comfortable during my operation and eve she also had a talk to my mother so that she will also not be worried during this COVID-19 period as she is staying in my hometown. After talking to the doctor even she also got the faith that everything will be safe and fine with the baby and me.\nI want to share some important point which each pregrency should follow:\n1.\tBelieve on your Doctor.\n2.\tDr. Sunita will answer your queries through whatsapp if you have any doubt.\n3.\t Don\u2019t disturb your doctor unnecessary. Always make lists of thing which you will ask in appointment so that you will not miss anything.\n4.\tShe knows different languages like English, Hindi, and Marathi.\n5.\tYou can also meet Dr. Sunita in HSR Layout\n6.\tTalk to your Dr. Doctor if you noticed any changes in your body.\n7.\tTake proper medicines and monitor your BP, Sugar level, fluid, vitamins.\n8.\tDon\u2019t fit heavy things and try to avoid stairs.\n9.\tDon\u2019t eat non-veg, pineapple and other fruits which make your body warm.\n10.\tMotherhood Hospital is good overall but admin department is not sharing all information like packages, room charges and other thing during C-Section. Kindly checking during admission and emergency. worried",

She is a great listner, puts the patients at ease with her calm demeanor and goes out of the way to ensure that all our doubts are clarified. \n\nRight from the time we started consulting her, she explained all the milestones and guided us all through the way. She gave us a diet chart that she has developed from the knowledge and experience of her 24 years of practice & she insisted on regular exercise and breathing techniques. Unlike a lot of doctors that, she never prescribed any unnecessary medicines or tests. \n\nWhile things were going great for us till the 37th week of pregnancy, my wife developed a medical condition that needed far greater attention and care. This was when Dr.Sunita went beyond the call of duty and dedicated her time and effort much beyond any other doctor would have ever done. \n\nWe were in the hospital for close to a month and she was there with us each day through it, including weekends. It won't be an exaggeration to state that we wouldn't have made through those traumatic times, if not for her sheer dedication, experience and expertise.\n\nShe put my wife's wellbeing before everything else and is the single most important reason both my kid and wife are doing good today.\n\nWe were lucky enough to have found Dr. Sunita and will be eternally grateful to her.

One of the first names to come up was Dr. Sunita's. We booked a consultation with her on week 5 of my pregnancy and did not look at any other doctors after that. Even during the first appointment, Dr Sunita came across as highly capable and warm. Throughout my pregnancy she addressed all our doubts patiently. Whatever advice she gives, her confidence leaves no room for doubt and, as first time parents, I cannot stress how important it is to have a doctor who takes charge and tells you exactly what you should do. \n\nShe's an advocate for normal delivery and encourages it as much as possible. Unfortunately, due to some complications, I had to go in for an emergency c-section. While it was unexpected and scary, Dr Sunita was reassuring and calm throughout the experience. \n\nI have heard from women who have had c sections that their recovery had been extremely difficult and complicated. Fortunately, that has not been my experience. Beyond the first couple of days, post op recovery has been smooth and painless.i have no doubt that Dr Sunita's exceptional skills are the reason for this. \n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful experience with Dr Sunita and would recommend her without hesitation to all women",

She came to check on me early in the morning and saved me and my baby. I will be ever grateful to her. I would recommend her any day.",

I was quite worried as I had some bad experience in past so I did not wanted anything to go bad . Since my first visit with mam I felt quite happy about the way mam use to explain things . She always helped us to prepare prior for any possible complications.  Her experience made me\n go through all pregnency complications very easily . Actually I never ever thought I could go for normal delivery.  But even though I delivered in 37 week only I did not had any issue , both my kid and I was healthy.\n\nI don't have words to say thanks to mam .\n",

She makes you feel very comfortable and explains the problems and procedures clearly. \nAnd yes I must say it\u2019s all because of Dr. Sunita, I had a smooth painless normal delivery (which was a nightmare for me) and she made it very easy motherhood even in labor room, the way she treated me and build confidence in me was way beyond explanation and all I can say is THANKS A TON DOCTOR. :) :) <3\nshe does responds us over phone as well and she will make sure we are safe\n",
