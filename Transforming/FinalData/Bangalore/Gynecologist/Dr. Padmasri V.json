During pandemic time we had to contact her through whatsapp and she did not guide us to visit her every month. She used to see the report and confirm everything is fine. \n\n3. Like wise I sent my 5th month scan report to her, she confirmed everything is normal, as per advice, when there is emergency we should contact her(Since my pregnancy was going normal, I didn't meet her in 6th month pregnancy). Then I met her with my next scan which is 7th month scan. \nVery badly she yelled at me for the dress I wore *** *** ******* ** **** ***** **** *** ******** ** ***** ** *** ******* She treated me with zero respect. I came out crying.\n\nShe treated me and my husband as illitrate people. She wasn't giving chance to us to talk from our end.
