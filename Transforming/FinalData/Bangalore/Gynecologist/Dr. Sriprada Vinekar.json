We reached out to Dr Sriprada who I would highly recommend for all OBG related issues. She spoke to us with ease and had this ever smilling face. Through the entire pregnancy she explained us, guided us so we could head towards a smooth delivery process. When in doubt, she always asked me to conduct tests,  such as glucose tolerance/ challenge test, urine culture and routine to rule out and possibly catch any issues early. She suggested me to follow a diet chart early on to avoid gestational diabetes.  when we were heading close to term, she promptly monitored the baby weight so we could have a safe and easy normal delivery. On the day of hospitalization, she took special care to ensure I was comfortable at each juncture, when I thought the entire process was overwhelming, she motivated me, gave me a push, encouraged me that I'll be able to deliver baby smoothly. Also, when the baby was born and the placenta did not come off like it should have, she was quick to act and manually removed the placenta to avoid further complications. Dr Sriprada is highly-qualified and experienced. Due to her immense knowledge, she handles even the complex situations with ease. At 28 weeks, the radiologist confirmed that my baby had a congenital anamoly, Dr Sriprada was very kind to comfort/counsel us when we needed it most. She connected us with the best doctors she knew so our baby could the best care once born. There's never been a day when she's not responded to my innumerable questions on Whatsapp! My husband and I are ever grateful and thankful to her for making this experience so worthwhile. ",

She made my pregnancy journey as smooth as possible.

Dr. Sriprada was welcoming and very approachable, while being to the point and very professional.  The appointment with her helped me make quick informed decisions and I was ready for a laproscopy in the the next few days. She is an mazing doctor with a wonderful team. I was briefed about the procedure and told every thing I needed to know and what to expect. This put me to great ease as I knew I was in experienced hands.. Its been a week since my surgery and I'm feeling wonderful!! A huge shout out to Dr. Sriprada for relentlessly working to heal and alleviate pain in so many people. Thank you for your hardwork and empathy!!",

We reached out to Dr Sriprada who I would highly recommend for all OBG related issues. She spoke to us with ease and had this ever smilling face. Through the entire pregnancy she explained us, guided us so we could head towards a smooth delivery process. When in doubt, she always asked me to conduct tests,  such as glucose tolerance/ challenge test, urine culture and routine to rule out and possibly catch any issues early. She suggested me to follow a diet chart early on to avoid gestational diabetes.  when we were heading close to term, she promptly monitored the baby weight so we could have a safe and easy normal delivery. On the day of hospitalization, she took special care to ensure I was comfortable at each juncture, when I thought the entire process was overwhelming, she motivated me, gave me a push, encouraged me that I'll be able to deliver baby smoothly. Also, when the baby was born and the placenta did not come off like it should have, she was quick to act and manually removed the placenta to avoid further complications. Dr Sriprada is highly-qualified and experienced. Due to her immense knowledge, she handles even the complex situations with ease. At 28 weeks, the radiologist confirmed that my baby had a congenital anamoly, Dr Sriprada was very kind to comfort/counsel us when we needed it most. She connected us with the best doctors she knew so our baby could the best care once born. There's never been a day when she's not responded to my innumerable questions on Whatsapp! My husband and I are ever grateful and thankful to her for making this experience so worthwhile. ",

Previous doctors diagnosed PCOS problem and mentioned that it would be difficulty in conceiving. We lost interest and had stopped thinking about having a baby.\r\n\r\n\tAfter 2 years, one of my aunt suggested Dr Sripradha in Cloudnine. I took an appointment and met her. She seemed to be down to earth, friendly, understanding and took time to diagnose and come to a conclusion for any medication further. I was diagnosed Chocolate cyst and did a laparoscopy.  \r\n\r\nShe gave all the positive vibes to us and we as a couple had really found it to be developed hope and were sure this time. I conceived in next 2 months!!!\r\n\r\nDr.Sripradha helped me all 9 months to have a pleased and smooth going pregnancy. She carried her patience all over my pregnancy with all my stupid questions and unnecessary scare of anything unpleasant to happen. \r\n\r\nShe was so committed and helpful during all the ups and downs in my pregnancy when I had complications in my 5th month.\r\n\r\nOn 10th July 2015, I delivered a baby boy \u2013 Healthy, Tall and Heavy weighted that really changed my world.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dr.Sripradha for all the joy I am enjoying in my motherhood\r\n\r\nI have recomended Dr. Sripradha to most of my friends and relatives who have really been happy and found a positive results.",

When we've discussed anything with you, you've explained everything with a warm smile, eliminating our usual fear of doctor visits \ud83d\ude04. Your sharing of personal contact details during our initial visit made us feel supported and cared for throughout. Every consultation left us feeling confident and positive about our journey. Your detailed explanations at every stage of the pregnancy were immensely helpful. Despite your hectic schedule, your lively presence was always reassuring. Thank you for making our pregnancy journey comfortable and creating memories we'll cherish forever.\n\nTanya and Nithin Poovanna",

She made my pregnancy journey as smooth as possible.  Even on the day of my delivery, even though it was in the middle of the night she came to the hospital and made sure she was there until the baby was born and it was a normal delivery. Every stage was explained even in the labour room and I don\u2019t think anyone could have made my delivery feel so easy! Thanks to the doctor, she was really like another mother at the labour room. I highly recommend her to all the preggie mommies! \n",

I was able to get an appointment with Dr. Sriprada within a day and discuss my medical situation in detail and what steps I should be taking next.  Dr. Sriprada was welcoming and very approachable, while being to the point and very professional.  The appointment with her helped me make quick informed decisions and I was ready for a laproscopy in the the next few days. She is an mazing doctor with a wonderful team. I was briefed about the procedure and told every thing I needed to know and what to expect. This put me to great ease as I knew I was in experienced hands.. Its been a week since my surgery and I'm feeling wonderful!! A huge shout out to Dr. Sriprada for relentlessly working to heal and alleviate pain in so many people. Thank you for your hardwork and empathy!!",

She is so friendly with her patients that most of the time patients will not feel that they are sitting with their Doctor. She answer all your queries and does not give any false hopes and does not prescribe any unwanted medicines as well. With her support my wife delivered a healthy baby boy on 14th Feb and it was normal deliver. We are very thankful to Dr. Sriprada for all her support and we wish her best of luck in her life.",

She had fibroids as big as a 10cm (increasing from last 10 years) along with hernia(for the third time).  Mom lost her hope. This is when we consulted Sriprada ma'am and she explained us the problem and the solution very clearly. My mother was approaching her menopause stage however she was bledding badly and complained severe pain . Ma'am guided all of us and helped my mother in getting her  Hysterectomy done. Mom is very happy after her surgery.\nNow me and my husband are planning to have our second baby.I did not conceive yet. Consulted ma'am for the problem. She patiently diagnosed the problem and suggested us a treatment.\nI recommend Sriprada ma'am to everyone.\nThanks.",
