To start the scanning they asked me to go to toilet and come back. By the time I came back from washroom they let another patient inside, again i waited for another 15-20 min. After scanning she told there are two cysts in your ovary. Whatever tablet she prescribed before, she striked off that one and wrote new tablet. Overall 20 mins consultation was done for 3 hours. And by the time consultation was over, ultrasound technician left home so they asked me to come tomorrow to collect the report. I told them my home is far, and requested if the can send soft copy to my email. They told no. Through the consultation doctors interaction is very less *** *** *** ****** *** ****** ***** ***** And chatting with nurse about dry fruits. I asked one question but she didn't even answer properly.

As first-time parents, we were filled with excitement and joy, but also with a mix of nervousness and uncertainty. We wanted to ensure that we were taking the best care of ourselves and our baby, so we sought out the expertise of Dr. Harini P Shetty at The Ovum Hospital in HRBR Layout.\n\nFrom the moment we walked into her, we were greeted with warmth and kindness. Dr. Shetty took the time to sit down with us during the scheduled appointment and explain everything we needed to know about the pregnancy guide and childbirth. She answered all of our questions and alleviated any fears or concerns we had.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, Dr. Shetty was there every step of the way, providing us with all the necessary information and instructions for a healthy and successful delivery. She made sure we were well-informed about each stage of the pregnancy, from the first trimester to the final weeks leading up to the birth.\n\nWhenever we had any doubts or concerns, Dr. Shetty ensured right guidance is provided to the new parents. Her soothing voice and reassuring words helped us navigate through the ups and downs of pregnancy, and we always felt like we were in good hands.\n\nFinally, the day arrived for our baby boy to enter the world. With Dr. Shetty by our side, we felt confident and prepared for the journey ahead. Thanks to her guidance and expertise, we were able to experience a smooth and uncomplicated delivery.\n\nAs we held our precious baby boy in our arms for the first time, we couldn't help but feel immense gratitude towards Dr. Harini P Shetty. Her dedication, professionalism, and genuine care had made all the difference in our journey to parenthood.\n\nWe will forever be thankful for Dr. Shetty's kindness and support.  Dr. Harini P Shetty will always hold a special place in our hearts as the doctor who helped us bring our precious baby into this world.",

To start the scanning they asked me to go to toilet and come back. By the time I came back from washroom they let another patient inside, again i waited for another 15-20 min. After scanning she told there are two cysts in your ovary. Whatever tablet she prescribed before, she striked off that one and wrote new tablet. Overall 20 mins consultation was done for 3 hours. And by the time consultation was over, ultrasound technician left home so they asked me to come tomorrow to collect the report. I told them my home is far, and requested if the can send soft copy to my email. They told no. Through the consultation doctors interaction is very less *** *** *** ****** *** ****** ***** ***** And chatting with nurse about dry fruits. I asked one question but she didn't even answer properly. She is not interested in explaining patients about their condition, just prescribing tablets thats all",

We wanted to ensure that we were taking the best care of ourselves and our baby, so we sought out the expertise of Dr. Harini P Shetty at The Ovum Hospital in HRBR Layout.\n\nFrom the moment we walked into her, we were greeted with warmth and kindness. Dr. Shetty took the time to sit down with us during the scheduled appointment and explain everything we needed to know about the pregnancy guide and childbirth. She answered all of our questions and alleviated any fears or concerns we had.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, Dr. Shetty was there every step of the way, providing us with all the necessary information and instructions for a healthy and successful delivery. She made sure we were well-informed about each stage of the pregnancy, from the first trimester to the final weeks leading up to the birth.\n\nWhenever we had any doubts or concerns, Dr. Shetty ensured right guidance is provided to the new parents. Her soothing voice and reassuring words helped us navigate through the ups and downs of pregnancy, and we always felt like we were in good hands.\n\nFinally, the day arrived for our baby boy to enter the world. With Dr. Shetty by our side, we felt confident and prepared for the journey ahead. Thanks to her guidance and expertise, we were able to experience a smooth and uncomplicated delivery.\n\nAs we held our precious baby boy in our arms for the first time, we couldn't help but feel immense gratitude towards Dr. Harini P Shetty. Her dedication, professionalism, and genuine care had made all the difference in our journey to parenthood.\n\nWe will forever be thankful for Dr. Shetty's kindness and support.  Dr. Harini P Shetty will always hold a special place in our hearts as the doctor who helped us bring our precious baby into this world.",

From week 1 to week 37, she provided unwavering support and expertise, even when a breech position was detected at week 36. Her calm and understanding demeanor, combined with her meticulous attention to our medical history, ensured a smooth and normal delivery of our baby boy. A special thanks to Sister Mamatha, whose minimal exercises helped change the baby's position from breech to cephalic, making a normal delivery possible. Her support during labor was truly invaluable. I am also incredibly thankful to the PRO team, especially Sinthiya, for their guidance and assistance throughout the term, making our journey to discharge smooth and stress-free. Lastly, heartfelt thanks to the LDR and post-delivery care room sisters, including Marina and Debashri. Your care and dedication made all the difference, and I am forever grateful.",

Her clear communication and attention to detail helped relieve any anxiety that me and my wife had, ensuring that she felt comfortable and confident going into the procedure.\n\nMoreover, the support staff at hospital deserves special recognition for their exceptional professionalism and efficiency. From assisting pre surgery and post-operative care, they were always there to offer support and assistance.\n\nThanks to Dr. Harini and the entire team, she is now on the road to recovery and feeling better than ever. I would highly recommend her and their team to anyone in need of any consultation or surgical care.",

As someone who had been struggling with infertility for a while, finding the right healthcare professional was crucial. Fortunately, I found a true gem in my doctor, and I cannot express my gratitude enough for the exceptional care and expertise I received throughout my journey.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming staff that immediately put me at ease. The entire team, from the nurses to the administrative staff, demonstrated a genuine commitment to patient care. They were always attentive, compassionate, and understanding, recognizing the emotional toll that infertility can take on individuals and couples.\n\nMy obstetrician and gynecologist stood out as a true expert in the field. Their vast knowledge and experience in infertility treatment were evident from our very first consultation. They took the time to thoroughly explain the various procedures and treatment options available, ensuring that I had a clear understanding of each step along the way. Moreover, they actively listened to my concerns and fears, creating a safe space where I felt comfortable discussing my emotions openly.\n\nThroughout my treatment, my doctor's expertise and professionalism shone through. They employed the latest advancements in reproductive medicine and utilized state-of-the-art equipment and techniques. This not only instilled confidence in the effectiveness of the treatments but also minimized discomfort and stress during the procedures. They were meticulous in their approach, leaving no stone unturned to maximize the chances of success.\n\nWhat truly sets my obstetrician and gynecologist apart, however, is their unwavering support and empathy. Infertility can be an emotionally taxing journey, and my doctor recognized this. They provided unwavering support, both medically and emotionally, guiding me through the highs and lows with compassion and understanding. Their availability for questions and concerns, even outside of scheduled appointments, was a testament to their dedication to patient care.\n\nI am thrilled to share that, thanks to the exceptional care and expertise of my obstetrician and gynecologist, I am now expecting a child. The joy and gratitude I feel are immeasurable, and I credit my doctor for making this dream a reality.\n\nIf you are searching for an obstetrician and gynecologist who specializes in infertility treatment, I wholeheartedly recommend seeking out the services of my doctor. Their exceptional care, expertise, and compassionate approach make them an invaluable asset to anyone navigating the challenging journey of infertility. I am forever grateful for their contributions to my journey towards parenthood, and I have no doubt that they will continue to change lives for the better.\n\nThank you, Dr. Harini P Shetty, for being the guiding light in my fertility journey and helping make my dreams come true.",

No one was matching me with my emotions. They were all just doctors on duty. Finally, my sis-in-law referred her to me, & with hope I stepped into her hospital clinic. At her first smile itself, I felt comfortable. By then, I had passed month 3. She was so understanding & soft spoken that I felt happy & relieved that this is the Doctor I was looking for. I felt that I can now relax & enjoy my pregnancy. That is how all went on. Month after month passed & my bond with d Doctor grew like a mother & daughter relationship. Every month step by step she was like holding my hand & giving me full moral support to go for a normal delivery inspite of having gestational diabetes. At this point also my doctor encouraged me to go for a sugar free strict diet so that my child & I can have a diabetes less future. Due to this, I used to call her at odd times in d night, but still she was as understanding & soothing as always. Because of her I could cross d hurdles of myg pregnancy with ease. She would always see that I am at comfort due to which my trimesters passed without much fear. She waited for my full term to complete. I did not get d labour pains as it should be, it was just coming & going on & off. She advised us to get admitted as there was no need to wait further since d full term was over. She was always giving me moral support to go for a normal delivery only. I was also mentally prepared for it. I saw a true mother in her. My pains were coming only during d night. Day time I was fine. So, she explained to us d cons & pros & d process of inducing pain. I agreed for it, since that was the best to do at that time. The hospital room  was clean & comfortable. The admin staff & d nursing staff were also very kind & good. All d required tests were done. The next day morning I was shifted to d labour room. There I was induced d pain. By & by, d pains started. And then, it grew so much that I could not tolerate it anymore. There again my doctor gave me full support & helped me to bring my little tot to this beautiful world. Finally, my much desired Normal delivery happened in good health of baby and me. My husband & I were so full of Joy to see our First Born crying.... \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude05 And at that moment all my pain vanished & I felt that my doctor was not only a true mother in disguise but also a God incarnate to me Forever. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640 My story does not end here. Even after going back home, while we had to go to hospital for d follow-ups, I was unknowingly saying that  \"today we have to go to temple\", rather than say hospital. My family used to get puzzled \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd14as to what I am saying ??  For My Son & Me,  'Ovum Hospital' has become a Temple & My doctor, Dr.Harini Shetty has become My God  Incarnate!! Forever thankful!",

In the 8th month of my pregnancy, the doctor that I was earlier consulting with outrightly ruled out natural birth for me owing to my height. It came in as a shock for me as everything was going smoothly until then. It was then that I decided to go in for a second opinion and find a doctor closer to my parents' home. This is when I found Dr. Harini's profile on Practo and decided to meet her. It was one of the best decisions I had taken in my life. It was a joy meeting her. I was quite susprised to find a doctor of her calibre being extremely approachable and I must say she is the sweetest doctor I have interacted with till date. She is extremely knowledgeable and skilled. She heard out all my doubts and anxieties with utmost patience and explained to me in detail of all the possibilities that we had at hand. She did not rule out normal delivery although it seemed difficult.  She was available on WhatsApp and on call despite her busy schedule. On the day of the delivery, when my water broke, doctor told me to immediately get admitted. I was tested positive for Corona, but she and her amazing staff made sure everything went well and that I don't panic. She assured me that she would try for normal delivery as much as possible and finally in 5 hours time I delivered naturally. I would say God answered my prayers through Dr. Harini. Words fall short in expressing my gratitude towards her. My family and I are extremely grateful to have had her deliver my baby in such trying times. Thank you doctor. ",

I started consulting her after going through the reviews in Practo that she is very soft spoken, very friendly and has lots of patience. But this turned out to be totally false in my case. I was consulting her for my second pregnancy since January. Last Saturday due to current situation I did online consultation and she was the one who asked me to come down to hospital to show her the test reports though I had shared the reports in whatsApp. I understand the whole world is suffering from the pandemic and never deny to it. I just told her my kid is feeling lonely and that's the reason I'm trying for second child. It's my personal view and I hope nothing wrong in it. *** ******* ******* ** * **** *** ****** * ****** ****** *** **** *** ***** ******** *** **** ******* **** **** ******* *** **** ****** **** *** **** *** ***** ******** * ** ***** **** **** *** **** **** **** ******* **** *** ** **** *** **** *** **** * ***** **** ******* ****** **** **** ******** ** *** ********** ** **** **** ******* ******* ****** ** ** *** ** ****** ******* * I really was trembled by her talks and never thought a doctor with 97% rating in Practo would behave like this and use such comparisons and words. ** ** * *** * ***** *** **** **** ***** *** ****** ** *** ** *** **** *** ****** **** ****** ** **** * ** **** * **** ********** ****** *** ** *** **** **** *** *** * ***** **** *** *** ****** *** ****** **** ****** ** ** *** ****** ******* ******* \nI just walked out telling a sorry to her though there was no fault on my side as I was completely shocked at that moment. \nPlease Practo don't delete or restrict my comment here.

Happy to have choosen Dr Harini as our consultant. My wife is blessed with a healthy baby girl (Our Second Princess). Certain Good traits that, we would like to share:1. Very down to earth person (She is a kid nature, there is absolutely no attitude, such a sweet person), Always with a smile on her face when we enter her room. 2. She shared her mobile number at the first visit itself. We are very happy with the way she answered the calls or a WhatsApp message. She is ready to answer your call anytime. Just in case she is busy or missed your call (which rarely happens), she will give you a call back immediately. At some point she even answered the call during the sleep. 3. Depending on the BMI of the patient, doctor focuses more on Diet. With her guidance, my wife was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy weight gain. With each visit, she used to spend a good portion of time in advising what diet needs to be followed. 4. A Good Listener, she patiently hears all the questions that you have and gives reply after you have completed asking your questions (She does not interrupt you in between). 5. With her gesture and soft spoken nature, you  can ask her all your doubts. she is ready to reply to all of them. She spends a good amount of the consultation time with each patient. There is absolutely no hurry. 6. The care taken by the doctor during the C-Section Procedure was great. Again not in a  hurry, she carefully does the procedure. We did not have any issues in the care provided by the doctor. Thank you Doctor for the care. With that care, my wife was able to walk the next day of C-Section.Thank you Doctor for everything. We wish you a happy life of good health and prosperity.Regards,Pooja and Sunil.",

Our pregnancy could be one of the most complicated but our doctor's expertise eased it out to a large extent. Not only, her understanding of Gyne protocol is outstanding, her experience of diagnoses is superb. She knew before hand, what is coming ahead that's the reason she was able to save my pregnancy irrespective of multiple admissions due to one problem or another. We always felt that we are in safe hands. \n\nI cannot forget the day of my delivery, which was not a planned one. Doctors were on strike and I developed the complication. We called her in late evening, told her about the problem and she was not in hospital. In ten minutes we were in hospital and staff was waiting for us with a stretcher on entrance. As soon as we reached there, all arrangements were already made and in next 15 minutes, Dr. Harini was there. In next 15 minutes, C-section was done. That shows the responsibility that she and her staff owns which is the most important aspect for us. Than baby was born with complications and he had to be in NICU for a long time. Till the time, baby was not discharged, Dr. Harini kept on taking feedback in back-end from Pediatricians, which is another efficient team. We are really thankful to the staff of Ovum hospital, they treated us so well from the time of admission to discharge. They listened to us, understood our point and helped us in every possible way.\n\nHighly recommended Doctor with superb staff and a professional hospital\n       \n",

Dr. Harini made me feel comfortable and relaxed and explained me that there is no need of caesarean right now and we can wait further.\n\n* **** ** **** ***** ** ******** ******** *********** **** **** ******* **** **** **** ** ** ********* ***** ** ***** **** *********** ** **** **** ** *** **** *** ** *** ***** ********** **** *** ******** ** **** **** *** ***** ***** **** ** *** ********* ***** **** **** ***** *** ** *********** *** *** ** ******* ** *** ** **** ********** I JUST WANT TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE THAT IT WAS NOT THE CASE WITH DR HARINI. SHE WILL TRY HER BEST FOR A NORMAL DELIVERY AND ALWAYS READY TO TAKE CALLS AND GIVE SUGGESTION ANY TIME.*** **** **** ******* ******* *** ********** ** ****** **** ********** **** ***** ********* *** **** *** **** *** ******* I had the sense that this doctor REALLY cared about my whole being and not just the only baby delivery. \n\nAdditionally, I could tell that Dr. Harini has a well-rounded medical background and approaches his care with a western and Indian perspective, not the typical medical \u201cfix it and get rid of it\u201d approach. \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Harini who values patient\u2019s health and gives holistic view to get the best result.\n\nThanks a lot, to Dr. Harini for her valuable advice when it was required the most.\n(Hemlata & Rajesh with our baby Mishty)\n",

She always welcomes us with a smiling face and explains all our queries patiently and in friendly manner. She explains about the diet, do\u2019s and don\u2019ts during the pregnancy and educates us with medical terms. She is such a dedicated doctor that she gives her phone number to the patients and accepts calls anytime on the day.\n\nShe remembers patient medical history very well just from the look of the patient. My wife had a white discharge during the pregnancy period which can cause pre-term labor. She diagnosed it on time and treated it with proper care. She advices exercises based on the medical condition of the patients.\n\nBaby weight had grown little more in the 38th week than expected. My wife being short was very difficult to deliver it normally. Even after 39 weeks, my wife did not get any labor pain, so we admitted her in the hospital to apply gel to induce the pain.\n\nHarini mam was constantly examining the cervix space and she got the pain after 24 hours. My wife was very scared of normal delivery, but I insisted her go for normal delivery. My wife could not bear the labor pain and asked for epidural injection. But Harini Mam suggested that she will unnecessarily land up in C-section if we suppress the pain and gave us full support and cooperation. My wife delivered a beautiful boy baby normally after 2 hours of struggle. My wife was not that supportive for normal delivery, but still Harini mam made it possible. Our sincere thanks and greetings to her. My wife had more blood loss than usual. So, she had to stay couple more days in the hospital. She made frequent visits till my wife\u2019s health was normal and took care of her with complete care and affection till the discharge. \n\nAll the duty doctors, nurses and support staffs are very supportive and caring during our stay in the hospital. There were around 4 doctors and 5 nurses at the time of delivery. Our sincere thanks from the bottom of heart to all of them.\n\nWe will never forget Harini mam in our life and would definitely recommend the doctor for pregnancy check-up and delivery.\n\n-Harish & Vigneswari\n",

Doctor also referred us to Lamaze classes in ovum.\nAt 39 weeks, also i did not receive any symptoms of labor and pain, so doctor examined by taking a scan and told to get admitted, so that they can induce pain by applying gel.\nI got admitted morning around 6.30 A.M and gel was applied, Labor pain started around 8 a.m. and it was there for almost 2 and half hour. \nAs the cervix was thick and contractions dilated only around 2 to 3 centimeters, doctor told we would wait until evening so that cervix becomes soft for head to come out.\nAround 8 Pm my water broke and i was shifted to labor room immediately, though i got very good pains and good symptoms of natural delivery, my cervix was still thick and same 2 to 3 cm.\nDoctor did not go to home and waited in hospital whole night, she was continuously checking once in 2 hours. Doctor arrived at 4 A.M and determined that I would need a C-Section, as cervix was thick and dilated only 2 to 3 cm and baby would not be able to make the \u201cturn\u201d. Also, due to water break lot of fluids had gone and baby\u2019s heart monitor slipped out of place several times sounding the alarm.\nThank you for recognizing and making us understand that I needed to have an emergency C-Section, your quick decision & analysis of the situation likely saved my life & baby\u2019s. Thanks to anesthesiologist, pediatrics, nurses , ultrasound technicians, laboratory and staff for all your support.\nMy baby could see the light of the day becoz you kept awake all night for my delivery. Around 4.37 am doctor delivered the baby safely and baby's weight was around 3.44 kg with cord around the neck. \nWe can\u2019t \u2018thank you\u2019 enough for making our family complete by giving us the little baby joy to our life. Will ever be thankful and grateful towards you.\n-\tMadhan & Arunika\n",

As she is very friendly in nature, approachable and such a down to earth person. With what ever problem we go, I get a lot of confidence as soon as I see the Ma'am itself. The way she listens the problem and the way she responds/explains each and every aspect is remarkable and it helps me in creating a comfort zone.\n\nThe best part of the doctor is that she is available at all the time. She is very knowledgeable, highly experienced and listens to the problem with very patiently and responds accordingly.\n\nOn overall journey with Ma'am, she shouted on us once for a good reason. Ma'am suggested to maintain constant weight ( Not to increase weight ), but it did not happened and I put on weight, for this reason she was angry on us. Still we see the care on her angry and we understand Ma'am shouted on us for healthy baby and smooth delivery which is expected too.\n\nNow, this is my second pregnancy c-section along with the tubectomy, Which went really well without any issues. I am able to walk comfortably on the 3rd day of c-section itself.\n\nThere is no second thought, Overall we had great experience. Once again, Thanks a lot Ma'am for the care and love shown on us on both pregnancies.\n\nThanks,\nPrasanna & Siva.",

Already had lost our first pregnancy due to cervical incompitence without any knowledge of the issues. At the right time we got to know about Dr. Harini she suggested us to take few blood test before planning for second pregnancy we followed her guidance and got pregnant. She treated us with full care and expertise during our entire pregnancy.  Dr. Harini suggested us to have cervical stitch procedure on our 14 week of pregnancy and to take bed rest for few days after the cervical stitch procedure with her personalised advice and high quality care everything when well. With the blessing of god and professional help of our Dr. Harini we are blessed with a baby girl. Thank you Dr. Harini for making this happen we are very grateful to you and we are glad that we got to know you doctor. I would highly recommend Dr. Harini Shetty to anyone for those who are waiting for their dream come true journey in their pregnancy.",

Everytime there was any issue, she was transparent with the information. She heard all my queries, concerns, doubts and fears with positive attitude and helped me also maintain the same. The pregnancy journey is v.long along with post pregnancy duration and maintaining a positive attitude through out at times gets difficult with lot of stress from personal and other side of life, but with support of doctor like Dr.Harini things gets sorted. The close to 1yr journey becomes smooth sail. towards end i lost the energy/patience but she kept encouraging me and helped me with normal delivery. I'm very thankful to her when i think of the labor time where i for once changed mind to go for c-sec but she kept encouraging and finally it was normal. She is amazing person and support in the form of doctor for any women to have throughout their pregnancy journey.\nThanks a lot Doctor for being the support i would have always asked for during my journey.",

As we neared the due date baby was gaining weight and we decided to get induced at 37 weeks 5 days. \nOn the day of induction everything went well and I started getting good contractions but wasn\u2019t dilated beyond 4cm. We waited till next day morning , my water broke but the dilation was still slow. I was not able to bare the pain any further and by noon we had to move ahead with an emergency C Sec. \nWe are happy that we chose Dr Harini as it requires one to make a decision at the right time and Dr definitely has the expertise and always makes you comfortable even when there is lot of pressure around. \nWe are extremely happy that we met Dr and i would highly recommend Dr to my near and dear ones. \n\nThank you Doc for being there with us :).

I really like the fact that she didn\u2019t get me to undergo unnecessary tests or redo tests that have already been done. She was very approachable from the very beginning and answered all my questions without any frustration. Up to my date of delivery she was very patient and very understanding and insisted that I go for a normal delivery. During the delivery and even after the delivery she was always very supportive. She gave very good suggestions in all aspects including diet and exercise and preparation for the delivery mentally and emotionally. I was really comfortable seeing her from the very first appointment, and I would really like to thank her for the wonderful experience. I am really glad that I met Dr Harini Shetty.\n\nShe talks from a lot of experience and it was very easy and comfortable to listen to her advice because it was always based on the facts that she would explain to us.",

She  simply knows what is best for you. Right from treating my PCOD to conception and the 9 month of healthy pregnancy to normal delivery I have had the right guidance, help and support from her. I was diagnosed with PCOD and was trying to conceive since 3years she guided me with right diet and weight loss of 10kilos and I was pregnant as followed and even during pregnancy she had kept me in track with just 12 kilos of weight gain and healthy throughout because I could be prone to diabetes. Advised me good physical activity and exercises for a normal delivery.. she is the only doctor who had given me her personal number and regardless of what time I have called her she has always responded. I had 56hours of labour and she stayed the entire time  without leaving or sleeping. She is truly dedicated to her profession and her patients. Blessed with a baby boy. I can\u2019t thank her enough because conceiving and bringing a baby into our life is the most important part and gift of life. It was all possible only with the guidance she provided. I consider her having as my doctor was a great blessing. It\u2019s an immense joy that I have been in the right hands from beginning. ",

It's rare to see a doctor like her with down to earth attitude.Though I had weight and bp issues the confidence and the positive vibes that she gave me and my family gave us lots of hopes and helped me for normal delivery. She has been very supportive and understanding even during my labor and I would like to thank her for preparing me and supporting me for a normal delivery of my baby boy on 11th of Oct 2019.She clearly understands our nature of work and suggests diets exercises and other routines that can be followed in real time. We are really grateful for the care and concern and her smiling attitude that she shows on every patient. I would recommend Dr. Harini for pregnancy check up because of her friendly nature ,her care for the patients and the way she clearly explains the issues to patients.Most importantly she doesn't scare us even if there are some issues. She patiently explains us how to overcome the pregnancy issues if any. Thanks a lot Dr. Harini from Lekha, Bala and Baby Thanvik",

My end to end journey of pregnancy and delivery was very soothing both medically and mentally which I was very much voching for. She helped us deliver our bundle of joy through normal delivery which is less common in these days. The way she handled us was amazing and throughout the journey she took care like my own mother. She is such a delightful person and dedicated doctor you truly are an inspiration for us! We couldn't face any difficulties to connect with her because she always available through phone or whatsapp.  I would recommend about Dr Harini Shetty for people looking for an excellent Gynecologist in Bangalore.\n            Thanks a lot Dr.Harini Shetty for everything and making my pregnancy a beautiful journey!

There have been several times she has literally shouted at me like my school teacher while gaining weight , but also appreciated the small improvements I got into my lifestyle following her advice .I have no clue how but such an esteemed , expert  doctor is available 24/7 on WhatsApp.  If there is something urgent according to her don't be suprised if she calls u to come by making herself available. She also never hesitates to double check with other doctors just to make sure she makes the right decision for me and my baby.I got operated by her and somehow I never felt any unmanageable pain at all post my c section. She continuously keeps checking on the mother first and then the baby .Last but not the least my entire family is forever in debt to her for making sure our angel arrived safely on the earth side \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",

She takes all necessary actions on time to make things better at each stage. she is good mentor too. I will definitely recommend my doctor to anyone. Ma'am is good at fetal medicine as far I have noticed in my case my husband being doctor n myself find her really experienced in this field as she takes required steps n stage of my pregnancy and I'm almost due for delivery very soon.... One more important thing is that Ma'am always gives try for normal delivery unlike any other doctors who directly recommend c section  if your body really capable to go through that normal process. And always she is reachable on mobile easily and almost available on anyday for consultations. Thank you .Shalini R",

Her aura, knowledge sharing, politeness, the way she presents herself is so nice that I was convinced I wanted this doctor for my pregnancy term. During the whole term, she was approachable, remembered all my details before I visited her. I have experienced a fantastic 9-month journey under Dr. Harini's supervision. Thank you doctor for being so amazing throughout my pregnancy, to be honest, I have not been the easiest patient since this was my first pregnancy!! I was frightful and asked way too many questions. She answered all my questions in great detail and with tremendous patience. From advice ranging from medical to lifestyle to hints and tips, Dr. Harini was always available to help and share. She is personable, compassionate, and extremely thorough in her approach to medicine and her speciality in gynaecology. Even post delivery she has always been available to answer my queries. Its a joy to know you doctor. If you are visiting Dr. Harini soon, be assured you are in good hands!",

I was so disturbed and after visiting about 4 doctors I just randomly had a self thought to visit Dr. Harini while sitting at Ovum hospital. Unlike getting advised for treatments with IVF or IUI she first corrected my diet and asked me to workout and lose weight as well and assured me that was sufficient. There I was!! Naturally conceived in 7 months as she said. Even throughout my pregnancy she watched my diet and weight gain with so much care and concern.\nDelivered a baby boy in 2017 and now blessed with a baby girl (2019).\nBoth by normal delivery. 1st labor was 3 days long and she patiently stayed until I delivered, which I doubt many wouldn\u2019t consider having so much patience and dedication towards a patient. She\u2019s been an immense support and has always cared like a family. Known her for 4 years now and she\u2019s always available on her personal number regardless of day or time. She always says everything is gods will and yes one such blessing was getting a doctor like Dr. Harini.\n\nForever thankful. \nAnush & Sonia.",

She is very approachable, friendly & listens to our concerns very calmly and provided the suggestions, and she always puts a smile on her face, which makes the patient very comfortable.  She recommends minimum tests and medicines. She is always available over phone for calls & messages for advice's, reports & reviews.Basically, she made our pregnancy a very smooth sailing & enjoyable experience, resulting we delivered a baby girl on the 7th of October, 2019.The overall experience has been fantastic, and we enjoyed our parenthood to the fullest.We are incredibly thankful to Dr Harini & definitely would like to recommend her.

She encouraged us from the very beginning towards normal delivery recommending good diet, exercise and rest. Towards the end of my term she examined me and found out that I was just ready to deliver and suggested to get admitted. Because the NST showed no contractions, I insisted on getting natural pains and not induce. When I went home by night I started getting pains exacty as she predicted. When we called her at night she reached the hospital before us and prepared everything so that we went to the labor ward directly without wasting any time. That was a very kind gesture on her part. As a person, she goes the extra mile to make you comfortable and to support you. I wonder how she can have so much patience with so many patients who visit her. I would definitely recommend her to anyone who wants a peaceful experience of giving birth. She is unlike many doctors we have seen in other hospitals who were business/money minded. Thanks a ton Dr. Harini for your wonderful support and expertise.",

She has given the most Valuable gift of life to me- My Baby Akshita.\nWe visited Dr Harini 1st time when we thought that we are expecting but clear result was not coming in the Home Pregnancy test. I visited her and shared the problems and other history. We were really tensed but Dr Harini with her smile made us comfortable and patiently listened to all our worries and gave the solution for those. She has the SOP for all types of cases and very clearly explains all the things which are going on. \nShe gave us her personal no. and told to contact any time we feel her need. Yes, She was always just a Whatsapp message away from us.\nShe remembers each of her diagnosis which she was giving to her patients and always used to boost morally. She is very particular on the diets and weight gain during pregnancy and used to monitor closely which helps in normal delivery.\nAt the end of 9 months we were blessed with a cute little girl- Our Baby- AKSHITA.\nThanks a ton Dr Harini. Thank you so much.\n\nWith Love\nKomal and Ashutosh with our baby- Akshita  ",

Throughout my nine months I have had very smooth pregnancy even though there were couple of complications and these were taken care of and managed well.  Her focus is a healthy baby and mother and that shows in her treatment and the way she handles each situation.  Through diet and simple medication my diabetes was kept under control and even my sugars turned out normal after couple of months. I did not take insulin like other cases due to my diet and sugars being monitored. Also she has an amazing way of explaining to patients very gently and calming them in any tense situation.  I ended up with a c-section due to low water levels and the cord around the baby's neck but i was taken care of well and i have a lovely healthy baby boy. All thanks to Dr.  Harini.  She is an asset to any hospital she works in and she is a blessing for all her patients.  A pleasant and good human being.  Good to have met and known you.  Thanks Dr.  Harini for all the care throughout this journey.  ",

Found out she sits in OVUM which is very near to my place. Today we are happy and glad that we had consulted one of the best doctor in Bangalore as most don't stand close to Dr. Harini Shetty.  Doctor is very gentle and understanding. She shared her personal contact number on the 1st day itself. We went through different tests. She didn't ask for all tests to be done at once, instead one after other in a set plan by checking the need. It was just 3 months when she shared the happy news with us. Every time we used to visit the Doctor she brought more positive vibes, build trusts and confidence. She listens to us no matter how much time we used to take and always explain the next step. She has been very supportive and understanding throughout. She is very patient to provide complete details on the issues,  treatments and next plan of action. Also, she is available on phone and WhatsApp whenever required, even during odd times. Kudos to the Doctor. She helped bring back the haapiness in our life. Thank you so much Doctor. I strongly recommend everyone having fertility issues-  have yourself consulted with Dr. Shetty.",

Dr. Harini  has been a fabulous person since my first counseling appointment till the delivery and even further\u2026 \nMy 9 months of journey was quite remarkable with her. Every appointment with Dr. Harini was indeed very healthy, she treated and took care as if own mother throughout the pregnancy. Although, I had few scary instances during my pregnancy but her support, treatment and kind words were very supportive. She is very approachable, whenever I called her to discuss any issue she was there with her suggestions. Once I called at 3 AM to report labor pain and she answered my phone call. I always wanted to deliver normally, she stood by with me and extended all possible moral support and to do list. Finally I delivered normally a healthy baby. The team she has of front desk, sisters, scan doctors is really great. I was not sure on my decision that Ovum will be right Hospital for me but I guess its Dr. Harini who could help creating the belief. Certainly, there would be many other good doctors in this hospital but since I got operated by her  - *** *** **** *** *** Thanks to Dr. Harini P Shetty !! \n\n\n\n",

She's not like other doctors who are there for 9 months of your delivery and then they are done.\n\nShe's very good she keeps a track of your pre and post delivery . Even after so many days of delivery she makes sure we come for check up if a patient needs extra care she gives that hundred percent \n\nWhat ever requests we had as per our request she allowed us . \n\nThank you very much Dr Harini Shetty.\n\nThankyou for helping us with a healthy baby boy and making sure the mother is taken good care.\n\nThanks for all the advise that you gave us a family member and it is helping us a lot",

During our first meeting mam was very busy and we didn't got time to talk so much but as the pregency progressed mam was very cooperative and friendly. I used to get all instructions about my diet,excercises in detail. During my second trimester mam used to spend more than half n hour to explain about do and don'ts. My in laws wanted me to go to native for delivery but mam gave us so much hope that she will do normal delivery and asked me to stay back in Bangalore. When I got admitted in hospital in the night, mam came to check at 2.30PM in the midnight and stayed whole night in the hospital next to my room which was phenomenal and not expected from these days doctors. My parents and my in laws were moved to this. At one stage after my water broke when I had severe pains my mom requested to do C section but mam said \" No, we will do normal delivery\". She followed all protocols perfectly and finally gifted me a beautiful Baby Boy. My father in law who himself a Pediatrician was really impressed and finally happy with my decision of getting delivery here. For me Mam is Visible God who helped to make my dream come true. Really happy to say that Dr.Harini Shetty Mam did my delivery and am her patient.\ud83d\ude00 Always remember you mam..Thank you for giving us our bundle of joy and love your sweet smile and ofcourse your sarees.Highly recommended for everyone who wants normal delivery with outmost care.",

I tried for baby for past 5 years & visited various doctors, but no luck (I miscarried 3 times). \n\nFinally/luckily we got Dr. Harini, she given proper treatment to conceive. She analysed very well & found exact problem for miscarriage. Based on her analysis, she started her treatment ( she explained exact cause and then started her treatment). After 4 months of continuous treatment, I got conceived & last week I delivered boy baby. During pregnancy time, she had given proper care and guidance (important scans, blood tests etc.,).\n\nShe answered all my queries ( even in late night ) without any hesitations. She was very polite and gentle. \n\nAlways her smile talks more, while entering into her room, she will welcome me with big smile. She is good in treating infertility problems, I strongly recommend Dr. Harini Shetty.\n\nThank you so much mam for helping us mam. We are very thankful to you.\n\nThanks,\nSangeetha Vijayakumar",

I had gestational diabetis and thyroid issues. She took care of my medical condition with utmost care. She personally did all the early pregnancy scans by herself and had complete and close monitoring on the baby development.  There were some times in the course of pregnancy that I was on insulin for few days and she asked me to call for every single meal to monitor my sugar levels. She never hesitated to pick up calls and answers any queries offline whenever needed. By 37th week of pregnancy, the scan reports were not pleasing on the amniotic fluid levels, The levels were very low. So she personally did the scan by herself and decided to go on labor on the same day. Here also, we are very much pleased with her approach on the delivery and supporting me to cope with with the pain. I had a normal delivery on June 2016. We heartfully thank her for all the support and guidance. \n\nOvum hospitals is the best hospital in Banaswadi for Women and child care. We got utmost and promt response and services from reception and scan departments. Meenakshi from management helped us during the admission and discharge processes.",

She is very dedicated doctor.She gives her phone number to the patients and answers the call almost all the time and clarifies the doubts on call. She remembers patient medical history very well just from the look of the patient. I had miscarriage in my last pregnancy ,so for second pregnancy she took care of me very nicely  from 6 weeks.I was adviced for bed rest . Till 5 th month I was given with injection enclex 40 to stop the blood clot . Later since cervix was short I was given with proluton depot injection. I had white discharge during the 38 th week of pregnancy.She diagnosed it on time and adviced exercise for normal delivery .I was very much scared for normal delivery but she built lot of confidence in me for normal delivery. In 39 th week I was admitted at 2  am  in the hospital . Cervix was just 2 cm opened. Harini mam was constantly examining the cervix space and I got the pain at 2 pm.I could not bear the labor pain and asked for epidural injection. But Harini Mam suggested that I will unnecessarily end up in C-section if we suppress the pain and gave us full support and cooperation. Finally I  delivered a boy baby normally after so many hours of struggle.Our sincere thanks and greetings to her.She made frequent visits till my health was normal and took care of me with complete care and affection till the discharge. All the duty doctors, nurses and support staffs are very supportive and caring during our stay in the hospital. There were around 2 doctors and 5 nurses at the time of delivery. Our sincere thanks from the bottom of heart to all of them. We will never forget Harini mam in our life and would definitely recommend the doctor for pregnancy check-up and delivery.

She handled our 36 weeks pregnancy with gestational diabetes in a very good manner.\nShe explains all the medical terms in right way and educates us very nicely. In one word, we can say she is a Genius gynecologist.\nInitially, We had in treatment with motherhood Hospital till 35 weeks of pregnancy having a problem of gestational diabetes. But due to incorrect dose of diabetes medicine, my wife went to \nhypoglycemia. I told the Doctor of motherhood Hospital about that but she did not trust and totally ignored us and told to go for next dose or meet Endocrinologist otherwise delivery will be very difficult.\nAfter that , We decided to change Hospital. Changing a hospital in 36 weeks of pregnancy is a very risk task but we did. We took appointment and met Dr. Harini P shetty  in Ovum Birthing Hospital ,Bangalore on 23rd Oct . She accepted our case and heard all our problem  with a lot of patience. She made 2-3 important test and growth scan and next day Dr Harini told us to admit asap due to gestational diabetes, large fetal growth and cord around the neck of baby as the condition of wife was not good. She admitted and kept my wife on observation for 1 and half day, controlled high sugar level and on 26 Oct ,Dr Harini operated (cesarean) and my wife delivered a healthy Baby boy.\nThank you so much Dr Harini mam for helping us. We are very thankful to you.\nRegards\nSujeet/ Utkarshini\n",

A very friendly and knowledgeable person with down to earth attitude. I have never come across a doctor who smiles and talks to her patients anywhere we meet. My experience thoughtout my pregnancy was seamless and I thank doctor for bringing my lil champ to this world through a normal delivery. A person who gave me confidence from day one that I should only think about normal delivery . \nMy husband loved coming with me for each consultation and also wanted to be there during my delivery. Doctor was friendly and all the time we had questions it was addressed patiently. Thanks to her entire team- nurses, staffs and the hospital for all the support you provided us during our visits and stay.",

Within 3months I became pregnant with her treatment. During pregnancy also she has taken a special care for me as I have too much of vomiting. I think none of the doctors are this much patience now a days. She will answer all our doubts with patience and keep smile in her face. She has given her personal mobile number and asked as to call any time if I have any problem.***** ********* *** ******* **** **** ******** *** **** *** ***** ********** ** *** I had never seen a doctor is calling their patients and asking for their health situations. She will make us comfortable and will never force us to do or take unnecessary tests or tablets.\n\nNow I had a beautiful baby girl(Emeset baby - the name given by mam \ud83d\ude03). I really thankful to you mam. And one main think I have to mention here, with doctors care, the nurses in Ovum hospital are very very caring and patience. I really appreciate their dedication.\n\nI recommend few of my friends to Dr. Harini for pregnancy and almost all had a very good experience with her.\n\nI'm really very my thankful to you mam.

It was my first pregnancy and we were confused about which doctor we need to consult. ***** ********* *** *** **** ****** *** ****** ** **** * **** *********** ******* we came across Dr.  Harini's profile and decided to consult her. From day one she took great care of me and my baby. She guided us throughout the pregnancy, gave us suggestions at the right time and helped us to take right decision about the complications arrived during pregnancy. The first 8 month's of pregnancy was a wonderful journey with Dr. Harini. However I had to move to native since there was no one to take care of me at Bangalore during last month of pregnancy. Even then Dr.  Harini assured us that she will be with us throughout the pregnancy and we can contact her any time if we have any confusion. Finally all her effort came through on 19/01/2018 when my little princess came to this world through normal delivery. I am extremely thankful to both the doctors who were with me during this journey and I hope everyone should get a doctor like Harini Ma'am and Dr. Sujaya(doctor from my native) so that complicated pregnancy could also be turned into a safe and wonderful journey.

Even though she has so many patients, she remembers the detailed history of you and your medicines. I had to go through an emergency c section and she gave me all the confidence I needed for it. She even made sure that I talk to the paediatrician about the welfare of my baby. She was checking up regularly on the day and I had my bundle of joy perfectly delivered by her. I would recommend Harini mam 10/10.",

The communication between her was good and makes comfortable. She examine the history carefully and deeply why I was not getting pregnant. She has a good experience in the field and tried her best for the best results. After consulting for 3 months, I finally got pregnant normally and it was the best moment for my life as it was a dream come true after 4 years. I had some complication in 2 months and Dr Harini really help me with her experience and it got fixed. I will recommend Dr Harini to my friends and family as it gives good results consulting with her.",

Also, she was very supportive for normal delivery from the beginning and taught me to start exercises from the third trimester to turn my breech baby down.   I had a normal delivery  at 39 weeks and our baby boy weighed 3.6kgs. This wouldn't have been possible without Dr. Harini and we are very grateful for her. She also provided great postnatal treatment. I strongly recommend Dr.Harini and trust me you will be in good hands.",

Harini madam took utmost care of me and my health and encouraged consultations over phone wherever possible. It was her knowledge and expertise with high risk pregnancy care that helped me deliver my second angel as a late preterm one. I wouldn't have had such a smooth pregnancy and delivery without Harini madam. She is such a heart warming person with caring words and attention towards her patient's concerns and problems.

We're in confusion whether to go for amniocentesis as there would be abortion risk involved in this test. But Dr. Harini Shetty quickly recommended us to Dr. Prathima of BFMC and convinced us that we can go for the test without second thought. Finally we have a healthy baby girl  and happy. We really thankful to Dr. Harini Shetty for her advise throughout pregnancy period and during delivery. ",

I knew her since 2017 from my first pregnancy, I had a wonderful experience with her and that is why we chose to go with her for my second pregnancy as well. She is not only an expert in her field but a caring and genuine person.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy period,  she was polite, took time to explain the things and gave us the moral support. she always addressed our concerns patiently and when we visited her in person or through messages, she always responded on time. We wanted a normal delivery this time as well, she encouraged and guided me what are the exercises and food habit I have to follow so that the pregnancy will go smoothly. Under her supervision and guidance I had a normal delivery. \n\nWe are pleased with her professionalism and efficiency in delivering her duties . I would surely recommend the Dr Harini to all ladies:)\n\nThank you and God Bless Dr. Harini",

She provided us with the diet, she is still on our speed dial, very hard working Doctor. \n In short, If any loved ones in my family I will hands down recommend Dr. Harini. Kudos to all the efforts, all the comfort  and she was so kind to answer all our questions and inform us with a detailed summary.  I ask a lot of questions at times it might be very lame or might be bit annoying. But Dr.Harini was kind enough to answer them all.

Can't thank sister Mamta enough who taught me to excercise and prepare my body for labour. Other nurses were very helpful during my labour and didn't allow me to give up till the end. There are very few genuine doctors like Dr Harini who keep up their word and are keen on doing normal delivery instead of pushing the patient for c-section. I would happily recommend her to anyone who is looking for a good delivery experience.",

She remembers patients and their problems well. she has always been supportive and guides us correctly. She takes decisions promptly. Our parents always have a thought that in private hospitals, even if its normal delivery is gonna happen, doctors choose c section just for many sake. But Harini ma'am is not that kind of person. she has always tried her best to do normal delivery.  She is a go to person. One can trust her completely as she always cares for our well being. She is a very good experienced doctor and I have suggested her for many of my friends and received positive feedback for her. May God bless her for the promptness and positive attitude in her profession. ",

My wife had to go for LSCS (Cesarian) delivery as we came to know during 40th week of pregnancy that the baby is in antipeto posteria position and also the baby was heavy which might make normal delivery more painful and risky.\n\nOverall we are very happy with the treatment given by Dr. Harini and I strongly recommend her to those who are  looking for good gynaecologist.",

She prescribed the right medicines to make sure nothing goes wrong. She listened to us everytime very carefully and solved all the issues. She gave good nutritional advice every time I met her which helped a lot. Suddenly my AFI level dropped in 32nd week and she gave lot of supplements and it was maintained till 37th week. Because of that our baby wasn't born premature. I had a very smooth c section delivery with no issues and the baby also was healthy and gained weight thanks to her. \nAs a person, she is very caring and understanding. She makes sure she listens to you. You will not feel that you're not heard. She doesn't get angry with our questions even though we asked a lot of basic questions again and again. Overall, we are happy that we went there. \nThank you doctor for helping through the difficulties as we were worried because of my health conditions. ",

But at 36 weeks I got covid positive then she stood with us and gave very positive hope to fight against it. Mam was available anytime at just one call/msg away. She used to respond for each and every doubt throughout our pregnancy. And on the most important day i.e., on the delivery day she came to us around 1am in the early morning and helped us to take right decision for going with c-section and blessed with beautiful baby boy. I would like to thank you mam from bottom of our heart. Me and Siva would be always blessed to have you as our gync. Thank you wouldn't be sufficient to express our feelings.",

Now after my marriage I got convinced naturally because of that approach. She fills the conversation with all positivity and explain the situation perfectly. She shared her number in the first appointment itself and always responds to my WhatsApp queries. Looking forward to have a fruitful pregnancy under her Guidance.",

Maam, went through case history and all test reports in detail. She discussed and suggested all the do's and dont's  very well. Must say Ma'am is very polite , humble and treat patient patiently. Faced some last minute complication in delivery, but Ma'am handled the case very professionally and my wife was kept under close observation to take suitable decision under any circumstances. She was very much involved and supportive during all these time.Baby was borm premature via c-section, both mother and baby are fine and doing good.Not only in OPD but even you had a sudden interaction here& there in the hospital she does not forgets to ask the well being of the patient and family.Ovum hospital staff is also very supportive, well maintained and treatment is cost effective.I recommend Dr. Harini and Ovum hospital.Thanks.",

Dr.Harini mam handled each situation gracefully and was cordial through out. Best part we liked about the doctor was she listened carefully to our concerns, understood the situation and handled labor and delivery in a very committed, responsible way. She clearly explained each development and discussed with us on the next step. I strongly recommend the doctor. Totally happy with the service",

But doctor helped us very well to understand the situation and made us comfortable. we are 12 kms away from hospital but we don't want to change hospital just because of harini.

Providing information and supporting all the means. She is very efficient and well competent in her work. Being it from initial days of pregnancy test to delivery she helped and took care all the ways, always available even on calls as well when it was quite late or some other doubts were there. She made the 9 months journey so easy with her good professional ********* and great personal nature. Would suggest her as the best i have known as a doctor. Now a days Normal delivery is not common but because of the confidence Mam has shown my wife delivered normal, though we were scared because It was our first experience and we wanted to avoid all the complications but due to the efforts of Harini Mam *** *** ***** ********* we skipped all the abnormal things and are proud parents of a baby boy.

She is highly approachable and I felt very comfortable while communicating with her. Her personal concern was evident in her attempts to keep following up even over WhatsApp. Over my course of treatment, I ended up growing very fond of her.

She is very clam with the patients and make sure to explain all the treatments she is gonna perform and issues we have. I was referred by a friend to her and she was a good choice for us. She always took personal care on me by making regular phone calls and watsapp messages to check my status even after delivery. She is obviously an expert in her field and never take risks on patients blindly. She analyses the situation very well before taking any decision. I would definitely recommend patients to her. However the hospital's service was not as good as Dr. Harini's service.",

Doctor Harini handled my case very carefully, she prescribed required supplements , advised to eat food rich in iron and I was under utmost supervision. Finally I went into labor and Dr. Harini arrived at hospital as soon as we gave a call.  with Dr. Harini\u2019s care I had a normal delivery.  Even during the labor pain Doctor\u2019s bedside manner was excellent.  Pushing part was very easy with doctor\u2019s suggestions. ",

Harini mam took note of everything regularly and kept on motivating for normal delivery.All the ovum nursing staff are really caring and helpful. This is our first baby so we required a lot guidance and support  for post delivery care of mother and kid for which both Harini Mam and nursing staff was readily available.

Here, most challenging part for us was to decide whether we should continue with her or shd we move to our native as we all know for any pergrent lady first three months is very crucial .\n  But, friends I was absolutely right with my decision . Dr. Harini was a class apart. She never treated my wife as patient. She was like a friend. The way she kept us at ease was appreciable. My  wife had urinal infection as well as a small cyst in her stomach but Dr. Harini never made us feel that as a major problem. Even though Dr. Harini was aware that for delivery we would be going to Kerala, she was still the same till end and never hinted or forced us to opt any particular clinic in Bangalore.\nThank you Mam , the medication you gave for the first three months was a saviour . We are blessed with a beautiful angel . \nI strongly recommend all the lovely to be moms to consult Dr. Harini Shetty. \nRegards\nPadmaraj and Saranya",

I feel fortunate to have opted for her as she is a doctor with ethics and professionalism.\nShe has lots of patience to listen from the patient and she gives her valuable advice and treatment as required(not unnecessary medication). She had given me her contact number from the first day itself. She has answered every time I have called(even at night 3 O' clock) her regarding any issue. I had gestational diabetics and urine infection issue in my 3rd trimester. She handled my case very well.  On the day of my delivery she waited, motivated and guided me to have a normal delivery (although I was willing to opt for a C section for an easy escape). I felt a warmth with the way she handled my case with a personal touch. I recommend Dr. Harini because of my personal experience with her. Also I recommend the OVUM hospital for the very good maternity care and experienced staff. ",

She is very caring, nice speaking and very frank ( not tried to hide anything ). Initially we thought she is extra precocious, but understanding the critical pregnancy case for my wife she was handling the case with lot of care. My wife she had a problem of gestational thrombocytopenia, where her platelets count was going down during this time. With the continuous consultation and observation, we were able to make the right level of platelets during her pregnancy.  \nNot only that, during the last few weeks of her pregnancy, in 3 days of time her platelets came down from 1.4L to 75K(approx), so she has given a advice to go for surgery ASAP. But prior to the surgery she had consulted senior general physician for opinion. With proper observation and care she has operated my wife and now we are blessed with a baby girl. \n\nI would really like to thank Dr. Harini mam for this. \n\nMy Mom who knows very little English, but the way Dr. Harini was taking care of my wife, she was also praising her saying that she is very nice.",

As I am sure you are aware, identifying this difficulty is time consuming, emotionally difficult and to be honest, at times embarrassing. Dr. Harini shetty answered all of our questions and never rushed us through an explanation (she will give sufficienttime to explain and understand). Dr. Harini shetty was always kind and patient with us, encouraging and understanding when our hope was less during failed attempts. Dr. Harini shetty is an amazing care giver who provides best support and continually stands by you. I could go on and on about the kind words of gratitude I have towards Dr  Harini  shetty however I will simply end by stating that you have an exceptional good doctor on your team and I hope that you are aware of how amazing it is to find compassion in today\u2019s often jaded healthcare system.Dr. Harini shetty helped us to bring our bundle of joy to our world and our gratitude will never lessen. Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.",

We were trying for a baby from last 7 years and we almost fed up with difficulties faced during these 7 years and we almost lost our confidence.  But last year we got to know about  Dr Harini from some of my relatives and  immediately we consulted her with a little hope.   But the  first day when we met her,  our little hope became our confidence . Its amazing the way she boosted up our confidence with  her small lecture :-)  to overcome the difficulties when we are waiting for  some great thing in our life.  By Gods grace , within a few  months,  my wife became pregnant not just because of her medication but also the  confidence which she built in our mind.  By this experience we decided to continue with her till delivery. \nIt was an excellent experience the care she has taken during entire pregnancy period. She is very easily reachable and approachable in entire period.  She taken care of my wife like her own family member and keep on boosting up confidence in every difficulties which we have faced.  For each every small issue which we faced during the pregnancy , she was keenly analyzed and solved and she made our long waiting dream become true.  Once again thank you so much madam. \n\nI strongly recommend this doctor.",

I was little worried to change the doctor at last trimester but after meeting her she made me really comfortable and decided to deliver with her . I could not have found a better doctor than her. She is very caring  and patient to listen to all my queries. She has shared her personal no. and is very much approachable at all times, even I called her at 4am morning and she answered my call immediately.  Now I m blessed with a baby boy. It was a ceaserin and I am really grateful to her the way she made me comfortable during my delivery. Because of her guidance my delivery  was so smooth that I always felt safe throughout. I really thank Dr. Harini for all her care and support and would recommend her to everyone looking at smooth and safe pregnancy.",

Round the clock team of pediatrician shown a fantastic care for the baby. For every becoming parents we recommend Dr. Harini Shetty in Ovum Hospital, Bangalore. Also, Not but not the least the staff especially Ms. Debora was showing personal care in allotting the rooms after delivery and Ms. Mamtha for her care during labour pain.

Very down to earth person, there is absolutely no attitude which is amazing. \n2. She shared her mobile number at the first visit itself. We are very happy with the way she answered the calls or a WhatsApp message. \n3. She spends a good amount of the consultation time with each patient. There is absolutely no hurry. \n4. The care taken by the doctor during the C-Section Procedure was great. She was available for us in midnight as it was emergency and she stayed until myself and baby was fine.\n5. As It was preterm delivery, she took upmost care and also instructed nurses to take good care of both of us.\nI am really glad that I choose Dr. Harini for my pregnancy period.",

She postponed the birth for 36 weeks by carefully monitoring the sugar levels and assisting me at every stage of pregnancy. Finally I gave vaginal birth to my baby.

As much as possible she goes only for normal delivery and safety of the mother and child is given priority. C-section only in absolutely necessary cases. Unecessary  medication or medical intervention during delivery is also avoided as much as possible. Very friendly and always available on call even if not at hospital. My experience with Dr. has been very good one. I delivered a healthy baby boy on Jan 7th. Thank you to Dr. Harini and the entire team. ",
