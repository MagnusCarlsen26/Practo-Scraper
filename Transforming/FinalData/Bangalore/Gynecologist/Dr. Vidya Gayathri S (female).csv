Based on feedback from one of our friends we switched to Dr. Vidya Gayathri. Dr. Vidya Gayathri was not only knowledgeable (e.g. she detected and treated a rare infection which was missed by previous doctor) but also very approachable, polite, patient, available on WhatsApp for instances where we need doctor's opinion (as this was our first pregnancy, their were numerous instances where an ""Ok"", ""It's normal"" brings down your anxiety). Towards 7th month of pregnancy my wife had ""Obstetric Cholestasis""; to address this she clearly explained us the complications involved along-with monitoring the LFT levels closely. To my astonishment, she even remembered the critical numbers related to the treatment, reports. There has been instances where-in we had numerous queries, she addressed each with a medical reason which helped a lot to bring down the anxiety. Finally, we were blessed with a baby girl last month and I truly treasure and recommend her as a doctor and individual. Be rest assured that you are in safe hands!
