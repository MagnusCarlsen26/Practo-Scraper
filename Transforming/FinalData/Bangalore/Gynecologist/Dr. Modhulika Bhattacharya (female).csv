"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy Tests,Pregnancy Scan,Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,YES,"Dr Modhulika is a very positive person and instills a lot of confidence in her patients.

I first consulted her (in Cloudnine) for pre-pregnancy counselling since I was above 35 and it is termed as high risk pregnancy. When I shared my age related worry, she told me 35 is normal these days since women are career oriented and like to embrace motherhood in 30s.  Also that it is not a magical number post which our health starts declining and problems suddenly crop up, it is more a factor of overall fitness and lifestyle. I felt a lot more confident hearing this and she also suggested taking some tests and scans before planning which I did. 

I would prepare lots of questions before every consultation and she would patiently answer them. She was always available on mails for any additional questions/ concerns or advise. Throughout my pregnancy she gave me a lot of positive vibes. While discussing my delivery options, she clearly laid out the pros and cons keeping my medical history in mind, let us decide and supported our decision. 

I was very nervous on the delivery table but when I saw Dr. Modhulika and her ever smiling and confident face, I felt comfortable that I was in great hands. I delivered a healthy baby boy and thanks to Dr. Modhulika for a wonderful experience overall. 

I highly recommend her.",2022-06-27 12:42:48,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
