At 36 weeks my water bag broke and she suggested I reach hospital immediately. she examined and said we will try for normal delivery and she really did. To my surprise dr. vijaya and a whole supporting team(junior doctor and nurses) of Apollo cradle helped to me to have normal delivery. I only had my husband next to me at the moment and due to pain I had given up on having normal delivery. but the team talked me through the pain and helped me have a normal delivery. I will always be thankful for her and the team. I never knew or believed doctor's put so much effort for normal delivery.",

She used some spoon like steel article and literally pushed it inside me. It was awfully painful! She said you need to pass urine and it won't pain after that. I obeyed. She did the same thing again. This time I couldn't take it any further and had to tell her to stop digging inside me.By this time, I already had tears rolling down my eyes.  Looking at me, she said, ur married for so long, all this shouldn't hurt! Can you imagine the insensitivity!  After this she inserted her gloved finger which was also painful and that is when she finally had some mercy and used some gel onto her finger to perform the physical test. \nIn my opinion, she could have at least used the gel from the first time itself and shouldn't have to wait for me to ask her to stop!! I had read good reviews about her but I should have noticed that only pregnancy cases had given good reviews!\nGo at your own risk and with mental preparation to be tormented at some really sensitive parts of your body!",

She also recommended her own lab which resides in the same premises. The horror began then. The staff is very shabby and iI wouldlike to believe incompetent. M pretty sure they did not go through even a basic training. They pierced the needle incorrectly into my wife's am and tried drawing blood. Failed and induced a lot of pain. Tried again after taking the syringe out and re inserting. Failed again.. More pain... \r\nThen they resorted to the palm area. Drew a few drops of blood and misguided the needle again. This time they tried inserting back the blood along with air into the veins. My wife felt as if a lightning struck her hand  and the pain was excruciating. They took out the needle and we're ready for another try. I lost my cool and stupid them while my wife ws cryingin pain. All this just to draw blood. After that,  iI hadto rush my wife to another hospital to get this treated. She wd keptunder observation and then under medicines till now. Been close to 4 days and she is still not able to work properly with her hand and taking pain killers.  M planning to sue them. Any pointers are appreciated. Please be aware before visiting this place.    ",

They have people walking in, plus they have Practo appointements. How will the doctor manage?\r\nAnd seriously you have give 15-minute slots of appointment. Do you guys realise that gynaec problems take a lot of talking and diagnosis? How will the patient move over to the next?\r\nMy appointment was at 8 pm, and I was finally called in at 8.45. And the doc was clearly in a rush to go home because the clnic closes at 9 pm. It's not her fault. But there were just so many patients waiting for her still. \r\nYou must ask them to cap the number of patient visits.\r\nAnd please ask the admin/receptionist not to enter the cabin when the patient is talking. A patient is aggrieved, he or she wants a doctor's total attendance. \r\n",

I only had my husband next to me at the moment and due to pain I had given up on having normal delivery. but the team talked me through the pain and helped me have a normal delivery. I will always be thankful for her and the team. I never knew or believed doctor's put so much effort for normal delivery.",

She used some spoon like steel article and literally pushed it inside me. It was awfully painful! She said you need to pass urine and it won't pain after that. I obeyed. She did the same thing again. This time I couldn't take it any further and had to tell her to stop digging inside me.By this time, I already had tears rolling down my eyes.  Looking at me, she said, ur married for so long, all this shouldn't hurt! Can you imagine the insensitivity!  After this she inserted her gloved finger which was also painful and that is when she finally had some mercy and used some gel onto her finger to perform the physical test. \nIn my opinion, she could have at least used the gel from the first time itself and shouldn't have to wait for me to ask her to stop!! I had read good reviews about her but I should have noticed that only pregnancy cases had given good reviews!\nGo at your own risk and with mental preparation to be tormented at some really sensitive parts of your body!",

She also recommended her own lab which resides in the same premises. The horror began then. The staff is very shabby and iI wouldlike to believe incompetent. M pretty sure they did not go through even a basic training. They pierced the needle incorrectly into my wife's am and tried drawing blood. Failed and induced a lot of pain. Tried again after taking the syringe out and re inserting. Failed again.. More pain... \r\nThen they resorted to the palm area. Drew a few drops of blood and misguided the needle again. This time they tried inserting back the blood along with air into the veins. My wife felt as if a lightning struck her hand  and the pain was excruciating. They took out the needle and we're ready for another try. I lost my cool and stupid them while my wife ws cryingin pain. All this just to draw blood. After that,  iI hadto rush my wife to another hospital to get this treated. She wd keptunder observation and then under medicines till now. Been close to 4 days and she is still not able to work properly with her hand and taking pain killers.  M planning to sue them. Any pointers are appreciated.

But there were just so many patients waiting for her still. \r\nYou must ask them to cap the number of patient visits.\r\nAnd please ask the admin/receptionist not to enter the cabin when the patient is talking.

One thing that we like about her is that she wouldn't give medicines unless required. She wrote us many optional medicines and asked to have only and only if some problem happens like if u have frequent vomiting have this tab, one odd is fine. Second best thing i liked is that she gave us tests request which is required for next visit. Usually you will see that you visit the doc, she gives test and u visit again. Even before 1st visit, we had called her, she adviced not to come  come without ultrasound done else consultation would be of no use. We liked that approach as it same both our time and her time as well. ",
