My wife was diagnosed with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during her 4th month and had major breathlessness everyday post evening hours. Due to her pregnancy most of the top pulmonologist could not start her treatment except for giving nebulization remedies, which did not give much relief. We were consulting in another hospital but due to distance was keen to get the delivery done within Electronic City. Then we came to know about DR. Sandhya MR, she was with Motherhood and had just shifted to Cloud Nine Electronic City at that time. She is definitely an extraordinary doctor and went beyond her protocol to help, support and guide us from Day 1. It was our 8th month and we started consulting Dr. Sandhya, my wife was in bad shape by then due to her COPD issues and complete lack of sleep at night. I was more worried about my wife and DR. Sandhya was definitely god in disguise whom we happened to consult all of a sudden, and from then there was no looking back. She is one of the most efficient gynecologist I have ever encountered and best part was she was always reachable 24 / 7 to guide us. This was our 2nd child and my wife delivered successfully under the able supervision of Dr. Sandhya M R. It was a very complicated case, with all chances of complications like drop of oxygen level, breathing issues. Dr. Sandhya M R confidently planned well in advance and was all prepared to face all scenarios. She got few emergency equipment procured from nearby multi-specialty hospital, regards to pulmonology support. However with god\u2019s grace, delivery was hassle free and we owe a lot to Dr. Sandhya M R for same. I recommend her to all would be mother\u2019s, *** ** ********** *** ** *** *****  Extremely professional, friendly and an EXPERT in her job! Thank you doctor!\n\n",
