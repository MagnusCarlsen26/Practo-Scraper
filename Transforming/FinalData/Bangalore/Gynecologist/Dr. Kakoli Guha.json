When I found out I was pregnant with my first kid, I was a mix of excited and nervous, you know? But the moment I met Dr. Guha, all those nerves went out the window.\n\nHer office wasn't just a waiting room; it was like a safe haven. Everyone, from the receptionist to the nurses, made you feel like you were among friends. And Dr. Guha? She was like a beacon of friendliness and warmth.\n\nOnce, during my second trimester, I freaked out over some weird symptom late at night. I thought I'd leave a message, but guess what? Dr. Guha answered the phone herself! She listened, asked questions, and calmed me down. Having a doctor who's there for you, even after hours, meant the world to me.\n\nAs my due date got closer, I realized Dr. Guha wasn't just good at her job \u2013 she was amazing. Every checkup felt like a chat with a knowledgeable friend. She explained things without making me feel uninformed, and her genuine concern for my well-being was pretty darn comforting.\n\nWhen it came to the big day \u2013 the delivery \u2013 Dr. Guha was a rockstar. Labor is intense, right? But her encouraging words and calm vibe turned the delivery room into a positive space. It wasn't just about the medical stuff; it was personal.\n\nLooking back, I'm so grateful for Dr. Guha's friendliness. She's not just a doctor; she's like that friend you can count on. I'll never forget the support she gave me, and I feel lucky to have had her by my side. Dr. Guha isn't just delivering babies; she's delivering genuine care and friendship. She's the real deal!",
