                "review_text": "Well there are so many good qualities and traits which \nDr. Bharati possesses, I'm wondering from where I should start. So this is my pregnancy story. During my first trimester I changed 3 doctors and the last one was **** ********** * *** ******* ****** When I did my first anomaly scan with the motherhood doctor, all parameters turned out to be ok but the doctor highlighted that I have short cervix - 2.5 cm and I have to undergo a procedure to get it stiched immediately. After hearing this both me any my husband were tensed and that was the time we decided to take a 2nd opinion. It was in Jul'18 when we came across doctor Bharati kamoji in Aster CMI. During our first visit we explained dr. Bharati about our situation and she patiently heard us out for almost an hour. That is the first quality which we admire of dr Bharati that she patiently hears all your concerns. Well then doctor Bharati advised us that anything <2.5 cm is considered as short cervix and in our case as it is exactly 2.5 cm and moreover there is no funelling and the cervical length doesn't change and stays same throughout the pregnancy (our previous dr didn't explain anything about this) so there is no emergency. With this advise it gave us strength and motivation for our pregnancy. This is the 2nd quality of doctor where she doesn't forces her patient and rather understands the problem and then advice. Bharati advised us to monitor the cervical length upto 21 weeks and if length remains same then we don't have to worry and we can sail through your pregnancy. We did a weekly cervical check with dr Bharati and there was no change in cervix length and moreover there was no funelling and hence no surgery was required. With this the 3rd quality which Dr Bharati possesses is being genuine which these days is rare to find in any doctor. These are only few examples which I gave, there are lot of things ex. Normal delivery guidance etc. for which Dr Bharati guided us in right direction. We were keen for normal delivery and my due date was 18 Nov 2018. I went into labour on 06 Nov and my husband immediately rushed me hospital and thanks to god Dr. Bharati was available that day in hospital. I got myself admitted and during the check it was observed that there was a complication where meconium was released. Usually in such cases, instead of observing the mother and baby, doctor advises C section but in this case dr. Bharati kept me under observation where she checked mine and my baby's heartbeat and then took a decision to go with normal delivery. I was under pain and my husband asked Dr Bharati if I can be given epidural, but dr Bharati knew whats she is doing. She new that we had reached the fag end of labour and she advised us not to take epidural because anytime NVD can happen. Hats off to dr Bharati. Her decisions were so calculative which led to NVD. *** **** *** **** ** ********* *** ***** **** ** ******* ********** she can handle any kind of pregnancy complications. Well thank you doctor so much for being with us through our pregnancy as a friend, as a mentor, as a doctor. ******* *** ****** ** ***** *** ** *** ** *** **** ************ ** ****** I strongly advise people to visit dr. Bharati for your pregnancy related matter. \ud83d\udc43",

All were good but we were still skeptical and were not feeling confident. But after meeting Bharati Ma'am for the first time we were sure that we will be in safe hands. She is 10/10 in her work, understanding of new tech and making this journey comfortable.She was super meticulous in her diagnosis and had a crystal clear plan of action. She was not ambiguous in decision making. She explained everything in such simple terms even my mother was very confident about getting laproscopic operated by her. operation went smoothly, painless and 2days we stayed in hospital so after discharge my mom got back to her regular activitiesThe best part is Bharati Ma'am always responds to the phone calls and WhatsApp messages also no matter how busy she is.In short, if you are looking for a experienced, cool *** ******* ****** **** *** ** *** **** ** **** *** ** **** And I'm sure you also will definitely share such a long & positive feedback like me :)",

From the outset she was very progressive, discussed our birth plan in detail and gave us a lot quality time to discuss our questions despite her busy schedule. Her consideration for our birth preferences coupled with her clarity in medical decision making gave us confidence even when we were not sure of outcomes.  She really supported an NVD right till the end, and tried every safe intervention possible for an NVD until finally discussing the c-section option. Her objectivity and considerate decision making makes is confident that we made the right elective choices in our pregnancy.   A fantastically competent doctor that we would highly recommend !!!  ",

                "review_text": "Well there are so many good qualities and traits which \nDr. Bharati possesses, I'm wondering from where I should start. So this is my pregnancy story. During my first trimester I changed 3 doctors and the last one was **** ********** * *** ******* ****** When I did my first anomaly scan with the motherhood doctor, all parameters turned out to be ok but the doctor highlighted that I have short cervix - 2.5 cm and I have to undergo a procedure to get it stiched immediately. After hearing this both me any my husband were tensed and that was the time we decided to take a 2nd opinion. It was in Jul'18 when we came across doctor Bharati kamoji in Aster CMI. During our first visit we explained dr. Bharati about our situation and she patiently heard us out for almost an hour. That is the first quality which we admire of dr Bharati that she patiently hears all your concerns. Well then doctor Bharati advised us that anything <2.5 cm is considered as short cervix and in our case as it is exactly 2.5 cm and moreover there is no funelling and the cervical length doesn't change and stays same throughout the pregnancy (our previous dr didn't explain anything about this) so there is no emergency. With this advise it gave us strength and motivation for our pregnancy. This is the 2nd quality of doctor where she doesn't forces her patient and rather understands the problem and then advice. Bharati advised us to monitor the cervical length upto 21 weeks and if length remains same then we don't have to worry and we can sail through your pregnancy. We did a weekly cervical check with dr Bharati and there was no change in cervix length and moreover there was no funelling and hence no surgery was required. With this the 3rd quality which Dr Bharati possesses is being genuine which these days is rare to find in any doctor. These are only few examples which I gave, there are lot of things ex. Normal delivery guidance etc. for which Dr Bharati guided us in right direction. We were keen for normal delivery and my due date was 18 Nov 2018. I went into labour on 06 Nov and my husband immediately rushed me hospital and thanks to god Dr. Bharati was available that day in hospital. I got myself admitted and during the check it was observed that there was a complication where meconium was released. Usually in such cases, instead of observing the mother and baby, doctor advises C section but in this case dr. Bharati kept me under observation where she checked mine and my baby's heartbeat and then took a decision to go with normal delivery. I was under pain and my husband asked Dr Bharati if I can be given epidural, but dr Bharati knew whats she is doing. She new that we had reached the fag end of labour and she advised us not to take epidural because anytime NVD can happen. Hats off to dr Bharati. Her decisions were so calculative which led to NVD. *** **** *** **** ** ********* *** ***** **** ** ******* ********** she can handle any kind of pregnancy complications.

Since that day every meet with doctor has been soo pleasant and she always makes u feel very comfortable and guides you during the entire 9months.. She understands the complications and prescribes medicines accordingly... Even wehenevr i sent her any message she has been patient enough in replying back to my queries offline.. Since my case was little complicated and I had to undergo emergency C-sec she was beside me in the OPD calming me down and giving me moral support taht everythg would be fine . Throughout the 9months of my beautiful journey of pregnancy it was a real pleasure meeting you doctor :-)  Good Luck !!\n\n\nThanks,\nMysara\n",

You are really understanding, calm, humble in taking care of the issues we speak to you and provide solution with ease. You make all problems look small when we speak to you. We were not able to call our parents due to Covid-19, but Dr Bharti told us, no problem just you and your husband are enough for delivery and she was also there. She followed up continuously with the duty doctors on my condition And i was taken to labour room at 3 , we didn\u2019t expect at 5am at peak of my delivery that also at with just 1 phone call she will come to hospital and she was really there at the time of delivery. I really have no words to express as to how happy i was to see her in the labor room at that time. Frankly, how super super happy i am with your consultation and support. My best advice is if you are planning or already in your pregnancy, you can definitely consultant Dr Bharti without any fear and it will be wonders. And now for lifetime i will consult  Dr Bharti for anything and everything.",

Our first kid was delivered by \u2018C\u2019 section due to low amniotic fluid. We are wishing to get this one through normal delivery. When we consulted Dr. Bharati she calmly listened the whole issue and addressed our concerns. We have put lot of questions to clear our doubts and doctor has never got tired to answer us and very patiently addressed all our doubts. During the 9th month Doctor kept my wife under weekly observation to monitor amniotic fluid levels which was at margin tending towards low levels and personally monitored it. When we enquired about VBAC (Vaginal Birth after C-section), she promptly and clearly gave us pros and cons of it. Hence, it really helped us to decide on it.  Once we decided for VBAC she reassured and supported us to go for it. During delivery she supported my wife and made it possible to delivery through VBAC.  These days it is very difficult to see woman getting a normal delivery but Dr. Bharti has ensured to get VBAC even though risks are higher than normal veginal delivery. I am very thankful to Dr. Bharti for it . She is one among the best gynecologist in Bangalore. I strongly recommend consulting her for any pregnancy related issues\u201d\n",

I want to share my wonderful experience I had with Aster CMI Hospital while I was stepping into a new world of parenthood. I & my wife started the journey 38 weeks back with Dr Bharthi Kamoji, every visit I had Dr Bharthi explained me and my wife about the steps involved in pregnancy and the various stages, She has loads of patience to listen to us and guide in each and every step of pregnancy which made me /my wife very comfortable, we are very lucky and thankful to God that we had DR Bharthi for all the trimesters.",

Baby was not in position for normal delivery, but she gave me some time and suggested how the baby could be brought in position in next 1 hour. I had a NVD with a 4kg baby,  which is not so common. We are extremely thankful for coming in contact with her, and In the whole duration of pregnancy, she guided us very well. ",
