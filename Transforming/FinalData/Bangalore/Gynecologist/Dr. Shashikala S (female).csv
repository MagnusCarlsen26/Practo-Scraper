,,0,0,Yes,My wife had met the doctor and it was for pregnancy related. Consultation was fine by the doctor. I can surely recommend doctor to my family or friends circle. She is satisfied with the explanation and treatment given. There was not much waiting time in the hospital. We are consulting since last 3 years. Tests was done. Doctor was friendly. ,2021-06-26 14:14:23,False,True,Kumar,,,
