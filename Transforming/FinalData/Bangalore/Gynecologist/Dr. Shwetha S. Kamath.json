The gynecologist we were consulting prior to and during pregnancy was truly a blessing and had provided us with a lot of confidence and support throughout. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the doctor was not going to be available for delivery, and this caused us a lot of apprehension. This is when we found Dr Shwetha S Kamath at Rainbow Hospital (thanks to Practo reviews). Although we consulted her only from mid-8th month, she managed to put us at ease right from the first visit. An excellent gynecologist, who understands IVF pregnancies and provides the apt guidance. Dr Shwetha is friendly, patient and understanding, but also firm as she truly believes that her suggestions will only help better the outcome. I was more inclined towards having a normal delivery. However, the doctor advised us to go for C-section considering my age and baby positioning. At that point of time, I did feel a little disappointed; but now I truly believe that Dr Shwetha guided us correctly as the final scan did show that the baby was in transverse position and insisting on a normal delivery would have only caused distress to our baby. We are blessed with a beautiful baby girl, and when I see the little one\u2019s bright smile, we cannot thank Dr Shwetha enough for doing her job right (indeed a credit to her profession), for being patient, understanding and firm with me.  Thank you doctor; we are extremely grateful. ",

Due to Covid-19 we delayed the procedure for so long.  My mom got total knees replacement 12 years back and she is obese due to this reason all the Gynics in  my hometown suggested  to visit Bangalore. I searched Practo for best Gynics that\u2019s where I came across doctor Swetha Kamath, and my confidence grew after seeing her  tv interview on laparoscopic surgery. We visited Swetha Kamath and after discussion she suggested to go with Vaginal hysterectomy.   As my mom is obese and got Knees replaced, I am hesitant to move ahead with the procedure, but the doctor convinced me that she will take care and no need to worry. Keeping confidence on her words we went ahead with Vaginal hysterectomy for my mother a week back.\n The operation was  success, and my entire family was very happy with the outcome. My mom started walking from day 2 and she looks quite normal as if there is no operation done and all my relatives are surprised with such a fast recovery. My family is very thankful to doctor Swetha Kamath for making it such a smooth transition.\n\nOverall doctor Swetha Kamath is very skillful, and people can blindly believe on her, and she will take care everything. Also, doctor is reachable on phone and messages which makes us ever more comfortable.\n\nOnce again thank you very much Doctor, we vow you.\n\nI also want to thank Practo for making the information available.\n",

I first met her when myself and my husband decided to have a child but i was having pcos and thyroid issues. With my first consultation I was happy the way she addressed issues and she gave me a few medication so that i can conceive naturally. But due to the sudden demise of my father in law I couldn't follow up on things. Later after around 6-7 months I found out was 5 weeks pregnant . It came as a surprise but myself and my husband were worried because both of us were tested positive for covid just before 2nd lockdown. I had a miscarriage and during this course of time Dr. Shwetha was very supportive. And within 3months i again conceived naturally with her guidance and she lead me all through my pregnancy now blessed with a healthy baby boy. And i must say I have troubled her with the slightest of the changes calling her at odd times of the day . And she has addressed my issues always with a smile and the right explanation. ",

We visited Swetha Kamath and after discussion she suggested to go for the Surgery.As my Mom is old she was not comfortable to undergo Surgery but the doctor convinced me that she will take care and no need to worry. Keeping confidence on her words we went ahead with Surgery.\n\nThe operation was success, and my family was very happy with the outcome. My mom recovered fast, Dr Sweetha Kamath shared her personal number and was available on call when we needed her this gave lot of confidence to my Mother her super fast recovery. My family is very thankful to doctor Swetha Kamath for making it such a smooth transition.\n\nDr Swetha Kamath ** **** ********* *** listens to patients concerns and address all questions, She provides brief explaination before the surgery and after surgery follow up has been very good and she take's care of everything. \n\nBig plus point is Doctor is reachable on phone and messages and i have shared her reports and on whats app and she has responded quickly.\n\nGood to have Doctor's who care for Patients, Keep up the good work Madam.

I was very disheartened and disturbed. Doctor took care of the procedure very smoothly and supported me through the procedure patiently. She was a big emotional support as well in that difficult time. She gives so much attention to each and every problem and talk to you like a friend. We planned the next pregnancy with doctors advise. I always wanted a normal delivery bcz I have seen my mom struggling with the side effects of C section. When I was on the labour bed, there was a time i couldn't push. I had given up all hope and there was no strength. 5 more minutes and I was to be taken to the OT for C section. But doctor Shwetha came to me like an angel. My husband tells me the Doctor rolled up her sleeves up, got on to the side of the delivery bed and helped me push the baby out literally. Now I have a beautiful baby boy. I cannot thank the doctor enough for all her efforts for being such a big support throughout my pregnancy. I recommend the doctor to all the would be mommy's out there.",

It is so easy to find a doctor in a city like Bangalore and equally challenging to find a right doctor whom you can trust with all your might. We consider ourselves lucky to be referred to Dr. Shwetha Kamath by a family member. She is everything that a woman wants her gynaec to be. Kind, generous with her time, listens to everything that we have to say and then diagnose and offer practical solutions. Even after being occupied with work for most part of the day, she makes sure to respond to our calls/texts which distinguishes her from other doctors I have seen and heard about. \n\nWe visited the Doctor as we were planning for pregnancy for a long time with no success. I was diagnosed to have fibroids in my uterus which was possibly the reason why I could not conceive. Doctor advised us to undergo laparoscopic myomectomy to remove the fibroids. The surgery was successful and now I am recovering with a positive vibe that everything from now on will be as beautiful as we want it to be.\n\nI would like to thank Dr Kamath for everything that she has done and will be doing in the coming days to help us achieve our purpose. Highly recommend her.\n\nI \n",

The key has been the remarkable amount of patience in listening to my concerns, and then carefully explaining the diagnosis and the required treatment. She recommended laparoscopic surgery to treat the endometrosis. She also carefully explained the potential outcomes and clarified all our doubts. During the surgery, there was adhesiolysis performed due to extensive abdominal adhesion that was observed.\nPost surgery recovery consultation and support was also exemplary, and she has been available on phone for any clarifications. Hence, the overall experience has been very pleasant and i would definitely recommend Dr Shwetha Kamath for any of your gynecological/obstetric needs.\n",

The gynecologist we were consulting prior to and during pregnancy was truly a blessing and had provided us with a lot of confidence and support throughout. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the doctor was not going to be available for delivery, and this caused us a lot of apprehension. This is when we found Dr Shwetha S Kamath at Rainbow Hospital (thanks to Practo reviews). Although we consulted her only from mid-8th month, she managed to put us at ease right from the first visit. An excellent gynecologist, who understands IVF pregnancies and provides the apt guidance. Dr Shwetha is friendly, patient and understanding, but also firm as she truly believes that her suggestions will only help better the outcome. I was more inclined towards having a normal delivery. However, the doctor advised us to go for C-section considering my age and baby positioning. At that point of time, I did feel a little disappointed; but now I truly believe that Dr Shwetha guided us correctly as the final scan did show that the baby was in transverse position and insisting on a normal delivery would have only caused distress to our baby. We are blessed with a beautiful baby girl, and when I see the little one\u2019s bright smile, we cannot thank Dr Shwetha enough for doing her job right (indeed a credit to her profession), for being patient, understanding and firm with me.  Thank you doctor; we are extremely grateful. ",

Due to Covid-19 we delayed the procedure for so long.  My mom got total knees replacement 12 years back and she is obese due to this reason all the Gynics in  my hometown suggested  to visit Bangalore. I searched Practo for best Gynics that\u2019s where I came across doctor Swetha Kamath, and my confidence grew after seeing her  tv interview on laparoscopic surgery. We visited Swetha Kamath and after discussion she suggested to go with Vaginal hysterectomy.   As my mom is obese and got Knees replaced, I am hesitant to move ahead with the procedure, but the doctor convinced me that she will take care and no need to worry. Keeping confidence on her words we went ahead with Vaginal hysterectomy for my mother a week back.\n The operation was  success, and my entire family was very happy with the outcome. My mom started walking from day 2 and she looks quite normal as if there is no operation done and all my relatives are surprised with such a fast recovery. My family is very thankful to doctor Swetha Kamath for making it such a smooth transition.\n\nOverall doctor Swetha Kamath is very skillful, and people can blindly believe on her, and she will take care everything. Also, doctor is reachable on phone and messages which makes us ever more comfortable.\n\nOnce again thank you very much Doctor, we vow you.\n\nI also want to thank Practo for making the information available.\n",

I first met her when myself and my husband decided to have a child but i was having pcos and thyroid issues. With my first consultation I was happy the way she addressed issues and she gave me a few medication so that i can conceive naturally. But due to the sudden demise of my father in law I couldn't follow up on things. Later after around 6-7 months I found out was 5 weeks pregnant . It came as a surprise but myself and my husband were worried because both of us were tested positive for covid just before 2nd lockdown. I had a miscarriage and during this course of time Dr. Shwetha was very supportive. And within 3months i again conceived naturally with her guidance and she lead me all through my pregnancy now blessed with a healthy baby boy. And i must say I have troubled her with the slightest of the changes calling her at odd times of the day . And she has addressed my issues always with a smile and the right explanation. ",

We visited Swetha Kamath and after discussion she suggested to go for the Surgery.As my Mom is old she was not comfortable to undergo Surgery but the doctor convinced me that she will take care and no need to worry. Keeping confidence on her words we went ahead with Surgery.\n\nThe operation was success, and my family was very happy with the outcome. My mom recovered fast, Dr Sweetha Kamath shared her personal number and was available on call when we needed her this gave lot of confidence to my Mother her super fast recovery. My family is very thankful to doctor Swetha Kamath for making it such a smooth transition.\n\nDr Swetha Kamath ** **** ********* *** listens to patients concerns and address all questions, She provides brief explaination before the surgery and after surgery follow up has been very good and she take's care of everything. \n\nBig plus point is Doctor is reachable on phone and messages and i have shared her reports and on whats app and she has responded quickly.\n\nGood to have Doctor's who care for Patients, Keep up the good work Madam.

I was very disheartened and disturbed. Doctor took care of the procedure very smoothly and supported me through the procedure patiently. She was a big emotional support as well in that difficult time. She gives so much attention to each and every problem and talk to you like a friend. We planned the next pregnancy with doctors advise. I always wanted a normal delivery bcz I have seen my mom struggling with the side effects of C section. When I was on the labour bed, there was a time i couldn't push. I had given up all hope and there was no strength. 5 more minutes and I was to be taken to the OT for C section. But doctor Shwetha came to me like an angel. My husband tells me the Doctor rolled up her sleeves up, got on to the side of the delivery bed and helped me push the baby out literally. Now I have a beautiful baby boy. I cannot thank the doctor enough for all her efforts for being such a big support throughout my pregnancy. I recommend the doctor to all the would be mommy's out there.",

It is so easy to find a doctor in a city like Bangalore and equally challenging to find a right doctor whom you can trust with all your might. We consider ourselves lucky to be referred to Dr. Shwetha Kamath by a family member. She is everything that a woman wants her gynaec to be. Kind, generous with her time, listens to everything that we have to say and then diagnose and offer practical solutions. Even after being occupied with work for most part of the day, she makes sure to respond to our calls/texts which distinguishes her from other doctors I have seen and heard about. \n\nWe visited the Doctor as we were planning for pregnancy for a long time with no success. I was diagnosed to have fibroids in my uterus which was possibly the reason why I could not conceive. Doctor advised us to undergo laparoscopic myomectomy to remove the fibroids. The surgery was successful and now I am recovering with a positive vibe that everything from now on will be as beautiful as we want it to be.\n\nI would like to thank Dr Kamath for everything that she has done and will be doing in the coming days to help us achieve our purpose. Highly recommend her.\n\nI \n",

The key has been the remarkable amount of patience in listening to my concerns, and then carefully explaining the diagnosis and the required treatment. She recommended laparoscopic surgery to treat the endometrosis. She also carefully explained the potential outcomes and clarified all our doubts. During the surgery, there was adhesiolysis performed due to extensive abdominal adhesion that was observed.\nPost surgery recovery consultation and support was also exemplary, and she has been available on phone for any clarifications. Hence, the overall experience has been very pleasant and i would definitely recommend Dr Shwetha Kamath for any of your gynecological/obstetric needs.\n",

During the course of the pregnancy we had multiple issues and throughout this process, she has been very patient in helping us over come some of the biggest hurdles and guiding us to a safe and healthy pregnancy culminating in the birth of our child. \nAs mentioned by many she is a very friendly doctor who will walk you through your concerns and answer your queries. \nOur experience with the doctor has been amazing and would definitely recommend her to anyone.",

Since I was seeing a different doctor before she went through my previous records and asked all necessary questions to analyse my case. She is soft spoken and gives detailed response to any doubts that we have. She guided through out my pregnancy and ensured her best for my normal delivery. She explained the pros and cons of both normal and c-section so I can be mentally prepared as the type delivery could be anything depending on the baby's health. Her main goal was to ensure good health for me and my baby. I'm very grateful to her as she ensured the same and I'm absolutely happy to have approached her for this important event of our life. ",

Throughout my time in the hospital, all the nurses/doctors were very supportive. Last visit of the doctor she suggested few food items I would need to take to get healthier. Though the hospital takes care of pregnancy, it is also overall woman care as well. You May visit the doctor for non pregnancy related issues as well. She is very calm and experienced. ",

As we were on a burst of joy due to most awaited parenthood. Becuase, this is the news which we got after a decade of our marriage.  We approached Dr.Shwetha.S.Kamath, a renowned Gynocologist of Bangalore city on the completion of 1st Trimester.  From there we got everyday the proper guidance from Dr.Shwetha.S.Kamath just like our own family elders.  We were really tension-free all six months and even after post delivery period. Some times, we disturbed Dr during night hours due to some emergencies and clarifications, Dr with the same care and affection attended  with all patience. Now my Daughter is healthy and one month old.  We would be always grateful to Dr for all her guidance and support in this juncture \ud83d\ude4fRegards,Vid.J S Shreekanta BhatMrs.Vasanthi B V",

Had to chat with someone from Practo to get the assistance. Clinic called at 5.30 pm saying doctor won't be able to come within 45 mins. I understand that doctors might be occupied with serious patient issues. However, when I searched the clinic on Google, it was mentioned that it would open at 6.30 pm. I'm not sure how this discrepancy can occur. Also, this is one of the very few clinic on Practo, that has mentioned, it would charge extra 50 rs if appointment is cancelled within 2 hours of the appointment. Also, there are limited number of reschedule options. When so much is expected from the patient, I'm sure we can definitely expect better from the clinic management. I had to cancel the appointment on site, and had to come back as I could not wait for 45 mins for the doctor to arrive. I'm sure the doctor is great, however, clinic management could be better. ",

From 1st month of my wife pregnancy upto delivery Dr. Shwetha guided very well, given all information that required in each stage of pregnancy and she stood by us and gave immense confidence that helped relieve our stress. Depending on my wife condition she suggested normal delivery chances are more but my wife was fear of normal delivery but Dr. Shwetha boosted her confidence and made her to prepare for normal delivery. Finally on delivery day my wife was asking for c-section again Dr. Shwetha boosted us with energy with all details( she was with us more than hour to decide on delivery) and finally my wife agreed for normal delivery . My wife and my daughter doing good. We wish a very happy and long life to Dr Shwetha for her kindness and support to her patient. She is upto date to the new technology and recent developments in the field that is the reason she is able to manage complicated cases as well. \nOverall, if you are looking for a best doctor, do not think twice..go for Dr. Shwetha.

Hence, I was confused whether or not to get to surgically removed.Dr. Shwetha recommended that I undergo laproscopic myomectomy. I was apprehensive at first, but she cleared all my doubts and concerns.She boosted my confidence levels and prepared me mentally. She eased me into the whole process very effectively.The surgery was a great success and I'm forever grateful for her.Post Surgery: Dr. Shwetha is also quite responsive on texts and calls. Thanks a million, Doctor.",

I am happy that I had no issues through out pregnancy. Doctor was ready to deliver baby normally but I had no confidence on myself about the pain and so opted for c section. Now I have healthy baby and we are happy. I highly recommend the doctor as she is very patient in listening patients issues, clarifies all the doubts with detailed explanation and worth to invest hope and money. ",

So medicine are precribed only when there is a problem.. The symptoms are however clarified and explained. \n\nUltrasound is very essential for diagnosis since we can't make out everything by history or examination..  It confirms or rules out a diagnosis..  We can confidently say whether there is problem or not only after ultrasound.. \n\nIn covid times our patient safety is our priority..  We do ask everyone their travel, fever or contact history..  It is a patients civic responsibility to co operate and not consider it staff rudeness.. Also if a patient attender is coughing,  in view of other patients safety we have to ask the attender to wait outside,  that again is not rudeness but out duty towards patient safety.. ",
