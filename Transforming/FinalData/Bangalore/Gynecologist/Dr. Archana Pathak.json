She was the only doctor we visited in our 10-11 month period, so that shows how much we trusted her and how good she was that we never thought of 2nd consultation even after complication in initial 5 months of pregnancy. We thoroughly searched for best doctor nearby and planned to visit her and she was really good. Initial days we thought she was not guiding us much, but later we realised she gives all the details, explains everything at the right time(ofcourse she cleared our doubts whenever we asked). I would highly recommend her to anyone looking a good gynaecologist. ",

She listened to all of our trivial problems with patience and provided us with much needed guidance always.\nIn my 9th month of pregnancy I started to have some complications but she always supported my wish of having a normal delivery instead of a c-section.\nDue to the complication, I had to go for delivery in 38th week itself and I firmly believe that without her confidence , support and expertise I would not have been able to do the normal delivery.\nI was in labour room for 25 hours and my labour was not progressing as expected but I always had the confidence and trust in her which helped me to go through the complete labour without much difficulty.\nHer supportive words helped me to wait that long.\nIn the labour room, the whole staff was very attentive and available throughout.\nAll the nurses are very well trained and I highly recommend Motherhood hospital and Dr Archana Pathak for a smooth and happy pregnancy journey.",

It became a bit complicated during delivery and many suggested proceeding with the c section but her right decisions even at that critical time made me deliver normally.  Highly recommended doctor.",

We thoroughly searched for best doctor nearby and planned to visit her and she was really good. Initial days we thought she was not guiding us much, but later we realised she gives all the details, explains everything at the right time(ofcourse she cleared our doubts whenever we asked). I would highly recommend her to anyone looking a good gynaecologist. ",

She listened to all of our trivial problems with patience and provided us with much needed guidance always.\nIn my 9th month of pregnancy I started to have some complications but she always supported my wish of having a normal delivery instead of a c-section.\nDue to the complication, I had to go for delivery in 38th week itself and I firmly believe that without her confidence , support and expertise I would not have been able to do the normal delivery.\nI was in labour room for 25 hours and my labour was not progressing as expected but I always had the confidence and trust in her which helped me to go through the complete labour without much difficulty.\nHer supportive words helped me to wait that long.\nIn the labour room, the whole staff was very attentive and available throughout.\nAll the nurses are very well trained and I highly recommend Motherhood hospital and Dr Archana Pathak for a smooth and happy pregnancy journey.",

She is very calm and always available to guide you even during night time as well. She helped me to manage my Gestational diabetes. Because of her expertise both me and my baby are in good health. \nI also want to thank Motherhood all staffs\u2026 nursing team, management team.. they made the whole journey very smooth. Nursing team took care of mine & baby very well. Whenever you call them they will be available to help you to the best and they are very polite. I must say choosing Motherhood Sarjapur branch and Dr Archana Pathak was the best decision and I want to recommend her to any expected mother.",

My wife had a normal delivery on 11th Feb 2021 at Motherhood Hospital, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore and the entire credit for a smooth delivery goes to Dr. Archana. \n\nWe feel blessed to know Dr. Archana. She is absolutely phenomenal! She is really down to earth, caring and so humble. She always encouraged my wife to have a normal delivery, right from the beginning of the pregnancy period. \n\nWe always wanted to consult a doctor with whom we can feel comfortable and trustworthy at the same time. When we first went to her for a check-up, we found her extremely polite. She explained us all the things in great detail. She always addressed our concerns very patiently, when we visited her in person or through messages. She gave us her personal number and always responded to our messages almost immediately, including odd hours. This gave us immense trust and confidence. She gave us tremendous moral support and motivation throughout the pregnancy journey.\n\nShe has ALL the qualities one can ask for in a Gynaec. For the 9 months that my wife was under her care, we were struck by her personal and individualized attention. She was thorough in her explanations and took her time answering all our questions, no matter how many times we asked the same question or how weird the question was \ud83d\ude0a . We were extremely impressed with her incredible knowledge, skills, experience and responsiveness, in terms of communication. \n\nShe was always proactive about addressing the various physiological conditions my wife had going on, during our regular consultations. Her expertise made us feel reassured, confident and taken care of. Dr. Archana treated my wife just like her own daughter and my wife felt so comfortable and confident, having her around. \n\nEven during the actual delivery, she was so calm and composed and did not hurry up the things. She visited us several times in the hospital before and after the delivery. Not only that, she visited my wife whenever I requested her, no matter how busy she was. \n\nWe had a wonderful, more than satisfying experience in our prenatal and birth journey, all thanks to Dr. Archana.\nWe will always be extremely grateful to her. She is truly an angel and I would blindly recommend her to everyone! Thank you so much, Madam!\n",

So planning of second child was never an easy decision. Taking one step forward and retaliating 2 steps backward before proceeding. When we came to know about the second pregnancy, the fear element was superseding our happy moments. Due to having bad experience with first doc we decided to switch over. \n\nBy God\u2019s grace we met Dr Archana Pathak. In our first meet, we felt a positive vibe. She patiently listened to our first experience and the trauma that my wife was going through for the second pregnancy. There are no words to describe the way she explained and boosted the confidence level to go for the pregnancy. (Note: She never forced us). She explained us everything we should expect during the pregnancy tenure and how to maintain a positive mindset through out. Post our discussion, we felt a sense of belonging and well being  and decided to go for the pregnancy under the treatment of Dr Archana Pathak.\n\nFrom that day till the delivery, it was a very smooth experience. We were very comfortable with her treatment. She was very approachable, listens to all your queries and explains in details, She never ask to go for unnecessary tests or medicines, always available on whatsapp for all our queries, most importantly she is very caring and understands our family commitments. \n\nHer treatment created a positive impact on my wife\u2019s heath (physically and psychologically). Finally, by God\u2019s grace and the stupendous treatment of Dr Archana Pathak, we were blessed with a healthy baby and my wife also recovered soon.\n\nPregnancy is an emotion. Its very rare to see a doctor possessing personal touch, care for patient as a person, respecting family values with outstanding quality of medical care. \n\nWe strongly recommend Dr Archana Pathak to all people seeking good gynaecologist. \n\nThank you Dr.Archana Pathak for making our pregnancy journey easy and happy.",

We came to know about Dr. Archana Pathak from some of our friends and we decided to consult her. \nFrom the first month onwards we consulted her at motherhood hospital Sarjapur road and our experience with doctor is really awesome. Very supportive during the entire period of pregnancy. \nShe was very patient to listen to the health concerns and provide suggestions on that. In the beginning itself she told us that, as my first delivery was normal she will try for normal delivery unless until there is no complications. \nWhen I admitted for the delivery, she came to the delivery room multiple times that gave confidence in me. When the pain started I even thought of doing C-section and asked her for that but she told there is no complications and there is no need for C-section. Around 8.30 PM she came to the labor room before leaving to home, after seeing the conditions she informed that delivery will take another 2 more hours. \nWhen the delivery pain started the duty doctors informed Dr Archana and she rushed to hospital around 10.30 PM and she was on time on the hospital before the delivery and I was able to deliver a healthy baby without any complications. Also from the nurses I Came to know that , As she is staying very near to hospital she prefer to be available in hospital for her patients delivery even if it is very late night. \nI am very thankful to the doctor for the guidance and care provided during the entire period which made the whole journey for pregnancy easy and happy without any complications. I strongly recommend her to all.\n",

Then after thorough research in google and seeing the reviews in Practo we chose Dr. Archana Pathak for our gynac. She was incredible throughout the pregnancy and always calm and compose when we have any queries and concerns as we are very much new to the phase. She never encouraged for unnecessary medicines and supplements.\nWe wanted to have normal delivery and followed the exercises suggested by her. But till 39 weeks also I was not feeling any labour pain and baby\u2019s head was still above the pelvis . So 2 days before the due date on 7th Nov 2023 we got admitted and thought to try one more time for normal. But there\u2019s no progress in dilation and it was still 1cm even after 11 hour of induced labour at hospital. So in the morning of 8th we took the call for C-section. Dr. Archana Pathak did the operation and we welcomed our bundle of joy a healthy baby boy.\nAs far as facilities concerned,the room was neat and clean and the staffs were very helpful and always there for everything . Food was really good.\nOverall our experience at Motherhood was great in all ways.\nThank you so much Dr. Archana Pathak for your immense support .",

Under Doctor's guidance our pregnancy journey was very smooth and successful. I delivered a healthy beautiful baby girl last month in Motherhood hospital. Doctor was always available over phone to clear our doubts and counselled us in all condition. Doctor is very supportive and never asked us to do extra scans or prescribed any extra medicines. Doctor helped us in every stage of pregnancy.We are extremely happy and luck that we met Dr. Archana. ** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ********* *** would recommend others also to consult her too.",

That clearly shows how much she cares about her patients.The doctor was always by side for any help and reachable at any hour of need during both the pregnancies. \nDuring both the pregnancies we did not have to go through any extra scans or medications, she was very conscious on medication. During the first pregnancy both of us were very scared but Dr Pathak was very patient is listening to us and clearing our doubts and calming us down. \nBoth the kids were born due to water broke and Dr was available even in wee hours of the day (around 4 AM for first and 11Pm for second) to help us out.You rarely get to see such commitment from a doctor. We are really happy and impressed by her and will always be grateful for all the help. Would recommend her without any reservations.",

Normal delivery wouldn't have been possible without your guidance and support. \n\nToday, during pregnancy I don\u2019t think we need anything more than a friendly, understanding and a supportive doctor. \n\nFrom the day one myself and my wife were searching for doctors who can promote and favor normal delivery and I know at the end it comes down to mothers and baby's health factors, but doctors can motivate and push us for a healthy delivery. \n\nLike anyone other couple, we did a lot of research, read tons of reviews and finally connected with Dr. Archana Pathak at Motherhood hospital, Sarjapura Road. \n\nMam had been very patient from the day one and helped us understand the process. She was very gentle and kind enough to explain us multiple times as we had lot of questions and confusions as this was our first baby and Dr. Archana mam never heisted in educating us. She took care of all the detailing required for a smooth and safe delivery. \n\nFor all the couples planning for baby or mothers carrying one, we highly recommend you to reach out to Dr. Archana Pathak, she is an amazing Gynecologist/ Obstetrician.\n\nPregnancy is a very important part for life and choosing the right Gynecologist will solve most of the problems.\n\n\nWe thank you once again Dr. Archana Mam. \n",

My wife had a normal delivery and it was all because of the doctor ,Motherhood hospital staff and Add-on Labs Staff. My wife had to deliver the baby almost 2.5 weeks before the due date because of some reason. She told us everything would be fine after the delivery and  it happened just like that.  My wife had to be in more than 12 hrs labor pain to deliver the baby normally. She encouraged us for normal delivery right from the beginning unless some complication arises.I liked her patience and calm demeanor all the time. She visited us many time in the hospital and was on all call throughout the delivery night with duty doctors. Again in the morning she was present at the time of delivery. She helped us getting the best gift of the God.She took our background information before suggesting the hospital. Initially we were confused but eventually it all turned out to be very good experience. I would like to recommend her strongly. Just keep following her advice blindly and everything will be fine.Thank you Doctor Archana.",

She explained us everything we should expect during each months of pregnancy and Do's and Don't s, because this was my first pregnancy. Also, she never asked to go for any unnecessary tests or medicines. She is really calm and listened to all our queries in each visits and cleared all of them. She had shared her number on our first visit itself and was reachable whenever we needed her support. I delivered my baby in feb 2022 through NVD. Her steady support and calmness during the phase of pregnancy and delivery was remarkable.We got bit complications during the labour due to the position of baby, where in general the doctors go for c-section, but we are really grateful to the Doctor that she handled this situation very carefully and successfully I had NVD. I would recommend to consult her and have a safe delivery..",

During the last month scan my amniotic fluid was little less than normal and the local hospital suggested to have steroids injection for myself and they couldn't promise for a normal delivery. They were insisting for a c section. My first baby was a normal delivery and I did not want to do a c section for my second delivery. Hence we decided to come to motherhood for a second opinion. So we read reviews about Dr. Archana Patak and found all the patients have given excellent reviews. Then we booked our appointment with Dr. Archana Patak who has got nearly 2 decades of experience and shared our concern. She verified all our reports from old hospital patiently and informed there is no risk and she was very confident that we would have normal delivery. She did not ask us to take any unnecessary tests or scan though we met her at last moment. We felt so happy and confident about her. Finally I delivered a healthy baby boy through normal delivery and returned home safely. We really thank Dr. Archana Patak for her great support and treatment provided. We would definitely recommend her and you will feel that you are in safe hands.",

I visited Dr Archana after my friends suggested. She is God-given Gift to Bangaloreans, who opt for natural Birth. I visited her in last\u00a0few\u00a0weeks. She has verified my reports and checked for complications if any. Then only agreed that normal delivery is possible. She explained everything in detail and asked me to visit every 5days to check cervix dilation. She was always available on Whatsapp to answer my queries and address emergencies. I admitted in hospital at midnight 2.30 due to pains. She patiently monitored my condition from that time.\n\u00a0The early labor lasted for 22hours due to slow cervix dilation. She didnot\u00a0hurry me, but was explaining me\u00a0the conditon every hour. Any other doctor would tense the patient and force for C-section (due to lack of time in Covid).\nFuture Mums, Please dont hesitate to visit her at any point of the Gestation period. If you have that strong willpower. You are in safe hands.",

It was around last trimester of my pregnancy and we were concerned with our current consultant (the one prior to meeting Dr. Archana). Our current consultant was of opinion that baby must NOT be more than 2.7kg for normal delivery. if baby puts on more weight, chances of normal will become seriously low.\nThis is when we started to look for options.\nFrom the time we met Dr. Archana, she was able to establish trust and connect, was able to guide both logically and pragmatically. She was straight in providing clarity when in doubt.\nHer assessment of my situation and my delivery date and time were perfect. When admitted, she was constantly in touch with hospital staff and handled my case very well. I had trouble pushing during delivery and the passage was narrow for the baby to pass. Baby's HR was dropping. Dr. Archana assessed it quickly and took measures and ensured that baby was delivered normally (assisted) instead of C-Section. She was supportive throughout the entire process and afterwards as well. THANKS A TONN DR. I'd recommend her to everyone.",

Dr Pathak took good care of all these while treating my mother. The surgery went as smoothly as one could possibly imagine. We live only 100-150 m from Motherhood Hospital and my mother could walk her way back post surgery from the hospital. This only goes to show how experienced her hands are at surgery. We were told about all the pros and cons, in details by Dr Archana. She made sure that my mother was absolutely alright before discharging her and kept close contact with me to make sure she was doing fine at home.\n\n** ******* ** *** ** *** ****** *** **** ******* ********* Her motherly attitude coupled with her patience to listen to all our queries and post-surgery doubts, made us believe in her even more. I recommend her to everyone because she will take time to understand the root of your problem and solve it masterfully in no time. We are definitely going to consult Dr Archana Pathak for any gynec issues in our family.",

When I first went to her for a check-up she was polite, took time to explain us things and gave us the moral support throughout the pregnancy period, she always addressed our concerns patiently, be it when we visited her in person or through messages, she has always responded to my messages.\nWe were more inclined toward the normal delivery and she stood with us our discussion but have also explained us all the possible outcome and what are the cases if  we need to go for C section. During the delivery day she was with us whole the time. Despite of the challenges she remain very calm and help us to get the baby delivered normally.  \nWe are very Grateful to have met her and I would definitely recommend everyone to consult her, without thinking twice. Thank you  Mam for being with us.",

She was always available even on Whatsapp when I needed to ask anything. I will never forget how she emotionally supported me with so much care when my stitches were paining a lot post surgery. \n\nI have never met a doctor who is so caring for her patients. She is very professional yet all ears for the personal issues if it might affect pregnancy adversely. She didn't let the stress of pregnancy get over me and made it a truly easygoing and memorable experience. I strongly recommend Dr. Archana. ",

Being this was our first child this information helped us a lot to make this  journey smooth with necessary care for our baby.\nDr. always shared with us which medicines she is prescribing and why, also what tests/scans  we need to do time to time and what will be expected from reports of these tests/scans. She never over prescribed any tests/scans.\nAs we were closing to due date, Dr explained us about natural as well as C section delivery and about the deciding factors for either choice. She explained pre/post delivery pros/cons of both the choices; as well as how to prepare mentally for Labour pains and choice of Epidural.\nOn the day of delivery as well when my wife got admitted, Dr was always around and constantly taking updates about the situation.\nThanks to Dr Pathak that my wife delivered healthy baby naturally. \nWe strongly recommend Dr Archana Pathak and thank her for being there with us throughout this journey.\n\n-Tushar and Yogini",

Going for our first baby, we always wanted to consult a knowledgable and experienced doctor with whom we can feel comfortable and trustworthy at the same time. It was going to be 8 months long journey with the doctor we choose.\r\nWith all this in mind we started our consultations with Dr. Archana right from 5th week of pregnancy. And I will give all the credit to Dr. Archana for a wonderful, more than satisfying experience in our prenatal and birth journey. \r\nWe felt Dr. Archana is not only knowledgable and experienced but also a very skilled and humble professional. She was always available on the phone to answer all our wierdest queries at all the times including odd hours. That gave us the trust and confidence in the doctor we were looking for. \r\nThe birthing experince was also very smooth and we were able to cherish those moments without any hicups on any fronts. We also received lots of help from her in postnatal period.\r\nOnce again thanks to Dr. Archana for the great service!!\r\nWe would definitely recommend her for any hopeful parents!!\r\n\r\n--\r\nVishwas Prabha.",

With her help we are blessed with the most precious gift of our life. She has a friendly nature due to which we never hesitate to reach out to her for any major or minor queries. Not only has she taken great care of our health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. \n\nThe main call out here is she was very supportive of us in going for a normal vaginal delivery NVD. She even agreed to our request for husband to be present in\nLabour room to support emotionally. She was guiding us with patience in the birthing process which helped us deliver our baby girl. \n\nFor anyone who is hoping to have a memorable and safe pregnancy, we would recommend them to consult Dr. Archana Pathak.\n\nSpecial mention of thanks to nurses and duty doctors who assisted us during the delivery. Their care in post labour made us feel comfortable.  \nMotherhood hospital facilities  provide comfort and care in a beautiful way for new born & new parents.",

Dr.Archana Pathak is always available on WhatsApp for any queries if we can't visit. For my 1st pregnancy, she tried alot for my normal delivery but due to uncontrollable circumstances we need to go through C-section, but with her guidance and the way she operated me i got recovered soon. Then when my 1st kid was 6months old, we got to know about our 2nd pregnancy. We went ahead with Dr.Archana Pathak for my 2nd pregnancy as well. She knew that we can't visit every month for regular check-ups considering we had an infant and we are a nuclear family plus we had shifted to Whitefield. So, she called me only during scans in the clinic along with regular check-ups and said if we have any query we can whatsapp her & if anything urgent only then only come. It was worthy for us to visit Motherhood Sarjapur from Whitefield only for Dr.Archana Pathak.She is a very professional, experienced, helpful and positive gynaecologist and I would definitely recommend her. Not only during the consultation phase but post delivery and even now she always responds on WhatsApp for any medical queries.Thank you Dr.Archana Pathak for making our pregnancy journey easy and happy \ud83d\ude0aAnd thank you Motherhood Sarjapur for the great facilities and staff. Would definitely recommend Motherhood Sarjapur to others.",

She was very detailed and prompt in giving response which added to our confidence. There were few offsets like too many reminders on taking cloud Devine package and later suggesting to go for C Section much before the expected due date, reason given that pelvis was small. A week after water broke and we got admitted. She was kind to visit late night. However emphasis was in Charge Section again for a different reason this time which is dilation is slow. It was very evident that she wants C Section However lack of consulting to us on why and what would be watchpoints in both normal delivery vs c section. It confused us a lot as we didn't know which way to go. \n\nFrom this point to till the delivery was full of anexiety, dillema and full of pain. I strongly feel there was lack of intention to inform the patient about the choices and help make the right decision. Lack of empathy and availablity at crucial moment. \n\nI thank her for the consulting during the course and wish to have switched to someone else for the delivery. ",

Her ability to smoothly transition and provide continuous care was a testament to her dedication. Moreover, Dr. Pathak played a crucial role in making the entire birthing process understandable by patiently explaining each step. Her clear communication not only eased any anxieties but also empowered us with knowledge. Setting clear expectations, she ensured a sense of confidence and trust, turning what could have been a challenging situation into a positive and well-informed journey.",

One of the nurse was very considerate since I was suffering from pain in the night and she was continuously monitoring and handling baby for the entire night.\n\nOne thing that can be improved is waiting time for scans which is generally around 1-2 hours after taking appointment.Rest over all hospital staff, facilities and doctor is very supportive",

Even though there was dengue attack during 34th week of pregnancy,  she ensured that we don't go into panic mode and her advice helped us to recover without any complications.Thank you for being with us during this memorable journey and helping us to sail through this phase with a smile !!!Regards,Nagesh and Anusha",

However, there was a double loop of cord found around the nack of baby in final scan.\nAlso she had reverted for our queries on WhatsApp whenever we asked for any doubt.\nShe was constantly checking and taking follow ups post delivery as well.\nBased on our experience, we can strongly recommend her for normal delivery.

We are associated with Doctor Archana from the time of our first pregnancy, 5 years ago and we are so happy with the service she provides to her patients that, we have referred her to many of our friends and family. Doctor is very good in managing the queries of her patients. My personal experience till now is, none of my queries over WhatsApp to Doctor were unanswered. It gives a sigh of relief for every anxious mom-to-be when her doctor responds on time and clarifies the doubts!! One of our family members had to go through emergency c section and Dr Archana Pathak managed it so well by responding to the emergency situation, guiding us without panicking and we are really grateful for her care, expertise, diagnosis and treatment.",

For consultancy, I visited Addon Labs and scans which was very convenient for me and saved lot of time. For delivery she preferred Motherhood hospital and she was present full day and also suggested duty doctors and nurses to take care of my immediate request. I will strongly recommend Dr. Archana for easy and wonderful pregnancy journey. Thank you mam for being helpful to me.",

We were pretty impressed by her in just first visit the way she explained things and answered naive questions with patience and calmness.The best part for me was when my wife was in labour she pinged her at 5 a.m. in the morning because she didn't know if the pain she was in is actually labour.She responded immediately and spoke to her.She suggested to get admitted to hospital and we were then blessed with a beautiful baby boy.For us she was a messenger of God and i don't think I will ever be at to thank her enough.",

As delivery date neared, Dr Pathak encouraged normal delivery, stating reasons why i should go for it. I went into labor 3 weeks early, middle of the night. Doctor reached the hospital minutes after receiving our call! The delivery itself was handled very smoothly - despite the ungodly hour, Dr. Pathak was all smiles, super efficient and very empathetic through the process.  Have also been seeking post natal care suggestions from her. She always seems to know the right answers, but the wonderful part is, never sounds over bearing! Definitely recommended!",

She never asks for any unnecessary tests or scan, only those tests and scan which is required.\nShe is very kind, and very soft spoken person which is the best quality of her.\n\nWe visited Dr Archana for my wife's first pregnancy, and only because her everything went so smooth, that we didn't even realise when all 9 months passed and we got our baby with normal delivery. She really look forward for normal delivery, even if mother was asking for c-section, she went for normal, and gave us our boy healthy.\nEven after delivery she does multiple followups with her patient, which is really very rare in Bangalore city.\nYou can even call/message her anytime, and she will always reply all your queries, what else a person looks in a doctor, \nShe is really a true doctor, a true Human. \n\n",

She provides her personal Number and will provide guidance if we call her anytime for any problem during pregnancy period. Our first baby but unfortunate that as per customs we went to our native for delivery. But for 8 and half months we were under her guidance and it was awesome treatment. She prefer to control anything via natural methods like in Food habitat, Exercises and so on. She avoids giving unwanted medicines to the conceived women as she cares about the health of both Baby and Mother. She is not money minded rather she is conscious on the health of the patient. Also she advise not to take unwanted scans and waste the money which is very difficult to find doctor like her in this money minded world. We can only find only few doctors and she is one among them",

She was very helpful, accomodative, always available on phone and whatsapp to answer any queries i have.  She took care of my pregnancy with great commitment and helped me to deliver normally even though i opted for c-section, for which i will always be thankful to her. I recommend Dr Arachana to all who really want to have normal delivery, because i have never heard any body saying lets go for normal delivery when we say or opt for c-section. Doctor with full confidence said she can delivery normally and just have faith in yourself, which is really great about her. Thank you very much Dr. Archana !!!",

In spite of the fact that we started our consultation in the final trimester, she was open to all our suggestions and cleared our doubts in the best way she could.  My previous experience with anesthesia was terrible, so I requested general anesthesia, but here, I really appreciate the way the doctor took spinal anesthesia like a 10 year old receiving an injection. During my first two surgeries in Kerala, I suffered much pain for over ten days following the operation and thankfully that was not the case here.  I remember the words of the nurses, who took care of my baby on the very first day by saying \" today you take a break mam, we'll take care of everything\". ",

I was scared to have a C-section, and always preferred to have a normal delivery. She always encouraged me that i can have normal delivery, and it was because of her confidance that we had smooth normal delivery in my 38th week of pregnancy with a healthy child. I would highly recommend any pregnant lady to consult her, if you wish to go for normal delivery and want to be guided in every month of your pregnancy. She is gem of a person to talk to.

It was a great experience and an absolute smooth journey towards parenthood.\n\nRight from day one she had explained me the procedure and asked me to be patient as it might take some time. After continuous followup and monitoring I was able to conceive in 5 months. Through-out the  pregnancy she was very supportive and explained me each time what I would experience during each weeks and trimester. Since I had favourable condition for a normal delivery, she ensured me if things go smoothly I could end up having a normal delivery only. Finally on the day of delivery, we were blessed with a beautiful daughter through normal delivery. Thanks to Dr. Archana for all her support through out our journey.",

Things and situation might not be same for everyone but we would strongly recommend Dr Archana Pathak for anyone, who is planning for a normal delivery.We went o Add-on scan and labs for all consultation, tests and scans. Service provided over there was very good.Even things at Motherhood Hospital was very systematic. They took very good care of us.

She took care of me during antenatal care and the birth of my baby. She respected my birth choices for normal birth and did everything possible to accomplish it. In my case, I was getting flustered in the end and asked for a cesarean but Dr. Archana assured me of normal birth. During the entire time, I felt safe and supported.

By god's grace and Dr's encouragement we conceived the very next month without any treatment.  she just prescribed iron and calcium supplements during pregnancy and no unnecessary scans and tests. Finally as she assured I was able to deliver a baby boy normally with her support and efforts. She is a good listener and explains every single point clearly and clarifies all concerns. She is approachable and responds to our queries over call/ text. many thanks to Dr.archana Pathak and team. I would like to thank Nursing staff who were kind and helpful.",

She explained me the process and also told me I need to be brave enough for normal delivery. On the day of delivery after 3 hours of labour I delivered a baby boy. There were some post delivery complications which were handled by madam and team and helped me recover fast.\nThank you so much madam for everything. During COVID time we feel it is a blessing to deliver normally without any issues. Many thanks again Doctor Archana Pathak and Team. I would definitely recommend madam for pregnancy consultation and delivery.\n",

I felt she was there for me throughout my journey at each step. She did my c section and delivered my baby without any complications.

She has been highly supportive throughout my entire journey of pregnancy. From day one till baby birth she guided me and took care of me like a mother. She is very approachable, explains everything in details and is always available over call and whatsapp. Delivery during COVID 19 in itself is a big challenge, but Doctor Archana easily performed the delivery as if there was no challenge at all. Even during this COVID pandemic she was always available and supportive. She is truly a gem of a person. All I can wish is \\\"GOD BLESS YOU DOCTOR\\",

When we had a confirmation, we struck an ocean of joy. Then the feeling slowly started sinking as we had to discover someone who could guide us through this journey to next level. This is where we were lucky to find Dr. Archana Pathak.\nI would have never imagined that I could have such a rare find. You can judge a doctor by the experience and degree they hold, but along side the most important quality which is very rare is empathy and kindness. Dr. Archana has all of these. She was very helpful, available and descriptive. She guided us really well throughout our journey towards parenthood. I can never thank her enough. \nThank you ma'am! ",

She would answer to the silliest question that you have with great patience. She doesn't suggest too many medicines, follow ups and procedures to be taken unnecessarily and never makes you get panic. She gives maximum importance on diet. Always suggests you to be active and carry on with your regular work routine until delivery. She was available in watsapp for any query to be answered pre and post pregnancy.\n\nWould recommend Dr Archana Pathak.",

She responds to all the naive questions you have.\n4- She genuinely tries for normal delivery if possible. In our case, after 8 yrs of gap,  she mentored us well for normal delivery\n5- She is truly experienced. On the day of delivery, there were quite a few panic moments. She carefully monitored all the critical parameters like baby\u2019s heart beat and took the right decision at right time to manage the risks yet do the best procedure. In our case, it was a normal delivery after 6 hrs of labour. \n\nWe feel lucky to have her as our doctor and we definitely recommends her to everyone in our network. ",

During the 9th month scan she noticed that the blood flow is restricted to one of the foetus and she immediately took a call to go for a c-section ensuring safe delivery. On the whole we are very happy with her and recommend her",

There is a certain level of warmth and friendliness in her persona which is where she has been really amazing. The treatment has been very satisfying and by the end of the delivery period we have been blessed with our wonder boy! Dr. Archana is an excellent listener amd very good at pacifying people which eased things for us everytime we met her. She is a true asset to any hospital she is working with and a superb doctor in every way possible. Highly recommended!",

She was always confident, motivating and made us feel at ease throughout. She was available for help even during off-hours at times of need. \n\nThe Doctor is patient and efficient. She will also make sure that we spent only on things which are absolutely necessary. I would certainly recommend this Doctor. ",

I did have a problem with my cervix in the later stages but she handled it with ease and its based on her suggestion that we tried to induce pain and deliver the baby 10 days before the actual due and it turned out to be the right decision as the baby was in the right weight range . She also helped me cope up with my labor pains and deliver the baby naturally. I would strongly recommend her not only for the above reasons but also for being straight forward with me on certain issues that matter to us as patients.",

I met her co-incidently for my first check up and later found that she is one of the best gynaecologist. And then on my journey begined. I was very nervous as it was my first delivery and also I was not at all prepared for it. However, she made sure to boost my confidence on each and every visit. There was not even a single moment when she suggested any unnecessary scannings or treatments. She also made sure to be available anytime i had a question or doubt. She kept on encouraging me for a normal delivery in the period, however I decided for a c-section after being in labour for sometime. Overall I loved the treatment, the services, the staff, the aftercare I got, everything was just perfect. Thank you so much Dr. Archana for all the support. Please do not hesitate if you are thinking of getting your maternity experience here.",

I was consulting another doctor *** ********** **** ** *********** *********** *** my condition worsen a lot.\nMy sister suggested me to meet Dr. Archana Pathak. She immediately stop all those medications.\nTo cut the long story short from painful and heavy periods to labor and then delivery, she treated and cared of me like her family. Always accessible and given clear and valuable suggestions. Dr Pathak was very patient in listening to us and clearing our doubts and calming us down.\n\nWithout her we couldn\u2019t have imagined a smooth and Normal delivery.\nI would highly recommend Dr. Pathak for any gynaecology and obstetrician related issues.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Archana ma\u2019am",

We searched on various platforms like Practo, Google & read multiple reviews of many doctors. We reached to Dr Archana pathak with a doubt in our minds whether those reviews were geniune or not. But after first consultation with doctor, all those doubts were vanished and  me & my wife both were very happy and relaxed.Throughout the consultation, Doctor was very friendly and always motivated us for normal delivery. *** ***** ********** *** *********** ***** ** **** ******* She was always available on whatsapp and call in case of any situation or doubt. Finally my wife delivered a baby girl in her 38week which was a normal delivery. We are very grateful to Dr Archana Pathak for making this 9 months journey more memorable & smooth for us.",

Once you visit Archana Mam you wont feel like seeing any other doctor she has that warmth. She will explain you about every single thing from very basic. You can ask all your random question and they will be entertained . Best thing is she gives time to her patients. If you have any doubt related to your pregnancy you can watsapp her any time and within minutes you will get her reply. I personally used to like the way she used to expalin thing giving her examples. The day we were expecting she was in contious touch with the on duty doctor and came to hospital at midnight for delivery. We are really happy that we took the decision to see Dr Archana Pathak, and can suggest other also to consult her based on our awesome experince. And yes the hospital facilities and staff was also very cooperative. Nurses were the to assit 24/7  with frequent on duty doctor visit.",

She was a gurdian angel and was always  a message away incase of any issues.\nI am very grateful to her for guiding me to this new chapter of my life and bringing in my bundle of joy to my life.\nMotherhood hospital also provided a very comforting birthing experience. My delivery was during the lockdown of the Second wave of covid-19. Only me and my husband were allowed in the hospital. The hospital helped us in every way as we had no other family members for any support.\nSpecial thanks to all the other doctors, lactation consultant, Physiotherapist, Pediatrician, the nurses and other help staff for making my journey to motherhood comforting and easy.",

I was suffering from irregular menstruation since childhood and achieving motherhood looked impossible to me. \nBut contrary to my imagination, the situation was different ,I got pregnant immediately after I started my treatment with Dr. Archana Pathak .\nAnd to my satisfaction, my pregnancy was extremely smooth  where she guided me from the beginning . Though I tried to have a normal delivery but ended up with scissor. All throughout I could see my doc encouraging me for a normal delivery . She waited during last critical hours to take the final call. At the end everything went well.\n\nPost delivery I had a situation of breast engorgement and again thanks to Dr. Archana Pathak that she saved me from this menace . Mine was a bit critical with high temperature ,swelling and pain. I had completely lost hope and thought that I will be under scissors soon. But all thanks to her , the condition improved with her guidance and support. \nI remember a situation when I was in extreme pain and she was off that day from hospital, it being her birthday . And to my wonders as soon as she got to know I was there she obliged us with her presence . A rare piece of act of humanity . Heard doctors are life saviors but met one actually . Many thanks to Dr Archana Pathak . ",

We met Dr. Archana Pathak who assured us that everything will be smooth.... She's an angel, she's down to earth and very friendly.. I had few drugs allergies to which she firmly told that she will be with me while I give a try to some drug which I feared that I might be allergic to...she made me so comfortable that I did try few drugs and found that I wasn't allergic to them. Especially the gastric medication what they prescribe during pregnancy. My 9 month transit was smooth. I delivered a healthy baby girl...the doctors and nurses staff at motherhood no doubt are awesome but the management isn't great too much confusion amongst themselves. Insurance team was not worth.  Manjula madam helped us when the issue was escalated.\nRooms were not great as there is some ventilation problem but we were given different room post our request. \nOverall because of the doctors and nurses I was super happy. \nThanks a ton to Dr Archana Pathak\nSarika Jagtap Chawla\n",

It was a very uncomfortable visit for my daughter who kept saying that she didn't care about having kids right now. She cared about not having regular periods and how that might effect her Type 1 Diabetes. She even felt that my daughter didn't know how to take care of her diabetes and by daughter has had it sine 7 years! Ever single point she made was about kids and how my daughter needs to remember about kids. We were so irritated that the second we left the room, we booked an appointment with another gynecologist. The second one we had was great! She was very supportive of my daughter and encouraged her to focus more on her diabetes then worry about her periods since it isn't an issue she should worry about at all. ",

I strongly recommend her for all the gynaec related problems.",

Most importantly she helped us in saving lot of money by avoiding unnecessary scans and tests. \nAt delivery time she helped us in negotiating with Apollo hospitals for delivery package.

The scans and check-ups were always a matter of concern for me but it lasted only till the time I spoke to her.  Her care and clear diagnosis helped  me a lot to stay calm and composed till my delivery date and was in ecstasy when she gave my bundle of joy to me with a normal delivery process.

She was always there to clarify our queries on mobile in times of any concerns from us. She suggested us to go for normal delivery but due to some complications, our baby had to be delivered through C-section. She assured us that all will be taken care and that all will be good and nothing to be worried about. She encouraged us a lot to be optimistic and our journey throughout the pregnancy and delivery was smooth and satisfying, all thanks to Dr. Archana. She visited us multiple times to ensure that everything was alright during our hospital stay for delivery. And YES! we would blindly recommend Dr. Archana Pathak to any of our friends or relatives to start a happy parenting life just like us \ud83d\ude0a.",

Doctor always guided us in the right path and gave lot of confidence and advice on how to handle myself during the metarnity period. Also doctor always encouges to prepare yourself for the normal delivery which is highly appreciated. Doctor is very very approachable anytime and ready to listen to our silly talks patiently. The experience is really different when compared to other doctors we met for other things. She always had lot of time for the patient and her family. We are very very greatful to her for being with us and completing delivery procedure normally.. Myself and my baby are doing great after delivery.",

She is really friendly and co-operated with us till the day of discharge. We are really thankful and cherish every little moment that we've spent under her supervision.\n\nThank you,\n\nTanu Verma.  \n\n ",

Me and my husband really appreciate her hard work and persistence . I had a normal delivery for which she always encouraged.\nWith minimal medicines, I used to feel like just another day throughout my pregnancy. She guided me on my diet plan and what should be my daily routine and I am really thankful to her.\nJust like any normal person, Even I checked google review of Archana Ma\u2019am and the time invested is invaluable So, I would highly recommend everyone to get there consultation done with Dr. Archana Pathak. \n\nDr. Archana Ma\u2019am , We appreciate your efforts in giving us the bundle of Joy :)\nThank You!",
