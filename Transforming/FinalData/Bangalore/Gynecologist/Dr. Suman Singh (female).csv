"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"My husband and I had first visited doctor Suman in November 2019 when our home pregnancy test result was positive. We had searched for the best gynaecologist around and her name surfaced online with the highest rating and best reviews. Right from the first visit, we were very comfortable with doctor and although I had unfortunately suffered a sudden miscarriage, doctor comforted us explaining how somethings happen naturally and sometimes for our best. After my miscarriage, I did not get my periods naturally for 5 months inspite of all my reports being normal and it worried me big time. But doctor very calmly explained to me that there is nothing to worry and asked me to lose atleast 10 percent of my body weight. She said just try to lose 10 percent of your current weight and you will get your periods. That was exactly what happened when I lost weight as suggested and I could conceive naturally after 3 months. My pregnancy was when covid was at its peak, but it was really nice of doctor Suman to have online consultations with me and I had visited her at the clinic only on my 12th week after I conceived. My pregnancy journey was very smooth thanks to her care and she asked me to register at Rainbow hospital due to which I could avail benefits of attending online classes on Labour pain and delivery, epidural, Breastfeeding and such other topics which were very helpful. In my 32nd week, we realised that my AFI was at border around 10.6 units and having suffered a miscarriage once I was worried. It was very nice of dr. Suman to calm me down saying everything is fine and it instilled a lot of confidence in me. She had asked me to walk as much as possible for normal delivery. My due date was 22nd March,2021 but on 14th March early morning I experienced water leak and was rushed to Rainbow hospital. I was induced around 7.30am and Dr. Suman had spoken to me on call to explain me the procedure and also visited me in my room sometime later. She comforted me saying that my labour is proceeding very well, asked me to take deep breaths and be positive. My delivery although vaccum assisted was very smooth as doctor explained me when and how to push very nicely.She was very supportive and encouraging throughout and helped us deliver healthy baby boy and she also joked saying dekho baby ka weight acha hai all thanks to the aloo bhujia that you ate during pregnancy :) She even played my favourite Om Namah Shivaay song for me and my baby Rudransh in the labour room after delivery :). Although doctor is very strict and professional, she has a very caring and warm side to her, always patiently listening and answering all my questions. I have already recommended her to all my friends and cousins in Bangalore. Thank you Doctor Suman for making my journey to motherhood such a pleasant experience and wishing you happiness and roaring success always :)

Dr. Suman Singh is Very good doctor. She provides good treatment which is useful for us & supports the patient very well. We consulted other doctors in Bangalore ( no patience and time to clearly listen what our problem is) and we were not guided properly, loss of time and lost hope on pregnancy. Finally, we came to know about Dr.Suman Singh from one of my friend and we consulted her. She listens very carefully and with lots of patience and guides us very correctly 💯 what to do next. Just within two months I got conceived with her treatment( no other words to express my love and joy and happiness except thanking her☺️).Her treatment and guidance is very good and useful. Whichever scans, blood tests she asks us to do, are correct and perfect(without any loss of time and hope). Her treatment is perfect, good,excellent and if we can find any new words for appreciating her also can be added. Will be very much thank full to her life long. She supported very well throughout my pregnancy. She is the saviour. In our view whatever she tells is correct and we can trust mam blindly without any second thought. My delivery was done by suman Singh mam at rainbow children's hospital. I suggest every couple to consult her who are planning for pregnancy to get good treatment. She is very unique from other doctors.Thanks a lot mam. Thank you so much. Finally one word Dr Suman Singh is excellent 👌😍.",2024-04-03 05:09:40,False,True,Verified Patient,So happy and grateful that we could make a positive change in your life.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnant Women Counseling,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Visited for first pregnancy between Sep 2019-Apr 2020:Pros-‌she is very methodical and very well organized;‌she works based on standard protocol;‌ She infact works round the clock;‌She has her huge experience behind her to back her up;‌Everything is planned upfront, at least a week ahead;‌ You need to read the notice board well, if you are visiting her at Manasi clinic, BTM layout;‌She has handled our case to perfection from monthly assesments and with delivery as well;‌She is well updated with latest procedures from pregnancy perspective;She will take medical decision based on the condition of the patient and nothing is predetermined. We had a baby girl at Rainbow. Thanks to mam :) Cons for the Patient - :) (None for the doc) ‌Since she is very systematic, you also need to be very systematic with your appointments n conveying the information back, unless its is an emergency case; Else you are not spared :)‌ You can't just drop in and expect to visit her unless it's a real emergency;‌ If you are not communicating  appropriately with timely tests n check ups, it wouldn't be a smooth discussion;‌ Please go through the notice board, understand how she charges her visits and if you are fine with it, proceed further; Else you will only crib later as to why are you being charged for this or that‌ Unless you are not ready work with her methodically, systematically, in an organized manner for your own baby, it will be a uphill task.‌ Overall,I will definitely recommend her.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnant Women Counseling,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Based on my experience with Dr Suman Singh, * *** ****** **** *** ** *** **** ************. 
I will refer all my friends to her practice.
Explaining three major reasons, why I am saying her best:
1.	Passion 
2.	Perfection 
3.	Responsible

Passion :  The kind of passion she has for her profession, I have never seen in any doctor in my life. I have mate several doctors in my life.
My pregnancy case was complicated and stormy, but the way Dr. Suman Singh handled all the phases, I must say, without her it would have been not possible to deliver a baby.

Perfection:  When it comes to perfection, she knows what exact treatment she is going to do for patient and if she suggests some tests, she knows exactly why she is asking you to do that and she will explain you also in detail.

Responsible: My delivery was planned at 9:30 AM, but due to some emergence I went hospital very early morning and when the duty Dr checked and explained my condition to Dr. Suman Singh, she immediately asked her to prepare me for the OT.
 I would like to appreciate her that she was there in OT within 10 Mins. And its not the easy thing for any person in that much early morning but She always takes the responsibility and ownership of her patient.

There are many other reasons, why I strongly recommend her like - Vast Experience, Friendliness, availability, Confidence and many more.
I would like to appreciate, and thanks Dr Suman Singh for the treatment, just because of her we got the most precious gift of our life.

even assured me that it is nothing like i had presumed. She will ask for minimum number of tests . However if you urge for tests( that may not be required) for your mental satisfaction she will even listen to that and give her time as well.
She is also reachable on her mobile number and she is very quick to respond to the messages.


A note to anyone having second thoughts, just don't pay any attention to the negative reviews here and just trust the doctor and her expertise.

We have prescribed antibiotics after the culture tests and not randomly, each time if the infection is different then you have to look at your own hygiene and possible source of infection from the spouse especially if they are diabetic.
We have also examined her to rule out vaginal infections. I told her in the last visit that if culture is negative and if she is still having symptoms, she must see urologist to rule out stricture urethra and also evaluate for tuberculosis. 
The evaluation for recurrent urine infections is done only after a person has repeat infections despite appropriate treatment.You are not starting from scratch again, it is the logical next step.

Considering my 1st pregnancy was unpleasant with multiple problems with another doctor.  I was sure that Dr. Suman Singh can help me this time as I had visited her for abnormal bleeding which was treated in just 15 days. My treatment was too good during pregnancy and I delivered a healthy baby of 3.5 kgs. According to my reports,there was a risk of low weight baby,but doc made sure that I deliver a healthy baby with lots of tips . And about the delivery, though my delivery was planned,  I went into labor 2 hrs before and mam was there immediately for delivery.
I had to go for c-section only due to previous pregnancy complications and mam knew that.

We visited clinics, hospital and consulted many doctors but to be honest, it was not satisfying as its more of scary experience. We were very sceptical on the first visit with Dr Suman, but believe me, she is strict and talks straight without sugar coating, but you rarely find a caring, trustworthy and knowledgeable doctor like her. Initially she does few tests. We were wondering why the doctor prescribed test, and rather than speaking to us more, she was on another call. Later we found that there was an emergency baby delivery and she was instructing other doctors for treatment. From that point, we never questioned her work ethics. Just follow her prescription/suggestion and you will never have to worry on anything.We were having regular checkups and the day came where our baby was ready to meet us. Suman asked us to go for Normal delivery and she was confident that we can go with Normal delivery. But since my wife was little worried of few things, we went for C section and Suman got us delivered with wonderful girl baby now.We cannot thank her much for this beautiful journey and I would recommend her for anyone as there are 100 reasons to do so.",2020-06-01 05:49:24,False,True,Anusha,"You were such a pleasant patient to treat.

My receptionist reiterated this again before you'll left.Yet you decided to flout the instructions again and came to the clinic. Whose fault is that?? Why do you think its OK for you to disregard the guidlines. We have to contain crowding in the clinic and allowing attenders inside for non emergencies is not acceptable as talking also spreads the virus especially since many of you are not wearing your masks correctly.Let me tell you also that sitting for more than 12 hours per day in a N95 mask and face shield without AC or FAN is extremely suffocating....most of us find it difficult to breathe / talk for extended periods .......but am sure you don't give a damn about our life or safety.However I have to factor in many things, including sterility of my chamber,safety of the pregnant women and my staff,given that ours is a small closed space. Your daughter is a smart educated girl ,didn't need you to spell out irregular periods for her.I had another teenager just like this yesterday and they followed my instructions...both mother and daughter were very happy with the follow up discussion on the phone.So,don't blame others when you are at fault.As for the fees,please do the math properly...after deducting taxes and consumables,I get only 300-500 which is what a plumber or an electrician charges!!.....and I haven't even  factored in the huge subscription costs of the expensive software that we use for the clinic management and the digital papers ...... honestly its too less for a senior doctor like me who is almost 50 years old with a vast experience.  Our charges are transparent and displayed on our notice board.If I was late ,that's because i had a patient from UK online who was desperate for help as they have no access to doctors despite emergencies...and just for the record ...am not rude ...am very friendly but a strictly no nonsense doctor.",2020-05-14T13:56:46+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

My First visit was in Feb'2019 when I had a PCOS,Fibroids,low vitamins(b12,D3 & CA). Dr thoroughly seen all my reports and suggested for 3months course for vitamin and PCOS correction along with diet chart, which helped me to reduce 2kgs(being a hypothyroid patient).
Then I was asked for follicular scan in Jun followed by upt test. But unfortunately it was unsuccessful for me.
Then in July'19, I didn't get cycle and visited doc again with my tsh report. She suggested for medicine for cycle(which was safe with concieve and I was not aware) and ultrasound. Again in 15thAug'19 I rushed to her with my upt +ve and was bit worried that medicine for cycle may hamper my baby. But believe me she consoled me that the medicine for cycle is safe with concieve and I was asked continued the same tablet for my first trimester. Her clear instructions and her expertise only helped me concieve and save my baby. Am really grateful to almighty that we are under supervision of a great doc.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Complicated Pregnancy Treatment,Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"We were pregnant for the first time and we were quiet anxious and overwhelmed by the information we had to process. One of the most difficult step in this process was to decide who our gynaecologist was going to be. We consulted a couple of gynaecologists, however, we felt that our needs were not addressed. Later we came across Dr. Suman Singh, after the first consultation we knew we had met our doctor, it was peak of COVID, and she followed the COVID protocol to the T. We had many questions, which she addressed in a manner in which we could understand.

After every consultation we felt that we were in the safe hands and our confidence only grew thereafter. We were particularly impressed by her attention to the detail and her meticulous planning.

She is someone who needs her things in order, be it preparation for the delivery at the labor room or the medical reports when you go to her during consultation, she needs it in an order, no compromise on that, this makes sure we have double checked our reports as well. This quality of hers is what we liked the most because we knew she would not leave anything for chance.

Armed with her advice when we walked to the hospital on the DDay we felt well prepared, there came a point where she was giving instructions to the duty doctor at 3am and again she was talking to us at 8am in the morning. In the labor room when she was around, one understood that she was in-charge. Her presence of mind and timely decision making is something that we were impressed by. we have fond admiration for her for she knows what her patient needs and how to go about achieving it.

We had a natural child birth and we thank Dr. Suman Singh for all the care and advice she gave us.

First thing told to me on the online video consultation was, you have 10mins to discuss. Doctor was neither friendly nor nade good effort to exain my concern. Even if its a video consultation we are paying a good 850rs so no justice is done when you cut off a patient trying yo get a good explanation or understanfing about her confusion saying other patients are waiting, but we all are paying.

Secondly be precise in your questions and don't waste our time with unnecessary stories about where you are, where your husband is, where you are working, and where you want to travel.
You had a concern about g e r d in pregnancy for which I gave you detailed explanation, do's and don'ts and also the relevant treatment.
Then you asked me my opinion whether you could travel out of the country , but gave me two ambiguous scan reports contradicting each other.Hence I told you that you could go with the opinion of your consulting doctor as your reports were not conclusive. However you insisted that I give an opinion which was not possible.
Lastly you mentioned that you were taking an anxiety medicine and wanted to know if it was okay for you in pregnancy. You have not shared the prescription for me to know the correct name/molecule and I asked you to speak to your psychiatrist regarding the same as medications have to be continued after the evaluating the pros and cons completely.
I started the consultation at 8: 14 pm and ended at 8:34 p.m., which means I gave you 10 extra minutes over and above the allotted time to you.
In the middle of a busy clinic when the other patients are being made to wait I think it is rather rude on your part to keep dragging the consultation especially when I cannot give an opinion due to insufficient data .
Also the poor network that Practo provides makes the consultation extremely difficult and laborious with multiple call backs often which is frustrating for both. 
Mind you we are paid only 400 odd rupees for the consultation on Practo which is too less for the amount of time that we have given you.
We too feel short changed by both Practo  who charges exorbitantly for pathetic service and from patients who have unrealistic expectations from an online consultation .

However I was surprised when yesterday you messaged me saying Hi ! I still haven't got my period....... And sent me a picture of your pregnancy test which was positive,expecting a urgent consultation from me despite giving a negative feedback!!! Isn't it shady on your part?!!

Surprised by your double standards and diabolical attitude, I messaged you back saying that there was a discussion involved hence I had wanted to do a proper consultation for the same.
We are doctors and we understand what our responsibilities are very well at the same time we are not walk overs who will accept being exploited and abused by UN professional patients like yourself who are looking for free consultations and are willing to put us down when you can't have your way.

It appears to me that as an after thought you have decided to cry foul  probably at the behest of your husband .

She tried to call me once and due to Practo app issue I was not audible to her. After that she didn’t try to call me again and my queries where simple which should have been clarified over msgs. Very unfriendly behaviour. I am not sure about in clinic visit but would not recommend online consultation with her. Unhappy with Practo and doctor experience. ,2022-11-14 13:45:35,True,False,Verified Patient,"First of all you are a very confused person yourself who keeps changing her requirements for period management repeatedly. After our consultation(have closed it after one hour not in 7 minutes!!) and explaining how to take the medicines to manage your periods, then you send me multiple messages during the follow up with each message more confusing than the next. You don't even have the courtesy to write the dates properly, you are using an American system and interchanging the day and the month adding to the confusion as your message is incomplete and with every message you are wanting to use a different permutation of the medicine prescribed as per your whims and fancies. I had to spend so much additional time trying to understand your messages again and again ,finally I got fed up and I tried to call you but you were not connected on the app because of which I could not get through to you .Nonetheless I redid my prescription to suit your new requirements.

Instead of wasting your time and my time writing such a lengthy feedback it would have been much better if you had put more thought into your consultation in the first place and neatly written down your requirements when we had asked you to do so.If you were better organised the confusion and rework wouldnt have been necessary.

Writing multiple messages back to back during evening OPD hours will not help as I have only two hands to work with and the only condition on which I accept these online consultations on Practo is that I should be able to respond to them at a time that I am free ,after I have attended to my clinic patients.

If you do not have the patience to wait for a follow up response and expect an immediate response,let me inform you that it is not possible.We have been allotted 24 hrs to respond by Practo. 

You are quick to call us unfriendly(because of delay in follow up) but I just find your whole attitude towards me rather rude and ungrateful especially when I was running high temperature and still working beyond my capacity to attend to your umpteen changes in requests.

Most of you are not even aware of what you are entitled to in a Practo online consultation and unnecessarily keep ordering us to call you back which is also out of line.

Fed up with the unreasonable demands that people have on these online consultations I have reduced it drastically to spare me the headaches of these online consultations.

I am more than happy to consult patients on my WhatsApp as I find the connectivity excellent and I am immediately able to reach out to a patient if I have to explain to her the medicines or at least leave voice messages for her to hear at her convenience",2022-11-15T16:25:49+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

Nonetheless I had answered all the questions that you asked.Am actually surprised by this review.Sometimes when a patient looks uncomfortable ,we may put off further probing to a subsequent session to reduce the awkwardness.

Since the main concern that you presented with was lack of libido I took a complete history and then asked you to do a few blood tests including a thyroid test near your place Indiranagar itself and I also explained to you that I need to first ensure that you are otherwise healthy before looking into the psychological reasons for reduced libido.

Since you mentioned that you had painful intercourse almost as if something was blocking the way, I told you to also do a scan to rule out  PID/ endometriosis and other causes which are common for painful intercourse.I also asked you to come and see me in the clinic so that I could examine you properly and evaluate the reason for the difficulty in having intercourse and rule out vaginismus/vaginitis/rigid hymen etc.More so since you were still unmarried I  didn’t want you to be hurt or develop a phobia due to a painful experience hence thought to examine you before writing any medication.

Appears to me that you were looking for some stopgap treatment and not a detailed evaluation.

I have started my consultation on time and finished on time , not within 5 minutes as mentioned by you. The time stamp on my online chat and prescription clearly shows that I have given you full time. In fact I closed the consultation only after  20 minutes .",2021-09-02T20:57:29+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

My records show that I have closed the consultation after 20 minutes so obviously I have given you enough time.
After closing the consultation also the chat window is open for messages so if there was something else that you wanted to discuss nothing prevented you from messaging me again. It seems to me that you are more interested in fault finding than in really looking to improve your health.

Your behaviour is toxic, shocking and petty to say the least!You were my old patient and everything was fine till my receptionist told you that a consultation charge was to be paid since your last visit was on 4th and hence yesterday on 11 th it was due.I have already done a review of your other reports on whatsapp. Instead of dutifully paying and moving on with the consultation, your husband called my receptionist and started spewing venom for which later you apologised and accepted that I was nice to you and that you were not aware that according to medical guidelines we had to be quick with consultations to avoid spreading infections and risk to lives..Also many a times when we discuss we have quite a few points to cover and constant interruptions can interfere with the flow of thought.I always ask your history first and gather my points before discussing, moreover we always give you time to ask your doubts/clarification after my discussion because by then I would have covered most of the points and we are more systematic in our discussion.
We are humans first and feel very hurt when multiple false accusations are made , your husband was abusing and even threatening us yesterday.. we don't feel comfortable/safe talking to toxic, suspicious negative people because we don't know what all they'll accuse us of in the future.After all the accusations you still want me to look at the report and discuss?

Some patients try to hoodwink us by claiming it to be a free consult when it's not and so obviously get caught when the opd notes are shared. This patient was seen on 12th in Rainbow and despite being told to meet me directly with all the reports, decided to show me only scan on 12th and do a follow up on the phone on 15th for the blood reports; which I did without any charge as per rainbow policy.Since she was persistently anemic I had asked for a Hb electrophoresis to rule out thalassemia trait (medically required as thalassemics can't be given iron injections and also to rule out potential fetal problems). Now on 19th she again wanted me to do a free consultation which was out of place. Finally after sending me 9 msgs on my whatsapp she ordered me to give prescriptions on practo online consult which is registered under her husband's name,not her name... Hence I told them to stick to one portal for consultation as it's very time consuming and confusing to treat on 2 portals and maintaining records is difficult.Finally I got fed up with their attitude and cancelled their payment and refunded their money back to them. Anyday its more satisfying to see pleasant people rather than those who keep arguing unnecessarily. 

Babies don't get delivered by appointments!!! and we have no control on emergencies either. Sometimes patients come late and by the time they come I have to go to OT and then they get stuck. We have time and again requested patients to come 15 min early to the reception in order to finish weight and BP check so that they are on time for our consultations.I usually finish my opd before I go to the OT unless there is an imminent delivery or dire emergency which is understandable.",2020-05-20T15:38:28+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

Online Consultation started at 12.25pm and ended at 12.49 pm with the prescription after which you even thanked me since the previous doctor had given you an unnecessary long course of treatment!! Consultation was closed at 1 pm and automated msg sent to you if you had any queries for which you didn't reply!!. You had ample time to ask questions and clarify if you had any.

Now, let me inform you that your consultation time alloted is only for 10 minutes for online consultations. Despite exceeding that and further giving you the option to ask questions to clarify your doubts, instead of being proactive you chose to write a negative comment. Weird!!

Also comment is by Sanjay who is not even the patient!!!

There are emergencies in clinic  and hospital too when these delays are just plain annoying to say the least.Practo has an annoying system of continuous notifications, so if the next consultation get delayed(we have only 2 min to respond!!)we get continuous calls which mute the ongoing consultation.. and delays it even further!!you shd be sitting with us to understand our side of the problem too .

I have responded to all your queries , gone way beyond my expected consultation time of 10 minutes and have even patiently waited during the delay from your end in sending me the reports. During the follow up you wanted to know if a brand substitution could be done which was addressed and when that  did not suit you and you commented that you had some side effects I asked you to see me but you did not want to and instead wanted a different prescription for which also I obliged.

I honestly do not understand your  grudge against me as I have fulfilled my duties properly.

I had asked for a CBC and random blood sugar test and you haven't sent the reports yet.

You have sent some irrelevant reports which are not related to your condition or what I had asked for and so I told you clearly to do the required tests and share but you neglected. 

It is very easy to blame somebody else without understanding your own mistakes.
Also please be clear that the online consultation on Practo is for 10 minutes only and you are supposed to be ready with your details and reports uploaded before the consultation starts so that you  do not waste the doctor's time.
Be mindful that there are other patients waiting and their notification keeps coming to us as a reminder that we need to conclude ongoing consultation.

While paying for Practo you would have been aware that the follow up will be only through messages and we have 24 hours to respond to your follow up messages subject to our schedule. If you see properly I have not faultered in my consultation at all.",2022-10-19T09:27:59+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

You also thanked  me and said that you understood the problem correctly .I am actually shocked that you have written such a negative feedback am really lost for words.

As you are already aware and I am sure Practo also must have told you that your cashless facility is only towards the consultation charge and not towards the one time registration fee of Rs 100 which was what my receptionist asked you to pay .The practo app doesn't come free for us.We have to pay a huge subscription fee in order to facilitate the usage of their software for booking/billing/online consultation etc.This is as per Practo rules.You can always call them and verify.
My receptionist was only doing her duty and was not rude to you in any way. Infact so many patients have complimented her on her friendly behaviour.
A consultation fees of Rupees 700 valid for 6 days for a senior doctor with over 25 years of experience is very very low to be honest. 
Follow up has been done and reports were normal.One test is pending from your side after which the final discussion can be completed.Same was communicated to you during the followup.

As for the charges well what can I say Practo takes the money from you,so you can discuss this directly with them.
I see that Practo has blocked out their name from your feedback while trying to make it appear to be a complaint only about me....1/5/22...reviewed your details after procuring it from practo..you had a complaint of post coital bleeding for which you had already shared your thyroid,prolactin and USG reports and after seeing them i have clearly told you that they were normal.Have asked you to do two other tests and also visit a local gynecologist for an internal examination as bleeding after intercourse mandates this examination to rule out cervical causes of bleeding which cannot be determined on a phone consultation or ultrasound.The prescription was clearly written and the same is also seen by you.You haven't reverted with the reports.Do you know post coital bleeding can be a  symptom of cervical cancer!!how does one diagnose it without checking????Just because your knowledge of the subject is limited does not mean that we dont know our job!!!",2022-05-01T02:07:54+0000,Dr. Suman Singh

Have spoken to your mother, taken detailed history, examined her, bp etc.. Also saw all the reports that you had on your phone... It was a long list.. Anyways, Started discussing all her medical issues with her and told her that she needed to see a physician for her medical issues and her high BP. When I felt that she wasn't comprehending much, I broke the protocol and allowed you inside (we have not been allowing attenders since Covid-19) and again repeated the whole discussion about her medical issues and bp. Told you that alprax wasn't a good choice of medicine for her given that it's addictive. Also discussed hot flushes and post menopausal symptoms. Gave her the recommended gynec tests and gynec medications and told you to follow up on the phone as I didn't want her to come out and risk herself in this pandemic. What more do you need? So disrespectful and ungrateful. Finding faults with others and trolling senior people without any understanding seems to be the favourite pass time of some people. We have been specifically instructed not to spend too much time with each patient.. A pandemic is not the time to get chatting with patients. Most of us are putting ourselves and our families at risk for ungrateful patients like you. Look inside and ask yourself a few deep questions. Appreciate what you have and respect it.
