,,0,0,YES,"I would like to start by thanking Dr. Sahana Deshpande, who has been a strong support to me and my wife throughout the tenure of pregnancy. Dr. Sahana has  been a motherly figure to us who took care of my wife with best of her efforts and led us to a stress free and successful delivery of our baby. Dr. Sahana understood my wife's health conditions (Diabetic, past miscarriage) and always kept our hopes high and never allowed any stress to surround our thoughts. Her always positive attitude, patiently listening skills, and explaining each stage of pregnancy with calm and patient tone was a huge support to us. She was even generous to guide us and stayed responsive to our messages, whenever we felt any urgency. Not just Dr. Sahana helped us during pregnancy, but her presence at the time of labor was also a huge morale booster for me and my wife. Her presence was sufficient enough to keep us confident and maintain our composure during the stressful time of labor and delivery. Dr. Sahana is definitely highly recommended for anyone looking for a caring gynecologist and she will always be a huge part of our life hereafter.",2024-07-25 17:27:24,False,True,Prateek Patni,,,
,,0,0,YES,I didn’t know much about Dr Sahana Deshpande when I visited her for my pregnancy consultation in January but now I very highly recommend her. She is extremely experienced *** ************** I couldn’t get a better experience with elsewhere. Throughout the pregnancy she put confidence in me for a normal delivery and advised to prepare my body for the same. She never got in a panic mode and showed a lot of patience during my labour too. I have recently become a mother and I give all the credit to her for my well being during this journey.,2022-09-21 16:07:35,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
