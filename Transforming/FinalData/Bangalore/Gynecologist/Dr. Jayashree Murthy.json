Who can strike a conversation related to your health or anything under the sun. Due to this sometimes the wait can be a little longer. But she was very frank and confident with the treatment. I had a normal delivery the first time and was keen to have a normal one again. She assured me that she will go for normal. Towards the last trimester, I had high BP and complications on the delivery day. Inspite of this, she made  sure that I have a normal delivery. Although to some extent it could have turned out fatal. But she assured me throughout my delivery that nothing would happen and she will ensure everything goes well. Honestly, I felt my baby girl gave her a hard time.... When my baby was born, she told me that it\u2019s underweight but not to worry as she is very healthy and seems to be a smart and strong one. That was so kind of her. She made me very comfortable with those words.\nThank you doctor, for the kind words and assurance. ",

But on my delivery day don't know what happened to her though the conditions were normal and everything was fine, it's just that my dilation was taking time she started telling me for c section. I wanted to wait fo few more hours but one sentence she told me still hurts me \" At 7 I have to go to my clinic so please decide\". I trusted her so much but just because she was getting late for her clinic she did not want to wait for normal delivery and did c section. Guys it's very difficult to trust a doctor. I recommended her to all my friends to that level I trusted her. One of my friend had the same case as mine but her doctor waited for 14 hours after giving epidural and induced the labor again and finally delivered normally but my luck was not supportive probably that's y my doctor did not support me. She could have easily waited for few more hours. In.my case she waited only for 5 hours after epidural",

Who can strike a conversation related to your health or anything under the sun. Due to this sometimes the wait can be a little longer. But she was very frank and confident with the treatment. I had a normal delivery the first time and was keen to have a normal one again. She assured me that she will go for normal. Towards the last trimester, I had high BP and complications on the delivery day. Inspite of this, she made  sure that I have a normal delivery. Although to some extent it could have turned out fatal. But she assured me throughout my delivery that nothing would happen and she will ensure everything goes well. Honestly, I felt my baby girl gave her a hard time.... When my baby was born, she told me that it\u2019s underweight but not to worry as she is very healthy and seems to be a smart and strong one. That was so kind of her. She made me very comfortable with those words.\nThank you doctor, for the kind words and assurance. ",

But on my delivery day don't know what happened to her though the conditions were normal and everything was fine, it's just that my dilation was taking time she started telling me for c section. I wanted to wait fo few more hours but one sentence she told me still hurts me \" At 7 I have to go to my clinic so please decide\". I trusted her so much but just because she was getting late for her clinic she did not want to wait for normal delivery and did c section. Guys it's very difficult to trust a doctor. I recommended her to all my friends to that level I trusted her. One of my friend had the same case as mine but her doctor waited for 14 hours after giving epidural and induced the labor again and finally delivered normally but my luck was not supportive probably that's y my doctor did not support me. She could have easily waited for few more hours. In.my case she waited only for 5 hours after epidural",
