During consultation, it appears that Dr.Meenakshi Kamath was heavily pressurizing my mother to undergo hysterectomy, the surgical procedure.

My 81 year old father too was present there.

My mother, a chronic diabetic & with other ailments, a retired LIC of India Employee, having already seen the serious side-effects of hysterectomy in her colleague and others, firmly said NO to Dr.Meenakshi Kamath.

Later, the hospital executive went in and met Dr.Meenakshi Kamath and she wrote ₹2500 for the pessary insertion.

In all hospitals, the charge, even when separately charged and not made part of consultation, for pessary insertion, is ₹500 to ₹1000 max.

But here, consultation which was purely for pessary insertion, was already charged.

In addition, was this ₹2500/-
