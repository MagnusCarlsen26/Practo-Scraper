We researched online for many weeks in order to find the best fertility doctor in the area, and we found and choose Iswarya Fertility Clinic Marathalli and Dr.Shalini Maam based on the reviews and her experience. It was not an easy easy task, since we were looking for someone that we could trust. I am writing this review with the hope of helping others that are going thru this struggle. Going back to our story, we knew that she was the one when we had our first consultation. She took her time to explain different options to us. She is very knowledgeable and she has lots of experience, but best of all that she truly cares about her patients. I have never felt that I was just another patient for her. She made us confident about being successful on this journey. We always felt excited to go to appointments because we knew we were getting closer and closer. We followed her advises, listened her opinion and left everything on her hand. We trusted her very much because she made us believe! After almost 6 years with various of treatments, we are now expecting our first baby. I am currently 2 months pregnant, and I graduated from this clinic with tears.There are not enough words to express our gratitude to Dr.Shalini Maam, Dr.Supriya, Nurse-Mahalakshmi & Roopa, Receptionist-Swarna & Sahana and whole team .We will never forget, and always remember this journey. We are very happy that we made the best decision, and never gave up. Thank you Dr. Shalini Maam You are our Hero!",

We researched online for many weeks in order to find the best fertility doctor in the area, and we found and choose Iswarya Fertility Clinic Marathalli and Dr.Shalini Maam based on the reviews and her experience. It was not an easy easy task, since we were looking for someone that we could trust. I am writing this review with the hope of helping others that are going thru this struggle. Going back to our story, we knew that she was the one when we had our first consultation. She took her time to explain different options to us. She is very knowledgeable and she has lots of experience, but best of all that she truly cares about her patients. I have never felt that I was just another patient for her. She made us confident about being successful on this journey. We always felt excited to go to appointments because we knew we were getting closer and closer. We followed her advises, listened her opinion and left everything on her hand. We trusted her very much because she made us believe! After almost 6 years with various of treatments, we are now expecting our first baby. I am currently 2 months pregnant, and I graduated from this clinic with tears.There are not enough words to express our gratitude to Dr.Shalini Maam, Dr.Supriya, Nurse-Mahalakshmi & Roopa, Receptionist-Swarna & Sahana and whole team .We will never forget, and always remember this journey. We are very happy that we made the best decision, and never gave up. Thank you Dr. Shalini Maam You are our Hero!",
