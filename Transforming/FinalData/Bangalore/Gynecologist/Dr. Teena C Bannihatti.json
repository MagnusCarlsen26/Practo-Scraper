I was planning for pregnancy from past 2 years but I wasn't and  after taking treatment from Teena , within 4 months I got conceived.\nIt's apparent that Dr.Teena really care about patients. The way she handles patient is very much impressive. She prefers C-Section surgery when it is really required only. I never found commerc nature in her. I was in impression that I can't go for normal delivery as I am very lean and not having that much strength so got very scared about normal delivery and requested for C-section , Even though I asked for C-section delivery she didn't go for it and I got normal delivery and blessed with baby girl.\nNowadays doctors don't have time to give proper treatment to patients because of their busy schedules but Dr.Teena will give sufficient time to each patient.\n*** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** I can't thank you enough for the excellent care she has provided.  Thank you so much for the great treatment.",

I always kept Dr Teena informed about anything which I felt was odd. Her responsiveness helped me keep myself calm/positive and also avoided unnecessary trips to the clinic for every small question.",

Since my wife was very weak, we were in dilemma whether to continue the pregnancy.\nUpon advise by our colleague, we visited Dr.Teena mam and explained her about our situation. Firstly, she was very patient to listen our history and the problems we had. She thoroughly reviewed all previous investigations and informed the possible reasons for the miscarriages. \nMadam was very positive and convinced us to continue the pregnancy. However, we were still worried of further unknown complications. Madam really took a special care of my wife, regularly monitored, advised her with a healthy diet plan with simple exercise and asked my wife to strictly follow for better health of both. She was in regular touch with us throughout the pregnancy and we could reach her anytime. This really helped us to stay positive and my wife was very much attached to madam. Finally, with all the support and guidance, my wife normally delivered baby boy, we are so blessed to see healthy baby.\nHer patience, positive approach, guidance and the trust we had that madam will be there during any complications kept us positive. We are very happy and feel a complete family now.",

I was planning for pregnancy from past 2 years but I wasn't and  after taking treatment from Teena , within 4 months I got conceived.\nIt's apparent that Dr.Teena really care about patients. The way she handles patient is very much impressive. She prefers C-Section surgery when it is really required only. I never found commerc nature in her. I was in impression that I can't go for normal delivery as I am very lean and not having that much strength so got very scared about normal delivery and requested for C-section , Even though I asked for C-section delivery she didn't go for it and I got normal delivery and blessed with baby girl.\nNowadays doctors don't have time to give proper treatment to patients because of their busy schedules but Dr.Teena will give sufficient time to each patient.\n*** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** I can't thank you enough for the excellent care she has provided.  Thank you so much for the great treatment.",

I always kept Dr Teena informed about anything which I felt was odd. Her responsiveness helped me keep myself calm/positive and also avoided unnecessary trips to the clinic for every small question.",

Since my wife was very weak, we were in dilemma whether to continue the pregnancy.\nUpon advise by our colleague, we visited Dr.Teena mam and explained her about our situation. Firstly, she was very patient to listen our history and the problems we had. She thoroughly reviewed all previous investigations and informed the possible reasons for the miscarriages. \nMadam was very positive and convinced us to continue the pregnancy. However, we were still worried of further unknown complications. Madam really took a special care of my wife, regularly monitored, advised her with a healthy diet plan with simple exercise and asked my wife to strictly follow for better health of both. She was in regular touch with us throughout the pregnancy and we could reach her anytime. This really helped us to stay positive and my wife was very much attached to madam. Finally, with all the support and guidance, my wife normally delivered baby boy, we are so blessed to see healthy baby.\nHer patience, positive approach, guidance and the trust we had that madam will be there during any complications kept us positive. We are very happy and feel a complete family now.",

This made me think that if she can examine a patient who's checkup  is complementary one then how she will treat her own patients..\n\nSo the day I got pregnant,  I went to her without doubt.. She does her practice very ethically,  n does not make your pregnancy part of today's corporate health industry.  \n\nWhen I went to my home town n started consulting other gynaecologists, I actually realized how comfortable she made my pregnancy whereas other doctor were scaring me for compliacations n c-sections. I reached out to her again,  followed her advice n had a comfortable  normal delivery and a 3.5 kg healthy baby girl.  \n",
