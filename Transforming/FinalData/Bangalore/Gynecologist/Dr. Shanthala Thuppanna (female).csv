"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hysterectomy (Abdominal/Vaginal),",0,0,YES,I consulted her for a hysterectomy because fibroids was causing excessive heavy bleeding that left me severely anemic and affected my lifestyle very badly. She counseled me very well before the surgery explaining the process options and risks. She gave me the confidence to go ahead with the surgery. She and her excellent surgical team did a fantastic job and the post recovery was so smooth that it surprised me. I could walk in a few hours after surgery and went home after 48 hours. She told me what to follow after surgery and was very confident and explained everything in details which helps to take decisions and set expectations. Highly recommend her for any gynecology issue. I trust her and the team at Sakra to do an excellent job and the best care in Bangalore. ,2021-09-08 06:36:58,False,True,Piya Bose,"Thank you for taking the time to write this review.

I was taking medications to relieve my symptoms and avoid surgery. Things were going fine until recently when my doctor told me that my endometriosis has increased in size and advised me to go for a total hysterectomy through an open surgery. She completely ruled out the option of laparoscopy. Since it was a complex surgery, we decided to go for a second opinion. After reading positive reviews about Dr. Shanthala Thuppanna, we approached her at Sakra World Hospital.  She was confident that the surgery could be performed laparoscopically and only in a complex scenario would she do an open surgery. She answered all my queries patiently and we decided to go with her. Her coordinator ensured the entire process from hospitalisation to discharge was smooth.  My surgery (Total hysterectomy + Bilateral Salpingo Oopherectomy) was done laparoscopically which made me little relaxed and my post surgery issues were also very well taken care of by her dedicated team of doctors and nurses before I was discharged. The hospital staff was also very cooperative and helpful.

I requested her to give few min for me to breathe/relax before the pap smear test as I was doing it after a long time. Instead of giving me the time , she forced the test before I was ready , was talking very loudly and said that i need to hurry up with the test as she has more patients to see. This shows that she had absolutely no empathy nor patience. The main quality that is needed for a doctor that too a Gynaecologist is to put the patient at ease , give comfort & confidence. Not cause extreme pain, tension & stress.
