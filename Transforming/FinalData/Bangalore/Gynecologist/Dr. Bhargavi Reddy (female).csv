What added to my disappointment was the lack of information provided about my condition. Dr. Reddy did not take the time to explain the nature of my infection or the reasons behind my symptoms. Instead, she swiftly prescribed medication without any detailed explanation. This left me feeling uninformed and unsure about my treatment plan.

Furthermore, the doctor's approach to follow-up care was lacking. After prescribing the medication, Dr. Reddy simply instructed me to return for a follow-up appointment after a week, without providing any further guidance or support.

Overall, my experience with Dr. Bhargavi Reddy at Life Plus Hospital was disheartening, and I would not recommend her services to anyone seeking compassionate and informative medical care. I believe that a patient's well-being should be treated with respect and empathy, qualities that were sorely lacking in this encounter.

"Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Doctor friendliness,","Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Greeting for the day , 
Hope all are doing well and congratulations for all future mommies and daddies😊😊

We consulted Dr.Bhargavi reddy from beginning of our pregnancy. Initially we admitted for emergency and continued for full term.  Doctor is experienced in assistance, decisions  and medications. She was clear on her decision based on the patient condition/History , We have been assisted with choice of Normal delivery and by God's Grace our delivery  happened within a day. All staffs are friendly and In-patient nurses/visiting doctors are very kind. 
Overall for pregnancy care Lifeplus is a better choice when it comes to consultation charges, reachability and experience. Thanks to all staffs , we were blessed with baby boy on 01/08/2020.
we see issues with Scan wait time , Frequent changes with medicine companies and Hospital environment. We suggested to improve in these areas as well. 

Take care
