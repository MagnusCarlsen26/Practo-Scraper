"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Caesarean Section (C Section),Ovarian Cyst Removal,",0,0,YES,"Absolutely wonderful experience under Dr. Shefali Tyagi and her team.

I continued my entire pregnancy journey under a different doctor as it was closer to my home, despite having no comfort with the doctor. I assumed that the doctor being knowledgeable was sufficient and that patients can’t expect to be treated with respect or empathy. I had friends who had delivered under her care but since Sarjapur is far from my location, I didn’t want to travel in such horrible roads, without knowing if the experience would be worth it.

Somehow, out of anxiety regarding an uncomfortable birth experience, at 37th week, I decided to give Dr. Shefali Tyagi a try. It was an instant click. Her proficiency, knowledge and empathy was unparalleled. The fact that I thought doctors will always be unempathetic and irritated if they are busy, was thrown out of the window instantly. She was respectful of the birth plan I wished for. She explained me the pros and cons of my choice and what other alternative I had, which she could help me with. But once I made up my mind, she helped me in each step through it.

I delivered under her on February first week and my baby is one week old now. My delivery experience and subsequent visits to her have been wonderful. Within a week, I feel almost fine. The doctor I had been in touch with for 9 months never gave me an email id to contact during emergencies. Even during visits, anything we asked was met with irritated replies. She suggested going to the hospital emergency for any doubt and that’s what we did every time, for 9 months.

With Dr. Shefali Tyagi, from day 1 she had shared her email ID and has always responded to emergency/nonemergency doubt within less than an hour, even though I had just started to visit her. I wish I had this kind of support throughout my pregnancy.

During the time I was at the hospital, she even treated my mother for a long-standing issue and my mother was happy with the experience too. Since I had willingly opted for a C-section, she also removed an ovarian cyst for me, which had been there for 15 years almost. 

Would absolutely recommend the doctor. Finally, I had an amazing birth experience, which I had absolutely lost hope for. I don’t have a single thing to complain about.",2023-02-16 14:17:22,False,True,Samanwita,,,

Here, My story goes..

It was first time Corona crisis in 2020.. I and my husband (my husband was in BLR because of his office location and I came there to visit him) were stuck in Bangalore during My 5 months of Pregnancy though my treatment was going-on in my Hometown..

At that time I was recommended to “some other Doctor” in Koramangala for my regular check ups , She was continuously doing Ultrasound to check foetus condition and informed Us that My baby has 2 round of umbilical cord in it’s neck..also have given wrong information that my baby’s growth is not appropriate..It was Corona days so we were not ready to switch to any other Doctor because of Corona precautions/ risky factor for pregnant women and we have Trusted Her without doubting.. We have also requested her for normal delivery and told about our situation..so on early days she was assuring for normal delivery but on the day my water broke, she was all the Sudden like “we can’t go for Normal delivery, we need to take her to 
c-section because of the 2 rounds of the umbilical cord..We were verge of nowhere..
( Marvel Multi-speciality Hospital / Dr. Mamatha Reddy) 

So the Day My water broke by 4 o’clock in the evening we reached to Cloudnine Bellanduru and we have asked for Doctor Shefali Tyagi.. I was under her treatment in 2018 for some minor gynaecological problem, when my profile was sent to her, she recognised me..But at that time she was not in duty so we have requested to admit me and I was immediately admitted there by the duty Doctor, then we have narrated all our situation and told we are especially looking for Normal delivery..Because of Lockdown and Corona None would be there with us only I and My husband had to take care of the baby..
Then after Covid test I was shifted to labour room..
By the evening Dr.Shefali came and examined me and checked my reports and all..and I was kept in Labour for whole night and by the mid night I was given some medicine then next day by Morning Doctor again visited me..Then by afternoon at 1:29 PM my baby was born through “normal vaginal delivery (NVD)” under Dr. Shefali Tyagi despite of having 2 rounds of Umbilical cord in Baby’s neck..and my baby was born healthy with appropriate growth..
I am very much grateful to Dr. Shefali Tyagi and her team for understanding our concern and supporting us at the time of crisis by nailing the normal delivery with Her excellent skills..
