Then she did laparoscopic cystectomy, and assured that I will get pregnancy for sure, then we tried for pregnancy after few months and got the results positive.
Then started the 2nd pregnancy journey with her from the day I got to know that I was conceived. This time everything was gone smoothly. But found that my baby was in breech position. I was worried because of the breech presentation of a baby. But Mam had a strong belief that baby would turn to normal position. For that she suggested some excercises. In the next scan baby turned little bit and was in the transverse position. And she suggested me to continue the same exercises. Finally baby head is down. Seriously I was very worried about the position of baby. But mam was confident enough that baby will turn. Her words and the explanation helps to reduce the stress of pregnancy.

Eventually I went through IVF treatment from a renowned IVF center in Bangalore. Dr. Rituparna was always in touch and watched over the process. Unfortunately, the treatment did not work out.

Dr. Ritu took utmost care in solving the problem, timely scanning and checkup, antenatal care and delivery of the baby.

I have been married for 10 years now and we have been trying to conceive since the second year of marriage. I consulted many doctors in various streams of medicines like ayurveda, homeopathy and allopathy. I also underwent the laparoscopic surgery to burn few ovarian cysts. All the doctors I consulted were focused on ovarian induction and conception. None of them focused on curing the underlying issue of PCOD. We moved to HBR layout in Bangalore and started looking for a good gynecologist again. We found about Dr. Rituparna Beria Sarkar through Google reviews and decided to consult her. From day one of consultation, her approach towards the treatment was logical and convincing. The way she interacted with the patients was very welcoming and friendly. She patiently heard to all our concerns and explained the line of treatment clearly. While all other doctors inclined towards IVF, Dr. Ritu was very clear that we will go for IVF as a last option. She targeted the core issue, PCOD directly through medication. We were able to conceive in just a few months of treatment, but it was a failed conception. But Dr. Ritu filled us with hope and positivity. We were able to conceive again through IUI within about 18 months of treatment with Dr. Ritu and we are blessed with a baby girl now. Even for delivery, her focus was to do a normal delivery until the last minute.",2024-04-17 14:10:43,False,True,Madhushree,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We consulted Doctor Ritu parna for our first baby. Both of us are not Bangalore based. So initially we were hesitant to deliver in Bangalore as we were informed that doctors here aren‚Äôt patient enough to do normal delivery. After various research, we came across dr Ritu Parna profile in google with lot of good reviews, and as it was listed nearby our house, so we thought to give a try. To our utter satisfaction from day 1 she greeted and welcomed us with a smile. She is patient enough, doesn‚Äôt rush through, she clarifies all your doubts. Most importantly she informs what is only needed to be known. Even though I ask the silliest or dumbest questions she doesn‚Äôt shy away but answers them mockingly. She is so dedicated to her job that not one day have we seen her take leave or report late. From morning to late evening, she is in clinic and late nights to and fro to hospitals delivering babies. She is a passionate doc who seems to work round the clock. I have never seen a doctor with such true dedication and sincerity. She doesn‚Äôt charge you with lot of tests or scans especially gives tablets which are only necessary. I was low on vitamin d asked her to prescribe tablet she refused and insisted that I get enough sunlight. I had few complications low lying placenta, low amniotic fluid and growth restriction but she didn‚Äôt not scare me with any of these conditions, in fact when I felt so low and negative, she scolded me to see things positively. She suggested me only walking because of my complications and when baby was nearing full term and when most of conditions were eradicated, she suggested few exercises for normal delivery which I couldn‚Äôt do full-fledged due to my weight gain and knee pain. On my labour day, she took wise decision of enabling me to undergo most of the pain at the comfort of my home and when the intensity increased only then I was admitted in hospital and doc irrespective of her sickness rushed to the hospital exactly at the time when my labour kick started. To conclude in a line, Doc Ritu is an answered prayer. My prayer was that I should be guided by a doctor who doesn‚Äôt intervene medically or scientifically in the beautiful art of the Lords hands raising a new life from the womb to the world, painlessly. And yes, I delivered naturally almost without much pain as I was blessed by God to undergo precipitated labour within one and half hours my baby girl was in my hands. Thank you doc, you are a God sent angel who had delivered my baby. Never seen such a doctor who is humble, down to earth and sweet person by heart who doesn‚Äôt show-off.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Rituparna for PCOD treatment and pregnancy planning. We decided that Dr. Ritu is going to be our doctor for our pregnancy journey at the first consultation.Dr. Ritu clearly explained us the problem and course of plan for the treatment, she never hurried upon things and always took one step at time and was very passionate in what she was doing.The treatment began with few lifestyle changes and few medications that Dr. Ritu had prescribed. During the initial few days, it wasn't easy for me to do adopt to the lifestyle modifications that doctor had suggested but she kept motivating and encouraging me to push harder with few simple suggestions, these suggestions which helped me to make the lifestyle changes.As some cysts were still persistent and was not supporting us to conceive, doctor suggested us Ovulation Induction(OI) for conception. There started our pregnancy journey, in two months of OI, I luckily conceived. From there on doctor guided me all the blood tests and scans to be performed, on a timely basis she explained what test/scan had to be done and for what and no unnecessary test/scan was prescribed. Things were going as expected uptill the seventh month of pregnancy, during the growth scan in the seventh month doctor diagnosied that there was a growth restriction in the baby due to a restriction in blood flow. This made us to panic and were not clear on the next steps, doctor understood what we were going through and helped us to understand the situation and not to panic and told us that she is there to handle it and she will take care of it. Then just to rule out any anamolies in the scan, doctor suggested us to repeat the scan in 1-2 different centers over a time range of 1-2 weeks. When those scan reports too diagnosied growth restriction, doctor counselled us on the next steps and kept me in close monitoring where I was sending daily fetal movement counts directly to doctor. So it was clear by now that I was not going to complete my entire pregnancy term as it was going to very risky for my baby, at the same time doctor was also not in favour of delivering the baby immediately even though there was growth restriction to the baby inside me. She told us that it is better for the baby to stay inside than to deliver it early, as long as it not concerning any danger to the baby and the mother. She prolonged the baby's stay inside for a few more weeks with close monitoring and started few medications parallely for organ development for the baby, as we expected an early delivery. Just when the blood flow restriction was starting to deteriorate, doctor asked me to get admitted immediately and kept me under close observation. This deterioration was still not causing any harm to the baby or me yet, so she was trying to prolong the delivery by few more hours so that baby gets somemore time inside me. After a few hours of close observation in the hospital, doctor advised the right time for delivey and after our consent she delivered me by a C-Section to welcome a baby boy. After a few days of medical attention to the baby at the hospital, during which too Dr.Ritu kept following up on the baby's health with both us as well as the pediatricians taking care of the baby. We are now a happy family with our first child.We thank Dr. Rituparna for all the attention and care she has shown on us, for explaining and clearing our doubts by taking enough time during our consultations in spite of other patients waiting for their turn. We started our journey with Dr. Rituparna as a patient, now we feel like we have a sister or a friend who is there to care for us.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"After couple of years sitting out at home due to pandemic, I wished to become a mother again at the age of 38.
When my test came positive, We searched for top Gynecologist nearby and on Practo we found Dr Rituparna.
Going through all the stories on Practo about Dr. Rituparna, we finalised her and booked one appointment. On our first visit , Dr. noted down all my details and explained us very nicely about all the DOs and DONTs in the early pregnancy.  From 2nd visit onwards She remembered all our past discussion and also explained need of few Tests due to my age but never asked for any unnecessary test.  I liked the way she extended personal touch all the time and most of the time I felt like I was speaking with a friend or a family member rather than a Dr.  After 7 months she gave me her personal number and asked me to reach out to her for any issues. 
Since then whenever i messaged her, she definitely replied however busy she was.  She asked me to message baby count everyday to her and I did so and whenever I missed to update her, she proactively messaged me to check if everything was ok.  She also suggested natural therapy for any other health related issues in his period. 
She always motivated me to go for Normal delivery but as my first one was C-section, I was bit sceptical and hence I discussed this topic in many of my visits but we could not decide until one day I felt baby movement reduced and hence went for urgent checkup. Dr scanned and found that all of sudden my water level reduced due to excessive dehydration caused by fever and suggested me to get admitted. Hence I got admitted at OVUM. Doctor explained that she would try to delay the operation as that time baby was 35+ weeks and was not mature.
After a day i took discharge as treatment showed encouraging sign. We followed doctor's suggestion and went for GTT scan and went to see the doctor with the report next day . This time doctor repeated my scan at clinic and did a matching of the same with GTT report and concluded the further delay could be harmful for baby . Hence after days I got admitted and delivered a baby boy at OVUM Hospital . Even though It was C-Section and I started walking next day and literally felt good next day thanks to Dr. Rituparna for her expert handling of the difficult case timely with easy and confidence. 
As baby was not mature and diagonised with Jaundice, we had to stay back in hospital for few more days for his treatment but Dr. used to visit me everyday at least once a day to check recovery and enquired about the baby.  I am really thankful to her for guiding me delivering my little bundle of joy safely. God bless you and your team and I pray that you continue helping would be parents with your skill and empathy.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Here I m going to express about my pregnancy journey from 1days to 9mnth and after delivery,
If i could have give 500 rating also is not enough because her friendly and carring nature to her patients as wel as the condition through out the pregnancy is well explained in each and every visits and regular chekup and guide us in very proper manner and also this is my 1st pregnancy always asking doubt and she always explained with patience which was appreciated.I never saw any doctors in my career with so much of patience and talk and explained each and everything very nicly ,also supported me and given advice for future how to takecare of baby or mange work and actually i can say she made me mentally strong in such a manner so that I can maintained my daily life . Me and my husband was alone throughout the pregnancy we explained everything to Dr Ritu about our daliy life, she always gave 
us support and care. After 6 month Dr Ritu shared her personal number to us for continuous follow up through what's app and also told incase any emergency call her immediately she will response which shows that she is not a doctor but good human being who always think about her patients. We used to send daily fetal movement count by 12 pm night time and she replied if same day. We choose Ovum hospital for delivery because cost was minimal for us but Dr Ritu always give options to all patients so that they can select the hospital as per their requirement. My husband was very much tensed till the time Dr Ritu came to hospital for delivery, my husband was standing outside the OT and wating for Dr Ritu, the time Dr came he was happy because I was alone inside the OT and my expression was not so good because of little bit fear. But before entering to OT Dr Ritu told my husband while taking to preety i will complete everything you don't worry. Eventually she came inside make me comfortable, gave me very strong support as like mother i can say, because of that I came to know I am in safe hand and she wil take care of everything. Before that everything was unexpected for me. As a doctor to do this much is unexpected only. Why because the story I heard of my friends delivery was totally different then me. I never ever imagine that it will be so happy and enjoyable moment in pregnancy which was possible only because of Ritu ma'am. After delivery dr Use to visit 2 times in a day for check up because I stayed in hospital for 3 days, I undergone LACS because of my many complications, But here I just wanted to highlight one things like dr Ritu always push and suggest for Normal delivery till the time patient doesn't have any issues. I like this things very such about her. I came to know Dr Ritu through one of my friend not from practo. These words are not sufficient i can write more and more good things about her and behaviour is fabulous it was really surprised that after post delivery also i visited her for post follow up and it got to know so many things.I just wanted to say her thankyou sooo much for each and everything maam I feel blessed that I know her... thankyou once again ma'am ‚ù§Ô∏è luv u and we will miss u.

In initial consultation she made me to aware how many test and why it is required. No unnecessary test .she also mentioned which is mandatory and which is optional test. Best thing in house ultrasound machine and lab/pharmacy .every time you visit and you don't need to run here and there for test and medicines.My blood haemoglobin level was low 10.4 and with her advice and medicine it was reached to 13.4.Second hurdle,she diagnosed and found nuchal cord rapped around baby neck,she asked me to track baby movements in a particular time and also shared her emergency contact details.Nuchal cord got off from neck after few months .She was tracking down baby growth in every visit and flagged for any abnormalities and area of improvement.She clearly mentioned in last month of pregnancy cervix is too firm and there might be chances of prolonged labour pain. On Final day when labour pain started I pinged her and she asked me to get admitted in hospital .She came to hospital and examined me.Labour pain lasted for more than 11 hrs in Hospital,I asked her to do C section.she said then why you wasted 11 hrs and again encourage me for Normal Delivery. 

When C section is trend nowadays even though she encourage for Normal Delivery.

After I delivered a baby boy ,Dr Ritu Parna Madam used to visit every day at Hospital till my last date of discharge and she used to asked  me and my Lil one well being and used to suggest usefull advice for reducing pain and swelling.

I am going to miss Dr Ritu Ma'am and her loving staff.each visit to her Clinic was like going to meet family member.

She suggested Ovum Hospital which was really amazing as no one came from my family so me and my husband had to manage everything.Due to her support and supportive nurses everything was so memorable for me.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnant Women Counseling,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Scan,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"From PINK to BLUE, Dr. Rituparna was with us! 

I remember the day, when I took the pregnancy test and it came PINK. We were very happy, for obvious reasons. We went to see Dr. Rituparna on the same day and she explained us very nicely about all the DOs and DONT's in the early pregnancy which is very important to know these days due to our lifestyles. 

After, our first consulation, with Dr. Rituparna, Me and my husband decided that we will continue with the same Dr. throughout as we felt very comfortable talking to her and most importantly her detaied explanation and assurance to me being pregnant for the first time. 

Dr. Rituparna is a fine mix of care and caution. I loved the way she gave me that personal touch all the time. Felt like a care from a family member. Also she cautioned me at times on the DONT'S - don't eat junk food/ don't let your weight increase beyond certain level and explained the reasons behind them. 

Dr. Rituparna never asked me to do any unnecessary tests nor scared me Into doing one. With all her instructions and advices, it all went well. 

We came to 9th month of pregnancy. Our visits frequency stated increasing as the date was closer. In 9th month, minor complications were observed like a little decline in baby's heart rate, CPR ratio bit below required range etc. Dr. Rituparna assured that she'll not do the delivery until it's time. And we knew we can trust Dr. 100%.
15 days past 8 months, in one of the routine tests, while doing NST. at Dr.'s clinic, baby's heart rate started dipping gradually due to the umbilical cord being tied around baby's neck. 
It could have been very serious for our baby had we not visited that day for our routine check up. I remember Dr. Rituparna came running upon listening to the drop in the heart rate volume and immediately asked us to get admitted for a C section delivery. 

The same day, 05th Jan 2022, with God's blessings & Dr. Rituparna's experience in handling complex situations, we got the news of BLUE. We were blessed with a lovely baby boy. Perfectly alright. Absolutely no issues at all. My baby and me were doing all good. 

I don't know if I thanked Dr. Rituparna for her quick identification of the issue and suggesting us to get admitted and get the delivery done, but me and my husband personally feel, that at such times sometimes each and every day counts. One day late and things can go south. 

I've heard, sometimes, some parents don't listen to Doctors when it comes to C section deliveries and then later regret after a mishap due to complication. But i think we should NEVER ignore what our doctors advice. 

Me & my husband didn't ignore the advice and today we have our baby healthy in our hands. All due to Dr. Rituparna. 

She's a gem of a doctor. I recommend Dr. Rituparna for all your Gynaec issues. ***** *** **** *** ***** ****",2022-01-11 10:13:14,False,True,Kalyani Shinde,Thank you dear Kalyani.. Enjoy the parenthood... ,2022-01-13T11:25:59+0000,Dr. Rituparna Bera
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"We were visiting Manipal hospitals for an year including the time before conception for tests and guidance. After my wife concieved, we were looking to consult a doctor who is committed to performing normal delivery as first priority. We were worried about the current state in which doctors look for reasons to do c section as over the time its price has shot up. At this point i came to know about Dr. Rituparna from a friend who stays near hennur who got his baby delivered normally with her help. I was moved by his experience with Dr. Rituparna and hence despite the Distance being more from home to Dr visit  compared to going to Manipal, i chose to consult Dr. Rituparna. It was a very refreshing and a congineal experience. We never felt like speaking to a doctor but rather felt like speaking to a friend. We got in touch in 8th month and since then whenever we visited her, she would explain everything in detail and with various examples to make us understand the situation. It was clearly visible that the advices she use to give us were keeping in mind that we need normal delivery. The choices of medicines, exercices everything was explained in detail and she use to always council us on questions we have which gave us peace of mind and only wait for the day. My wife's water broke 3 weeks before delivery date and we contacted Dr. Ritu on phone. She was quick to respond and asked to come to hospital. My wife was loosing the water frequently even when she was walking or moving but had no pain. In this situation c section was very justifiable, but still she said we ll try our best to do normal delivery. For which she asked to make no movements and gave her medicines to induce pain. In next 8 hours the dilation happened until 8cm when my wife was moved to labour room. My wife wasn't able to push enough and the baby was at the same stage for 90minutes with the head out of the dilation. Slowly the heart rate and breathing of the baby started to drop. At this stage c section was not possible and vacuuming also was not possible as the baby got some swelling on his head already. A team along with 4-5 doctors and nurses helped my wife to deliver normally and at the right time. The baby was moved to NICU straight where he recovered and was discharged after 1.5 days. My wife is also recovering gradually. We finally got a normal delivery despite a bit of complexity.

It was a pleasant surprise and our journey along with Dr. Ritu started from that day. We had no prior recommendations or seen any review to consult with Dr. Ritu. The first visit gave us the confidence to continue the pregnancy journey with her.

We had a tumultuous journey during the pregnancy. The scan revealed high NT value suspected for high probability of abnormality in the baby. All along Dr.Ritu was rock solid with our decision to continue in each stage providing valuable inputs and treatments. She recommended us the Marker and NIPT tests to have healthy baby.

There were complications due to low hemoglobin and age adding another factor. Dr. Ritu provides only relevant medicines and does the scans herself. Major scans she refers outside. Every month the progress of baby's growth was observed and my wife‚Äôs health and diet were continuously tracked. Under Dr.Ritu‚Äôs expert consultation and medicine it was all sorted out with significant improvements during the entire pregnancy .

Dr.Ritu is soft spoken, humble, confident and answers up to the point crisp and clear. This gives us the complete scenario understanding and giving us the confidence to proceed.

During the delivery phase, she gives options of multiple hospitals and we can select the appropriate hospital nearby the house. We had the delivery in Altius Hospital and she was there daily for the rounds. There was adhesions in the uterus to the stomach from the previous delivery and Dr.Ritu with her team in Altius ensured the adhesions were removed taking maximum care during the delivery process.

We were blessed with a healthy Baby Boy bringing a huge relief to us.

Dr. Ritu even visited us on Sunday assuring my wife on recovery process and infact she was more happy than us seeing my wife deliver a healthy baby boy and the recovery progress of my wife.

From the initial consultation to the delivery of my baby, the experience was nothing but exceptional. We highly recommend Dr Ritu for Gynaecology and Pregnancy even with high complications. She handles the difficult situations with confidence and positive results is rest assured.

The staff in her clinic Sandhya, Sunanda and Narasimha were very helpful always with smile on their face

She is most affectionate and attentive doctor where we came across.

Let me put in our journey with doctor here..

We visited Dr. Ritu Parna for my wife's menstrual irregularities and PCOD problem.
When we first visited the doctor, we gave all the previous records and reports. Mam considered all those and never repeated any tests which were already present. She started the treatment from that point.

Dr. Ritu Parna treated with minimum medication and conducted scans which were only absolutely required. She always insisted my wife to change in lifestyle (proper exercise and diet plan). After sometime my wife conceived.

During our entire pregnancy journey doctor treated my wife with utmost caring and guiding us through all the stages. She suggested all the exercises and plan to do for normal delivery (NVD). Madam used to be in personal contact with us during final months and used to observe daily fetal movements

For Delivery we admitted in hospital and in prior to this Doctor explained in detail about the procedure which they would be following. As baby's head position was not fixed due to more fluid, Doctor did ARM to reduce the fluid and suggested that after getting significant 4 hours of pain baby's head position will get fixed. After 3 hours, duty doctors checked the baby's head position as it was still high they've made arrangements for Caesarean section delivery and moved to OT, but once Dr. Ritu Parna arrived she checked and understood that head position was about to get fixed. So she moved my wife back to labor room and she did normal delivery (NVM) within 15 minutes.

I honestly didn't have confidence that my wife will be able to pull the normal delivery. but thanks to Dr. Ritu Parna, with her support my wife was able to do it.

Finally i can say one thing, Dr. Ritu Parna is a wonderful human being before being a good Gynaecologist.",2022-10-28 15:04:56,False,True,Sandeep,Thank you.. Enjoy the parenthood.. :),2022-10-30T14:25:12+0000,Dr. Rituparna Bera

I had gone through the review on internet and gave a thought to try. And trust me, that was the best decision i made though i had to travel a distance of 20km to see doctor from my house everytime.
On my first visit, doctor systematically collected all my information and previous scan details and she prepared a antenetal profile and one would really need lot of patience to do that and believe me i have never met a doctor before who would invest so much time in a patient. She patiently listens to all your concerns and gives the best advice in a most simple language that anybody can understand. She clearly explains the thing sometimes with a diagram too :)
I was diabetic during pregnancy and she motivated me very well to keep my sugar under control explaining the consequences which can be caused in case i m not within the range. Doctor is extremely friendly and you can talk to her openly about any of your concern and you can expect the most satisfactory reaction from her in return.
The fees that doctor charges for consultation is very less compared to rest gynecologists and its very difficult to find such a good doctor and its definitely value.
Doctor never suggested for any unnecessary scans. She will herself perform most of the scans at reasonable price and hence you need not visit other labs. She will never force you to go for C section if NVD is possible. In my case, NVD was possible but i opted for elective C section as i was worried about my health concers - wheezing and diabetes.
Finally, i delivered a beautiful baby girl on 14th October by C section, Ritu mam was the one who performed the procedure and whole thing took less than 15 mins and i was able to see my angel immediately. I did not face any consequence due to surgery and my baby is doing good as well.
I would definitely recommend Ritu mam.

Our gym trainer recommended visiting Mam's clinic once, and we started following up with Ritu Mam from day one after the positive pregnancy test.

I am delighted and grateful that we chose Dr. Ritu Mam for my pregnancy and delivery. I admire her professionalism and the way she carries herself so beautifully dressed. She is very experienced, very friendly, cheerful, and full of energy as a person. Mam is one of the busiest doctors who never leaves her smile behind even though she works 24/7 for her patients. She was there patiently clearing all my doubts and gave us a stress-free relationship with her during consultations. She is a great listener, very concerned about her patient's well-being, and approachable at any time. She is always available to clarify any doubts through Whatsapp, even late at night, and answers call even in her busy schedule.

With Mam's support and guidance, I was relaxed and smiling while entering the operation theatre and came out smiling after giving birth to a healthy baby girl. She takes care of their patients with the utmost care, so people are connected to Mam more as a friend than as a patient-doctor relationship.

I did a Google search to find a good gynaecologist near me and first reference I got was of Dr. Rituparna Sarkar. The reviews were very nice so i decided to have a consultation with her. During my first visit I was a little sceptical about it but all my uneasyness just vanished when we first met her. She was very friendly and we never felt like we are meeting her for the first time. It was like we are having a conversation with our family doctor. She went through all our previous reports and scans and advised us accordingly. I had missed my anamoly scan of fifth month and we were very tensed as after fifth month, scans can't determine if the baby has any kind of issues or not. But she has assured us that she will make sure a pediatrician does a through check up of the baby once the child is born. This increased our trust and confidence in her. She gave us her personal number on which I was supposed to send her daily featal movement count and whenever I missed to send it, she used to send me a reminder message proactively from her side. I wanted to have  a normal delivery but i knew it was difficult as my first delivery was a C section. During the end of ninth month, she prolonged my delivery for one week so that we can atleast try for normal delivery but at the same time keeping a tab on my condition as well as on the condition of the baby. But two days before my EDD, my water broke and she advised me to get admitted in the Ovum hospital. There also she waited for 4-5 hours to check if I get the labor pain nturally as they can't giveme any medicine to induce the pain. As the water level was reducing and I was not getting the pain naturally, she advised us that we should not wait for more and we decided to go for the C section only. The baby was fine and healthy. Post delivery she used visit the hospital twice a day to check how I and my baby are doing. I started walking from next day of surgery itself under her guidance.

Thanks to practo for helping me on finding Dr Ritu. As mentioned by many many patients, she is extremely calm and caring doc I have ever met in my life. Yes, because of her only , we decided to go for 2nd pregnancy. Her simple but detail explanation is admirable. Sometime she goes very deep to boost up your confidence. I have no doubt on saying, I met one of the best person in my life. Her confidence and positive attitude is something which brings enormous positivity in life. 
She preferred minimum medicine and scan. Since I already have one baby, I can correlate and make out the difference. Doctor, from the beginning told me clearly what to do and what not. Specifically in each trimester her advise on food intake was way too good. Even though the distance from my house to her clinic is significantly high still we never felt tried. One the contrary every time I visited her wonderful clinic i became so relaxed. 
Finally after passing 38 weeks of wonderful moments, delivery date came. Believe me, I had no fear because of her only. Similarly my mom and my husband had extremely high conference on her. She did my x-section with utter most care and gave me another best gift of my life.  
After delivery she visited me every day and the caring still continues üòä. You are truely an amazing doc. Thank you is small word for you. There are many many things which are difficult to write, which you can only feel. So ladies and would be mother just visit her once and enjoy the beautiful journey. No matter what, you will always be there in my heart. I am going to miss my visits mam. Will cherish the memories rest of my life. I definitely recommend her to each and every pregnant ladies. 
At the end, I would like to thank sister maya, vanaja for your help whenever I asked for. God bless you mam and your lovely team. Keep smiling and continuing wonderful job for society.",2022-06-23 18:23:28,False,True,Dipali Samai Maity,Thanks Dipali for your kind write up..

We are glad that we met Dr Ritu mam. She truly deserves all appreciation and accolades. She is very experienced, professional, calm and friendly in nature. I am really thankful for the way she handled my wife's pregnancy as there were few challanges. However she always gave her positive consultation and made her feel happy and stronger.  She is one with positive attitude towards everything and makes her patients feel comfortable. It doesn‚Äôt matter to her if it‚Äôs a day or night she will always be there whenever her patients need her (each time she come to hospital she will make sure to visit her patients and check the health status). I asked her ""when do you sleep mam, most of the time you would you be at hospital or clinic and her answer stunned me"". She never asked us for any unnecessary tests and the consultation fee is very minimal. The clinic is well maintained with the best equipment's. She would explain inch by inch about the baby development and show us the movements using ultrasound machine. We don't have to walk out to get any medicine, everything is provided within the clinic. very time you visit and you don't need to run here and there for test and medicines. She found nuchal cord rapped around baby neck, she asked my wife to track the baby movements in a particular time and also shared her emergency contact details. Nuchal cord got off from neck after few weeks by himself. She was tracking down baby growth in every visit and flagged for any abnormalities. She tried  her best to make the normal delivery but due to few challanges at last we had agreed to go for section. Finally we are blessed with baby boy last week and both mother and child are super healthy now.

Thank you so much for all the luv and care mam. We really miss your consultation sessions.

You deserve more awards and respect.

Highly recommended!!!

Dr. Rituparna was warming from day 1 and soon she became our Ritudi ( an elder sister what we call in Bengali) without we became aware of it. She guided us over the process with her valuable suggestions regular scans, timely medicines and relevant injections. Her clinic is well equipped with modern USG instrument (which she operates herself), NST test and medicines and injection. All of these are of utmost importance as the time progresses and may not be always feasible for the patients to do the scans externally. She took care of every single bit of her patient's requirements. She has  an extremely pleasent personallity, which cares the patient and family. She is attached with several well reputed maternity hospitals where the delivery could be done on the choice of the patient. Unlike many doctors, she always insisted on going for a normal delivery if everything is fine. We felt we are in the safe hands from day 1 and that motivates us to regularly travel for more than 15 km one way to visit her. She entertained us over phone and WhatsApp at any given point of time. She got an extremely pleasant personality and calm nature., she used to listen every problem patiently and give relevant suggestion for every problem. She Insisted my wife to send the daily fetal movement counts every day from 30th week.  She has been supportive during the operation( in the OT room) and even sang to console my wife, to overcome the pain and fear during that time. This implies how much confident she is in her area of expertise. Finally, we have been blessed with a baby boy under her guidance. Overall, Ritudi is a complete package that any expecting parents would look for and we sincerely wish her many more successes in the upcoming time.  She has been a blessing to us and many others.

We want to rate many stars to Ritu madam but it is limited to only 5. So 5/5 for the Superstar. Pls include more stars.

Married for more than 9 years and looking for a baby. Treated from big hospitals in chennai with no use. They almost decided to adopt.

They decided to go for a final try before adopting. Checked in Practo and got to know about Ritu madam. The next 3 months i was pregnant. Below are the reasons why we 200% suggest Ritu madam.

- The way she talks gives you a great confidence. You will feel, yes I am going to have a baby. This is half the treatment. 

- Regarding treatment, literally no treatment to me. She just treated for what s required. ** ******** ********* *** ************** She spend around 30 mins for each patient which I don't think other doctors do.

- Very less C-Sections. Ritu madam = Normal delivery. 

- Only 2 or 3 scans in whole 10 months. ** ******** ***** *** ********* No panicking the patient. She will tell what is required to be told. 

- Very important, you can take your whole family with you for checkups. Every body are welcomed. 

- Very nominal fees.

- She owns the patient. More of a family like relationship.


There are too many points to be included but nothing can fully explain the experience we had with her. As the journey is completed, we are going to miss Ritu madam. 

Not exaggerating, *** ** **** *** ** *** I never thought i could will have a cute cute baby girl. 

Now my return gratitude to her is be her PRO. I am going to call all my friend and relatives who are looking for baby and send them to her. 

Finally, Ritu madam said she s a small doctor.

Writing on behalf of my wife (Siva Ranjani) - we've been consulted by a couple of other OB/GYN(s) and unfortunately resulted in a couple of miscarriages before we met Dr. Rituparna (Angel in disguise). Ever since our first consultation with Dr. Rituparna, we've started to sense a lot of positivity and absolutely success vibes. Dr. Ritu has been (we're sure she'll continue to) completely patient in listening to my wife's life style and questions, then, Dr. Ritu clarified each and every question comprehensively. Most importantly, Dr. Ritu always explains things with a quick diagram on the white sheet for us to easily connect to what we've been discussing. Doctor never had prescribed too many medications or further unnecessary/irrelevant treatments (or) lab tests. Doctor had always advised the most convenient mitigations for every hurdle that might slow down the process. The way Dr. Ritu explains the reason behind the scans and visits to the clinic is absolutely sensible and satisfying. Despite the medical industry being unreal lately, this doctor had never uttered a word in regard to marketing or promoting. I recommend the most genuine Dr. Rituparna anyday. The journey has been a sheer joy. My wife delivered a baby (guys, please send in your blessings) on 19 December, 2021. We've always knew we are in the safe hands which eventually turned out be true (hence proven). Thanks a million to Dr. Rituparna from us and our family. God bless you for the service you offer to the couples who reach out to you with a lot of hopes and anticipation.",2021-12-23 08:27:20,False,True,Satish G,Thanks Satish...

After hearing us patiently and answering all our queries, we were assured that  we've ultimately reached the right Dr. We were so impressed with the behaviour as well as her patience of hearing we couldn't think of visiting another doctor for a second opinion. Within two months under the the doctor's advice my wife got pregnant. Since then whenever we visited the clinic, we were enthralled with the patience, efficacy & the depth of experience of Dr Rituparna. It was really a beautiful & most satisfactory experience of my life. Every time we visited the Dr no matter how trivial the cause is, the doctor guided us with utmost sincerity & dedication. We couldn't belive the care she took even in time of doing the scans in her clinic. I admitted my wife to the hospital three days in advance but the Dr. never missed to attend my wife in her bed & to encourage for a normal delivery, though we were really sceptical about it , amidst her busy schedule. On the final day of delivery we were amazed to see her coolness, care & efficacy in the labour room.  Finally we were delighted to have a healthy normal baby, though my wife had a lot of complications at the initial stages of pregnancy. We 're really thankful to the doctor for such a nice , perhaps the most beautiful journey of our lives. God bless Dr. Rituparna for serving the patients like us with so much care & patience. We're really great full to you, Dr. Rituparna and wish the very name "" Dr. Rituparna"" Is going to be a ' household' name in the coming days. ",2021-11-05 08:22:51,False,True,Palash sen,,,

My pregnancy journey was not a smooth one and I had several complications which included - retroplacental bleeding leading to early contractions and admission to hospital at 20 weeks.. due to the bleeding there was also a risk of baby being SGA/IUGR

I had to be admitted several times to the hospital during the 9 months due to early labor contractions which were getting triggered by the placenta bleeding.. Dr Ritu was there with us through each and every hard moment.. guiding us.. helping us understand what the complications are.. what can be done and most importantly made us stay positive throughtout the entire time.

My due date was 29/10 but since the baby had been measurung small and also my cervix was tightly closed.. she decided to go ahead with induction on my weekly checkup on 20/10. I got admitted that day itself and induction procesw started. After the second dose of medicine, my contractions started getting extremely painful and my water broke.. Dr Ritu‚Äôs priority was baby‚Äôs well being as it was measuring small and small babies do not tolerate labor well.. 

After almost 14 hours of painful contractions .. my baby heartbeat started dipping a lot and we had to go for a c-section and my baby was safely out in 10 minutes :)

Dr Ritu is an amazing doctor who not only listens and addresses each concern but also gives ample time at each appointment. She was in touch with me just like a family member constantly checking on me, my pain, and well being throughout the entire 9 months. Without her guidance and direction, i would have never been able to have a positive mindset throughout my pregnancy. ",2021-10-28 12:26:21,False,True,Mohini,Thanks Mohini..

Liked her friendly behaviour and the way she understand the problems and explains very patiently and politely each and everything.
Later for the pregnancy we didnt had a better option than her as i was very comfortable with Dr. Rituparna.
Trust me it was worth taking that decision. I had breathing issues which made me less confident for a normal delivery.
But each time when visited doctor for regular checkups, her words was giving me more confidence. More than me she was more
determined that she will try making it a normal delivery. Their was a chord around my baby, also baby head was little far from
the pelvic area which was definitly a matter to be worried. But she was confident enough whatever it is i will be going for 
a normal delivery. October 17th was the due date for my delivery. When visited doctor on Oct 11th for regular checkup.
Doctor told their are chances baby has passed motion so i need to get admitted in the hospital the very next day.
If baby had passed motion than chances of normal delivery will be less. But the challenge was babys head was still far.
I was not getting my normal pain so got the pain induced. Even after the first dose baby head was still far. We where worried.
But doctor gave us the confidence that it will be a normal delivery itself. Later second dose also was given.
Entire night i had to go throught the pain as baby head was far, doctor was their for us monitoring the improvements and
giving us the confidence. Finally on Oct 13th morning i had given birth for my baby. As promised by doctor it was a normal 
delivery. Also my baby was healthy without any issues. Im so glad for taking the right decision of choosing Dr Rituparna as my doctor.

We consulted Dr. Rituparna first time on 22nd September 2020. We were planning for a baby and needed some counselling on that as my wife was having chronic UTI. We were worried that it can effect the pregnancy and cause complications. 
But when we met Dr. Rituparna, she listened to our problem very patiently and She advised little life style modification and very few medicine. We were very happy to meet a doctor like her who is so friendly and gives enough time for the consultation.
Withing no time, the UTI problem was treated. 
My wife conceived in the month of December and since then it has been a beautiful journey. 
Initially, during the 1st scan, we got to know that my wife is having short cervical length which may cause complications like late miscarriage or premature delivery. We were very scared but Dr. Rituparna told us not to worry and She is there to take care of this. As per guidance of Dr. Ritu the condition improved and my wife completed her full pregnancy term. It gave us enough confidence. Dr. Rituparna was always there to consult and guide us throughout this journey of pregnancy.
Dr. Rituparna's stepwise approach during this period is one of the best experience we had with her during these 9 months . She doesn't suggest any unnecessary tests and medications which many corporate hospitals do now a days.
My wife delivered a Baby girl on 10th September 2021 and both Mother and Baby are healthy and it was possible just because of Dr Rituparna who was constantly guiding us through this 9 month time. It's Dr. Rituparna's constant guidance and motivation which helped my wife to deliver the baby normally without LACS. Although at one point during her labour, my wife almost gave up and she decided to go with LACS but Dr. Rituparna never gave up on her and made her believe that she can do it. She stood by her and motivated her to keep trying as it's a matter of just few moments.

Due to  this pandemic we thought of doing delivery in Bangalore itself instead of going to Native. After all research in google and contacting our near and dear's, we decided to go with Dr. Ritu because of good and helpful reviews in Google and Practo about her.

1st pregnancy is something which generally has lot of doubts and fears for any couple. Dr Ritu made our entire journey so comfortable that we couldn‚Äôt even realise neither any single stress nor been as doubtful for anything. She was very calm and encouraging during entire pregnancy and delivery, and coached us through it.

We don‚Äôt want to comment about her medical ability as we do not the qualify to write about that. But few things I must have to mentioned about Dr Ritu -

1. Responsible Enough: We are lucky enough to get someone like Dr Ritu personally call/SMS us during our advance Stages of pregnancy to know about baby movements and moms health conditions.

2. Very much approachable & friendliness: She described each and every concern(even some stupids questions as well) whenever we reached to her even if through call/SMS as well.  She even reached to us to know about our baby‚Äôs health even after the delivery(I‚Äôm talking about after getting discharge from hospital) as well. I really  appreciate her down to earth and very humble attitude. Our entire journey was in COVID situations and Dr Ritu was very much available during the strict lockdown as well whereas many doctors cancelled their all appointments.

3. Trustworthy: Dr Ritu is someone on whom you can blindly trust. My wife has developed some complicacy(ICP) in her advance stages which can be fatal(we got to know later on about this through different medical articles) for us. But Dr Ritu handled so nicely with her extreme skills  & confidence. finally we are blessed with a beautiful baby with our having any issues to mom and baby.

In the very early stage of my pregnancy, I humbly opted for one of the most coveted hospital, but I was disappointed by the expenditure..I took the decision of changing Doctor. As i was in my 15th week of pregnancy, i was desperate to visit a gynaecologist but to whom? Then I heard of Ritu women's clinic and decided to visit Dr. Rituparna Bera Sarkar. Apparantly she is in her early 40's but her motherly approach justified my choice. i was lucky to have her advice every now and then and she had a wonderful patience of listening the patients without any grudge. Her compassionate approach never let me down even for a single visit. She is so punctual and duty bound that , I can hardly recall if I had to wait for her ever. She hardly prescribes unnecessary costly medicine or irrelevant tests. During emergency, particularly in covid 19 scenario, she even encouraged in tele communication for her pregnent ladies which one can hardly expect. She has a wonderful coordination with sister in clinic and hospital. And sister is also very helpful in communicating with Dr. Ritu mam. The moment you visit the Dr. i am sure , you will always feel that she is with you all the time.  Dr. Ritu always encourages those who likes to have normal delivary.

Since this was our first baby we were very worried about the NT scan though we understand it was not a confirmatory test. The gynaecologist with whom we were then taking advice was rude and forcing us to go ahead with risky procedure.
But it was our luck at tat time that we found Dr Rituparna mam, who studied all our reports and firstly made us comfortable and helped us in taking NIPT test.

She is always available on calls and whatsapp. She use to proactively check on my health when my due date was nearing. I never had any challenges in my First and second trimester but my third trimester was a little difficult where i started gaining unhealthy weight. All the tests were done on time and i had no BP or sugar issues. My baby's growth was also fine. After 38 weeks, my swelling got worse. Doctor decided to pre-pone the delivery so that both my baby and i are in good health. She tried for normal delivery and i was induced twice. But my labor didnt start. Hence, doctor decided to go for c-section without wasting anytime. I delivered my baby within 50 minutes. Both my baby and i are in good health. she visited us many times during our stay in the hospital. And she was also very nice to my family members. I am very thankful to Dr. Rituparna for supporting me throughout my pregnancy. I am also consulting her for my post pregnancy follow ups. I am sure my post pregnancy visits will also go well with her. She is compassionate and caring towards her patients.

"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I am writing this review based on my experience  and with a sense of gratitude and Thanksgiving to Dr.Ritu. 
We came across reviews in Practo and went for our first check-up after testing positive with the Pregnancy kit, till today, our experience has been nothing short of fantastic. During my pregnancy, consultation with Dr.Ritu was the best thing that happened to us.
The greatest positive is the Dr.Ritu's ability to listen patiently to the patients about  doubts(silly may be) and explaining the complexities in a very lucid manner.
My pregnancy was filled with multiple surprises that I had to go on urgent cervical stitch to early delivery, Dr.Ritu's guidance was the one which made our maternity successful with normal delivery. There are not enough words to thank her, and we are indebted to her, though it's just her job,but the personal care and attention is something which you don't find with all doctors anywhere. 
Also if there is any doubt or emergency at any time, she is always approachable through phone and WhatsApp, that she would respond in minutes despite her busy schedule.
Our checkup and consultation during every week or fortnight has been more of a training season mentally as well that a senior or friend explaining things without much fuss,  we also get  mentally prepared for the pregnancy and other things to come. We are totally happy and satisfied to be under care and guidance and we thank you for everything. Never in my dreams, I thought I would have a normal delivery, since I was mostly under rest and did not much of physical workouts, but Dr.Ritu made it possible. 

At times she would call me herself and enquire about health and wellbeing and suggest how to move forward.

I am looking for a paediatrician like her, who is really good at her work and caring/approachable to her patients.",2020-09-20 08:44:40,False,True,Manipadma,Thanks for your feedback... ‚ò∫Ô∏è Enjoy  parenthood...,2020-09-23T09:02:28+0000,Dr. Rituparna Bera
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr.Ritu when I found out that I was pregnant. We got a recommendation from Practo. It was a great decision for us as she was extremely accesible on phone and WhatsApp. No matter how silly my queries were,  she always promptly responded. 

In times of lockdown she kept checking on me via phone and also asked if wanted to visit personally as she opened the clinic once a week.

All my visits in her clinic were nothing short of being delightful. She patiently answered all our queries and ensured that we are timely updated with any practical risks for the baby. She always made sure that we understand any situation and pregnancy related concerns by explaining in a layman language. We used to look forward to the visits. 

My baby was in breech position at 36 weeks when she recommended us to be prepared to deliver through c section. I was also clearly instructed to rush to the hospital in case my labour starts or water breaks. I followed the instructions exactly when my water broke at 4 AM at 37 week. I called her and kept talking to her throughout, while duty doctor examined me in the hospital. 

As per the examination I did not need an emergency C section so we waited for Dr. Ritu at 7 AM to proceed to the OT.
My baby girl was born at 7:40 AM through the procedure lead by Dr. Ritu. I was very calm as Dr. Ritu was with me throughout the procedure, explaining me what was happening.  She also visited me everyday during my stay at the hospital to ensure that I am well prepared to take care of myself and the baby.

My entire pregnancy was an amazing and memorable journey all thanks to Dr. Ritu.She was compassionate, patient and genuinely caring in all her interactions. We will miss visiting her regularly but she is our obvious choice for an gynaecology visits.

I would highly recommend her.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We approach Dr rituparna based on online reviews and clinic being near to our place and we made a very right decision choosing her as our gyno.our experience with dr for the past 9months and post delivery has been wonderful. Me and my husband we both stay alone n we both are working. This was our first pregnancy and there is no elder to guide us...so naturally we were dependent on the Dr and Google off course....and we had lot of doubts, silly questions. Now here is our feedback....

1. Dr Ritu always listens to your doubts and queries and answers all your silly questions patiently. She explains complicated medical terms in a very simplified way. She is never in a hurry and gives each and every patient dedicated time.

2. You can discuss your financial condition with her. She understands your situation and gives you a solution. 

3. She has a scanning facility and you can do the test at her clinic. The prices are reasonable. She doesn't prescribe lot of medicine.

4. She is constantly available for you. She also replies you on watsapp in case of emergency.

5.she is very punctual so never be late for your visits

Now here is walkthrough of my delivery experience.

My delivery was schedule on 3rd of July. And my first option was normal delivery...we choose ovum hospital hrbr layout.  so Dr had advised me to start counting baby movements..however on 22nd of June my movements were very less. Usually it should be 5 kicks in an average after every meal within 1hr. But that day it was only 2 after lunch. I messaged Dr and she immediately replied that I can wait and see till dinner. I had dinner at 11pm and waited for 1hr. There was only 1kick now. I informed Dr and she immediately told me to do a NST test. We ran to ovum. By the time the test was complete and we reach home at 2:30 AM. Amazingly Dr was awake so long for me. Next day we visited the clinic and Dr suggested we should get admitted as the movements have become less. I followed her instructions and artificial pain was induced.. since I was trying for normal delivery it was important that normal labour pain should come. But in my case till next day morning the labour pain did not come. I was told that Dr Ritu will come within 2-3hrs and then we can take a call. By the time it was 5:30am 24th June. While I was in pain and was only wishing to see Dr Ritu asap, she was right there in front of me. I was so happy to see her and it was such a relief. My movements were 0 and I wanted to go ahead with c section. Dr Ritu is so well  connected even though nurses were not available but because of Dr Ritu network nurses were there within 5mins and I was immediately taken to the OT. 

Thanks to Dr ritu's smooth process I delivered a baby girl and her name is DIA. 

One quick tip to the all the husbands: while I was in the OT my husband fell off to sleep only thinking that Dr Ritu is there with me. So would be fathers don't panic and enjoy the  moment.

P:S after the delivery I missed my family , in laws who could not come due to covid. And when there was 100 of phone calls, everybody going about the news I was really missing my mom and right then a beautiful thing happen,Dr Ritu came for a visit....and she told me I want to know how my little angel doing (and she meant me)..

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",,0,0,YES,"We had a wonderful experience with Dr Ritu for my pregnancy. Right from the first visit, Dr Ritu came across as a very calm, reassuring and understanding doctor. She explains each phase of pregnancy and also the tests and scans to be done. She gives enough time to every patient and does not rush through the appointment. 

Even when we got some results (double marker) that were not favorable, she explained both the positive and negative outcomes clearly. She encouraged us to stay positive. We waited for the NIPT results and thankfully the results were normal.

One big advantage is that Dr Ritu has her own ultrasound device at her clinic and she observes the baby, and we can hear the heartbeat at every consultation. She also performs some of the scans at her clinic. A few scans are referred to other centres.

One of the main reasons we decided to go with Dr Ritu was that she encourages normal deliveries without any medication during labour. That is exactly how my birthing experience was too. I had a very positive birthing experience and felt really calm once Dr Ritu was in the labour room. She was really organised and meticulous. I knew both me and my baby were in good hands. 

We will forever be grateful to Dr Ritu for such a positive pregnancy and birthing of our second child, our daughter. I highly recommend Dr Ritu to everyone pregnant for a beautiful pregnancy and birthing experience. ",2023-11-19 17:35:53,False,True,Mrs. Swetha Varun  ,,,

Dr Ritu was so confident and calm about this procedure and assured us that removing this cyst would give us a great chance at pregnancy and performed this procedure with grace and she was right. My wife was pregnant within 2 months after this procedure. Dr Ritu was there with us throughout our pregnancy journey. She made sure that my wife was on healthy pregnant track.

When other doctors suggested to deliver my baby early through c-sec, Ritu mam has handled the risky situation and made me deliver my baby at ninth month through normal delivery. 
She has suggested all possible ways for normal delivery at all situation. 
She also doesn't suggest any unnecessary scan or blood tests.

She cares for her patients, n that shows in her conduct. We were getting discharged frm hospital post our babies delivery, n Sheridan was very kind to pay us a personal visit to check on my wife's n kids health out of her busy schedule which felt very nice.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Gynae Problems,",0,0,YES,"****** ** ********** She uses layman language for better understanding. It was my first visit and very happy for the follow up sessions.

One negative thing I faced in the clinic was the receptionist's attitude. She is unfit for the role for the following reasons:

1- First impression was worse because I wanted her suggestions in terms of waiting time because I had left my year old baby at home and she didn't even empathize rather just ignored my question telling just wait.

2- She never had change of Rs. 100 to return me. She arrogantly told me ""what can I do?"" I was shocked with her behaviour and told her what if I go away without paying, she never answered for that but kept telling, what can she do about not having change and also told why should she get up from her place to get the change. I was upset and shocked with her behaviour. Finally, listening to our conversation the medical girl from inside arranged for the change from diagnostics person.

3- The receptionist doesn't carry smile while attending the visitors. After all the patients come with different ailments and would require some positivity as soon as they enter which is not seen. Only after visiting the doctor we would feel a sigh of relief.

Please train the employees on customer service and soft skills. This is definitely a barrier between the patients and the doctor which I feel is not good especially at the hospital. ",2022-04-30 17:48:51,False,True,Yeshoda,,,

But doctor, you made it an amazing journey for me. We came to your clinic for prenatal counselling, the consultation you provided helped us conceive quickly and safely with all the vaccines taken.

From then on, every consultation you provided helped me overcome the challenges of pregnancy with much more ease. You were always honest with me and alerted me whenever I needed to take extra care, like when I had the chance of getting GDM. Whenever I visited, I felt understood and encouraged. You have motivated me several times when I felt down and the hormones were working on me. Finally, the 9th month had been so crucial and you guided me well towards normal delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"Dr Ritu is a blessing in disguise for couples planning for pregnancy or have already conceived. She is extremely humble and polite human being with a heart of gold.
We went by Practo recommendation and visited Dr Ritu for the first time in Feb 2020 and from then there was no looking back. Soon national lockdown was announced and my NT Scan and few crucial tests were to be done but due to lockdown it was very difficult to find a lab, Dr Ritu arranged everything and made sure all my scans and tests are done timely and smoothly. The love and compassion she has towards new parents and baby is just remarkable. 
She made me stick to natural sources of nutrition without giving any unnecessary supplements. Dr Ritu helped me maintain a very active lifestyle, optimum level of body weight and a positive mindset.In the last few weeks she helped me prepare my body for normal delivery. This made my delivery process very smooth, my labor was short, no epidural was required and I delivered normally with Dr Ritu, her team and my husband by my side. 
Thank You for everything Dr Ritu

Me and my son both were doing extremely good. I have rarely seen Doctor calling patients and asking health, specifically at 3rd trimester. My feelings of those moments can't be explained in words .

She is a very humble and down to earth. I have never seen her getting irritated while you explain your problem, no matter how many silly questions you ask.

Despite of her busy schedule, she takes out time to respond personally. Dr. Ritu is not just a gynecologist but also, she supports mentally and emotionally in the low times. 
She treated me as a younger sister. Also I would like add that she prescribes safe medication. 
During my treatment of endometriosis, she gave me moral strength.

Trust me, this was one of the proudest decisions we have taken!
Dr. Ritu is simply superb. The level of personal touch, care and confidence you get from her is unmatched. 
This was my first pregnancy and like most of us, I had several doubts and prejudices. Right from the start, I found her extremely calm. I used to ask her innumerable questions, yet she had answered all of them. 
Mid of my pregnancy came covid. Even then, I found her taking all precautions & delivering her best (being in protective clothing for so long without losing calm is never easy!)
During the delivery time also, she was very supportive what she promised for.
I cannot recall a moment in these 9 months when I needed her and did not find her available. 
Overall I will give her my maximum recommendation.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I went to Dr. Ritu when I had complications in the first trimester of my pregnancy, having found her referral from Practo and I must say, I was impressed with her from the start. Her professional, yet warm and transparent demeanour made us realise we had found ourselves in good hands. She was knowledgeable, yet patient enough to rest my fears and answered all my queries to my utmost satisfaction. She also had her own scanner which made it easier to get checked except for the anomaly scan, thus helping her to take a call when the situation required without us having to run back and forth to and from the diagnostics and doctor‚Äôs office. Throughout our pregnancy we were faced with different hurdles, like higher than normal blood pressure, less amniotic fluid, less growth and finally less movement if the baby. All these were carefully managed and never once did we feel that things were out of control. When the d-day came, Dr. Ritu handled my labour and delivery very well, with a good head on her shoulders, even staying the night at the hospital as my labour was long. She ensured that I got the right care at the hospital.
I am very happy with Dr. Ritu‚Äôs services and would definitely recommend her to my family and friends. Thank you Dr. Ritu!

We were not with kids even after 6 years of marriage. Went to many doctors, temple s in both Bangalore and Chennai nothing worked. Then finally in Google search found Dr Rituparna and with final try went to her . She was welcoming and explained what might be the delay in pregnancy etc. Based on medications started in February 2020 . And next month unfortunately stuck with lockdown and we had to delay our checkups again . Then went again in may month. All she had given was medications and no unnecessary tests. Finally July 12th we came to know about our little ones pregnant confirmation. To our surprise it was  twins and more than us she was happy . From there on we had frequent checkups and followed all her suggestions and advice . She was always reachable any time of day , I still remember when I had to what's app midnight and got instant replies and suggestions. The expected delivery plan was march 26. But our little ones came out on march 17 th itself. Again my wife had a pain on march 16th at11.30 pm and I called her immediately. She picked up and confirmed it's delivery pain and needs to do c sec . She came to cloud nine hospital immediately and at 2.15 am and finally both my little ones came out safely . I just cannot simply thank her , it should be more than that . I pray for her health and long life to continue helping others like us.

Note : her fees for check ups are very minimal and she herself does follicular scans and NST. She explains all your queries patiently

During each consultancy and check ups she always explained me everything very minutely so that i should be aware of the whole process..She asked me to visit her only when there was a necessity.Moreover after i entered 8th month she asked me to reach her in her mobile number in case of any emergency.She shares her third party WhatsApp no. Where i can book appointment and share my doubts with her assistant. I do not know her name but she is also a very quick responsive ,genuine and helpful person.No attitude, very proactive and friendly.I am thankful to her also..
My baby movement was very less so everyday my task was to send her baby movements count every night before going to bed.She did acknowledge and asked me to go for NST when required.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"There are no words to describe how good mam is at her work. She hasn‚Äôt only supported me medically and physically but also mentally and emotionally. She always treated me like a family member rather like a younger sister.
I was about to finish my first trimester when Mam has happened to us. I was not happy with the Dr. I approached initially and decided to change the Dr. The best thing I really like about mam is that she explains each and everything.
During my second trimester, I have been diagnosed with Diabetes that too at its peek of 586. Mam has played a vital role in controlling my sugar levels, I have got admit in the hospital and whole night mam was checking the sugar levels and insulins to treat sugar. After discharge also she kept track on my sugar readings by regular follow ups and we ended up with the controlled sugar levels. She stood there for me 24x7 as she was just a message away for any of my queries and doubts. 
She has than planned my delivery and gave me favourable medications which are best for me and baby so that at the time of delivery there would be no complications and as promised she successfully helped me in delivering my baby with normal procedure of delivery at my 37th week.
I have only heard that doctors are like Gods until I met Ritu mam. She is the perfect example for the same. 
Here are few checkpoints about mam every new would be mother would like to go through:
1. Explains the process and the scans very well as you will get full idea why the tests and scans are happening to you.
2. Always available at anytime of the day and very much approachable as she is just a message away.
3. She is in the good term with other specialists also who would be needed for the particular scan and as a result those Drs also treat you like there own patients 
4. She supports thoroughly at the time of any mishaps. And get through you with the problem.
5. She delivers what she promises.
6. After delivery also she keep on checking what the status is every week. 
7. Mam is such a soft hearted person as she will make you feel like your own sister so that you can discuss anything with her without any hesitation.
At last I have got my baby‚Äôs guardian angel... Me and my husband along with our families can‚Äôt thank you enough for what all you did for us.

I was amazed to see that whatever she told at the beginning of the treatment those exactly turned out to be true.I must say that her detailing is exceptionally good. Every time we visited clinic, we got good feelings. Me and my husband were so excited when she used to explain the detailed scan. Any problem and she was there to solve. My confidence was built by her only for normal delivery. I remember when I said doc normal will be tough, she replied  ""may be but not impossible for you"". And finally she made that happen.  
Thank you very much mam agin. We are going to miss you a lot..",2021-03-01 20:52:29,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
