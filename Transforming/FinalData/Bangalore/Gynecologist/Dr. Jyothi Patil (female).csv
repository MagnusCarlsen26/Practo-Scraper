Reasons could be many, but when reality strikes, it becomes difficult to comprehend. We were just in the initial stages of that experience. You needed an able hand to guide you through these delicate emotions.

Our first interaction with Dr. Patil; she made us comfortable to open our minds and discuss any apprehensions with utmost clarity. She listens, understands and then guides through the way forward with a thought out solution. While the expectations are set realistically, this is done (when we look at hindsight) to manage emotions in case of failure due to any reason. For us, it was incremental information so as to set these realistic expectations. 

The interactions, explanations of the reports and the small steps of progress ensured that there was transparency on all aspects. Even when there was a setback, the negativity was managed very maturely. This also gave all involved an aspect to be extra cautious in subsequent steps. 

The professional relationship moved into a comfort zone where it became more of a family one. This shows the way Dr. manages her work and gains confidence in such a very emotional & personal subject. 

The reassurance of handing the baby in the hands was just not a statement. She ensured that all phases in the pregnancy and post birth of the baby were very closely monitored to ensure that the goal is achieved. Leaving out any iota of deviation or complacencies as the effort, time and of course money was involved. Her interactions and relation with colleagues, support staff and everyone in general is very amiable which helps even in the professional setup. The second opinions or references helped get clarity on any concerns.

She is an asset to the organisation that values her professional services. While finally it is in the hands of the ONE above, some of that work is given to her hands to be completed.

We consulted her for a second opinion after 3 consecutive missed abortions in last four years.
She is very professional in her approach. 
Of all whom we consulted, She asked for strict weight management before going for next pregnancy.
Though we were not convinced in the beginning, her decisions proved fruitful. As it was a precious pregnancy for us, she made sure not to leave any stones unturned.
The support we received from her on each month and trimester is worth commendable. Though she is handling many cases, we felt, she has all our medical history in mind.
COVID 19 was the last challenge for us. Dr went extra mile to make sure the delivery happens in safest environment possible.
