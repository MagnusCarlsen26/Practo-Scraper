,,0,0,YES,"*** **** ****** **** **** *** ** Dr. Vibha Rathore. was quite satisfied with both her follow-up and the manner I was treated when I first saw her at the end of 2023. She treats her patients with such professionalism and compassion. So helpful and guiding in every way.In addition to being a fantastic doctor, she is also a kind, wonderful human being who is cheerful and easy to get along with. Her services are selfless. Fantastic treatment as always. She is a highly brilliant gynecologist who also possesses human values. Great advice; these days, it's rare to find doctors like that. Additionally, she personally follows up with patients by phone both during and after treatment‚Äîa unusual trait in modern medicine. had a very secure and cozy feeling.
