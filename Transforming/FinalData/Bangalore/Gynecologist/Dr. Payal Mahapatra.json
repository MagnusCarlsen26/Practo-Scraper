Her guidance and medications was fair enough and got recovered completely. I was panic initially but doctor made me more comfortable and well explained. I have travelled far other clinics and left without results. But, honestly Dr. Payal is the best gynaecologist and would strongly recommend her.  Suggest to visit her. Thanks .",

She was not judgemental at all. She tried to understand the reason for weight gain and explained to me how weight gain causes irregular periods. And irregular periods in turn could affect hormones and result in weight gain. Instead of dumping lifelong medicines, she adviced me a healthy diet and regular exercise.  She prescribed medinices only to help me get my periods soon. My periods have become regular now.All the tests are conducted at the clinic itself.  Once results are available, we can share on a WhatsApp number and they get back really soon with the doctor's response. I truly appreciate Payal ma'am and her team.",

She was not judgemental at all. She tried to understand the reason for weight gain and explained to me how weight gain causes irregular periods. And irregular periods in turn could affect hormones and result in weight gain. Instead of dumping lifelong medicines, she adviced me a healthy diet and regular exercise.  She prescribed medinices only to help me get my periods soon. My periods have become regular now.All the tests are conducted at the clinic itself.  Once results are available, we can share on a WhatsApp number and they get back really soon with the doctor's response. I truly appreciate Payal ma'am and her team.",

A week after when we visited her for consultation on the previous test reports, she mentioned that she has no access to those reports(even when all the test were done in her clinic) and asked me to show those reports in my phone. She even tried to pressurize her to repeat the same test with anaesthesia done as the last sample was not adequate. Besides, she shouted on both of us for not taking the medicines (including antibiotic and painkillers) she prescribed earlier even after we repeatedly told her that we prefer not to take any medicine unless it's urgent and my mom experienced side-effects from those medicines earlier. To our surprise, her assistant asked us to pay consultation fee (600 Rs) as soon as we left doctor's room even when it was clearly mentioned by the same  person on the previous day that the doctor doesn't change anything for checking reports if we visit her in person within 7 days.

She helped me with all her diagnosis and motivated me not to loose heart and to believe her that she will bless us as parents. In the second cycle itself I conceived and heard my babies heartbeat for the first time :)\nNow I am a proud and happy mother of a cute little baby boy and all the credit goes to Dr. Payal who had supported me throughout pregnancy and she helped me with a normal vaginal delivery. I thank her a lot and would highly recommend her to all childless couples who are curiously waiting to become parents.",
