We had a previous pregnancy loss, so we were on the lookout for a doctor who was compassionate and understanding. During our first consult,we were very happy with her calming presence and friendly reassurance and decided to continue with her. She was attentive, always answered any question of ours (even if they were silly) without trying to brush it off, made sure to listen and be understanding of our feelings and worries, she recommended the best of specialists and ensured that she always was available to us. Throughout the tough pregnancy, anytime we were worried, we would would reach out to her and she'd support us! All thanks to her, we have our baby girl with us now and we will be eternally grateful to her for being the kind of support we needed. We would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a great Doctor who can empathize with you and be with you every step of the way. ",

Due to hurdles faced in my first pregnancy and which I couldn\u2019t be able to sustain, I was so scared when I conceived for the second time. But doctor made it very smooth by giving me all hopes and kept track of all my previous issues. Every time I visit doctor for consultation or scan I used to go home with all positive vibes. She is very friendly, approachable and always reachable through WhatsApp or call. I was scared in every stage of pregnancy due to my previous issue. But she took deep care and During delivery oh god she is so cool and was made me to feel relaxed and in few mins C-section happened and I am blessed with twins. There is a saying if god takes one and he will always gives back in double. That\u2019s my belief and it happened all because of mam. I would recommend Dr.Mridula mam for smooth pregnancy. Also I would like to express my deepest gratitude for giving support for all the pregnant ladies out there. Thank you so much Doctor.",

We met Dr. Mridula no sooner we were shifted from the gynaecology department when our surrogate mommy was 3 months into her pregnancy. My first meeting with Dr. Mridula become my last meeting as we were unable to travel due to the pandemic situation. However, she assured us the special care they would take of our surrogate mommy as travel was going to be very tough for the next few months. Her happy and comforting nature made it easy for us to be at peace. She was accessible throughout our pregnancy journey and at no point did we feel deprived of not physically being at Bangalore during our pregnancy journey. Her experience coupled with her happy personality added to our comfort levels as we were assured that we were in very safe hands. We would be indebted to Dr. Mridula for delivering the most precious gift to us, which is our little princess. I still cannot forget the moment when she came out of the OT announcing our little princess.  We cant thank you enough Dr. Mridula. ",

She believes in normal delivery and tries her best for that.In fact I could have never ever succeeded having a normal delivery  without her support and care.\nPrior to my consulting with her, I had had a late miscarriage earlier and keeping this history in mind , Dr. Mridula took care of all risk factors to pre-empt and ensure that those conditions do not repeat. Most importantly, she explained patiently each and every medication, the reasoning behind her advice etc.  making us very comfortable.I am pretty sure it is just because of her risk mitigation plan that with the required medications and supplements, that I have had a safe and successful pregnancy. She is also extremely responsive in answering our queries or need for advice during odd hours giving us complete peace of mind. She is a wonderful Dr. and I am so grateful & glad that she handled my pregnancy !",

During our first consult,we were very happy with her calming presence and friendly reassurance and decided to continue with her. She was attentive, always answered any question of ours (even if they were silly) without trying to brush it off, made sure to listen and be understanding of our feelings and worries, she recommended the best of specialists and ensured that she always was available to us. Throughout the tough pregnancy, anytime we were worried, we would would reach out to her and she'd support us! All thanks to her, we have our baby girl with us now and we will be eternally grateful to her for being the kind of support we needed. We would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a great Doctor who can empathize with you and be with you every step of the way. ",

Due to hurdles faced in my first pregnancy and which I couldn\u2019t be able to sustain, I was so scared when I conceived for the second time. But doctor made it very smooth by giving me all hopes and kept track of all my previous issues. Every time I visit doctor for consultation or scan I used to go home with all positive vibes. She is very friendly, approachable and always reachable through WhatsApp or call. I was scared in every stage of pregnancy due to my previous issue. But she took deep care and During delivery oh god she is so cool and was made me to feel relaxed and in few mins C-section happened and I am blessed with twins. There is a saying if god takes one and he will always gives back in double. That\u2019s my belief and it happened all because of mam. I would recommend Dr.Mridula mam for smooth pregnancy. Also I would like to express my deepest gratitude for giving support for all the pregnant ladies out there. Thank you so much Doctor.",

We met Dr. Mridula no sooner we were shifted from the gynaecology department when our surrogate mommy was 3 months into her pregnancy. My first meeting with Dr. Mridula become my last meeting as we were unable to travel due to the pandemic situation. However, she assured us the special care they would take of our surrogate mommy as travel was going to be very tough for the next few months. Her happy and comforting nature made it easy for us to be at peace. She was accessible throughout our pregnancy journey and at no point did we feel deprived of not physically being at Bangalore during our pregnancy journey. Her experience coupled with her happy personality added to our comfort levels as we were assured that we were in very safe hands. We would be indebted to Dr. Mridula for delivering the most precious gift to us, which is our little princess. I still cannot forget the moment when she came out of the OT announcing our little princess.  We cant thank you enough Dr. Mridula. ",

She treats her patients with utmost care and is extremely dedicated to her work and profession.\nThe effort she had put in for my delivery is really appreciable, she in fact turned up almost 6-8 times even in late nights during delivery time. She believes in normal delivery and tries her best for that.In fact I could have never ever succeeded having a normal delivery  without her support and care.\nPrior to my consulting with her, I had had a late miscarriage earlier and keeping this history in mind , Dr. Mridula took care of all risk factors to pre-empt and ensure that those conditions do not repeat. Most importantly, she explained patiently each and every medication, the reasoning behind her advice etc.  making us very comfortable.I am pretty sure it is just because of her risk mitigation plan that with the required medications and supplements, that I have had a safe and successful pregnancy. She is also extremely responsive in answering our queries or need for advice during odd hours giving us complete peace of mind. She is a wonderful Dr. and I am so grateful & glad that she handled my pregnancy !",

Ever since i met her from my 1st trimester of Twin pregnancy at MILAAN Kumarakrupa west, I continued consulting Dr.mridula for my pregnancy check up & post delivery check up. she explained each step of pregnancy till delivery & post delivery. Dr. explained the issues surrounding twin pregnancy in general & advised special attention & care . she is very humble, down to earth person.\n\n\nOn the day of my early delivery during covid lockdown. Dr.mridula was called for emergency from her home. Even though it was raining heavily on the delivery day, Doctor scaned me first & was there before i got shifted to operation theatre. Doctor explained me and my husband about the situation for pre-term delivery of my babies, I Thank her so much for the timely intervention & exceptional care. It was bz of you and your team that we are happy today, we now have our bundle of joy having twins, very safely and healthily delivered into the world. You made our dreams of having a complete family come true. \n\nAs God could not be everywhere he made sure that we have doctors like Mriduladevi . I am so glad, I came to her during my pregnancy. I am so thankful to her for treating me so tenderly. I also thank her from the bottom of my heart for being so patient with me . I know I was difficult at times (by calling her at evening & even at night time) during my risk in  twin pregnancy . Even if she was busy, her words of support to me has really meant a lot. I feel very healthy & mentally much stronger now. Me & my husband will remember you until our last breath . You will always be in my prayers... God bless you abundantly \nThank you so much.  \n\n\nLast but not least i am very happy with her friendly nature , soft spokeness  and her patience in listening & answering  to all our doubts by giving us sufficient time.\nOnce again thank you soooooooooo much. \n",

She is so friendly and listens to all your concerns and motivates us to be positive.  \nShe explained everything in detail and also guided us on what needs to be done  going forward.  Along with fibroids, she even removed ovarian cyst and ensured I am free from all issues what I was having from last 2 years.\nShe is easily available for FU after surgery and always responds to the calls if it is an emergency. We asked many questions, few might be silly but for everything she answered with the smile. Very happy to get this doctor as my Gynecologist. \nI will always recommend Dr. Mridula Devi A, for any gynecology issues. Thank you. ",

I thought everything is over but doctor Mrudula Devi helped me get the right treatment at the right time and controlled the bleeding which was due to subchoronic haemorrhage and later my preclampsia issues were also addressed so well on time she is always available to the patients and gives them priority. One of my twin had a fetal demise but she managed to keep up my pregnancy as the other twin was healthy and delivered in my 35th week. She is soft spoken and friendly we feel comfortable to go to her as well. Now I am blessed with a baby girl and am really thankful to doctor Mrudula Devi for her kind gesture and right treatment and guidance on time.",

She has been like a friend during my pregnancy journey and has a lot of patience and compassion. The way she handled my delivery was outstanding. Though i always wanted a normal delivery, i gave up at the end and wanted to go for a c section. Dr.Mridula stepped in and convinced me to continue with normal delivery as there wasn\u2019t any need for a c section. What she did for me was more than a doctor does for her patients. We feel so lucky to have got her as our doctor. We got our bundle of joy and all thanks to the Milan team. ",

We had challenges having a baby in past years and have faced several disappointments but thanks to the team at Milann, we are now parents. Dr. Mridula took a lot of care to ensure that from the early stages of pregnancy, various conditions were checked and constantly advised us in the dos and donts throughout the pregnancy from diet to exercise, sleep and medication. Dr Mridula always went one step further to sate our curiosity about the many tests and metrics and answered all of our questions patiently. I\u2019m grateful that we were able to avail high quality treatment like this right here in Bangalore from Dr Mridula at Milann hospital. Thank you Dr Mridula from me and my family.",
