She will give time for all the patients, no hurry up at all. Actually we were trying for normal delivery, because our first baby also normal delivery. The same thing I expressed to her, she calmly listened and told that, we will try for normal. We used to visit every checkup and scan report. The way she explained is awesome. First point I like from her is, She will not make us to scare any issues. She will handle very nicely and give the tips according to the month. We can reach her anytime and ask any small doubts. Our last month of delivery, Doctor wants to go outstation for 2 days. For that also, She message to us. \u201cHow r u and you have any issue\" . I never have seen such a kind of doctor in my life. \nLast month we blessed boy baby with normal delivery. She came on time and completed the normal delivery within 2 hrs. Myself and baby doing well. \nShe is very good hearted and the way caring the patient is excellent. Of course she is a very lucky doctor for us.\nI will strongly recommend her.\n",

First time we consult her, just for checkup. We got so impressed, She is very calm and patiently listen our all our Queries. Immediately She will smile and everything is going well. She will give time for all the patients, no hurry up at all. Actually we were trying for normal delivery, because our first baby also normal delivery. The same thing I expressed to her, she calmly listened and told that, we will try for normal. We used to visit every checkup and scan report. The way she explained is awesome. First point I like from her is, She will not make us to scare any issues. She will handle very nicely and give the tips according to the month. We can reach her anytime and ask any small doubts. Our last month of delivery, Doctor wants to go outstation for 2 days. For that also, She message to us. \u201cHow r u and you have any issue\" . I never have seen such a kind of doctor in my life. \nLast month we blessed boy baby with normal delivery. She came on time and completed the normal delivery within 2 hrs. Myself and baby doing well. \nShe is very good hearted and the way caring the patient is excellent. Of course she is a very lucky doctor for us.\nI will strongly recommend her.\n",
