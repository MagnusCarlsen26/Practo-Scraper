But after a consultation with ma\u2019am, I have got the confidence that I can do it. Also, ma\u2019am was quickly able to identify that my Fallopian tube was blocked and I needed surgery to unblock it. So I went through surgery in Motherhood Hospital on July 2023 under mam\u2019s medical guidelines. And in the very next attempt, my pregnancy was confirmed in September. With her knowledge and experience my entire pregnancy period was smooth. The doctor encouraged and supported me a lot during labor to give normal delivery. The doctor is reachable on the phone even on holidays, weekends, and late nights which is very helpful. The doctor took care of me and my baby's health and safety throughout pregnancy and delivery. I strongly recommend Doctor Suvarna Jothy for your healthy and safe pregnancy and delivery.",

Dr. Suvarna mam took the time to understand my concerns and address them with compassion and expertise.\n\nOne aspect that truly set the doctor  apart was her proactive approach to my care. Having experienced a miscarriage in a previous pregnancy, I was naturally anxious. Doctor took every precaution necessary to ensure the safety of my current pregnancy, providing me with peace of mind.\n\nWe happily welcomed our baby with the doctor's support.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Suvarna Jyothi  to anyone seeking compassionate and thorough prenatal care.

Following a friend's recommendation, we sought out Dr. Suvarna mam at Motherhood Hospital. Struggling with thyroid and PCOD issues, natural conception seemed out of reach. Dr. Suvarna mam's calming demeanor, approachability, and attentiveness allowed us to express our concerns. With her invaluable support and counsel, I achieved conception within a mere 3 months.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, her constant availability via call and WhatsApp eased any uncertainties. Welcoming a baby girl into our family marked a moment of profound gratitude for Dr. Suvarna mam's exceptional backing and direction throughout my successful normal delivery. Your competence and compassionate care truly made a world of difference, and I extend heartfelt thanks for being both my doctor and a trusted companion. My appreciation knows no bounds.\n\nI wholeheartedly endorse and recommend Dr. Suvarna Jyothi mam for all Gynic consultations.",

Then we got lot of confidence and started continuing with her.\nIt is really difficult to find and trust a best doctor like her now a days.\nNo unnecessary tablets or tests recommendations.   \nShe will not bother if the test been done in the hospital or outside. She doesn't encourage unnecessary consultations as well. \nFinally when the day has come for us and  it was a normal delivery done for us as she said during our initial visits.\nAnother experience that I had after the delivery was when I had to wait for my turn for consultation she understood that we can't wait any longer due to baby so she immediately called us and treated.\n\nThank you very much for all that mam!\n\nAll the very best for your future mam!\n\nThank you!\n",

In entire pre-surgery duration she made the things smooth and councelled us patiently. The surgery went really well.  Post-surgery also, we were very well councelled and she discussed the plans to be followed.  She is always there to guide if any query or tension comes in the way. I am very much optimistic to have our baby(s) in our arms under Dr Suvarna Ma'am's guidance. ",

She has been helping in entire pregnancy and baby boy was delivered under her guidance. She is very much responsive on WhatsApp/phone whenever needed. Her positivity and nature give more satisfaction along with her treatment. She is multilingual so you would feel very comfortable while talking to her.. I will surely recommend her without any second thought. Really greatful for all her support.. ",

The moment I stepped out of the cabin, she packs her bag and leaves. This is despite me reaching just 5 minutes late for the appointment. While I was in the cabin with the doctor, the staff asked my male friend to make the payment because the doctor can\u2019t issue a prescription without payment. Explains why she kept looking at her screen throughout the 2 min consultation. In short, horrible experience and not the place to go to if you have any gynae issu* ****** *** ********* ******* *** *** **** **** ** ********",
