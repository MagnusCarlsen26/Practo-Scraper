So the day I got pregnant,  I went to her without doubt.. She does her practice very ethically,  n does not make your pregnancy part of today's corporate health industry.  

When I went to my home town n started consulting other gynaecologists, I actually realized how comfortable she made my pregnancy whereas other doctor were scaring me for compliacations n c-sections.
