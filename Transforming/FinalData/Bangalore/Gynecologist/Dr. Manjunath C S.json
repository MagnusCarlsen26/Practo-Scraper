                "review_text": "We did a lot of research and read reviews endlessly for 2-3 months before shortlisting Dr Manjunath for realising our dream. What clicked for us in first visit was that the place focussed totally on Medicine and no extra frills. Unlike other places, first discussion did not start with sharing package details. Nobody was trying to sell us something. In simple and plain words we were communicated about our chances of getting positive results without creating any fear or negativity. No one tried to convince or scare us about the outcome. What worked for us I guess is faith.\nOnce we decided to go ahead, all our googling stopped. We entrusted Dr Manjunath with everything post that stage and we ensured that we took every step thinking about positive outcome only. Doctor and staff at BabyScience ensured that we were always well informed about everything, not less not more.\nStarting with 20% chances and conceiving in first attempt, the journey was nothing short of miracle. Faith in Bhagwan and Dr Manjunath, we feel that was all it needed. I personally never panicked and never doubted the outcome.\nDoctor also recommended us a very good hospital considering our location and medical condition. We feel he knew the kind of complications we might have to face and connected us to right hospital, with required facilities and very cordial paediatrician with whom we are still associated.\nIf you are looking for precisely what you want - the help of medicine and not periferal marketing gimmics, this is the place to reaslise your dream of parenthood. There was a lot that could have gone wrong but the positivity of everyone at BabyScience and our faith in divine made this journey blissful.\nThank you everyone at BabyScience, Shyamala, Shaon and everyone who helped us.\nI strongly recommend Dr Manjunath, have faith in him and all will end well :)",

What clicked for us in first visit was that the place focussed totally on Medicine and no extra frills. Unlike other places, first discussion did not start with sharing package details. Nobody was trying to sell us something. In simple and plain words we were communicated about our chances of getting positive results without creating any fear or negativity. No one tried to convince or scare us about the outcome. What worked for us I guess is faith.\nOnce we decided to go ahead, all our googling stopped. We entrusted Dr Manjunath with everything post that stage and we ensured that we took every step thinking about positive outcome only. Doctor and staff at BabyScience ensured that we were always well informed about everything, not less not more.\nStarting with 20% chances and conceiving in first attempt, the journey was nothing short of miracle. Faith in Bhagwan and Dr Manjunath, we feel that was all it needed. I personally never panicked and never doubted the outcome.\nDoctor also recommended us a very good hospital considering our location and medical condition. We feel he knew the kind of complications we might have to face and connected us to right hospital, with required facilities and very cordial paediatrician with whom we are still associated.\nIf you are looking for precisely what you want - the help of medicine and not periferal marketing gimmics, this is the place to reaslise your dream of parenthood. There was a lot that could have gone wrong but the positivity of everyone at BabyScience and our faith in divine made this journey blissful.\nThank you everyone at BabyScience, Shyamala, Shaon and everyone who helped us.\nI strongly recommend Dr Manjunath, have faith in him and all will end well :)",
