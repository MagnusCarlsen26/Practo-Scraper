I had been consulting Dr Jyothi fdurimg my pregnancy, it's Ivf dcda twin pregnancy. She was friendly enough from day 1 . Mine was high risk pregnancy with endometriosis so I had got all extra care and support from the Doctor all the time. Our monthly scans were smooth and everythin went well for 7 months. My water level was high and was put on rest in 7 month, I was also informed by Doctor if going innearly labour anytym after 33 weeks. We went for my scan and everythin looked fine and came home the next day I got pain and was rushed to hospital in the early mrg 4. In 10 mins Dr Jyothi was there to see me . This is her dedication and the most important thing was one of her hand was fractured, she didn't give up on her patients even then.. as I mentioned it was high risk pregnancy and I wasn't due still .. It was my week 34 and Doctor Jyothi tried everything to support me and controlling my pain levels i was given steroids for withstanding pregnancy but my body gave up andmy bp was shooting up and sodium level imbalance and endo cyst broke inside complications were increasing .. the whole day I was under observation trying to postpone the delivery but once Doctor saw my reports she came running to me in the midnight with her fractured hand and informed us that I needed to deliver at the earliest. It was 11 pm in the night.. whole night Doctor was with me monitoring my CTG and repeated scans to check baby s health .. she slept on a strecher that night outside the OT I don't know which doctor would do this for her patients..  her level of dedication is somethin i havent seen anywre..  early morning I was taken for emergency c sec and I delivered healthy twins babies . She was there through each sec of my battle in this.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Stomach Cramps,",0,0,YES,"Manipal Hospital has a well-equipped gastroenterology department with experienced doctors and staff, Dr. Jyothi Shenoy  mam in terms of treatment, uses advanced technologies and follows evidence-based guidelines to diagnose and treat stomach ache. She generally prioritize non-invasive treatment methods such as medication, lifestyle changes, and diet modification before considering surgery. This approach ensures that patients have access to high-quality, comprehensive care.

The staff Jhansi is approachable and readily available to attend to the patients' concerns, which makes for a comfortable and stress-free treatment process.

Overall, Manipal Hospital has a reputation for providing exceptional care to their patients, and based on their gastroenterology department's approach to treating stomach ache, I would highly recommend the hospital for anyone seeking treatment for their stomach-related problems.
