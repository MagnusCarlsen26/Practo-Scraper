"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi has been boon for us.
During my 1st child, We moved to Bengaluru during mid pregnancy of my wife. She studied all earlier files & took over our case. Thanks to all her effort, my wife delivered my 1st child naturally.
Such was our trust in her that we went back to her after 5 years for our 2nd pregnancy. This time again she rose to occasion & my wife delivered 2nd child also naturally ( a big deal in today's time).

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Labor and Delivery,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Hi

I was consulting Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi mam in cloudnine Whitefield branch for my pregnancy.i am a first time mother. and my whole experience of pregnancy and delivery is so awesome with Rajyalakshmi mam and cloudnine hospital.

She listens so patient fully to all your questions and queries. No matter how long your list is. She carries a big smile in her face everytime i visit.which gave me  a positive vibe always. I remember some consultations i entered with a big tensed head and came out with a big smile on my face. Never waited long to meet her during the consultations.

She explained me everything in detail regarding delivery and all. She is always focused on normal delivery.my baby's head was not in down position upto 38 weeks.she waited till 39 week by saying it will change. And yes it did. Unfortunately the water level was decreased and i got admitted on the last day of my 39 weeks for the delivery. She tried almost 16 hours for normal delivery.but my body didn't respond well to the induction process and some emergency situation occurred like my baby had done poop inside( i was having continuous cough and nose blockage but no medicines were recommended at that time as it might hurt the delivery process) and i got a C-section.

Will share my experience inside the O.T too. As i was in labour pain I remember before giving anaesthesia to me Rajyalakshmi mam gave me confidence there too to keep calm and everything will be alright.i felt like my mother is beside me.and it made me so happy.after that i was so relaxed and yeah finally saw my baby girl.
ALL thanks to Dr. Rajyalakshmi mam for the proper guidance and treatment during my pregnancy. I am fully satisfied. Thank you mam.

Even she observed me post delivery too. Make me learnt some exercises. And in cloudnine hospital i got all the facilities (bill was high though) and the nurses and the other doctors were so helpful and friendly.

I will highly recommend Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi if you want to consult for your pregnancy or any gynic problem.i am sure you will get your solution with all satisfication.

Thank you",2020-06-19 14:39:06,False,True,Swagatika Tripathy,,,

"Explanation of the health issue,","Caesarean Section (C Section),",0,0,YES,"I am first time mother. During my pregnancy I was consulting other doctor in reputed hospital. Due to change in my residence during my last days of pregnancy I consulted Dr. Y Rajyalakshmi on 21st(37th +1 week). Doctor clearly explained the complication which my previous doctor also explained. I could not go to my previous hospital as I stayed far away and was convinced to get my delivery done through Dr Y Rajyalakshmi. Doctor tried for normal delivery for nearly 12 hours but my body could not respond as required. So doctor decided for C - Sec which was than the best for baby and me. Even after Post Delivery doctor examined me patiently and explained me how to take care of myself. 
I strongly recommend Dr.Y Rajyalakshmi. 

But I do not recommend Cloudnine whitefield branch as the communication is very poor by the staff there. Till the admission I got nearly 5 different communications regarding the package price. And nursing staff are very rude. One sister literally threw a pillow on my body when I asked her to help me with an extra pillow post delivery. 2nd day I had severe pain and my bladder was full. During this time my mom called sisters for help. But not even a single sister or house keep staff came for help. Billing is hilarious. ****** ** *** **** *** other staff including nurses are not good.
