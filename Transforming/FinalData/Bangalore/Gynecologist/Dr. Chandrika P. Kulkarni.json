She is incredibly patient and answers all questions of anxious parents-to-be. What I found most helpful was her unassuming and approachable nature, that allowed us to share our concerns during infertility treatments without hesitation.  She was always reassuring- never once did she make us feel less hopeful while also being very practical. It is a refreshing change to be under the care of a doctor who does not over-prescribe tests or medicines while caring for your well-being.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Chandrika. ",

She patiently heard us out and counselled us before suggesting that we try naturally for a few cycles before going for IUI/IVF. In fact, it was on our insistence that we even went for the only IUI cycle that we did. Even during this one IUI cycle that we underwent, she took into consideration our inhibitions of taking hormone injections and modified the procedure accordingly. She treated our health issues with minimum medication. We conceived naturally after trying for just 2 months. She is a fantastic doctor, always available on-call to help us out with our queries. She spends a lot of time with her patients and resolves all their doubts and inhibitions. I would definitely recommend her to anyone who is trying for a baby.",
