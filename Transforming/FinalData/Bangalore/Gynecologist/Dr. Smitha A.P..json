Mine was a high risk ivf pregnancy, but doctor handled my case very calmly. She gave all the care needed but never created any unnecessary fear .. She was very open minded and inclusive of my inputs for every issue we faced in pregnancy.. She solved every issue I faced in pregnancy, some of them were risk of preclampsia, fetal growth issues, liver cholastesis etc..she solved the last minute issues in delivery very cleverly due to which my angel arrived in this world safely.. She continues to support me in my post partum period as well, always available on phone/message..I am thankful to her, who was more than a doctor, and on whom my family completely trusted and derived strength from during my pregnancy and delivery.. She inspires us to do whatever we do perfectly and fearlessly.. Thank you doctor!",

In the 2nd month, there was vaginal bleeding and upon Doc's consulting, my wife was put for susten injections on daily basis. This went on for 4 months. In all our consultations, Dr Smitha said that baby is absolutely fine and healthy, but bleeding and discharge was still there. The NT scan reports showed baby was healthy but there were some clots near placenta. We had been taking utmost care of her but still one night heavy bleeding started. We got scared and rushed to the hospital. Treatment started to stabilize but things started going out of hand. Even Doc was not sure what was happening. Her statements kept on changing. At last, Dr Smitha asked us to terminate the pregnancy. After all the pain my wife suffered, we had to leave the hospital empty handed and in tears. I wouldn't recommend this hospital and doctor to anyone as we ourselves haven't got clear reasons of what and why it happened. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude1e",

Her happy and comforting nature made it easy for us to be at peace. She was accessible throughout our pregnancy journey and at no point did we feel deprived of not physically being at Bangalore during our pregnancy journey. She also very willingly helped us with the permission letter which was required to cross the inter-state border. Would be indebted to Dr. Smitha for delivering the most precious gift to us, which is our little princess. We cant thank you enough Dr. Smitha.   ",

As a doctor she believes in the philosophy of less is more and saves you from unwanted medications, tests, procedures and gives you the confidence to believe in yourself which works as the best healer in any kind of pregnancy complications. In her able hands & empathetic approach, I feel the safest and happiest. Thank you for being the Doctor you are :) ",

She was very open minded and inclusive of my inputs for every issue we faced in pregnancy.. She solved every issue I faced in pregnancy, some of them were risk of preclampsia, fetal growth issues, liver cholastesis etc..she solved the last minute issues in delivery very cleverly due to which my angel arrived in this world safely.. She continues to support me in my post partum period as well, always available on phone/message..I am thankful to her, who was more than a doctor, and on whom my family completely trusted and derived strength from during my pregnancy and delivery.. She inspires us to do whatever we do perfectly and fearlessly.. Thank you doctor!",

In the 2nd month, there was vaginal bleeding and upon Doc's consulting, my wife was put for susten injections on daily basis. This went on for 4 months. In all our consultations, Dr Smitha said that baby is absolutely fine and healthy, but bleeding and discharge was still there. The NT scan reports showed baby was healthy but there were some clots near placenta. We had been taking utmost care of her but still one night heavy bleeding started. We got scared and rushed to the hospital. Treatment started to stabilize but things started going out of hand. Even Doc was not sure what was happening. Her statements kept on changing. At last, Dr Smitha asked us to terminate the pregnancy. After all the pain my wife suffered, we had to leave the hospital empty handed and in tears. I wouldn't recommend this hospital and doctor to anyone as we ourselves haven't got clear reasons of what and why it happened. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude1e",

Dr. Smitha, is extremely friendly yet very professional and comforting as she would willingly speak to me over after every visit of my surrogate mother to her for the routine check ups / scans. Her happy and comforting nature made it easy for us to be at peace. She was accessible throughout our pregnancy journey and at no point did we feel deprived of not physically being at Bangalore during our pregnancy journey. She also very willingly helped us with the permission letter which was required to cross the inter-state border. Would be indebted to Dr. Smitha for delivering the most precious gift to us, which is our little princess. We cant thank you enough Dr. Smitha.   ",
