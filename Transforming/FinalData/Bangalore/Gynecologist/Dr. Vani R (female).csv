"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Would recommend Dr Vani to all the pregnant ladies out there or planning to be pregnant . Please find my review : 

1) A lot of positiveness in the treatment . 
2) No unnecessary treatment or medications suggested , but all necessary tests were done and taken care . 
3) During covid and non COVID I would suggest this doctor’s clinic , as all tests , growth scans , medicines provided were done at the same place, need not travel several places , whereas other clinics I have seen this issue . 
4) Any time Dr Vani is available to attend your concerns , just whats App her . 
5) I had a normal delivery , with all her support and guidance. No hurry in delivering . 
6) Did suggest me the best things during my pregnancy , she was my second mom during my pregnancy as my mom was in US for my initial pregnancy months . 
7) Dr Vani does not fear you out with any health issues if you have any …, whereas other few doctors I have seen and heard they really fear you out. 
8) I personally was in search of a friendly gynaecologist, which I saw in Dr Vani , very soft spoken. This really matters as your hormones would be changing during pregnancy .  I had bad experience earlier with other gynaecologist who was rude.

When my pregnancy was detected , just saw her commendable experience and reviews of others through Practo and did visit her and indeed was the best decision of my life . Her visit timings were very comfortable for a working women . During delivery , she was in constant contact with OT doctors and guiding them the necessary steps .  My smooth pregnancy and delivery  credit goes to the doctor .
