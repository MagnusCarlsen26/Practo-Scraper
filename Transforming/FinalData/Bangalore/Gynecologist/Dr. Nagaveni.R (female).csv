While I initially met her to take a 2nd opinion, she remembered the background we discussed on the phone and was equipped to take things forward from there. It didn’t take us long to trust her 100%.

When I encountered an early miscarriage in my 1st pregnancy, Dr Nagaveni stayed very practical when it came to her treatment and left no stone unturned in our journey to becoming parents. She advised only the relevant tests to be taken at the right time, suggested the right weight, exercise and lifestyle changes, etc for both my husband and I, before we conceived again.

As for the 2nd pregnancy, given that I had fibroids, she recommended a scan to assess their position and unlike most doctors, did not suggest surgical removal, as it was not necessary. While the initial trimester was challenging, Dr Nagaveni was instrumental in ensuring all scans and tests were carried out in a timely manner and even checked in periodically between visits to ensure everything was on track. Despite her busy schedule, there is not a single instance where she has not reverted to a message at the end of a busy day.

Dr Nagaveni also took the required precautions and monitored my BP and blood sugar especially during the last trimester when uterine/umbilical artery resistance values were high on scans. Through judicious monitoring, she ensured that this pregnancy was not unnecessarily classified as high risk, which honestly saved us from additional tests, visits, scans and stress.

Till the end, she advocated a natural birth and shared the exercises, diet, etc to prepare for the same. However, on account of fetal distress, we needed a caesarean at the last moment. Even in the OT, she is extremely calm, confident and she and her team make the process seem like a breeze. She is a true expert at putting the patient at ease at this crucial time.

Dr Nagaveni has played a pivotal role in our journey to parenthood and we cannot imagine going through the same without her medical expertise, empathetic nature and positivity.

I must admit and will share my experience in short

1. Throughly professional.
2. Availability including phone calls anytime. To my surprise whenever I visit the hospital she's always there attending other patients either in OT or OPD.
3. Her courteous and patience, and responds to every concern we ask.
4. Trust the Dr. and you are in good and safe hands.

I went into completing full term and Dr Nagaveni was continuously monitoring baby health. Her advice was always best of both traditional and modern practices. This was my 2nd pregnancy and first one was induced. We were concerned on why im not even into mild contractions and labor in last 1-2 weeks, she was reassuring us that everything is normal and never pushed for induction or any other intervention. She was crystal clear in explaining us the next steps and helped me in delivering healthy baby full term as normal delivery.

I feel it’s incredible feat for myself and I believe no-one other than Dr Nagaveni who could make me trust the process.

Right from attending deliveries in the morning till midnight, she hustles between HRBR Motherhood and Disha Clinic. Inspite of such hectic worklife, Dr. Nagaveni’s calm demeanor and empathetic support were invaluable. I wonder how she can manage her personal and professional life handling those many mothers to be and be such a composed person she is. From past 1 year, she never postponed our appointments and we never saw a grim face. On the day of labor she assured me that she will be available within half n hr anytime during the night and she was present by 8 00 AM at my delivery as promised.

This level of commitment, unwavering dedication and care makes Dr. Nagaveni one of the best Doctors in this profession and We highly recommend her to anyone seeking a gynecologist who truly puts their patients first.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Cervical Cerclage,Pregnancy Check Up,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"Thank you so much Dr Nagaveni R from bottom of heart for taking such good care of us during pregnancy .
I have conceived naturally and have started consulting Dr from the start of pregnancy .We are glad and I would say it was a blessing that we had chosen her .
Until mid of 5th month of pregnancy everything was going smooth , but around 19th week I felt I am having lot of watery discharge . Doctor asked us to come to clinic immediately, then after getting the scan done it was confirmed that there is no amniotic fluid leakage but my cervix has shortened . Doctor didn’t panic us she told us to wait till a week , take complete bed rest and see . After a week cervix length didn’t increase so she asked us to go for emergency cerclage operation , we were very  scared and stressed but she gave us confident explained us everything . Surgery was done and I was admitted in hospital for 5 days , I would say she took really right decison I realised later . This procedure is for 1 day and many doctor sent you home after 24 hours but she asked me to stay and actually it was for my good and for my baby becoz if I would have come to my home there would have been so many confusion panic situation and if some problem  would have come travelling to hospital would have worsen my situation I feel . After this I was in complete bed rest and doctor was always available through what’s app message or call . Even in night she used to respond to my query . She was very considerate and thoughtful she didn’t unnecessarily asked me to come to clinic or go for Scan until and unless if it is very necessary .  
After 32 weeks my complications kept on increasing . My pregnancy journey became more challenging . But it  was doctor assuring voice and positive attitude which helped us kept going . I developed below complication 32 weeks onwards apart from the short cervix length issue which I was already having .
1.Gestational Diabetics .
2.  Severe Polyhydramnious 
3.Cholestasis of pregnancy 
4.Hypertension 
 But doctor always with her smiling face , knowledge and positive attitude gave us hope that for every problem there is a solution . She helped us manage and monitor each and every thing . The best part is she is very calm and never panics you by telling big big medical terms and complications , she always focus on solution and explains the approach how we will deal with this complications. After 32 weeks I was having itching when I reported to doctor , doctor asked me to do a Blood test . But even before it showed in my report  she with her knowledge and analysis has confirmed that I have cholestasis of pregnancy and she asked to start on low dose of medicine and repeat the blood test after a week . And yes she was correct my bile acid and SGPt and Sgopt was increasing . After that she increased my dose and advice me to repeat the blood test twice a week and do scan once a week and keep a checks on baby movement . She helped manage GD with proper diet and medicine . She monitored my case very closely and always kept a eye on my Reports and everything . After this my platelet count also started decreasing after every week . Earlier she has told us that due to cholestasis and other complications we should be ready for delivery after completing 36 week and she told she will try for normal delivery .This was surprising for me that inspite of so many complications she is telling we can try for normal delivery . But as we know “Man proposes and God disposes .” Around 34 weeks 6 days my bile acid was increasing too much , and so many complications were already there . Doctor recommended us to go for c section at 35 week as it would be risk to wait more . We have full trust and confidence on Doctor so without giving any second thought I got admitted on 26.02.2023 and 27.02.2023 our baby girl arrived . Our “brave girl “ . As doctor has already taken precautions before hand and I was sterioded  so our baby was born healthy and breathing fresh air . But since I had severe amniotic fluid some water had gone in my baby lungs due to which my baby got admitted to Nicu for 48hours . But yes , again her instinct and analysis , recommendation proved to be right . If we would have delayed it would have caused more problems, more damage to my baby . 
We are grateful to doctor entire team of motherhood hospital as well as Disha clinic staff . 
“Doctor is very talented , prompt in her response , very proactive and prompt and takes right decision at right time , friendly , and she always remember each and every  even minute details of her patients complications , report  which is something so amazing and impressive. “ We highly recommend doctor , you can chose doctor for your pregnancy journey without giving any second thought . 
Last but not the least whenever we felt stressed and worried doctor always assured us that if you come till here be positive , everything will be fine . I can’t even explain to what your reassuring voice meant ma’am . 
It was sai baba blessings that we chose her and are blessed with baby girl .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"It’s the Sai baba blessing that I met Dr. Ngavaeni and my journey of second pregnancy started in the guidance of her. What struck to me about her was her patience of listening to patients and give them physical and moral gain.

When I learnt that I had conceived, I decided to go to an renowned Doctor nearby. It was a Thursday. It’s the direction of Sai that even having the appointment with that doctor, my appointment with the doctor was not listed. Looking at my age criticality and the past abortion and recent miscarriage with 6 months, I was more tensed about the pregnancy and wanted to consult doctor immediately. Suddenly on the way to my daughter’s skating class, I saw the Disha clinic and recalled few of people recommended Dr Nagaveni. Immediately I called Disha clinic and took the appointment and met Dr Nagaveni.
I had always wanted a doctor who was efficient and contemporary in her thought process at the same time. She is proficient in her field- provides a lot of time to her patients, efficient in diagnosis, believes in natural medication and has an eye for detail. But what truly differentiates her from other doctors is her humanity.

Mam, u may or may not remember some of the instances but the following instances will be etched in my mind forever when I think of you.

1.	The first meeting, when you assured me that baby will be fine and I can still keep my baby. The words gave me a big trust on my Sai that, at this age with multiple complications, I can still keep my baby. 
2.	When I discussed with you regarding my elder daughter health issue, you assured me that it’s the Sai blessing, Its not 100% guarantee that my second baby will get the same health issue as my elder one.
3.	Its always you, when you assured me  it’s the Sai direction, even without any pre planning for baby and the point of restart my career again, that I am expecting for my second little one.
4.	When the growth of the baby was low during my anomaly scan, you gave me the strength that it will fine by 7th month.
5.	I was really getting worried about my kidney valve issue about my baby, you confirmed words that it will be fine by 8th month was blessing for me. Don’t know how your words came true, by 8th month baby growth and valve issue got fixed automatically.
6.	When my husband was out of station, and I was not able to sleep due to my mother in law’s health, my Blood pressure was so much fluctuating. You guidance made me to feel better and sleep better.
7.	When I rushed to you because of the discharge during my 5th month, I was really worried that my water bug has got burst. Thanks for reassuring me that my baby was fine. The moral support you gave me during that time was really helpful as my husband was out of station because of his mother’s health.
8.	When I rushed to you after 9 months, because of the pain in midnight. You assured me that it was not labour pain. It was because of the baby continuous movement.
9.	You always suggested to do deliver on 1st and 2nd dec and not to delay anymore as the baby is developed and its risky because of my health. My fluid level was high. Blood pressure and sugar level was fluctuating.
10.	Thanks for the understanding and did the surgery as per our fixed time on 6th Dec. 
11.	Thanks for the advice to do the delivery asap, looking at the condition, it was quite obvious that little more days delay would have spoiled my all dreams.
12.	Whenever I fell prey to breakdowns, you just sat and let me speak and gave me the support like a real close friend would.

I cant even explain you what your reassuring voice has meant to me.

Sunil and I thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for being so thoughtful.

We wish you all the very best.

We also decided to consult her for our family planning and it was one of the best decisions we had made. She helped us through our entire first pregnancy and helped us deliver a safe baby through a normal, healthy and safe method of delivery (NVD).  

We are encouraged and are happy to have Dr. Nagaveni as our go to doctor not just because of the methods she follows but also because she is friendly and is at arms reach as much as she could.  It is a rare find to have health care providers who ease patients and help them navigate through the problems with less stress.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Child Birth Education,Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"This was our second pregnancy when we started seeing Dr.Nagaveni and the content below is purely based on our experience. This might get a bit long but I'm sure it would be useful and comforting for couples planning for their big moment.

I will start with our first delivery experience in our home town far away from Bangalore 6 years ago. Unfortunately, we didn't had a good experience with the gynaecologist we consulted during that pregnancy and my wife also developed some complication at the delivery time, thankful to gods to help us sail through those times. So she was a lot apprehensive about reaching out to a female gynaecologist again (just one of those few biases you make up in your mind.) PS: Our 6 yr-old son is absolutely fit and healthy, and has waited eagerly along with us to welcome his younger sibling.

So it took me some to convince her to visit Dr.Nagaveni based on the reviews on practo and owing to proximity to the Ovum Kothanur clinic. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that my wife was floored with her first interaction and returned home all happy and optimistic. Dr. Nagaveni was all ears to all my wife's questions and in fact when we both went together explained to us in great detail about all the medical procedures and terms which we had learnt over web or were just curious about.

Due to a certain clinical reason, we were also asked to refer to a Haematologist, and the best part is doctor suggested us where we could get the tests done at a lower price. To be honest, she is the first doctor we have met who showed genuine concern towards underlying cost of different tests or consultations. And suggested for a better and economical service if available, whenever asked. Kudos to her.

Cut to 17th August, we were blessed with a healthy baby and due to her timely precautions and alertness we never had to went through the complications we underwent during the first pregnancy. Please note that clinically there were ~10-15% chances of recurrence of the same complication in second pregnancy. She was always there to morally uplift us and gave us a clear understanding of issues at hand whenever we had some doubt.

Last but not the least, our whole family would like to thank Dr.Nagaveni from the bottom of our hearts to be there when we needed someone we can trust on. And thus, we would strongly recommend Dr.Nagaveni to anyone who is planning or already planned for pregnancy. It's a long physical and emotional journey where you need a strong mentor to sail you through. Thank you ma'm once again!

I had two missed abortions for the 2 consecutive years which really made me and my family  stressed out and dejected. Due to relocation we had to move to Hennur and that’s when we got to know about Dr Nagaveni from our network in the area. She was very highly rated by everyone. Hence it was no brainer to start consulting with her. 

Considering our history we were quite in a low phase of our lives.  However post our first interaction with Dr. we felt a sense of calm and came out with a positive frame of mind.  She started our treatment from scratch and explained each and every detail of the course of treatment she is considering for us. This gave us lot of clarity and kept us quite positive and hopeful. In last 1 year we have had regular follow ups with her and each time it was such a pleasure talking to her.  Also , she remained connected on WhatsApp throughout the journey and always made sure that she replies to all my small queries I used to get. The pregnancy journey brings myriad of questions and Dr was there to answer them all . That itself was a big relief and helped me managing the stress. 

From our 1 year journey we got to understand that her expertise in the field is second to none. She seems very passionate and committed to her work and her work ethic is of the highest order . We always felt that we were in our right hands for our treatment and had full faith in Dr. throughout the journey.  I can go on and continue writing so many nice things about her and that still won’t do justice. However if I have to single out 1 thing then I would say - The best part about her is the way she patiently listened to all our questions ( I am sure many of them would be very silly.)  and answered them in great detail and still said- “Anything else , “Chandni ?” .

I was heavily bleeding one night and that was 7th week of my pregnancy,seeing that gush of blood ,I had lost all hopes.
I called my doctor and she asked us to visit hospital , we went there and doctor was available late night, she did the scan and with God's grace, my baby was fine and the bleeding was because of subchroinic hematoma.I had taken the medicines as prescribed and was on complete bed rest for a month or two.
Things might not have been the same ,had my doctor not been there that night,it's because of her availability and timely treatment ,everything went well.
I must say, she is the first doctor that I have come across who would answer all queries no matter what time of the day you call or message her, she would never miss to reply.

My doctor had always insisted me to try for normal delivery and this happened ,my labour went well which wouldn't have been possible without her support.

Doctor Nagaveni compassionate approach and positive words during that challenging time gave me the strength and reassurance I needed. Doctor’s genuine care and understanding made a significant difference in my emotional well-being.

The normal delivery of my baby boy was a beautiful and empowering experience, and I credit doctor’s exceptional skills as a doctor for that. Doctor’s calm demeanor and expertise throughout the process provided me with a sense of security and confidence. Doctor’s support during labor and delivery was unwavering, and I am grateful for Doctor’s presence during those precious moments.

Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation for Doctor’s  unwavering commitment, exceptional care, and dedication to my well-being throughout my pregnancy journey. Doctor’s expertise, professionalism, and kindness have made a lasting impact, and I am forever grateful for the role dr Nagaveni played in bringing my healthy baby boy into this world.

My pregnancy journey under Dr Nagaveni’s supervision has been extremely pleasant. We've approached the doctor at 9 weeks of my pregnancy based on the feedback posted in the Practo page after a very bad experience with another gynaecologist in our area.

Starting from the day 1 till delivery she was very friendly and advised me correctly with a diet plan for my Gestational Diabetics. She makes sure to explain every detail and at the end of each consultation, despite answering so many questions she would still ask with a smile ‘Anything else? ‘.

She always responded to WhatsApp messages and always picked our call even if it was early morning around 6AM when I got initial labour pain. She always encouraged and helped me to have a normal delivery and it happened at 36 weeks and during labour pain she motivated me a lot (Unforgettable memories in my lifetime) and which helped me to push more for normal delivery. After delivery I was treated and examined thoroughly, making sure everything was fine. My whole family is happy for Normal Delivery and we are very thankful to the Doctor.

I would highly recommend her for any related treatments/consultation. I am giving 5*** Rating for the service. Our experience with her has been amazing and all the reviews about her are 100% true. Keep up the good work Madam.

Thank you,

When I was in labor and in so much pain for 22 hours straight  I had given up and asked for C section but Dr Nagaveni was ready to wait for another 10 hours and asked me to try for normal delivery. God had other plans and after 21 hours of labor my baby’s heart beat started dipping and I was taken for an emergency C section. She never unnecessarily pushed for C section.
