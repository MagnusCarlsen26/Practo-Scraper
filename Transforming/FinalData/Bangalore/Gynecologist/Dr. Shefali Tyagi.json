Like any other parent, we were also extremely scared and were about to make some bad decisions during the delivery. Those decisions would have made Dr Shefali's work much easier and saved her a lot of time but despite that, she spent at least half an hour(multiple times) from her busy schedule to convince us not to make rash and short-term decisions but think about the baby and her long-term health. She even read out medical articles for us and we are so glad we listened to Dr Shefali. I can easily tell no other doctor would have done the same. To all the to-be-parents who are visiting Dr Shefali, I can tell you that she won't do anything that will not be the best for the baby even if it means she will have to put in extra efforts.",

I assumed that the doctor being knowledgeable was sufficient and that patients can\u2019t expect to be treated with respect or empathy. I had friends who had delivered under her care but since Sarjapur is far from my location, I didn\u2019t want to travel in such horrible roads, without knowing if the experience would be worth it.\n\nSomehow, out of anxiety regarding an uncomfortable birth experience, at 37th week, I decided to give Dr. Shefali Tyagi a try. It was an instant click. Her proficiency, knowledge and empathy was unparalleled. The fact that I thought doctors will always be unempathetic and irritated if they are busy, was thrown out of the window instantly. She was respectful of the birth plan I wished for. She explained me the pros and cons of my choice and what other alternative I had, which she could help me with. But once I made up my mind, she helped me in each step through it.\n\nI delivered under her on February first week and my baby is one week old now. My delivery experience and subsequent visits to her have been wonderful. Within a week, I feel almost fine. The doctor I had been in touch with for 9 months never gave me an email id to contact during emergencies. Even during visits, anything we asked was met with irritated replies. She suggested going to the hospital emergency for any doubt and that\u2019s what we did every time, for 9 months.\n\nWith Dr. Shefali Tyagi, from day 1 she had shared her email ID and has always responded to emergency/nonemergency doubt within less than an hour, even though I had just started to visit her. I wish I had this kind of support throughout my pregnancy.\n\nDuring the time I was at the hospital, she even treated my mother for a long-standing issue and my mother was happy with the experience too. Since I had willingly opted for a C-section, she also removed an ovarian cyst for me, which had been there for 15 years almost. \n\nWould absolutely recommend the doctor. Finally, I had an amazing birth experience, which I had absolutely lost hope for. I don\u2019t have a single thing to complain about.",

Usually people gets opinion/feedabck after meeting the doctor in person but my case is entirely different. Before I visited doctor (for the first time), I mentioned little history of my wife's health condition. I was very much surprised with her call and asking about my wife's current health conditions. \n\nMy wife was suffering with very high fever and full body ache and I could not get appointment earlier than monday evening. She checked this helath history and on friday itself she called me. I literally salute her for the professionalism and concern/care towards her patients. From friday to monday, she constantly checked all my emails, guided for what all tests needs to be done, checked all reports before I could meet and provided medication need to be started asap.\n\nThis gives me and my wife immense mental support and we didnt feel any more worries. The professional gesture of her doesn't ends here. She further informed me that I can visit on Monday morning itself since it would have been already four and half days by then. When we reached to Cloudnine Bellandur, we were schedule very next after the current patient she was consulting. Finally we met her, explained complete medical history, showed all test reports and she ensures that we feel staisfied by giving ample time for consultation.\n\nI was in favor of getting my wife admitted since \"Viral Fever\" was a scary thing in Pregnancy but she denied for same as it was not required and rest can be taken at home as well. Its very tough in this era to find medical professional who doesnt run behind money and rather entirely focus on well being and earliest recovery of patients helath.\n\nAfter acknowledging all these, I am still feeling short of words to express my respect towards her. \n\nAgain Thank You so very much Doctor for all your guidance, concern and care towards my wife's health.",

She is one of the Esteem doctors maybe in entire Medical Fraternity that forgot to do most basic test done during Pregnancy -  Urine test . In my first 20 weeks, she did not recommend Urine test even once.   When we went and asked her about it , she casually said that Urine test is not mandatory and she recommends only if required . I was later detected with a UTI infection ...had she recommended Urine test at each visit like all doctors in the world do , maybe there was a chance that UTI could have been detected earlier,\r\n\r\nShe might have done 100 successful deliveries , but if a doctor fails to  follow basis procedure , rule of thumb and most important test during Pregnancy, then i don't call it a mistake ....I call it 'NOT FIT FOR PRACTICE' .  Without Urine test, there is no way to get early indication of UTI infection, sugar or Protein .\r\n\r\nIn this case, it has been a case of Negligence - breach of a legal duty to take care.  A doctor vows certain duties to the patient who consults him for his illness.  A deficiency in his service results in negligence, which is termed as medical negligence.\r\n\r\nI suggest all to be mothers  consulting her to be careful and do your basic study and be cognizant of all test reqd at each month .\r\nWe go to doctors by confiding in them,  assuming that they will help us bring our bundle of joy into this world and this happens , it shakes your entire belief on such doctors.\r\n\r\nIt maybe 1 in 1000 mistake by Dr Shefali , but in no way can someone believe that a Gyno doctor can forget Urine test . I checked this with my known doctors across the world and  everyone had one word for it - BLUNDER.\r\n\r\nWe also requested the Dr and Motherhood to atleast render an apology but that also was too much to ask for  - In today's world , this is a big business and everyone talks about bottom line margins and profit.\r\n\r\nAs long as more and more women will keep on consulting her, Motherhood will keep her on board.\r\n\r\nI will also pursue the case Legally with her .",

I and my husband (my husband was in BLR because of his office location and I came there to visit him) were stuck in Bangalore during My 5 months of Pregnancy though my treatment was going-on in my Hometown..\n\nAt that time I was recommended to \u201csome other Doctor\u201d in Koramangala for my regular check ups , She was continuously doing Ultrasound to check foetus condition and informed Us that My baby has 2 round of umbilical cord in it\u2019s neck..also have given wrong information that my baby\u2019s growth is not appropriate..It was Corona days so we were not ready to switch to any other Doctor because of Corona precautions/ risky factor for pregnant women and we have Trusted Her without doubting.. We have also requested her for normal delivery and told about our situation..so on early days she was assuring for normal delivery but on the day my water broke, she was all the Sudden like \u201cwe can\u2019t go for Normal delivery, we need to take her to \nc-section because of the 2 rounds of the umbilical cord..We were verge of nowhere..\n( Marvel Multi-speciality Hospital / Dr. Mamatha Reddy) \n\nSo the Day My water broke by 4 o\u2019clock in the evening we reached to Cloudnine Bellanduru and we have asked for Doctor Shefali Tyagi.. I was under her treatment in 2018 for some minor gynaecological problem, when my profile was sent to her, she recognised me..But at that time she was not in duty so we have requested to admit me and I was immediately admitted there by the duty Doctor, then we have narrated all our situation and told we are especially looking for Normal delivery..Because of Lockdown and Corona None would be there with us only I and My husband had to take care of the baby..\nThen after Covid test I was shifted to labour room..\nBy the evening Dr.Shefali came and examined me and checked my reports and all..and I was kept in Labour for whole night and by the mid night I was given some medicine then next day by Morning Doctor again visited me..Then by afternoon at 1:29 PM my baby was born through \u201cnormal vaginal delivery (NVD)\u201d under Dr. Shefali Tyagi despite of having 2 rounds of Umbilical cord in Baby\u2019s neck..and my baby was born healthy with appropriate growth..\nI am very much grateful to Dr. Shefali Tyagi and her team for understanding our concern and supporting us at the time of crisis by nailing the normal delivery with Her excellent skills..\nThank you!! \n",

Her intuition on baby\u2019s health is excellent, she can simply say if baby is fine or not just by external examination. She doesn\u2019t believe in old wives tales, she is strictly professional and has medically proven answers to any doubts,She visited me after the delivery and kept checking The Stich also she herself and removed the water proof Stich .

My actual delivery was a breeze under her able expertise and I was elated that my wish came true when I delivered my baby normally in just a couple of hours. \nLooking back, i realize that she had done all the right things at the right time and stressed on the importance of walking and made my entire pregnancy journey such a sweet memory. She also did take me through the risks associated with a VBAC neverthless went with my decision, however only after sufficient assessment as to the success rate were done(cervical elastography tests). \nI am not quite sure if there are many doctors today who would really go the extra mile, while it might just be simple to do a c-section. I am eternally thankful to Doctor Shefali and her entire team for being such wonderful people that they were.",

First delivery we had in Rajasthan and that wasn't good experience at all. Its important to state that it was C-section delivery where doctor made T cut to take out baby. Because of that I personally lost my faith on doctors. So for second case we were somewhat stressed as well as careful with our selection. After reading reviews on Practo, we visited Shefali mam and asked lot of questions. She answered all the questions patiently. We were quite satisfied when we came out of the cabin. What I liked most about her is she never goes out of the context, complete focus on the patient and the area requiring consultation. There were some health issues with my wife which we overcome successfully with the consultation of Shefali mam. Even during Doctor's strike,she provided support when required and ensured safety for her patients. Its because of her that we could have safe Normal Delivery after 1st c-section. Its said that Doctors are placed equivalent to God. I would say that its because of Doctors like Shefali Mam. Thanks a tonn to you. I have no words to express my feeling but just hearty thanks to you. ",

Like any other parent, we were also extremely scared and were about to make some bad decisions during the delivery. Those decisions would have made Dr Shefali's work much easier and saved her a lot of time but despite that, she spent at least half an hour(multiple times) from her busy schedule to convince us not to make rash and short-term decisions but think about the baby and her long-term health. She even read out medical articles for us and we are so glad we listened to Dr Shefali. I can easily tell no other doctor would have done the same. To all the to-be-parents who are visiting Dr Shefali, I can tell you that she won't do anything that will not be the best for the baby even if it means she will have to put in extra efforts.",

I assumed that the doctor being knowledgeable was sufficient and that patients can\u2019t expect to be treated with respect or empathy. I had friends who had delivered under her care but since Sarjapur is far from my location, I didn\u2019t want to travel in such horrible roads, without knowing if the experience would be worth it.\n\nSomehow, out of anxiety regarding an uncomfortable birth experience, at 37th week, I decided to give Dr. Shefali Tyagi a try. It was an instant click. Her proficiency, knowledge and empathy was unparalleled. The fact that I thought doctors will always be unempathetic and irritated if they are busy, was thrown out of the window instantly. She was respectful of the birth plan I wished for. She explained me the pros and cons of my choice and what other alternative I had, which she could help me with. But once I made up my mind, she helped me in each step through it.\n\nI delivered under her on February first week and my baby is one week old now. My delivery experience and subsequent visits to her have been wonderful. Within a week, I feel almost fine. The doctor I had been in touch with for 9 months never gave me an email id to contact during emergencies. Even during visits, anything we asked was met with irritated replies. She suggested going to the hospital emergency for any doubt and that\u2019s what we did every time, for 9 months.\n\nWith Dr. Shefali Tyagi, from day 1 she had shared her email ID and has always responded to emergency/nonemergency doubt within less than an hour, even though I had just started to visit her. I wish I had this kind of support throughout my pregnancy.\n\nDuring the time I was at the hospital, she even treated my mother for a long-standing issue and my mother was happy with the experience too. Since I had willingly opted for a C-section, she also removed an ovarian cyst for me, which had been there for 15 years almost. \n\nWould absolutely recommend the doctor. Finally, I had an amazing birth experience, which I had absolutely lost hope for. I don\u2019t have a single thing to complain about.",

Usually people gets opinion/feedabck after meeting the doctor in person but my case is entirely different. Before I visited doctor (for the first time), I mentioned little history of my wife's health condition. I was very much surprised with her call and asking about my wife's current health conditions. \n\nMy wife was suffering with very high fever and full body ache and I could not get appointment earlier than monday evening. She checked this helath history and on friday itself she called me. I literally salute her for the professionalism and concern/care towards her patients. From friday to monday, she constantly checked all my emails, guided for what all tests needs to be done, checked all reports before I could meet and provided medication need to be started asap.\n\nThis gives me and my wife immense mental support and we didnt feel any more worries. The professional gesture of her doesn't ends here. She further informed me that I can visit on Monday morning itself since it would have been already four and half days by then. When we reached to Cloudnine Bellandur, we were schedule very next after the current patient she was consulting. Finally we met her, explained complete medical history, showed all test reports and she ensures that we feel staisfied by giving ample time for consultation.\n\nI was in favor of getting my wife admitted since \"Viral Fever\" was a scary thing in Pregnancy but she denied for same as it was not required and rest can be taken at home as well. Its very tough in this era to find medical professional who doesnt run behind money and rather entirely focus on well being and earliest recovery of patients helath.\n\nAfter acknowledging all these, I am still feeling short of words to express my respect towards her. \n\nAgain Thank You so very much Doctor for all your guidance, concern and care towards my wife's health.",

She is one of the Esteem doctors maybe in entire Medical Fraternity that forgot to do most basic test done during Pregnancy -  Urine test . In my first 20 weeks, she did not recommend Urine test even once.   When we went and asked her about it , she casually said that Urine test is not mandatory and she recommends only if required . I was later detected with a UTI infection ...had she recommended Urine test at each visit like all doctors in the world do , maybe there was a chance that UTI could have been detected earlier,\r\n\r\nShe might have done 100 successful deliveries , but if a doctor fails to  follow basis procedure , rule of thumb and most important test during Pregnancy, then i don't call it a mistake ....I call it 'NOT FIT FOR PRACTICE' .  Without Urine test, there is no way to get early indication of UTI infection, sugar or Protein .\r\n\r\nIn this case, it has been a case of Negligence - breach of a legal duty to take care.  A doctor vows certain duties to the patient who consults him for his illness.  A deficiency in his service results in negligence, which is termed as medical negligence.\r\n\r\nI suggest all to be mothers  consulting her to be careful and do your basic study and be cognizant of all test reqd at each month .\r\nWe go to doctors by confiding in them,  assuming that they will help us bring our bundle of joy into this world and this happens , it shakes your entire belief on such doctors.\r\n\r\nIt maybe 1 in 1000 mistake by Dr Shefali , but in no way can someone believe that a Gyno doctor can forget Urine test . I checked this with my known doctors across the world and  everyone had one word for it - BLUNDER.\r\n\r\nWe also requested the Dr and Motherhood to atleast render an apology but that also was too much to ask for  - In today's world , this is a big business and everyone talks about bottom line margins and profit.\r\n\r\nAs long as more and more women will keep on consulting her, Motherhood will keep her on board.\r\n\r\nI will also pursue the case Legally with her .",

I and my husband (my husband was in BLR because of his office location and I came there to visit him) were stuck in Bangalore during My 5 months of Pregnancy though my treatment was going-on in my Hometown..\n\nAt that time I was recommended to \u201csome other Doctor\u201d in Koramangala for my regular check ups , She was continuously doing Ultrasound to check foetus condition and informed Us that My baby has 2 round of umbilical cord in it\u2019s neck..also have given wrong information that my baby\u2019s growth is not appropriate..It was Corona days so we were not ready to switch to any other Doctor because of Corona precautions/ risky factor for pregnant women and we have Trusted Her without doubting.. We have also requested her for normal delivery and told about our situation..so on early days she was assuring for normal delivery but on the day my water broke, she was all the Sudden like \u201cwe can\u2019t go for Normal delivery, we need to take her to \nc-section because of the 2 rounds of the umbilical cord..We were verge of nowhere..\n( Marvel Multi-speciality Hospital / Dr. Mamatha Reddy) \n\nSo the Day My water broke by 4 o\u2019clock in the evening we reached to Cloudnine Bellanduru and we have asked for Doctor Shefali Tyagi.. I was under her treatment in 2018 for some minor gynaecological problem, when my profile was sent to her, she recognised me..But at that time she was not in duty so we have requested to admit me and I was immediately admitted there by the duty Doctor, then we have narrated all our situation and told we are especially looking for Normal delivery..Because of Lockdown and Corona None would be there with us only I and My husband had to take care of the baby..\nThen after Covid test I was shifted to labour room..\nBy the evening Dr.Shefali came and examined me and checked my reports and all..and I was kept in Labour for whole night and by the mid night I was given some medicine then next day by Morning Doctor again visited me..Then by afternoon at 1:29 PM my baby was born through \u201cnormal vaginal delivery (NVD)\u201d under Dr. Shefali Tyagi despite of having 2 rounds of Umbilical cord in Baby\u2019s neck..and my baby was born healthy with appropriate growth..\nI am very much grateful to Dr. Shefali Tyagi and her team for understanding our concern and supporting us at the time of crisis by nailing the normal delivery with Her excellent skills..\nThank you!! \n",

Her intuition on baby\u2019s health is excellent, she can simply say if baby is fine or not just by external examination. She doesn\u2019t believe in old wives tales, she is strictly professional and has medically proven answers to any doubts,She visited me after the delivery and kept checking The Stich also she herself and removed the water proof Stich .

My actual delivery was a breeze under her able expertise and I was elated that my wish came true when I delivered my baby normally in just a couple of hours. \nLooking back, i realize that she had done all the right things at the right time and stressed on the importance of walking and made my entire pregnancy journey such a sweet memory. She also did take me through the risks associated with a VBAC neverthless went with my decision, however only after sufficient assessment as to the success rate were done(cervical elastography tests). \nI am not quite sure if there are many doctors today who would really go the extra mile, while it might just be simple to do a c-section. I am eternally thankful to Doctor Shefali and her entire team for being such wonderful people that they were.",

First delivery we had in Rajasthan and that wasn't good experience at all. Its important to state that it was C-section delivery where doctor made T cut to take out baby. Because of that I personally lost my faith on doctors. So for second case we were somewhat stressed as well as careful with our selection. After reading reviews on Practo, we visited Shefali mam and asked lot of questions. She answered all the questions patiently. We were quite satisfied when we came out of the cabin. What I liked most about her is she never goes out of the context, complete focus on the patient and the area requiring consultation. There were some health issues with my wife which we overcome successfully with the consultation of Shefali mam. Even during Doctor's strike,she provided support when required and ensured safety for her patients. Its because of her that we could have safe Normal Delivery after 1st c-section. Its said that Doctors are placed equivalent to God. I would say that its because of Doctors like Shefali Mam. Thanks a tonn to you. I have no words to express my feeling but just hearty thanks to you. ",

I was regular with my diet , my walk and exercise as well as easily managing my office. But as soon as I entered my third trimester multiple problems started. First in GTT I got to know I'm in higher side of gestational diabetes then got diagnosed with obstetrics cholestasis and then got to know that umbilical cord is around my baby's neck because of that she was not moving much. Everyone told me that I will be having ceaseron delivery there is no chance of normal but in this whole world Shefali Ma'am came as only hope for me. She told me if you are mentally prepared for normal delivery then we can do normal delivery. And as she promised I delivered a healthy baby girl on 16th April via normal delivery. And I followed her instructions very strictly after my delivery and now we both mom and baby are doing good.",

No one believes that after a C-sec it\u2019s possible to have a normal delivery. But Dr.Shefali is one doctor who is true to her profession, and goes with the facts. My first delivery was a C-sec, but not once did she say that the second also would be a C-sec. She always said that if my body prepares for a normal delivery, we can definitely go with it. She understood the reason why my first delivery had to be a C-sec and took care of that factor with the help of scans and medicines and helped me with a normal delivery, for which I cannot thank her enough!",

During whole pregnancy doctor was very supportive. No unnecessary scans,tests or tablets. At times when doc was skeptical abt babies health she would immediately send us for free scans. Finally I delivered my baby through normal delivery. Doctor advised epidural n it was a blessing. Delivery was very smooth. I was able to experience vaginal birth without lot of pain. Although my baby had cord around it's neck n heart beat was decreasing, doc encourage me to push normally instead of using any external intervention like vaccum or forceps. I couldn't thank her less for everything n I am very grateful to her.\nI would totally recommend her to my frnds n family. ",

It was a high risk pregnancy due to the past history and we are so glad that we decided to go to her. She explains every bit very clearly and is very patient and friendly during the visits. She doesn't rush through, to chase you off to see more patients. She always asks you if we have anything at all in mind and makes sure it is clarified to the fullest. I cannot recommend her highly enough! *** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ********** ********\nI would recommend to watch her videos on youtube. They are very useful and informative. She is also the author of a book \"The Safe Journey to Motherhood\" which is one of the best reads for expecting parents(it's available on Amazon).\n\nThanks,\nImran & Nasira",

After the tests she cited hormonal imbalance as the cause,  put me on some tablets and sent me off. Needless to say there was hardly any improvement in my condition. I went and visited another gynaecologist recently who did a physical examination and detected a cervical polyp and recommended undergoing an operation to get the same removed. I'm so glad I never visited her again or I would be taking tablets for rest of my life for a condition I might never had. ",

Mostly she will prefer treatment which is highly required as per Patient health conditions and she will never try to mislead Patient by keeping them into another State of Mind. \n\nShe is Very cool and listen to all issues of Patient and guide her in a proper way without huge waste of Money. Normally we will see, many Doctors now a days will write huge list of Tests/Medicines and keep us in another state of mind to cash the Situation. But she will never try for that.\n\nThis is not only My Feedback, after listened from 4Guys I took my Wife to her treatment (at that time she had worked in another Hospital) and On First Day she gave me a Shock by \"When I asked her, that -Do I take my Wife for additional Tests? Her reply is ' I think you have more money, But Don't Waste it and Smiling..... '.  \n\nFinal word is She is a Good Friend for Patient more than a Doctor.",

At end of 5 months I was again totally normal as placenta moved up. I was very satisfied with her treatment and behaviour.  Though she talk less but always patiently answers patients query. At 38 weeks I was delivered a baby girl in normal delivery. All thanks to her. I highly recommend Dr. Shefali....",

Once she has responded, we used to be extremely relaxed. We never looked for a second opinion or looked the Internet.This being our first pregnancy, we used to mail her for the smallest questions and we would get an immediate reply. There was no stress.It is only due to Dr. Shefali and her expertise that we could prepare and get the normal delivery, she motivated my wife so much and handled a difficult case so well.

Dr Shefali was very friendly and provided clarification all the doubts my wife had.  During some of OPD appointments she had to rush for emergency cases, and I used to doubt whether our appointment will be postponed. Contrary she came back and finished appointment immediately post the emergency without even taking a break. Her passion and dedication to profession is remarkable. \n\nSecond delivery was normal, and I should really thank Dr Shefali since it was a post term and if it was some other doctor, it would have ended up in another C-section.
