And that we believe was one of the best decisions we made for the journey we were getting into. Right from the beginning of my Pregnancy till the end and even now post pregnancy, the experience with her has been very smooth and rewarding. She is very humble, friendly, and caring. The best thing about her is, she clears all our doubts patiently and explains everything in very detail (sometimes along with the diagrams :p) which definitely helps in calming our anxious pregnant brains and puts it to peace. She is all about staying fit and healthy through out pregnancy, encourages walking,  keeping weight in check, eating healthy, exercises, yoga, etc. She caters to all our needs and give us all the time we need. She from the beginning encouraged for normal delivery. I almost gave up and asked for C-Section during labour, she kept encouraging me and I had normal delivery. Also, towards the end of the pregnancy, she was available on call and whatsapp responding to all my questions and doubts.",

But after almost a year of knowing her, we have transitioned from readers to reviewers. \n\nDuring the early stages of our pregnancy journey, we tried a couple of OB-GYN consultants recommended by our friends. However, owing to reasons like long waiting period, distance etc. my wife and I decided to check for other options in and around Begur/Akshayanagar/Yellenahalli area. Luckily, we stumbled upon Dr. Gayathri\u2019s profile and we started consulting her in March 2021.\n\nShe comes across as someone who is very approachable and always has time and patience to address your questions. Despite meeting many patients, she very well understands that a patient has only one doctor and it is evident from the way she calmly explains every minute aspect. \n\nAs mentioned in many reviews, we have experienced and benefited from her home remedies. She always encouraged normal delivery and suggested exercises to improve chances of the same.\n\nIn our case, my wife had a condition called placenta previa. In such cases if the condition persists till the time of delivery, a normal delivery is not the most preferable option. However, Gayathri ma\u2019am kept encouraging us to do walking and fortunately during later stages of pregnancy, we no longer had that condition.\n\nDuring the delivery, we had \u2018meconium in womb\u2019 complication. Fortunately, Ma\u2019am had proactively identified it and delivered our baby in time.\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Gayathri and definitely recommend her for any OB/GYN concerns.\n",

Immediately, without second thought we contacted Dr. Gayathri B N for her opinion and she explained the condition and the future complications that could occur because of the condition in older women. She advised her to undergo laparoscopic BSO and hysterectomy surgery. Dr. Gayathri clearly explained the procedure in detail, clarified all our doubts and eased my mother into the procedure. The laparoscopic surgery was carried out by her and it went well. My mother had slight pain only on the night of the surgery and was fine from the very next day and even started walking with minimal support. Dr. Gayathri takes care of her patients very well and never denied help and support whenever we contacted her for any queries. She answers all the questions very politely and patiently. Unlike most of the doctors, she doesn\u2019t prescribe medicines unnecessarily and advises her patients dietary changes and natural remedies to address simple conditions. Post surgery care has been fantastic and my mother is recovering well. This is proof that my mother was in good hands. * *********** *** ******** ** ******** ** *** ** *** ** *** **** ************** ** *****  ",

Also, She made sure I don't roam around for blood tests or scans. she ensures her patients don't spend much until very much necessary. I opted for a planned C-Sec after my 36 weeks and she agreed to that. She was such a sweet heart. She made sure my delivery experience was very smooth.After my delivery also, I constantly followed her exercises to lose my mummy tummy and never had a C-section back pain.Meeting her was the best decision I took in my life and she changed my entire life today. we were happily holding our son for my 10th year Anniversary. My son is 15 months old now and touchwood, till date I never had any post pregnancy issues. Thank you so much Dr.Gayathri. I strongly recommend her for anyone who is longing for parenting.",

Happy times started as we welcomed a baby boy through a safe Normal Delivery!!!!!\nDuring the day of delivery, Dr. Gayathri madam showcased great commitment as always and made every possible way to stay with me, promising her to a safe end. \nI would like to say Dr. Gayathri madam always addresses an issue with a smile first. This relieves the patient of any sort of concerns. We traveled from Hyderabad to Bangalore during pregnancy and the best thing that happened is to meet Gayathri Madam. She always is patient-centric and very flexible with appointments. She is very accessible to patients outside of the consultation period. Your vision looking at a problem completely changes as you meet her.\nI would like to sincerely thank Dr. Gayathri madam from bottom of my heart for helping me throughout and helping to have a safe NORMAL DELIVERY.\nI strongly feel and recommend Dr. Gayathri B N madam as a great choice without any hesitation. Thanks a lot, madam.\n",

Then decided to consult one good doctor.\n\nIt was by our random pick and choose option to consult, Dr Gayathri BN  by reading through feedback posted on medical forums like practo, google reviews etc.\nBut our option didn't go in vain, post the consultation with Gayathri ma'm, now the result of happiness is with us. The same parent who gave up hopes of becoming parent is now proud parent to cute twins now. \n\nIf you follow the guidelines and treatments set up by the doctor for sure the result will be with you, despite all the roller coaster ride you are gonna face during your treatment tenure.\n\nDr. Gayathri B N is incredible. Not only she had taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with us at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!",

When my wife was at 24 weeks, her water broke, she had contractions, I had to rush her to Milann hospital. Dr. Gayathri handled this and she was at the hospital immediately after my wife got admitted. With all the medications and doctor\u2019s support, my wife got discharged in a week & was advised bed rest till the term. Dr. Gayathri was always available to us on phone - over the call as well as WhatsApp. Dr. Gayathri assisted us throughout without having us to visit the hospital. She even gave her personal Doppler and taught us to monitor the baby\u2019s heartbeat frequently. That helped us a lot. At 28 weeks my wife\u2019s water broke again and was rushed to hospital and was under observation for a night as per Dr. Gayathri\u2019s advice. Next day she had to get an emergency C-Section due to her severe contractions. Dr. Gayathri took a real quick call to operate and my wife delivered a boy baby. Though being a premature baby, now he is doing really well. My wife is doing well too and thanks to Dr. Gayathri for assisting us post pregnancy as well.\nWe hearty recommend Dr. Gayathri at any given point in time. ",

I had an issue with endometrial cyst which was quite complicated and due to which I was not able to conceive and also had horrible pain during periods. We initially had consulted few other doctors for the same but that did not help. Then we visited to Dr. Gayathri B N and found her extremely positive. She explains everything in detail and suggested some top notch tests, prescribed few medicines and asked us to try naturally and under her treatment, we conceived the very next cycle.\n\nMoreover,I also had cervix shortening issues in my 22nd week of pregnancy and risk of premature delivery but only with her guidance we completed 38 weeks. She answered all our queries with patience and was available over whatsapp and calls during emergency. Inspite of all the complications associated we were blessed with a little angel on 4th Jan. Special mention to Dr. Gayathri B N, she has been extremely helpful and motivated us in our pregnancy journey.",

She used to explain even minute stuff very patiently, and motivated me by boosting my confidence. Ma'am is polite, warm and very friendly.\n\nHer positive attitude is infectious. Ma'am is a normal delivery expert. From day1, she used to encourage exercising, walking and proper diet habits to increase the chances of normal delivery.  At times, even when I lose hope, she used to always encourage for normal delivery.\n\nShe is available 24/7 including late nights(we used to message her for emergencies and she used to reply each and every time).\n\nBy following the guidance, care and treatment plans suggested by gayathri ma'am, I could deliver a healthy baby via normal vaginal delivery inspite of complexities during pregnancy.\nShe has been a guiding light from day 1 of pregnancy till the delivery room. She was actually holding my hand and sharing tips to push in delivery room.\n\nAlso the tips and suggestions shared by ma'am post delivery were very very helpful.\n\nThank you so much ma\u2019am for all your support and guidance.

(Which is highly appreciated during pregnancy) \n- She is a normal delivery expert.  I was little doubtful whether to go for Normal delivery or C sec but she really motivated me to have a normal delivery. So if you want to have a normal delivery trust me she should be your go to person. \n- She prepared me from the beginning itself for normal delivery. She suggested me yoga and walk which worked out really well for me . \n- Not just this , infact she supported me till my labour room during my delivery. She literally holded my hand and motivated me to push . \nOverall I would rate my experience with her 10/10 . \nShe is very friendly and such a supportive Gyno with great positive attitude. Highly recommend for first time parents like us and others too who is looking for a Gyno . \nShe have been a saviour and a great motivator for me. Thanks mam for always being there during my pregnancy journey. ",

And that we believe was one of the best decisions we made for the journey we were getting into. Right from the beginning of my Pregnancy till the end and even now post pregnancy, the experience with her has been very smooth and rewarding. She is very humble, friendly, and caring. The best thing about her is, she clears all our doubts patiently and explains everything in very detail (sometimes along with the diagrams :p) which definitely helps in calming our anxious pregnant brains and puts it to peace. She is all about staying fit and healthy through out pregnancy, encourages walking,  keeping weight in check, eating healthy, exercises, yoga, etc. She caters to all our needs and give us all the time we need. She from the beginning encouraged for normal delivery. I almost gave up and asked for C-Section during labour, she kept encouraging me and I had normal delivery. Also, towards the end of the pregnancy, she was available on call and whatsapp responding to all my questions and doubts.",

But after almost a year of knowing her, we have transitioned from readers to reviewers. \n\nDuring the early stages of our pregnancy journey, we tried a couple of OB-GYN consultants recommended by our friends. However, owing to reasons like long waiting period, distance etc. my wife and I decided to check for other options in and around Begur/Akshayanagar/Yellenahalli area. Luckily, we stumbled upon Dr. Gayathri\u2019s profile and we started consulting her in March 2021.\n\nShe comes across as someone who is very approachable and always has time and patience to address your questions. Despite meeting many patients, she very well understands that a patient has only one doctor and it is evident from the way she calmly explains every minute aspect. \n\nAs mentioned in many reviews, we have experienced and benefited from her home remedies. She always encouraged normal delivery and suggested exercises to improve chances of the same.\n\nIn our case, my wife had a condition called placenta previa. In such cases if the condition persists till the time of delivery, a normal delivery is not the most preferable option. However, Gayathri ma\u2019am kept encouraging us to do walking and fortunately during later stages of pregnancy, we no longer had that condition.\n\nDuring the delivery, we had \u2018meconium in womb\u2019 complication. Fortunately, Ma\u2019am had proactively identified it and delivered our baby in time.\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Gayathri and definitely recommend her for any OB/GYN concerns.\n",

Immediately, without second thought we contacted Dr. Gayathri B N for her opinion and she explained the condition and the future complications that could occur because of the condition in older women. She advised her to undergo laparoscopic BSO and hysterectomy surgery. Dr. Gayathri clearly explained the procedure in detail, clarified all our doubts and eased my mother into the procedure. The laparoscopic surgery was carried out by her and it went well. My mother had slight pain only on the night of the surgery and was fine from the very next day and even started walking with minimal support. Dr. Gayathri takes care of her patients very well and never denied help and support whenever we contacted her for any queries. She answers all the questions very politely and patiently. Unlike most of the doctors, she doesn\u2019t prescribe medicines unnecessarily and advises her patients dietary changes and natural remedies to address simple conditions. Post surgery care has been fantastic and my mother is recovering well. This is proof that my mother was in good hands. * *********** *** ******** ** ******** ** *** ** *** ** *** **** ************** ** *****  ",

Also, She made sure I don't roam around for blood tests or scans. she ensures her patients don't spend much until very much necessary. I opted for a planned C-Sec after my 36 weeks and she agreed to that. She was such a sweet heart. She made sure my delivery experience was very smooth.After my delivery also, I constantly followed her exercises to lose my mummy tummy and never had a C-section back pain.Meeting her was the best decision I took in my life and she changed my entire life today. we were happily holding our son for my 10th year Anniversary. My son is 15 months old now and touchwood, till date I never had any post pregnancy issues. Thank you so much Dr.Gayathri. I strongly recommend her for anyone who is longing for parenting.",

Happy times started as we welcomed a baby boy through a safe Normal Delivery!!!!!\nDuring the day of delivery, Dr. Gayathri madam showcased great commitment as always and made every possible way to stay with me, promising her to a safe end. \nI would like to say Dr. Gayathri madam always addresses an issue with a smile first. This relieves the patient of any sort of concerns. We traveled from Hyderabad to Bangalore during pregnancy and the best thing that happened is to meet Gayathri Madam. She always is patient-centric and very flexible with appointments. She is very accessible to patients outside of the consultation period. Your vision looking at a problem completely changes as you meet her.\nI would like to sincerely thank Dr. Gayathri madam from bottom of my heart for helping me throughout and helping to have a safe NORMAL DELIVERY.\nI strongly feel and recommend Dr. Gayathri B N madam as a great choice without any hesitation. Thanks a lot, madam.\n",

Not only she had taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with us at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!",

When my wife was at 24 weeks, her water broke, she had contractions, I had to rush her to Milann hospital. Dr. Gayathri handled this and she was at the hospital immediately after my wife got admitted. With all the medications and doctor\u2019s support, my wife got discharged in a week & was advised bed rest till the term. Dr. Gayathri was always available to us on phone - over the call as well as WhatsApp. Dr. Gayathri assisted us throughout without having us to visit the hospital. She even gave her personal Doppler and taught us to monitor the baby\u2019s heartbeat frequently. That helped us a lot. At 28 weeks my wife\u2019s water broke again and was rushed to hospital and was under observation for a night as per Dr. Gayathri\u2019s advice. Next day she had to get an emergency C-Section due to her severe contractions. Dr. Gayathri took a real quick call to operate and my wife delivered a boy baby. Though being a premature baby, now he is doing really well. My wife is doing well too and thanks to Dr. Gayathri for assisting us post pregnancy as well.\nWe hearty recommend Dr. Gayathri at any given point in time. ",

I had an issue with endometrial cyst which was quite complicated and due to which I was not able to conceive and also had horrible pain during periods. We initially had consulted few other doctors for the same but that did not help. Then we visited to Dr. Gayathri B N and found her extremely positive. She explains everything in detail and suggested some top notch tests, prescribed few medicines and asked us to try naturally and under her treatment, we conceived the very next cycle.\n\nMoreover,I also had cervix shortening issues in my 22nd week of pregnancy and risk of premature delivery but only with her guidance we completed 38 weeks. She answered all our queries with patience and was available over whatsapp and calls during emergency. Inspite of all the complications associated we were blessed with a little angel on 4th Jan. Special mention to Dr. Gayathri B N, she has been extremely helpful and motivated us in our pregnancy journey.",

She used to explain even minute stuff very patiently, and motivated me by boosting my confidence. Ma'am is polite, warm and very friendly.\n\nHer positive attitude is infectious. Ma'am is a normal delivery expert. From day1, she used to encourage exercising, walking and proper diet habits to increase the chances of normal delivery.  At times, even when I lose hope, she used to always encourage for normal delivery.\n\nShe is available 24/7 including late nights(we used to message her for emergencies and she used to reply each and every time).\n\nBy following the guidance, care and treatment plans suggested by gayathri ma'am, I could deliver a healthy baby via normal vaginal delivery inspite of complexities during pregnancy.\nShe has been a guiding light from day 1 of pregnancy till the delivery room. She was actually holding my hand and sharing tips to push in delivery room.\n\nAlso the tips and suggestions shared by ma'am post delivery were very very helpful.\n\nThank you so much ma\u2019am for all your support and guidance. Definitely will recommend ma'am for friends and family.",

(Which is highly appreciated during pregnancy) \n- She is a normal delivery expert.  I was little doubtful whether to go for Normal delivery or C sec but she really motivated me to have a normal delivery. So if you want to have a normal delivery trust me she should be your go to person. \n- She prepared me from the beginning itself for normal delivery. She suggested me yoga and walk which worked out really well for me . \n- Not just this , infact she supported me till my labour room during my delivery. She literally holded my hand and motivated me to push . \nOverall I would rate my experience with her 10/10 . \nShe is very friendly and such a supportive Gyno with great positive attitude. Highly recommend for first time parents like us and others too who is looking for a Gyno . \nShe have been a saviour and a great motivator for me. Thanks mam for always being there during my pregnancy journey. ",

From Day 1 she gave us confidence. Throughout the pregnancy she kept on motivating us for normal delivery. Always advised natural remedies like walking for stress relief and back pain, jeera water for gastric issues, etc. She remembered my wives medical history and kept on monitoring her health, like BP, diabetes. She prescribed medicines and scans as and when needed. \nShe gave us her phone number and always responded to our calls and messages.\nWe had a lot of questions, but still she patiently listened and answered all of them one by one. At times, consultation time used to be more than 15 mins.\nWe were very satisfied with her. \nUnfortunately, my wife had to go for C-Section delivery due to some complications, but the doctor waiting till the last moment for normal delivery.\nI would also like to mention that we never faced issues like appointment getting cancelled or waiting too much for an appointment.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Gayathri to all.\n\n",

My wife had miscarried during the 7th month of previous pregnancy due to high BP issues and since then had developed hypertension. She inquired into minute details, understood our problem very well and explained the options available to us in a very friendly manner. She continued this at every stage of pregnancy, taking us into confidence about every decision she took. Under her friendly guidance and expertise my wife delivered a healthy baby boy on 4th July 2020, despite being a high risk case. From being a great doctor she became our strength and saw us through this ordeal. Today we are proud parents of a 5 day old Arush. Thank you once again for everything Doctor and hope that many more to be parents benefit from your wisdom and ability.",

She helped me to overcome all the downs of my pregnancy as i had thyroid, gestational diabetes, short cervix and low heemoglobin but still i could deliver a healthy baby via normal vaginal delivery because of her support and understanding. She took care of my each and every problem and ensured normal delivery even after my poor efforts in delivery room. At one point of my labor when i was not able to bear the pain of contractions and i wanted to have cesarean, she motivated me and my husband to have normal delivery as she knew we always wanted our baby via normal delivery. She is very polite, listens to your problem and gives you right advise.\n\nThank you so much ma\u2019am for all your support and guidance.",

She was very concerned as I was Anemic and took good care of this issue and made sure that things would go fine till my delivery. She has lots of patience to listen and to answer all our queries. She encouraged me for normal delivery from day one by suggesting me to stay active through out my pregnancy by going for walks and to do Yoga. She also ensured that I eat the right kind of food and gained the required weight for pregnancy. She was always available on phone for any of my urgent queries or problems. In spite of my poor maternal efforts, she made sure that I had a normal delivery as promised. I highly recommend her for any one who is looking for a good, supportive and motivating Gyno in Rainbow Hospital Bannerghatta Road. Thank you Dr. Gayathri for taking care of all my problems and for always being there for me.",

For couple of tests the sugars were normal yet the doctor insisted on getting tested again. The sugars were normal for most of the day however sporadic spike were observed. During 7th month of pregnancy my wife experienced pangs of backache. Doctor diagnosed it as probable infections in the body at the same time administered steroids for faster growth of the baby. The backache subsided once urinary infection was detected and diagnosed. She delivered to a healthy baby boy in 9th month of her pregnancy. Doctor handled the timing, COVID tests etc during the delivery very well. I strongly recommend Dr. Gayathri for women looking for a gynaecologist.",

After that we didn't even considered for any 2nd opinion. We had continued visiting her through the whole time till our baby was delivered. She was really very patient & listened to all the issues which we had. Also very helpful & humble in providing explanations & resolution to each query we had. Due to an emergency during the last time in the pregnancy, we had to opt for Cesarean, otherwise from start Doctor suggested for normal delivery only. Our whole experience with Doctor was awesome & would definitely recommend her to others as well. In last, we just want to thank Doctor Gayathri for everything she has done for us. Thanks a lot Doc.",

We were fortunate to discover Spectra clinic in Akshay nagar and in our first appointment with Dr Gayatri we had a sigh of relief! She is very patient and a great listener, ensures all problems are heard and discussed in length.My wife's pregnancy was bit complicated and to make it worse we were facing challenges during lockdown, Especially considering my wife was diagnosed with ovarian cyst. Those were most difficult times for us, but Dr.Gayatri has been very kind to us, she has been guiding us sensibly which helped us deal with all uncertainties! Today we are happy parents of two with little one beaming with cute smile! Thanks for everything Mam! We are forever grateful to you!Needless to say I strongly recommend Dr.Gayatri.",

She was referred by one of our friends. \n\nThis was my second pregnancy, we had to terminate our first baby due to the baby's heart anomaly. We were super conscious, worried, and tensed from the beginning for this pregnancy due to the past history. \n\nFrom day one we met Dr Gayatri, we felt like we came to the right person. One of the main reasons is how well she cared for me and answered all our questions. The connection between patients and doctors should be in this way I would say. \n\nAnother plus point about Dr Gayatri is she is available whenever you need her, we could just send her a message in WhatsApp any doubts or health related issues, she was always there to help. \n\nWe wanted to have a normal delivery and Dr Gayatri also helped us to achieve it. She suggested proper exercise , food etc., and finally with her support we got our little baby girl on 26 July 2022. Happiest day of our life. \n\nMe and my husband want to thank you Dr for all your support. Thank you!!",

I am personally very happy meeting her as I can frankly discuss any issues and get a very satisfying and scientific explanation around the cause, impact, cure and prevention of the issue. Dr. Gayathri is very approachable, patient not only in listening to the problem but also with her treatment approach. I have never experienced a long list of tests and unnecessary medication prescribed to me for any problem. \n\nAll her treatment plans have worked for issues around menstruation, urinary track infections and now very recently got some advice on preparing for menopause and what to expect.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Gayathri who goes beyond just treating an ailment but provides good advice on how to ensure issues don\u2019t repeat. Good advice to middle aged working women on how important it is to cultivate a lifestyle that prioritises health. Thank you Dr. Gayathri. \n\n",

After visiting her at Rainbow children's hospital we dint look for a second opinion. Later on we consulted her at spectra diagnostics. She has lots of patience to listen to all your problems and suggest the treatment only as required. We had a c section in our first pregnancy, hence we had to go for a c section this time as well. As my wife was anemic we were too concerned. But doctor took good care of her and made sure that things would go fine. She was always available on phone for any queries. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a gynaec without any second thought. Thanks a lot doctor for all your support and guidance throughout. Our baby is now 19days and we are super happy.",

So helpful and caring till the discharge as well as follow up. \nHistory started from getting irregular periods after my wedding, henceforth I missed my safe period and got conceived. Me and my husband were definitely not ready to carry it on. I found Dr. Gayatri at a clinic near my stay and consulted her. She was so kind and understood my problem well and helped me to come out of it without any complications. She is also conserned about the amount that we need to spend on the procedures. She always tried to reduce our expenses. Am so thankful that she made it happen with reasonable amount spent at hospital for the procedure. ",
