She is very busy as deputed as HOD  in Columbia Asia  because  of that to connect her over phone is very tough, first you need to call hospital, they will connect you to her if required.\n\n2. I suggest her name for consultation but not for delivery as she is too busy and cant give too much time to try for normal delivery .\nAs every girl is little scared of labour pain and want to opt C - section as painless option, Doctor tries to convince the pateint once or twice for normal else agreed for C-section.\n\n3. She won't prefer Saturday and Sunday for deliveries.",

I cannot say enough wonderful things about her. ***** ** **** * ***** ***** * ********* ****** *** ******** All I can say is I was so lucky to have found her. I only regret for not having seen or met her much before , I got to know about this amazing doctor through a friend of mine and I will strongly recommend all those with gynaec issues to meet Dr.Beena without any second thought or opinion. She will find a solution for you, a permanent solution. I can guarantee on that.  She never made me feel uncomfortable or bad for asking so many questions. Each time I see her, she has a smile on her face, no matter how big or complicated your problem is, she will make you feel at ease and give you the perfect treatment. I have always walked out from the clinic with great peace and contentment, thats how she makes you feel.  She is a best gyne I ever experienced. Before meeting Dr.Beena, I have consulted with many other gyne who are just professional with their patients. However, Dr. Beena is out of the world I would say. **** *** ***** Hats off to you Doctor... I would once  again recommend everyone to consult doctor Beena and get best advice all the time. God Bless you Doctor...",

I had to consult with Dr Beena as my previous consulting gynecologist left the hospital. Dr Beena is very brisk and curt and none of our sessions lasted more than 5 mins. Any follow up questions is given a standard response. At the time of birth, I did not have a say as to the type of birth. Worst still we did not receive any prior information about what a c-section entails. I had to do all my research on google. And after delivery too I had to google everything. I stopped visiting after the delivery however, unfortunately I developed infection at the site of sutures and had high fever. My wound opened up again. It took months of going to the hospital to get it dressed till it finally healed. \nThat was very taxing especially if you have a newborn to look after and you are running on minimal sleep. \nWe plan to have just one child. And I feel cheated that my only experience of pregnancy has not been a very happy one. \n\n",

I suggest her name for consultation but not for delivery as she is too busy and cant give too much time to try for normal delivery .\nAs every girl is little scared of labour pain and want to opt C - section as painless option, Doctor tries to convince the pateint once or twice for normal else agreed for C-section.\n\n3.

She will find a solution for you, a permanent solution. I can guarantee on that.  She never made me feel uncomfortable or bad for asking so many questions. Each time I see her, she has a smile on her face, no matter how big or complicated your problem is, she will make you feel at ease and give you the perfect treatment. I have always walked out from the clinic with great peace and contentment, thats how she makes you feel.  She is a best gyne I ever experienced. Before meeting Dr.Beena, I have consulted with many other gyne who are just professional with their patients. However, Dr. Beena is out of the world I would say. **** *** ***** Hats off to you Doctor... I would once  again recommend everyone to consult doctor Beena and get best advice all the time.

I had to consult with Dr Beena as my previous consulting gynecologist left the hospital. Dr Beena is very brisk and curt and none of our sessions lasted more than 5 mins. Any follow up questions is given a standard response. At the time of birth, I did not have a say as to the type of birth. Worst still we did not receive any prior information about what a c-section entails. I had to do all my research on google. And after delivery too I had to google everything. I stopped visiting after the delivery however, unfortunately I developed infection at the site of sutures and had high fever. My wound opened up again. It took months of going to the hospital to get it dressed till it finally healed. \nThat was very taxing especially if you have a newborn to look after and you are running on minimal sleep. \nWe plan to have just one child. And I feel cheated that my only experience of pregnancy has not been a very happy one. \n\n",
