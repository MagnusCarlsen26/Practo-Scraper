Later I went through laparoscopic surgery as during my HSG test my both tubes came as blocked. So another doctor suggested to go through surgery and they mentioned one tube is blocked and one is open but hydrosaplnix. Later we visited Dr. B Mallikarjun Keerthi and seeing the reports he practically suggested to go for IVF as chances of naturally conceive is less due to hydrosaplnix tube. So we went for IVF treatment and he explained the process clearly before starting the process. He was very friendly and practically explaining the expected results. After 1st IVF cycle, I got conceived and it was successful. Got the good news after waiting for more than 2 years. ",

Anyways we went ahead and gave a try.\nDr. Kirti style of treatment is very unique, perfect and in systematic way. He addresses problems of both male and female and gives treatment accordingly. He writes each every aspect in the patient history book.\nHe has loads of patience and experience hich is more important as every husband and wife would like to become a parent. He tells us the key reasons why we are not able to conceive and convinces with very very cool head. Like other doctors and hospitals, he won't put under medication unnecessarily and give extra dosage. \nHe understands situation both professionally and personally. He is very friendly and always available irrespective of time. \n\nOur first treatment of IUI was very much successful and we are now having 7months kid. The moment she conceived literally we had tears. \nDr. Kirthi was there with us during toughest times.\n\nIf you have fertility problems then I suggest Dr. Kirti. Highly recommended",

Later I went through laparoscopic surgery as during my HSG test my both tubes came as blocked. So another doctor suggested to go through surgery and they mentioned one tube is blocked and one is open but hydrosaplnix. Later we visited Dr. B Mallikarjun Keerthi and seeing the reports he practically suggested to go for IVF as chances of naturally conceive is less due to hydrosaplnix tube. So we went for IVF treatment and he explained the process clearly before starting the process. He was very friendly and practically explaining the expected results. After 1st IVF cycle, I got conceived and it was successful. Got the good news after waiting for more than 2 years. ",

These were the key issues for conceiving .\nThrough my sister suggestion we had met Dr. Mallikarjun kirthi. Initially we thought how can we discuss with a male all these issues. Anyways we went ahead and gave a try.\nDr. Kirti style of treatment is very unique, perfect and in systematic way. He addresses problems of both male and female and gives treatment accordingly. He writes each every aspect in the patient history book.\nHe has loads of patience and experience hich is more important as every husband and wife would like to become a parent. He tells us the key reasons why we are not able to conceive and convinces with very very cool head. Like other doctors and hospitals, he won't put under medication unnecessarily and give extra dosage. \nHe understands situation both professionally and personally. He is very friendly and always available irrespective of time. \n\nOur first treatment of IUI was very much successful and we are now having 7months kid. The moment she conceived literally we had tears. \nDr. Kirthi was there with us during toughest times.\n\nIf you have fertility problems then I suggest Dr. Kirti. Highly recommended",
