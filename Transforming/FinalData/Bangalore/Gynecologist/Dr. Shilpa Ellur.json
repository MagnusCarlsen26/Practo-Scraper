These qualities are very essential for the type of patients who would reach out to her.\nPre-Pregnancy consultation. \nShilpa ma'am has been a pillar like support for us in the time of distress. We approached her after a biochemical pregnancy loss and unable to conceive again. She explained us the importance of staying stress free during the pregnancy journey and suggested very few medicines. She explained the situation very well and suggested IUI. IUI was also performed by her. Within a month of consulting her, I was pregnant. \nPregnancy consultation \nWe continued to visit ma'am for pregnancy checkup. Ma'am used to call us only when needed and she used to give preference to pregnant patients. She never suggested unnecessary scans ans medicines. Most of the minor issues were resolved mostly on phone. \nDuring pregnancy I was tested COVID + and ma'am also suggested necessary medication over phone and assured us that the baby is safe. She didn't charge me anything for these. Also she monitored baby and my health throughout pregnancy. \nDelivery\nDue to low amniotic fluid, I had to be rushed to emergency for c-section. Ma'am was there to ensure that baby and I were safe. She even ensured that breast milk is sufficient for the baby and latching position is apt. \n\nShilpa ma'am is doctor for my mother in law as well. She operated my mil for uterus removal and health was completely monitored by her. \nI strongly recommend ma'am for her expertise and attitude with which she treats patients. Like we have general physician, women especially need gynecologist esp like shilpa ma'am",

Fate was taking away people from us and we felt, like any other Indian that extending family is the only way we can come out of the pain and have a fruitful life ahead. We had our doubts when we decided to go to a fertility clinic like any of you have. Whether this is right decision, right place, where these clinics are trust worthy. But all those fear & worries left us since we met Dr.Shilpa Mam. In this era, you hardly see a genuine and caring doctor like Shilpa Mam who prescribes medicine ONLY if it's essential. Only due to mam's proper knowledge, experience and care, we are glad to tell you that, we are now proud parents of twin baby girls. We really don't know how to thank Mam for this!\nApart from what I mentioned above, one unique quality Mam have is, she is so positive person. Not only me, I could see that positive energy flowing to my wife every time we meet Mam. It was very much needed for us especially after a very unfortunate incident happened in our family prior to meeting mam. As you know, when we go through this phase, it's quite natural that we get nervous. Trust me, the day we met Shilpa Mam, a positive energy started flowing to our mind & soul. She eases our tension with kind motivating words & care. She even sacrificed her consulting fee(of course we will pay it soon) on the day when our babies surprised us by their decision to come out early. we owe our entire happiness to mam. \\n\\nYou can trust my words as not a marketing content but true facts to the fullest. Mam is more than sister & mother to us.",

When I met with her first time with full of tensed, Ma'am listened to me patiently and assured me that I'll be Mom soon. After meeting her we felt so relaxed and pretty confident that now we reached the right place. Under her guidance, medication and follow ups we went with the treatment. After a lots of struggle, finally I got my good news. Now we got a clear understanding on what and where we are failing, which she explained everything very clearly. A big Thanks to Dr. Shilpa for giving us a wonderful gift. Shilpa ma'am is a ray of hope for many couple like us. She is well experienced, very friendly, very caring and always smiling and like a Mom to us in advising right things to do. Shilpa ma'am is always available on WhatsApp and call for any kind of queries. We are always thankful to the entire Milan staff in making our dream come true. I would definitely recommend her for any fertility related issues.",

These qualities are very essential for the type of patients who would reach out to her.\nPre-Pregnancy consultation. \nShilpa ma'am has been a pillar like support for us in the time of distress. We approached her after a biochemical pregnancy loss and unable to conceive again. She explained us the importance of staying stress free during the pregnancy journey and suggested very few medicines. She explained the situation very well and suggested IUI. IUI was also performed by her. Within a month of consulting her, I was pregnant. \nPregnancy consultation \nWe continued to visit ma'am for pregnancy checkup. Ma'am used to call us only when needed and she used to give preference to pregnant patients. She never suggested unnecessary scans ans medicines. Most of the minor issues were resolved mostly on phone. \nDuring pregnancy I was tested COVID + and ma'am also suggested necessary medication over phone and assured us that the baby is safe. She didn't charge me anything for these. Also she monitored baby and my health throughout pregnancy. \nDelivery\nDue to low amniotic fluid, I had to be rushed to emergency for c-section. Ma'am was there to ensure that baby and I were safe. She even ensured that breast milk is sufficient for the baby and latching position is apt. \n\nShilpa ma'am is doctor for my mother in law as well. She operated my mil for uterus removal and health was completely monitored by her. \nI strongly recommend ma'am for her expertise and attitude with which she treats patients. Like we have general physician, women especially need gynecologist esp like shilpa ma'am",

Fate was taking away people from us and we felt, like any other Indian that extending family is the only way we can come out of the pain and have a fruitful life ahead. We had our doubts when we decided to go to a fertility clinic like any of you have. Whether this is right decision, right place, where these clinics are trust worthy. But all those fear & worries left us since we met Dr.Shilpa Mam. In this era, you hardly see a genuine and caring doctor like Shilpa Mam who prescribes medicine ONLY if it's essential. Only due to mam's proper knowledge, experience and care, we are glad to tell you that, we are now proud parents of twin baby girls. We really don't know how to thank Mam for this!\nApart from what I mentioned above, one unique quality Mam have is, she is so positive person. Not only me, I could see that positive energy flowing to my wife every time we meet Mam. It was very much needed for us especially after a very unfortunate incident happened in our family prior to meeting mam. As you know, when we go through this phase, it's quite natural that we get nervous. Trust me, the day we met Shilpa Mam, a positive energy started flowing to our mind & soul. She eases our tension with kind motivating words & care. She even sacrificed her consulting fee(of course we will pay it soon) on the day when our babies surprised us by their decision to come out early. we owe our entire happiness to mam. \\n\\nYou can trust my words as not a marketing content but true facts to the fullest. Mam is more than sister & mother to us.",

After meeting her we felt so relaxed and pretty confident that now we reached the right place. Under her guidance, medication and follow ups we went with the treatment. After a lots of struggle, finally I got my good news. Now we got a clear understanding on what and where we are failing, which she explained everything very clearly. A big Thanks to Dr. Shilpa for giving us a wonderful gift. Shilpa ma'am is a ray of hope for many couple like us. She is well experienced, very friendly, very caring and always smiling and like a Mom to us in advising right things to do. Shilpa ma'am is always available on WhatsApp and call for any kind of queries. We are always thankful to the entire Milan staff in making our dream come true. I would definitely recommend her for any fertility related issues.",

She always made herself available over phone for any concerns and replies as early as possible. I am feeling blessed to have her as my doctor. I highly recommend her for any gynic related treatments.@Dr Shilpa: Thank you so much for your support and guidance. ",

Last November,2019 we met her for the first time with primary infertility. She was polite and took time to explain us things and gave us moral support during my IVF procedures and my first IVF cycle was successful. I am enjoying my 3rd month pregnancy now. She always addressed our concerns politely at any time. Her experience and commendable knowledge  makes us feel that we are in safe hands.

I started consulting Dr Shilpa from my 1st trimester. I still remember the day when I visited first time Dr Shilpa for pregnancy confirmation.. I was very happy and satisfied with the way she consulted me. She is very patient and calm in her approach which will help anyone to deal with any kind of pregnancy related health issues. And most importantly, she never suggested unnecessary tests or checkup\u2019s, rather advise and encourage for home remedies..  During my 2nd trimester I was having pregnancy diabetes and I was really worried.. But, I trusted Doctor and she advised less tablets but more on food diet to control the diabetic... I really appreciate the way she treated and advised me over phone also whenever I needed.. Finally I am blessed with cute and healthy baby boy... Thanks to doctor Shilpa Ellure..",
