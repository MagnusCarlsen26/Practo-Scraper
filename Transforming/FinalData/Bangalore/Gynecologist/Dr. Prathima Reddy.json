We were expecting our first child and we went through the anxious moments in the last few weeks before delivery, as any expecting couple would. At such moments, Prathima Madam's words were soothing, her observations were steely and the occasional one liners were just perfect for us - nothing more, nothing less.\n\n10 PM, 28th Dec 2017: As \"D\" day was nearing, i knew one of the most important person and the \"to be\" most important person of my life is in the right hands. Everything was planned for the next morning - observations, precautions and attention to detail.\n\nThough, things changed dramatically over the next four hours, as any pregnancy at later stage can turn out to be. Dr Reddy was informed by the ever caring duty staff.\n\nIt was late in the night at about 2:15 AM, 29th Dec. A team of doctors led by Dr. Prathima was ready on a war footing. Most of them were awake attending to the live reports. They rushed to the hospital within no time. Among the commotion and anxiety, I knew it was a critical case but at the same time the best people were attending to my wife. Sometime, you know someone is taking care of you, as you would take care of yourself with all the available resources at your hand. \n\n6 Hours and 45 minutes later, right at the swiping in time in IT parlance, at 8:59:13 IST, we were blessed to have a healthy mother and child in our hand.\n\nIn this beautiful world, there are many people performing their duty to the best of their ability and who can put a hand on their heart and say, yes i did the best. Dr Reddy, for me, is one such soul! Ably supported by her staff :)\n\nBidyut",

I had consulted multiple doctors in the past, had a laparoscopic removal of a cyst a decade back at a different hospital, after which some doctors suggested hysterctomy, some suggested endoscopy, and all of whom suggested just painkillers for pain management. \nDr. Reddy is the first doctor who prescribed specific medication for addressing the endometriosis, with follow ups. She also specifically stated that surgery was unnecessary and not a first course of action. I felt reassured after speaking to her that I was in good hands and look forward to a resolution to my long-standing health issue over time. \nI'd similarly recommend Dr. Deepthi, who gathered my case history and prepared notes for Dr Reddy (as I was a new patient) before I consulted her, for her ability to ask questions sensitively and listen reassuringly - these skills make a ton of difference to diagnosis, whereas my experience elsewhere in recent times has been hurried conversations that didn't really try to get to the root of the problem and had me really concerned about the state of my health.\nAbout Fortis LaFemme - I was pleased that contrary to expectations of delay set by the operator when I called, I didn't have to wait long despite being a walk-in patient, likely because it was a week-day, mid-week, and in the evening. The hospital staff came across as courteous, competent, and professional, and the calm ambience inspired confidence.",

The first time she saw me for 2 minutes after a wait periodnofnlike 3 hours. She suggested a couple of tests. I was charged for the follow up because the reports for the tests she had suggested took a long time and secondly she was completely  booked so didnt have time. On the second visit a junior doc sees.me . Mind you this is after I paid for her appointment twice not for the person who saw me. And she conveniently suggests another test. Cannot allay my worries regarding the issues with which I had sought a consultation and writes me off another test and conveniently  said that Dr Prathima  was not there. Do you think I would seriously go there again to wile my time and resources to be greeted by a rude receptionist, be seen by someone I didnt pay for, not get my queries answered but just be given test after test and keep paying for even follow ups and not see the doc. **** *** *** **** * *********  ********** ** *** ***** *** ********** ********* ** ********* ******* Will never visit again even if this is the only place left.

Then later when we went back after 6 months by then I convinced natural only by doing some lifestyle changes no unnecessary tablets nothing. We were so happy and later with doctors guidelines we without any problem I had my delivery.  Her unique thing is she won't ask your option, she knows what to do and she will do as per her plan and that really works and anybody can just blindly trust her. I had some problem during delivery time but with her timely suggestions I was able to deliver without any problems.  And thank you for the staff of Fortis la femme as well.

We were expecting our first child and we went through the anxious moments in the last few weeks before delivery, as any expecting couple would. At such moments, Prathima Madam's words were soothing, her observations were steely and the occasional one liners were just perfect for us - nothing more, nothing less.\n\n10 PM, 28th Dec 2017: As \"D\" day was nearing, i knew one of the most important person and the \"to be\" most important person of my life is in the right hands. Everything was planned for the next morning - observations, precautions and attention to detail.\n\nThough, things changed dramatically over the next four hours, as any pregnancy at later stage can turn out to be. Dr Reddy was informed by the ever caring duty staff.\n\nIt was late in the night at about 2:15 AM, 29th Dec. A team of doctors led by Dr. Prathima was ready on a war footing. Most of them were awake attending to the live reports. They rushed to the hospital within no time. Among the commotion and anxiety, I knew it was a critical case but at the same time the best people were attending to my wife. Sometime, you know someone is taking care of you, as you would take care of yourself with all the available resources at your hand. \n\n6 Hours and 45 minutes later, right at the swiping in time in IT parlance, at 8:59:13 IST, we were blessed to have a healthy mother and child in our hand.\n\nIn this beautiful world, there are many people performing their duty to the best of their ability and who can put a hand on their heart and say, yes i did the best. Dr Reddy, for me, is one such soul! Ably supported by her staff :)\n\nBidyut",

I had consulted multiple doctors in the past, had a laparoscopic removal of a cyst a decade back at a different hospital, after which some doctors suggested hysterctomy, some suggested endoscopy, and all of whom suggested just painkillers for pain management. \nDr. Reddy is the first doctor who prescribed specific medication for addressing the endometriosis, with follow ups. She also specifically stated that surgery was unnecessary and not a first course of action. I felt reassured after speaking to her that I was in good hands and look forward to a resolution to my long-standing health issue over time. \nI'd similarly recommend Dr. Deepthi, who gathered my case history and prepared notes for Dr Reddy (as I was a new patient) before I consulted her, for her ability to ask questions sensitively and listen reassuringly - these skills make a ton of difference to diagnosis, whereas my experience elsewhere in recent times has been hurried conversations that didn't really try to get to the root of the problem and had me really concerned about the state of my health.\nAbout Fortis LaFemme - I was pleased that contrary to expectations of delay set by the operator when I called, I didn't have to wait long despite being a walk-in patient, likely because it was a week-day, mid-week, and in the evening. The hospital staff came across as courteous, competent, and professional, and the calm ambience inspired confidence.",

The first time she saw me for 2 minutes after a wait periodnofnlike 3 hours. She suggested a couple of tests. I was charged for the follow up because the reports for the tests she had suggested took a long time and secondly she was completely  booked so didnt have time. On the second visit a junior doc sees.me . Mind you this is after I paid for her appointment twice not for the person who saw me. And she conveniently suggests another test. Cannot allay my worries regarding the issues with which I had sought a consultation and writes me off another test and conveniently  said that Dr Prathima  was not there. Do you think I would seriously go there again to wile my time and resources to be greeted by a rude receptionist, be seen by someone I didnt pay for, not get my queries answered but just be given test after test and keep paying for even follow ups and not see the doc. **** *** *** **** * *********  ********** ** *** ***** *** ********** ********* ** ********* ******* Will never visit again even if this is the only place left.

Then later when we went back after 6 months by then I convinced natural only by doing some lifestyle changes no unnecessary tablets nothing. We were so happy and later with doctors guidelines we without any problem I had my delivery.  Her unique thing is she won't ask your option, she knows what to do and she will do as per her plan and that really works and anybody can just blindly trust her. I had some problem during delivery time but with her timely suggestions I was able to deliver without any problems.  And thank you for the staff of Fortis la femme as well.

If I have to put it in a single line, then I'd say that Dr. Reddy is a no-nonsense doctor/person, and she provides genuine directions to patients. She encourages the patients for normal delivery till the last moment if there's no complication. What amazed me the most is that she was constantly there physically or over phone from the moment I admitted for my delivery. Later I discovered that she does it for all her patients, which I find extraordinary. I have become a fan of her ever since I met her, not only because of her treatment, proper guidance etc., *** **** *** *** ********** her simplicity and her awe-inspiring personality.  Thanks. ",

She is very systematic in her approach and explains everything very clearly.We always came back with a positive feeling after interacting with her. Her attention to detail is impeccable. We heard from the nurses that she was constantly monitoring vitals and other parameters as late as 2 AM on the day prior to our baby's delivery. Susbequently she was at the hospital early in the morning for the delivery procedure. Such devotion is rare in this day and age. \n\nWe are ever indebted to Dr Reddy and hope that many others benefit from her expertise and skills. \n\nThank You Dr Prathima Reddy for all that you did for us. \n\n- Kapil, Anuja and Baby Joesph\n",

I feel so blessed that she is my doctor and can never thank my friend enough for referring me to her!\nThank you, Doctor Prathima!",

You can trust her judgement 100%! I am not a person who is easily impressed with someone but this woman is a wonder! Golden hands is what they call her and rightly so!! Some of the reasons I was this impressed was her quick decision making ability in the labor room and she does it with such ease and confidence, her wonderful team of nurses and how hard she works day and night.. this is to name a few!!! And to round it all up I almost gave up the last minute for a normal delivery but she did not give up and made sure I did it, and all I am is thankful and greatfull to this woman, hats off to you Doctor!! To all women out there looking for a doctor who they can trust with their baby and themselves, here you are lookno further!! ",

Recently my wife delivered an adorable girl baby, to everyone's surprise it was a normal delivery. Most of the people said my wife can't deliver normally. Never in dreams we thought my wife could do it. We are greatful forever to Dr. Pratima Reddy for all her support and guidance without which it wouldn't have been possible. We liked her commitment, hard work, passion and professionalism.  We can't thank enough for her service. Thank you doctor, god bless you!. Hands down you are the best. ",

She is very professional and gives opportunity for the body to heal naturally. Only when medication is absolutely necessary she prescribes them. She have great positive vibes. I always get charged with positiveness whenever i meet her(though it is very brief and mostly during my health related visit). A great thumbs up for her from my side. And i would suggest you all there to consult her for women related health issues.",

They gave us registration form and got the billing done, after 5-10 mins of their internal discussion they told us to meet Dr.niveditha instead of Dr Prathima saying niveditha is her assistant. When we insisted on meeting Dr.Prathima they finally agreed to make us meet the doctor, but we had to wait till 3.30 to meet her, in between we enquired multiple times about why so much waiting time, but they had no clue, they were just pointing to each other and just some how pass the time",
