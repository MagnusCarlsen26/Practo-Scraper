Our fist visit became the best visit as we were pretty impressed by the  friendliness and professionalism maam had. She did understand our condition and did listen to our whole lot of stories and various complications, and other issues with our previous miscarriages.\n\nAfter 2 miscarriages previously and other issues with my wife's uterus we had lost a hope of having a child, but after meeting Meenakshi maam her expertise, calmness and her way of handling things gave us a lot of confidence and trust which gave us a positive vibe of being parents.\n\nMeenakshi maam is very knowledgeable and the technique or methods she uses in her treatment are mindblowing and remarkable. The success stories what we experienced and heard about Maam are to a great extent and appreciable\n\nToday we are proud to be parents of a baby boy and the only reason for this is because of Maam, she is one of the best doctor whom we have ever seen through our entire life. Her dedication, support and knowledge has brought a success and praises which cant be explained.\n\nMaam did take a personal care of us and she was available to us 24/7 which no other doctors would do.  She has also helped us to overcome all the consequences  throughout our entire pregnancy journey. \n\nWords fall short to us and cant be explained. the support, affection, care, treatment which we got from Maam are never forgetable. We will always be thankful to Maam from bottom of our heart. I proudly with raised head say it was the best decision we made to consult Maam for our pregnancy journey and i would always ask or request people to consult maam for any pregnacy or fertility related issues and you will see a postive change, happiness and joy in ur life.\n\nOnce again thank you maam for what all you have done to us and our family. We will always be thankful to you and u will remain in our hearts forever.\n\nMay you have lots and lots of success and happiness  in your life as well as carrer.\n\nBest wishes\nMamatha Sharath",

Initially, I was unsure about continuing with the pregnancy, but she guided us about the disadvantages of late pregnancy in one's late 30s. Her advice convinced us, and we decided to proceed with the pregnancy. The first three months were a bit difficult for me, but Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi was always there to support and clear my doubts. She was very positive throughout my pregnancy and gave us many examples that motivated us. On January 22, 2024, I delivered a healthy baby girl. After delivery, I was experiencing a high fever, and I was unsure if I would be able to take care of my baby. But Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi treated me very well. Most importantly, she was always available on calls, emails, or messages. I would recommend Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi for pregnancy-related queries. It was the best experience I had.\n",

We had a pretty smooth ride of about 9-10 months. Every time our questions and confusions were taken care by her quite patiently, pure bliss to have her as our doctor. Quite satisfactory and impressive job done by her and her peers as well. My wife was able to have a normal delivery because of her guidance and encouragement both. We feel quite fortunate to have her on our side.  Thanks a lot ma'm.",

In between I had other issues like cold and everytime her medicines worked for me.She helped me with normal vaginal delivery.Entire Labour room staff was cooperative as well. I can't thank enough for all her efforts to get baby delivered normal.I also met her post pregnancy and she guided me well for quick recovery.

Over these past three years, my husband and I have navigated through immense challenges, including the heart-wrenching experience of a MTP with our first baby. Throughout this trying period, Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi stood by us, offering not only exceptional medical care but also invaluable emotional support.\n\nOn the joyous occasion of 15/11/2023, when our precious baby boy entered the world, my happiness transcended words. What made the moment even more special was hearing Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi remark, \"I remember you guys visited me for the very first time on a Saturday.\" This demonstrated the extraordinary bond she had cultivated with us over the years.\n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi for her unwavering support throughout this journey. Her compassionate care has been a guiding light, and I am truly grateful for the positive impact she has had on our lives.",

My 9 months pregnancy journey with Vijaya Meenakshi mam was very much satisfactory and she had never suggested for unwanted scans during my journey. She was always available whenever needed.\n\nI had some complications during my delivery but Dr. Vijaya Meenakshi mam gave us all the hopes during the delivery and treated me so well. She gave strength to my Husband, my Old Parents, my Mother-in-law. I have delivered a Baby Boy and Dr. Vijaya mam helped us with the normal delivery which was most needed for me due to personal issues.Thank you so much Vijaya mam and I would like to Thank Prithvi doctor as well who was with us during my delivery.\n\nI am grateful to you Vijaya mam, Thanks:)",

Frankly, our first visit itself was promising.\n\n\nShe is calm, polite , always smiling and positive. Her calm nature spreads a positive vibe. She is very patient , she always has answered all the queries we had and she cleared all our doubts throughout our visits. Her positive , honest and friendly approach is what made us choose her for our baby. Also she has provided her number for emergencies & she responded to all the msgs giving us solutions. \n\n\nWe are also very impressed by her pace of treatment, medication methods, and more important is her tailor made treatments.\n\nAll thanks to her we welcomed our baby last month.\n\nThank you doctor !!",

She is not only available in the hospital but also via mobile she helped us when we contacted her with our doubts during the pregnancy.\nShe advised to me to have all types of food in my diet and kept no restriction on the same, Of course, the food was supposed to be home cooked; mainly protein rich since it helps in the growth of baby weight. She is a very patient and humble doctor who will address all the queries in your mind automatically.  Most of her treatment is natural. She suggests lot of natural remedies to most of the complaints. She only prescribes medicines when it is absolutely necessary. She kept us informed on what to expect at every stage of the pregnancy. This helps us to be mentally and physically prepared. \nOverall I had a fabulous experience with my delivery with her.\nEven post pregnancy I have been consulting her for my issues and she helps to calm me down and provide me a great resolution.",

After we came out  of the doctor clinic we were fully satisfied with the treatment given, We were very happy that we had found a nice doctor for our second child.  In my personal experience , she was the FIRST DOCTOR to call us up the next day post treatment to check the health condition of my wife !!!!!!!  \nEven though ours was always a high risk pregnancy, she always gave the correct treatment and never made us anxious. Every visit we make, we come back happy and confident. \nVery punctual, and also apologizes to you in case she is late. Very calm in her explanation of the issue, listens to your complaints patiently *** ****** ***** *** **** ********** Very very humble, down to earth *** ************* ******* \n\nWe had to move to Chennai for pregnancy due to personal reasons, but the first 8 months of treatment we got from her showed her quality. \n\n\n\nThank You Doctor.\n\nVineetha/Lakshmi Narasimhan",

Dr. Vijay Meenakshi gave me the confidence I needed and the first visit I decided to chose her for my pregnancy. My entire pregnancy was smooth untill 33 weeks and unfortunately I had to go for an emergency C section due to sudden water breakage, Dr. Vijay Meenakshi handled the situation very well and ensured that she took right decision and I successfully gave birth to a girl baby. We (I and my husband) are forever greatful to the doctor for all the efforts, dedication and emotional support during the rough days we were going through when our baby was in NICU due to pre term delivery. I would highly recommend Dr. Vijay Meenakshi to everyone!!\nI can\u2019t thank you enough doctor. You\u2019re the best!! Wish you all the success for your career. ",

After troublesome first delivery , I was very much selective of the obgyn I had to go with during second pregnancy and delivery. I must say the Doctor very patiently listens to what we have to say and recommends only the required medicines/scans and will make us understand exactly what is expected from us for safe delivery . All the consultation phase was very comforting . I had gestational diabetes which terrified me as the numbers were too high . The kind of confidence , support and soothing words from the doctor are worth millions. Needless to say, delivery (mine was c section due to complications from early delivery ) was handled in the most appropriate way keeping in view of my health concerns . The complications I had before were taken into consideration and I don\u2019t face them in this delivery. Thanks to Doctor . A simple word with tons of emotions . I definitely STRONGLY recommend the doc from my experience . The perfect answer to a tensed and worried to-be-mom like me, to have all questions solved and all health concerns taken care of.",

I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and cholestatis during later part of pregnancy. Doctor helped in tackling these issues. During delivery day, her entire team has been very supportive. They encouraged and supported for vaginal delivery.  My pre and post delivery experience with her has been very smooth. I highly recommend her. ",

Being pregnant for the first time I did not even have much questions, she has always proactively shared bunch of knowledge that kept us calm during the small issues. Madam had even shared her mail Id so that we could reach her in case of any question or small queries (during emergency). There had been so many issues but she made everything so easy. She helped me for normal delivery, she encouraged me every time I wanted to give up. Madam had attended my delivery and I knew she will do the best and that I and my baby were in good hands. She is so cool and polite that it is very easy to approach her and share your problems. We can not thank her enough for making our journey so easy.",

She is good at analysing the concerns/issues raised by us and addressed them very smoothly.since my Day1 visit, I had been requesting mam for normal delivery and she encouraged and helped me for normal delivery. On the day of labour, mam had attended my delivery hence I was confident enough that I was in good hands and that made my delivery smooth and hassle free.
