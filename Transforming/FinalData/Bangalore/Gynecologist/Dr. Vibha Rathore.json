She treats her patients with such professionalism and compassion. So helpful and guiding in every way.In addition to being a fantastic doctor, she is also a kind, wonderful human being who is cheerful and easy to get along with. Her services are selfless. Fantastic treatment as always. She is a highly brilliant gynecologist who also possesses human values. Great advice; these days, it's rare to find doctors like that. Additionally, she personally follows up with patients by phone both during and after treatment\u2014a unusual trait in modern medicine. had a very secure and cozy feeling. With all of her advice, we are now fortunate to have a healthy baby. Hugs and best wishes to Dr. Vibha Rathore \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f",
