It was so emphathetic of her to encourage us to primarily try natural conception (which  certainly is not the case with other physicians, atleast with our experience of vast  and innumerable consultations elsewhere!).  With her frequent guidance and effective prescriptions, it proved to be miraculously possible.  When we had to take her intervention to finally make it happen, by  god's grace it was in maiden session alone! Now  we're blessed with bundle of joy, forever we'll be extremely greatful to Dr. Priyanka!\n ** ** *** **** *** ********* *** medical prowess that impresses one but also her kindness, emphathy,  and complete understanding of complex emotions that makes her a wonderful human being. \nAnd above all, we believe it is her divine and rejuvenating power that god has bestowed upon her, which she has dedicated to the service of humanity.\nWe strongly feel and encourage one and all to seek her advise for your needs, full of confidence and without inhibitions. You will realise you have made right choice.",

It was so emphathetic of her to encourage us to primarily try natural conception (which  certainly is not the case with other physicians, atleast with our experience of vast  and innumerable consultations elsewhere!).  With her frequent guidance and effective prescriptions, it proved to be miraculously possible.  When we had to take her intervention to finally make it happen, by  god's grace it was in maiden session alone! Now  we're blessed with bundle of joy, forever we'll be extremely greatful to Dr. Priyanka!\n ** ** *** **** *** ********* *** medical prowess that impresses one but also her kindness, emphathy,  and complete understanding of complex emotions that makes her a wonderful human being. \nAnd above all, we believe it is her divine and rejuvenating power that god has bestowed upon her, which she has dedicated to the service of humanity.\nWe strongly feel and encourage one and all to seek her advise for your needs, full of confidence and without inhibitions.
