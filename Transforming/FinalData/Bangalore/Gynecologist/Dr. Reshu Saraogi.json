After that I took a consultation for conceiving and conceived for the first time through IUI in 2017 and under his care I gave birth to my first child in January 2018.  During my first pregnancy I realized that there is no one in this world like Reshu ma'am.She is a wonderful doctor with human values.. ..She supports the patient a lot on emotional level.  Which is very important for a pregnant woman... I always feel a different connection with her... Maybe everyone can feel it because she is like that.. That's why when I again got pregnant...I was in Indore...I met many doctors in Indore but I was not comfortable with anyone and contacted Reshu ma'am and decided that I will go with Reshu ma'am only. I met her only once in January 2019 and I managed my pregnancy as per her advice through WhatsApp and phone.  And in August 2019 I traveled from Indore to Bengaluru and delivered my second baby safely under her care... If she had not been there I would not have been able to manage anything.. She is the angel of my life..Many times, I tried to write reviews about her but I couldn't.  .. Because I don't have words to describe her.. Truly she is amazing.. .. I always respect you and am grateful to you.. No one is like you... Love you\u2764 ma'am ...",

She is very soft spoken, yet she speaks to the point. Her medications and diagnostic tests are also very much to the point - not too less or not too much. Her clinic has walk in consultation early in the morning, which enables us to consult with her without taking leaves on working days. She's available and responsive on whatsapp chat for pregnancy related doubts.I had suffered from a missed miscarriage and chemical pregnancy loss last year and was totally heartbroken by it! When I conceived again, I consulted Dr Reshu. 1st trimester:Knowing my prior history, she took extreme care and monitored me and my baby very closely during the first trimester. I had internal bleeding issue, which got caught during her monitoring. She advised me bed rest until 5th month as the internal bleeding was not yet affecting the baby. It's indeed a blessing that I came across Dr Reshu, else this issue could have been missed or detected much later!2nd trimester:My bleeding issue got resolved but I got infected with covid via my husband. I got a panic attack about getting infected with covid from my hubby and got concerns about baby's health if I do get infected! Here Dr Reshu's composure, soothing voice and friendly tone - along with my complete faith on her - helped me sail through the entire covid infection. Physically the infection was very mild but emotional stress was much higher. Here Dr Reshu helped me calm down and handle my emotional stress, which was a major part of fighting the infection! This is very rare among doctors nowadays! I held on to her words whenever I felt panicky and fought the infection with more courage!At the end of covid, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Dr Reshu handled it very well and kept it under control with the right amount of tests, diet changes and medicines.3rd trimester:Since my placenta was anterior high, dr allowed me prenatal yoga. Baby's and my health were all fine so she didn't order unnecessary scans. However she's always available and responsive on whatsapp for doubts and queries as during the third trimester, symptoms can get confusing. I always kept Dr Reshu informed about anything which I felt was odd. Her responsiveness helped me keep myself sane and also avoided unnecessary trips to clinic for every small questions.Delivery: I had to be admitted to hospital in emergency as my amniotic fluid has started leaking. However, the labour and delivery went quite smoothly. Dr Reshu was constantly monitoring my status from on duty doctors, until she reached the hospital. She delivered my baby with her cheerful and energetic voice to give me extra energy to push as I was getting tired towards the end! She brought my beautiful baby boy in this world \ud83d\udc95 May God shower her with all the blessings, happiness and success in the world! ",

It was a precious pregnancy, and we visited 3 doctors before meeting her. In our first visit to Dr. Reshu, as soon as our conversation started , a sense of trust got instilled inside and we were extremely satisfied. She took extreme cognisance of my medical history and kept on tracking all medical reports with diligence. Unlike other doctors, she gave us ample time during our visits, ensured all the queries got answered and always provided reasons behind prescribed medicines. There were lots of instances where we felt, she has no interest in making moey from her patients by suggesting unnecessary scans/tests instead all her suggestions, medicines, scans , tests were backed by strong rationale. As the time passed , the TRUST we had on her was unbeatable, whatever she said, we just accepted without any second thought. She tried for my normal delivery till the last moment but due to some complications and to eliminate any underlying risk , she immediately took me for Cesarean. During my Cesarean, she kept talking to me, kept me calm and made it a cakewalk.\n\nShe guides you like a mentor, treats you like a family and these qualities make her an amazing doctor and a wonderful human being. The positive vibes from her would make her patient feel so safe and secure.\n\nAt last , just want to say, I strongly feel she is just like her name- and nothing can go wrong if you are under her treatment, that's my level of trust and confidence on her.\n\n*** **** *** **** ************** *** *** **** ****** * * **** **** **** ******* Highly recommended!!!!!\nThanks Mam!!",

I am a first time mom and I did not know any doctor personally in Bangalore, so when enquired I was recommended Dr. Reshu by a lot of my friends who previously have been her patients and my Uncle. I was skeptical about how things will be handled during the ongoing pandemic but I was impressed with the way Dr Reshu dealt with the whole process. She is kind and understanding, her approach towards dealing with patients is something that I really liked about her. She is gentle and supportive. Always available on call/msgs for any kind of doubts or questions. Pregnancy is a phase where in women deal with unknowns/uncertainty  everyday and it is important to have a doctor who understands your state of mind and i am grateful to Dr Reshu as I could just count on her for everything.\nFrom my birth experience I can tell that she is a doctor who is well prepared for every situation and is organised, quick. I was always given the options/choices for my delivery -may it be the hospital, the type of delivery etc and I never felt that she decided things for me and I was in total control of what I wanted as part of my birth plan.\n\nPost delivery contact/support- there are many occasions when I have contacted her on call/msgs post delivery and she has been available to hear me and help me out at the earliest she could.\n\nFrom my personal experience, I highly recommend her to anybody who is looking for a gynaec in Bangalore.",

We will try to call out both positives and negatives in terms of consulting this doctor, while trying to be objective and not being judgemental. \nPositives:\n1) As pointed out by many others here, we completely agree that Dr. Reshu is one of those few doctors who do not prescribe *********** tests and medicines to the patients and empty their pockets; she suggests only those medicines that are absolutely required\n2) She is very calm and composed all the time, and this calmness with composure can rub off to the patient*** *** ** ****** in minimal invasive surgeries which we got to experience positively during the LH surgery for my mom's uterus removal\n4) She is very practical and objective in her approach during treatment\n\nNegatives:\n** **** ************* ****** *** **** ************* * *** ***** ******** ** ********* **** *************** ********* *********** the doctor can be objective and engage in only small-talk while treating the patient; but for issues like PCOS and Early Pregnancy Loss - Miscarriage in 1st trimester (which we are suffering from), where there is a lot of psychological and emotional trauma involved, you would expect the gynaec to not just focus on the medical treatment but also provide some counseling to patient who would be going thru lot of guilt and other emotional issues etc. due to miscarriage. A case in point being - we visited her 2 days ago with positive pregnancy test result and 35 HCG level, she asked us to do HCG test in 48 hrs and indicated that the levels are low for 5th week.. and when we told her today that she had heavy bleeding along with mucous fluids and all that stuff in the last 2 days and the HCG has dropped to 9, she told us **** ************ that this proves the pregnancy didn't work and she just asked us to wait for 1 month and resume planning till 3 months - she didn't even bother to ask how my wife's mental state is, whether she is feeling any guilt or negative concerns about conceiving in the future, she didn't bother to explain the biological process of what actually happened, what should have happened, and what should we do to improve our chances, ******* **** ** *** ******* ****** **** **** * all she said was that this could be anything, it is very normal, keep planning for another 3 months - btw, we have been planning since last 1.5-2 years and have been consulting her regularly regarding this; I also observed that she doesn't bother to go through previous reports in the file we gave to her, to check the history on TSH, Hb1Ac, Thyroid etc. She was asking us for those values, and when we couldn't remember, she asked us to have those tests again;\n2) She always seems to be in a rush to send the patient away from the room, ** ** *** ******** ** ** ***** ** **** ******** ** ******** ** *** **** ******* **** ****** **** ***** **** **** **** ******* **** ***** ** ** causing stuff like not taking time to talk to patient about her emotional health, *** ******** *** *** ********* ****** ** ****** ******* not providing any counseling whatsoever, *** ***** ******* *** ******* ******* ** ****** ******** ******** *************** During the numerous visits we have made during last 3 years, it is my observation that her average consulting time per patient is hardly 3-4 minutes!\n3) *** ************* ***** ** ****** ******* *** ************* **** *** **** ****** ** ********** **** ** *** **** ***** *** ***** ** ******** *** ****** **** **** ******* **** *** *** *** ************ ******* ** ****** ** ********* **** ** **** *** ******* **** *********** ** ** **** ** ******* ********** ** ******* ****** *** ********* ***** **** ********* ******* ***** She is also not very approachable in general; ** **** ** ** ********** ** *** **** ******** ****** *** ** **** ************ ****** ** ******* ****** she responds to your intense WhatsApp msgs with blunt one-liners, very similar to the face-to-face exchange.\nThis leads to an absolute lack of warmth or compassion or comfort feeling between the patient and her; with very mechanical and incomplete conversations.\n\n***** ** ** ******* **** *** ***** ** * **** ******* ************ **** ***** ****** *********** ** *** ******* ****** *** *** ***** ****** ********** ** *** ********** ******* ***** * **** ****** *** * ***** ******* *** ** * **** ****** *** ********** *** * ***** ******* *** we are not recommending her primarily due to this reason - her not being there for us when we needed",

However, we realized we need to have better consultation and approached Dr Reshu for online consultation while we were there.\n\nDr Reshu is well known in our circle with our family and friends and we knew from the starting we were in good hands. The online consultation and the assurance ,especially when the first trimester was complicated ,  was a boon for us, we were actually getting to know more from the phone call with Dr Reshu about what to expect and medication/food recommendation.\n\nAlthough after first semester, we planned to come back to Bangalore as we were not comfortable in Dubai. Thereafter until the delivery , the journey was smooth and as per expectation. Dr Reshu is very patient and would  listen to our query and answer with lot of information, every visit to her was our excitement to know about our baby more.\n\nThe consultation and online support (quick WhatsApp chats) really helped us to live fearless and enjoy this pregnancy period as we knew what to expect every week and she was always there for a quick chat or phone call which assured her presence always.\n\nAlso to mention, our labor experience was also swift and smooth  given we had some challenges and Doctor handled it nicely and this experience is something we would treasure it for life-long.\n\nI highly recommend to consult Dr Reshu mam for your parental journey. If you have any complications/issues please visit her without thinking twice..\n\nWe are blessed with baby in July\u2764\ufe0f and we are thankful to Dr. Reshu mam for her guidance and treatment.",

It took us 6 months to cope up with the emotional and physical stress to gather ourselves to try again. We did not want to go ahead with previous physicians as we felt that enough attention was not paid during the critical months that may have resulted in our loss.\n\nDr. Reshu came as a saviour and we felt a renewed hope with positivity visiting her clinic in Whitefield. Initially , we were taken aback by her cool , mature and focussed approach to managing pregnancy. We were hoping for long motivational sessions with her to address our apprehensions and fears. However , Dr. Reshu\u2019s mantra was to not look back trying to replay any event from last pregnancy and take everything one step at a time. With Covid 2nd wave creating a huge concern , she calmed our nerves and explained all the risk factors as well as her interventions.\n\nWhen it came to decide on the final date for delivery , she actively recommended that we go ahead with the procedure in 37 weeks instead of waiting any longer to avoid foetal distress. We had utmost trust in her and by God\u2019s grace we are blessed with a baby girl who just turned 1 in Aug 2022.\n\nWe cannot recommend Dr. Reshu and Cogent clinic enough to expecting parents as you would be in expert hands , in a positive environment and receive matter of fact explanations one step at a time.\n",

Now, when these things can come out naturally and it doesn't harm to wait for a few days more, Dr. Reshu was erring in taking the undue risk of anesthesia for a procedure that was not necessary & urgent.\nc) Not sure what her motive was but your guess is as good as mine.\n\nI am just glad that we went to other doctor, took her advice and it came out naturally without any medicines or manual intervention.\n\n* ***** ****** ** ***** ** ********** ** **** ******* ** * ******** ********* *** * *** *** *** **** ******** ** *** *********** strictly based on my experience, I would not go there again.",

She made me feel very positive. She is very calm and patient. She will never write any unnecessary medicines or never advise any unnecessary tests. She is a big supporter of normal delivery and always advises to be strong. She was always available over whatsapp and promptly replies to even small doubts I had. I am blessed with 2 kids and both are delivered healthy by Reshu madam. My second child was delivered during Covid19 times and she has suggested and guided us well in taking right decisions. I would say , it is a big big big positive feedback from my side.\n\n10 Starts for Staff: The staffs are well trained and have good experience in handling. They are very friendly ,focused and have very good attitude and compassionate towards patients. During Covid19 all staff are wearing PPE and are maintaining very good care and hygiene in the clinic.\n\n10 Stars for Caretakers: The extra stars for the caretakers of the clinic who are maintaining full hygiene of the clinic during these times. They are also on their toes and keep on sanitizing the places every time the patient uses a place.\n\n10 Stars for Clinic/Management: The clinic is so well located, has a lift, spacious and they know how to manage the patients well and we did not had any discomfort during any of our visits to clinic.\n\nBased on my experience, I hugely recommend Cogent Care Clinic.",

During my first pregnancy I realized that there is no one in this world like Reshu ma'am.She is a wonderful doctor with human values.. ..She supports the patient a lot on emotional level.  Which is very important for a pregnant woman... I always feel a different connection with her... Maybe everyone can feel it because she is like that.. That's why when I again got pregnant...I was in Indore...I met many doctors in Indore but I was not comfortable with anyone and contacted Reshu ma'am and decided that I will go with Reshu ma'am only. I met her only once in January 2019 and I managed my pregnancy as per her advice through WhatsApp and phone.  And in August 2019 I traveled from Indore to Bengaluru and delivered my second baby safely under her care... If she had not been there I would not have been able to manage anything.. She is the angel of my life..Many times, I tried to write reviews about her but I couldn't.  .. Because I don't have words to describe her.. Truly she is amazing.. .. I always respect you and am grateful to you.. No one is like you... Love you\u2764 ma'am ...",

She is very soft spoken, yet she speaks to the point. Her medications and diagnostic tests are also very much to the point - not too less or not too much. Her clinic has walk in consultation early in the morning, which enables us to consult with her without taking leaves on working days. She's available and responsive on whatsapp chat for pregnancy related doubts.I had suffered from a missed miscarriage and chemical pregnancy loss last year and was totally heartbroken by it! When I conceived again, I consulted Dr Reshu. 1st trimester:Knowing my prior history, she took extreme care and monitored me and my baby very closely during the first trimester. I had internal bleeding issue, which got caught during her monitoring. She advised me bed rest until 5th month as the internal bleeding was not yet affecting the baby. It's indeed a blessing that I came across Dr Reshu, else this issue could have been missed or detected much later!2nd trimester:My bleeding issue got resolved but I got infected with covid via my husband. I got a panic attack about getting infected with covid from my hubby and got concerns about baby's health if I do get infected! Here Dr Reshu's composure, soothing voice and friendly tone - along with my complete faith on her - helped me sail through the entire covid infection. Physically the infection was very mild but emotional stress was much higher. Here Dr Reshu helped me calm down and handle my emotional stress, which was a major part of fighting the infection! This is very rare among doctors nowadays! I held on to her words whenever I felt panicky and fought the infection with more courage!At the end of covid, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Dr Reshu handled it very well and kept it under control with the right amount of tests, diet changes and medicines.3rd trimester:Since my placenta was anterior high, dr allowed me prenatal yoga. Baby's and my health were all fine so she didn't order unnecessary scans. However she's always available and responsive on whatsapp for doubts and queries as during the third trimester, symptoms can get confusing. I always kept Dr Reshu informed about anything which I felt was odd. Her responsiveness helped me keep myself sane and also avoided unnecessary trips to clinic for every small questions.Delivery: I had to be admitted to hospital in emergency as my amniotic fluid has started leaking. However, the labour and delivery went quite smoothly. Dr Reshu was constantly monitoring my status from on duty doctors, until she reached the hospital. She delivered my baby with her cheerful and energetic voice to give me extra energy to push as I was getting tired towards the end! She brought my beautiful baby boy in this world \ud83d\udc95 May God shower her with all the blessings, happiness and success in the world! ",

It was a precious pregnancy, and we visited 3 doctors before meeting her. In our first visit to Dr. Reshu, as soon as our conversation started , a sense of trust got instilled inside and we were extremely satisfied. She took extreme cognisance of my medical history and kept on tracking all medical reports with diligence. Unlike other doctors, she gave us ample time during our visits, ensured all the queries got answered and always provided reasons behind prescribed medicines. There were lots of instances where we felt, she has no interest in making moey from her patients by suggesting unnecessary scans/tests instead all her suggestions, medicines, scans , tests were backed by strong rationale. As the time passed , the TRUST we had on her was unbeatable, whatever she said, we just accepted without any second thought. She tried for my normal delivery till the last moment but due to some complications and to eliminate any underlying risk , she immediately took me for Cesarean. During my Cesarean, she kept talking to me, kept me calm and made it a cakewalk.\n\nShe guides you like a mentor, treats you like a family and these qualities make her an amazing doctor and a wonderful human being. The positive vibes from her would make her patient feel so safe and secure.\n\nAt last , just want to say, I strongly feel she is just like her name- and nothing can go wrong if you are under her treatment, that's my level of trust and confidence on her.\n\n*** **** *** **** ************** *** *** **** ****** * * **** **** **** ******* Highly recommended!!!!!\nThanks Mam!!",

                "review_text": "So I travelled to Bangalore- my hometown from abroad for my delivery when I was about 30 week pregnant. I am a first time mom and I did not know any doctor personally in Bangalore, so when enquired I was recommended Dr. Reshu by a lot of my friends who previously have been her patients and my Uncle. I was skeptical about how things will be handled during the ongoing pandemic but I was impressed with the way Dr Reshu dealt with the whole process. She is kind and understanding, her approach towards dealing with patients is something that I really liked about her. She is gentle and supportive. Always available on call/msgs for any kind of doubts or questions. Pregnancy is a phase where in women deal with unknowns/uncertainty  everyday and it is important to have a doctor who understands your state of mind and i am grateful to Dr Reshu as I could just count on her for everything.\nFrom my birth experience I can tell that she is a doctor who is well prepared for every situation and is organised, quick. I was always given the options/choices for my delivery -may it be the hospital, the type of delivery etc and I never felt that she decided things for me and I was in total control of what I wanted as part of my birth plan.\n\nPost delivery contact/support- there are many occasions when I have contacted her on call/msgs post delivery and she has been available to hear me and help me out at the earliest she could.\n\nFrom my personal experience, I highly recommend her to anybody who is looking for a gynaec in Bangalore.",

We will try to call out both positives and negatives in terms of consulting this doctor, while trying to be objective and not being judgemental. \nPositives:\n1) As pointed out by many others here, we completely agree that Dr. Reshu is one of those few doctors who do not prescribe *********** tests and medicines to the patients and empty their pockets; she suggests only those medicines that are absolutely required\n2) She is very calm and composed all the time, and this calmness with composure can rub off to the patient*** *** ** ****** in minimal invasive surgeries which we got to experience positively during the LH surgery for my mom's uterus removal\n4) She is very practical and objective in her approach during treatment\n\nNegatives:\n** **** ************* ****** *** **** ************* * *** ***** ******** ** ********* **** *************** ********* *********** the doctor can be objective and engage in only small-talk while treating the patient; but for issues like PCOS and Early Pregnancy Loss - Miscarriage in 1st trimester (which we are suffering from), where there is a lot of psychological and emotional trauma involved, you would expect the gynaec to not just focus on the medical treatment but also provide some counseling to patient who would be going thru lot of guilt and other emotional issues etc. due to miscarriage. A case in point being - we visited her 2 days ago with positive pregnancy test result and 35 HCG level, she asked us to do HCG test in 48 hrs and indicated that the levels are low for 5th week.. and when we told her today that she had heavy bleeding along with mucous fluids and all that stuff in the last 2 days and the HCG has dropped to 9, she told us **** ************ that this proves the pregnancy didn't work and she just asked us to wait for 1 month and resume planning till 3 months - she didn't even bother to ask how my wife's mental state is, whether she is feeling any guilt or negative concerns about conceiving in the future, she didn't bother to explain the biological process of what actually happened, what should have happened, and what should we do to improve our chances, ******* **** ** *** ******* ****** **** **** * all she said was that this could be anything, it is very normal, keep planning for another 3 months - btw, we have been planning since last 1.5-2 years and have been consulting her regularly regarding this; I also observed that she doesn't bother to go through previous reports in the file we gave to her, to check the history on TSH, Hb1Ac, Thyroid etc. She was asking us for those values, and when we couldn't remember, she asked us to have those tests again;\n2) She always seems to be in a rush to send the patient away from the room, ** ** *** ******** ** ** ***** ** **** ******** ** ******** ** *** **** ******* **** ****** **** ***** **** **** **** ******* **** ***** ** ** causing stuff like not taking time to talk to patient about her emotional health, *** ******** *** *** ********* ****** ** ****** ******* not providing any counseling whatsoever, *** ***** ******* *** ******* ******* ** ****** ******** ******** *************** During the numerous visits we have made during last 3 years, it is my observation that her average consulting time per patient is hardly 3-4 minutes!\n3) *** ************* ***** ** ****** ******* *** ************* **** *** **** ****** ** ********** **** ** *** **** ***** *** ***** ** ******** *** ****** **** **** ******* **** *** *** *** ************ ******* ** ****** ** ********* **** ** **** *** ******* **** *********** ** ** **** ** ******* ********** ** ******* ****** *** ********* ***** **** ********* ******* ***** She is also not very approachable in general; ** **** ** ** ********** ** *** **** ******** ****** *** ** **** ************ ****** ** ******* ****** she responds to your intense WhatsApp msgs with blunt one-liners, very similar to the face-to-face exchange.\nThis leads to an absolute lack of warmth or compassion or comfort feeling between the patient and her; with very mechanical and incomplete conversations.\n\n***** ** ** ******* **** *** ***** ** * **** ******* ************ **** ***** ****** *********** ** *** ******* ****** *** *** ***** ****** ********** ** *** ********** ******* ***** * **** ****** *** * ***** ******* *** ** * **** ****** *** ********** *** * ***** ******* *** we are not recommending her primarily due to this reason - her not being there for us when we needed",

However, we realized we need to have better consultation and approached Dr Reshu for online consultation while we were there.\n\nDr Reshu is well known in our circle with our family and friends and we knew from the starting we were in good hands. The online consultation and the assurance ,especially when the first trimester was complicated ,  was a boon for us, we were actually getting to know more from the phone call with Dr Reshu about what to expect and medication/food recommendation.\n\nAlthough after first semester, we planned to come back to Bangalore as we were not comfortable in Dubai. Thereafter until the delivery , the journey was smooth and as per expectation. Dr Reshu is very patient and would  listen to our query and answer with lot of information, every visit to her was our excitement to know about our baby more.\n\nThe consultation and online support (quick WhatsApp chats) really helped us to live fearless and enjoy this pregnancy period as we knew what to expect every week and she was always there for a quick chat or phone call which assured her presence always.\n\nAlso to mention, our labor experience was also swift and smooth  given we had some challenges and Doctor handled it nicely and this experience is something we would treasure it for life-long.\n\nI highly recommend to consult Dr Reshu mam for your parental journey. If you have any complications/issues please visit her without thinking twice..\n\nWe are blessed with baby in July\u2764\ufe0f and we are thankful to Dr. Reshu mam for her guidance and treatment.",

                "review_text": "The saying that \"Doctors are God\u2019s reflection on earth\" holds true for Dr. Reshu and the credit for ensuring a safe pregnancy for us through difficult circumstances is well deserved.\n\nWe had suffered an unexpected loss of our first child in Aug 2019 during 7th month of pregnancy and were devastated. It took us 6 months to cope up with the emotional and physical stress to gather ourselves to try again. We did not want to go ahead with previous physicians as we felt that enough attention was not paid during the critical months that may have resulted in our loss.\n\nDr. Reshu came as a saviour and we felt a renewed hope with positivity visiting her clinic in Whitefield. Initially , we were taken aback by her cool , mature and focussed approach to managing pregnancy. We were hoping for long motivational sessions with her to address our apprehensions and fears. However , Dr. Reshu\u2019s mantra was to not look back trying to replay any event from last pregnancy and take everything one step at a time. With Covid 2nd wave creating a huge concern , she calmed our nerves and explained all the risk factors as well as her interventions.\n\nWhen it came to decide on the final date for delivery , she actively recommended that we go ahead with the procedure in 37 weeks instead of waiting any longer to avoid foetal distress. We had utmost trust in her and by God\u2019s grace we are blessed with a baby girl who just turned 1 in Aug 2022.\n\nWe cannot recommend Dr. Reshu and Cogent clinic enough to expecting parents as you would be in expert hands , in a positive environment and receive matter of fact explanations one step at a time.\n",

Now, when these things can come out naturally and it doesn't harm to wait for a few days more, Dr. Reshu was erring in taking the undue risk of anesthesia for a procedure that was not necessary & urgent.\nc) Not sure what her motive was but your guess is as good as mine.\n\nI am just glad that we went to other doctor, took her advice and it came out naturally without any medicines or manual intervention.\n\n* ***** ****** ** ***** ** ********** ** **** ******* ** * ******** ********* *** * *** *** *** **** ******** ** *** *********** strictly based on my experience, I would not go there again.",

Doctor gave sufficient time, explained everything in detail and made the complete road map for us how to go ahead.\n\nWe are really very happy with the clinic staffs and doctor. \n\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Reshu Saraogi for any pregnancy related issues and also the infertility problems.\n\nJust on discussing with our friends in office, I came to know that she is the gynaec of many of our colleagues in office and all of them have similar views for her. \n\nShe is simple, calm and down to earth, not money monetary minded and completey patient centric.\n\nShe did the laparoscopic surgery for uterus remover for one of my friend s mother, because of her treament one of my colleague undergoing long term fertility treatment conceived. \n\nAnd with God s grace and the ample support of Reshu mam we alco completed our family with a beautiful kid.\n\nThanks a lot again mam, * *** * *** ** *** ****** *** *** **** ********* *** **** ** **** ******\n\nWe wouuld be everly obliged to you and will recommend you to anyone who has female problems.\n\nYou had more patience than us and you waited and waited for the baby to deliver normally.

It's really amazing to see doctors spending their night also sometimes in the hospital with the patients and again start their work in the morning as routine.\n\nHats off to your family also for all the support.",

She made me feel very positive. She is very calm and patient. She will never write any unnecessary medicines or never advise any unnecessary tests. She is a big supporter of normal delivery and always advises to be strong. She was always available over whatsapp and promptly replies to even small doubts I had. I am blessed with 2 kids and both are delivered healthy by Reshu madam. My second child was delivered during Covid19 times and she has suggested and guided us well in taking right decisions. I would say , it is a big big big positive feedback from my side.\n\n10 Starts for Staff: The staffs are well trained and have good experience in handling. They are very friendly ,focused and have very good attitude and compassionate towards patients. During Covid19 all staff are wearing PPE and are maintaining very good care and hygiene in the clinic.\n\n10 Stars for Caretakers: The extra stars for the caretakers of the clinic who are maintaining full hygiene of the clinic during these times. They are also on their toes and keep on sanitizing the places every time the patient uses a place.\n\n10 Stars for Clinic/Management: The clinic is so well located, has a lift, spacious and they know how to manage the patients well and we did not had any discomfort during any of our visits to clinic.\n\nBased on my experience, I hugely recommend Cogent Care Clinic.",

She is very dedicated, highly punctual, always positive and practical. she doesn't suggest any unwanted tests/medicines. She is always straight to the point and very very confident on what she does and what she suggests. She does laproscopic/surgeries effortlessly. *** ** * **** ******** ******** ** *** *** ********* She listens to all our problems very patiently. Whatever could be the problem she doesn't lose hope, she'll find a way to success. Cogent care has a tie up with lab n scanning is also available at clinic hence everything can be done at one place very fast, we need not run around. And I must mention about the consultation time or waiting time.. Very less waiting time, scan/consultation can be done within 30mins(including waiting time). And doctor is available at clinic at sharp 8AM sometimes even before 8am but has never been late so far. Till date haven't heard that doctor is unavailable or on leave. And whenever I have any doubt irrespective of the time she is reachable on phone which is a great plus.. My confidence level n hope increasses when I meet Reshu.. I'm very much satisfied with the experience. I would strongly recommend Dr. Reshu for any gynaec problems. ",

She patiently listens to all the queries and also responds on WhatsApp as soon as she gets free. My baby had pooped in the womb. Her timely and quick diagnosis led to smooth delivery. I will always stay thankful to the Doctor :)",

We were consulting some other doctor before coming to Reshu mam for treatment and earlier doctor scared us a lot during scans telling like baby might have some bones issue and all . but the way Reshu mam explained the situation and gave us hope to continue and always attended me with positivity really helped us going through the difficult phase of our life. Her   treatment is  really good. We are blessed with baby a year back, and grateful for her and others who did the delivery and post care of our baby. We recommend her to our friends, family and others.",

I had gone to many gynaecologist but none of them have found out the cause of fertility in me ..it's been only 2 months under  dr.gursimran Kaur and mam has found  the cause of my infertility by doing a very important and simple procedure ..which I know many of the ladies are scared of . It's called Diagnostic hysteroscopy and laproscopy. Last week I underwent this procedure at Manipal hospital. She did my surgery very well . I thought it is going to be a painful procedure but it was absolutely not. Here under anaesthesia u don't feel any pain and my report came out to be normal. I was not aware that I had a polyp in my cervix that was kind of blocking the passage . Mam removed it and i was told as per my HSG report that my left tube is blocked , but during this procedure they will also examine ur tubes and ovaries , uterus and everything was normal . So I just want to convey this message to all the ladies out there who are worried and scared to carry out this procedure..this procedure is very safe and Dr. reshu is one of the finest laproscopic surgeon. I want to thank Dr. reshu for ruling out the cause and for carrying out the surgery so well. Today is the 6th day of my surgery and I am absolutely fine , doing all my house hold stuffs , even I have joined back my office. Post operatively there was no complication. I want to thank all the nursing staffs , medical staffs at Manipal for their care and specially their smiling face and the way they will treat will make u forget all ur stress.I would highly recommend all those who are advised for this DHL procedure should go for it without any hesitation .",

Her confidence, clarity of thoughts and the way she explains you every detail made her my and my husband\u2019s first choice for my pregnancy journey. She helped me sail smoothly through my first trimester anxiety. She never sugar coated any information or possible dangers. Her frank opinion about little things like traveling / chances of miscarriage in the first trimester helped me so much make clear choices for myself that time. *** ***** ***** *** *** *********** ***** ** ****** However, if she felt the need or gauged any possible complication, she guided me in the best possible way(again without any sugar coatings). Her staff at the her clinic are also very helpful and give you a motherly touch. Making sure that any injection doesn\u2019t pain a lot , calming you down when anxious and even praying for you if there was a red flag, I have experienced everything there. Even during pandemic times, they were handling everything so well. Not to forget to mention, dr.  is always available to reply to your queries on WhatsApp or phone as well. I went into labor at 4 in the morning and she was there, just a call away . Around 6 I had my little bundle of joy in my arms. The delivery was so smooth that I had never imagined. I can\u2019t thank her enough and her entire staff for being there with me and my husband in this journey and making it so beautiful and memorable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo",

Keeping this in mind we went to check for 2nd opinion for the first time, as we were not satisfied with previous Dr whom we consulted initially at MANIPAL.\n\nSince my wife has PCOS she was not able to conceive since 2 Yrs of marriage. \nDr Reshu quickly understood what is the problem and what is the treatment to be given to get pregnant at the earliest keeping the age factor in mind. It was clearly explained to us. She made a positive hope and thus we had trust and started the treatment from her. She is good in analysis and gives proper advise/guidance. During this Pandemic situation, as a Dr she does her duty well by checking the patient with high safety and with care. Both husband and wife are allowed to consult with Dr. We can sit near to the Dr and explain the problem where as other Dr don't even allows us to sit near. We are happy being consulted with her. \n\nCost is very reasonable when compared to other famous clinic and hospital. Appointment is first come first serve through token system. She herself will take scanning and explains us showing the screen Monitor. She has lab inside the clinic so one can give blood or urine samples there itself and charges are same as like other laboratory centers. We could see many people coming from long distance. They maintain social distancing and has sufficient space to sit. Clinic will be busy from morning 8AM. Attenders/Nurse/Billing people are humble. They were not panic at all when more crowd comes. Simply decent, well organised. We cant say anything negative. ",

There are essential facilities like scan and lab and the staff are patient friendly. She gives option for delivery/c scetion at the best hospitals in Whitefield, we opted for Manipal for the Neo-natology and other specialties there. Dr Reshu was there on the right time at Hospital for the c section procedure and she brought the good news to the family. We recommend Dr Reshu Sarogi to any couple looking for safe and secure care in pregnancy and at child birth. ",

I used to travel 25kms from my home for every visit as I had gained a lot of trust in her. Me & my husband used to list down all our questions before entering Mam's cabin but to our surprise, she used to answer all our queries even before we asked her.I am really thankful that I found her, who made my pregnancy journey so smooth and beautiful.I wish her all the happiness and success in the future.

I was overweight and obese and yet I had absolutely no problems throughout my pregnancy or even after it. For someone so scared and sceptical like me, if it can be so easy, for normal people it\u2019s going to be the most wonderful and reliable experience. She also patiently answered all my questions in every visit and was also more than available on WhatsApp. The clinic also is state of the art with excellent management and all test facilities available in house itself.

When my father visited Dr Alok Banka prior to meeting with Dr Reshu for his ear problems, he treated him very well. During his visit to Dr Alok Banka he came to know more about Dr Reshu hence he brought me  to her for my medical issues. Both visits were very pleasant and helpful to both of us. I wish them all the very best for their wonderful service to the needy.",

She's very reachable, she replies to your questions/doubts over messages and also responds to calls in emergency situations. I've already commended her to a friend and they are also quite satisfied with her. I would recommend Dr. Reshu for pregnant ladies.\n",

We were blessed with a boy at the end of our 11 months maternity treatment. After a few years of trying, we visited Dr. Reshu in October 2019. She explained to us at the onset that working on the fertility factors of the would be mother is the key and accordingly she started the treatment of my wife. Instead of rushing into a procedure she took us through the treatment one step at a time. After few months my wife conceived and thereafter started a 9 months watchful and careful treatment under Dr Reshu's experienced supervision. In these unprecedented times of Coronavirus, she was available on phone and WhatsApp to guide us through our anxious moments.\nPeople who are reading it, it may be a long review but I think any number of words are less to praise Dr Reshu.\n*** ** ****** *** ****",

The best thing I like about her is she does not force unnecessary medications or treatment. She encourages things to happen in their normal course of time. I had weight issues and the only thing she said to me was loose weight and see the difference and it actually worked. I wanted a normal delivery and she helped me with that. I consider her next to god as only because of her I was able to deliver normally and my pregnancy also went on pretty smoothly without any complications. I highly recommend her and with closed eyes I can say trust her and she will only do the best for you.",

I was able  to conceive in just 4 months after consulting her.\nIt is because of her effort our family is complete now. I don\u2019t have much words to express our gratitude towards her. \n\nI am completely satisfied with her treatment and would definitely recommend her. \n\nA very genuine, experienced and knowledgeable doctor.",

I was confused as I was showing that leading Dr. from the beginning. By chance I visited Dr. Reshu, she gave me all hope and confidence. And during my delivery I compelled her to do C-section because of pain but she patiently waited and convinced me to go for normal. She is very much talented and great. She did normal delivery to me . I will strongly recommend Dr.Reshu. nowadays doctors will make the delivery as c section inorder to grab amount from the patient. But this doctor is really concerned about the patient's health . Thank you Dr.Reshu...i will always remember you for ur care and concern for your patients.",

I moved in to bangalore in 2018 and met Dr. Reshu as a suggestion by a well wisher. Two year into my marriage I got pregnant and decided to consult her as I\u2019ve always found ease with her advices and medical services. It was a high risk pregnancy and in the first three months I was having lots of bleeding and spotting. But Dr. Reshu always ease me with her positivity and of course the medical treatment was on dot that my pregnancy was saved. She never insisted on unnecessary testing or medical expenses. Only what is needed and important was done. And above all she was always available/ approachable when called on an emergency. After my first trimester the next two went so well and time just flew. No complications what so ever. I was able to work till my 9th month. She\u2019s an angel sent from above. Now I have my beautiful boy who was born (normal delivery) on 5th December 2022 under her care and supervision.",

When I had any smallest of the smallest questions to ask her...she was always there to answer me,she makes her patients feel very calm during the process.. She was caring throughout my pregnancy... I rate her 5 stars as I have not come across anyone who is this caring to their patients\n\nIt was indeed a wonderful journey since it is my first pregnancy I was so tensed and after I visited you the friendly nature and kind approach you always attended to my queries since the initial days were very trivial you were an inspiration and always motivated and supported me throughout even during my last days the hospitality by the staff and the nurses were excellent and I can assure that I will suggest my family and friends to consult and seek your advice.A big thank you doctor I\u2019m indeed blessed.",

She never pani\u00e7ked in treatment, never wrote any unnecessary medicines or never advised any unnecessary lab tests. MI conceived and delivered a cute, healthy baby under her care. She is a big proponent of normal delivery. She was there with us in the mmiddle of night for delivery. Delivery took place at 2.30am. She had always been available for smallest of the doubt on whatsapp.\n\nExtra stars are for the management of Cogent care. The clinic is so well located, has a lift, hugely spacious and they know how to manage the patients well. \n\nA huge cheer and blessings to Cogent Care Clinic.\n",

I approached her with a case of previous ectopic pregnancy with one absent tube and mild endometriosis. She has a very comforting approach and I'm automatically relaxed once I speak to her. I had lots of concerns and queries which she handled well. Most important thing was that she didn't overload me with God-knows-what tablets unlike few other docs I've met. Every procedure and every step was perfectly explained to me. Special shout out to her staff at Cogent who were amazingly helpful and made me feel positive all throughout my visit. I have always believed that your gynae is someone who comforts you and removes any fear within you rather than create them by pointing out the multiple shortcomings in you. And she is perfect at that. She helped me make my dream come true and I'm grateful to her for the same. ",

She can be reached at any time, even in middle of the night in case of emergency. She solved all our queries patiently and made our journey smooth sailing. I would highly recommend her to other expecting mothers as her decisions are very precise at critical situations. And lastly I would thank her for my quick delivery. ",
