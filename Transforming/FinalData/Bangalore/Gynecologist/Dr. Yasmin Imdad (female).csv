We began to consult Dr. Yasmin from 7th week onwards, found her very comfortable, friendly, approachable, allocating enough time for us to discuss the progress every time. She had been advising, analyzing and treating precautionary measures based on health and BMS status week by week for progressing normal delivery as we had expressed our interest towards the same at the beginning.

Also, she has guided through all the parameters and specifically dietary habits which will keep both mother and baby health in control from the first trimester. My wife had developed gestational diabetes during the 2nd trimester which can lead to over weight of the baby and less possibility for a normal delivery. Therefore, she had advised us to workout, follow a perfect diet to control diabetes to maintain good mother and baby weight as well as to monitor blood sugar level periodically at home through which we had controlled blood sugar level.

She prescribed medicines, tests and follow-up week-by-week to monitor and develop good health for mother and baby, we just followed her foot-steps which had led to labor pain on the day when we had completed 38 weeks, and the delivery pain progressed very well. Though it was very painful for my wife, our doctor advised and strengthened us at timely to deliver our baby in a span of 3-4 hours without going for an epidural (painless method).

She treated and provided the best care when my wife had developed swelling and opening in the episiotomy area after delivery, also she asked us to do certain home treatments which really worked well and led to speedy recovery.

Throughout, our experience with Dr. Yasmin Imdad was very great, safe, comfortable and satisfying in all the scenarios as we simply have to go with her guidance and treatments. We strongly recommend Dr. Yasmin Imdad with the best experience which we have had.
