But atleast i wanted a doctor who would attempt n encourage fr a natural birthing process as long as things r favourable however Dr.Shyla was always in favour of C sec since the time i strted seeing her in the 5th mnth not once she encouraged fr a normal delivery, whereas Dr. Sunil tried all possibilities to help me deliver normally ..he explains the situation well , the plan of treatment , risks involved and gives confidence to the patient that she is in safe hands. He does not give up and considers his patients requirement and supports as far as he can. If not for him i would definitely hav had a c sec.

Happy to share that we are blessed with cute princessafter few failures due to my health issues.But he was thorough in his explanations and took his time answering my questions, often anticipating them. I was further impressed with his incredible professional responsiveness in terms of communication. He responded to messages and phone calls within the same day and always contacted me personally after lab results came in. These qualities alone would have set him apart from other doctors but Dr. Sunil went further. Unlike gynac at other medical institutions, he was proactive about addressing the various physiological conditions I had going on. He understood that every factor, however minor, is still a factor, and he dealt with each one head on. His expertise made me feel reassured, confident and taken care of. Medical institutions aren't always so in tune with individual needs. Patients are usually one of many and are treated as such. Dr. Sunil treats each patient as if they are the only one, and it is remarkable that he makes what could potentially be an impersonal institutional context more personal and thoughtful.\"For this Me and my family are very thankful to Dr. Sunil Eshwar and the entire staff of Aikya hospital ..The staff of Aikya Hospital were very patient, cooperative and supportive .

He handed over all his cases to his assistant who was less experienced and confused on how to deal with patient.\nWe were helpless, and had to continue the treatment from his assistant.

Happy to share that we are blessed with cute princessafter few failures due to my health issues.But he was thorough in his explanations and took his time answering my questions, often anticipating them. I was further impressed with his incredible professional responsiveness in terms of communication. He responded to messages and phone calls within the same day and always contacted me personally after lab results came in. These qualities alone would have set him apart from other doctors but Dr. Sunil went further. Unlike gynac at other medical institutions, he was proactive about addressing the various physiological conditions I had going on. He understood that every factor, however minor, is still a factor, and he dealt with each one head on. His expertise made me feel reassured, confident and taken care of. Medical institutions aren't always so in tune with individual needs. Patients are usually one of many and are treated as such. Dr. Sunil treats each patient as if they are the only one, and it is remarkable that he makes what could potentially be an impersonal institutional context more personal and thoughtful.\"For this Me and my family are very thankful to Dr. Sunil Eshwar and the entire staff of Aikya hospital ..The staff of Aikya Hospital were very patient, cooperative and supportive . Thanks to you guy",

My second pregnancy had ups and downs and had risk of delivering at 7th month but with his right suggestions and medications I could delay the delivery and had healthy baby born near to due date.

I was consulting him in Apollo Cradle, Brookfield and was happy with the treatment.\nI started my IVF cycle, started taking the injection for egg retrieval and then suddenly one day (2 days prior to egg retrieval) I came to know he left the hospital. He handed over all his cases to his assistant who was less experienced and confused on how to deal with patient.\nWe were helpless, and had to continue the treatment from his assistant. Of-course,  the treatment was a complete failure and almost after 1 year I am still having lots of health issues ...running from one doctor to another. He is unprofessional and not reliable. Anyone consulting him, please check if he has any plans to switch hospitals.\n\n",

I managed to get in touch with the doctor through a pretty humble helpfull girl Lyma. Only doctor that I could rely my confidence on was Dr. Sunil Eshwar. I gained my confidence after I had taken my mom for consultation a day prior to operation. The way he explains the consequences and comforts the patient not to be worried about the operation indicates he is an expert and is an extrovert. Dr. Sunil Eshwar has been much more than just a doctor. You have been my therapist, supporter, friend, well wisher and angel in disguise.  I value the fact that your staff\u2019s attitude was great. Thank you.",

Upon relying on word of mouth from close sources, I contacted Dr. Sunil Eshwar. On the first consultation itself, there was a positive vibe (I'm not exaggerating) and no doubt he is so popular. He patiently listens to us, friendly talkative and can be tuff at times if you don't follow his advice rightfully. Glad to be treated by a doctor who is highly efficient and passionate about his work. After consultation and assessment for few months, he advised laproscopic surgery which truly made an impact and I conceived in just a couple of months. Truly grateful to him and his amazing team for giving ray of hope again. I'm counting weeks, maybe days, soon to be mom again:-) :-) \n\nMany thanks to Dr. Sunil Eshwar and his team: Dr. Shivani Chandan, Dr. Smriti Nayak and Mrs. Naseemus Saher (Department Co-ordinator).

He fills his patients with optimism.I felt little or no pain during and after minor and major procedures.

The best thing about Dr. Eshwar is the correct calculative approach. All doctors we have consulted before prescribed the same medicine, but Doctor Sunil knows when what to give with what quantum. We have never felt he has prescribed anything unnecessary. * *** **** ** ** *** ******** **** ********.
