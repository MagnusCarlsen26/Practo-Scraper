When my mom needed help with her health, Dr. Aruna Kumari's kindness and good treatment quickly made us trust her. She always listened carefully and talked to us in a way that made us feel better.\n\nWhen my mom needed a D&C test and biopsy, Dr. Aruna Kumari did it very well, and my mom recovered well. Even though she moved to Cloudnine Hospitals, which was far away, we still trusted her enough to go back to her when my mom had another health problem two years later.\n\nEven though we saw a local doctor and had some tests done, we always believed Dr. Aruna Kumari was the best choice. She planned for the surgery in Manipal Hospital, Sarjapur Road as there is frozen section available. She guided us through everything, getting us ready for a big surgery. Before the surgery, she talked with us to make sure we understood what was happening, and she was always available when we called or messaged her.\n\nDuring the surgery, Dr. Aruna Kumari always told us what was happening, and even though it took longer than expected, everything went well because of her expertise. When my mom was in the hospital, Dr. Aruna Kumari's visits made her feel happier and helped her get better.\n\nWe've become really close to Dr. Aruna Kumari, more than just as doctor and patient. She showed us what great care looks like, and we're really grateful to her for everything she did for us. She's the kind of doctor we hope everyone could have. We want to say a big thank you to Dr. Aruna Kumari for being there for us every step of the way.",

The very first visit was extremely satisfactory and Dr Aruna made us feel like she is part of our family and shared her number as well to approach her, whenever the need arises. She off-loaded all our stress from our minds and time passed so quickly that we did not realize.\n\nAlso, my wife was in favour of normal delivery, Dr Aruna\u2019s suggestion has always been like it depends in circumstances, which is very true, she was used to explaining each and everything in detail and was used to please us. At last, my wife underwent normal delivery, which was an awesome feeling for both of us.\n\nReally, we are very lucky to have Dr Aruna Kumari V !! We are thankful from the bottom of our heart for you doing so much for us and making us feel great \uf04a \uf04a, it\u2019s really a feeling that cannot be described in words \u2026.. \n",

When my mom needed help with her health, Dr. Aruna Kumari's kindness and good treatment quickly made us trust her. She always listened carefully and talked to us in a way that made us feel better.\n\nWhen my mom needed a D&C test and biopsy, Dr. Aruna Kumari did it very well, and my mom recovered well. Even though she moved to Cloudnine Hospitals, which was far away, we still trusted her enough to go back to her when my mom had another health problem two years later.\n\nEven though we saw a local doctor and had some tests done, we always believed Dr. Aruna Kumari was the best choice. She planned for the surgery in Manipal Hospital, Sarjapur Road as there is frozen section available. She guided us through everything, getting us ready for a big surgery. Before the surgery, she talked with us to make sure we understood what was happening, and she was always available when we called or messaged her.\n\nDuring the surgery, Dr. Aruna Kumari always told us what was happening, and even though it took longer than expected, everything went well because of her expertise. When my mom was in the hospital, Dr. Aruna Kumari's visits made her feel happier and helped her get better.\n\nWe've become really close to Dr. Aruna Kumari, more than just as doctor and patient. She showed us what great care looks like, and we're really grateful to her for everything she did for us. She's the kind of doctor we hope everyone could have. We want to say a big thank you to Dr. Aruna Kumari for being there for us every step of the way.",

The very first visit was extremely satisfactory and Dr Aruna made us feel like she is part of our family and shared her number as well to approach her, whenever the need arises. She off-loaded all our stress from our minds and time passed so quickly that we did not realize.\n\nAlso, my wife was in favour of normal delivery, Dr Aruna\u2019s suggestion has always been like it depends in circumstances, which is very true, she was used to explaining each and everything in detail and was used to please us. At last, my wife underwent normal delivery, which was an awesome feeling for both of us.\n\nReally, we are very lucky to have Dr Aruna Kumari V !! We are thankful from the bottom of our heart for you doing so much for us and making us feel great \uf04a \uf04a, it\u2019s really a feeling that cannot be described in words \u2026.. \n",

She has always been available over phone and messages for big or small queries and responds to them patiently with all details. My labour was induced late at night and she constantly monitored the progress throughout. Eventually due to complication she promptly took decision of emergency c section and we were blessed with an angel.\nShe clearly explains the course of treatment and advises medication only if absolutely necessary (focuses on lifestyle change and natural treatment). Her consultation sessions have always been assuring that everything is going to be alright despite all complications. We are extremely grateful for her support and for sure made the right decision to select Dr. Aruna for our pregnancy journey.",

She gives ample time to see and gives all the necessary suggestions not to leave any doubt in our mind. She does not unnecessarily call us for consultation or lab tests or scanning or medicines. Instead she advises us to call or message unless its very necessary to meet. We were really satisfied and would recommend her always. ",
