Being into High risk category her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial through out the period. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She has always been available and responded to all our queries even in the wee hours. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy wasnt a very smooth one but Dr. Yasmin ensured we were calmed down everytime we panicked. Even during the delivery process she was available at all times and ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. We are blessed with a baby girl and we are thankful to Dr.Yasmin as it wouldn't have been possible without her support. We would definitely recommend her to all the future parents to be.",

We began to consult Dr. Yasmin from 7th week onwards, found her very comfortable, friendly, approachable, allocating enough time for us to discuss the progress every time. She had been advising, analyzing and treating precautionary measures based on health and BMS status week by week for progressing normal delivery as we had expressed our interest towards the same at the beginning.\n\nAlso, she has guided through all the parameters and specifically dietary habits which will keep both mother and baby health in control from the first trimester. My wife had developed gestational diabetes during the 2nd trimester which can lead to over weight of the baby and less possibility for a normal delivery. Therefore, she had advised us to workout, follow a perfect diet to control diabetes to maintain good mother and baby weight as well as to monitor blood sugar level periodically at home through which we had controlled blood sugar level.\n\nShe prescribed medicines, tests and follow-up week-by-week to monitor and develop good health for mother and baby, we just followed her foot-steps which had led to labor pain on the day when we had completed 38 weeks, and the delivery pain progressed very well. Though it was very painful for my wife, our doctor advised and strengthened us at timely to deliver our baby in a span of 3-4 hours without going for an epidural (painless method).\n\nShe treated and provided the best care when my wife had developed swelling and opening in the episiotomy area after delivery, also she asked us to do certain home treatments which really worked well and led to speedy recovery.\n\nThroughout, our experience with Dr. Yasmin Imdad was very great, safe, comfortable and satisfying in all the scenarios as we simply have to go with her guidance and treatments. We strongly recommend Dr. Yasmin Imdad with the best experience which we have had.\n\nDr. Yasmin Imdad, we sincerely thank you for caring, guiding and providing best care throughout and brought us to successful normal delivery as this was our first pregnancy and you have really made us very special. Thank you doctor :-)",

From beginning onwards she was very humble and supportive. **** ********* ******** *** ********** ***** ****** **** ******** I developed gestational diabetes but she made me calm for this and suggested necessary precautions and diet. She was monitoring my sugar level on phone every alternate day. During the covid situation she was always available on phone and was clearing all doubts regarding labor pain. On the time of delivery my husband was not with me as he got dengue and admitted to different hospital but just because of Dr. Yasmin I took decision to deliver on planned date of delivery by induced labor method in Rainbow hospital. She informed other doctors about my situation and Delivery went very smooth. Post delivery I got fever, she took my case very seriously and monitored everything until I got discharge. A very BIG Thanks to her, she made my pregnancy journey wonderful . I strongly recommend her for pregnancy and delivery.  \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

The very first interaction was so appealing that we were convinced that we were  in right hands and decided to stick with the doctor until delivery which eventually happened in July 2020 . Her friendliness, ability to hear out and provide right recommendations really makes her stands apart from others . We had made a request to doctor that we would like to normal delivery and she ensured that it happened despite of the fact that my wife became diabetic during pregnancy and child weight was on the higher side . Her timely diagnosis and right suggestions made the difference . The best part was her connect with the patient during the testing times because of covid situation , she remained available over phone watsapp for any queries .At last during the delivery day , she ensured that she is available for the delivery herself during mid night and kept following up with patient and duty doctors throughout her admission . I could not thank her enough for all she has done for us . I highly do recommend Yasmin Mam if you stay near ORR , marathalli or Whitefield and trust me you won't regret your decision . Thanks Anshu ",

She listens to patient and clearly explains the medical condition and treatment.\u00a0Qualification blended with humility makes her a wonderful doctor.I visited her for complete duration of pregnancy\u00a0till delivery and now for post delivery care. In the later phase of my pregnancy, I got\u00a0Intrahepatic\u00a0cholestasis of pregnancy and\u00a0Gestational diabetes\u00a0mellitus. She handled the situation with swift and confidence. She never gave a room for panic. Finally, I had a pre-term delivery and Doctor visited me in odd hours to make sure everything is going fine with me. She was continuously\u00a0in touch via phone/whatsapp during my hospitalization. Dr. performed c-section after non progressing labor on Diwali evening and I was bless with a baby. I was touched by her commitment as a Doctor.Thank you Dr Yashmin Ma'am. Thank you very much.",

Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She has always been available and responded to all our queries even in the wee hours. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy wasnt a very smooth one but Dr. Yasmin ensured we were calmed down everytime we panicked. Even during the delivery process she was available at all times and ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. We are blessed with a baby girl and we are thankful to Dr.Yasmin as it wouldn't have been possible without her support. We would definitely recommend her to all the future parents to be.",

We began to consult Dr. Yasmin from 7th week onwards, found her very comfortable, friendly, approachable, allocating enough time for us to discuss the progress every time. She had been advising, analyzing and treating precautionary measures based on health and BMS status week by week for progressing normal delivery as we had expressed our interest towards the same at the beginning.\n\nAlso, she has guided through all the parameters and specifically dietary habits which will keep both mother and baby health in control from the first trimester. My wife had developed gestational diabetes during the 2nd trimester which can lead to over weight of the baby and less possibility for a normal delivery. Therefore, she had advised us to workout, follow a perfect diet to control diabetes to maintain good mother and baby weight as well as to monitor blood sugar level periodically at home through which we had controlled blood sugar level.\n\nShe prescribed medicines, tests and follow-up week-by-week to monitor and develop good health for mother and baby, we just followed her foot-steps which had led to labor pain on the day when we had completed 38 weeks, and the delivery pain progressed very well. Though it was very painful for my wife, our doctor advised and strengthened us at timely to deliver our baby in a span of 3-4 hours without going for an epidural (painless method).\n\nShe treated and provided the best care when my wife had developed swelling and opening in the episiotomy area after delivery, also she asked us to do certain home treatments which really worked well and led to speedy recovery.\n\nThroughout, our experience with Dr. Yasmin Imdad was very great, safe, comfortable and satisfying in all the scenarios as we simply have to go with her guidance and treatments. We strongly recommend Dr. Yasmin Imdad with the best experience which we have had.\n\nDr. Yasmin Imdad, we sincerely thank you for caring, guiding and providing best care throughout and brought us to successful normal delivery as this was our first pregnancy and you have really made us very special. Thank you doctor :-)",

She was monitoring my sugar level on phone every alternate day. During the covid situation she was always available on phone and was clearing all doubts regarding labor pain. On the time of delivery my husband was not with me as he got dengue and admitted to different hospital but just because of Dr. Yasmin I took decision to deliver on planned date of delivery by induced labor method in Rainbow hospital. She informed other doctors about my situation and Delivery went very smooth. Post delivery I got fever, she took my case very seriously and monitored everything until I got discharge.

The very first interaction was so appealing that we were convinced that we were  in right hands and decided to stick with the doctor until delivery which eventually happened in July 2020 . Her friendliness, ability to hear out and provide right recommendations really makes her stands apart from others . We had made a request to doctor that we would like to normal delivery and she ensured that it happened despite of the fact that my wife became diabetic during pregnancy and child weight was on the higher side . Her timely diagnosis and right suggestions made the difference . The best part was her connect with the patient during the testing times because of covid situation , she remained available over phone watsapp for any queries .At last during the delivery day , she ensured that she is available for the delivery herself during mid night and kept following up with patient and duty doctors throughout her admission . I could not thank her enough for all she has done for us . I highly do recommend Yasmin Mam if you stay near ORR , marathalli or Whitefield and trust me you won't regret your decision . Thanks Anshu ",

In-fact, the reason I decided to consult her was her qualification (member of Royal college of obstetrician and gynecologist). After meeting her, I found her\u00a0patient friendly. She listens to patient and clearly explains the medical condition and treatment.\u00a0Qualification blended with humility makes her a wonderful doctor.I visited her for complete duration of pregnancy\u00a0till delivery and now for post delivery care. In the later phase of my pregnancy, I got\u00a0Intrahepatic\u00a0cholestasis of pregnancy and\u00a0Gestational diabetes\u00a0mellitus. She handled the situation with swift and confidence. She never gave a room for panic. Finally, I had a pre-term delivery and Doctor visited me in odd hours to make sure everything is going fine with me. She was continuously\u00a0in touch via phone/whatsapp during my hospitalization. Dr. performed c-section after non progressing labor on Diwali evening and I was bless with a baby. I was touched by her commitment as a Doctor.Thank you Dr Yashmin Ma'am. Thank you very much.",

Dr. Yasmin has years of experience and her way of dealing with patients atleast for us is something we are most grateful for.  ",

Apart from having expertise in her field, she is very polite, listens to and answers all the queries one may have with patience, no matter how silly the question is. She makes everything understandable in very simple words. It was only because of her patience and support that I could have a normal delivery. I was totally confident throughout my pregnancy that I was in safe hands and never had to seek any second opinion from anyone. Apart from this, she also involves the husband equally in all the discussions which is very important from a husband's perspective. In conclusion, I would blindly recommend her name to anyone seeking an OBGYN consultation in Bangalore.\nP.S. - She will always reply to your texts.",

She was reassuring and took excellent care as our baby arrived at full term. Even post that, she has never been hesitant to help us whenever we have a query or confusion.

From my first meeting itself I was struck by her calm demeanor and the way she explained all the details. She did not rush us and cleared every minor doubt. I faced a few health issues during the pregnancy but she was there every step of the way. During the lockdown I could not visit the hospital a few times but I never panicked because she was always available through phone calls and messages. I delivered a healthy baby boy through a planned caesarian in June 2020. She took equal care post delivery as well.",

As we faced the covid situation in the 2nd trimester we got scared to visit the hospital, but she was always available in WhatsApp to clarify our issues. So the covid didn't impact us much because of doctor's friendly behaviour. Since starting we told her that we want to opt for normal delivery. So she used to take care of each and every problem which didn't lead us to c-sec and we had a healthy normal delivery on June 2nd 2020 as she promised. We are really grateful to her for staying so long in labour room when my wife was facing difficulty to push the baby. After 3 months of delivery also she has not changed and like before she is helping us now over phone. Still our parents are not here due to covid situation, but she used to guide us every single doubt whenever we have which is really appreciable. She even considered our 1st trimester USA reports in our starting days of visits to her which usually other doctors ignored and suggested us to do the testing in their hospital for clear report. Overall we had a great and wonderful journey with Dr. Yashmin and we would love to visit her again if required.",
