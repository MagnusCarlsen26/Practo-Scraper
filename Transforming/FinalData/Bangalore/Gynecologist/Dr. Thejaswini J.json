From the very first visit to the last, Dr. Thejaswini has been an absolute godsend. Her dedication to her patients and her unwavering commitment to their well-being is truly remarkable.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dr. Thejaswini's warm and compassionate demeanor immediately puts patients at ease. She takes the time to listen attentively, addressing all concerns and questions with patience and empathy. This level of genuine care goes a long way in reducing the anxiety that often accompanies visits to a gynecologist.\n\nWhat sets Dr. Thejaswini apart is her exceptional ability to educate and empower her patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of my wife's treatment, making sure we fully understood the options and decisions ahead. This transparency was invaluable in helping us make informed choices regarding our healthcare.\n\nOne of Dr. Thejaswini's most remarkable qualities is her conscientious approach to medical care. She firmly believes in not prescribing unnecessary medicines or tests. She said \"You don't need a doctor; you need a dietician first,\" embodies her commitment to addressing the root causes of health issues rather than relying solely on medications. This approach demonstrates her dedication to the long-term health and well-being of her patients.\n\nThank you, Dr. Thejaswini, for being the incredible doctor that you are, and for making such a positive impact on our lives. \n\nRegards,\nNiyati and Ashwani",

The reason has nothing to do with her skill-set but since I had not known her before. But it didn\u2019t take time to change my mind and become very comfortable with her. She was ready to entertain all my doubts and queries about pregnancy. Unlike others without any hesitation, she shared her personal number to call her in case of need at odd hours. My first pregnancy tenure went on very smooth under her guidance. Upon her advice, my weight gain check and pre -natal yoga really helped to keep me fit till the very end. Her habit of checking the weight & pulse rate herself instead of a nurse gave a very personal feel n developed our bond stronger. During delivery, her constant encouragement helped me to get through the painful process of labour. Later it was my baby\u2019s decision to come by the c-section way. Dr. Thejaswini was confident, dedicated and absolutely skillful to operate on me . Under complications, I am absolutely thankful for a safe delivery of my beautiful daughter. Even after delivery, her routine checks used to add very friendly notes\u201d Stop wearing these hospital clothes, you are all fine, wear regular clothes\u201d! This really made me feel at home. Within a week I healed under her observation. Sharing my pregnancy experience after becoming a mother of 2 month baby now, all fit and fine . Indeed we are very grateful to this wonderful doctor! - Nandini , Himanshu and little one Sayee Suthar",

What a gem of person and professional ma\u2019am is. \n\nShe was consulting doctor through my wife\u2019s pregnancy and there was no one better I could\u2019ve wished for. Now I will tell my reason in the most layman\u2019s perspective \n\n1. Very grounded in her approach and would only make the necessary recommendation in terms of medicines or scans, so one can be assured if Dr has prescribed it then it is of utmost importance and not for the pharmacy or the scan clinics profits as sometimes people are apprehensive about.\n\n2. Listens and encourages you throughout your journey, without you ever feeling if she is rushing into things\n\n3. Approachable for people from all kinds of economic strata in the society.\n\n4. Will never hint at or even make a passing reference of C Section unless absolutely necessary, will encourage you and give your tips for natural delivery right from day 1.\n\n5. She helped us naturally deliver a healthy baby boy in Columbia Asia Sarjapur after my wife went in labour 24 hours after her water broke. She insisted on not going the c section route or even giving epidurals as she said that the vitals are all good and natural route is best one at this stage even when my wife said that the pain was unbearable, she held her hand and encouraged her to be the most comfortable position to push, which the nurse weren\u2019t allowing (squat position). \n\nThanks you Dr and May you be blessed with all the good health and fortune.",

She is ready to help in ODD hours over call or watsup. Hence I recommend Dr.Tejaswini so that I traveled from Tin factory to Electronics City for her consolation.\nOne Suggestion madam, if you have minimum required equipment in your clinic, it\u2019s so much better for patients, because some of the diagnostics center people not taking proper care and not clarifying doubts while scanning and any other tests. They are not ready to answer about patient queries. They are thinking, should finish appointments ASAP within less time.\nWe are really appreciate your attitude, care and patience for patients, Thank you so much madam for your support.\n- Vasavi, Subba Reddy",

This was the first time, I made use of PRACTO services or check-up related to my wife in Bangalore. I had nice experience with my previous doctor at hometown based in UP earlier.\nI decided to make a visit to this clinic after checking reviews online in Practo. But, I found the scenario very different post the visit. I booked appointment for 7:20 PM for 5 Jan 2019; however, I received a call from clinic on same day in afternoon that doctor would come late and so, they rescheduled my appointment for 8:20 PM. I reached clinic at 8:05 PM and found that doctor was already there. Receptionist told that my appointment was for 7:20 PM not for 8:20. Due to this, I waited till 9:45 PM because a lot of patients were there in queue, but I believed that if my appointment was rescheduled properly, I didn't have to wait for long there.\nSecondly, I found some sort of aggression within the doctor. I usually found the doctor in hurry and for this, she didn't exhibit much concern/cooperation for our problems. \nI usually have a habit to ask questions with doctors, but literally I didn't find much encouragement from the doctor's side. I understand that in pregnancy, a lot of questions are there which a normal person won't appreciate but anyhow, it is doctor's responsibility to encourage the patients for asking questions. Obviously, this was missing from the doctor's side. \n\nPros:\n\n1. The doctor prescribed some tests there, which I found correct as per the situation.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Wait time was literally very high\n2. Doctor friendliness was very limited. (I found the doctor with a lot of attitude)\n3. Doctor cooperation was very limited\n4. Doctor was reluctant, most often, answering questions I made.\n4. They are charging consultation fee for every visit\nOn 5th Jan '19, they charged 300/- and on 7th Jan '19 they charged 50/-; though, it is a minimal amount but I never found it with other doctors. There should be time period made by clinic/hospital in which consultation fees should be chargeable.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned reasons, I decided not to make any further visit to this clinic again. I'm sorry, but I didn't find any further reason to appreciate anything about the doctor or clinic.\n\nThanks.",

Whenever I visited her for my check-ups she only spoke to the point my consultation did not last for more than 15mins throughout my visits . No friendly conversation nothing on a personal level . As I was a first time mother & new to motherhood no proper guidance or help. On suggesting that we will need her phone number at some time as I was nearing delivery she gave us a blunt reply & indirectly mentioned that she is not interested in giving her number which is anyway acceptable as they are doctors and receive lot of calls but the way she spoke to us was not courteous. Postpartum she did not recommend me to take my regular supplements ***** * ****** **** ***** * ** ************* * ** *** ** *** ******** *** *** ** *** * ** ******* **** *** ***** * *** ****** **** *** ******** ** *** * ** ** **** ** ** **** **** *** *** ********* ******* *** *** ***** * She only keeps herself to her work & is not interested in a friendly conversation with the patient",

I have been visiting her since the beginning of my pregnancy and chose to stick to the end because of the excellent approach and support I got from her. She used to explain all my queries and doubts in a very polite and detailed manner. I never felt dissatisfied anytime I had to visit her- whether it be recommended medicines, procedures, any external examination, any routine checkups or even recommendations for the pregnancy tests I had to undergo. She made my entire pregnancy journey so smooth and I felt so assured from within that I am in safe hands. This trust got firmer when I had an emergency during last stage of my pregnancy and I was worried that I will get a C. I could have never imagined that with a case like PROM she can be so calm, supportive and not scare us (especially having heard  all the stories from my colleagues about their PROM cases). She calmly assured me that she will first try for normal and fortunately so was the case. Her positive smile sets all things right for people like us and brings rest to all our anxieties.",

Initially I was not sure whether I would continue with her or not but after few days I was very comfortable and decided that it would be her to do my delivery. There are no unnecessary tests or medications advised.Through out pregnancy, she has been very supportive, approachable and and always have heard if there were any doubts and concerns and also her patience is highly appreciated. I had a normal delivery and something that I noticed was Dr never spoke of C-section or even mentioned about it any point, only thing she suggested was do regular exercises, so that it would help during delivery. So it's not that all doctors suggest C-section, atleast not in case of Dr Tejaswini, unless it's a need depending on patients health condition and baby's position.Post pregnancy care was also extremely good. I had developed breast absses post devilery and she went out of her way to get my dressing done and make sure the absses would heal faster. Would highly recommend Dr Tejaswini and be assured you are with the right Dr.Thank you Dr for all your help, It has been a very pleasant experience.",

Never scares you and doesnt provide unnecessary medicines. Responds to queries over phone or whatsapp too.  I suffered from hypermesis gravidarum(extreme vomiting) during my pregnancy and had to get hospitalized twice. Doctor handled it very carefully and consulted other doctors too to rule out any other digestive issues. She suggested me to go to my native place and it worked for me like a charm. During my hospital stay she used to encourage me so much to look good and feel good, always telling me that I was not a patient. I was losing weight previously during pregnancy but after her suggestion of moving to my native, I was able to gain weight too and was able to control my vomiting. At 36 weeks ultrasound I found that the baby had two loops of cord around his neck and was worried that I might have to go for c-sec. Everyone I told was sure that I'll have to opt for surgery. When I discussed this with doc, she was so calm and made me comfortable telling its not necessary to go for surgery and  she'll try for normal. Finally I delivered normally under her supervision. The entire delivery process was so smooth and she was  so encouraging throughout. Thank you so much Ma'am.",

Review of the clinic: No proper seating capacity. I believe only 10-12 chairs were there which were already filled up. My question is if any patient with pregnancy visits that place, is she supposed to stand all the time and wait in case seats are not available?Sanitation of the place was not up to the mark. The placed looked very dirty, dark, gloomy and very suffocating. The AC was also not working well. No proper mechanism to track who is entering doctor\u2019s chamber. People were coming and entering the doctor\u2019s chamber as per their wish. When I went to check with the receptionist, they had no clue of what's happening.Now coming to what happened on the day of the appointment.I had booked an appointment for a slot of 5-30 PM and reached the place at dot 5-30 PM. To my utter surprise, after reaching there my wife\u2019s name was written in a register and it was after 5-6 people who were already present there. On asking the staff that we have a Practo booking of 5-30 PM, they insisted us to wait till those patients were done with their consultations. Then I questioned them that what was the point of a prior booking to which they said they cant help it and that's the \u201cprocess\u201d. After waiting for 15-20 more minutes, I again went and checked with them about the status. This time they even stopped responding to me which was not at all a gentleman\u2019s gesture. Looking at all this, I tried questioning them further but without any satisfactory answer. I even called at Practo customer care where the customer care executive heard my concerns and asked me to handover the phone to the receptionist. But, they simply refused to speak to the customer care executive. The staff and even the doctor misbehaved with me and spoke in a loud tone pointing fingers at us. I am really saddened to see such things happening at a place where sensitive things like childbirth, gynae problems and motherhood are handled. Would request Team Practo to listen to my petition and take strict action on this place, the staff and the doctor.Thank you again for hearing me out!",

From the very first visit to the last, Dr. Thejaswini has been an absolute godsend. Her dedication to her patients and her unwavering commitment to their well-being is truly remarkable.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dr. Thejaswini's warm and compassionate demeanor immediately puts patients at ease. She takes the time to listen attentively, addressing all concerns and questions with patience and empathy. This level of genuine care goes a long way in reducing the anxiety that often accompanies visits to a gynecologist.\n\nWhat sets Dr. Thejaswini apart is her exceptional ability to educate and empower her patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of my wife's treatment, making sure we fully understood the options and decisions ahead. This transparency was invaluable in helping us make informed choices regarding our healthcare.\n\nOne of Dr. Thejaswini's most remarkable qualities is her conscientious approach to medical care. She firmly believes in not prescribing unnecessary medicines or tests. She said \"You don't need a doctor; you need a dietician first,\" embodies her commitment to addressing the root causes of health issues rather than relying solely on medications. This approach demonstrates her dedication to the long-term health and well-being of her patients.\n\nThank you, Dr. Thejaswini, for being the incredible doctor that you are, and for making such a positive impact on our lives. \n\nRegards,\nNiyati and Ashwani",

The reason has nothing to do with her skill-set but since I had not known her before. But it didn\u2019t take time to change my mind and become very comfortable with her. She was ready to entertain all my doubts and queries about pregnancy. Unlike others without any hesitation, she shared her personal number to call her in case of need at odd hours. My first pregnancy tenure went on very smooth under her guidance. Upon her advice, my weight gain check and pre -natal yoga really helped to keep me fit till the very end. Her habit of checking the weight & pulse rate herself instead of a nurse gave a very personal feel n developed our bond stronger. During delivery, her constant encouragement helped me to get through the painful process of labour. Later it was my baby\u2019s decision to come by the c-section way. Dr. Thejaswini was confident, dedicated and absolutely skillful to operate on me . Under complications, I am absolutely thankful for a safe delivery of my beautiful daughter. Even after delivery, her routine checks used to add very friendly notes\u201d Stop wearing these hospital clothes, you are all fine, wear regular clothes\u201d! This really made me feel at home. Within a week I healed under her observation. Sharing my pregnancy experience after becoming a mother of 2 month baby now, all fit and fine . Indeed we are very grateful to this wonderful doctor! - Nandini , Himanshu and little one Sayee Suthar",

What a gem of person and professional ma\u2019am is. \n\nShe was consulting doctor through my wife\u2019s pregnancy and there was no one better I could\u2019ve wished for. Now I will tell my reason in the most layman\u2019s perspective \n\n1. Very grounded in her approach and would only make the necessary recommendation in terms of medicines or scans, so one can be assured if Dr has prescribed it then it is of utmost importance and not for the pharmacy or the scan clinics profits as sometimes people are apprehensive about.\n\n2. Listens and encourages you throughout your journey, without you ever feeling if she is rushing into things\n\n3. Approachable for people from all kinds of economic strata in the society.\n\n4. Will never hint at or even make a passing reference of C Section unless absolutely necessary, will encourage you and give your tips for natural delivery right from day 1.\n\n5. She helped us naturally deliver a healthy baby boy in Columbia Asia Sarjapur after my wife went in labour 24 hours after her water broke. She insisted on not going the c section route or even giving epidurals as she said that the vitals are all good and natural route is best one at this stage even when my wife said that the pain was unbearable, she held her hand and encouraged her to be the most comfortable position to push, which the nurse weren\u2019t allowing (squat position). \n\nThanks you Dr and May you be blessed with all the good health and fortune.",

They are not ready to answer about patient queries. They are thinking, should finish appointments ASAP within less time.\nWe are really appreciate your attitude, care and patience for patients, Thank you so much madam for your support.\n- Vasavi, Subba Reddy",

This was the first time, I made use of PRACTO services or check-up related to my wife in Bangalore. I had nice experience with my previous doctor at hometown based in UP earlier.\nI decided to make a visit to this clinic after checking reviews online in Practo. But, I found the scenario very different post the visit. I booked appointment for 7:20 PM for 5 Jan 2019; however, I received a call from clinic on same day in afternoon that doctor would come late and so, they rescheduled my appointment for 8:20 PM. I reached clinic at 8:05 PM and found that doctor was already there. Receptionist told that my appointment was for 7:20 PM not for 8:20. Due to this, I waited till 9:45 PM because a lot of patients were there in queue, but I believed that if my appointment was rescheduled properly, I didn't have to wait for long there.\nSecondly, I found some sort of aggression within the doctor. I usually found the doctor in hurry and for this, she didn't exhibit much concern/cooperation for our problems. \nI usually have a habit to ask questions with doctors, but literally I didn't find much encouragement from the doctor's side. I understand that in pregnancy, a lot of questions are there which a normal person won't appreciate but anyhow, it is doctor's responsibility to encourage the patients for asking questions. Obviously, this was missing from the doctor's side. \n\nPros:\n\n1. The doctor prescribed some tests there, which I found correct as per the situation.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Wait time was literally very high\n2. Doctor friendliness was very limited. (I found the doctor with a lot of attitude)\n3. Doctor cooperation was very limited\n4. Doctor was reluctant, most often, answering questions I made.\n4. They are charging consultation fee for every visit\nOn 5th Jan '19, they charged 300/- and on 7th Jan '19 they charged 50/-; though, it is a minimal amount but I never found it with other doctors. There should be time period made by clinic/hospital in which consultation fees should be chargeable.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned reasons, I decided not to make any further visit to this clinic again. I'm sorry, but I didn't find any further reason to appreciate anything about the doctor or clinic.\n\nThanks.",

As I was a first time mother & new to motherhood no proper guidance or help. On suggesting that we will need her phone number at some time as I was nearing delivery she gave us a blunt reply & indirectly mentioned that she is not interested in giving her number which is anyway acceptable as they are doctors and receive lot of calls but the way she spoke to us was not courteous.

I have been visiting her since the beginning of my pregnancy and chose to stick to the end because of the excellent approach and support I got from her. She used to explain all my queries and doubts in a very polite and detailed manner. I never felt dissatisfied anytime I had to visit her- whether it be recommended medicines, procedures, any external examination, any routine checkups or even recommendations for the pregnancy tests I had to undergo. She made my entire pregnancy journey so smooth and I felt so assured from within that I am in safe hands. This trust got firmer when I had an emergency during last stage of my pregnancy and I was worried that I will get a C. I could have never imagined that with a case like PROM she can be so calm, supportive and not scare us (especially having heard  all the stories from my colleagues about their PROM cases). She calmly assured me that she will first try for normal and fortunately so was the case. Her positive smile sets all things right for people like us and brings rest to all our anxieties.",

Initially I was not sure whether I would continue with her or not but after few days I was very comfortable and decided that it would be her to do my delivery. There are no unnecessary tests or medications advised.Through out pregnancy, she has been very supportive, approachable and and always have heard if there were any doubts and concerns and also her patience is highly appreciated. I had a normal delivery and something that I noticed was Dr never spoke of C-section or even mentioned about it any point, only thing she suggested was do regular exercises, so that it would help during delivery. So it's not that all doctors suggest C-section, atleast not in case of Dr Tejaswini, unless it's a need depending on patients health condition and baby's position.Post pregnancy care was also extremely good. I had developed breast absses post devilery and she went out of her way to get my dressing done and make sure the absses would heal faster. Would highly recommend Dr Tejaswini and be assured you are with the right Dr.Thank you Dr for all your help, It has been a very pleasant experience.",

Never scares you and doesnt provide unnecessary medicines. Responds to queries over phone or whatsapp too.  I suffered from hypermesis gravidarum(extreme vomiting) during my pregnancy and had to get hospitalized twice. Doctor handled it very carefully and consulted other doctors too to rule out any other digestive issues. She suggested me to go to my native place and it worked for me like a charm. During my hospital stay she used to encourage me so much to look good and feel good, always telling me that I was not a patient. I was losing weight previously during pregnancy but after her suggestion of moving to my native, I was able to gain weight too and was able to control my vomiting. At 36 weeks ultrasound I found that the baby had two loops of cord around his neck and was worried that I might have to go for c-sec. Everyone I told was sure that I'll have to opt for surgery. When I discussed this with doc, she was so calm and made me comfortable telling its not necessary to go for surgery and  she'll try for normal. Finally I delivered normally under her supervision. The entire delivery process was so smooth and she was  so encouraging throughout. Thank you so much Ma'am.",

Review of the clinic: No proper seating capacity. I believe only 10-12 chairs were there which were already filled up. My question is if any patient with pregnancy visits that place, is she supposed to stand all the time and wait in case seats are not available?Sanitation of the place was not up to the mark. The placed looked very dirty, dark, gloomy and very suffocating. The AC was also not working well. No proper mechanism to track who is entering doctor\u2019s chamber. People were coming and entering the doctor\u2019s chamber as per their wish. When I went to check with the receptionist, they had no clue of what's happening.Now coming to what happened on the day of the appointment.I had booked an appointment for a slot of 5-30 PM and reached the place at dot 5-30 PM. To my utter surprise, after reaching there my wife\u2019s name was written in a register and it was after 5-6 people who were already present there. On asking the staff that we have a Practo booking of 5-30 PM, they insisted us to wait till those patients were done with their consultations. Then I questioned them that what was the point of a prior booking to which they said they cant help it and that's the \u201cprocess\u201d. After waiting for 15-20 more minutes, I again went and checked with them about the status. This time they even stopped responding to me which was not at all a gentleman\u2019s gesture. Looking at all this, I tried questioning them further but without any satisfactory answer. I even called at Practo customer care where the customer care executive heard my concerns and asked me to handover the phone to the receptionist. But, they simply refused to speak to the customer care executive. The staff and even the doctor misbehaved with me and spoke in a loud tone pointing fingers at us. I am really saddened to see such things happening at a place where sensitive things like childbirth, gynae problems and motherhood are handled. Would request Team Practo to listen to my petition and take strict action on this place, the staff and the doctor.Thank you again for hearing me out!",

When we shifted we were confused and worried as well about selecting our new gynick as we can't continue our old doctor becoz it was too far from here.Then we heard about dr Tejashawani and went to her clinic with lots of doubt in mind. But as soon as our first consultation we became very confident that we are in safe hand. She is very polite, confident and kind too.she heard all my issue/concern with patience.Then we decided to continue with her only.As soon as my delivery date was reaching i was getting scared and nervous. In my all meeting with dr. I use to request dr. I want her to be with me during my delivery and she use to assure. And during my delivery she really reached on time and was with me all d time which increases my confidence  and increased my ability to bear pain as we were trying for normal delivey.but due to some complication i had c-section but I never felt nervous.

She is so polite and compassionate to the extent that even if she made you wait for a couple or more hours due to her busy schedule, you won't' mind. She's quick to apologize too if she's out for an emergency. She is always available on call. \n\nI consulted her for pregnancy related issues.

I visited her for my Maternity check up & Pregnancy consultations. The way she explained and handled my all check up was really appreciable. She has been extremely professional, polite, humble, kind, and took extreme care of me through the whole pregnancy. She was calm and confident through out my all visits till delivery. She mentioned that she just wanted to give us a healthy baby, and my husband and I are grateful for the beautiful little healthy baby boy we have now. She encouraged for normal delivery and we were blessed to get the baby delivered by her at OT. I will highly recommend her for all the patients. Thanks you so much doctor. ",

She repeated vitamin D tablet's to my wife and didn't even check the report where in earlier she had prescribed the same. Also no advice as to pregnancy care. We only have to ask. She gave a diet chart and didn't even explain about it properly. I feel it's waste of time and money going to such doctors and such a hospital. Have shifted to Apollo cradle under wonderful gynac. I couldn't believe this doctor practices at Apollo cradle as well. I don't know where she works. Won't refer anyone to go here.",

She is extremely professional, polite, humble, kind,  and takes extreme care of the patient through the whole pregnancy. We went with a previous history of a miscarriage and Dr Tejaswini took extra precaution and patiently explained to us at every visit,  what she was doing and why. She was calm and confident through out as well.  She mentioned that she just wants to give us a healthy baby,  and we are grateful for the beautiful little healthy baby boy we now have,  all thanks to her. Through the delivery as well,  she just kept encouraging and motivating us and keeping the whole atmosphere positive. A wonderful doctor and we are just grateful to have had her as our doctor. ",

She listens to patients concern completely before trying to suggest thus assisting in root causing the problem accurately. She starts off with the basic treatment and common cases and if the issue persists then only she will advice you to get into advanced level tests and treatments which eradicates the un-neccessary costs and time incurred.\nHer knowledge is immense and her attitude is down to earth. She is ready to answer to any of your basic to basic questions which helps patients to comfortably share their queries and get clarified. I have also seen her the way she explains to one of her uneducated patient. Doctor was boosting her confidence and taking time and explaining her every aspect with patience so that the future mom was feeling so comfortable just like how her baby was feeling in her womb.\n\nI was having pregnancy problem after consulting this doctor I got pregnancy and we are continuing to her consultation now during pregnancy.\n\nThank you so much Doctor.

However, the situation was well managed by the Doctor and she finally delivered my baby girl via C-Section. All the time she was with the patient, ignoring all her personal errands.\nShe is truly a Godsend. Thank you doctor for all your efforts.\nWe realize that there are some efforts that money cannot buy and hence thus feedback was due.\n",

But we need to take receipts again in the hospital for checkup which makes more delay, if we booked in online 4:30pm and we went to hospital by 4pm people who booked for 7pm will come by 3:50pm and they will take receipt first and really sad we need to wait almost 2to 3hours.\n\nreceptionist is not well on his duty  need to perform at least his job. He simple gives slips not even checks which number going In and which number is coming out. I suggest at least  he need to call for next number when someone comes out.",

During the entire pregnancy she supported my wife with all the proper medications and did not take any risks. Even at the time if delivery, she guided so well. My wife had complications post delivery around midnight and doctor turned up in few minutes to control the situation. She continuosly monitored her for 48 hours and did all her best to control any further complication. We are now blessed with a baby. I would definitely recommend her. She is very polite and really very caring. Thank you so much mam.",

I heard from most of the people that after c section minimum 1wk it will be paining. And it will be difficult even to walk or get up. My experience was completely opposite. From 3rd day I was able to walk without anyone's support. And I never felt any pain on the stitches. On my last meeting when she told I don't need to visit again I felt like one big support I am going to miss.\nMy pregnancy journey was great with doctor Tejaswini. ",

Unfortunately, we had to undergo a termination but Dr. Thejaswini was completely understanding and sensitive towards the situation, specially as she made me feel guilt free of the mishap.\nShe is quite friendly and approachable. It was appreciable how she promptly responds over phone and messages and ensures the problem, cause and remedy is well explained.\nAn year later, we consulted her as I had conceived and understably we were worried but she instilled hope and guided us through the pregnancy smoothly and thanks to her we were blessed with a baby boy with a normal delivery recently :)",

Ultrasound tests were conducted on regular basis to check development of the baby. She also gave ample time for baby to turn from breech position so that a normal delivery might be conducted. Finally, a c-section was done given the baby didn't turn and it was completed without any complications. Happy with the overall experience & me and my wife will forever be in gratitude for her services.",
