,,0,0,YES,We met Dr Geetha at Belenus Hospital at the time of 28 weeks of pregnancy. Since ours is twin pregnancy in single sack there was many complications and instead of going for delivery at 28 weeks Dr Geetha had reviewed previous reports and insisted frequent monitoring with weekly scan & medication. Thereafter we have travelled till 34.5 weeks and delivered healthy twin girl babies. I would recommend Dr Geetha for OBG & Gyn as she is one of the best in treating patients by being transparent by answering all our doubts and queries in a polite manner.,2024-06-03 10:34:17,False,True,Ranjith R,,,
