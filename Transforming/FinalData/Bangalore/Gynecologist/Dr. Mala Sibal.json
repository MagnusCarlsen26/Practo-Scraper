Though, I told my problem to the PR staff and luckily got an appointment for aminocentesis. I got my 20 weeks anamoly scan done at diagonistic center and the report says that 20 weeks fetus has short nasal bone, which is a strong indicator for down syndrome. Then, i decided to go for aminocentesis procedure to know whether baby has down syndrome or not. Dr. Mala Sibal did the procedure well, without any pain. Even i didn't get to know when the procedure started and when it ended up. I was completely blown away by how experienced and knowledgle she is and how fast she has done the procedure, most importantly without any pain. I got the procedure done on 27th Jan and on 29 th Jan got the report for FISH test, which says chromosomes 21,18, and 13 all are normal. I am so happy after getting the procedure done Dr. Mala Sibal. She is really knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable throughout the procedure and counselling. She gave me extra time and attention, more than expected. I would highly recommend this doctor. She is extremely intelligent, a compassionate and caring person ,and a truly outstanding doctor. I count myself truly lucky to have found her. \r\nI would like to thank her and just wanted to share with her that everything is normal in FISH test.",
