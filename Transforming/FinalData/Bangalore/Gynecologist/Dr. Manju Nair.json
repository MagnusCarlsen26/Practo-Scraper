It\u2019s a great honor and privileged to share my opinion. We find ourselves fortunate to have been associated. it's hard to pick an English word expressing my thankfulness for Doctor. I can't limit myself just saying Thanks and close this Feedback. I don't think I can pay off Doctor's help in my tenure in any manner, but I will grab every opportunity.\n\nAs the AGE is advancing, Pressure is mounting drastically. Tried almost everything in the WORLD with a variety of treatments but failed successfully. On the other side, we have all the problems like endometriosis, Hydrosalpinx, Fibroid, and whatnot. It's not quite easy for any doctor to handle such complex cases to bring a solution unless she a great doctor who is highly knowledgeable on their domain with abundant experience. That's Manju Nair. She looks very simple but a Giant on infertility treatments with her miraculous hand. it's challenging for any doctor to derive a solution in such complex cases with all these multiple problems. She breaks all the barriers and opened each tangle nicely with her patent protocols. Simply a woman with mission. \n\nBefore I approached Manju Doctor, I had done a thorough investigation for a long time and received 100% positive feedback and considered my last destination afterward. She is not just a doctor who merely treats their patients but also a great solution to your potential problem. What a sense of fulfilment and culmination at the end. Every moment of joy we experience today is because of the Doctor. I don\u2019t know where we would be without her.\n\nI still remember one day Madam was a bit emotional and I was deeply touched by her determination to see me as a parent. Madam knew everything about her Patients and emotional bonding is established at the moment you meet her and do not forget that Madam is masters in memory management. Trust me there would not be any failure once you are in the capable hands of Doctor Manju Nair.\n\nAmazing staff with a high tolerance of people, to name a few\u2026 Kavitha & Veera & Soumya sisters. What wonderful persons they are with high commitment values. I would say They are the real assets for any organization to Grow. We appreciate cloud nine for deputing such a motivated expert workforce.\n\nLast but not least, Cloudnine has done its excellence with a generous mix of both technology and clinical expertise to ensure that all their customers have an exquisite, safe and joyous experience in this beautiful journey.

We consulted with a lot of fertility clinics, most of them were manipulative . They had scared us with suggesting wrong diagnosis and lengthy treatments which would have costed us in a significant manner . This suggestion of wrong diagnosis caused us so much of mental agony and anxiety.  We got to know about Dr.Manju Nair and decided to consult her. During our initial visit her assistant took all our details, noted down all the important points. Dr.Manju Nair went through our file in detail and then heard us patiently, when she understood what we had been through she immediately did a scan at the clinic , during the scan she explained in detail what she observed and discarded all the previous diagnosis suggested by other clinics. She told us to start the treatment on a specific date and convinced with her eye for detail we went ahead with her recommendation . During the treatment she was very precise as to what has to be done and explained in detail as to why she is recommending a specific medication , she was very professional throughout the treatment. After trying for 6 years to conceive and going through an emotional roller coaster ride, by God\u2019s grace we got the good news with the first attempt of IVF with Dr. Manju Nair . Even after the positive result she proceeded with caution , recommended medication and emphasised on taking rest for the right amount of time. We would highly recommend Dr.Manju Nair to all the couples who want to receive the right guidance and treatment .",

There is an old saying that \"Doctors are second to God on this earth\". \nThe said became true when we meat Dr Manju Nair and the team at Cloud Nine, Fertility Cetnre in OAR. Thank you would be very small for the miracle that Manju madam has given us.\nOur infertility journey was long of more than 5 yrears. During these struggling years, we lost hope. After meeting with Manju Madam and the team, the impossible word in our life became possible. She is such a busy doctor handling so many patients still she shared her number with and took time to respond to our queries over whatsapp. She will never suggest for any unnecessary tests unless it's very much required.\nShe knows what are the doubts most patients deal with and she will clear them all before even you ask her. She not only makes us feel comfortable with her friendly approach but gives us a clear direction on the way forward.\nThe entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. She has an excellent team of embryologists and they gave us regular progress updates without follow up. Her team of nurses and assistants are always well briefed by her for all critical steps for her patients. Now, with her blessings and support, My wife is pregnant of 3 months. \nWe would like to thank again to Dr Manju Nair for making the miracle happen. Our sincier thanks to Kavita sister and the team for helping us in each step of our journey. We pray to god for the good health and prosperity for Manju Madam and the entire Team.",

We are obviously very happy. But my feedback here is factual so that it's helpful for people like us. We didn't get the information without the unpleasant experience\nShe is very professional and thorough doctor. In the first meeting itself we told her that time is crucial for us as we had already wasted a lot of time. She explained us that the process with her will have to be step wise, but promised us that we will conceive within this year (it was June'2020) and it happened :)\nWe had seen 3 other hospitals and doctors. They were either experimenting with us or were new in the field. We wasted money, efforts and most importantly time.\nOur experience with Dr Manju Nair was fabulous. Firstly she wouldn't proceed further if she has doubts about the body preparation, (which lacked at other places, as they gave extra medicines to compensate for it) Secondly, for fertility the embryologist team plays a very important role. Dr Nair does only blastocyst transfer that was another factor which gave us confidence. She has an excellent team of embryologists and they gave us regular progress updates without follow up. Her team of nurses and assistants are always well briefed by her for all critical steps for her patients. I would get calls to initiate the injection and scans if those were the deciding factors for the next step\nOur FET procedure was smooth. The briefing for medicines and other instructions was done well right after. Infact, my injections and medicines were also optimal. (Unlike in my experience in other hospitals)\nWe are now pregnant with twins and in our first trimester :)\nOur heartfelt thanks to Dr.Manju!",

In my personal experience which I wanted to share, I was actually undergoing treatments in various hospitals and with different doctors. Nothing worked out, after sometime I even tried Homeo and Siddha for a change but everything went in vain for almost 09 years of all treatment. Later I was referred to Dr.Manju Nair through someone.  Dr.Manju Nair a person with  very Pure Soul , Very kind heart , helping , caring , Friendly, very Supportive , Positive vibes, right Guidance in all the ways like diet , reducing weight , Counseling and bring our mind to the positive side. I can say more than us she belived in her service and treatment to give success and make us parents to see us happy with kids. And that happened, Yes we were a proud Parents for a cute twins after 09 years of Marriage from now.  I really didn\u2019t know a Doctor can bring so much good thing and add happiness in someone\u2019s life especially mine. I really fascinate a doctor\u2019s profession looking at her service and dedication to work she shows. I can also say my wish is to make my Kids also to become like Dr.Manju Nair and serve for the society and for the people who were going through tough and difficulty times in their personal life. A life is not meant only for family, money, entertainment, luxury life, personal goals etc\u2026 A life is meant for doing good things to people and for the coming younger Generations. I can say she is an example for it.  A big thank you to Dr.Manju Nair from the bottom of my heart. I would have gone worse if I wouldn\u2019t have met her. Luckily by God\u2019s blessings I Met Dr.Manju Nair.",

She not only makes you feel comfortable with her friendly approach but gives you a clear direction on the way forward. It is never a monologue with her and she always involves your views and opinion at every step. \n\nShe has seen it all but still makes you feel genuinely special and your concerns important. She is direct and transparent in her treatment methods, feedback, and outcome with no false promises or sugar-coating. Despite a hectic continuous barrage of patients and procedures, Dr. Manju never fails to greet you with a genuine smile.\n\nWhat is most important during this treatment phase is patience and persistence which she always advises. It is amazing how she remembers the case & status of every single patient even after several months. When we visited her, we had no issues with fertility but possible age factors prevented pregnancies from going through. She was hand-holding us throughout the phase and the never-give-up attitude from both the doctor and our side is the reason why my pregnancy went through dispute phases where hope was almost lost.\n\nAnother major + point is that for every small query/concern we need not rush to the hospital because Dr. Manju or the nursing staff would quickly clarify this via WhatsApp or phone call. This is such a boon because other hospitals would ask you to email the query or visit them and pay consulting fee just to ask the doctor about some reaction to a particular medicine!\n\nDue to high demand and morning IUI procedures, it is often that you have 15-45mins of waiting time beyond your schedule. So please plan the visit duration accordingly. If one can not have the patience to wait for a consultation, it makes the entire journey even more stressful.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Manju Nair and the extremely friendly nursing & front-desk staff who were all supportive during the whole journey.  We are grateful to have found such a wonderful person and support staff at Cloud 9 OAR center Bangalore",

Dr. Manju is rare combination of assertiveness, *** ***** ********** skills, positivity , patience , confidence and Magic in her hands! \nThis place has made our dream come true . \nWith the history of 3 problematic pregnancies( 1 chemical , 2 ectopics - one ended up in emergency surgery ) , I was dreadful at the thought of pregnancy itself. But maternal instincts in a women are stronger than her fear for her life .  After a period of recuperation,  I gathered my strength and decided to visit cloud nine fertility. It\u2019s  only after I entered  the clinic , I realised I am not alone. I the met  doctor and she was so positive and confident  that she assured me that everything will be fine.\nAnd then my IVF journey started ! What an amazing journey it was!  Dr. Manju first put me on diet which I followed and lost 3 kgs in months ( I have been struggling with weight issues and never lost a single inch  inspite of trying hard previously )\nThen the process of IVF itself was very meticulous one. Very close and regular evaluation of the growth of follicles was performed by doctor Manju. The entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. Also the Anesthesiologist,  *************  ** ***** **** *** *** **** ******* *** *** best at their work . Dr. Manju\u2019s  team of sisters ( Kavitha , Soumya, Nethra , Jaya and Rosy) are very patient ,empathetic and professional . They know in and out of the process  and will make sure every treatment happens on the stipulated time .The lady help  inside of OT ( I am not aware of her name ) Is a very kind women  too. With the team\u2019s dedicated efforts,  I am now in the  second month pregnancy. Dr took extra care to ensure that all was well this time. No words can express our gratitude towards her. \nIn all, Dr Manju is the best doctor. She is an angel to all aspiring parents. Just trust her blindly , you won\u2019t be disappointed. . \nIf you are  still anxious, my only advice is : \nKeep Calm! It\u2019s  Dr. Manju Nair ! \n",

It\u2019s a great honor and privileged to share my opinion. We find ourselves fortunate to have been associated. it's hard to pick an English word expressing my thankfulness for Doctor. I can't limit myself just saying Thanks and close this Feedback. I don't think I can pay off Doctor's help in my tenure in any manner, but I will grab every opportunity.\n\nAs the AGE is advancing, Pressure is mounting drastically. Tried almost everything in the WORLD with a variety of treatments but failed successfully. On the other side, we have all the problems like endometriosis, Hydrosalpinx, Fibroid, and whatnot. It's not quite easy for any doctor to handle such complex cases to bring a solution unless she a great doctor who is highly knowledgeable on their domain with abundant experience. That's Manju Nair. She looks very simple but a Giant on infertility treatments with her miraculous hand. it's challenging for any doctor to derive a solution in such complex cases with all these multiple problems. She breaks all the barriers and opened each tangle nicely with her patent protocols. Simply a woman with mission. \n\nBefore I approached Manju Doctor, I had done a thorough investigation for a long time and received 100% positive feedback and considered my last destination afterward. She is not just a doctor who merely treats their patients but also a great solution to your potential problem. What a sense of fulfilment and culmination at the end. Every moment of joy we experience today is because of the Doctor. I don\u2019t know where we would be without her.\n\nI still remember one day Madam was a bit emotional and I was deeply touched by her determination to see me as a parent. Madam knew everything about her Patients and emotional bonding is established at the moment you meet her and do not forget that Madam is masters in memory management. Trust me there would not be any failure once you are in the capable hands of Doctor Manju Nair.\n\nAmazing staff with a high tolerance of people, to name a few\u2026 Kavitha & Veera & Soumya sisters. What wonderful persons they are with high commitment values. I would say They are the real assets for any organization to Grow. We appreciate cloud nine for deputing such a motivated expert workforce.\n\nLast but not least, Cloudnine has done its excellence with a generous mix of both technology and clinical expertise to ensure that all their customers have an exquisite, safe and joyous experience in this beautiful journey.

We consulted with a lot of fertility clinics, most of them were manipulative . They had scared us with suggesting wrong diagnosis and lengthy treatments which would have costed us in a significant manner . This suggestion of wrong diagnosis caused us so much of mental agony and anxiety.  We got to know about Dr.Manju Nair and decided to consult her. During our initial visit her assistant took all our details, noted down all the important points. Dr.Manju Nair went through our file in detail and then heard us patiently, when she understood what we had been through she immediately did a scan at the clinic , during the scan she explained in detail what she observed and discarded all the previous diagnosis suggested by other clinics. She told us to start the treatment on a specific date and convinced with her eye for detail we went ahead with her recommendation . During the treatment she was very precise as to what has to be done and explained in detail as to why she is recommending a specific medication , she was very professional throughout the treatment. After trying for 6 years to conceive and going through an emotional roller coaster ride, by God\u2019s grace we got the good news with the first attempt of IVF with Dr. Manju Nair . Even after the positive result she proceeded with caution , recommended medication and emphasised on taking rest for the right amount of time. We would highly recommend Dr.Manju Nair to all the couples who want to receive the right guidance and treatment .",

There is an old saying that \"Doctors are second to God on this earth\". \nThe said became true when we meat Dr Manju Nair and the team at Cloud Nine, Fertility Cetnre in OAR. Thank you would be very small for the miracle that Manju madam has given us.\nOur infertility journey was long of more than 5 yrears. During these struggling years, we lost hope. After meeting with Manju Madam and the team, the impossible word in our life became possible. She is such a busy doctor handling so many patients still she shared her number with and took time to respond to our queries over whatsapp. She will never suggest for any unnecessary tests unless it's very much required.\nShe knows what are the doubts most patients deal with and she will clear them all before even you ask her. She not only makes us feel comfortable with her friendly approach but gives us a clear direction on the way forward.\nThe entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. She has an excellent team of embryologists and they gave us regular progress updates without follow up. Her team of nurses and assistants are always well briefed by her for all critical steps for her patients. Now, with her blessings and support, My wife is pregnant of 3 months. \nWe would like to thank again to Dr Manju Nair for making the miracle happen. Our sincier thanks to Kavita sister and the team for helping us in each step of our journey. We pray to god for the good health and prosperity for Manju Madam and the entire Team.",

We are obviously very happy. But my feedback here is factual so that it's helpful for people like us. We didn't get the information without the unpleasant experience\nShe is very professional and thorough doctor. In the first meeting itself we told her that time is crucial for us as we had already wasted a lot of time. She explained us that the process with her will have to be step wise, but promised us that we will conceive within this year (it was June'2020) and it happened :)\nWe had seen 3 other hospitals and doctors. They were either experimenting with us or were new in the field. We wasted money, efforts and most importantly time.\nOur experience with Dr Manju Nair was fabulous. Firstly she wouldn't proceed further if she has doubts about the body preparation, (which lacked at other places, as they gave extra medicines to compensate for it) Secondly, for fertility the embryologist team plays a very important role. Dr Nair does only blastocyst transfer that was another factor which gave us confidence. She has an excellent team of embryologists and they gave us regular progress updates without follow up. Her team of nurses and assistants are always well briefed by her for all critical steps for her patients. I would get calls to initiate the injection and scans if those were the deciding factors for the next step\nOur FET procedure was smooth. The briefing for medicines and other instructions was done well right after. Infact, my injections and medicines were also optimal. (Unlike in my experience in other hospitals)\nWe are now pregnant with twins and in our first trimester :)\nOur heartfelt thanks to Dr.Manju!",

In my personal experience which I wanted to share, I was actually undergoing treatments in various hospitals and with different doctors. Nothing worked out, after sometime I even tried Homeo and Siddha for a change but everything went in vain for almost 09 years of all treatment. Later I was referred to Dr.Manju Nair through someone.  Dr.Manju Nair a person with  very Pure Soul , Very kind heart , helping , caring , Friendly, very Supportive , Positive vibes, right Guidance in all the ways like diet , reducing weight , Counseling and bring our mind to the positive side. I can say more than us she belived in her service and treatment to give success and make us parents to see us happy with kids. And that happened, Yes we were a proud Parents for a cute twins after 09 years of Marriage from now.  I really didn\u2019t know a Doctor can bring so much good thing and add happiness in someone\u2019s life especially mine. I really fascinate a doctor\u2019s profession looking at her service and dedication to work she shows. I can also say my wish is to make my Kids also to become like Dr.Manju Nair and serve for the society and for the people who were going through tough and difficulty times in their personal life. A life is not meant only for family, money, entertainment, luxury life, personal goals etc\u2026 A life is meant for doing good things to people and for the coming younger Generations. I can say she is an example for it.  A big thank you to Dr.Manju Nair from the bottom of my heart. I would have gone worse if I wouldn\u2019t have met her. Luckily by God\u2019s blessings I Met Dr.Manju Nair.",

She not only makes you feel comfortable with her friendly approach but gives you a clear direction on the way forward. It is never a monologue with her and she always involves your views and opinion at every step. \n\nShe has seen it all but still makes you feel genuinely special and your concerns important. She is direct and transparent in her treatment methods, feedback, and outcome with no false promises or sugar-coating. Despite a hectic continuous barrage of patients and procedures, Dr. Manju never fails to greet you with a genuine smile.\n\nWhat is most important during this treatment phase is patience and persistence which she always advises. It is amazing how she remembers the case & status of every single patient even after several months. When we visited her, we had no issues with fertility but possible age factors prevented pregnancies from going through. She was hand-holding us throughout the phase and the never-give-up attitude from both the doctor and our side is the reason why my pregnancy went through dispute phases where hope was almost lost.\n\nAnother major + point is that for every small query/concern we need not rush to the hospital because Dr. Manju or the nursing staff would quickly clarify this via WhatsApp or phone call. This is such a boon because other hospitals would ask you to email the query or visit them and pay consulting fee just to ask the doctor about some reaction to a particular medicine!\n\nDue to high demand and morning IUI procedures, it is often that you have 15-45mins of waiting time beyond your schedule. So please plan the visit duration accordingly. If one can not have the patience to wait for a consultation, it makes the entire journey even more stressful.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Manju Nair and the extremely friendly nursing & front-desk staff who were all supportive during the whole journey.  We are grateful to have found such a wonderful person and support staff at Cloud 9 OAR center Bangalore",

Dr. Manju is rare combination of assertiveness, *** ***** ********** skills, positivity , patience , confidence and Magic in her hands! \nThis place has made our dream come true . \nWith the history of 3 problematic pregnancies( 1 chemical , 2 ectopics - one ended up in emergency surgery ) , I was dreadful at the thought of pregnancy itself. But maternal instincts in a women are stronger than her fear for her life .  After a period of recuperation,  I gathered my strength and decided to visit cloud nine fertility. It\u2019s  only after I entered  the clinic , I realised I am not alone. I the met  doctor and she was so positive and confident  that she assured me that everything will be fine.\nAnd then my IVF journey started ! What an amazing journey it was!  Dr. Manju first put me on diet which I followed and lost 3 kgs in months ( I have been struggling with weight issues and never lost a single inch  inspite of trying hard previously )\nThen the process of IVF itself was very meticulous one. Very close and regular evaluation of the growth of follicles was performed by doctor Manju. The entire process of extraction and FET was smooth and flawless. Also the Anesthesiologist,  *************  ** ***** **** *** *** **** ******* *** *** best at their work . Dr. Manju\u2019s  team of sisters ( Kavitha , Soumya, Nethra , Jaya and Rosy) are very patient ,empathetic and professional . They know in and out of the process  and will make sure every treatment happens on the stipulated time .The lady help  inside of OT ( I am not aware of her name ) Is a very kind women  too. With the team\u2019s dedicated efforts,  I am now in the  second month pregnancy. Dr took extra care to ensure that all was well this time. No words can express our gratitude towards her. \nIn all, Dr Manju is the best doctor. She is an angel to all aspiring parents. Just trust her blindly , you won\u2019t be disappointed. . \nIf you are  still anxious, my only advice is : \nKeep Calm! It\u2019s  Dr. Manju Nair ! \n",

I've had 2 miscarriages, 1st one was conceived naturally & 2nd one was through an IVF with some other clinic, I've tried 3 IUI's with different hospitals & failed, this was such a depressing time, phew, don't want to go there. Then my friend, who was also trying for baby, conceived and told me to JUST visit Manju ma'am once and then decide on yourself how good she is... I did :) god bless my friend & her family \ud83d\udc6a for this recommendation.. I found confidence, hope, love, care, friend in Dr & her guidance.. I didn't start immediately coz I was travelling but I recommended two of my friends and guess what? Both are parents today :) I'll recommend Manju ma'am to everyone who is waiting for a Miracle, oh Manju ma'am thanks \u2764 we love you a lot..  So we started with the IVF process in November 2020, trust me, the sisters here are sone pe suhaga, awesome patience & support. Their OT team, I remember Uma from there, she's also very good.. Anesthesia Dr is also too good, I was crazily scared \ud83d\ude31 of anesthesia but that Dr, sorry ma'am I forgot your name, she had so much patience with me to convince me that the anesthesia on spine will not pain, I assure you, omg, the whole team, Manju ma'am, anesthesia dr, sisters and other staff waited patiently till I agreed, ha ha that was super, and the egg retrieval happened. I have anxiety, I've asked too many questions to Manju ma'am, throughout the process, & her staff & got all my answers. Manju ma'am being so busy dr, till now, answers all my questions & guides me patiently. I love you \u2764 ma'am. Having a baby is the only & only dream we have. We, my husband & I, thank to God, my friend who recommended, Manju ma'am, veera sister, sowmya sister, rosy sister & all the staff.\n\nThank you is not enough Ma'am. I love you\u2764",

So so glad we did however, since now we consider her a friend, not just a doctor while having the highest regard for her professional skills!\n\nWe decided to have kids very late in life (I'm 38 and my husband 40) and decided on interventions since our few months of seriously trying ourselves didn't yeild results, our initial test reports weren't great and we didn't want to wait longer. Dr Manju expertly guided us through various procedures in a manner which was stress free while still getting us the ultimate result of this gorgeious lil kid in our lives now!\n\nWe read randomly and research a lot and would go to her with our half baked information, which she always patiently listened to, was aware of the various new trends and would explain the details, probabilities, as well as possible options for us. She would also respond on what's app and always remembered our case and preferences. I love how she tailored her approach from initially telling us the best course of action to also giving us options late with her recommendations realizing that we were the kind of people who wanted to feel in control.\n\nShe's got a great staff too - Priya at HRBR reception and Nurse Mira and Kalpana at Airport road branch really stood out, though they were all great!\n\nI did have one hiccup where one injection made a muscle numb for a while, which is rare as I understand, though Dr Manju anticipated and guided it's recovery also! It's just been fabulous to have been in her care!",

                "review_text": "Before meeting Dr. Manju our struggle to have a baby went on for 6 years where we consulted many doctors. These years comprised of multiple expensive tests with no specific fertility diagnosis. We underwent 6 rounds of clomid cycles , 5 IUI rounds at 3 different clinics and one egg retrieval and one frozen IVF cycle. With no success, we came to Bengaluru to shortlist an IVF clinic where we would want to try our next IVF cycle. We met multiple doctors who gave us very complicated options to IVF like fibroid surgery before IVF, 3 months of heavy medication before IVF, repeating all the previously conducted tests, hysteroscopy etc. I was also advised to leave my job by one of the doctors.\n\nHowever, with Dr. Manju it was very different. She was very patient and studied our medical reports in detail and told us that since we had already done extensive tests in the last one-year, repeating most of them was not required. She also suggested against any fibroid removal surgery. She detailed out the steps required to do the IVF (egg retrieval and frozen embryo transfer cycle in our case) and how we could plan our India trips without me having to leave my job.\n\nDr Manju and her nurses were very kind and empathetic during the entire IVF process. From registration, meeting the doctor, collecting medicines at the pharmacy and injection administration \u2013 everything is well planned and smooth. All members of the team talk to you very patiently and answer any questions you have. Just talking to them gives you a lot of positivity and hope. DR. Manju\u2019s confidence calmed my nerves on the crucial day of egg retrieval and embryo transfer. \n\nOur IVF cycle was successful and we now have a 5-month-old boy. This seemed like a far-fetched dream before we met her. We were in touch with Dr. Manju during the entire pregnancy and she was kind enough to answer our doubts and eliminate our fears. \n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Manju and Cloud 9 at Old Airport Road. The entire team is very professional and we never felt being forced to go for unnecessary medication or procedures. ",

She immediately connected with my position and asked me to take a break for couple of months and come back in January. I followed as she suggested and consulted her back in January this year. She immediately recognized me and remembered my condition even before looking at the file. My husband and I were super impressed. \n\nThen started the IVF journey. Having had similar treatments in other places, I immediately noticed how her regimen is different. She uses a lot less medication and her approach is very positive. She was with me every step of the way and answered all the concerns of my over protective family members. We were able to retrieve healthy number of eggs and decided we would do frozen egg transfer. \n\nAfter strictly following the protocol, we transferred 2 eggs. My husband and I decided to go for two eggs because of previous failures. She supported our decision. Once the eggs were transferred, the dreaded two week wait started. But Dr Manju Nair was 100% sure that we would get a positive result. I was so scared of a negative result that I did not test at home. We went to Cloudnine on the assigned day for the blood test. We wanted to hear whatever news from the doctor herself. And when she opened the result it was more than good. The numbers looked excellent. My husband cried inconsolably in the doctors room and she couldn\u2019t stop smiling.  Few weeks later at my ultrasound we discovered that we are having twins!!! Both the eggs struck!! \n\nEarlier, when people used to say that doctors are gods I never used to relate. But that day I realized that it is indeed true. They can grant us boons which is beyond any human\u2019s capabilities. Dr Manju Nair is one such person in my life whom I can never forget. Not just because she gave us the best gift of our lives but also because she is kind, caring, patient, ************* *** loving. She is more than a doctor. She is a companion in this process. Thank You!!!!",

I tried for follicular study for a year ,took break,  again I went for a follicular study for a year, took break, later I went with IUI cycle, but no luck,  we again took a break and tried naturally.\n- We did not have any health problem and all reports turned out to be normal, thyroid levels, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy , AMH levels everything was perfect and normal. Since I had a firm belief on natural way of conceiving, I stopped all medicines and started doing a strict diet and tried the natural medicines. \n- But luck was not on our side and we had lost all hopes. Now we were left with IVF as the only option. I feared for failures and hence kept on postponing it. As we were running out of time and age was catching up, we decided to go for IVF. We got reference of Dr.Manju nair by cloud 9 hospital. We went to her based on the reviews and started consulting her, we had to travel more than a hour to reach the hospital. But it was all worth it. But we never know that god would send us a beautiful angel in the form of Dr Manju Nair, who has a miracle in her hand.\n- If you want miracles to happen  and have a happy life, you have to start consulting Dr Manju Nair. Completely we believed in her treatment, she never suggests unneccessary tests.She gave us a patient listening.\n- Her time management is just fantastic, hardly you wait for longer times, I used to very easily have the treatment early in the morning and go back to my work.\n- The hospital does not have any feel like that of a hospital, it feels like you are at home, which is very important during this tough time. All staffs, nurses everyone are very caring and considerate towards you.\n- They have excellent atmosphere where you sure to get positive vibes. Not expecting too much, I was normal and not thinking much of the IVF cycle, just believed the doctor and god sent angel.\n- Now what to say my IVF cycle was success and I am conceived. This is a very big achievement in my life since this was my very first pregnancy after long wait...Through out my IVF cycle I did not feel any pain, it's all because of Dr manju nair, never thought IVF was just so easy one to go ahead, which I feared all these years. My eggs were frozen and it is just injected at right time, everything was painless procedures. \n- Timing , medication and  decision making are so important in IVF cycles,  Dr manju nair is a perfect person to trust and has very high success rate. I highly recommend anyone to have treatment under Dr Manju nair and wish you all your dreams come true.\n- Thanks again Dr maju nair from bottom of my heart. She has played a very important role in getting me out of despair. 3 cheers to Manju Nair.",

Ours was no different. When we met Dr. Manju Nair, we carried with us the baggage of a failed IVF cycle, broken trust with the previous doctor, and a barrage of unanswered questions. Having all the money in the world is insufficient when the inability to understand the root cause of constant failure is beyond comprehension.\n\nOur journey with Dr. Manju started with renewed hope, and to cut the long story short, we were in the process of discovering new challenges that we had to face with a brave face \u2013 low AMH, DOR, MFI, to name a few. We were persistent and visited month after month, hoping one cycle would be the golden one. A major thing in our case was we learnt advocating for ourselves over time. Dr. Manju suggested lifestyle changes, exercise, and patience as the key. For us, it was her reassurance and confidence that mattered. And then, there we had it \u2013 just one embryo waiting to get transferred. We took a break for a few months before the transfer and met Dr. again. All the suggested lifestyle changes helped me have good endometrial lining, but was it enough? In my husband\u2019s words, a thousand things must come together for a cycle to work. To be honest, we went ahead with limited expectations and all our trust on Dr. Manju\u2019s shoulders. You see, when you have just one embryo in the basket, that\u2019s all you can do! The dreadful 2-week wait began, and we followed the doctor\u2019s words like a bible, took medicines on time, and prayed endlessly for the dreadful two years to end with a miracle. On the 13th day, I had the moment we were waiting for years - got a positive UPT, followed by a consistent rise in HCG. Today, it\u2019s surreal that I am sitting five months pregnant.\n\nIf you are someone who is going through infertility, with a myriad of complications, I see you. In fact, I am you. Please trust Dr. Manju. There will be times when you may question everything, but when you feel like giving up, look up to her. We are 'pregnant' with our precious baby solely because of her treatment. Remember, she is my second doctor, and I regret not meeting her earlier. After struggling for 2-2.5 years, we are where we are today because of her. Thank you, Doc; we owe it all to you. \n",

My husband and I visited Manju ma'am after not being able to conceive for almost an year. We had no concrete answers on as to why we were unable to conceive from the previous doctors whom we consulted. Visiting Manju Ma'am gave us a lot of confidence. She truly knows her job and explained her methods in the first meeting . It took us another year for us to be finally pregnant, but throughout this journey I felt that we could not have been in better hands. She is truly the best out there - not just in terms of competence but also her friendly and straightforward nature. She will not build false hopes, but she will empathize with you and counsel you. Also - she does not force any decisions on her patients and after presenting all the options - she asks us to make an informed decision which I truly appreciate.\nShe has given us the biggest blessing of our life. We have been blessed with a baby girl last month and words are not enough to express our gratitude for her. I truly believe that God works through her hands.\nThank you Manju Ma'am for everything !\n\nTo anyone reading this - hang in there and trust Manju ma'am. You bundle of joy will arrive in your life soon and at that instant everything that you are fighting through will be worth it.\n",

Trust me, in-spite of we referred to someone for regular checkups, she still pings us and check our wellbeing. Imagine someone responding to you at 9PM as well as 3AM. She owns the responsibility of making life beautiful. Doc's skill & efforts and my wife's struggle, don't know how I repay them. One suggestion I can give it to everyone, treasure every second you spend with Doc (Because there are people waiting like us) and just follow her instructions. Classroom studies & tons of experience are no match with your Google knowledge. Nurses & Staff, you guys are amazing too, people might think its your job but I call it pure skill.\n\nDoc, thank you once again and god bless you with good health and energy to contribute more to our community.\n\nCheers,\nKD",

This is way beyond from my POV and I can never forget that day in my life. Saying a mere thanks would never be appropriate for what doc has given in our lives!! However a million thanks to you doctor and your team!! To look back now, It has been an amazing and lovely experience. She was very vivid on the kind of treatment and her approach towards patients. She patiently listened to our history, concerns and clearly explained the possible line of treatments and issues. Despite her very hectic schedule which might probably starts early from 3 AM, she always ensure to respond to our queries on mobile or over calls. The nurses and supporting staff are very helpful, kind and understanding. we are glad to have found her and eternally grateful to Dr Manju Nair and team.",

She's very clear at her approach her ways of treating patients , medication protocols. She is such a busy doctor handling so many patients still she shared her number with and took time to respond to our queries over wats app. She will never suggest for any unnecessary tests unless it's very much required. She knows what are the doubts most patients deal with and she will clear them all before even you ask her. We have been waiting for this Miracle for so many years. ** ***** **** ** ****** *** *** ** *** *** ******* ** *** ******* ***** ** *** ***** I should also mention the nursing staff Kavitha and Veera for helping me through this and been such a support. 1 best thing about Dr Manju Nair is that she is very much on time always, I never had any long waits for any of my appointment it was always on time.  I would like to appreciate the entire Cloudnine team for keeping everything so organized and professional, every appointment I had a follow up call for reminder. I was surprised I had got reminder calls for my tests too. Every patient is treated with importance and at most attention. ",

It was through lot of research and reviews that we zeroed in . Speculations were there during initial connect but the more we interacted the more we were comfortable. The first couple of connects was more on the past medical records and what we have gone through before narrowing the future treatment. The way Dr. Manju explained every thing in details and was there in every step is not often we see these days. She was always reachable and recommended the next steps which should be better going forward. Through her support and guidance my wife finally conceived. She closely monitored each step and gave us the exact informations which really helped us. Apart from Dr.Manju ,The help staff and nurses were there to ensure things are on the right track. Really fortunate to have Dr. Manju as our doctor in this journey. We definitely recommend this doctor.\nThankyou Dr.Manju !!!",

Her confidence in her approach helped reassure us.  Thanks to her expertise, I was able to conceive after years of trying. I was referred to her by a friend, after an IVF cycle with another doctor/clinic had failed. Dr Manju was able to help me understand why that cycle failed and to recommend the appropriate treatment protocol for me. I could not have asked for a better doctor. Her team at Cloudnine is amazing. The nurses are professional and caring. Even the anaesthesiologist for the procedures was fantastic. I was nervous about the anaesthesia procedure for the egg retrieval and she spent extra time in the Operation Theatre explaining the process to me and ensuring that it was a relaxed, calm environment for me. With Dr Manju Nair and her team, you are surrounded by the care of people who treat you like a whole person, not just a file number or a billing ID. If you are struggling with infertility issues, just close your eyes and trust what Dr Nair says. That\u2019s what my friend had suggested to me and it is so true. I wish I had consulted her sooner.

She never rushes with any of her patients and does not advise to undergo any treatment just for the benefit of the hospital. Doctor is extremely friendly and polite to talk to,you can get all your questions answered when consulting her. She has a special skill in handling her patients as she understands the fear we are going through and gives the courage to sail through. She and her staff have devoted all their time including on weekends to help patients achieve the happiness of having kids.  While we underwent our treatment under Dr.Manjus guidance, we were well supported and taken care by the doctor as well as the entire staff right from all the sisters as well other supporting staff. We are extremely greatful to the entire couldnine OAR team for being with us during this process. Special thanks to sister Kavitha and Soumya for always helping whenever needed. They have gone beyond and taken care to make us feel very comfortable. Dr.Manju truely is an angel sent by God who can create miracles through her expertise as well as love and care. ",

She has been instrumental in keeping me positive and making me believe that success is round the corner. She is very experienced and committed to getting results.\nWe would like to thank Dr Manju and her entire team - a true blessing in our lives. May god bless you with all the happiness good health and tons of success. Thank you for being the reason for bringing in happiness in our lives !!!! \nWould recommend everyone going through a difficult phase in conception to meet her once for sure ..... ",

From the very first day of my visit, there was a positive vibe which makes you feel a sense of security and an affirmation on being at the right place. She always mentioned to stay positive and it was her responsibility to help me get pregnant. I haven't met a doctor with such commitment and dedication but what stands her apart from the rest is being an epitome of humanity and feel lucky that our paths have crossed. \nI would also like to convey my thanks to the team of Sisters at this center who take very good care and keep motivating you at every step. This team and Ma'am is a rare combination to find and compliment each other very well. She considers your problem as her own and gives the best shot. I would highly recommend Dr Manju and C9 at old airport road.\nAs truely said, \"Hope is Born\" which is very much apt at the old airport road fertility clinic and all credit goes to Dr Manju. Please do take good care of yourself as there are lots who need  your support and guidance. You are a true blessing for us and will always be in our prayers.",

Not only that her persistence made us confident but made us mentally prepared for the course of treatment.\n\nYes, we went through multiple IUI cycles and ended up being pregnant with IVF ICSI. It may look like a template but ideally differ for each persona and couple but it is just the mere professionalism and the commitment of her being available to your queries at odd times makes you feel you are at the right hands and right place.\n\nIt's an awesome experience for us. Words can never describe for anyone who struggles to get what is once consider very obvious and natural, becoming a mother, a parent. \n\nWe are so happy that this experience came in through a qualified professional with a personal touch to make you feel you are not one in the crowd.\n\n\n",

At every point of time we have critical issues but Manju nair executed each and every step of the process with sheer perfection and brilliance. Her timing and execution is the best thing that will make Manju Nair as a unique doctor out of all the existing ones. She carefully listens to the problems and finds the exact reasons of the cause and solves with in no time. We were able to contact her at any time in the day and almost replies with in no time. Though we were facing the problems at time we first met Manju Nair, we found an angel in the name her which solved all our problems. Finally great doctor with good knowledge of the process and a good human being with kind heart. Now we are going to have a baby because of her treatment which we taught impossible before meeting Manju Nair. Will pray to God for her Well being and happiness and she will forever stay in the happiness of my family.",

Even for one day I never felt disappointed after started consulting with her. She is really a God sent angel who will bring luck to those who suffer with infertility problem. May be the treatment what you get here might be similar, but her expertise is what makes all the difference. Doctor will do scan herself, I think that kind of helps the treatment to be more effective. She is available over phone all the time to help (as early as 4'O clock in the morning also!!), even after you are referred and started prenatal consultation with some other doctor. The only problem here is you become so spoiled by the care she gives, and you look for the same support from all doctors you meet. Unfortunately you won't find the same affection and care from anybody else like her.... I remember once she was too sick for a week or so and not taking any break and continuing consultation and procedures..she seemed more bothered about my treatment than her health when I asked about her health, she is very punctual too, some days you reach hospital very early in the morning like 6.30 and think you are the first one to reach then you see her slowly walking out of her cabin...it is rare to see such blessed souls. May god bless her with all happiness and good health. ",

Thank you for coming in as early as 5.30 a.m. for our procedure. It surely speaks volumes about your dedication towards your patients. Thank you for spending your personal time amidst your super busy schedule. A doctor messaging a patient proactively to ask about thier well-being and the steps to follow is surely one of a kind. We are in awe with your dedication and can't admire you enough! Thank you for making the difficult journey and uncertainty along the way a breeze with your support and comfort. Thank you for carefully analyzing every step you took empathetically.\n\nThank you, Priya. Thank you so much for giving painless injections and the spectacular understanding you had. Thank you for staying back late in the night just for our shot. Thank you for your small talks in order to distract me from the fear! Your affectionate personality, loving  and timely support is a blessing. \n\nThank you, Sumitra. Thank you for being extremely careful in giving me the daily injections. The effort you put in so that I don't feel pain is truly appreciated. We are grateful for the care in which you took samples for blood work and offered me comfort during the same. You are pleasant and focused attitude is truly acknowledged.\n\nThank you, Rahman for greeting us pleasantly always and thoughfully remembering my name! He is extremely organized and does his job with dedication.\n\nThank you to the pharmacists especially Mr. Harish for guiding me with the nessecary steps for the medications.\n\nA big thank you to Dr. Ramya and the other doctors at the lab in the Kammanhalli and Old Airport Branches.

We came to Dr.Manju Nair Ma'am with a broken spirit. She took our concerns seriously and addressed all our questions. In first visit itself she has encourage us a lot and filled our mind with positive wibes which is very much necessary, since we are already aware that only option left with us is IVF. She took the time to explain the process to us and to set a plan that we all are comfortable with. In just a few short months you didn't just give us hope, you gave us the results! I appreciate all that you have done, now my wife is 8-weeks pregnant. It is time for my wife to transfer to another doctor for further pregnancy treatment. \n\nSupport from the sisters and other staff is appreciable. They are very well experienced and good at their work.  Additional thanks to Sister and Nurses who handled my injection phobic wife very patiently.\n\nThe charges mention during our first visit and what we have paid during our entire process does not differ much which is very good thing.\n\nIn closing, We will miss you and your staff. Your help to so many women throughout the year is inspiring. We only wish, if we have came to you earlier. You became more than a doctor, you are a friend and guardian. My wife and I are so thankful for your guidance, wisdom and friendship!\n\nThank you so much to DR Manju Nair Ma'am and Team for making our dream come true.\n\nBest Regards,\nRajesh & Varsha Sharma\n\n",

We had been chasing our dream of having a baby since many years. After a roller-coaster of doctors\u2019 visits across Bangalore, we were finally fortunate to land at Dr. Manju Nair's place. Our first meeting itself was very promising and the subsequent ones boosted our positivity to gain confidence within ourselves.Now I am extremely happy to enjoy this new promotion in my life as \u201cMother\u201d and Dr.Manju Nair has been one  of the strongest supports helping me reach this stage. Unlike other doctors, she has her own style to analyse the problems and is very confident with her approach and treatment methods.She  never demands any unnecessary tests and has her unique nursing staff team with rich knowledge. The best part of Manju Nair is her availability around the clock. I hardly see such doctor's availability over WhatsApp and in-time response to keep patients connected.Not sure if she really finds time to even sleep as she is always reachable and we used to receive responses  early morning at 4.00AM too.Her dedication & commitment is commendable ! Another best part which is really overwhelming is her personal follow-ups with maternity doctor( Manjula Deepak) after the handover for pregnancy.She gives importance to each and every patient with the same attention. Her success is evident from her appreciations wall with loads of good wishes. With the blessings of God and Manjula Nair we are blessed with baby girl.  Throughout the journey of 9 months she cares for her patients and ensures best in class guidance . We as a family pray god to bless her with 100 more years of healthy life to bring the same joyous moment for many aspiring parents. We love you to the moon & back to infinity forever and ever Manju mam.",

After actively trying for an year, we visited Dr Manju Nair @old airport road after seeing all the reviews. Well all I can say, in our first visit itself we were pretty confident that we are in good hands.Ma'am tried to evaluate us with all tests, but it was really frustrating for us when without a known reason we were not able to conceive. With Maam's constant advise, I was even able to get my weight down from 81 kgs to 52 kgs.After 2 failed natural cycles, 3 Failed IUI cycles, Ma'am advised for more advanced treatment. I had complete faith in her, and said yes for IVF.To our surprise, during ovulation induction, it was found I was a poor responder for the IVf injections. But I still remember Ma'am saying 'leave it on me, you just relax'. That gave another hope and we just went on.Though our numbers were very less, but Maam's confidence for getting a positive pregnancy helped us move forward.Then it was d day for our first pregnancy test, and we couldn't control our tears when we saw positive result. We almost waited for 2.5 years to see this result and due to Manju Ma'am we were able to see this. She is not just an amazing doctor, but a very positive soul. She induces that positiveness in you from the very starting.She made me realise the goodness of a healthy lifestyle.Along with her, the entire staff of nurses - sister Jaya, Soumya, Veera , Kavitha - all were equally amazing and supporting. They all made us feel like a family.I don't have enough words to thank Dr Manju and her team.Without a second thought, I highly recommend her for all couple having trouble conceive. Have faith in her, she is an angel \u2764\ufe0f",

We were just impressed the way mam listen's to the whole story & patient's concern. Mam has awesome listening, speaking & behavioral skills along with indeed her fertility experience  & treatment which is suggested. *** *** ***** ********* *********** ***** * *********** We were suggested the right treatment considering our history of past treatments & medications taken. The treatment started at the right time & ended per our visits as & when suggested by Mam. We were given the right amount of care during the critical phases of the treatment. Scans & medications were suggested & tweaked per the physical conditions, which i believe is utmost important for the health of the patient. We were just overwhelmed how Manju Mam lightens the whole room with her shear conversation because these treatments are not only expensive but also take a huge toll on patients & there families mental health. We always felt relaxed the way mam used to address each & every concern even if we asked the same question mulitple times, although that sitation hardly arises as Manju mam is so good in the way she explains the treatment process. Not only Manju mam but her staff at Cloudnine fertility is just so awesome & supportive, inspite of huge crowd on weekends the patients are called in the queue & addressed per there concerns. Although the waiting time can be more at times but these treatments do take time & we understand the same. The staff is cherry on the cake indeed. I give a high-five to both Dr. Manju Nair & hospital Staff. Please continue doing the great work of blessing babies to couples. Our wishes are always with you. Dr. Manju Mam, thanks is just the word i know, but we feel much more than that indeed for the blessing you have given to us. THANKS A TON & ALL THE BEST.",

We were then referred to Dr Manjula Deepak for our pregnancy journey and she is such a jolly and caring personality who always keep track of your baby health and developments. She was always supportive and available for her patients all the time whenever needed. It was a great experience with Cloudnine hospitals, even in the crisis time when world is struggling with Virus infections.\n\nThank You once again to Dr Manju Nair and Dr Manjula Deepak and all Cloudnine Hospitals, HRBR nurses and staff for such a great and supportive time.\n\nIf anyone is looking for any help in taking decision related to IVF and the journey experience, you can reach out to us to know experiences of our journey.",

We had already consulted at least 3-4 renowned doctors  in Bangalore without any success during this timeframe. After two failed IUIs our last doctor suggested a surgical scan to my wife which involved some surgical procedure to check for the cause. We were worried to get under the knife just for a diagnosis & decided not to go for it. Then we met Dr Manju & we were very pleased in the very first interaction with her. She tried to understand our history, tests done so far, all past consultations etc. She asked for some additional tests & was able to point the problem in first few weeks only. She referred me to an andrologist & after few visits to him we were complete with all diagnostics. It was time for decision & she very clearly articulated the solutions with the result timeframe & then asked us to take the decision. Given the situation with my sperm shape &  mortality, the options for us were either a surgery for me or IVF.(That surgical scan suggested by previous doctor wasn\u2019t required at all).  We went for IVF as per her suggestion & it was a success. It sounded unbelievable to us when pregnancy test showed positive.  Our baby is almost four months old now. When I look back, it was a struggle for almost 3 years visiting different doctors, waiting long hours and undergoing scans. It is indeed very painful visiting doctors undergoing different scans, procedures( we had two unsuccessful IUIs before, one  test for fallopian tube blockage) & still neither success nor a proper diagnosis for the problem could be found. I wish we had met Dr Manju in the first place itself.\nBest part about Dr Manju is her friendliness, approachability, positivity & tell it like it is attitude. She will boost you, give hope & not give any false promises. We always used to feel good after every consultation with her. In case anyone is facing problems with conceiving, I would definitely recommend  to consult Dr Manju. *** ** ********** *** ****** ****** ** *** *** * wish her even more success with all her patients.\n ",

We were so frustrated, worried, lifeless. Moving each day was very difficult. Almost one and half years passed. We consulted other Doctor's but with no positive results. Planning for our next child was not so easy with that mindset. This is when we decided to step into cloudnine and have an appointment with Dr. Manju Nair. \n\nIn our first visit itself She understood our mindset and our problems so well. She didn't immediately put us in any treatment. Instead, She instructed us about our diet, change in our mindset, correcting our lifestyle. With that she gave us two months time to plan our child. She sensed our feelings so deeply and understand our mindset. She is straight forward and to the point. She moves with lot of positivity in bringing the result. She told us if it doesn't happen then don't worry, come back and I will take care. Her confidence, dedication towards her profession is just beautiful. Her approach have us confidence and made us configure. At the end of the second month,  during our second appointment with her we came out with positive pregnancy results. *** ** * **** ******* ** ***\n\nNow we are blessed with a baby boy.\n\nThank you Doctor.\n- Our little prince and his happy parents - Chandana & Shivaraman and our entire family",

Dr. Manju Ma'am was so supportive and being a native speaker it helped us face the treatments and guidelines very calm. She advised us in  natural ways of conception and helped us overcome the stress. Right now, playing with out 6 month old toddler, we feel so relaxed thinking about the time we have gone through an year ago. She had been very supportive overcome any fear we had during the course. We had recommended her to few of our acquaintances and we have received similar feedback from them as well. ",

I can definitely say that you are in very safe and trusted hands if you are being treated by Dr Manju Nair. Just do what she asks and the chips will fall in place, literally trust her blindly. She is very kind and attentive towards every patient. Looks and replies for every query we have. There had been times i panicked and asked her what to do and she was there with me at every step. Truly grateful to her. Special thanks to all her staff who work relentlessly, sincerely and proactively. They are very friendly and helpful. A unit can't function so well just because of the doctor.

She is very friendly, kind and helpful; extremely busy yet always cares to personally reply to all WhatsApp messages whenever in confusion or need any suggestions.\nAll staff including Kavitha, Sowmya, Vira, Archana, Gayathri and others are very nice and helpful too.\nDue to heavy rush, patients are advised to set aside some time while visiting the clinic; however, that is just an indication of the excellent treatment and service one can expect. \ud83d\ude0a The only suggestion for management is to fast-track the queue and shorten waiting period for the patients who have already conceived, as otherwise the long wait may be quite painful for them.\nWonderful experience overall.

But we weren't satisfied with them.\nOnce we entered your circumstances we were getting positive energy, positive vibes by seeing the photos in the entrance.\nThat time itself we realized that we are going to get positive results here. \nWithin the 3 months I gets pregnant by your treatment. \nBiggest thanks for you. \nOur daughter/son is first of all your child, we are after you only.\nThanks for making our life happier.\nI know that thanks is very little word. *** *** *** *** *** *** ***",

She is optimistically positive and always have told us about the same. Sometimes she will be strict and that is because she cares for you and wants a positive outcome for you.

However, after meeting Dr Manju Nair, we knew it would be with Dr Manju Nair with whom we will be consulting and doing the procedure. First meeting itself she gave such a positive and caring vibe that we decided to consult with her only which we felt was very important for us. Not only one of the best doctors and approachable, but she also knows what best for us. We have a positive result in our first attempt. Even the support stuff of hers are very caring and dedicated. They will constantly get in touch with us making sure we follow all pre and post procedure steps and medicines. Kavitha and Sowmya were very helpful during out visit to clinic (Old Airport Road) and queries through WhatsApp messages. A big thank you to Dr Manju Nair.",

Words cannot express how thankful we are for the care and compassion we received from the very beginning. We were always treated with every little detail possible. We were always getting positivity and encouragement to keep trying. We would never want anyone to go through this journey, but if you are facing any fertility issues then Dr. Manju Nair is the one for you. We consider Dr. Manju Nair and her stuff a very important part of our lives that we will never forget.\nThank you from the bottom of our hearts.",

The care taken by her made us feel like a one other family person. It was great privilege and an unforgettable experience to have met you and you have certainly changed our lives for good. Dr. Manju Nair is one such person, who doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines or tests. Got positive results in the first cycle.\n\nYou and your team (Sowmya, Veena, Jaya, Kavita) and all other staff created a welcome and safe environment where people can trust. ",

Even though it did not work out, what l really liked about her approach was that every cycle was different. She is always calm, confident and determined. We finally did an IVF and are pregnant. I can't thank her enough for making this pregnancy possible. The entire treatment and procedure was smooth and painfree.Thank you so much for your undivided attention, support and love.We would also like to thank the entire cloudnine staff at kamnahalli for all their kind words and support.Words cannot express how thankful we are to Dr Manju Nair.

After trying for over 3years for a baby and seeing only negative results , we were in our lowest of spirits. But the whole team gave us so much of positive hopes, and we conceived in the 1st try. We are extremely grateful to you ma'am. Because of you we are expanding our family and are extremely excited!! I would recommend Cloudnine Fertility to any couple any day.  Thank you all for making our experience with you so positive! Thanks to the entire team of nurses as who are so humble, kind and accomodating. Thank you ma'am for everything you have done for us!!

From registration, meeting the Dr., collecting medicines at the pharmacy and injection administration - everything is well planned and smooth. \n\nOur IVF cycle is successful in initial pregnancy test after 8 weeks. This seemed like a far-fetched dream before we met her.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr Manju ma'am and Cloud 9 at Old Airport Road, the entire team is very professional and we never felt being forced to go for unnecessary medication and procedures.",

We had been to different fertility clinics, all supposedly number 1 in Bangalore, but none of them worked for us. We wasted 3 years and lakhs of rupees. The whole process was so smooth with each appointment having minimal wait time and being most productive. Her staff of nurses are also very efficient. They all know the process going on for each patient. I had transferred my embryos from Milann to Cloudnine. She converted them to blastocysts first. Her embryologist proactively called and updated us about the status and next steps. We never experienced such efficiency anywhere else. I am grateful to Dr. Manju Nair for solving for my fertility issues and the psychological trauma it had caused. We will forever be grateful we found her.",

The way staff treated was just awesome.\nI always called Dr.Manju as my big sister, the way she guided me through out the procedure is just like my mother. I even use to call/ping her when ever i have doubts.\n\nThanks,\nManju and Team for making us from two to threee\nFrom, A&A",

For someone who has had tried so many doctors before finally coming across Dr. Manju, we can guarantee this will be the final step in everyone's fertility treatment journey. In all the years of trying to conceive, never have we ever come across a doctor who is so skilled, so patient and the one who remembers every detail about her patient. It is extremely rare to find such a doctor. Moreover, she does all the scans by herself. You can imagine the level of diligence and personal attention she gives to her patients. On top of it, she offers her whatsapp number too in case you have any doubt. I have personally chatted with her many times regarding my concerns and got replies within no time. Truly respect her and are owed to her forever as we head in our pregnancy journey day with D day coming closer and closer. Her team also deserves a shout out as all the nurses relentlessly help you out and make you comfortable in every visit. Thank you Dr. Manju Nair and the entire Cloudnine Team",

We have been visiting different clinics and trying to conceive since 5 years, and failed IVF cycle had taken a toll on us emotionally and physically. We understand that even IVF is not 100 % guarantee for positive results and many factors are involved. We wanted to try again after all it was our dream. IVF drains your energy in all levels, but when we finally consulted Dr Manju, we were satisfied that we reached the right place. Hospital was near to our home, flexible appointment's was available, caring sisters who made the journey of injections and medications better. Of course we need patience, we were treated for the original cause of infertility. Many centers just focus on female disorders, but both male and female issues if any has to be checked. With out treating primary cause if we try IVF, we may not get a positive results which happened with us in a different clinics. Dr Manju goes through the history well and never rushes us to any treatment. She just suggested right guidance at right time and finally we got a big fat positive results that we had been waiting since years. Thank you Doctor for all your efforts in fulfilling our dreams.",

She instils so much positivity in her patients that when you are waiting for her appointment you will be all worried but when you come out of her room after meeting her, I have not seen a single patient who did not come out smiling.She is always available for support through phone. \nI still remember, I took a pregnancy test at 4am in the morning and sent her the result and she replied within 5 minutes, that is how much she cares for her patients. Once we got the positive result and went to meet her, she told we can always send her reports and keep in touch throughout the pregnancy.  \n\nShe also has a group of sisters equally caring and supporting and always smiling and ready to help with our problems. Dr Manju Nair mam's and her team makes us just feel positive. We are thankful to you all from the deepest of our heart!",

It is a very trying period and we were lucky to be under Dr Manju Nair's excellent care. She is a highly competent doctor, a thorough professional and most of all a wonderful person. We had 2 failed IUI cycles before moving on to IVF, which was successful in the first attempt. Dr Manju Nair, embryologist Dr Sapna, nurses and support staff were excellent. Forever grateful to them, for the most precious gift of a miracle baby, which make the hardships totally worth it. I missed Dr Manju Nair after being transferred to my obstetrician after 6-7 weeks of pregnancy. \n\nAreas of improvement - 1] Wish there was a dedicated nurse who is at the clinic by 7 AM for injections. This would save some commute time in Bangalore.\n2] Would be nice to have two sperm transfers per IUI cycle. Even if it increases the chance of conception by 1%, I would go for it.\n3] More comprehensive tests to check for male infertility from day one. This is a common phenomenon across fertility clinics. There is slightly more focus on female infertility initially.\n\nThings I liked about the doctor: Her compassion, commitment to patients, strong work ethics, humility, competence, confidence *** ********** *** ** ********** *** ** *** **** ********* *********** ** ********** ",

Go to her without the slightest hesitation, follow her advice to the t, and yes you will have your little one in your arms in no time!!!\n",

The good and positive part was she never rushed the treatment even when we were anxious and feeling low. Her approach towards her all single patients are commendable, simple example is she remembers minute details of each patients quite accurately. She is an epitome of professionalism and dedication.\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Manju Mam throughout the life and happy to announce that she made our dream come true as we conceived finally and expecting our first child, hoping we will have smooth pregnancy journey.\n\nThanks a lot Manju Mam and the HRBR Cloudnine team. We strongly recommend Dr. Manju Nair all who face fertility issues and do keep faith on her treatment.",

When we met doctor, i found her friendly, confident, to the point and the best thing was that she was not at all in a hurry of any conclusion in my treatment.  There was no fear while doctors visit sessions, even I started looking forward to meet doctor and in every visit we felt one step closer to our destination. She gradually started the process, didn't give us any false hope's and always explained everything in detail. Whole process was very smooth and hassle free.  \nIf you are also facing any issues related to infertility, without any doubt please visit Dr Manju Nair. \n We will always  be thankful to Dr Manju Nair and her whole team, specially I want to mention kavita for all the help, guidance you gave to us to achieve this blessing. \nRegards ",

She helped us to understand the issues and provided right guidance at the right time which resulted in success. All I can say at the moment, We are expecting :) !!   \n\nManju Nair has sheer knowledge in the field of Infertility medical science. Her diagnosis, medication & advise are to the point & result oriented. \nBe patient & follow her advise. It is natural to have questions in mind, but due course all'll get clarified\n\nWe are immensely satisfied with the overall experience which We have with her & Cloud9. At last thank you to the complete staff & team who supported & facilitated the memorable emotional journey.  ",

I have been married for 12 years and was suffering without a baby. I tried multiple rounds of ivf in many reputed clinics in India as well as abroad. All I got in return was failures and miscarriages. I had almost lost hope and was thinking adoption was the only route left for me. When someone suggested me to try with Dr Manju. I just thought it as a last try and visited her. In the first visit itself I felt a positive vibe and felt good that I may find success. And eventually every visit gave me hope and confidence. And I should say I was lucky to receive a excellent  treatment for my health condition. I got a positive pregnancy test but was very scared that whether it would continue. Dr Manju and sister kavita gave me confidence at every step and enquired regularly about baby. Now finally I have completed 14 weeks and all is well. I hope my journey will be successful. \u201c Thanks\u201d would be a very small word to Dr Manju. She is an angel in our Life who has made our impossible dream possible.",

The best part unlike other fertility centers we like the most is even if it is a first visit, there are no junior doctors taking down the history and then explaining it to maam. Maam herself listens to all previous stories pretty patiently, reads all past reports and make note in the file that way we felt there is nothing missed due to a third party in between the patient and the main doctor.People who come for fertility treatments mostly would consider themselves half doctors due to the abundant materials available in internet and would feel - yeah we know this! But, there are certain things that are known only to the best like maam and that small thing, the one which was missed this whole time could make an impact in your treatment/life. We went for scans, follow-ups and finally under went the FET transfer process and we are currently expecting our little one in 6 months. ",

The professionalism and coordination in team has been great and we've been informed every step of the way. With 1 IUI and 2 IVFs , we are finally pregnant. There were numerous times where we felt discouraged, hope less, physically and emotionally drained. During these times, Dr. Manju Nair's words of wisdom \"slow n steady wins the race\" would carry us through, helping us along with prayer, to continue fighting to become parents. This is what a patient need at such stressful time. She had supported us in every phase. No matter how unsuccessful we were with each cycle, giving up was never an option. As each cycle ended with a negative outcome, a new path opened for us. We trusted her wholeheartedly, never did we second guess her knowledge, advice and sincerity. She made us so comfortable, loved and supported as each cycle passed. She is always available on whatsapp  for any queries, irrespective of her very busy schedule she always takes out time for her patients. We are glad that we have made this decision.  Her entire team all are a part of our story and will never be forgotten. This is a lifelong bond. \n\nWe would surely recommend people to visit Dr. Manju Nair for any infertility problems without giving a second thought. ",

When you meet her, you will find a sense of positivity, happiness and hope for future. The tag line, \"Hope is born here\", is so much true.In our journey with Dr Manju, she always believed in running the tests and medicine which were only needed and always took us into confidence and explained every step in detail which gave us greater understanding of what was happening and how body is reacting to it. She also advised when to take break from medicine when it was not required and also accomodated us logistically as we used to travel almost 23kms to her clinic. And most importantly, she always gave us hope for future. When problems are Unknown, and every single report is right,  there is greater frustration and fear but she guided us patiently through our most difficult days into happiness.Thank you Dr Manju, Jaya, Kavitha, Soumya, Meera, Nethra, Uma, Rosy, Srinivas & entire team for your love & support.",

We first visited a hospital close by from our home and after 6 months were told my ovulation wasn't happening right. It was then I was also diagnosed with PCOS. The doctor gave up on me and suggested to see a specialist. I was devastated beyond words. It was in Jan 2020, while searching for a doctor we came across Dr Manju Nair. We were very skeptical of going for an IVF and weren't even sure if that was our only solution. We visited Dr Manju Nair in Jan 2020 and she went through all my previous treatment files. She did not refer for additional test which itself felt positive. I weighed 72kgs then and the first task she put me on was weight loss with strict diet. Doctor was very confident that we will conceive naturally with weight loss. I lost 10 kgs in 3 months all because of Doctor's motivation and constant support. Since we couldn't conceive even then, we went to her and she suggested we do a OI treatment. I was very scared since this was the treatment in the previous hospital as well which failed for me. However, she broke my fears and said 'Just one right ovulation cycle and it will be a success'. true to her words, in just one treatment, I conceived! We are 7 weeks pregnant now. Words can't express our gratitude for Doctor. She is the most amazing Doctor who speaks to the point and is a god sent savior! ",

This feedback was suppose to be given in ,Feb 2020.We both were 100 percent confident I would get pregnant in the first try, it's all because we believed in her. she is such a blessing to couples struggling to get pregnant. she is up to the point, follows the prototype.her smile and humour has made our treatment go smoother.I would specially thank her for supporting us on wts app with medicines during the covid situation even though her treatment part was completed.we were visiting all 3 branch of cloud nine, we were happy with all 3 branch staffs except the long wait time in HAL main branch on weekends as the main procedures happen there. I was little disappointed with a nurse handling the patients queue who was always rude.overall we got what we came for (our little bundles of joy).\ud83d\ude33",

Dr. Manju was not only friendly but result oriented. , She believes in \u201cto the point\u201d treatment, though I was willing to give time, she didn\u2019t want to lose any time. She never suggested unnecessary medicines and expensive vitamin tablets , I know as I had visited other doctors too. My treatment cost was nearly half with dr. Manju. Waiting time is also better as her team is organised and committed. She is calm and will answer all your questions at any time on WhatsApp . She will remember you and your case very well . She is with you through out the journey. One doctor who is so confident, smiling and will help you realise your dreams in the best way possible. She supported me to try myself and when it didn\u2019t work, she was quick to suggest a surrogate and we are now having our baby finally. We owe a lot of our happiness to her. I feel bad that I didn\u2019t visit her previously. Cloud nine is blessed to have a doctor like her. ",

While I was under treatment with multiple doctors for the same ** ******** ********* *** ******* *** ***** where-in I had to take high dosage of steroids, I was apprehensive about having a biological child in future. At this dark stage Dr. Manju Nair came into our life and she literally held our hands firmly and confidently to light. Right from getting a genetic testing done (to ensure that the disease doesn't carried over to next generation), listening to all doubts patiently in an around everything be it adoption, donor sperms etc and guiding us through with a smile always. Trust me that smile and confidence helped us sail through the tough times smoothly. After two unsuccessful attempts of  IUI (with success rate clearly explained), finally my wife conceived in first IVF attempt. Probably, it was the best anniversary gift that I could have asked for. Thanks a ton doctor for being there. For all those facing any kind of fertility challenge I would highly recommend them to visit Dr. Manju Nair and let her take care of your worries. Not to forget, the support staff be it HAL or Whitefield or HRBR layout, all of them having been really warm and empathetic in this journey.  Thanks a ton Cloud9 for everything!    ",

After having tried for nearly 2.5 years to have a baby and nothing turning fruitful, We met Dr. Manju for fertility issues. The very first consultation gave us the  confidence that we are definitely going to be parents soon. Despite having to go through a number of tests, procedures, injections and medications our journey towards becoming parents was made so easy only because of  Dr Manju's positive approach and the vibrant smile that she always treated us with. Her memory power I must say is just incredible. Although Dr Manju treats a lot of unique patients everyday, as a patient it makes me feel important in her eyes when the doctor remembers my entire case history on seeing me. Even the IVF procedure turned out to be a cake walk only because of the confidence that she gave us. And today by the grace of the Almighty and with the help of Dr Manju I am pregnant. Dr Manju Nair is definitely a light to people going through the darkness of infertility.",

She was very clear on explaining the issue, giving us confidence, very polite and empathetic towards our concerns. Also, we felt that the clinic is equipped with the best skilled nursing staffs and support staff who guide us at every step and never we were left alone with any doubts. We are forever obliged to Dr. Manju Nair and the staff at cloudnine. Thank you for your excellent service !!",

She is extremely clear on each step of the treatment and gives correct advice based on vast experience she gained over the years. She values time and sticks to a very planned approach to all her patients. There was never a dull movement with her and she always gives confidence to achieve success. I would  suggest anyone having infertility related problems, not to spend your time and money with any other doctor, and only consult Dr Manju to start your treatment. She is a divine blessing for all who want to step into the dream world of parenting.",

From the day one she makes you feel comfortable and connects well with your past journey. At every step of the treatment she offers best possible and practical options but asks you to take a final call. She is very much clear & practical in her treatment with minimum medication. She always provides prompt advice in emergency situations on whatsapp/call. Last but not the least is the humble and very efficient staff at cloudnine. Together as a team they make this tough journey really smooth.We are actually on cloudnine after receiving our good news. All thanks to Dr. Manju Nair & cloudnine team. We wish they continue converting more struggling couples into happy parents. More power to them!!",

She is one of the most confident and efficient doctors I have met, but at the same time easy to talk to. She supported us throughout the process by even responding to queries on WhatsApp. Her team and staff are equally helpful! Thank you would be very small word to express what she has achieved! ",

Her level of commitment and overall her humanity to treat her patients as comfortable and positive as possible is no match to anyone I have encountered so far. The day I visited her I knew that something positive is going to happen in our life. After trying for a kid through various doctors and well known hospitals for 3 years, I was able to conceive in the first try with Dr. Manju Nair. There\u2019s so much positive vibe each time you meet her. She makes you feel comfortable and heard everytime you go to her with any of your silly problems. Anyone who\u2019s in and around Old airport road, do not search no more, this is the place for you to make your dreams come true. Thank you is extremely underrated to say to Dr. Manju Nair.

Thing is sometimes we know why the things are not falling into place, but unless some realisation comes to your mind, you won't get motivated. Me and my husband met the doctor for my PCOS problem and infertility. She patiently listened all the things then make me understand why things are not working properly with reasonable logics. She asked me to go for weightless. Now you might think every doc tells the same thing to TTC couples, what is the new thing. But her approach was quite self awakening. she suggested not to live in fantasy world *** ******* ** ******** Until unless you help your body none can help you. Moral of the story is she is quite reasonable and does not go for unnecessary treatments with false hope. She is quite honest and justifies her approach with reasonable facts. Those who are TTC couple for long time if they want honest solution without false hope, visit her soon. the sooner the better.",

She explains the possibilities & treatment options and lets you decide on it. And once you have opted for it, she takes full responsibility & does whatever is best for the patient. She is quite responsive (even reachable over whatsapp). She didn't hurried us into all the expensive treatments, but tried through the course of treatments suitable for us, with lots of care, support and gave hope to us, in our difficult times. Keep up the good work, Dr. Nair and team and all the very best!!",

After visiting multiple famous fertility centers and almost loosing hope, Dr. Manju came as ray of hope for us. Her very clear thoughts, transparency and caring nature gave us motivation to go ahead with treatment. Her very straight forward nature is something that stands out as she never suggests any unnecessary tests or treatment and will never give you any false promises. Her immense experience of so many years shows in the way she handles each case so carefully and differently. It was like god's extended helping hand, treatment was successful and now I am experiencing the magical feeling of being pregnant and happily waiting for the little one to come in my arms. All doctors treat but a good doctor cares and that's what Dr. Manju does. I cannot thank enough Dr. Manju even if I keep thanking her throughout my life. ",

She is sad when her patients are sad and she celebrates when her patients are happy. Her entire staff also does a commendable job. They remember each and every details about their patients and always so ready to help. Very caring and understanding. People always say that you need to be stress free and happy to see a positive result. But here the doctor and the nurse don't just merely say that, they create such an environment that you are automatically positive and happy. ",

The entire team just works wonderfully to create a optimal system which works in favour of the patients. You would not find a better clinic for fertility treatment in Bangalore. Everything is \"the best\" with Dr. Manju Nair and team. We are blessed to have her guidance and medical expertise in our infertility journey..",

Just in the first meet we felt very positive seeing so many testimonials and photos there with all happy faces and after meeting Doctor our confidence went up. She chose the right treatment for us, was open enough to discuss any doubts or questions we had and finally made us see the MAGICAL SECOND PINK LINE after 6 long years of wait. She definitely has the magical touch, and all the sisters and staff were very friendly throughout. I would recommend Dr.Manju Nair from Cloudnine fertility, OAR for couples longing to see magic in their life :)",

The moment we met the doctor, we could feel her aura and immediately we felt we are in the safe hands. Without any second thought, we decided to start our treatment. We had so much of confusion around the process. Dr. Manju Nair clarified all our doubts, explained the process in detail. We were awestruck with her professionalism. We have never come across any doctor with such dedication. I would say she is an epitome of professionalism and dedication. She never keeps any questions unanswered. She is very much approachable. We always found solution to our queries whenever we approached her. We felt so comfortable and relaxed with every visit.",

Her personal investment in achieving the best outcomes is really appreciated. Would recommend doctor to anyone looking for infertility treatment and suggest trust and to follow instructions till the end. Thanks to doctor, nurses and all cloud nine staff for making this work out for us.",

The staff is also very helpful, and very well organized. Before any critical procedure step, they used to call and help me get organized with clear instructions.  I finally managed to get pregnant, and my pregnancy is progressing well, all thanks to her. I would very highly recommend her, if you have infertility issues, please go to her- she is absolutely fantastic and brilliant. ",

Before coming to Dr. Manju Nair, we met few other fertility expert in the city, but all were unsuccessful and in that process we lost our confidence and hope. Finally we got to know about cloudnine and Dr. Manju Nair through one of our friend. Dr. Manju didn't promise sky from the very beginning, she only asked us to trust on her treatment and God. Then we decided to continue with her looking at her and hospital's track record. The entire process and journey with Dr. Manju Nair was quite a eventful one. Though we had a miscarriage after our first pregnancy, but the second attempt was a successful one. Now I am under the treatment of a gynaecologist in same cloudnine and my pregnancy is stable and smooth till now. As a couple we are really thankful to the expertise of Dr. Manju Nair and the staffs of cloudnine. Hope they will continue their noble job of giving hope to the ones like us.

Her positivity is so contagious that we walk out of the hospital every time with so much confidence and positive thoughts. She is very inspiring as a person.\n\nA special mention to the staff. Always friendly and warm and create a very wonderful environment which helps patients to be comfortable. \n\nI definitely urge people to meet Dr. Manju Nair for any help required. ",

When I took a decision of consulting someone else, Dr. Manju's name came at the top on web. She was super quick in identifying my pregnancy and referred to the right doctor. My life was saved as pregnancy was abnormal and it needed to be terminated which happened super quick with her references. She also helped in conceiving post this termination as I have a history of endometriosis. We went through 1 cycle of IVF which turned positive in the first cycle itself. She guided us well and was available all the time to discuss and help. She understands patient well and provides necessary support. Thanks to her help & guidance and thorough knowledge that today, I am a mother of twin girls. \n",

Fortunately, Practo has assisted us in finding a solution to our problem. That's when we came across Dr. Manju Nair who's been relentlessly helping us throughout this journey. Even though the 1st IVF cycle failed, but she kept us enthusiastic and comforted.Finally, in the 2nd IVF attempt we have seen success and I was able to conceive.I would recommend Dr.Manju Nair, who is such an empathetic person and comforting personality to all the couples who are facing similar fertility issues. The entire team of cloudnine (doctor and all the nurses) were too comforting , polite , helpful and answered all our queries with patience. I am really glad to have met Dr.Manju Nair who is my guardian angel.",

All through the consultation she instilled confidence and as a result the very first IVF with her was a success! We are now hoping everything else from here goes smooth and our bundle of joy arrives healthy. The entire staff in the hospital provide the best service, they meticulously follow up through each step to ensure nothing goes wrong.

It was a long and difficult journey for us but thanks to Dr. Manju, our hopes kept alive. Its a known fact that she is quite experienced and is a distinguished and thorough professional. Its her personal side which will stay with me forever. She was ALWAYS there for me. She has a razor sharp memory and remembers everything about her patients. Just like family, she calmed my nerves, motivated me, pacified me and even scolded me once. Finally, with her meticulous treatment, I conceived. I hope everything goes well now. I'm so grateful to meet her and we are forever indebted to her. Every couple is obviously different, but one will definitely get the best treatment and care with Dr. Manju and her great team of sisters.",

First time when I met mam,I was so tensed .Mam made me realise and make me understand the issue clearly and gave me a promise that,you will be mom soon. After meeting mam I felt so relaxed and my hopes about my pregnancy had been increased. After a lot of struggles ,finally at present I am pregnant and I am so happy .Thanks to Dr.Manju nair who really supported me and gave me confidence when I am feeling low. I have to mention about the staff and their warm welcome when ever I visit hospital. I really feel so comfortable. My special thanks to Kavitha (nurse),who is always there as a sister to guide me at every aspect .I am always thankful to the entire Cloud nine staff in making my dream come true\ud83d\ude0d. I am always thankful to Dr.Manju nair mam for giving me a wonderful gift for my life. Words are not enough to express my feelings. Just follow mam suggestions definitely we will come out with flying colours. ",

Dr guided well in all  cases as we had to met doctor from genetic departement due to family history.\n\nDr asked us to wait till all the reports are clear and not to impact our baby. In the mean while Dr asked my wife to reduce weight and suggested some weight loss program that helped her to reduce with proper diet control and no slippage in exercise.\n\nDr treatement, positive words kept us pushing through all the hurdles and even after pregnancy Dr guided us to the right gynacelogist to make our long desire fruitful.\n\nWe are really happy to share feedback about the Dr. I would recommend the doctor to  anyone having issues in getting pregnant. But you need to trust the Dr constantly.\n\nThank you so much  Dr. Manju Nair!!!",

We were wanting a baby and where really confused which Doctor to go to we initially went to another doctor for first consultation but due to some reason he was leaving that hospital to another hospital so we decided to change our consultation to Dr. Manju Nair. Thanks to our lucky stars she turned out to be a very good Doctor. She is very patient and friendly. Clears all our doubts. She goes extramile to ensure that all our apprehensions are cleared and help us getting into a positive mindset. She is to the point and clear in her communications. We are so blessed that my wife got conceived in our very first IUI and we are expecting our little bundle for joy in next few months.  Highly recommend Dr. Manju Nair and her team.  And take this opportunity to thank her from bottom of our heart. ",
