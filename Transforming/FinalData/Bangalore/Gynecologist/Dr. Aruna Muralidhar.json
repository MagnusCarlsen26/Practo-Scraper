In my second month, I took GTT test. Sugar was in border so I wasn't on strict diet. But doctor insisted that we do sugar monitoring daily, and shockingly it was spiking out of normal range. We tried to control it with diet and only ended up in frustration. She directed us to endocrinologist and dietician to start proper treatment. With insulin, I was able to eat peacefully. She was encouraging me to do prenatal yoga throughout my pregnancy. I would say it's a boon. With yoga, I was very active and pain free. In my 7th month scan, baby's abdominal circumference value and overall weight was less and baby was having IUGR. Every 2 weeks, she asked me to do scan and NST to keep close monitoring of baby wellbeing. She suggested appropriate medicines to help with baby growth. She was focused more on getting this pregnancy to full term. In my 37th week, AFI was also low so we had to induce the labour. I was very scared how it will go. But Aruna mam made sure that it's smooth normal delivery and baby is also fine. We owe a lot to her throughout our pregnancy. She was taking the right steps at the right time to get things going. We are glad that we chose Aruna doctor.",

In my second month, I took GTT test. Sugar was in border so I wasn't on strict diet. But doctor insisted that we do sugar monitoring daily, and shockingly it was spiking out of normal range. We tried to control it with diet and only ended up in frustration. She directed us to endocrinologist and dietician to start proper treatment. With insulin, I was able to eat peacefully. She was encouraging me to do prenatal yoga throughout my pregnancy. I would say it's a boon. With yoga, I was very active and pain free. In my 7th month scan, baby's abdominal circumference value and overall weight was less and baby was having IUGR. Every 2 weeks, she asked me to do scan and NST to keep close monitoring of baby wellbeing. She suggested appropriate medicines to help with baby growth. She was focused more on getting this pregnancy to full term. In my 37th week, AFI was also low so we had to induce the labour. I was very scared how it will go. But Aruna mam made sure that it's smooth normal delivery and baby is also fine. We owe a lot to her throughout our pregnancy. She was taking the right steps at the right time to get things going. We are glad that we chose Aruna doctor.",

She would always welcome us with a smile in every visit which is very comforting to start with. Post observation, she mentions her current assessment and then explains to us the reason behind a certain test or a scan or a treatment that she may recommend on the need basis. She guided me very well at each stage of pregnancy and was very caring throughout the journey.\n\n\n\nFurther, very importantly, she gives enough space for us to clarify any of our queries. Even if we, sometimes, ask more doubts or queries, she would address each of them without any iota of showing frustration, hurriedness, or impatience - this is becoming a rare quality for the doctors, especially among the gynaecologists/obstetricians these days and we really appreciate the doctor for that. Post consultation, we always felt that we are well-informed, and that clarity has given us a lot of confidence and comfort. We really appreciate the doctor for this. For us, this was one of the key factors of choosing a gynaecologist apart from the doctor\u2019s expertise. \n\n\n\nDuring our regular visits, she got a slight doubt on an aspect during my 33rd week of pregnancy and she proactively took steps in suggesting us to get a scan done, the findings of which corroborated her doubt with a small issue. So, she closely monitored me regularly and guided us accordingly until delivery. I delivered a healthy baby boy via normal delivery mode (using forceps instrument). The delivery process had become slightly complicated due to baby\u2019s facing/position and that is when we are glad to have the situation dealt by an expert and experienced doctor who was ably supported by her team of junior doctor and nurses. Labor pains are very painful and stressful for anyone and an extended labor duration in my case was even more painful and stressful - but I got excellent support and motivation from the doctor and her team - they were very caring. Immediately after the delivery as well, I was stressed and very tired (partly also due to slightly more blood loss during the delivery) - Doctor addressed this situation deftly.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we are glad that, in Dr. Aruna, we found best of both worlds - an expert who is very caring - which enabled us to feel confident, comfortable and that we are in safe hands. We are grateful to the doctor and would like to express our gratitude towards her for taking care of each stage of my pregnancy and a complicated delivery process so well. We are very happy for welcoming a baby boy to our family!\n\n",

Doctor was the kindest throughout the entire process and her dedication to her patients is unparalleled. From the moment I met her, I felt at ease knowing I was in capable hands. She patiently addressed all of my concerns, providing thorough explanations and thoughtful guidance at every step.  \n\nWhat truly impressed me was Doctor's commitment to ensuring the best possible outcome for myself and my baby during labour. When I expressed my desire for a normal delivery, she remained attentive to all potential complications that may arise and had a comprehensive plan in place, including the availability of necessary medical staff during labour. She's the sweetest person to talk to who always has a smile on her face and I miss meeting her and talking to her. I had a wonderful time during all my visits due to her and an amazing normal delivery experience with doctors guidance and support during labour. I was very well looked after during the entire labour process and after delivery. \n\nThanks to Doctor and I am incredibly grateful for her exceptional care and would highly recommend her to anyone seeking a compassionate and skilled obstetrician.\n\n",

Dr Aruna is the very friendly and explains everything during the treatment. Our reason for seeing her was a long term approach about having kids. My treatment started with the PCOS and a little later we started planning for kids. Having PCOS I had been given little hopes before by my friends and family. I am really thankful to ma'am and to my luck that we reached her. Ma'am treatment approach was a long term one and it paid off. I am now a mother to a healthy boy and that too by normal delivery, all thanks to Dr Aruna. The treatment was a step by step plan with ma'am explaining each and every step along the way. It was a long time to reach the end goal but whenever someone says that its a short treatment with results very soon should not fully believe them. Aruna ma'am took all the necessary treatment and a systematic approach with atleast 2 or 3 cycles where we  tried with normal approach to get conceived. I was finally able to conceive with ovulation induction. I liked the most that there was no unneccessary treatment or tests that were conducted or even any unrequired approach for the ovulation. During the initial days ma'am was able to pick up the fact that my sugars were a notch above normal and was accurately about to diagnose gestational diabetes at around the 35th week, which the doctor expected in the first trimester looking at the slight change in the sugars. I call that experience. I followed up with ma'am throughout the pregnancy but there was a complication with the shorting of the cervix which led to me having to undergo cervical cerclage. I underwent the emergency surgery in the able hands of Dr Aruna, who took the utmost care and urgency to do the surgery which was successful. I feel, my husband and I have shared our most exciting wait with the ups and downs during this journey with the strongest support of Dr Aruna. She was beside us during the best and the worse part of it. Finally in the delivery room giving the all needed patience and encouragement for the hours of labour and finally the joy of bringing a life into the world. Heartfelt thank you to ma'am for everything.",

The professional here in question, Dr. Aruna Muralidhar is  someone I adore as a doctor from day one, she\u2019s quite professional, rather focused on her work and diagnosis, uses her heart too (one feels cared for rather than being just another patient medical file no); is a gorgeous human being! Having to deal with a difficult pregnancy immediately with marriage, and having had extreme sickness with it, she\u2019s helped me cope with the huge mental stress and the myriad of symptoms; plus all the physical exhaustion that came through these months so far. I still have a long way to go, but in my heart I have faith that it\u2019ll all going to be okay with my health and our little one in her hands. She gives me hope and reassurance. \nHer communication is clear and brilliant and she bothers to let you ask queries at length which is a rare quality and a must have for all doctors in today\u2019s day and age where most are dismissive or authoritative. Simply put when a patient understands the situation better, he/she copes better because of the feeling of retained selfcontrol. She bothers to explain along with speaking about options and solutions. She doesn\u2019t bully you in to \u2018bearing\u2019 some routine gynac probing procedure but instead talks you through your discomfort. She also lets you choose what you would want for yourself where treatment options are concerned. She isn\u2019t rude while responding to an anxious family member but accommodates for that in a visit. Restores my belief in the old school tradition that you can trust your doctor implicitly next to your family. I pray her colleagues and juniors learn from her and she is empowered with all the strength and luck to keep at what she does. ",

We consulted Dr. Aruna all through my pregnancy journey and she has been a boon for us as she gave us the best advice at every step. Especially, in the third trimester - Dr. Aruna gave us the timely advice to opt for a c-section due to some unforeseen complications. She handled the procedure remarkably well and ensured that both the mother and baby were safe. Very grateful to Dr. Aruna and would always recommend her to every couple that is getting ready to be parents.",

Situation's make everyone to be panic at times during the pregnancy journey... Even we went through same during 3 months of my pregnancy but she gave us positive directions, with her timely lab tests and suggestions made us very strong and ended up with healthy pregnancy with no complications at all... She is not only a doctor but a very good friend and supportive piller when it comes to pregnancy..... She always answered our queries timely through her consultations or through whats app when ever we needed.. She have much much patience to listen to you, understand you then look up to solutions... She cares more than  parents for a baby to be healthy.....without a second thought i would say Aruna mam is one of the best gynic i have ever seen... I would like to say thank you so much mam.... I wish Mam that Lord Saibaba bless her with good health and serve more and more people... Om Sri Sairam.... ",

She explained the next steps with a lot of patience and was open to answering all our questions no matter how small. She also conducts online group sessions with her pregnant patients (and their partners) where she gives out the guidelines for daily routines such as diet, exercise, rest, work etc and again clears all our doubts. She conducts more detailed workshops regarding labor etc for women who are further in their pregnancy. I hope to attend these at a later stage. These workshops save quite a lot of time during the consultation and also helps us understand Dr. Aruna's methods and style of care. Overall we've had a good experience with Dr. Aruna Muralidhar.",

I had a low lying placenta and had spotting in the first semester because of which we were very anxious about the pregnancy. We also had potential gestational diabetes (GD) during third trimester. She helped us navigate through the potentially risky journey by taking nothing for granted and making no assumptions. She always maintained a close watch on all the numbers and helped calm our anxieties by showing us our progress towards normalcy. Because of her experience she could tell us whether the progress was good or not and diligently walked us through dos and donts in case things weren\u2019t getting better. For example, she gave me a very simple diet guidance for managing the GD and helped me understand why a particular diet plan was needed and why it would work (and it did work- my weight had gone up from 67 in month one to 81 in month 7 and later stabilised at 80 by 9th month). Thanks to her we had a healthy 3.5 kg baby and I also had a speedy recovery after delivery. Her pleasant countenance and calming demeanour are a cherry on the top.",

She has delivered both my babies and the second delivery was an emergency c section however even on a Saturday night she took less than 45 minutes to come to the hospital after I called her and was there like an angel ready to perform my surgery. I remember feeling super anxious because I wasn\u2019t seeing her around when I was at the hospital yet when I saw her coming into the OT i breathed a sigh of relief and hearing her voice just calmed me down so much ! I held her hand while the anasthesia was being administered and she joked about it saying I nearly broke her thumb but that\u2019s how tightly I held onto her because all my trust was in her \u2665\ufe0f She was cheerful and smiling and helped me recover so well! Doctors are angels sent by God and doctor Aruna is definitely one of His special ones :) Thank you so much doctor you\u2019ll always be remembered by us life long \u2665\ufe0f \nWith lots of love,\nDeepak and Manisha ",

Her advises were so selfless which was always fruitful to me. Till my 39th week, I had no contractions & pain then mam advised to wait for active labour pain rather than inducing pains. She especially took her time out to call me & explained me the nitty & gritty. Then after one day, I started with the contractions. At 4 O' Clock in the morning, pain was unbearable then we rushed to the hospital. It was informed to mam, she gave valuable guidances time to time. As suggested by mam, my water was broken at 6:30 am which suddenly initiated my labour process faster. She was a man of her words that her encouragement for normal delivery from consultation till delivery was phenomenal. Her approach towards the whole process was ultimate. Finally, when my contractions were at peak, mam rushed to the delivery room & started with the process. She & her team did a incredible job by encouraging & motivating me throughout the entire journey. With their support, I finally pushed & delivered. Hats off to mam for her protocols. We are really blessed to have you as our doctor. \nThank you so much mam for your valuable advises, timely suggestions & utmost care.\n",

By God's Grace we come to know about Aruna Muralidhar and finally we met her at Fortis and shree clinic. She is incredible,soft spoken, down to earth and make us feel comfortable for every appointment. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment and clarified all of my questions. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. Under Madam guidance we follwed her suggestions in my entire pregency and finally my delivery went smooth and delivered Baby this November..my all worries gone away it's all because of one person \"Aruna Muralidhar\".\nThank you Madam thank you Fortis and team.\nI highly recommend this doctor becoming her patient!.",

My whole pregnancy journey was smooth because she was calm but also thorough if there were any concerns. We had certain requests for the birth like skin to skin, breastfeeding right after delivery and my husband cutting the cord and she noted it all in our birth plan and made everything happen. She was very pro normal delivery even when I was exciting a big baby, during contractions when the pain was too much and I asked to just finish with a C section she refused and asked me to be patient. She kept checking up on me and was always encouraging. She had a great team and I felt in safe hands during the birth and was well informed of everything happening and when the baby wasn't coming out easily she used a vacuum and delivered a beautiful baby girl in May 2019. Everything was very professional and efficient. So in summary I had a great, transparent and stress free experience with Dr Aruna and would highly recommend her. ",

My husband and I moved to Bangalore from our hometown. Dr. Aruna checked my file and studied it well. As I am a first time mom she was approachable and very friendly. She cleared all the doubts and explained everything clearly to us. She also gets involved closely with all her patients and knows their case and names. Unfortunately, I had to go through an emergency C section and Dr. Aruna wasn't in town but despite that, once she got to know about me, she followed up with the hospital to check on me and as soon as she was back, she came to visit me in the hospital. She came to check on me everyday without fail and helped me recover better. She closely monitored my stitches and made sure that it was healing well. She kept a close check on me and my baby who was admitted for few days in the NICU. I am very grateful to her for all that she did for me. I strongly recommend her to all new and old moms. ",

Unfortunately, she had missed miss-carries 5 years before.\nWe were consulting with a Dr in some other Hospital for first 6 weeks. But we could have enough confidence to continue there.\n\nI would say we were just lucky that we booked with Dr Aruna Muralidhar. She checked all reports from previous Hospital and suggested to start thyroid medicine immediately.   She talked to my wife in detail to know health history and also helped her to manage her anxiety level. Soon after few visits we knew we are in very safe hands. \n\nIn last trimester\u2019s scan she found that baby is not growing as per standard growth rate, she told us she might need to induce the labor, however she was able to manage this by some medicine and in next week baby\u2019s growth was better.\n\nDue to my wife\u2019s health problems I always used to think there will be C-Section,  but Dr made it normal delivery.  Next day Dr came and after checkup said she is going to discharge us. \n\nWe were discharged within 24 hours after the delivery. It was unbelievable for us Normal delivery, everything fine with baby and then discharged within 24 hours. \n\nShe is the best doctor we ever met.  Thank you so much Dr Aruna.",

We blindly trusted and followed her advice starting from first visit and never felt like we wanted anything more. She is transparent, to the point, crystal clear in communication and a confidence booster. She also promptly responded to messages when we had some queries. Our parents and in laws were very happy to see doctor who is down to earth and approachable. We were blessed with baby on 1st of January through normal delivery which was in fact little complex as baby weight was above average and the process took almost entire day having admitted to hospital in the morning and delivery close to midnight. Doctor followed up all through the day and hospital staff  executed every decision as per doctor\u2019s advice. She was in labour room till end  and ensured smooth delivery which also gave all of us confidence  and peace of mind.Overall, we strongly recommend Dr. Aruna Muralidhar and will definitely refer her to our family and friends.Thanks,Poojashree & Prathap ",

I call the hospital and they tell me doctor is not available at 2 45pm hence the rescheduling. Even though I stay 25kms away I still managed to reach at 12: 05 pm. The receptionist Jone Nancy is probably the most inefficient and rude person ever. She had a pregnant woman hanging around her desk for nearly 15 mins while she chatted away on the phone and her colleagues . after registration I waited another 20mins, saw the doctor walk out of her cabin , another 5mins later a nurse comes up to me and tells me the duty doctor will see me since Dr Aruna had to leave and she'll be back only at 2pm. Doctor left to take interviews as Nancy told us, after having made a pregnant patient travel 25kms to meet her and making her wait another 40 mins at the hospital. I was left in tears after taking all the physical exertion and pain for nothing. **** ******** *** ********* ******** *** * ******** ** ********* ",

Doctor was so friendly and had lot of patience to listen to our concerns and complains,and would able to give us the best possible solution when ever there was a doubts.  doctor made sure it was nothing to worry about it. After my first tremester I had urine infections, this basically happened due to fibriods, during this period the doctor gave us much hope and motivation that it won't cause much touble during pregnancy. Finally the infections and blockages we're finally gone and got cured. thanks to Doctor again, after every visits and consultation or during lab tests, scanning sessions the Doctor would analyse the reports give us appropriate prescriptions medicines. Overall everything went all right and fine. Thanks to Doctor Again. Entire process and journey was great. Though the doctor tried her best for normal delivery. However due to fibriod and heart rate of the baby was less. My delivery had to be C section. But The way doctor and the team handled was something phenomenal I could understand their only intention is to save both of us, me and baby. And they did it. I am so glad and grateful for the doctor and the team consisting of Doctor Shreedhar and others. For this wonderful motherhood. \nMore importantly the hospital and staffs from nurses to other members they were all friendly and helpful.   \n\n Thanks Doctor Aruna Murlidhar.  \n10 out of 10. ",

You can get a sense of her knowledge in just one visit. She speaks very politely and we can ask our doubts without hesitation. She made us understand my medical condition & what precautions need to be taken. Under her supervision, we had a successful delivery of the baby although there were medical complications with unexpected labour. Post delivery, she made sure that I am keeping well and if my overall health is all good. I cannot thank her enough & I will be forever grateful. Highly recommend her. You are in safe hands if with her. Last but not the least, Nine Months - The journey  of a lifetime by Dr. Aruna is so insightful & a must read for all adults. \ud83d\ude0a",

In addition, she is available by more than one means: be it her e-mails, Whatsapp, in-clinic consultation or video consultations. And finally a cheerleader when it comes to the labour room.

She also guided us well about pain management options and at no point forced any option on us. A big big thank you to her for making this journey so amazing! Recommend her 100% to anyone whose looking for a gynaecologist whose practical, open minded and would not impose restrictions unnecessarily. ",

I highly appreciate her priorities, dedication and promptness towards her patients.\n\nI would not have possibly prepared myself for a normal delivery, if not for her guidance, encouragement and support right from the beginning, in terms of medicine, mental well-being, health and parenting.\n\nTo be honest, her prescribed medications, tests and scans for me was very limited. \n\nShe has been very valuable to us.\nThankful to almighty that I choose her as my doctor.\n\n",

She gave me confidence to overcome the problems. I appreciate her for ******* ********* *** dedication towards her profession. The trust I had on her made me to deliver healthy baby even crossing all my pregnancy problems. The smile on her face and her warm welcoming are the qualities which makes the patients feel comfortable.

At the same time, she drives the point that each one of us should ultimately feel deeply responsible for our own health.

And I can't thanks Tanvi enough!\nI had uterine polyp and was advised Hysterectomy by (hyper) gynecologists both in Nagpur and Bengaluru.She was the only gynecologist who gave me an option of Hysteroscopy. She was absolutely calm...a trait a patient seeks the most when you know surgery is inevitable....a thorough professional, i can say this because the routine internal examination did not cause any unease.\nI was at crossroads because a gynecologist i had earlier met had recommended ' abdominal hysterectomy' as I am asthmatic!\nDr Aruna Murlidhar however suggested laprascopic hysterectomy and cleared any doubts i harboured.\nDr Aruna Murlidhar is the bee's knees when it comes to gynecological treatment.\nThanks a million Doctor \ud83d\ude0a",

She and her amazing team at Fortis La Femme motivated us constantly during labour and ensured that we had a normal delivery even though we ourselves felt like giving up. Having witnessed her skill and expertise first hand, especially during delivery, we feel blessed and lucky that she was the one who brought our baby boy to this world safely.

Through her guidance and support we conceived and recently delivered a baby girl through normal vaginal delivery. A big thanks to Dr.Aruna and her team at Fortis La Femme for making this happen. \n\nLike every birth story, mine too had complications. Her team had to induce labour since the fluid levels dropped at my 39th week of pregnancy. After 40+ hours of labour I lost hope for vaginal delivery. Though the doctor was not in town she promptly guided us and encouraged me to wait for one more night. She was confident that we are going to try for vaginal delivery until the baby is doing fine.  The next day morning Dr. Aruna delivered my beautiful baby girl. Kudos to her and her team at fortis for their judicious decision. \n\nI highly recommend Dr.Aruna and you can be at peace that you are in safe hands. \n\nThank you again Doctor for making this possible :) \n\n",

At one point, my husband also suggested that we will go for C sec if the pain is too much but the doctor insisted that if normal delivery is possible then we should go for it. Finally, I delivered a baby boy after her encouragement and support. I strongly recommend Doctor Aruna Muralidhar for safe and peaceful journey of pregnancy.",

I had two recurrent pregnancy loss consecutively so we didn\u2019t want to go for a surgery to expel the remains. After explaining my whole situation, Dr.Aruna understood and got to resolution very quickly that was apt for me . She suggested that it is possible to expel only with medications and surgery won\u2019t be necessary. As I am just 24 years old and overweight she advised me to reduce my weight and that might be one of the reason for my recurring miscarriages. I really feel blessed as Dr.Aruna doesn\u2019t prescribe unnecessary medications or procedures. She treats her patients as family from day 1 of consultation. Completely satisfied with her approach . I had consulted many doctors from last 2 years but I feel Dr.Aruna is the best I have met so far . She gives you the right motivation required and for me her positive vibe heals .",

Even fetal MRI was not able to detect that but Dr. Aruna Muralidhar and team did wonders and handled the complicated procedure well, stopping blood loss (after loosing almost 3.5 liters) and saved the life of my daughter.\nWe entire family are so much thankful to Dr. Aruna and the team, and Fortis hospital for their timely, appropriate and expertise medical treatment.

During the pregnancy time when situation turned abnormal she gave a lot of confidence and care to sail through the tough phase and turned it to be a normal pregnancy.

Her approach was for normal delivery as preference which was most suited for us as well. She was very welcoming for any queries and follow ups. Immense respect for the doctor in the way she handled everything. For any future consultations too, we wouldnt have to think even for a second. Highly recommended for anyone going through similar stages. Thank you immensely doctor for all your efforts, that helped us with a new born. ",

Being a doctor they have to listen patiently to the problems but as soon as I visit any doctor they ask for the problem and prescribe medicines. But after seeing reviews and feedback given for Aruna mam I wanted to give a try because I had many issues and doctor consultation was much needed. I was a little nervous about my health condition as well. As soon as I stepped into the cabin mam smile was so generous that it makes you feel comfortable and then she asked for all my problems and listened to them very patiently and suggested to cure them in a natural way instead of medicines. In case if there is any appointment delay or cancellation mam messages personally and let us know in advance which by far no doctor does. She is the best doctor I have visited till date and I recommend her strongly for everyone with gynaec issues. The best part is doctor receives you in such a way you forget about all your worries. Thanks mam for being so patient and humble.",

She asked detailed questions about my health and reproductive plans before we agreed on Mirena. She was non-judgemental, patient and professional which I'm really grateful for. I'd highly recommend her.",

On interacting with her just once,  She's so detail oriented, she took a lot of time understand my health history, family history, what needs to be taken care of and what needs to be thoroughly and timely monitored. We faced a couple of hiccups during our journey which did get us worried, but Dr. Aruna Muralidhar was always there to explain everything very patiently and transparently, to always keep us positive, to guide us properly, to decide & execute appropriate medical approach. Indeed one of the best doctors that we were fortunate to come in contact with. My best wishes to her.",

She was very friendly  and gave us some valuable advice and didn't not suggest alternate ways to get pregnant right off the bat and advised we try naturally which we followed and finally convinced in Nov-19. She has been very supportive  from day 1 as the pregnancy was a bit hard on my wife right from the start with extreme morning sickness, which got her hospitalised twice. Dr Aruna was on the same page with us on delivering natural but due to unforseen circumstances during labour we had go  with a c section. She explained the situation very well and instilled trust in us and today we are blessed with a baby girl thanks to her and the  team of doctors and nurses of fortis la femme who have been very kind and attentive.",

She advised my mother to undergo Biopsy and asked us to visit her at Fortis as this facility is not available at the clinic. The doctor spoke to my mother in the language that she knows (Kannada). She made her comfortable throughout the procedure. The procedure took about 10 min, the doctor engaged my mother in a conversation so that she would feel the whole process less painful. She is very professional and a friendly doctor.",

Then came the real surprise where during my examination suddenly the Dr. inserted an instrument for pap-smear. I didn't know what was happening. I was administered a test without my permission and without informing me. For this I jad to pay another 1500 bucks or so.I'm absolutely not happy with this experience.with regards to my diagnosis, it was fine. ",

She is very clear in what she recommends and there will be no second thoughts about it.

Problems are hard to face for anyone but having a good doctor makes it less worrisome and sometimes less painful. ",

She was very patient to listen to my concern and she did a lot of probing asking the right kind of questions very politely and did a thorough check up to reach to a conclusion. It was the first time when I was so satisfied with a gynecologist and was sure that I'm in right hands. Unfortunately I could not continue with the treatment as I had to move to Delhi. And now I'm in Delhi where I have visited a few female gynecologists for the same concern but no one seems to be well versed or experienced enough to treat it. Would really appreciate Dr. Aruna if you could recommend me to someone in Delhi who is as efficient as you to treat it. It would be a big favor as u can understand how it's affecting me. Thanks in advance! Will wait for your email. \n",

Rather she asked me to take certain medicines and to follow diet and exercise which will make the values come in the normal range.
