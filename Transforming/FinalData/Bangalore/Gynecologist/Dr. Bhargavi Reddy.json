Unfortunately, my experience with the service provided by Dr. Reddy was extremely disappointing.\n\nFirst and foremost, I was taken aback by the doctor's behavior, which I found to be completely unacceptable. *** ***** **** ****** ** ********** *** ****** ** ******* * ***** *********** ** ** ****** ********* *** ************* *** ************** *** ** ****** ************ I felt uncomfortable with the way she addressed my concerns as an unmarried woman. *** **** ** *********** **** ******** *** ********** ***********.\n\nWhat added to my disappointment was the lack of information provided about my condition. Dr. Reddy did not take the time to explain the nature of my infection or the reasons behind my symptoms. Instead, she swiftly prescribed medication without any detailed explanation. This left me feeling uninformed and unsure about my treatment plan.\n\nFurthermore, the doctor's approach to follow-up care was lacking. After prescribing the medication, Dr. Reddy simply instructed me to return for a follow-up appointment after a week, without providing any further guidance or support.\n\nOverall, my experience with Dr. Bhargavi Reddy at Life Plus Hospital was disheartening, and I would not recommend her services to anyone seeking compassionate and informative medical care. I believe that a patient's well-being should be treated with respect and empathy, qualities that were sorely lacking in this encounter. I hope that the hospital takes steps to address these issues and improve the quality of care provided to patients in the future.",

But, she must give little time to understand her patients to make them more comfortable. Also, there should be more privacy to treat a patient and not in an open space inforont of anyone coming in and going out. \nOtherwise, the hospital is nice and I am sure the doctor also must be very good and experienced, but in our case we did not get too many opportunities to interact with the doctor.",

One can freely share all the concerns with her and her colleague Dr. Indrani who is present with her on most occasions. \nThe major concern is the staff especially at the reception desk. They need to be proactive and organised in managing appointments. The nurses are very helpful and friendly. There are admin staff who are always trying to keep a check on how things are going on. Waiting time is longer and there is no preference for practo appointments. Hoping to see the improvement in facilities and coordination between the lab staff and reception desk.\n",

Unfortunately, my experience with the service provided by Dr. Reddy was extremely disappointing.\n\nFirst and foremost, I was taken aback by the doctor's behavior, which I found to be completely unacceptable. *** ***** **** ****** ** ********** *** ****** ** ******* * ***** *********** ** ** ****** ********* *** ************* *** ************** *** ** ****** ************ I felt uncomfortable with the way she addressed my concerns as an unmarried woman. *** **** ** *********** **** ******** *** ********** ***********.\n\nWhat added to my disappointment was the lack of information provided about my condition. Dr. Reddy did not take the time to explain the nature of my infection or the reasons behind my symptoms. Instead, she swiftly prescribed medication without any detailed explanation. This left me feeling uninformed and unsure about my treatment plan.\n\nFurthermore, the doctor's approach to follow-up care was lacking. After prescribing the medication, Dr. Reddy simply instructed me to return for a follow-up appointment after a week, without providing any further guidance or support.\n\nOverall, my experience with Dr. Bhargavi Reddy at Life Plus Hospital was disheartening, and I would not recommend her services to anyone seeking compassionate and informative medical care. I believe that a patient's well-being should be treated with respect and empathy, qualities that were sorely lacking in this encounter. I hope that the hospital takes steps to address these issues and improve the quality of care provided to patients in the future.",

But, she must give little time to understand her patients to make them more comfortable. Also, there should be more privacy to treat a patient and not in an open space inforont of anyone coming in and going out. \nOtherwise, the hospital is nice and I am sure the doctor also must be very good and experienced, but in our case we did not get too many opportunities to interact with the doctor.",

One can freely share all the concerns with her and her colleague Dr. Indrani who is present with her on most occasions. \nThe major concern is the staff especially at the reception desk. They need to be proactive and organised in managing appointments. The nurses are very helpful and friendly. There are admin staff who are always trying to keep a check on how things are going on. Waiting time is longer and there is no preference for practo appointments. Hoping to see the improvement in facilities and coordination between the lab staff and reception desk.\n",

She was clear on her decision based on the patient condition/History , We have been assisted with choice of Normal delivery and by God's Grace our delivery  happened within a day. All staffs are friendly and In-patient nurses/visiting doctors are very kind. \nOverall for pregnancy care Lifeplus is a better choice when it comes to consultation charges, reachability and experience. Thanks to all staffs , we were blessed with baby boy on 01/08/2020.\nwe see issues with Scan wait time , Frequent changes with medicine companies and Hospital environment. We suggested to improve in these areas as well. \n\nTake care\nCheers \nMr/Mrs/Jr. Subbaraman ",
