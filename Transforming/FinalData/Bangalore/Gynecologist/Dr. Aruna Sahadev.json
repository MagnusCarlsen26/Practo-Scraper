My husband and I silently followed her instructions and I am now 7 weeks pregnant. Our sincere thanks cannot be expressed in words. Not only the Doctor, but also the staff members are very friendly and helpful. We hope this will continue until I give birth to my baby.

My husband and I silently followed her instructions and I am now 7 weeks pregnant. Our sincere thanks cannot be expressed in words. Not only the Doctor, but also the staff members are very friendly and helpful. We hope this will continue until I give birth to my baby. Thank you for all the guidance and support you have given us.",

Throughout my pregnancy i was following her suggestions and she handled my case very efficiently ( i had BP issues and other early pregnancy complications). She always put me on right medications which helped me to carry a full term pregnancy and i gave birth to healthy baby girl..I can't thank her enough for giving me the boon of motherhood..And special thanks to staff especially Selvi for helping with appointments and other queriesThank you so much Aruna mam \ud83d\ude42",

Unlike other doctors who are eager to get to IVF,she made sure we exhausted other alternatives. Throughout the treatment cycle and subsequent examinations the quality of treatment was superb without unnecessary extra medication and experimentation. She was very quite and calm , listen to all problems well and above all she kept us in a positive frame of mind with his gentle demeanor and fact based discussions. \nWould like to recommend Dr Aruna 100%.",

As this is my first pregnancy and had some difficult time in my first trimester i wanted to approach my doctor directly for immergency. Doctor was annoyed to receive my call when i had called her phone because i was having high fever and not sure which medicine to take . It was after 6 pm and the clinic was closed. For immergency when clinic is closed doctor suggested me to visit motherhood hospital which is 15km far from my house which had upset me a bit thinking if my doctor (my only rescue) really cares about me or i am just one of her 100th patient. I was allowed to call her phone only if all options are rulled out. Dr. Aruna did advise me and her medicines helped me conceive for which I am grateful to her .\nFor a Dr. Aruna it's a regular job to see a patient, but for me it's my first pregnancy and everything is new, few things are scary. I wish I had little more comfort with my doctor and dint have to go for second openion. ",
