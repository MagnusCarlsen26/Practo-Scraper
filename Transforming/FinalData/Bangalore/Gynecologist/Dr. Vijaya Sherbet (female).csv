,"Menstrual Disorders in Adolescent Girls,",0,0,YES,"I just love this doctor. She is so dedicated and has great patience. Though it was the last appointment for me, she had the same interest and patience to understand and provide the right solution. 11 years back she delivered my baby and i cannot forget that. She takes care of me like a kid. So adorable person. Ma'am, you need an assistant to type and change bed sheets each time, don't take so much stress by doing everything by yourself. Hats off to your efforts. She had started her day from morning 5.30 am and still so dedicated at her work till evening 7.30 pm. She is an amazing lady with great experience. We need such doctors in life where we can trust for years together. ",2024-07-02 15:48:27,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,",0,0,YES,"This is a long overdue review of Dr. Vijaya Sherbet. She delivered my son in the month of feb 2020.
The first time i had met her was when i consulted her for my pregnancy in 2019 which unfortunately resulted in a miscarriage. But she was so positive and practical through that experience that i knew that if i was to get pregnant again she would be my doctor. A year later when i was pregnant i went back to her and i am so happy i did. She is someone i would recommend a hundred percent to any pregnant mom. *** ** ****** ************* *** *** ********* ** **** **** *** keeping up information and standards across the world. She is not someone who will mollycoddle you but at the same time she is so patient and non judgemental. She will answer all your questions with a lot of patience and practicality. Even through my delivery when things got tough i felt safe and calm because of her. She is someone i would close my eyes and go back to every single time.
I hope Dr Sherbet gets to read this because we are thankful for the entire pregnancy and delivery experience we went through because of her.

She is an asset to the organization. She will do best to her ability. We are visiting her from 1st month of pregnancy  and each visit she will do scan apart from the milestone scan.

I visited her for my fibroid and uterine bleeding problem. She patiently took time and guided me through the  Uterine Artery Embolization process along with Dr. Rajesh.

She took personal care in every step. God Bless her always. She is quite friendly. Thank you Dr. for all your time and effort.
