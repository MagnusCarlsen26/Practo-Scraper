"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"I highly recommend Dr Aarthi Bharath for pregnancy care. I visited her for my second baby pregnancy.

She was very friendly, she would answer to all our queries and concerns very well. She never recommends unnecessary medications. 

One of the best gynac in Banashankari area. She would tell her leave plans also well in advance so that we could easily plan our doctor visits accordingly. She was available on calls even during weekends if we had any issue and she would revert back to us immediately.  It was always so easy to communicate anything with her. 

Even during the surgery she made sure I was comfortable in the OT, then she started the surgery. 

Overall had a nice experience during my entire pregnancy and post pregnancy follow ups too.. ",2023-06-05 10:38:45,False,True,Chinmayi M,,,
