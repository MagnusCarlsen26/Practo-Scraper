Dr. Deepika played a very critical role in making sure my  baby and I were safe. She is a very down to earth person with great professionalism.  She is very transperant in educating her patients on the issues and cares a lot for her patients. Her calmness in listening to every problem and guiding the patients in the right way with right treatment is just commendable. Most doctors would not really worry about their patients after the delivery. But, Dr. Deepika is one such person who really cares a lot for her patients and she still kept checking on my health post my delivery. I am really thankful to have known her and I really recommend her for new moms to be. Thank you Dr.Deepika for everything!",

And she explains in layman language to understand anyone.\n\nSince we don\u2019t have a possible situation for delivery in Bangalore, we have to plan in Hyderabad. For that she co-operated and guided us in friendly nature\u2026\u2026 most of the doctors don\u2019t do that.

Dr. Deepika played a very critical role in making sure my  baby and I were safe. She is a very down to earth person with great professionalism.  She is very transperant in educating her patients on the issues and cares a lot for her patients. Her calmness in listening to every problem and guiding the patients in the right way with right treatment is just commendable. Most doctors would not really worry about their patients after the delivery. But, Dr. Deepika is one such person who really cares a lot for her patients and she still kept checking on my health post my delivery. I am really thankful to have known her and I really recommend her for new moms to be. Thank you Dr.Deepika for everything!",

And she explains in layman language to understand anyone.\n\nSince we don\u2019t have a possible situation for delivery in Bangalore, we have to plan in Hyderabad. For that she co-operated and guided us in friendly nature\u2026\u2026 most of the doctors don\u2019t do that.

My labour experience was so great inspite of the pain as she was so understanding and I felt as if someone of my own family was present with me and encouraging me. I will be forever grateful to her for giving me such a positive birth experience. I had normal delivery and I had followed all the instructions given by doctor. Highly recommended for pre natal and post natal care.  She handled my pregnancy superbly and make me comfortable at every stage. I am recommending her to all my friends.",
