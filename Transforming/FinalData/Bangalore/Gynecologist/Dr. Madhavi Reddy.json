I consulted Dr. Madhavi Reddy mam from the starting of my pregnancy career and labour. She is highly skilled, very humble, very friendly in nature and she can understand patients situation very clearly and she even responds to patients problem through watsup very thoroughly. Actually i have planned for c section delivery due to the fear of labour pains but mam suggested me to go for normal delivery and also she explained very well about the painless delivery and other types of deliveries. She has more patience and she supports me for normal delivery for one and half day and I delivered a baby girl through vaginal delivery with the support of only Madhavi mam and also mam counselled about the post delivery caring. Because of Madhavi mam, i recovered in 5 days and I am doing my normal works happily. I would highly recommend Dr. Madhavi Reddy mam for my friends and family for their better future. Thank you so much Dr. Madhavi reddy mam for your support and because of you i am so happy with my baby today. Thanks alot mam.",

                "review_text": "It was that day when my husband and I were on cloud nine as I tested positive for pregnancy. It was indeed a joyous moment and it was the time to choose the best Obstetrician to ensure the whole course of nine months of tenure and delivery of our child is in safe hands and then Google suggested us Dr. Madhavi Reddy.\n\nSo we consulted  Dr. Madhavi Reddy and I must say we  instantly knew we made the right decision; she is the best. She is a very good listener, spends lot of time interacting and listening to her patients and gives practical advice, very down to earth person and last but not the least very highly qualified in terms of practical experience. She ensured both mother and baby were doing good whenever we went for routine check-ups.\n\nDays flew by, months passed by, it was October 16th (around 9 PM) I started getting cramp like pain and I knew our baby had started making her way to this beautiful world. I waited till early morning of 17th October and then we messaged Dr. Madhavi Reddy (despite of early morning) and she replied and told us that she will reach out to emergency duty doctor. We reached hospital around 7 AM on 17th October and I was admitted without any hassle. The duty doctor visited us immediately and confirmed that I was already in labor and dilated by 3 cm. We were really excited and at the same time a bit scared. This was that time it seemed the time was in slow motion. Dr. Madhavi Reddy visited us at around 9.30 AM, spoke to us and gave courage as she told us that she will be going ahead with normal delivery (based on her experience and as there were no complications she knew the best). Slowly I started getting pains on and off. Finally when it was the time to push, the real adventure started.\nDr. confirmed that the baby is almost there and it was just the final push which was required from my end. Time was moving slowly and I was not able to push. Dr. Madhavi Reddy motivated me and assured that this was the last push which needs to be made. \nThanks to Almighty and Dr. Madhavi Reddy for the support and motivation, that final push was made and our little darling princess was delivered safely and healthily. It was a memorable and beautiful ride inside the labor room, only because we had Dr. Madhavi Reddy beside us and it was the smoothest without any hurdles or obstacles. \n\nI could bear all the pain and was enjoying this journey only because of the courage Dr. Madhavi Reddy gave me, along with the jokes we were cracking on labour bed.\n\nA big thanks to Dr. Madhavi Reddy for ensuring the safe delivery and taking care of me and our little one throughout the course of nine months. We definitely owe Dr. Madhavi Reddy for everything that she has done for us and for our little one. HEARTFELT THANKS !!! \n\nFrom being a girl who was scared of hospitals, needles, pain and blood to giving birth via normal delivery, is indeed an achievement for me and it was only because of Dr. Madhavi Reddy's motivation and support. From the first day I met her to till the day I went into labour, she always encouraged me for normal delivery and all because of the trust she gained by her experience I could make up my mind for normal delivery.\n\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Madhavi Govinda Reddy to all the mom and dad to be soon couples. She is the best in Obstetrics & Gynaecology. With her level of experience and knowledge you will definitely be in safe hands. No second thoughts or doubt about it.",

                "review_text": "I am Gritika Jena, a BDL at One Source, Kasturi Nagar,  Bangalore conceived my first child in last week of April 2021.  I was having no knowledge regarding Matrimony Hospitals at Bangalore, since I had moved from Chandigarh to Bangalore in March 2020 after my marriage.  My  in laws who are staying here since last 20 years and they wanted me to choose the best matrimony hospital at Bangalore, having good reputation.  They proposed some names and advised me to check and finalise the Hospital after checking their reviews.\nWe made enquiries from our neighbourhood, who just had recent deliveries and also searched through internet and finally decided to have delivery at Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar.  Also regarding choosing doctor who will take personal care and advise is also a challenge.  After going through the panel of doctors, I decided to choose Doctor Madhavi Reddy to look after my case.  Here I confess that my choice of choosing Doctor Madhavi Reddy was call from my sixth sense and God\u2019s advice which proved to be so rewarding and worthy which I can\u2019t express in words.\nFrom the very first day on 14th June  2022, when I met her and the way she consoled me and treated me as if I am a member of her family.  Being the mother of first child, I was clue less about the whole process of delivery, that too at the time of COVID 2nd phase.  She handled me in such a personal bonding that I never felt that She is my doctor and I am her patient.  I was in a mindset that most of the hospitals used to carry out C Section rather than going for normal delivery.  From very beginning of my interaction with her, she  advised me to carry out normal delivery, but I was not believing her words.  Also my case was a little bit peculiar, as the position of the child was not normal till the last check carried out on 20th  January 2022, but she consoled me not to lose hope of normal delivery.  \nOn final day, that is on 24 January 2022, I reported to the hospital for delivery, though there was no sign of labour pain. But after checking, they admitted me for delivery in the afternoon.  Doctor Madhavi Reddy consoled me of having normal delivery and told me to try for that.  Though, they had lost the hope of normal delivery may be due to abnormal position of my child and the 2nd problem of stoppage of internal secretion of delivery fluid, but they tried their best to have a normal delivery.  A team of five doctors and nurses tried their best and finally at 11pm I delivered my first child a beautiful baby girl child and that too in the process of normal delivery.\nI will never forget Doctor Madhavi Reddy for her invaluable help and guidance in the process of having my first baby and I thank and admire her and the whole team of Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar in helping out me.  Not only Doctor Madhavi Reddy, but the whole other staffs at Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar are very helpful and duty bound.  To mention one more name Mrs. Rama, who was looking after the Insurance claim and billing procedures, helped me a lot. Insurance from my first Insurance Agency completed on 10th January 2022 and my employer changed the Insurance Company and I could manage to get virtual insurance card on 21 Jan 2022, but still she coordinated with the Insurance Company and helped me getting the Insurance amount by the time I was discharged on 26th January 2022.\nI will never hesitate to advise the all potential mothers to choose MOTHERHOOD Hospital, Kalayan Nagar as their destination and Doctor Madhavi Reddy as their personal doctor.\nThanking you.\nGritika Jena\n",

We lives in Saudi when we select the hospital Motherhood near to our home in Bangalore we are in very much confusion to choose the doctor then gone trough to all reviews not even a single review was negative so finally we selected Dr Madhavi Reddy Madam. We first met Madam when I was 26 weeks pregnant . Myself & my husband thought oh she looks so pretty and young She was so calm n composed thru out my delivery. When we met Dr first we told her abt our concern that we are looking for normal delivery & nobody suggested us abt you we have gone trough the review & we selected u madam. She quietly listened to me, that is the best thing about her, she listens to what to say, she is always available for her patient either on phone or what's app, she is also very patience & She is very practical. This worked prefect for me being a first time mother & she knew how to handle me & explain each & everything without any hesitation. Then when i went for 36 weeks scan in that report shows the water level is getting low & she told me today itself get admit will do delivery & I was much worried because my husband is staying Saudi I  was alone with my in laws. Then when my husband contact to madam she explained the situation & he told me that the way madam speaks with me she is very confident that she can try now at least for NVD  & we admitted on same day. After waiting for long 22:00 hrs finally I got labour pains at midnight & U won't believe she is an angel. In the very first visit she told that it will be NVD & she did it, she kept her words. We are proudly parents to say that our baby boy was born from her golden hands on 20th March 2020 at 00.14 am. When I reveal the good news none of our relatives members or friends nor me could believe that its normal delivery because its 3 weeks early born & that too NVD. If other than Dr Madhavi Reddy Madam it would be C section for sure. Am not getting the words how much I can appreciate about the Dr & support staff very much thankful trough out our life.  That's our long story. So I wanted to put all this because many of us looking for NVD. If any young pregnant women looking for a NVD, I strongly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** *** *********** Countless thanks to Dr. Madhavi Reddy Madam for wonderful work & she is a pillar of motherhood. Finally once again thank a lot & all the very best for your future Dr Madhavi Madam & support staff of Motherhood.\n\nBest Wishes,\nShweta & Trinath.\n",

She doesn't create unnecessary fear or have too many restrictions unlike other doctors I have heard of. We wanted a normal delivery and she always encouraged us. She would recommend necessary excercise. Apart from basic exercise, breathing practices and walking she did not recommend anything else. And yes I finally delivered a baby girl normally. I would definitely recommend her if you are a person who want to enjoy your pregnancy journey to the fullest and without any fear. I can't thank her enough for making our pregnancy journey memorable and hassle-free. ",

I consulted Dr. Madhavi Reddy mam from the starting of my pregnancy career and labour. She is highly skilled, very humble, very friendly in nature and she can understand patients situation very clearly and she even responds to patients problem through watsup very thoroughly. Actually i have planned for c section delivery due to the fear of labour pains but mam suggested me to go for normal delivery and also she explained very well about the painless delivery and other types of deliveries. She has more patience and she supports me for normal delivery for one and half day and I delivered a baby girl through vaginal delivery with the support of only Madhavi mam and also mam counselled about the post delivery caring. Because of Madhavi mam, i recovered in 5 days and I am doing my normal works happily. I would highly recommend Dr. Madhavi Reddy mam for my friends and family for their better future. Thank you so much Dr. Madhavi reddy mam for your support and because of you i am so happy with my baby today. Thanks alot mam.",

                "review_text": "It was that day when my husband and I were on cloud nine as I tested positive for pregnancy. It was indeed a joyous moment and it was the time to choose the best Obstetrician to ensure the whole course of nine months of tenure and delivery of our child is in safe hands and then Google suggested us Dr. Madhavi Reddy.\n\nSo we consulted  Dr. Madhavi Reddy and I must say we  instantly knew we made the right decision; she is the best. She is a very good listener, spends lot of time interacting and listening to her patients and gives practical advice, very down to earth person and last but not the least very highly qualified in terms of practical experience. She ensured both mother and baby were doing good whenever we went for routine check-ups.\n\nDays flew by, months passed by, it was October 16th (around 9 PM) I started getting cramp like pain and I knew our baby had started making her way to this beautiful world. I waited till early morning of 17th October and then we messaged Dr. Madhavi Reddy (despite of early morning) and she replied and told us that she will reach out to emergency duty doctor. We reached hospital around 7 AM on 17th October and I was admitted without any hassle. The duty doctor visited us immediately and confirmed that I was already in labor and dilated by 3 cm. We were really excited and at the same time a bit scared. This was that time it seemed the time was in slow motion. Dr. Madhavi Reddy visited us at around 9.30 AM, spoke to us and gave courage as she told us that she will be going ahead with normal delivery (based on her experience and as there were no complications she knew the best). Slowly I started getting pains on and off. Finally when it was the time to push, the real adventure started.\nDr. confirmed that the baby is almost there and it was just the final push which was required from my end. Time was moving slowly and I was not able to push. Dr. Madhavi Reddy motivated me and assured that this was the last push which needs to be made. \nThanks to Almighty and Dr. Madhavi Reddy for the support and motivation, that final push was made and our little darling princess was delivered safely and healthily. It was a memorable and beautiful ride inside the labor room, only because we had Dr. Madhavi Reddy beside us and it was the smoothest without any hurdles or obstacles. \n\nI could bear all the pain and was enjoying this journey only because of the courage Dr. Madhavi Reddy gave me, along with the jokes we were cracking on labour bed.\n\nA big thanks to Dr. Madhavi Reddy for ensuring the safe delivery and taking care of me and our little one throughout the course of nine months. We definitely owe Dr. Madhavi Reddy for everything that she has done for us and for our little one. HEARTFELT THANKS !!! \n\nFrom being a girl who was scared of hospitals, needles, pain and blood to giving birth via normal delivery, is indeed an achievement for me and it was only because of Dr. Madhavi Reddy's motivation and support. From the first day I met her to till the day I went into labour, she always encouraged me for normal delivery and all because of the trust she gained by her experience I could make up my mind for normal delivery.\n\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Madhavi Govinda Reddy to all the mom and dad to be soon couples. She is the best in Obstetrics & Gynaecology. With her level of experience and knowledge you will definitely be in safe hands. No second thoughts or doubt about it.",

                "review_text": "I am Gritika Jena, a BDL at One Source, Kasturi Nagar,  Bangalore conceived my first child in last week of April 2021.  I was having no knowledge regarding Matrimony Hospitals at Bangalore, since I had moved from Chandigarh to Bangalore in March 2020 after my marriage.  My  in laws who are staying here since last 20 years and they wanted me to choose the best matrimony hospital at Bangalore, having good reputation.  They proposed some names and advised me to check and finalise the Hospital after checking their reviews.\nWe made enquiries from our neighbourhood, who just had recent deliveries and also searched through internet and finally decided to have delivery at Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar.  Also regarding choosing doctor who will take personal care and advise is also a challenge.  After going through the panel of doctors, I decided to choose Doctor Madhavi Reddy to look after my case.  Here I confess that my choice of choosing Doctor Madhavi Reddy was call from my sixth sense and God\u2019s advice which proved to be so rewarding and worthy which I can\u2019t express in words.\nFrom the very first day on 14th June  2022, when I met her and the way she consoled me and treated me as if I am a member of her family.  Being the mother of first child, I was clue less about the whole process of delivery, that too at the time of COVID 2nd phase.  She handled me in such a personal bonding that I never felt that She is my doctor and I am her patient.  I was in a mindset that most of the hospitals used to carry out C Section rather than going for normal delivery.  From very beginning of my interaction with her, she  advised me to carry out normal delivery, but I was not believing her words.  Also my case was a little bit peculiar, as the position of the child was not normal till the last check carried out on 20th  January 2022, but she consoled me not to lose hope of normal delivery.  \nOn final day, that is on 24 January 2022, I reported to the hospital for delivery, though there was no sign of labour pain. But after checking, they admitted me for delivery in the afternoon.  Doctor Madhavi Reddy consoled me of having normal delivery and told me to try for that.  Though, they had lost the hope of normal delivery may be due to abnormal position of my child and the 2nd problem of stoppage of internal secretion of delivery fluid, but they tried their best to have a normal delivery.  A team of five doctors and nurses tried their best and finally at 11pm I delivered my first child a beautiful baby girl child and that too in the process of normal delivery.\nI will never forget Doctor Madhavi Reddy for her invaluable help and guidance in the process of having my first baby and I thank and admire her and the whole team of Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar in helping out me.  Not only Doctor Madhavi Reddy, but the whole other staffs at Motherhood, Kalyan Nagar are very helpful and duty bound.  To mention one more name Mrs. Rama, who was looking after the Insurance claim and billing procedures, helped me a lot. Insurance from my first Insurance Agency completed on 10th January 2022 and my employer changed the Insurance Company and I could manage to get virtual insurance card on 21 Jan 2022, but still she coordinated with the Insurance Company and helped me getting the Insurance amount by the time I was discharged on 26th January 2022.\nI will never hesitate to advise the all potential mothers to choose MOTHERHOOD Hospital, Kalayan Nagar as their destination and Doctor Madhavi Reddy as their personal doctor.\nThanking you.\nGritika Jena\n",

We lives in Saudi when we select the hospital Motherhood near to our home in Bangalore we are in very much confusion to choose the doctor then gone trough to all reviews not even a single review was negative so finally we selected Dr Madhavi Reddy Madam. We first met Madam when I was 26 weeks pregnant . Myself & my husband thought oh she looks so pretty and young She was so calm n composed thru out my delivery. When we met Dr first we told her abt our concern that we are looking for normal delivery & nobody suggested us abt you we have gone trough the review & we selected u madam. She quietly listened to me, that is the best thing about her, she listens to what to say, she is always available for her patient either on phone or what's app, she is also very patience & She is very practical. This worked prefect for me being a first time mother & she knew how to handle me & explain each & everything without any hesitation. Then when i went for 36 weeks scan in that report shows the water level is getting low & she told me today itself get admit will do delivery & I was much worried because my husband is staying Saudi I  was alone with my in laws. Then when my husband contact to madam she explained the situation & he told me that the way madam speaks with me she is very confident that she can try now at least for NVD  & we admitted on same day. After waiting for long 22:00 hrs finally I got labour pains at midnight & U won't believe she is an angel. In the very first visit she told that it will be NVD & she did it, she kept her words. We are proudly parents to say that our baby boy was born from her golden hands on 20th March 2020 at 00.14 am. When I reveal the good news none of our relatives members or friends nor me could believe that its normal delivery because its 3 weeks early born & that too NVD. If other than Dr Madhavi Reddy Madam it would be C section for sure. Am not getting the words how much I can appreciate about the Dr & support staff very much thankful trough out our life.  That's our long story. So I wanted to put all this because many of us looking for NVD. If any young pregnant women looking for a NVD, I strongly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** *** *********** Countless thanks to Dr. Madhavi Reddy Madam for wonderful work & she is a pillar of motherhood. Finally once again thank a lot & all the very best for your future Dr Madhavi Madam & support staff of Motherhood.\n\nBest Wishes,\nShweta & Trinath.\n",

She doesn't create unnecessary fear or have too many restrictions unlike other doctors I have heard of. We wanted a normal delivery and she always encouraged us. She would recommend necessary excercise. Apart from basic exercise, breathing practices and walking she did not recommend anything else. And yes I finally delivered a baby girl normally. I would definitely recommend her if you are a person who want to enjoy your pregnancy journey to the fullest and without any fear.

I should say it was the best decision we made!\n\nFor the skeptical person I am, I was wondering why there were only good reviews and none bad. Now I know why I couldn't find any bad review. We always say doctors share the grace of god and indeed I saw it throughout my pregnancy, even in the delivery room.\nAnyone looking for a blissful pregnancy should definitely consult dr Madhavi. A dedicated  professional, you never feel that you are in a docs chamber. She is like a friend and listens to every minute detail and makes sure you leave her chamber in peace and with a clear mind. \n\nShe never prescribed any unnecessary medications or scans. I was diagnosed with  gestational diabetes. She made sure I could control it with diet instead of putting me directly on medication. Though I was ahead in my due date cos of diabetes, she encouraged me for normal delivery.\n\nThe calmness she has reciprocates all around and you instantly feel comfortable. I can say this because I felt it during delivery, I could see myself progress through the highest pain in a womans' life with ease and all this because doctor was by my side reassuring me of the remarkable progess I was making and motivating me to keep calm and stay relaxed through the whole process of normal delivery. \nWe all dread the final day, but mark my words, for a first time mom like me it was a piece of cake all cos dr Madhavi was my consultant. The ease with which she performed the nvd, it showed her prowess. Its all cos of Madhavi mam that I have my son safe in my arms now!\n\nI suggest all expecting moms to definitely consult Dr Madhavi Reddy. Its not always the years of experience that count but the godliness in a person**** ******* *** ** ** **** **** * **** ** ****\n\nI shall conclude by saying - Dr Madhavi Reddy is a highly gifted angel straight from the heavens.",

I thought oh she looks so pretty and young. my first cousin delivered a baby girl thru dr and she suggested me to go n meet dr. She was so calm n composed thru out my delivery. When I met dr first I told her I am very scared of normal delivery n I only prefer c_sec. She quietly listened to me, that is d best thing about her, she listens to what to say, she is always available for her patient either on phone or what's app, she is also very patience. She is very practical no fuss at all. This worked prefect for me being a first time mother n me being a impulsive person she knew how to handle me n explain each n everything without any hesitation. Then d time came for my delivery that is on d 12th October 2019, I came for a regular check up n knew something is gonna happen n my bp went pretty high 150/100. Dr told I will be delivering today since is bp is very high n it might be high risk. U won't believe she is an angel she made sure I only go for normal delivery. My baby girl was born on 13th October at 1.28 am. None of my family members or friends nor me cud believe I opted for normal delivery. If dr did not motivate me or wasnt there is wud have gone for c_sec That's my long story. So I wanted to put all this coz if it was not for dr madhavi Reddy I wud not have been so calm n delivered I am sure I wud have gone for c_sec. If any young pregnant women looking for a dr pls consult dr madhavi Reddy she is going to be a pillar of motherhood very soon, she has so much potential n caliber in her she is no less than any dr. *** ** ****** * ***** ***** * * *** ** **** ******* *** ** *********** *** *** ** *** ***** ",

Mrs X use to come to me for her routine antenatal check ups. 3rd month NT scan showed increased uterine artery Doppler for which she was started on Tab Ecosprin 150mg to prevent fetal growth restriction and pre eclampsia. Routine scans done showed fetal growth restriction. Throughout her visits BP was normal. I want you to show me if there was any documented BP reading which was high when you have visited me. On 11th nov when she met me for routine check up her BP was normal but she had swelling in legs hence urine albumin was done which showed 2+ and advised them to monitor BP daily. On 18th nov they message me at 10:02pm that fetal kicks not felt and advised them to go to Hospital immediately. On arrival BP was very high and hence started injections to bring the BP down. Growth scan showed Doppler changes, and fluctuating BP with imminent signs suggested for delivery to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Since they wanted 2nd opinion we discharged them with a referral letter. 2 days later Surgery was done for the same reason and mother developed complications and was admitted in ICU. This was the complications which I had told them and delivery was asked on the same day. No doctor will give BP tablets for normal BP reading for the predictions of preeclampsia Tab ecosprin was given as per all the text books.",

When I was in doubt of myself to have another successful pregnancy, she was so supportive, analyzed my previous  miscarriages and helped me to know the reason for miscarriages.\n\nI am diagnosed with auto immune disorder, she handled all the obstacles that I faced before and during pregnancy. Be it medicines, lab tests or scans, she suggests right thing at right time. \n\nWe were hoping for a normal delivery and she handled my case very well. After inducing the pain, she did multiple checkups, followups which gave me so much of confidence that am in safe hands. When labor pains were intense, I was afraid if I could have a normal delivery and wanted to go for c-section. She encouraged me so much till the last moment to have normal delivery and finally I had one. If it's not madhavi mam, I would definitely not have a normal delivery on my big day.\n\n\"Less talk, more actions\" is the quote in which I can describe her. *** ** ********** *** **** *************",

During pre-pregnancy, we consulted Dr. Madhavi Reddy by seeing the review and the way she instructed from that day created some special impression compared to other doctors I met earlier. Now I can say that our decision was absolutely right and I would like to recommend others. She is one doctor who doesn't prescribe for more medicine/lab test. My wife's sugar level was in border for which she asked for more walking and checking the report on regular intervals. Also my wife couldn't take iron tablet for which she suggested alternate way. She always guided us for normal delivery at each stage of the pregnancy. Along with this, Doctor explained the different ways of delivery and the benefits through Motherhood's Baby shower ceremony which helped us to know about Epidural. Till the labor room, Baby's head did not come down as expected, but she insisted to go for normal as the success rate is higher by inducing pain as well. Thanks to Dr  Madhavi Reddy the way she handled and the entire team who helped delivering in normal way. Thanks to Motherhood, HRBR management who supported during the delivery and stay period.",

As this is my first pregnancy I was very anxious in the beginning. She patiently answered each and every question and made me very comfortable, to the point that, seeing her made me feel I\u2019ve nothing to worry about in  the labour room.  She even was reachable on WhatsApp for any support. As for the medications, she suggested what is absolutely necessary and nothing more. I only took Iron, calcium and folic acid supplements but nothing more till my delivery.I had a slight complication in the end and worried I\u2019d had to go for c-section. But then she gave enough confidence and pushed me for a normal delivery. I\u2019m so happy I listened to her, I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Thank you so much doctor.",

She guided and took care till the the delivery with the proper instructions. I must say she is the best Doctor i have come across. It was not an easy journey for me as i was into gestational diabetic and high BP. I never thot I can have Normal delivery with these complications. Many women doesn't know that there is an Epidural process which make us less pain. I was almost gave up and want to go for C section but Dr Madhavi Reddy insisted to have a normal delivery with the Epidural process. Also i must that all the process in the Labor ward was very transparently done and nothing was hidden. And Doctor made us to take all the tests and make sure have a healthy Baby. My baby girl was so healthy and i thank  Doctor for making our pregnancy journey a wonderful experience.\n\n",

As we were totally new to the city, we were looking for a friendly doctor who can keep us comfortable through out. Our search ended with Dr. Madhavi Reddy and that was one of the best decisions we had taken in our life. She was truly amazing, calm and supportive. She listened to our concerns on every consultation and gave timely advices. Since our first baby was born with low weight, she took extra care at every scan to make sure the same does not repeat. \nWhen the D day came, it was totally a different scenario from the first one we faced with lot of complexities and we were not prepared for it. Thankfully, Dr. Madhavi and her assistant doctors were prepared and they waited patiently to get the baby out in the most natural way. The labour was prolonged for more than 24 hours, and utmost care was given by each and every doctors and sisters in shifts. We were explained the complexities and options we had at our hand at every step. We had decided to take Epidural and the procedure was done carefully which eased my wife's pain a lot.\nAfter so much struggle, we were blessed with a healthy baby boy and it was an assisted- normal delivery. We will be eternally thankful to Dr. Madhavi for the patience and support she had shown. We highly recommend her!!",

Not only she has taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. One of the most professional doctor I have come across in my life (Yes, I visited 3 to 4 doctors for second pregnancy both offline and online consultations).  \n\nShe understands the problem and had optimistic approach to every problem that gave us a ray hope and feeling of enthusiasm towards life. My pregnancy got confirmed in natural way within 3 months of treatment (diet control advice with basic medicine only)\n\nI am glad to deliver under her. She conducted my delivery as normal painless delivery even though my first delivery was a C-Section and she gave me personal care. Yes I delivered a healthy baby 2.98 kg normally under painless delivery.\n\nShe understands what a woman goes through during pregnancy. She has all the answers of your queries. Treated us like family. If you are looking for a gynaecologist who is very easy, caring, helpful and trustworthy than I highly recommend becoming her patient!!!\n\nThank you so much Ma\u2019am and keep spreading happiness!!!\n",

She has been in practice for a very long time and we took great comfort from that fact. Unfortunately, she was almost 10 kms away from where we stay. In the interest of reducing our travel, she referred us to Dr. Madhavi Reddy. To retrospect, we were a little sceptical to change our Doctor during the last trimester. But we took that leap, knowing this recommendation came from a senior Gynaec. And we are glad we did!This being our first time, Dr. Madhavi Reddy was great in walking us through the process and explaining specifics - which gave us great comfort. We were hopefully for a normal delivery and she was supportive of it from scratch. She was extremely patient and proficient in handling our case. She did multiple checks and follow ups once the pain was induced - whilst calming my wife. We are glad that we were under her supervision. She definitely played a huge role in enriching this experience for us. She brings a great deal of knowledge and experience to the table. For anyone who is looking for a Gynaec, I would highly recommend you consult Dr. Madhavi Reddy!I hope this helps you in making an informed decision.All the best!",

Based on reviews on practo, where most said she strongly encourages normal delivery, I decided to start consulting her at Motherhood HRBR from my 28th week of pregnancy. She s extremely easy going, calm, confident and gutsy doctor. At 29th week, she detected that I had a short cervix and suggested for emergency Cervical Cerclage , thereby avoiding dire consequences like pre term delivery or miscarriage. Having suffered a miscarriage earlier, this was most precious pregnancy. I was able to pull thru til 37 weeks and then due to polyhydramnios and baby weight being higher, pain was induced. Had quite a painful and long labor and in the end almost it was decided to be a C sec. However Dr Madhavi and her team kept motivating me and pushing me hard for normal delivery. Moment she delivered my baby girl with help of forceps, she ran and went to my mom to convey that baby was fine and she immediately was back in OT. She is an expert in handling most tense situations with ease and extreme confidence. I strongly suggest people to consult her and they would never be dissatisfied. She is godsent and we have our baby angel safe and healthy, all thanks to her.",

My due date was 5th of jan, but we decided to go for 1st of jan 2022, so I got admitted on 31st of dec2021 at 2 pm, and she induced pain to me for normal delivery, i suffered almost all the pain till 5.30am, but things didn't turn up may be god has different plan for me... So she suggested for c-sec as the baby was in distress. I was scared for what will happen in c-sec, but it all took hardly 15min and the baby was in my arms, i was blessed with a baby boy. The second day of my operation she asked me to walk around and from that day till today it's been a month now,  I had no pain due to stitches or anything. It was more than smoother.

While we initially planned to deliver in our hometown, we changed the decision and delivered in MotherHood HRBR because we wanted her as our gynecologist.\n\nShe is very patient, answers all questions clearly and doesn't rush through the consultation. Very responsive to queries in person and via Whatsapp.\n****** ******* *********** ********** ** *********** ** **** ** *** ********** *** ******** \n\nI had a low lying placenta till W37, and she provided good clarity on delivery options we had. We were mentally prepared for a C section, but when the placenta moved up suddenly at 38 weeks, she encouraged us to deliver normally without unnecessary medical interventions.\n\nShe had a calming effect on us whenever we got anxious or jittery, which helped tremendously during labour, to a point where we were waiting for her visits during labour and recovery.\n\nDelivery process was very smooth with her guidance and care. Would highly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy!!",

Doctor explains the health issues very clearly in layman's terms. Also We appreciate doctor who encouraged for normal delivery  and with her experience n suggestion we had a normal delivery.\n\nBest of all is that no matter if she had a hectic day during these COVID days at hospital, she will have a smile on her face and make you feel you are the most important person to her; that your problems have a solution that you yourself did not see. She is friendly & approchable and listens to patients' queries and answers clearly. She explains the condition and treatment for better understanding. She clarifies any doubts over calls/messages and encourages online consultation based on the situation, which saves a lot of time.\n\nThank you so so much Dr. Madhavi Reddy for making us feel like our decisions are valid and thank you Motherhood hospital for best in class services and care you provided inspite of COVID situations.",

Those reviews are very genuine and true. She guided me very well since my 5th month pregnancy and my 9 months journey was very good with her. Doctor is available over phone and WhatsApp for any kind of queries and support which helped me so much. I had few issues and My baby\u2019s weight was less even She did not give any kind of unnecessary medicines through out my pregnancy. Just doctor asked me to take proper food intake. I followed all her instructions. \nFinally I am very much happy and satisfied with my delivery. I did not get natural pains and I am induced for labour. After getting admitted labour room staff supported me well and gave me courage. My normal delivery would not have been possible without doctor and staff support.\n\nAs Madhavi doctor said normal delivery can be done, it has been done with all staff support and doctor support. I could able to recover within 2 days. I am so happy.\nI will definitely recommend Motherhood hospital and Madhavi doctor due to its transparency and the way normal delivery Is handled with much supporting and caring staff. \nI am very thankful to Madhavi mam. I will definitely consult you even for my second pregnancy.\ud83d\ude0a",

She was friendly, approachable and I felt like I was in safe hands. My pregnancy had risks. Initially my scan revealed a hemorrhage. Dr Reddy immediately put me on bed rest. As my pregnancy continued, my scans revealed that I had a short cervix which means there was a very high chance of a pre-term birth. Needless to say, I was really worried. Dr Reddy gently explained the risks to me,, opted to perform the cervical cerlage and put me on complete bedrest until the end of pregnancy. Throughout my 9 months, whenever I needed her, she was always available on her phone. I texted her for smallest of things but she was attentive to my needs.\nFinally when I entered the 36th week, she removed by stitch and advised me to get induced and deliver. My delivery was smooth. Nurses and doctors made me feel very comfortable. Dr Reddy helped me deliver my son safely and I can't thank her enough. She is highly recommended.",

She promised me that she will help me to deliver a healthy baby without complications this time and I blindly followed all her instructions and suggestions and delivered a healthy boy baby on 27 May 2020. The best quality in her is her patience and practical thinking. People dont believe she always responds to patients either in call or WhatsApp. I personally contacted her many times even at 11 pm she responded me. Such a dedicated doctor i never seen till now. Next time also we will go to Dr Madhavi Reddy. I strongly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy for safe and healthy delivery and she's expert in handling minor and major complications during pregnancy and doing normal deliveries except in very very very least cases considering the health of mother and baby. Overall its a very good experience with Dr Madhavi Reddy during my whole pregnancy and finally she's the one who helped me to become a healthy mom to a healthy and cute baby. ",

But with the help of gynecologist, Madhavi Reddy we came to know they are mumps. She advised going for abortion as it may affect child growth. We did the same. \nWhen we visited the gynecologist for the second round of abortion pills. I was bleeding heavily and was very fatigued. I told her the same. She notified that it is normal as part of this process. When asked about the amount of bleeding and uterus pain, she just told us the bleeding will happen and there will be uterus pain for 1-2 weeks. \nI feel that a doctor should guide the patient thoroughly on the overall process and anything which should be a concern in the process **** ******** ****** ** *********\nIn the whole process, I lost a lot of blood. When we called customer care Motherhood, she did not even bother to have a talk with us and asked to get an appointment. \nEventually, my hemoglobin went down to 4.5, pulse was 142. I got in a very critical condition and was brought to ******* hospital in an emergency, transfused 4 bottles of blood, underwent suction d&e procedure. I was admitted there for 4 days.\nNever, will I ever refer any of my friends/family to this hospital and especially to Madhavi Reddy.",

Only necessary scans and blood tests were performed during the pregnancy period.\n\nDuring the delivery of the baby, she was there through out and took care of each and every concern of us and helped in going through the pain. She made sure I was comfortable at every stage and considered our opinion and explained and shared her suggestions.\n\nI can never thank her enough for the care and concern she showed for the last 9 months, she literally took care of me like a mother would.

It is really rare to see any doctor waiting for such a long duration for patient  for a normal delivery. I am sure if I would had visited any other doctor, definitely they it wont be a normal delivery.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy to other patients.

She is very friendly and always greets us with a smile. She listens to all our concerns very patiently and suggests proper course of action. \nShe is highly skilled, very knowledgeable and highly respected among her peers and colleagues in Motherhood Hospital. \nThe best part was her friendly and understanding nature. Throughout the 9 months of my wife's pregnancy, we never felt like we were visiting a hospital. It was more of a friendly visit which also happens to be a check up. The thing that we liked very much was that, in our case, she did not scare us even once. Even when some of the scan results were out of the normal range, she motivated us and suggested what needed to be done and we were able to see the improvement in results immediately. \n\nFrom all the check ups to scans to coming early in the morning to be there for her delivery, she was a source of strength to us. Even after the delivery, she let my wife be herself without imposing too many restrictions and took really good care of her. \n\nIn short, we had a wonderful experience with Dr Madhavi Reddy and my wife Dhivya and I highly recommend the Doctor. \n\nP.S: She is never late in coming to the hospital. There has never been even one single instance where we had to wait because the Doctor did not come on time. \n\nThanks, \nDhivya and Karthick",

Dr was so helpful and informative and was able to answer any questions we had & even over the phone at emergencies.I would like to thank you so much Dr Madhavi Reddy from the bottom of our hearts for taking such good care of us during the pregnancy as well as the delivery!! Because of your professionalism and always great smiles, we felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Thank you for helping deliver the most precious gift of our life!!\u201dAt initial stage of pregnancy we have asked whether normal delivery is possible rather than cesarean & Dr promised normal delivery happen only if we follow every instruction of her. We had followed every instruction & finally it was normal delivery.When my wife was at labour, I didn't had hopes of normal delivery looking at her situation & asked Dr it's taking too long so can we look alternative. Dr Madhavi Reddy just smiled at me & told let her as well me to rest for 1 hr so that everything will be alright. Within 40 min i was asked to be at labour ward & Dr told me she ready delivery. Within next 40 mins baby was delivered. Both mother & baby was healthy. Mother was back to normal within few hours. I would like to thank you Dr Madhavi Reddy for all your guidance & support.Also need to Thank Rama mam, Dr Sireesha (scanning) all the staff from scanning team, Anesthesia Surgeon, Nursing Staff, House keeping staff, Admin Team, Security Guards & all non medical staff of hospital for supporting us.I have heard from many staff at hospital that Dr Madhavi Reddy always push for normal than ceserean & her maximum patients had normal deliveries.I strongly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy consultation at Motherhood Hospital HRBR Layout Bengaluru.",

We were given few options,we choose Madhavi Reddy among them,that was the best decision ever made.It is always a stress in mind when such things happen, but just by first visit we were convinced she is the right doctor for us. \n\nShe is very patient,calm and friendly. She gave her contact number in case of emergency (which I had not got from my previous doctor). In 3 days after visiting her,I got my labor pain and I contacted her through Watsapp n call , she responded even at night 11.30. After visiting the hospital my contractions were not strong enough.She suggested to go back home n come back when pain frequency increases or water breaks or I can't tolerate pain. \n\nNext day my pain increased, I got admitted at afternoon. She visited me immediately. I had 2 fibroids and amiontic fluid levels were quite high. Other doctors I consulted had told, with fibroids it would be difficult for normal delivery. She never scared me or told such things. \n\nFor next 10 hours she kept on visiting every one hour or two. Sometimes she was asking the duty doctors to send a video of the NST. This was when my baby's heartbeat started showing low after giving oxytocin.At this stage other doctors would have gone for c - section. But she stopped oxytocin and gave me oxygen mask n tried if that showed any improvement. Yes it did. \n\nEven after that my cervix was not diluted enough and the baby was still in -3 position. It would have needed another 8 hours of labour. She was ready to wait for such a long duration. Luckily when she came at 10pm , cervix was diluted enough and baby was in the right position for delivery. Within half n hour the baby was delivered normally.\n\nShe tries 100% for normal delivery. I strongly recommend her.she is very friendly and open to all our doubts.\n\nGod bless you and your family.\n\n",

Initially I was little nervous and worried in case if anything goes wrong during the nine months pregnancy journey. But with the doctor constant guidance and support, it all became easy and possible. I was amazed to see the hand holding done by the doctor and entire hospital staff to make sure both baby and mother are given the best possible treatment. I would like to specifically highlight the point when my wife blood platelets dropped abruptly during the last month and then doctor took the full responsibility of arranging platelets in almost no time and with the great services provided by the hospital it was all done without any hazzle. My wife delivered normally with no issues at all. This is the maximum anyone can expect from a doctor and a hospital. I would strongly recommend Dr Madhavi Reddy in Motherhood Hospital for a memorable start of the parenthood experience.",

Subsequently she was at the hospital early in the morning for the delivery procedure. \n\nWe are ever indebted to Dr Reddy and hope that many others benefit from her expertise and skills. \n\nThank You Dr Madhavi Reddy for all that you did for us.

She explains everything very neatly and also gives us enough time to talk and discuss our issues. She will not suggest any unnecessary medicine or tests . My pregnancy was lil tough in last trimester because of BP and gestational diabetics, but she gave me the confidence that everything will be alright and ensured smooth delivery.\n\nEven after delivery she monitored everything like diet , my wellbeing etc very keenly. Right from the pregnancy to delivery/post delivery she supported a lot in all the things.",

I had expressed my wish for NVD without epidural and Dr.Madhavi was practical in explaining that it depends on so many factors as well as my endurance. When I visited her for my 38 week checkup, she predicted that I may be in labour soon and no wonder my water broke the same day as soon as I reached home. Am happy with her accuracy in the examination. Also while in labour, she listened patiently about my fear/pain during PE, and handled it gently. The alertness and compassion expressed by the nurses and doctors in the labour ward helped me endure the pain with patience. I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Madhavi Reddy and team for helping me delivery my baby safely.",

I wanted a C section but she helped me gain confidence for normal delivery. though during my labour the baby pooped in the stomach so we had to go for emergency c section during which my fibroids were also removed as it was critical. She is great under stressful situations and i knew I was in good hands always. ",

After my first visit to the doctor, I knew I didn't have to worry about anything. Not only was she open and communicative, I could also reach her anytime without any hesitation. She patiently answered all my questions. Dr. Madhavi gave it her all in ensuring that I had a normal delivery. I went ahead with a CS but even then I had nothing to worry about. Choosing her was a fantastic decision, one that I'm really glad about. \ud83d\ude0a ",

Though I had some mild complications in the initial stage doctor was very kind and treated me with basic medicines and did not overload me with too many medicines. She is very simple and answers to the point explains every doubt without any hesitation. Though I had to go for emergency C section because of two cords around my baby\u2019s neck, Dr Madhavi was very quick in taking a decision to deliver my baby because the baby\u2019s heart rate was reducing.\nEven after my surgery Dr Madhavi visited me several times and the best part is she personally held my hands and took me for a walk and encouraged me to walk So that I recover well. Overall my experience with Dr Madhavi Reddy was very nice and pleasant. I will definitely continue to refer Dr Madhavi to my friends and relatives. Thank you Dr.",

Would usually respond to messages as per convenience and also helped me in taking due physical care during my journey with proper food habits and physical care. My stay in the Labor Room was a little scary but when she came down at 6AM to see me, i was consoled and ultimately got my baby delivered at 11:21AM.. \\nWords would really fall short to describe Mrs Reddy but me and our family are really satisfied with Doctor Madhavi.",

After reading a lot of positive reviews about Dr. Madhavi Reddy, we decided to consult her and after meeting her a couple of times; we were absolutely sure to go ahead with her.  The Doctor use to listen and advise very peacefully on our visits. She never panics or scare you about a situation that you might experience during your 9 months journey.  The best part of Dr. Madhavi Reddy is she will try her very best for a normal delivery till the very end and i am really glad i was able to go through a normal delivery and complete credit goes to the doctor and her team for the upmost patience they showed towards me. I would like to thank Dr. Madhavi Reddy for all the support and would highly recommend her to others. \n",

I was also admitted in the hospital during my 5th month because of seizures, but doctor treated me very well during that time and suggested me to just eat well, take rest and do some excercise and walking . Doctor responds to our calls and messages. Doctor encourages and suggests to go for NVD and with doctors support and guidance I delivered a baby boy through normal delivery. I would like to thank Dr. Madhavi mam, duty doctor and all the staff at labour room. I highly recommend Dr.Madhavi Reddy mam to all. \nThank u so much mam.",

The situation was to do an immediate surgery on the next day to keep the baby safe. Had it been 36 weeks, both the doctor and I would be happy to go for the surgery.  I was worried about the lungs growth of the baby, but I had to accept as there was no choice for either of us.\nIt was Dr. Madhavi Reddy who gave full hope and confidence to me; took my case as a challenge, persuaded me to take NST daily. I was kept under full observation for 2 weeks. I followed as the doctor advised and I delivered a baby boy successfully on the 3rd day of 37th week. \nA mere thanks to the doctor will never suffice for her sincere effort. This review could be my minimum act to express my gratitude to her.\n \n",

I was consulting with another doctor until I was tested positive for corona just at the beginning of 8th month and didnt receive any support from her. I tried changing doctors but most of them were not willing to take my case. It was only Dr. Madhavi who readily took up my case and assured me that it will all be fine. I was firm on having a normal delivery but with the gradual weight loss due to corona and low AFL, I was losing my confidence. But Dr. Madhavi guided me very well and in 2 months I gave birth to a healthy baby boy through NVD. No unnecessary scans, tests or medication. Just what was needed. She also explained how exercising and walking daily will help the entire process. I highly recommend Dr. Madhavi. She is calm and answers any questions you have at any time, even at odd hours. Thank you Dr. Madhavi for the beautiful time I had consulting with you.",

She advised for Normal Vaginal Delivery with basic exercises from the beginning as I didn\u2019t want to go through a painful C section.  She is always helpful to respond to your queries through WhatsApp and even during consultation at the hospital. \nBeing a mother is the greatest gift I\u2019ve received despite all the pains a woman goes through during labor. \n\nThank you once again Dr.Madhavi Reddy mam.",

She will inform you all the pros and cons at every step of your pregnancy.  If you are looking for normal delivery please do visit her. For me I opted for c section.  she recommended me for normal but after 3 days of labor I didn't have patience that day and decided for c section. After recovery from surgery pain was also good , she was very good with surgery too, took only 10min in operation room. After delivery my diabetes also under control.  I became a happy mommy on mother's day. Do visit her and all the best for your upcoming motherhood journey.  :)",

The best part is her friendly and understanding nature. She is approachable and answers all the queries patiently and is very supportive.

Was anytime available over the phone for any issues or concerns faced. She understands the case properly and prescribes necessary medications. Never faced common pregnancy problems like thyroid or diabetes or blood pressure coz of her constant review and prescribing prior medicines understanding our family health history. Very kind and compassionate towards patients. Would like to recommend her for all others whom I know. Delivered a baby safely through her support and help. Thank you so much!",

She was always available throughout the pregnancy period. Whether it was a Sunday or a holiday, we could message her anytime and get help. She was very cautious with me as my pregnancy was high risk. She attended to me and took care of all details. I had an emergency c-section and doctor helped me very well. She is friendly, very approachable and warm. I would recommend her to anyone needing pregnancy help.",

I have consulted Madhavi mam from starting of my delivery.I would be just follow her suggestions and you will journey will be so smooth .She will mosty try for Normal delivery in all the possible ways . In my case i had gain more weight during my 5 th month of pregnancy,she asked me to be cautious on my weight gain and provided instructions,trust me I just followed her and had very little pregnancy weight gain .Also with her suggestions I was able to overcome gestational diabetes without any medicines controlled everything through diet. During delivery mam and junior doctors gave me very good support and with that support I was able to make it for normal delivery.She was so down to earth and clarifies all our silly doubts too and available in WhatsApp for any of our questions.One more reason why we choose her is she speaks telugu.I would like to rate 5 start for her treatment and whoever Willing to have normal delivery blindly follow her she will make your wish possible with very nice treatment.",

She was humble and educated me with oy required information. I never had a doubt or curiosity to find out more about mine or baby's health.Which was not needed when Dr. is herself was confident about all things. The biggest miracle that happed, i was in my 36th week 1st day and came for a regular checkup. my scans looked fine but baby weight was on higher side for 36th week. Dr. checked baby's dialation and was in shock it was already 4cm away with no pain and ready to be delivered. I was immediately admitted and delivered my baby in next 3hours. my complication of over weight baby could ve led to C-section. but with all Dr. help and unexpected early delivery mine was normal delivery. With all the miracles and support baby was delivered healthy and i was doing fine with very less delivery pain. ",

She didn't prescribe too many medicines and tried more for Normal delivery till the last minute and i got  positive vibes always after every consultation in my preganancy.  A big thanks to her to make the ride a smooth and efficient one, we had an emergency cesarean due to absent of fetal movements in last week. I am so glad we got to consult her without someone recommending to visit her, everything went good.Overall its a very good experience so I strongly recommend her for any consultations. May GOD give her more strength so that she can look after more number of patients and  even in future I am planning to consult her for my second pregnancy.

She highly recommended home remedies rather taking medication (I had severe cough during 7th month) during course of pregnancy to avoid any risk to the baby. She explain everything in detail with lots of patience. During mid of 7th month of my pregnancy I had placental bleeding so Dr. Madhavi Reddy explained the complications that can happen and treated for the same which postponed the labour for sometime. But due to continued bleeding Dr. Madhavi Reddy advised to admit for observation during which the Dr. and hospital team monitored well and observed need for emergency delivery at 30 weeks since placental bleeding sustained which can lead to major complications to the baby and mother. So Dr. Madhavi Reddy explained the complications and advised immediate delivery. Delivery went very well. Now my baby (premature) and myself doing good. She tried for normal Delivery but due to heavy bleeding C-section was performed immediately. \nThank you Dr. Madhavi Reddy for your excellence. ",

Doctor is very friendly,  always  greet  with smile . She listen to our all  concern very patiently and suggest  proper course of action. She will give preference  to normal delivery.  If anyone looking  for normal delivery  means,  don't think anything just consult  Madhavi  Reddy  doctor.  She is very helpful , very calm. She is always available  on phone  and whatsapp. when I met her for first time in 9 months , I felt  very comfortable and I'm at right place with right doctor. On the day of delivery , I went through  long hours of pain,and scared about normal delivery,  I was not able bear  the pain, this doctor motivated me and I had normal delivery . I'm sure if I had visited any other doctor definetly they would not be normal delivery.  She will wait for such long  time and she will try  for normal delivery  only.  I strongly  recommend this doctor only.  U will never see such nice doctor  after you meet. Thank you Doctor  for your help.  ",

Then when pregnant, she used to handle all our queries and inspire confidence in us. Now that our little one is over 6 months old, we feel so blessed to have met her. I would highly recommend her for any gynaec related consulting.",

The journey started at last year August and we had no clarity on meternity and with full of doubts . Intial months consultaions were very short and I felt like doctor is a kind of introvert but later on I have realised that she is very much experienced in  giving just valuable info instead of telling non sense to create unneccesary  fear. I am the one have not seen anyone's maternity in my home or near by and we were handling the things with out parents support . I sincerely Thank Madhavi Mam's co operation and guidance to compelete the journey without a single Hurlde . Maternity Journey went like Meditaion with her guidence .Being an anxiety patient I have not gone though any panic situations in our 9 months journey with the doctor .  Finally I strongly Recommend Her Name for any Gynic related issues. ",

I had visited her during my third month of pregnancy and she was extremely helpful and guided me well. Very polite and forbearing, she would invariably give you a patient hearing and then advise.Due to certain unexpected circumstances, I had to undergo an emergency c-section which was very well undertaken by her and team. I delivered a healthy baby girl, thanks to Dr. Madhavi. ",

Withing 1st consultation she suggested me for PCOD scan. I doubted her diagnosis as my cycles were regular. But still, I followed her suggestion and the same day did ultrasound scanning. Yes, it was both sides nice polycystic ovaries. She gave the advice to follow proper exercise and diet with 250mg of Metformin to regulate my hormones for two months and to try naturally. In the third month, she suggested me for a follicular scan. When the follicular size was good she gave me a trigger dose (IM) so that ovulation happens. Next month I thanked her with the Happy News. Now, I am eight-month pregnant. My ANC checkups with her are very smooth. Every month every step and report she explains me very well. She is not only experienced in her field but also as a person very humble and approachable. Thank you Dr Madhavi for this lovely blessing. ",

Regarding my journey of 9 months with her it was so soothing experience she was very calm in treating everytime as I had AFI more than normal she just explained the situation and asked to follow the diet, I just followed her words nothing complications happened. She is one among the only few doctors who never unnecessarily go for c section, I'm the best example for this. As I had  first delivery normal she tried her best for second also to be normal and I had second also normal. Never seen such a doctor with such calmness handling, been blessed to have her. I strongly recommend Madhavi reddy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd1d",

She didn't prescribe too many medicines and always listened carefully to each and every query in all our visits.\nDr. Madhavi Reddy is very humble and caring person. She has lots of patience and has good patience-centric skills. \nNow coming to labour and delivery, Dr. Madhavi Reddy tried her best for normal delivery and was successful. \nWe are very much thankful to Dr. Madhavi Reddy for everything. May GOD give her more strength so that she can take care of more number of patients. ",

Once we met her, we found her very genuine and calm in her approach. Her first line that impressed us that pregnancy is not a disease so we don't consider you as a patient. I had so many doubts and concerns as this was my first pregnancy. She never pressurised us for any unnecessary costly medicines, tests, or treatment.  She was always there to contact easily for us. I delivered my son under her consultation 4 days back in an emergency condition and got admitted at 12 am. Her approach was too friendly and supportive at that time. I am extremely happy to consult her and was in her guidance during my full term and thankful to her \ud83e\udd17",

I had a good experience at Motherhood hospital; I'm happy with Dr Madhavi's willingness to attend to her patients sincerely. \nI had changed 3 gynaecologists before settling with her, I was looking for a gynaec who is friendly and professional at the same time doctor and im glad I found one.\nI felt comfortable with the way she does her best to understand the issue and treat it, as a first time pregnant woman, I had genuine concerns which she didn't mind clarifying not only in person but also on calls and messages.\nShe guided me through fit pregnancy(advised about right workouts and cautions to be taken) which I followed and helped me later in fast recovery after delivery too.\nLastly, I would like to add that I now have a healthy, lovely baby girl Alhamdulillah.\nI would recommend the doctor.
