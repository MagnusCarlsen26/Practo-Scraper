The thorough explanations and willingness to address all my concerns eased any anxieties I had. I cannot thank enough for the professionalism and kindness Dr Ramya showed throughout the entire process.\n\nMoreover, Your availability to answer questions and provide guidance has been invaluable as I navigate this new chapter of motherhood.\n\nI feel truly fortunate to have had Dr Ramya as my gynecologist and obstetrician. Her commitment to her profession and patients is evident, and I will always remember the positive experience I had under her care.\n\nOnce again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything she has done for me and my family. I look forward to continuing to entrust my healthcare needs to her in the future.",

Dr. Ramya's expertise and compassionate approach were evident from the start. She meticulously assessed my condition, provided clear explanations, and devised a comprehensive care plan tailored to my specific needs. Throughout the journey, she demonstrated exceptional professionalism, offering reassurance and support during each visit. Thanks to Dr. Ramya's dedication and skill, I felt confident and well-cared-for during this challenging time. I am immensely grateful for her invaluable contribution to my pregnancy journey",

Her expertise, patience, and reassuring demeanor made all the difference during such a critical time.\n\nFrom our very first appointment, I knew I was in capable hands. The thorough explanations and willingness to address all my concerns eased any anxieties I had. I cannot thank enough for the professionalism and kindness Dr Ramya showed throughout the entire process.\n\nMoreover, Your availability to answer questions and provide guidance has been invaluable as I navigate this new chapter of motherhood.\n\nI feel truly fortunate to have had Dr Ramya as my gynecologist and obstetrician. Her commitment to her profession and patients is evident, and I will always remember the positive experience I had under her care.\n\nOnce again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything she has done for me and my family. I look forward to continuing to entrust my healthcare needs to her in the future.",

Dr. Ramya's expertise and compassionate approach were evident from the start. She meticulously assessed my condition, provided clear explanations, and devised a comprehensive care plan tailored to my specific needs. Throughout the journey, she demonstrated exceptional professionalism, offering reassurance and support during each visit. Thanks to Dr. Ramya's dedication and skill, I felt confident and well-cared-for during this challenging time. I am immensely grateful for her invaluable contribution to my pregnancy journey",

I consulted her from the very first day of my pregnancy and delivered a healthy baby boy in October. It was only because of her constant guidance and motivation that encouraged me for a normal delivery. Apart from being the best in her field, she is the most humble person Ive come across. Ma\u2019am was so patient with all our queries as first time parents and has guided me post delivery as well due to which my recovery has been extremely smooth. I highly recommend Dr Ramya K S to all who want to make the best of their pregnancy journey, you\u2019d be in the safest hands possible .\nThankyou ma\u2019am for giving us the most precious gift :)",

I was suffering from vomiting, fever, and  extreme body pain. same day i got to know that I am pregnant. then I was contact with gynecologist dr. Ramya she is very nice and excellent doctor. I told all the symptoms then doctor prescribed me some medicine and some folic acid tablet for baby. doctors told me that not to take  any medicine by yourself without consulting any doctor in pregnancy days. and i followed her. and i feel better after 2 days.. ya overall experience is good. I must say in these app doctors are good. and you can take advice or consultation over call if you are not unable to reached hospital at that time. thanks. ",
