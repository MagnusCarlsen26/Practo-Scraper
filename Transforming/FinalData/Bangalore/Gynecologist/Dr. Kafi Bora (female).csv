,,0,0,NO,I visited the doctor to get my Anomaly scan done. The doctor was very rude and literally shouting asking me to get my hands off my tummy and that it was her area. She could have conveyed the same in a normal tone. Also during the scan I had to inform her that she is taking the screenshots of my report under the previous patientâ€™s name and not under my name. **** ** *** ************ ** **** ******. *** ****** *** ***** ***** ** *** ** ****** **** * *******. We are paying for her time and she is responsible to behave accordingly. I did not pay her to get scolded by her. ******* *** ******* ********** ** **** ** ****** ***** **** **** ** ** *********. Would never recommend her to anyone. ,2023-11-01 20:35:24,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
