I m undergone fertility treatment about 5 years since 2019 in many hospitals, and also my first IVF treatment was unsuccessful in different hospital. My friend suggest to visit Genea. \nWhen I visit Genea, Doctor Divyashree gave hope that I will conceive  soon even though my AMH is very low and there was male factor. I was undergone 2nd IVF at Genea. Within 2 months of the treatment the result just brought tears in our eyes. Yes, it's a positive pregnancy. Very friendly staff and Doctor too. I strongly suggest that this is the best place to solve your problem if you also suffering from fertility issue. Thankyou Dr Divyashree and hospital staff",

                "review_text": "My emotional journey towards Motherhood!!Hope is the only thing stronger than Fear\"Never give up on dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it\"Our journey of trying to conceive started in 2009 (after 3 years of Marriage). Failed to conceive naturally without any luck.  I was diagnosed with fibroids and underwent a Laparoscopic surgery in 2010 to remove it and correct the adhesions. After that, we tried to conceive naturally again with no success. We had to shift to different clinic nearby home by end of 2010 to avoid too much of travelling. As per Dr\u2019s suggestion went through 3 cycles of IUI before going for IVF in 2012. First Embryo transfer failed, eventually 2nd Embryo Transfer was positive, however the happiness was short lived, because I miscarried at 8 weeks and the doctor said it was due to UTI. We were devasted at this point, had lost hope...our energy, patience, mental & physical stability...everything was drained. The Doctor also did not give us any hope. We started focusing on our career, betterment of personal life.Restarted the journey in 2019. Upon our own research consulted Dr. Divyashree at Milann Hospital.  We could feel the positive vibe and encouragement in our first meet itself.  I had to undergo another laparoscopic surgery due to severe stage 4 Endometriosis and Adenomyosis before 2nd IVF attempt, unfortunately IVF cycle was unsuccessful.  We moved to Genea Clinic when Dr. Divyashree started of her own to begin our 2 half of the journey.At Genea we tried 4 IVF non-stop cycles including the pandemic period in a span of 4 years (5 failed Embryo Transfers, 2 cancelled Embryo transfer due to embryo not turning into Blastocyst and 1 Embryo transfer turned into twin conception).  After failure of 3 cycles & the required surgeries/procedures, we weren\u2019t in a good position to continue & lost hope and financially drained.  After few days we were called upon to meet Dr. Divyashree and the Dr. persuaded us to try one last time, for which we are grateful for her generosity and her level of personal attention towards us.We didn\u2019t want to disappoint her and went ahead with the suggested plan and ET was done with 2 embryos with no expectations whatsoever.  To our surprise, miracle happened with twin conception on 14th Jun 2023.  We & everyone at Genea were equally happy and celebrating our success.  Dr. Divyashree was triumphant & very happy, emotional at the same time.  We are so lucky that Genea family was with us in every step, situation. Dr. Divyashree & Dr. Chaithra took very good care of me because of the complication and suggested we have frequent scans to closely monitor. \u2003At 9th week scan we got to know that one of the twin heartbeat had stopped and the other was healthy, hence I was closely monitored from then.  Unfortunately, the 2nd baby's growth was restricted at 18 weeks due to placental problem and preeclampsia.  Dr. Divyashree and Dr. Chaithra suggested to do a blood test to see the level of risk I was in before continuing and the risk was reported as too high to continue and my BP was shooting up despite of medication. With heavy heart Dr. Chaithra suggested we have to terminate the pregnancy before I get into severe risk. We terminated the pregnancy on Oct 13th and lost our baby girl.  This emotional & painful journey of 14 years (with 3 major laparoscopic surgeries, 3 minor procedures, 3 IUIs, & 6 IVF cycles) ended at Motherhood Hospital!Even though we could not take our bundle of joy home, we are writing this to urge other couples who are trying to conceive, that always have patience. Infertility treatment and IVF is not an easy journey as you all know...but with patience, hope, healthy eating habits, yoga, meditation, you can make it an easy process.  When we saw frequent failures, we made up our mind and was always prepared for any outcome. That\u2019s when the pain of failure did not affect us too much every single time and we were ready for the next round in no time.  We have no guilt or regrets as we always felt that we went to the right Doctor. I have seen many patients who have conceived naturally, first time in IUI, first cycle of ivf.  Dr. Divyashree is an expert who diagnoses your issues and suggests the right kind of treatment. I have gone to different hospitals, different doctors, but never met anyone like her. Kind and compassionate, professional and always eager to help all the patients. I definitely did not feel like she was my doctor. She was always like a close friend taking care of us in every step and always gave us hope. She explained all the procedures, technicalities even before we had a doubt. Dr. Chaithra was also very helpful and supportive throughout my pregnancy and especially during the termination process. She herself followed up every few hours due to my condition.My husband and myself could go through this long and tough journey and would like to recommend these learnings to all the couples going through this journey:1. Have Patience... It is the key to success2. Never lose Hope3. Have Faith and trust in yourself (very important), in your doctors. Especially Doctor like Dr. Divyashree and her team, they will always guide to the right path4. Don\u2019t Stress too much... Practice yoga, meditation, have healthy eating habits (which will help to improve your health and chances)5. DO NOT delay your treatment6. Trust yourself and the processWe would whole heartedly thank Dr. Divyashree, Dr. Chaithra, Dr. Rashmi, Mr. Hemanth, Mr. Nandish & all the staffs of Genea (to name a few: Bhagya, Preethi, Ashwini, Arjun, Gowdru, Sindhu, Vishalu, Bhanu, Suma, Asha etc\u2026.) who are very kind and helpful, we will always recommend them to other patients.Wishing Genea team all the success in fulfilling every couple's dream of becoming parents!",

But we had a faith on our doctor and moved in the path laid by her... She never and ever made us discouraged and was very positive in our case... One good thing observed is Dr Divya sree never handed over any case to any of her staff.. She personally takes care of each and every case.. \n\nWith all the prayers and blessings of family, well wishers and specially fertility centre staff I have succeeded in 2nd cycle.. \n\nI sincerely thank Dr Divya sree, Dr Jhansi, Dr Chaitra,Dr Poonam for making me comfortable throughout the journey in Genea Fertility... Despite of having loosing hopes in each every stage of my life they have made my Dream come true. \n\nSpecial mention about the staff (Asha,Namratha,Naveena and Dhanu) who are exceptionally freindly, co-operative and kind. Never ever felt that they are just a staff over there.

But because for various reasons, she was unavailable and we had to start consulting with another Doctor. \nAs fate would have it, after going back to Dr Divyasree for consultation again, we are now blessed with a baby girl. \nAfter having consulted in a MultiChain IVF center, initial visits to Genea were a totally different experience and we were starting to have doubts. But all those doubts were put to rest later. \nTo all future parents, Genea is driven by team of passionate \"All Rounders\" headed by Dr Divyasree herself. Given the multiple roles each of the Team members handles, it will take some waiting, but it's worth it. \n\nSo After 7 years of trying with failed attempts of IVF earlier due to various reasons [ Covid, Still growth] we had almost lost all hope when we went to Dr.Divyasree. She took up our case as a challenge and challenged her team as well to have this case a Success. \nWhen Dr.Divyasree said that it's her gut feeling that all the parameters are looking good and we shall try IVF again, we ourselves didn't have any hope left, but we blindly trusted her and went ahead which gifted us parenthood today. \nDr.Divyasree has immense memory, despite seeing so many patients, she remembers the details of each of the patient and keeps following up on them.\nDr.Divyasree , Dr.Rashmi, Dr. Nandini Patil, and Dr.Chaitra with smiles on their face, were always making us feel positive and provided great support. To put it in a word they were \"BINDAAS\". The conversations used to be Friendly than like a typical \"Dr and Patient\" \nAll the doctors were available whenever we required their help and moreover they were very transparent in explaining all the details/risks.  \nDr. Rashmi and Dr. Chaitra - with their expertise helped us to overcome a few complexities.  \n\nAshwini, Sindhu, Arjun, Preeti, Bhanu, Suma, Asha, and all the other staff at Genea are amazingly friendly, they made us feel comfortable. This is what sets them apart from the Multichain Clinics. The personal touch. \n\nThank You Team Genea.\n\nTo All aspiring parents, No treatment is 100% Success. It needs lots of Patience and Perseverance. Dont lose hope and Trust the Doctors. \nAt Genea, they have not prescribed any unwanted tests or scans nor they have charged exorbitantly. Infact it's more economical than most others. Highly recommend Genea.  ",

I had conceived in 2016 but unfortunately it was an ectopic pregnancy and I partially lost my right fallopian tube during the surgery. After that my struggle to conceive began! We tried to conceive again but it didn't happen. Our doctor then put me on medication to ovulate but most of my cycles got cancelled as I mostly ovulated from the right. After numerous cycles got cancelled, our doctor suggested us to go for IUI with injections. After bearing the pain of injections for two cycles, we still didn't get positive result. It was a stressful period for us as we had already lost two years trying. Our doctor then suggested us to go for IVF. We then approached Dr.Divyashree Ma'am of Milann and went to meet her (May 2018) to discuss our case for IVF. She was very clear and explained us the next course of action to be taken. She suggested us to undergo few tests and to try for two cycles of IUI. The IUI cycles didn't result in positive and then we decided to move to IVF. The next three cycles we couldn't start with the IVF process as my hormones weren't on the expected range. Finally on December 2018, my IVF cycle started but as I had overstimulated, the embryos were frozen. In January, we went for FET and transferred two 8 cell embryo but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be positive!\u00a0 The failure of FET shattered us both emotionally n physically but Ma'am motivated us n asked us to go for next cycle. We then went for next cycle of FET but before the transfer could happen, I started bleeding n thus my cycle got cancelled. We were then suggested to go for blastocyst transfer in the next cycle. Unfortunately, none of the embryos developed to blastocyst on the day of transfer and again the cycle got cancelled. I started with the medicine to induce periods n then I get a call from the hospital that one of the embryos have made it to the blastocyst stage (it was a slow developing blastocyst). As I had already started with the medicine, the blastocyst was frozen for the next cycle. In the next cycle, our last set of embryos were used and luckily one of them made it to the blastocyst stage. So the two blastocyst were transferred on May 2019 and after a long wait of 3 years we got a positive result on June 2019 and a healthy baby boy was on born January 2020. We would like to thank Dr. Divyashree Ma'am for encouraging us, motivating us, guiding us and helping us in completing our family. Ma'am your advice \"Worrying will not help!\" always helped me in overcoming my stress during this tough journey. We would also like to thank all the junior doctors especially Dr.Shravya for always answering our queries n clearing out doubts. Lastly, I would like to recommend Dr.Divyashree to all the couples who wants to complete their family! Her diagnosis is very apt and explains the further treatment very clearly. She is very methodical and remembers the history of every patient very well!",

One of my friend suggested Dr.Divyashree  trust me they lived up to & beyond my expectations. We visited Genea in April 2021. The very first thing I was asked to reduce my weight this was just to avoid complication during pregnancy since I was overweight. Over a time with Diet and Yoga I have reduced 28kgs and my lifestyle has completely changed. By doing YOGA and just following DIET given to me I was preparing my body for IVF success. After reducing good amount of weight IVF process started and I was just waiting for Embryo transfer. But now I am happy to announce the we have conceived naturally and I am now 6 weeks pregnant. I would like to thank Dr Divyashree for making our dream come true. Just believe in Ma\u2019am and follow instructions given by ma\u2019am. All our dreams regarding our parenthood will definitely come true.",

Dr Divyashree's diagnosis was spot on from the very first visit. moreover, as a couple, we were made very comfortable which made it easy for us to discuss our problems and solutions openly. we could not continue the treatment at that time due to unavoidable reasons. Again, we started the treatment again in 2019 and unfortunately things did not work in our favour and we had a double miscarriage. But, Dr Divyashree ensured that we don't give up and her consultation really helped us staying positive and post initial covid lockdown, we went ahead with the treatment again in Apr 2020. And, in line with our trust with Dr Divyashree, we are now proud parents of a baby boy. The way we were advised about the delivery procedure and the confidence induced by Dr Divyashree is second to none. she made us stay positive and strong which helped us having a normal delivery. we will highly recommend Dr Divyashree and her hospital Genea Fertilility Centre. we are sure you won't be disappointed.

I was undergone 2nd IVF at Genea. Within 2 months of the treatment the result just brought tears in our eyes. Yes, it's a positive pregnancy. Very friendly staff and Doctor too. I strongly suggest that this is the best place to solve your problem if you also suffering from fertility issue. Thankyou Dr Divyashree and hospital staff",

                "review_text": "My emotional journey towards Motherhood!!Hope is the only thing stronger than Fear\"Never give up on dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it\"Our journey of trying to conceive started in 2009 (after 3 years of Marriage). Failed to conceive naturally without any luck.  I was diagnosed with fibroids and underwent a Laparoscopic surgery in 2010 to remove it and correct the adhesions. After that, we tried to conceive naturally again with no success. We had to shift to different clinic nearby home by end of 2010 to avoid too much of travelling. As per Dr\u2019s suggestion went through 3 cycles of IUI before going for IVF in 2012. First Embryo transfer failed, eventually 2nd Embryo Transfer was positive, however the happiness was short lived, because I miscarried at 8 weeks and the doctor said it was due to UTI. We were devasted at this point, had lost hope...our energy, patience, mental & physical stability...everything was drained. The Doctor also did not give us any hope. We started focusing on our career, betterment of personal life.Restarted the journey in 2019. Upon our own research consulted Dr. Divyashree at Milann Hospital.  We could feel the positive vibe and encouragement in our first meet itself.  I had to undergo another laparoscopic surgery due to severe stage 4 Endometriosis and Adenomyosis before 2nd IVF attempt, unfortunately IVF cycle was unsuccessful.  We moved to Genea Clinic when Dr. Divyashree started of her own to begin our 2 half of the journey.At Genea we tried 4 IVF non-stop cycles including the pandemic period in a span of 4 years (5 failed Embryo Transfers, 2 cancelled Embryo transfer due to embryo not turning into Blastocyst and 1 Embryo transfer turned into twin conception).  After failure of 3 cycles & the required surgeries/procedures, we weren\u2019t in a good position to continue & lost hope and financially drained.  After few days we were called upon to meet Dr. Divyashree and the Dr. persuaded us to try one last time, for which we are grateful for her generosity and her level of personal attention towards us.We didn\u2019t want to disappoint her and went ahead with the suggested plan and ET was done with 2 embryos with no expectations whatsoever.  To our surprise, miracle happened with twin conception on 14th Jun 2023.  We & everyone at Genea were equally happy and celebrating our success.  Dr. Divyashree was triumphant & very happy, emotional at the same time.  We are so lucky that Genea family was with us in every step, situation. Dr. Divyashree & Dr. Chaithra took very good care of me because of the complication and suggested we have frequent scans to closely monitor. \u2003At 9th week scan we got to know that one of the twin heartbeat had stopped and the other was healthy, hence I was closely monitored from then.  Unfortunately, the 2nd baby's growth was restricted at 18 weeks due to placental problem and preeclampsia.  Dr. Divyashree and Dr. Chaithra suggested to do a blood test to see the level of risk I was in before continuing and the risk was reported as too high to continue and my BP was shooting up despite of medication. With heavy heart Dr. Chaithra suggested we have to terminate the pregnancy before I get into severe risk. We terminated the pregnancy on Oct 13th and lost our baby girl.  This emotional & painful journey of 14 years (with 3 major laparoscopic surgeries, 3 minor procedures, 3 IUIs, & 6 IVF cycles) ended at Motherhood Hospital!Even though we could not take our bundle of joy home, we are writing this to urge other couples who are trying to conceive, that always have patience. Infertility treatment and IVF is not an easy journey as you all know...but with patience, hope, healthy eating habits, yoga, meditation, you can make it an easy process.  When we saw frequent failures, we made up our mind and was always prepared for any outcome. That\u2019s when the pain of failure did not affect us too much every single time and we were ready for the next round in no time.  We have no guilt or regrets as we always felt that we went to the right Doctor. I have seen many patients who have conceived naturally, first time in IUI, first cycle of ivf.  Dr. Divyashree is an expert who diagnoses your issues and suggests the right kind of treatment. I have gone to different hospitals, different doctors, but never met anyone like her. Kind and compassionate, professional and always eager to help all the patients. I definitely did not feel like she was my doctor. She was always like a close friend taking care of us in every step and always gave us hope. She explained all the procedures, technicalities even before we had a doubt. Dr. Chaithra was also very helpful and supportive throughout my pregnancy and especially during the termination process. She herself followed up every few hours due to my condition.My husband and myself could go through this long and tough journey and would like to recommend these learnings to all the couples going through this journey:1. Have Patience... It is the key to success2. Never lose Hope3. Have Faith and trust in yourself (very important), in your doctors. Especially Doctor like Dr. Divyashree and her team, they will always guide to the right path4. Don\u2019t Stress too much... Practice yoga, meditation, have healthy eating habits (which will help to improve your health and chances)5. DO NOT delay your treatment6. Trust yourself and the processWe would whole heartedly thank Dr. Divyashree, Dr. Chaithra, Dr. Rashmi, Mr. Hemanth, Mr. Nandish & all the staffs of Genea (to name a few: Bhagya, Preethi, Ashwini, Arjun, Gowdru, Sindhu, Vishalu, Bhanu, Suma, Asha etc\u2026.) who are very kind and helpful, we will always recommend them to other patients.Wishing Genea team all the success in fulfilling every couple's dream of becoming parents!",

But because for various reasons, she was unavailable and we had to start consulting with another Doctor. \nAs fate would have it, after going back to Dr Divyasree for consultation again, we are now blessed with a baby girl. \nAfter having consulted in a MultiChain IVF center, initial visits to Genea were a totally different experience and we were starting to have doubts. But all those doubts were put to rest later. \nTo all future parents, Genea is driven by team of passionate \"All Rounders\" headed by Dr Divyasree herself. Given the multiple roles each of the Team members handles, it will take some waiting, but it's worth it. \n\nSo After 7 years of trying with failed attempts of IVF earlier due to various reasons [ Covid, Still growth] we had almost lost all hope when we went to Dr.Divyasree. She took up our case as a challenge and challenged her team as well to have this case a Success. \nWhen Dr.Divyasree said that it's her gut feeling that all the parameters are looking good and we shall try IVF again, we ourselves didn't have any hope left, but we blindly trusted her and went ahead which gifted us parenthood today. \nDr.Divyasree has immense memory, despite seeing so many patients, she remembers the details of each of the patient and keeps following up on them.\nDr.Divyasree , Dr.Rashmi, Dr. Nandini Patil, and Dr.Chaitra with smiles on their face, were always making us feel positive and provided great support. To put it in a word they were \"BINDAAS\". The conversations used to be Friendly than like a typical \"Dr and Patient\" \nAll the doctors were available whenever we required their help and moreover they were very transparent in explaining all the details/risks.  \nDr. Rashmi and Dr. Chaitra - with their expertise helped us to overcome a few complexities.  \n\nAshwini, Sindhu, Arjun, Preeti, Bhanu, Suma, Asha, and all the other staff at Genea are amazingly friendly, they made us feel comfortable. This is what sets them apart from the Multichain Clinics. The personal touch. \n\nThank You Team Genea.\n\nTo All aspiring parents, No treatment is 100% Success. It needs lots of Patience and Perseverance. Dont lose hope and Trust the Doctors. \nAt Genea, they have not prescribed any unwanted tests or scans nor they have charged exorbitantly. Infact it's more economical than most others. Highly recommend Genea.  ",

                "review_text": "I would like to share my experience of three years of infertility treatment. I had conceived in 2016 but unfortunately it was an ectopic pregnancy and I partially lost my right fallopian tube during the surgery. After that my struggle to conceive began! We tried to conceive again but it didn't happen. Our doctor then put me on medication to ovulate but most of my cycles got cancelled as I mostly ovulated from the right. After numerous cycles got cancelled, our doctor suggested us to go for IUI with injections. After bearing the pain of injections for two cycles, we still didn't get positive result. It was a stressful period for us as we had already lost two years trying. Our doctor then suggested us to go for IVF. We then approached Dr.Divyashree Ma'am of Milann and went to meet her (May 2018) to discuss our case for IVF. She was very clear and explained us the next course of action to be taken. She suggested us to undergo few tests and to try for two cycles of IUI. The IUI cycles didn't result in positive and then we decided to move to IVF. The next three cycles we couldn't start with the IVF process as my hormones weren't on the expected range. Finally on December 2018, my IVF cycle started but as I had overstimulated, the embryos were frozen. In January, we went for FET and transferred two 8 cell embryo but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be positive!\u00a0 The failure of FET shattered us both emotionally n physically but Ma'am motivated us n asked us to go for next cycle. We then went for next cycle of FET but before the transfer could happen, I started bleeding n thus my cycle got cancelled. We were then suggested to go for blastocyst transfer in the next cycle. Unfortunately, none of the embryos developed to blastocyst on the day of transfer and again the cycle got cancelled. I started with the medicine to induce periods n then I get a call from the hospital that one of the embryos have made it to the blastocyst stage (it was a slow developing blastocyst). As I had already started with the medicine, the blastocyst was frozen for the next cycle. In the next cycle, our last set of embryos were used and luckily one of them made it to the blastocyst stage. So the two blastocyst were transferred on May 2019 and after a long wait of 3 years we got a positive result on June 2019 and a healthy baby boy was on born January 2020. We would like to thank Dr. Divyashree Ma'am for encouraging us, motivating us, guiding us and helping us in completing our family. Ma'am your advice \"Worrying will not help!\" always helped me in overcoming my stress during this tough journey. We would also like to thank all the junior doctors especially Dr.Shravya for always answering our queries n clearing out doubts. Lastly, I would like to recommend Dr.Divyashree to all the couples who wants to complete their family! Her diagnosis is very apt and explains the further treatment very clearly. She is very methodical and remembers the history of every patient very well!",

One of my friend suggested Dr.Divyashree  trust me they lived up to & beyond my expectations. We visited Genea in April 2021. The very first thing I was asked to reduce my weight this was just to avoid complication during pregnancy since I was overweight. Over a time with Diet and Yoga I have reduced 28kgs and my lifestyle has completely changed. By doing YOGA and just following DIET given to me I was preparing my body for IVF success. After reducing good amount of weight IVF process started and I was just waiting for Embryo transfer. But now I am happy to announce the we have conceived naturally and I am now 6 weeks pregnant. I would like to thank Dr Divyashree for making our dream come true. Just believe in Ma\u2019am and follow instructions given by ma\u2019am. All our dreams regarding our parenthood will definitely come true.",

Dr Divyashree's diagnosis was spot on from the very first visit. moreover, as a couple, we were made very comfortable which made it easy for us to discuss our problems and solutions openly. we could not continue the treatment at that time due to unavoidable reasons. Again, we started the treatment again in 2019 and unfortunately things did not work in our favour and we had a double miscarriage. But, Dr Divyashree ensured that we don't give up and her consultation really helped us staying positive and post initial covid lockdown, we went ahead with the treatment again in Apr 2020. And, in line with our trust with Dr Divyashree, we are now proud parents of a baby boy. The way we were advised about the delivery procedure and the confidence induced by Dr Divyashree is second to none. she made us stay positive and strong which helped us having a normal delivery. we will highly recommend Dr Divyashree and her hospital Genea Fertilility Centre. we are sure you won't be disappointed.

Few couple find it difficult to achieve the stage, we were one of them. It was a 6yrs of tough time we tried to conceive. We visited other hospitals & met few doctors where we didn't succeed.      After a failures of 5 IUI & 2IVF cycles, we didn't lose hope & never gave up. We researched a lot & chose \"Milann\"      We met Dr. Divyashree who examined our case with previous failures. After the consultation I really felt 'I am in safe hands now', I decided she is the person who will help me with my issues, then it proved, yes I was correct.      Dr. Divyashree handles the case with personal interest, she handles each & every case very sensitively. She speaks to every couple in each session & explains clealrly what is been happening & what is the treatment, medications we are undergoing, she is always very soft spoken & make the patient comfortable in all aspects understanding the mental & physical ability of a patient     After 2 failures again 3rd was a failure, but doctor's words of not to loose hopes was the only strength that prepared me for the next successful cycle. Assistant doctors at milann are also very helpful & kind.   I really thank Dr. Divyashree & team from bottom of my heart for helping us. Their expertise * ********* have bought lights into many families who wanted  to get over with infertility issues.     Every case will have different problems, few may sort immediately, but few definitely take some time to sort. Do not lose hope, do not give up, have patience, stay calm, every one will have one good day.      Finally, I would like to strongly recommend Dr. Divyashree for the couple who are facing Infertility issues.",

She is always very clear on the kind of treatment to be given to patients and her approach towards patients is amazing. We are forever grateful to you doctor for giving our dearest daughter.

My aunt who is a gynecologist, suggested me to Dr. Divyashree. We then decided to move ahead with IVF procedure. I have now tested positive with first embryo transfer. Thank you so much Dr. Divyashree for your support, proper treatment and right advice. The procedure was smooth. There are a lot of myths about not going for ivf under 30 years of age etc. But, i suggest do things at the proper time depending upon your condition. Once again thank you Dr. Divyashree.",

I was under treatment for IVF and constant observation under doctor and her wonderful and friendly team for about two months and the result just brought tears in our eyes. Yes, it's a positive pregnancy.  \nSo here's to all couple that you are in safe hands. Don't worry if you too are suffering from endometriosis,  you can still be pregnant. I strongly recommend Dr Divyashree for any type of infertility treatment and pregnancy consultation. \nI cannot thank her enough for giving us this happiness that we were longing for . \nThankyou Dr Divyashree and team Genea ",

She was very patient, comfortly heard all our concerns and most importantly genuinely concerned about our well being .We were so comfortable and convinced in her presence that we decided to go for IVF treatment.\n\nshe was not hurrying for IVF,all other possible  ways and tests were done before going for IVF. \nThe medicine she prescribed worked well. Even I see other patients getting success very soon on first or second attempt.  I recommend others whole heartedly to visit Doctor Divyashree for any infertility concerns .\n\nAnd in first attempt of IVF we got a positive result :) ",

When I was dejected after five months of treatment and no luck of pregnancy Dr . Divyashree and Dr. Rashmi convinced me and cheered me up. Finally was able to concieve through IUI. I am thankful to the staff of Genea fertility too.Post pregnancy Dr.Rashmi guided me throughout . Yoga sessions with Dr . Manjusha is what I waited for during my pregnancy.

We just followed her prescriptions and instructions and finally she delivered what we have been expecting all these years.  She does lot of analysis on each case and do the right thing at right time. Just believed in her. We got positive news from the doctor that my wife is pregnant after the blood test. Thanks a lot doctor. It really means a lot to us.",

Dr Divyashree reads the history of the patience very well. After few IVF cycle failures we were pressurised and dejected and felt void. Normally after couple of IVF failure cycles people change the doctor, We believed in the Dr Divyashree and she was the one who can make our dreams come true and Dr Divyashree gave us hope, confidence and patience during our tough times and moved ahead with the treatment.\nFinally, a day came what we wanted to hear, pregnancy was positive. And dream come true, we were blessed with twins baby boy and baby girl.  \n\nShe not only support patient with medicines . She also support mentally and emotionally for the couples.\n\nI would definitely recommend others for infertility issues and also, If things works out with no second thought, i would go for second pregnancy \nto Dr Divyashree . \n\nBunch of thanks for Dr Divyashree for fulfilling our dreams :)",

Things were not working out and our doctor finally suggested to consult Dr. Divyashree once. My wife went through little trauma and amid all the confusions we came and went through all the check ups. Doctor personally called our initial doctor who referred us to check all the past treatments and the issues my wife had gone through and then the doctor has started with the treatments and with in 2 months my wife got conceived. But it couldn't with hold and that's how the nature is. My wife went through lot of agony during this time but she moved forward after caring and friendly advice from the doctor. We took a break for few months and approached the doctor again to go ahead with the treatment and doctor has suggested to do yoga coupled with the medical treatments for better results and exactly after one month she got conceived and the results are really good this time. We are really happy after all the disturbing moments we had. We kept the trust and didn't loose hope on the doctor. It's the trust and caring nature gave lot of positive energy to my wife. ",

In all these years, there are top infertility centers we have visited, top gynecologist treated us, underwent gynecology treatments like laparoscopy and IUI. Though reports were all normal yet I was not able to conceive. \n\nI am sure that most of the couple would have given up with the amount of time, energy, money and mental trauma we had undergone in all these years. But, we did not give up and we had all the patience waiting for the right day. Anyone who is reading this, please remember that \u201cPatience and Time are the two great warriors\u201d which will make you \u2018WIN\u201d when you had lost all the hope. \n\nThat is when we happened to get an information about \u2018Milann, JP Nagar\u2019 and we met Dr. Divyashree. We are really pleased the way she handled our case. She scrutinizes each case personally *** **** *** ********** ***** ********** Her words will always motivates anyone and will not let loose hope. In our case she recommended for IVF, believe it or not, now after 1st IVF cycle I am conceived.\n\nWe are sure that there are more couples like us who would have lost all their hopes. But we would recommend them to visit Milann and consult Dr. Divyashree. Remember trusting attitude and a patience attitude go hand in hand and have trust in God. It release joy in life.\n\nThank you to Dr. Divyashree and team\n\n-\tGeetha Prashanth\n",

This has been made possible under able supervision of Dr. Bhavani, Dr. Meghana and Dr. Divyashree - the trio has been backbone of Milann JP Nagar for fertility treatment.

Her constant guidance and tracking month by month, though was making me impatient at times but was definitely helping her better understand us as patients and come up with correct diagnosis. Step by step she treated us and here we are - expecting twins by end of an year. I would like to thank both dr. Divyashree and Dr. Rashmi for taking the correct and essential steps in this successful pregnancy so far. \nI recommend the doctor for all those who stay close to the hospital.

Don\u2019t give a second thought , go visit her & fulfil your dreams . But in fact IVF treatment itself is costly and the only pain is waiting period is more as she only scans the patient individually and take care of consultation also which is time consuming . I totally recommend Dr. Divyashree . Thank you doctor. ",

If you remember even from the first consultation, I have only spoken to you regarding the probability of pregnancy or success rates. In Medical fraternity we can never promise 100 percent. The fact that you tried 3 IVFs with me itself speaks about the belief you had in me. Again I tell you the same thing you have done your best at the same time I have done my best. Please understand pregnancy is not a commodity, that I spend money and I have to get it. It's a war we both are fighting against nature. We win many a times but at times we do fail and that is what I have tried to explain. Again I empathise with you. May God bless you.

I didn't get enough eggs and the quality of egg retrieved was really poor. We didn't even get a single 8cell embryo. Consulted many doctors and all were recommending IVF with egg donor. Finally went for IVF with donor eggs. There were no options after this for us. And that was also a failure. We were in no hope. Next month after my donor cycle, I got pregnant naturally. Currently in my 6th week. \nDr.Divyashree told few things are beyond science. Feels like I am experiencing a miracle. Waiting for the arrival of our bundle of joy, under the grace of God and guidance of Dr.Divyashree. ",

I wanted to conceive naturally but remained unsuccessful for two months then i visited Hospital Milan and took appointment of Dr Divyashree. Firstly, she listened to my problem of not conceiving very carefully then she explained in a very friendly manner that its just one year of our marriage we can try naturally. For that she did some blood tests, some scans and prescribed one medicine. What happened??? I didn't get my periods next month and i thought may be its cycle is increased because of medication. But, when i did the pregnancy test at home it came positive and when i told Doctor that i conceived Naturally, she was very happy and called me for EPS scan in which she confirmed my pregnancy. I will suggest to every women who is scared of infertility or not able to conceive naturally should consult Dr. Divyashree. She is amazing Doctor.",

Madam has lot of patience to listen our problems and she helps us to understand the problem & treatment clearly along with giving a lot of confidence and not loose hope. And we never miss a smile on her face even if we ask some silly questions. With golden hands, the treatment got success on first month only and now after nine months (Dec 2018)  we are blessed with a Baby Boy. We consulted madam at Jayanagar branch,  Bangalore. Our's is a second kid in family from Milann, few years ago my little cousin also gave  birth with help of Milann,  Kumarapark branch. And the supporting Doctors & staff are also so kind and helpful through out the treatment. ",

It was fibroid and had to be operated without further delay. I have liked her confidence level and decision making skill which was absent in previous consultations with other doctors. She explains the root cause very well and also have great listening skills. All the queries that we had were answered in a single consultation. Exactly after one year am blessed with baby boy. We strongly recommend that you visit her if you are sailing on the same boat. I wish Dr. Divyashree a great success in all her future endeavours..Regards",

She never forced us into unnecessary procedures nor did she try to  scare us. She kept us focused and positive. We felt she  was very thorough with the process as well. They measure and monitor hormone levels very regularly and make sure they intervene at the exact time. The process in Milann is also very holistic, if you decide to go through with IVF. They have specialists who explain the financial aspect in detailed fashion, counsellors who evaluate your frame of mind and make sure you remain positive, yoga sessions to help you deal with stress, diet sessions etc. After several years of frustration, I became pregnant within 6 months of Consulting with Divyashree and delivered a healthy baby couple of months back.",

So please respect my time and the time of fellow patients and also please don\u2019t ask questions in the corridors as you did last time, it doesn\u2019t look good to stop the doctor in the corridor and ask your doubts in front of everyone. With all due respect for you, I agree, I refused to answer your question in the corridor. Next time you ask your doubts within the four walls of consultation room, I will be more than happy to answer all your queries.
