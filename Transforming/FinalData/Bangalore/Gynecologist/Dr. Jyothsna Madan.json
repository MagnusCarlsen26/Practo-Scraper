There was no other doubts thereafter.\r\n\r\nBefore consulting Dr. Jyothsna, we had consulted one of the Gynecologist in Narayana Health hospital for  frequent stomach pain, they confirmed that there was some issues in right ovary ( ovary torsion) and asked us to get ready for the surgery without any delay. but that was ridiculous as they were hiding something and said surgery cost is in 3 to 4 lakhs. suddenly we got shocked and started thinking about some second opinion. \r\nOne of my friends suggested Dr.Jyothsna who is so experienced works in Manipal Hospital Jayanagar.  We have shown the reports (Narayana Health) but she strongly suspect ectopic pregnancy and immediately started pelvic scanning. She conformed the exact issue but sent us for one more scanning ( sri hari diagnostics) to double confirm the issue. yes, Radiologist doctor Krishna immediately provided the report in his busy schedule based on Jyothsna recommendation. It was so emergency situation as the surgery should happen immediately.\r\nDr. Jyothsna coordinated with manipal hospital staffs to set up OT to start the surgery immediately and completed the it without any delay. she is very good and honest doctor. she fought with Hospital management to reduce the overall surgery cost as no doctor will fight with hospital management.\r**** *** * ********* ******I would like to say many thanks to madam for dedicated support. I would recommend her for any treatment related to Gynecology.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nSanthosh\r\n",

There was no other doubts thereafter.\r\n\r\nBefore consulting Dr. Jyothsna, we had consulted one of the Gynecologist in Narayana Health hospital for  frequent stomach pain, they confirmed that there was some issues in right ovary ( ovary torsion) and asked us to get ready for the surgery without any delay. but that was ridiculous as they were hiding something and said surgery cost is in 3 to 4 lakhs. suddenly we got shocked and started thinking about some second opinion. \r\nOne of my friends suggested Dr.Jyothsna who is so experienced works in Manipal Hospital Jayanagar.  We have shown the reports (Narayana Health) but she strongly suspect ectopic pregnancy and immediately started pelvic scanning. She conformed the exact issue but sent us for one more scanning ( sri hari diagnostics) to double confirm the issue. yes, Radiologist doctor Krishna immediately provided the report in his busy schedule based on Jyothsna recommendation. It was so emergency situation as the surgery should happen immediately.\r\nDr. Jyothsna coordinated with manipal hospital staffs to set up OT to start the surgery immediately and completed the it without any delay. she is very good and honest doctor. she fought with Hospital management to reduce the overall surgery cost as no doctor will fight with hospital management.\r**** *** * ********* ******I would like to say many thanks to madam for dedicated support.
