"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Fertilisation In Vitro - Embryo Transfer (IVF - ET),",0,0,YES,"Our marriage has lasted about 10 years and we've tried many options in Bengaluru for conceiving a child. There was no success.

As a patient, finding a gynecologist who not only possesses exceptional medical expertise but also exudes warmth and compassion can be a daunting task. However, my search came to a gratifying end when I discovered Dr. Akhila Anand.


From the moment I stepped into the Hospital, I was greeted by a friendly and efficient staff, setting the tone for a positive experience. 


Dr. Akhila Anand herself is a consummate professional, ************* * ***** ** ********* *** expertise that instilled confidence in me from the outset. She took the time to thoroughly listen to my concerns, asking pertinent questions and addressing each with care and attention to detail. Her ability to communicate complex medical information in a clear and understandable manner was truly commendable, leaving me feeling informed and empowered in my healthcare decisions.

What truly sets Dr. Akhila Anand apart, however, is her genuine concern for her patients' well-being. Beyond just treating symptoms, she takes a holistic approach, considering not only the physical but also the emotional aspects of health. Her empathy and bedside manner are second to none, making even the most sensitive discussions feel comfortable and respectful.

During examinations and procedures, Dr. Akhila Anand maintained a reassuring demeanor, ensuring I felt comfortable and supported throughout. Her gentle and skilled approach inspired confidence, making what could have been an anxiety-inducing experience surprisingly manageable.


We 100% recommend Dr. Akhila Anand. She is not just a competent gynecologist but a compassionate healthcare provider who genuinely cares for the well-being of her patients. My experience under her care has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am grateful to have her as my trusted medical partner. 

I'm conceiving for the first time now and I'm excited and nervous at the same time. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me and nervous about the challenges I'll have to face. I can't wait to meet my baby.

If you're in search of a gynecologist who combines expertise with compassion, look no further than Dr. Akhila Anand.
