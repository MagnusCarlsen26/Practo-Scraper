Explained to me all the details with patience . Best thing is she never scares you . You will be feeling safe with her at each stage of pregnancy. Shes well aware with all the latest updates. par with all the health advices received from foreign professionals.  I strongly recommend Dr Anita. Each pregnant lady deserves a Dr like her.",

But here I really want to write about Anitha Ma'am as it might help others.\n We shifted to Bangalore from Delhi six months back and approached almost 5-6 doctors. All were good but we were still skeptical and were not feeling confident. But after meeting Anitha Ma'am for the first time we were sure that we will be in safe hands. She is 10/10 in her work, understanding of new tech and making this journey comfortable. \n\nMy topmost worry has always been that many doctors recommend those treatments which are not required and might harm you in long run. We all know that it's not about money for a patient but the side effects and emotional trauma involved. Also we can't do much about it as we are completely dependent on doctors' advice. But here it was a pleasant surprise to see the other side :)\n\nShe will try her best for the normal and painless delivery without any doubt. \n\nIn short, if you are looking for a experienced, cool and genuine doctor then she is the best we have met so far. And in case you also opt her for this most important part of life then one day you will also write such a long feedback like me :)\nAll the best!\n",

Throughout the consultation she has been very good though she doesn\u2019t talk much but whatever queries we raise she responds to it immediately. She is always available 24/7 and responds to our call or SMS or Whatsapp. I had a normal delivery and my experience throughout the labor was just Awesome. I still cherish those moments when ever I think about it.  She used to advise me on weight management, diet and exercise like Yoga during my pregnancy. I always followed her advise and I am proud mother of my Son who turns 6 months in another 7 days. It has proved me right that, a healthy mother can always deliver a healthy baby through normal delivery and I am fortunate enough to be one among them. I will always recommend this Doctor to my friends, relatives or any well wisher or anyone who is reading my feedback now. I always wanted to put forth my feedback in this site coz I too went through all the feedbacks of other patients. Since me and my husband found more positive feedbacks from other mothers, we decided to go with this doctor and fortunately we landed in the safe hands. I always rate Dr. Anitha Rao 10 on 10. My best wishes for all the Expected Mothers.",

We started with this doctor when my wife conceived. My wife got very good confidence on the doctor consultation. We decided to continue with this doctor only. Staff in this clinic are also nice and cooperative. Appointment may not start exactly on the provided time because previous patients would be spending time with doctor to clear their doubts. So even though appointment may not start on time, We were happy because she provided all the details and clarifies our doubts. We were first time parents, so had many silly doubts which doctor clarified. We should not think much about appointment starting on time or little late. Focus was on mother and baby, which doctor provided. Doctor Anitha Rao had given all good and right directions thought out the pregnancy. She also advised on the type of diet my wife should have. Had not given any unnecessary medicines until it is needed. Doctor constantly monitored the weight and health of pregnant mother. Doctor had cleared all our doubts. Doctor had told that we always give preference to Normal delivery and continuously provided the right guidance like diet, exercise. Doctor had clearly told that walk atleast 30 minutes every day is must. So we blindly followed her advise. My wife delivered to baby girl. Both mother and Baby are healthy. I would recommend to this doctor. ",

Everyone there are very careless from receptionist to doctor. They don't treat polite and sweet. They are busy with mobiles and enjoying not responding well. May be for the doctor it's common and she sees many pregnant woman in a day but for each individual it is not common very special. This doctor has too much attitude because she is good at treating it doesn't mean she can treat patients however she want. She is not at all friendly. She is not doing anything for free actually we are paying huge. Let her keep her attitude at home not with patients even we are working ladies even we have our ego. For me it's first time and I don't know anything about pregnancy. She just did good makeup and sat there no smile nothing. And she just answering for whatever I ask for like a robot. She didn't interact well with me. And sometimes talking and replying in a very criticising way as if I did something wrong being pregnant. Very bad. She didn't even give any precautions or suggestions on do's and don'ts. Any doctors first quality is to be freidnly and make patient comfortable to express their problems/ issues easily not get scared to even talk. Never take your wives there. Don't trouble a to be mothers. We need doc who is supportive and convincing when we are in this stage. If we keep meeting rude doctor like this for nine months may be it will impact on our kid too. Never never never please don't go this doc. She is only fit for apply makeup and sit. *** ****** ***** ********* ********* *** ****** **** ******** ** ***. And I hate her. She spoiled my mood. ",

During labour we were bit tensed but she was cool and done a great job. With her help my wife delivered healthy baby boy. It was normal delivery. Now both baby and mom are doing great. We could not ask for more. I will definitely recommend her if you are looking for good Gynecologist.",

But here I really want to write about Anitha Ma'am as it might help others.\n We shifted to Bangalore from Delhi six months back and approached almost 5-6 doctors. All were good but we were still skeptical and were not feeling confident. But after meeting Anitha Ma'am for the first time we were sure that we will be in safe hands. She is 10/10 in her work, understanding of new tech and making this journey comfortable. \n\nMy topmost worry has always been that many doctors recommend those treatments which are not required and might harm you in long run. We all know that it's not about money for a patient but the side effects and emotional trauma involved. Also we can't do much about it as we are completely dependent on doctors' advice. But here it was a pleasant surprise to see the other side :)\n\nShe will try her best for the normal and painless delivery without any doubt. \n\nIn short, if you are looking for a experienced, cool and genuine doctor then she is the best we have met so far. And in case you also opt her for this most important part of life then one day you will also write such a long feedback like me :)\nAll the best!\n",

Throughout the consultation she has been very good though she doesn\u2019t talk much but whatever queries we raise she responds to it immediately. She is always available 24/7 and responds to our call or SMS or Whatsapp. I had a normal delivery and my experience throughout the labor was just Awesome. I still cherish those moments when ever I think about it.  She used to advise me on weight management, diet and exercise like Yoga during my pregnancy. I always followed her advise and I am proud mother of my Son who turns 6 months in another 7 days. It has proved me right that, a healthy mother can always deliver a healthy baby through normal delivery and I am fortunate enough to be one among them. I will always recommend this Doctor to my friends, relatives or any well wisher or anyone who is reading my feedback now. I always wanted to put forth my feedback in this site coz I too went through all the feedbacks of other patients. Since me and my husband found more positive feedbacks from other mothers, we decided to go with this doctor and fortunately we landed in the safe hands. I always rate Dr. Anitha Rao 10 on 10. My best wishes for all the Expected Mothers.",

We started with this doctor when my wife conceived. My wife got very good confidence on the doctor consultation. We decided to continue with this doctor only. Staff in this clinic are also nice and cooperative. Appointment may not start exactly on the provided time because previous patients would be spending time with doctor to clear their doubts. So even though appointment may not start on time, We were happy because she provided all the details and clarifies our doubts. We were first time parents, so had many silly doubts which doctor clarified. We should not think much about appointment starting on time or little late. Focus was on mother and baby, which doctor provided. Doctor Anitha Rao had given all good and right directions thought out the pregnancy. She also advised on the type of diet my wife should have. Had not given any unnecessary medicines until it is needed. Doctor constantly monitored the weight and health of pregnant mother. Doctor had cleared all our doubts. Doctor had told that we always give preference to Normal delivery and continuously provided the right guidance like diet, exercise. Doctor had clearly told that walk atleast 30 minutes every day is must. So we blindly followed her advise. My wife delivered to baby girl. Both mother and Baby are healthy. I would recommend to this doctor. ",

Everyone there are very careless from receptionist to doctor. They don't treat polite and sweet. They are busy with mobiles and enjoying not responding well. May be for the doctor it's common and she sees many pregnant woman in a day but for each individual it is not common very special. This doctor has too much attitude because she is good at treating it doesn't mean she can treat patients however she want. She is not at all friendly. She is not doing anything for free actually we are paying huge. Let her keep her attitude at home not with patients even we are working ladies even we have our ego. For me it's first time and I don't know anything about pregnancy. She just did good makeup and sat there no smile nothing. And she just answering for whatever I ask for like a robot. She didn't interact well with me. And sometimes talking and replying in a very criticising way as if I did something wrong being pregnant. Very bad. She didn't even give any precautions or suggestions on do's and don'ts. Any doctors first quality is to be freidnly and make patient comfortable to express their problems/ issues easily not get scared to even talk. Never take your wives there. Don't trouble a to be mothers. We need doc who is supportive and convincing when we are in this stage. If we keep meeting rude doctor like this for nine months may be it will impact on our kid too. Never never never please don't go this doc. She is only fit for apply makeup and sit. *** ****** ***** ********* ********* *** ****** **** ******** ** ***. And I hate her. She spoiled my mood. ",

Mine was a case of pre term delivery in 27 weeks but the Doctor handled the situation so nicely and prevented from pre term birth. I was very scared of normal delivery but doctor made me understand how the natural way of giving birth is good for mother and the baby and finally I delivered a healthy baby boy through normal delivery without much hassle and pain. In fact, people will forget pain just by the smile and the positiveness what doctor shows. She keeps on encouraging throughout the labor process. \nI highly recommend her for pre pregnancy, pregnancy and post pregnancy consultation. Thanks  to you doctor. You are the best.",
