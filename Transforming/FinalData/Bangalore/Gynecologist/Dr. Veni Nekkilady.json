This is my second pregnancy and all I wanted this time is to have VBAC delivery. Because recovery rate with C section was very slow for me during first time and it was very painful. So a doctor who would give consent for it was needed. Otherwise its a common thinking that if first one is a c section then subsequent deliveries will be the same. Dr. Veni agreed for our decision and we opted to have a delivery in Bengaluru this time. For me from the very first blood check up, gestational diabetes condition was identified. So it was a moderately risky pregnancy. She was very kind, friendly, supportive and patient in clearing all our queries. In fact as the pregnancy progressed I felt the comfort of a elder sister with her. There is 7 years of gap between my two children. For maintanence of blood sugar level medications and insulin, diabetes diet, walking, exercises...etc were included. It was tough as I was not allowed to eat any sweets or carbs in the form of white rice. So had to control all my cravings. But all those sacrifices gave fruitful result in the form of a handsome baby boy at the end through induced labor. Labour took 14 hours in total and last 3 hours were only very intense. Our prince came to this world on the eve of Vishu festival. Thats how my dream to experience a vaginal delivery was accomplished. Finally we became complete family with one girl and another boy child. Dr. Veni even helped us thoroughly in referring a good pediatrician as our son developed jaundice on the 5th day after discharge from the hospital. ** ***** ****** ** ******* **** *** ************ **** ***** ********* ******** ** *** ** *** **** ************ ** **** **** ** **** We have seen god in form of doctors and our son this time. Thank you so much Dr. Veni.",

                "review_text": "They say you need to have a Doctor in the house. Reason - health care is one of the most stressful experience for all. Especially when you have to helplessly follow the pre appointments , hospital visits , wait time and the excessive costs just to wait in line.  It's least of my effort to share this story to the world, of the superhero in our pregnancy journey. Dr. Veni! 4 yrs into marriage and we started planning, twice resulted in chemical termination. that's when my spouse met Dr Veni. Calm observation, non stressful words, certain medication and lots of well wishes.Within a span of a month, we were successful . We expected more wait time but Dr's Advice worked magically. Our home town is not Bangalore so after the good news, we had to relocate. Pregnancy care is a pain in our home town, but thankfully we had a Doctor like family with us. Dr. Veni, she was available via whatsapp and Phone calls even for a slight unrest to the mother. She would ensure to follow up next day as well. How amazing it is when u can immediately reach out to ur doc rather than taking appointment and rushing to the local clinic every time the parents are panicked. especially first time parents. We even had the number of the local gynac in home town, she would only say visit me tomorrow. 5 months passed with Dr Veni holding us on her shoulders for every worry we had. Then we witnessed spotting. Very Scary! We informed Dr Veni! She was worried too. upon suggestion of Home town Dr, we came down to Bangalore for complete care of Dr Veni.Baby growth was not favorable, AFI(water content) was very low. Panic set in for Me and our family. We obtained 2 nd opinion from 4 top maternity hospitals of Bengaluru with their top doctors (1 month wait   7 hrs waiting time even after booking appointment 1 month ago)Result = Lots of tests   Creating a sense of Panic   moneySolution = let's see how things will change, follow up next week (7hrs waiting again)During this period came an emergency situation where there was no baby moment for 2.5 days. Dr Veni picked up the phone like a goddess . She was also on a family event outside BLR. She immediately called up her contacts in a top tier Hospital and got us immediately into emergency care. From that day, We will forever be gratefull to her! She became like our family member.She carried us all the way until 38 weeks, 100  calls , 08 consultations and  thousands of messages .We paid only for the consultations , but I'd rather pay 50x that amount for the upcoming part.At 38th week, Baby AFI was bare minimum at 8. Which means , if the baby head is not in delivery position, it would be impossible to physically make it so. We had to go into labor.I didn't want any other Doctor to Deliver my baby than Dr Veni, she is a renowned visiting Doc at 3 Major maternity hospitals at Banasawadi. We chose Cloud 9. Trust me, The Hospital is 10/10. Especially with the fan base that the the nursing staff has with Dr Veni N.After Admission :Ours is a traditional orthodox family where the first question is C or Normal. My wife had clearly specified , Doc! we have come so far. I can never have a C. Doc said, that's why I have got u here before ur water lever decreases. Admitted in 16th at 8pm, Wife not at all ready for delivery, but water lever too low Only one goal - Normal Vaginal DeliveryThis was a fight where, cervix is not ready , mind is not ready, but baby is in danger.  Yes if we had chosen C, we could have gotten it done immediately.Issues : no cervix dilation and effacement for 49 hours, worried and surprised nursing staff over the record 49 hrs of labour. Pressure over Dr VeniMeasures : Dr Veni was like \"Vanake Vobavva' our Kannada epitome of courage, resilience and confidence over abilities. I cannot mention technical detailsconclusion : Normal Vaginal Delivery to a beautiful girl after 49 hours on 19th . No jaundice, No emergency absolutely zero issues. Every staff of cloud nine has visited the baby and mother to appreciate and congratulate our NVD, Dr Veni has created a History in cloud nine on 19th. We went for a follow up to show baby to Dr at the premium VR Health Clinic. She told \"Visit Again' ;-)Remove your fear , if You have the ever smiling Doctor Veni By your side! I will forever be grateful to you Our Super Hero! God Bless",

We felt more comfortable as we start seeing her more. As there was no any complications,She motivated my wife for NVD, recommended exercises and diet to take. Due to her encouragement, my wife become mentally prepared for NVD. One week before the delivery, some vital parameters was down. She recommended some medications. During delivery, she suggested blood infusion as my wifes platelate count was low and amoinitic fluid level was at the boudary level. Other resident doctor at Ovum hospital suggested for c -section, but Dr Veni insisted for NVD. She gave medication for inducing labour pain. Finally, We were blessed with our angle daughter. She also recommended pedatrician as my daughter developed jaundice on her 5 th day. Overall, it has been nice journey  with ma'am. Thank you Dr. VENI.",

Within visit of one month I got my pregnancy with  her guidance and treatment. The way she treated me, explained us was excellent. 7 th month I had a threat of pre term  labour delivery. But with the treatment of Dr.Veni mam ,I have delivered my baby @ 38 weeks  4 days. And  that too she did normal delivery. What is appreciable in this is : baby had cord around her neck, I was diabetic ( Dr.veni mam helped me to maintain my sugar levels by maintaining diet. She was very strict about my sugar levels. N my sugar levels were normal throughout my pregnancy despite of getting GTT report diabetic.), Water levels were low. She asked me to admit me in ovum as she is associated with that hospital. With all her care , constant observation I got normal delivery. She is angel of our life. Our whole family thinks Dr Veni mam as God. She replies immediately on WhatsApp, responds immediately to our health needs. Not only that she helped us in many ways. Only talking to her would give me lots of strength and she made me to believe that I will get normal delivery. She is such a wonderful doctor i have ever seen in my whole life. Great knowledge, down to the earth, good hand , with best treatment facility. Madam words remain less to explain about u mam. I really love You soo much. And I am great fan of u. To write this I was soo emotional. Post delivery I got healed very quickly and doctor is still there with me , with us for all the support. Thank you will be small word mam. All our family love on u mam. * *** *** **** ****** ",

Her consideration for the delivery preferences coupled with her clarity in decision making gave us confidence even when we are not sure of outcomes. She really supported Normal Vaginal Delivery right till the end and tried safe intervention possible for a NVD. Her objectivity and considerate decision making makes us confident that we made the right choices in our pregnancy. \nThank you Dr.Veni for being with us throughout our pregnancy as a friend, as a mentor and as a doctor.\n\nA fantastically competent doctor that we would highly recommend.",

This is my second pregnancy and all I wanted this time is to have VBAC delivery. Because recovery rate with C section was very slow for me during first time and it was very painful. So a doctor who would give consent for it was needed. Otherwise its a common thinking that if first one is a c section then subsequent deliveries will be the same. Dr. Veni agreed for our decision and we opted to have a delivery in Bengaluru this time. For me from the very first blood check up, gestational diabetes condition was identified. So it was a moderately risky pregnancy. She was very kind, friendly, supportive and patient in clearing all our queries. In fact as the pregnancy progressed I felt the comfort of a elder sister with her. There is 7 years of gap between my two children. For maintanence of blood sugar level medications and insulin, diabetes diet, walking, exercises...etc were included. It was tough as I was not allowed to eat any sweets or carbs in the form of white rice. So had to control all my cravings. But all those sacrifices gave fruitful result in the form of a handsome baby boy at the end through induced labor. Labour took 14 hours in total and last 3 hours were only very intense. Our prince came to this world on the eve of Vishu festival. Thats how my dream to experience a vaginal delivery was accomplished. Finally we became complete family with one girl and another boy child. Dr. Veni even helped us thoroughly in referring a good pediatrician as our son developed jaundice on the 5th day after discharge from the hospital. ** ***** ****** ** ******* **** *** ************ **** ***** ********* ******** ** *** ** *** **** ************ ** **** **** ** **** We have seen god in form of doctors and our son this time.

                "review_text": "They say you need to have a Doctor in the house. Reason - health care is one of the most stressful experience for all. Especially when you have to helplessly follow the pre appointments , hospital visits , wait time and the excessive costs just to wait in line.  It's least of my effort to share this story to the world, of the superhero in our pregnancy journey. Dr. Veni! 4 yrs into marriage and we started planning, twice resulted in chemical termination. that's when my spouse met Dr Veni. Calm observation, non stressful words, certain medication and lots of well wishes.Within a span of a month, we were successful . We expected more wait time but Dr's Advice worked magically. Our home town is not Bangalore so after the good news, we had to relocate. Pregnancy care is a pain in our home town, but thankfully we had a Doctor like family with us. Dr. Veni, she was available via whatsapp and Phone calls even for a slight unrest to the mother. She would ensure to follow up next day as well. How amazing it is when u can immediately reach out to ur doc rather than taking appointment and rushing to the local clinic every time the parents are panicked. especially first time parents. We even had the number of the local gynac in home town, she would only say visit me tomorrow. 5 months passed with Dr Veni holding us on her shoulders for every worry we had. Then we witnessed spotting. Very Scary! We informed Dr Veni! She was worried too. upon suggestion of Home town Dr, we came down to Bangalore for complete care of Dr Veni.Baby growth was not favorable, AFI(water content) was very low. Panic set in for Me and our family. We obtained 2 nd opinion from 4 top maternity hospitals of Bengaluru with their top doctors (1 month wait   7 hrs waiting time even after booking appointment 1 month ago)Result = Lots of tests   Creating a sense of Panic   moneySolution = let's see how things will change, follow up next week (7hrs waiting again)During this period came an emergency situation where there was no baby moment for 2.5 days. Dr Veni picked up the phone like a goddess . She was also on a family event outside BLR. She immediately called up her contacts in a top tier Hospital and got us immediately into emergency care. From that day, We will forever be gratefull to her! She became like our family member.She carried us all the way until 38 weeks, 100  calls , 08 consultations and  thousands of messages .We paid only for the consultations , but I'd rather pay 50x that amount for the upcoming part.At 38th week, Baby AFI was bare minimum at 8. Which means , if the baby head is not in delivery position, it would be impossible to physically make it so. We had to go into labor.I didn't want any other Doctor to Deliver my baby than Dr Veni, she is a renowned visiting Doc at 3 Major maternity hospitals at Banasawadi. We chose Cloud 9. Trust me, The Hospital is 10/10. Especially with the fan base that the the nursing staff has with Dr Veni N.After Admission :Ours is a traditional orthodox family where the first question is C or Normal. My wife had clearly specified , Doc! we have come so far. I can never have a C. Doc said, that's why I have got u here before ur water lever decreases. Admitted in 16th at 8pm, Wife not at all ready for delivery, but water lever too low Only one goal - Normal Vaginal DeliveryThis was a fight where, cervix is not ready , mind is not ready, but baby is in danger.  Yes if we had chosen C, we could have gotten it done immediately.Issues : no cervix dilation and effacement for 49 hours, worried and surprised nursing staff over the record 49 hrs of labour. Pressure over Dr VeniMeasures : Dr Veni was like \"Vanake Vobavva' our Kannada epitome of courage, resilience and confidence over abilities. I cannot mention technical detailsconclusion : Normal Vaginal Delivery to a beautiful girl after 49 hours on 19th . No jaundice, No emergency absolutely zero issues. Every staff of cloud nine has visited the baby and mother to appreciate and congratulate our NVD, Dr Veni has created a History in cloud nine on 19th. We went for a follow up to show baby to Dr at the premium VR Health Clinic. She told \"Visit Again' ;-)Remove your fear , if You have the ever smiling Doctor Veni By your side! I will forever be grateful to you Our Super Hero! God Bless",

During our 1st meet only, she explained  everything about the course of treatment, medications for the next 9 months. She explained all our queries on each appointments. We felt more comfortable as we start seeing her more. As there was no any complications,She motivated my wife for NVD, recommended exercises and diet to take. Due to her encouragement, my wife become mentally prepared for NVD. One week before the delivery, some vital parameters was down. She recommended some medications. During delivery, she suggested blood infusion as my wifes platelate count was low and amoinitic fluid level was at the boudary level. Other resident doctor at Ovum hospital suggested for c -section, but Dr Veni insisted for NVD. She gave medication for inducing labour pain. Finally, We were blessed with our angle daughter. She also recommended pedatrician as my daughter developed jaundice on her 5 th day. Overall, it has been nice journey  with ma'am. Thank you Dr. VENI.",

Doctor with beautiful face, heart *** **** ********** Here is the story, I m 34 years old consulted  mam , as married late and had pcos history didn't wanted to take a chance to wait. Within visit of one month I got my pregnancy with  her guidance and treatment. The way she treated me, explained us was excellent. 7 th month I had a threat of pre term  labour delivery. But with the treatment of Dr.Veni mam ,I have delivered my baby @ 38 weeks  4 days. And  that too she did normal delivery. What is appreciable in this is : baby had cord around her neck, I was diabetic ( Dr.veni mam helped me to maintain my sugar levels by maintaining diet. She was very strict about my sugar levels. N my sugar levels were normal throughout my pregnancy despite of getting GTT report diabetic.), Water levels were low. She asked me to admit me in ovum as she is associated with that hospital. With all her care , constant observation I got normal delivery. She is angel of our life. Our whole family thinks Dr Veni mam as God. She replies immediately on WhatsApp, responds immediately to our health needs. Not only that she helped us in many ways. Only talking to her would give me lots of strength and she made me to believe that I will get normal delivery. She is such a wonderful doctor i have ever seen in my whole life. Great knowledge, down to the earth, good hand , with best treatment facility. Madam words remain less to explain about u mam. I really love You soo much. And I am great fan of u. To write this I was soo emotional. Post delivery I got healed very quickly and doctor is still there with me , with us for all the support. Thank you will be small word mam. All our family love on u mam. * *** *** **** ****** ",

Her consideration for the delivery preferences coupled with her clarity in decision making gave us confidence even when we are not sure of outcomes. She really supported Normal Vaginal Delivery right till the end and tried safe intervention possible for a NVD. Her objectivity and considerate decision making makes us confident that we made the right choices in our pregnancy. \nThank you Dr.Veni for being with us throughout our pregnancy as a friend, as a mentor and as a doctor.\n\nA fantastically competent doctor that we would highly recommend.",

I cant even imagine how i could have handled my pregnancy journey without her support and guidance. \n\nHer friendly approach, motherly care works at your subconscious level and gets everything go smooth. \nShe is a very humble and down to earth person who makes you feel at ease and comfortable. I had multiple issues through out. With all these there was sudden insulin resistence and high bp during my last triemester. Then i had slipped and had a fall during my 9th month. \n\nMam handled each and every problem with so much care and support. She constantly keeps in touch with you to check on how you progress. And the best part is she will always try for normal delivery, counsel you for normal delivery even if you choose to go with c section which is rare in todays scenerio. \n\nPost delivery my lil one had latching issues, i had low milk supply and mam continously comforted me to stay strong and recommended so many things that could help with milk supply. Also my baby had severe jaundice and we had frequent visits to hospital to consult the pead. At one point when we could not reach the pead and mam connected with the doc and helped us in that critical situation. I cant thank enough for her dedication and support. \n\nOnly mothers who have taken treatment from Dr. Veni can understand how much it means to them. My sincere gratitude and wish her only the very best and all the success!\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Veni for any one who is planning for a baby and pregnancy care.  *** ** *** *****",

We had to change doctors in our 5th month of pregnancy and a friend recommended Dr Veni. On our first visit she spent 1hr understanding our case history and interventions so far and patiently answered our myriad of questions. She was always available and responded quickly on whatsapp whenever I had a question. I had GDM and she ensured that we consulted a very good Diabetologist as well. She provided a personal touch all through our journey ensuring we were aware of all the interventions and assuring us that we can do it. She provided very practical advise and ensured we werent stressed about the scans etc. We had an induced labour which unfortunately didnt progress as planned. However she still kept encouraging us to try for a natural delivery. We in the end took a call for a C-sec and were blessed with a baby girl.  Post the surgery, my stitches got infected and Doctor ensured that she did everything to help me get over that infection. Dr Veni demonstrates a high level of responsibility towards you as a patient and really cares for you. She is very resourceful as well.  We are truly thankful for having consulted her to bring the bundle of joy into our lives. ",

I have pcod and found it difficult to get pregnant again..i got ovulation treatment done by Dr veni. The miscarriage was in August 2021 and I got pregnant again in Feb 2022. In between there were many instances where i gave up as i was simply not getting pregnant but she motivated me to keep trying and we would track the ovulation cycles every month. I had about a zillion question and she answers everything clearly and patiently. These days when it is difficult to get a doctor to answer all your questions and they don't spare more than five minutes with you, veni mam is a rarity. Never ever have I left her clinic with any question unanswered till date.  With her treatment and support i finally got pregnant in Feb 2022 and what a beautiful journey it has been. Having a wonderful gynecologist can make all the difference. For the first three months i was literally paranoid due to the previous miscarriage experience. Veni mam never shot down any question, no query however silly went unanswered. No emergency went unattended.My pregnancy was a beautiful journey solely because she was my doctor. In September veni mam helped deliver my healthy baby girl. From ovulation induction process, lot of disappointment due to not getting pregnant again, the trauma from the first miscarriage.. veni mam has seen and guided me through everything. If not for her, i wouldn't be having my baby girl today. She is the kindest *** *** **** ******** doctor i have met in my life and that kindness and patience makes all the difference.",

In fact she is not like other doctors who at times just rush past. Infact she spent more than an hour for one of my babies to move as I had rushed to her with reduced movement. I had a c section under her and my procedure as well as the recovery was smooth and fast. Her care and compassion doesn't stop just after delivery. She actually kept in touch and kept following up with me till my babies and i were discharged. Dr Veni is a doctor who is very knowledgeable, communicates very well and has a lot of care and compassion towards her patients... Would visit her for all my gynaecological needs Henceforth and also highly recommend Dr. Veni. ",

Very Friendly, listens to all our problems very patiently and clears all our doubts and queries. she is always available over the phone for all our queries and doubts.\nIn my case it took a long time(34 hours) to deliver a baby, she encouraged and  gave confidence in each and every step of labor and had a vaginal delivery.\nGreat quality of medical care. I highly recommend her to all my friends.\nThanks Dr.Veni mam for all your support and guidance through out my journey\ud83d\ude0a.",

Explained even the smallest risks associated and the solutions for the same.She kept on asking if we had any doubts or problems during every visit. I was not sure of having normal  delivery, but doctor kept on encouraging that it is possible. Finally delivered a baby girl normally with doctor around me taking all my tantrums in the labor room. Overall the relationship was like with that of a family than doc- patient relation. Thank you very very much doc. I recommend the doctor to everyone who are looking for a doctor with family type care.",
