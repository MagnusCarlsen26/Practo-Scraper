Throughout the entire pregnancy journey, she was incredibly polite and supportive, always treating my wife like a family member. Her compassionate approach and attentive care made us feel reassured and confident at every stage.\n\nDr. Aparnaa ensured that all checkups were done promptly and prescribed necessary medications when needed. She patiently listened to all our concerns and took the time to explain everything in detail, which we deeply appreciated.\n\nHer clinic is very well managed, and we never felt rushed during our appointments. She provided ample time for each patient, making us feel valued and heard. Additionally, her availability on WhatsApp for any urgent queries was a tremendous support.\n\nThe delivery at Rainbow Hospital was seamless, thanks to Dr. Aparnaa. Her expertise and calm demeanor during the delivery process were truly commendable.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Aparnaa to anyone seeking a gynecologist who combines professionalism with a personal touch. Our journey was made significantly smoother and more enjoyable because of her exceptional care. Thank you, Dr. Aparnaa, for everything!",

From the very beginning of my wife\u2019s pregnancy, Dr. Aparnaa has been a beacon of support, guidance, and care.\n\nConsulting Dr. Aparnaa at her clinic was one of the best decisions we made. Throughout the entire pregnancy journey, she was incredibly polite and supportive, always treating my wife like a family member. Her compassionate approach and attentive care made us feel reassured and confident at every stage.\n\nDr. Aparnaa ensured that all checkups were done promptly and prescribed necessary medications when needed. She patiently listened to all our concerns and took the time to explain everything in detail, which we deeply appreciated.\n\nHer clinic is very well managed, and we never felt rushed during our appointments. She provided ample time for each patient, making us feel valued and heard. Additionally, her availability on WhatsApp for any urgent queries was a tremendous support.\n\nThe delivery at Rainbow Hospital was seamless, thanks to Dr. Aparnaa. Her expertise and calm demeanor during the delivery process were truly commendable.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Aparnaa to anyone seeking a gynecologist who combines professionalism with a personal touch. Our journey was made significantly smoother and more enjoyable because of her exceptional care. Thank you, Dr. Aparnaa, for everything!",

In a time when many doctors prefer to opt for cesarean sections, Dr. Aparna respects and understands patient wishes for normal deliveries. I highly recommend her for any delivery-related issues, especially if you are seeking a normal delivery.",

We didn't even knew what to do next.\n\nWe searched in Google for best Gynecologist near by and then we found Dr. Aparna Panda. On our first meet we felt relaxed after consulting with her , she explained exactly why miscarriage happened and what can be done next. Soon after talking to her, me and my wife felt very relaxed and hopeful.\nShe suggested some medication and asked us to visit after 2 weeks.\n\nAfter 2 weeks,\nMy wife recovered but still she was under depression. We visited her clinic and we consulted what can be done next.\nShe with calm and cool mind replied us not to worry at all and she will guide us from then. We did spend a good amount of time with her and she guided us with a proper and very accurate timeline.\n\nShe advised my wife to undergo medication for hormone imbalance (which caused the miscarriage) after some tests and she gave us a strict timeline of the treatment.\nBut the main challenge was I had to travel abroad for 3months for urgent replace of my colleague.I was tensed because she was alone here and also for the huge loss.\nDr. Aparna Panda made sure and took a great care of my wife during her treatment period during my absence.\n\nMy wife starting feeling good , hopeful and relaxed after every meet with the doctor. She took care of my wife like her own family member. Even though I was not here she treated my wife very well and advised her what to do and what not to do.\n\nBut we had a fear in our mind that it takes long time duration to get conceived after first miscarriage and we didn't knew when we are going to be blessed.\nI returned back and we meet doctor and she said everything is normal now, she waved green signal for planning.\n\nAfter 2months, when we tested it was a different feeling for us. Yes it was good news and we were so happy we couldn't believe.\nWe meet doctor in evening and she also confirmed, that day was the most happiest day of our life.\nDr Aparna Panda treatment really has magical power and the timeline what she gave was perfect.\nShe recommends only necessary tests and medication.\n\nThen She asked my wife to follow some protocols and advised many things to get things very smooth. My wife followed every word of her.\nAfter 6th week,during scan we heard the heart beat of our baby and tears of joy in our eyes. We were so happy we couldn't still believe and then we informed our closed ones.\n\nTimes passed on and everything went very smooth. After nine months of journey we were blessed with a baby boy..through normal delivery.\nDr Aparna Pandas patience during normal delivery is really respectable. She has very good patience.\n\nWe are really very thankful to Dr Aparna Panda for treating us and taking care like member's of her family.\nShe turned our Hope into Real so soon , we didn't even felt that something bad had happened earlier with us.\n\nFor Dr. Aparna Panda from my wife.\n\"Nine months of my pregnancy could have been a nightmare without your medical supervision. Thanks for making my journey to become a mommy nothing less than a dream come true.\"\n\n\nThank you so much Mam,\n\nBishnupriya and Raj Kumar ",

So, we decided to consult her for pregnancy check ups, we were happy about the covid safety measures taken in her clinic.I had my own birth plan like breastfeeding in the 1st one hr, delayed cord clamping and skin to skin. Dr.Aparna agreed to all of it and I was totally satisfied when she mentioned that she practices all of it. So, we convinced our parents to have the delivery in Bangalore itself instead of our native.The pregnancy went on really smooth, did walking, squatting, yoga and was active throughout the pregnancy,ensured not to gain more weight. Doctor also promised 99% for normal delivery inspite of the low water level. She suggested us to admit in Rainbow hospital in my 37th week as the baby was in Cephalic position and 2.9 kgs of weight. I was induced on Jan 25th around 8 pm, I started getting contractions but I did not dilate. Still the doctor in the ward told we will try for normal delivery till 26th Jan 12 noon if the fetal heart rate is stable. From midnight my contractions were intense, but I dilated only 3 cm by 26th Jan around 9.30 AM. Baby was distressed by then, the fetal heart rate was going down.Dr.Aparna suggested us to go for C- section, in less then 10 mins they shifted me to the operation theater. She had a wonderful team in Rainbow children's hospital, Bannerghatta road they swiftly made all the arrangements and I delivered  a boy baby on 26th Jan, 10.19 AM.Baby was distressed, he had mild respiratory issue. He was shifted to NICU immediately, the doctors in the NICU took the necessary care. He was shifted to the ward in 30 hrs and we got discharged on 28th Jan. My sincere thanks to the doctors and the staffs in NICU for the treatment and care provided. Service provided at Rainbow hospital was impressive. Due to covid only my husband was allowed with me and this being our first pregnancy, things went on smooth because of kindness and support of the nurses in the ward throughout our stay.My sincere gratitude to Dr.Aparna for extending her support during my pregnancy and postpartum.  She was always available in watsapp to support. She is extremely professional, *** **** *** ********* *********** ********* ** ***** *** will not panic you at any time. Though things did not go as per my birth plan, she did her best for the healthy mother and baby. Special thanks for recommending Rainbow children's hospital, we were extremely happy about the service provided.",

I had to go through a phase of miscarriage in my first conception and I was very sad and worried thinking what will happen in my  second time conception.When I came to know about Dr.Aparna I decided to meet her in my 2nd month . Though I was hesitant when I met her for the first time because she didn't explain me in detail. But when I went for second visit she explained to me everything about my pregnancy and then on things started to look very nice and smooth.I started to gain trust on her.Suddenly 6th month and onwards my pregnancy had some complications like Gestational diabetes,Cholestasis jaundice,severe itching,my haemoglobin was also very low and on top of these I was overweight. Since I am from medical background I could understand these problems and tried to take care of these as per doctor's guidance.Because of my complications doctor said she will do induced labour on 37th week and try for normal delivery.But until you see your baby out and everything is fine you don't really accept everything what doctor says.I was scared and worried.Finally the day came when I had to undergo induced labour. I got admitted in Rainbow hospital, nurses started to give medicines to induced pain but my pain and dilatation was not progressing as expected till next morning.Then doctor quickly decide to break the water and checked how much i had progressed. After that my pain started to progress. I was coping up with pain by doing gentle breathing exercises. When my pain become high I started getting tired. My doctor had suggested me for epidural but I wasn't ready for it and said i will bear the pain. Being a physiotherapist I was aware of side effects of  epidural and wanted to avoid it. As my pain was progressing further I was becoming very tired and started to think if this continues I will lack with energy and won't be able to deliver normally and then I quickly decided to take epidural. By this time I had dilated only 4cm.\nNow my epidural procedure went very smooth and experienced no pain after that and dilatation was progressing. After that I delivered normally.\nDr.Aparna handled my case very well. I was really amazed by her experience of handling the situation and taking quick decisions. At that moment I really felt blessed to be having my baby under her hands..I cannot thank her enough for what she did for us...I highly recommend Dr.Aparna ma'am especially to those who are looking for normal delivery in Bangalore.\nAfter taking epidural and having painless normal delivery I strongly recommend to take epidural and enjoy painless delivery because I feel it's a blessing for people like us who do not want to take labour pain and still have smooth normal delivery.\nNowadays normal delivery is becoming a rare thing and when we get to know someone have normal delivery we feel very happy. And same happened to me. I am blessed with a baby girl weighing 2.9 kg and all because of ma'am.\nThank you so much ma'am for taking such a good care of my pregnancy..\nThanks a lot.",

Mam had a clear conversation with me regarding my family planning and suggested I should hold on for sometime and get treated for PCOS first so that I can conceive naturally. 6 months of treatment and I was ready to conceive. However, due to personal commitments, I had discontinued medication and consultation for a few months and tried conceiving on my own. After 3 failed attempts,I went back to Aparnaa mam for help. She immediately recognized me and had a hard talk regarding my discontinuity of medication. However, I was determined this time and with mam's help I was able to conceive within a month. My pregnancy journey has been super smooth. I was lucky enough to not have any complications and those 9 months have been the most amazing months of my life so far. I was due on April 29th and the Covid 19 situation was really getting into my nerves. On my end term scan, doctor told me that baby was in a position for normal delivery.But I was so paranoid with the lockdown situation and post recovery stories from my friends about normal delivery that I didn't want to get into any kind of emergency situation and requested mam for a planned c section. Aparnaa mam tried to explain me that every body is different and it's not necessary that I would go through the same things that my friends experienced. She was determined to have my mind set into normal delivery and she assured nothing would go wrong. As fate would have it, my water broke 2 days later , i.e on 4th April and I got admitted to Rainbow hospital immediately. Aparnaa mam visited me in the evening and explained that I had to be induced as I had not gone into labour yet. She was courteous enough to ask me if I want to get induced or go for c section. I opted to follow what she feels is right for me. 15 hours into labour but my baby was in no mood to come out \ud83d\ude0a. Finally had to go for c section at 10am on 5th April and got blessed with a baby boy. Post operation recovery was very quick and it felt like breeze. We are so happy to have our bundle of joy finally *** ******* *** *** **** * ***** ****** ********** *** ******** We thank Mam for being with us and help us make our family complete.

                "review_text": "High Risk Pregnancy \n\nFirst time I met her was Oct 2016. I went to her adamantly wanting a cervical stitch due to a previous los. But she suggested against it and instead advised other non invasive and natural methods during pregnancy. Instead of advising us to just getting preg she asked us to do certain tests to eliminate all possibilities, advising me to fix all my dental problem, losing weight, etc etc. During my entire pregnancy she watched over my diet, my weight , my bp, my fibroids and such other factors like a hawk. She monitored me very very closely. She never ignored even the smallest factor. I knew my preg was a hard one due to my late age, overweight, multiple fibroids, previous los, tendency of G.D, bp, etc. So she put me on strict bed rest and diet. My entire preg I never put on weight, I remained the same thru entire preg. With her guidance and advice I had one of the most normal smooth easy pregnancy ever, I have known young healthy girl to have complications. But I dint have a single issue. Not one complication. She dint only advise us medically, but spoke and counseled us on a personal level. She helped us become more mature, take further responsibility, prepare us financially and most of all she turned us into parents before our baby came. She instilled the feeling of mother and father into us , always ensured we put the pregnancy and the baby first and the highest priority. I had one of the most smoothest delivery. I don\u2019t know when it started and when it ended. Again zero complications. I was walking and resuming all my normal activities the next day. I felt no pain , no issues.  Today we are blessed with a baby and it\u2019s all due to her guidance. I recently met her for follow up, asked her when can we try again, her answer was minimum 2 years. Any other doc would have said anything between 6months to 1year. But she saw my and my newborn\u2019s well being first. It\u2019s like she is allergic to money. I was paranoid during entire preg and kept asking her for some or the other thing which would have earned her a lot of money, but all she did was turn me down. Her only advise was bed rest, food and lifestyle. She is very particular about tests and scans though, to a level where she will call the scan people personally while my scan is getting done. She knew the report before it was printed. She is like an anxious mother. She does not overlook anything. She is blunt, very honest ( may seem rude), extremely ethical , disciplined , highly principled. If you are looking for a doctor who sugar coats and is very diplomatic or will provide you polite customer service, you need to go to a good hotel. Because she is only about the baby, medical and ethics. By the end of my preg she was like my family member. She is on top of all latest medical and technological updates. She does not need to look at your file, does not forget any detail. Is always available for chats on whatsapp. Towards last few weeks of my preg she was more bothered about my reports than her fees. As mine was a HR pregnancy she never bothered me to come multiple times for visits. Her only concern was my baby\u2019s safe delivery. If every doctor in the world is like her than there will no patients. I wish she was my paediatrician,  my dentist, my physiotherapist etc etc etc. Grateful is a small word, Me, my husband and our families are indebted to her forever. \n\n",

Although she may come off as a very strict gynae, but in reality that\u2019s exactly what is needed for a healthy pregnancy. I was at a risk of gestational diabetes and high BP but thanks to her constant vigilance and diet charting, i made it through without any need for medications at any instance for the above while being active throughout my pregnancy (driving to work until 1 week prior to delivery)\n\nShe answered each and every query of mine patiently(even with diagrams), be it originating from myths from family and friends, google-researched scientific data or just silly random thoughts in the head. One very good and convenient thing about Dr. Panda is that she remembers her patients\u2019 history and answers all your questions on whatsapp texts.\n\nLastly i would like to write that had it not been her and her excellent team of practitioners in scrubs at the labour room/OT, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible for me to have a normal vaginal delivery at any cost; given the fact that i had signed a written consent of C-section in case of emergencies. Thank you so much ma\u2019am for this invaluable experience.",

                "review_text": "\nI would like to thank everyone who gave their reviews, which helped me decide to meet Dr. Aparna, when my wife was pregnant with our first child. Having stayed in many cities and having met many doctors for different medical problems, I usually have trust issues when it comes to medical help and it was no different even this time. I have hardly met doctors who actually believe in what they do and unless you are ready to try what they are asking of you, they tell you on your face to seek medical attention elsewhere. I respect these doctors because they take accountability of their patients and are not ready to take any chances with their health conditions. \n\nDr. Aparna was happy to listen to us everytime we met her but was never inclined to make any changes for my wife's diet plan which could allow her to gain more weight. All through the pregnancy period she kept a strict watch on my wife's health and counselled both of us to make the right choices and decisions. I now understand that for a pregnant woman, her gynaecologist is somebody who she can not only open up in confidence and trust with her changes and challenges, but also someone who can create a cushion of comfort should something not go as planned. Our child's delivery happened in one of the most unplanned conditions but Dr. Aparna seemed unfazed and ensured a successful normal delivery, with both my wife and child in perfect health. She was instrumental in getting the facilities and staff ready for the delivery process even before I could fill in the in-patient documentation.\n\nNeedless to say that we were lucky to have had Dr. Aparna as my wife's gynaecologist. She has not only been there for my wife but also for our child. I was not happy with the paediatrician that we met at the hospital and was referred to for further OPD consultations. Dr. Aparna sensed that and recommended us to another child specialist. Our child is 4 months old now and we still continue to meet the same paediatrician and are very happy with his treatment. Not only do we recommend Dr. Aparna to our friends but would recommed her to anybody willing to experience a smooth and successful pregrancy with the best chances of a normal delivery, without any frown or frustration or any agonising moments of distrust. From the multiple reviews, I can understand that she has time and again offered the same experience to many couples like us and we can only be thankful for her support. Thank you very much Dr. Aparna.",

Why I am writing this whole story because when I met SLE Dr. (she is Rheumatologist which is extended form of Orthopedic) and i realized what Dr Aparnaa Panda said to us in 2014 which we have done in 2016 *** *** *********** *** ******** * that time i have  decided when she will be pregnant i will go to her even my wife and other people suggested me some other Dr. Now after pregnancy also it was not easy going for us because my Wife had SLE and in it there are chances of miscarriage was very high that we observed in 1st month itself from there Dr Aparnaa shown fully of expertise and experience and carried out to us in 9th month , she continuously supported us morally , emotionally as a Dr or friend  which is very special in her and i rarely seen in any Dr.,She told me in alone that chances of premature baby is very high which was also told by our SLE and other Dr whom we consult during pregnancy but because of her continuous motivation, treatment, expertise and wonderful nature of caring her patient, we blessed with Healthy baby Girl which is now 23 days old. Thanks Dr you are really proved that still Dr could be treated as Second GOD , the way you handle our case was amazing , the way you care your patient that is also wonderful. I have already wrote so many things still i have lot of things to say about you...Thankyou so much again and again for the Happiness which you have given us for lifetime..",

I take this opportunity to mention our experience with Dr. Aparna panda, so that it shall be useful to others , i can explain this in 3 steps...\n\n1) Choosing right doctor: Finding right doctor is every thing that decides your entire journey, To provide best care to mother and child and we have googled and learned about as many as doctors with in radius of 20km from my place, read every review of doctors, their expertise, experience, behavior of clinic staff, waiting time, followups etc., after analyzing all the information we choose Dr Aparnaa Panda *** *** ******** **** ********* *** **** **** ** ********* she suggests only necessary things nothing else.... no unnecessary medications, no unnecessary tests or scanning..... \n\n2) Choosing Right Hospital: Having coming from other southern state, we planned delivery in our native place, again wanting to give best care and service i have enquired and visited few hospitals in southern states that ensures normal delivery, but none of places gave me confidence to my expectations,,, Then Dr. Aparnaa recommended Rainbow hospital,,,, we visited and enquired about rainbow hospital and having strong belief in Dr. Aparnaa, we choose rainbow hospital....\n\n3) Type and during delivery:  I strongly hope my child birth should occur normally, but having seeing pains of the mother ,couple of hours before delivery , i requested Dr. Aparnaa to take any decision to make the delivery as soon as possible, still she made it smooth NORMAL delivery....\n\nLoads of thanks to Dr. Aparnaa Panda for all the support and guidance....",

I was happy and but equally worried that I never consulted any Doctor before conceiving. So, I decided to lookout for Doctors who can guide me. Needless to mention, \u201cThis was the first experience\u201d\n\nThis is when I accidentally met \u201cDr. Aparna Panda\u201d and, \"the ease at which she treated me and made me comfortable\u201d, I think every women should have this accidental experience.\n\nThroughout the whole pregnancy, she was always there to help and guide me\u2026 You name any technology and she was on \u201cTop of it\u201d. She just told me one thing during the initial stage \u201cVandana, if you not clear on anything, wtsapp me even if it is late..\". ***** ******** **** * **** ********* ** *** *********** *** * ********* ******** *** ******** **** *** ********** **** **********\n\nI was during my 7 month diagnosed with gestational diabetes and had to undergo a lot of test but every time when the results came, I knew why these were required... Over a period of time, Thanks to Dr. Aparna, everything was under control.\nShe makes you feel very comfortable and explain everything in detail. \nOn 18th April, I was worried and tensed when I got admitted but I was confident that I am in safe hands. The last thing that I remember is that I was happy entering and exiting OT of the hospital and the very next day, Dr.Aparna started pushing me to start walking. I was into pain but I know why she said this.. So thanks again!!  \n\n\nNow below message is for ladies who feels their husbands are not ready for babies or don\u2019t like visiting hospitals\u2026 \nTrust me ladies, Dr. Aparna has such a magic that your husband will start loving the whole experience of visiting and talking to Doctors\u2026 There have been times when he is directly discussing few things with Dr. Aparna and used to update me on the next steps\u2026.\nNow, a lot of you might feel that it is natural \u2013 Trust me, It\u2019s not!!! And even if it is, I would still give credit to Dr. Aparna as her nature itself makes everyone comfy.\n\nSo after writing on my entire experience, I would like to say \u201cA BIG THANKYOU\u201d to Dr. Aparna\u2026 If I have a healthy baby, it\u2019s because of \u201cYOU\u201d. You came out of nowhere and offered me \u201cA WORLD OF HAPPINESS\u201d.\nTHANK YOU !!",

SHE IS THE BEST!!\nI truly recommend her to anyone and suggest to just keep the trust on her. Dr.Aparna Panda will make sure mom and baby are safe in the time of pregnancy and are delivered safely. \n\nI first met her in January2013 when I was pregnant with my first baby. I was going through depression because of my father's death and was obese and 32 then, with constant panic attacks. She made me first comfortable and mentally prepared me to accept that I will be fine. She brought the confidence in me that I will be a happy mother and I delivered a beautiful boy in August 3013. \n\n2.5 years later I am again pregnant with my second baby and this time it's much more difficult and complicated. I had an emergency of a slippped miscarriage in the second month and I was actually thinking of not continuing my pregnancy as it's so threatening. To my amazement she made me believe confidently just within a week that I will be able to sail through very well and this time too I will deliver very safely a healthy baby. I also have high BP problems and get stressed very soon. Still Dr. Aparna Panda made sure everything is in control.\n\nIt's now my 7th month and I am eagerly waiting for my due date which is on 1st week of July. I am happy that I have Dr. Aparna Panda beside me and I know I have trusted the right person. \n\nI don't know the definition of a best doctor, but I know that Dr. Aparna Panda has been the best doctor who is a saviour to her patients. They are in safest hands and all they have to do is PUT COMPLETE TRUST IN HER. That's enough and the final experience any patient would have is \"THANK GOD, I WAS HANDLED BY DR. APARNA PANDA\". \n\nSHE HAS BEEN AND IS THE BEST. \n\nI wish her all the best in her career and life full of happiness as she is the cause so many smiles of so many contented and happy mother's.\n\nA loyal &satisfied patient and a great well wisher!!\n\nLakshmi Ravi.\n\n\n",

On my first visit I was anxious and bit worried as this was my first pregnancy but Dr. Aparnaa was kind enough to answer all my doubts. Thereafter I started visiting her regularly. My due date was in 1st week of March but my water broke on 28th January 2022. I was not sure whether really my water broke or was it something else. I visited Dr. Aparnaa for confirmation and she immediately told me to get admitted in Rainbow Hospital Bannerghatta. By the time I reached hospital I was in labour and pain increased as time passed by. Dr. Aparnaa came and visited me in Rainbow Hospital and told me that they won't be doing anything to stop or induce labour. Dr. Aparnaa was in constant touch with duty dr. Enquiring about my health condition. Since the pain became unbearable by 5.30 I went for epidural and I was told that I would be delivering between 8-10pm. After taking epidural at 6pm the pain reduced for an hour and again it started by 7pm. By this time Dr. Aparnaa had come to labour room and set everything for delivery. At 7.41 I delivered baby girl normally. Since my baby was about to be delivered way before it's due date I was scared whether I'll be able to deliver normally or have to understand c-section. But with Dr. Aparnaa's support and hospital staff's help I was able to deliver normally. I would any day recommend Dr. Aparnaa for normal delivery. I am very thankful to Dr. Aparnaa for making my pregnancy journey smooth and memorable.",

I came across Dr Aparnaa Panda, on my first visit to the doctor I felt she had a different approach compared to the others who I visited in the city. Her approach gave me the results I was seeking. Since then I have been consulting Dr Aparnaa Panda and it's been 3 Years from then. The reasons for visiting her each year was different. My recent visit was to confirm my pregnancy. Thereafter, throughout my pregnancy, from Day 1 she has been very cautious and ticked all basic checkpoints to make sure the baby is safe at every milestone until the delivery. She kept a close watch on my monthly follow ups and monitored regularly on my sugar and BP levels to make sure the baby is not at risk at any time. She doesn't take even 1% chance in a high risk situation. Even during my admission to the hospital, she and her staff followed up with me until I was hospitalized and took necessary steps to induce normally. With 16+ hours of inducing and with very little dilation. She took up a decision that's time sensitive and delivered our little bundle of joy in no time. Dr Aparnaa Panda is a very straightforward, hardworking, efficient and approachable doctor. You will get to know these traits when you visit her. And yes, she is strict when you don't follow up her instructions for your own good.\nMy experience with Dr Aparnaa Panda and her staff has been great! They have been nothing less than sincere, upfront and satisfactory at every level. Her approach and solutions towards the problems are very unique. She is a strict observer and follower of how your body responds and treats accordingly. She takes your inputs and feedbacks seriously at all times and answers all your questions. (It's best to get all your questions written on a notepad so that you don forget to ask her). However, She is available on WhatsApp to help answer your questions otherwise.\nWith time and results seen, I would definitely recommend her if you are looking for a good OBGN to help you.",

We chose to visit her as her name top the list on Google even though when you read some of the reviews it might mislead you. We (me and my husband) as individuals always believe in having our own experience than believing in social media reviews which are mostly used to vent out anger but very few people would want to write about the good experiences coz who cares ?! I felt like sharing mine coz this should help someone in determining the right decision. The 9 months of my pregnancy journey with Dr.Aparna has been extremely satisfying. The way she has handled all my queries throughout and explaining complications if any, I can't thank her enough for her care, promptness and honesty. I would specially want to mention one of my crucial and life changing experience with her as a covid  mother who have just delivered a healthy baby boy, for which i have the highest regard for her. I had severe chest infection due to covid during my 35th week of pregnancy and had to be hospitalised in SOS. The way she had handled my case from helping me admitted in emergency to keeping me in priority without even thinking once that shifting me to another top hospital (who has better covid treatment facility than the maternity specialised hospital I was admitted in) in the city of Bengaluru during the last weeks of my pregnancy\u00a0which ideally means is letting your patient go at the end moment, but she chose my health on top priority and advised us on the real time situation. During any emergency she was just a WhatsApp away for my queries. The clinic has super supportive staff, well managed patient queue and all the necessary arrangements an expecting mother would look for. Highly recommend Dr.Aparna and personally would want to stay in touch for any of my future gynec related issues. Best wishes to the team.",

She went through all old reports and explained everything. When I asked doctor if I can go for normal delivery, I was amazed to see how doctor encouraged us and \ngave us believe that she will definitely try for normal delivery first, C-section is 2nd option though I had gestational diabetes. \n\nAs it was my first pregnancy, so me and my husband had lot of doubts. Aparnaa ma'am always answered all queries with lot of patience. She is so friendly in nature and same time she is strict on certain guidelines like; diet, regular walking which is actually good for pregnant mother and baby's health.\n\nDuring covid lockdown, when many clinics are closed, Dr. Aparnaa never stopped looking after her patients. She always told me to keep in touch with her through Whatsapp.\n\nI was nervous thinking how my delivery will be done during lockdown. But Doctor gave us relief and trust that she will be always there to take care of her patients whether it is lockdown or not. Even if pregnant mother becomes covid positive, she will never leave her patients. This is best thing you can hear from a doctor at this situation and I will be always grateful to Aparnaa Ma'am for that.\n\nI will highly recommend Dr. Aparnaa to everyone whether you are planning for normal delivery or c-section delivery or any maternity related problem. Once you visit her, you will not regret your decision.",

Initial days of the lock down, I had to convince our staff to come to the clinic. They we so scared and the police used to harress them on the way. We had to keep our board light off and some other anxious patients in Ranka colony used to come and ask us every alternate day whether we were open or not. In that period, your wife had come to me in a very anxious state due to her previous bad experience and I am vey happy to provide the best of support during the pandemic. It was my duty to provide online support during unfortunate event of covid striking your family members.\nWe take great pride in being available during the lock down of the  pandemic and giving quality service while maintaining social distancing, ensuring all wear masks and use hand sanitisers at our clinic. Thank you so much for the understanding and cooperation that your family maintained. except for the patient, no other family member was allowed inside the chamber, which you understood as a ICMR protocol and had no complains against.\nThanks also for appreciating my efforts to try for natural delivery of all my patients whether days or night. . \nCongratulations on being the father of a healthy baby. Happy Parenting!",

Words are not enough to express our gratitude for Dr Aparnaa Panda.  \n\nWe wanted an initial scan and that too in the lockdown period.  Most of the well known Hospitals and Clinic (including the Doctor whom we visited before lockdown) refused to do a scan. We saw a review on google and visited Dr Aparnaa Clinic . She adhered to all the Corona Specific guidelines in her Clinic and that impressed us. She did the initial scan and has given minimal medicines to start . She explained about the diet importance and some daily exercises to be done and was too soft to my wife while explaining all. No unnecessary tests or medicines prescribed by her in the entire tenure. We faced another  setback during the 35 weeks of pregnancy when we (all family members) got infected to COVID-19. In this tensed situation we talked to  her even at  mid-night (without hesitation) . She suggested us some medicines and some precautionary measures to be taken. She was in regular  touch with me and my wife , taking all daily health updates during our home quarantine. She was always interested  in a normal delivery . After getting admitted to Rainbow on 5th Dec, she tried her best for the normal delivery. Thing got slightly complicated when the baby heart rate went too down and later baby has passed motions. Even under this immense tensed situation , she was calm and confident about the well being of mother and kid. With God's Grace and Dr Aparnaa expertise , we were blessed with a healthy Baby Boy.\n\nThanks a lot again to Dr Aparnaa Panda. :) ",

I have been living in US for more than a decade and I was under the impression that doctors/treatment available in US are best but that is a complete myth. I was having heavy period for past 6-7 months continuously and was getting treated here in US. Doctors in US prescribed me medicine name \u201cProvera\u201d which made my situation really bad and due to that I had so much of loss, my blood count went down to 5 and I had to go through blood transfusion in US. US doctor could never figure out the actual problem and kept giving me high dose of \u201cProvera\u201d. After 6-7 month of going through struggle and almost loosing my life due to so much of blood loss, I decided to take opinion from Doctor in India and that\u2019s where I came in contact with \u201cDr Aparnaa Panda\u201d. She looked at all my US medical reports, explained possible issues. She was worried about the treatment I was getting in US and recommended me to travel to India so that she can look into the problem/solution in right way. After 2 week of my virtual appointment with Dr Aparnaa, I came to India and met her in her clinic. She immediately took action and prescribed many tests to figure out the actual problem. She gave me few medication that I took for 4 days and my bleeding almost stopped. I had surgery done on 6th day by Dr Aparnaa after my bleeding was stopped and the whole process from start to end took 10 days. I am treated 200% for my problem in 10 days by Dr Aparnaa which US doctors could not even figure out in 7 months. She kept her check on me post surgery and gave advices for fast recovery over Whatsapp. I just can\u2019t imagine what situation I would have been if I wouldn\u2019t have contacted Dr Aparnaa. It\u2019s been close to a month and I got my regular period which ended on time without any issues. ** ******* ** ** ************** humble and of motherly nature. She has taken care of me so well that I will be thankful to her all over my life. I recommend her to anyone for gynaec related problem and I am sure she will take care of you. I am going to recommend her to several females in US who are struggling to get treated for similar problem as mine. Thanks so much Dr Aparnaa for taking care of me.",

I will list my experiance.\n1. Waiting time - MAXIMUM 15 mints on an average. Except in rare case that is bcz like us some one need her help,kindness,smile in labour ward.*** *** ********* **** ********* **** *** ********** Along with Yoga and Walking.\n3. Need patients - she needs some time to study your body bcz all medicine will not suite all person its based on individual.my suggestion nothing will happen overnight be patient and have positive thoughts and believe her.\n4. Choosing right hospital. We are very much comfortable with her so we took her suggestion to go with RAINBOW. Because she will take care of delivery because she studied my wife body for past 15 months(9months pregnancy + 6 months). As she knows her which treatments need to give, how to treat my wife also there is bond formed bw my Doctor and my wife.  in this case my wife was comfortable to express her feelings during labour pain.\n5. Delivery - we expected NORMAL delivery. She gave full hope and support along with her team dr - sumitra nurse - subhasini,anita). More than that when delivery time is close by always you can reach to her dont worry about time. She is always ready to hear you even during labour pain. Only HUSBAND is allowed in labour ward so i am telling you.\n\nI strongly recommend DR Aparna Panda for PREGANANCY from starting till you get beautiful baby in your hands.\nBelieve in HER she will take care all things.\n\nTHANKS A LOT mam for all and for our ANGEL.\n\nBy \nSakthi (ananthi)\n*********************\n",

I must tell she is extremely well aware and professional on every front, a bit strict but certainly needed.\nThere was a time in around 6month, when we got really tensed( since we did our non medico reading on internet) after a scan which showed cervix length to be short, but Dr. Aparna made us really confortable and kept things under control by just medication rather than complex procedures to prevent pre-term.\nPost 38 weeks, we went for a routine checkup along final growth scan,when she suggested to get admitted since water level was fluctuating, she did multiple checkup with some interval to come to this conclusion. She was certain and explained us about all the possible scenario's, so that we can make our mind well before rather that wasting time to decide during labour.\nIt was induced labour,so that normal delivery can be attempted.With god's grace my wife's body responded well due to timely decision and effort from Dr.Aparna along with all the staff of the hospital. The wife as well as baby are healthy and fine, and were discharged the next day after all the neccessary checkups and test.\nAll in all it was a wonderful experience with Dr. Aparna Panda.\n\nI am really thankfull to Dr. Aparna for all the effort and guidance.My wife always wanted normal delivery and she made sure to do all possible to fullfill that.\n\n",

She is exceptional and has taken care of like a gem.I can't express enough gratitude for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Aparnaa throughout the pregnancy journey and the challenging NVD. From the very first prenatal visit to the delivery room, Dr. Aparnaa demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to ensuring both mine and my baby's well-being.Dr. Aparnaa'a attentiveness and dedication were evident from the beginning. Regular prenatal check-ups were thorough, and any concerns or questions were met with patience and clear explanations. The doctor's calm and reassuring demeanor helped alleviate anxieties that often accompany pregnancy. No unwanted medicines were prescribed, a healthy diet was suggested by the doctor and I was able to keep the vitals under control along with body weight.What truly set apart was the prompt response during the crucial moments of the delivery. As I got the labour pain, we reached the hospital and informed the doctor, the doctor's ability to reach the hospital in no time, very early in the morning, played a crucial role in ensuring a safe and successful delivery.Throughout the labor process, Dr. Aparnaa maintained a perfect balance of professionalism and empathy. Clear communication and genuine concern for both me and my baby's well-being were evident at every step. The doctor's expertise was evident, and the calm presence provided much-needed reassurance during a crucial situation by which I was able to give birth naturally to a healthy baby boy.The postpartum care was equally exceptional.  Doctor continued to monitor both my recovery and the baby's health, ensuring a smooth transition into motherhood. The consistent follow-up appointments further highlighted the doctor's commitment to their patients' long-term well-being.Dr. Aparnaa is not just a skilled medical professional but a genuine lifesaver. Her dedication, expertise, and timely response were instrumental in making my pregnancy journey and delivery a success. ",

I got to know about her from google reviews and started consulting her from the very first day of suspect of my pregnancy. She is a very professional doctor, neither used any sugar-coated words nor prescribed any unnecessary medication. This has been our 1st pregnancy and being totally unexperienced, she guide us like a friend and supported us with prompt response through whatapp on any minute health related issues. Since I am bit obese with a family history of hypertension, she suggested me to stick to a very controlled diet and following her instruction the entire 9 months had been the most amazing and easy-going experience one can ever think off. I gained very minimal weight during this time and thanks to God, did not suffer from any added complications of gestational diabetics or high blood pressure. Following her guidelines, I must happily admit that I was able to fit into my regular dresses even on the 9th month of pregnancy. Not only about looks, I was able to carry on with my regular chores and office works without any discomfort till the last moment of pregnancy, until the water broke. This happened just the next day of visiting her on my 37th weeks and she too warned me to be prepared as she observed that I have already started to dilate. Although I got admitted to Rainbow hospital just after the water broke, I was not getting pain and she suggested to medically induce labor. Even then the labor processed very slowly and I was hardly getting any contractions. A heartfelt thanks to doctor and the support staff in the hospital as they have been extremely patient and waited for 19 hours to let it happen naturally. Interestingly, towards midnight I felt light contraction and was put on epidural, which soothed my pain. Right after that, again thanking God here, as my baby too held long along with me and that dilation started to progress naturally. Early in the next morning I was fully dilated and doctor proceeded with normal vaginal delivery. Thanks to all the supporting doctors and nurses in the labor room as I couldn't have done it without their push. Within 30-40 mins Aparna maam handed me my bundle of joy and it was such a wonderful feeling to see the body I was nurturing within my body. I would give all credit to her for such a smooth and satisfactory experience of the otherwise know extremely painful process and helping me delivery a healthy boy and support my post process recovery as well.\nFinally, me and my husband are very glad and count ourselves fortunate to have consulted Aparna maam and her supportive team of radiologist, nurses, consultants and receptionist for their prompt and adequate response in time of need. I will always recommend my friends, family and acquaintances to consult her for any Gynae-related problems.\n",

I must tell you will never regret on your decision....I still remember very first day when i meet m'am after seeing her profile on practo two years back.I was having lumps in my breast with mild pain and severe itching during night. By seeing that she had recognised root cause and recommended test and medicine with that it got cured. She is extremely well qualified in her field and passainote towards her profession.In June 2020 I consulted her again online on prato because of the covid, with mensuration issue. She understood problem immediately and refer to do test and scanning. I was digonised with polycystic ovary syndrome . After taking the medicine of 1 month I got conceived and my pregnancy journey had started.I was on complete rest during intial days due to previous health history and Aparnaa mam was to much concerned about my health. She was always available for me during my complete pregnancy. After 4 month of my pregnancy, I was digonised with ICP, it has started with severe itching on palm and foot. When i had communicated this issue to her, she had suggested to do blood test and Lever function test and I was digonised with ICP in pregnancy. She had proscribed to take udiliv and meet lever specialist to take 2nd opinion. Once we meet lever specialist, he had also recommend same medicine whatever mam had been suggested. I want say that she is very confident in her treatment but always wanted to take 2nd opinion with related specialist. When i digonised with ICP mam had been given complete confidence that nothing will happen to you and your baby till 37th week of pregnancy. I was doing blood and lever function test at every 2 to 3 weeks to know the health conditions as recommended by Mam.Finally my journey of pregnancy ended with lots of joy and happiness and i delivered baby boy through LSCS due to breech position of baby. The LSCS process was very smooth and I had started walking from 2nd day onwards. I have recovered completely and both my baby and me are doing well...\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04At last I wanted to say that, She takes care of her patients like her own family members and always available for them.

Once we got the positive pregnancy test then we decided to find the best doctor who can treat and help us through out the pregnancy. I got Aparna's recommendation from one of my friend, so we decided to visit her in the clinic. We consulted the Doctor and honestly she went through my wife's all medical history regarding the pregnancy and gave us enough time. She was very much careful in treating my wife through out the pregnancy. She has given necessary medicines to sustain the pregnancy. My wife went through several pregnancy complications, but she has guided and treated well in all the stages.\n\nShe treat her patient very kindly, but sometimes she gets angry for the patient well being. And this is fair enough to get angry with the patients if they do not listen to doctor advice :)\n\nFinally, when I admitted my wife for the delivery, I was little worried as she was having some complications, but Doctor handles all the process very well and we were blessed with healthy baby boy and healthy mother.\n\nDoctor tried her best for normal delivery, but it was not possible because of complications and we went for C-Section. \n\nOverall, I am very much happy to have a healthy baby and mother  under the supervision and treatment of Doctor Aparna.\n\nThanks Doctor! keep doing great work and bring smiles to many parents :)",

Finally a big thanx and lots of gratitude to Dr Aparna mam and her team,the radiologist of her clinic and all staffs from Aparna Women's clinic..... Selvi,Sindu and all were of great help .....",

I had my own birth plan like breastfeeding in the 1st one hr, delayed cord clamping and skin to skin. Dr.Aparna agreed to all of it and I was totally satisfied when she mentioned that she practices all of it. So, we convinced our parents to have the delivery in Bangalore itself instead of our native.The pregnancy went on really smooth, did walking, squatting, yoga and was active throughout the pregnancy,ensured not to gain more weight. Doctor also promised 99% for normal delivery inspite of the low water level. She suggested us Cloud Nine hospital  (Electricity) for delivery. I started  contractions on Aug 7th around 8.30 pm. We rushed to the hospital around 1.30am, and hospital staff started treatment immediately after reaching the hospital. Dr.Aparna had a wonderful team in Cloud Nine hospital hospital, Electricity..they swiftly made all the arrangements and I delivered a girl baby on 8th Aug, 4.32AM through normal delivery. My sincere thanks to the doctors. Service provided at Cloud Nine hospital was impressive. This being our first pregnancy, things went on smooth because of kindness and support of the nurses in the ward throughout our stay.My sincere gratitude to Dr.Aparna for extending her support during my pregnancy. She was always available in watsapp to support. She is extremely professional and will not panic you at any time. She did her best for the healthy mother and baby. Special thanks for recommending Cloud Nine hospital, we were extremely happy about the service provided.",

She looked at all my previous reports and prescribed necessary tests to figure out  the actual problem and explained possible issues and solution. Her approach and solution towards the problems are very unique. Throughout my pregency she has been very cautious to make sure the baby is safe at every milestone until the delivery. During my journey, I found her very straightforward and approachable , I could contact her anytime whenever needed. I can't thank her enough for her care,promptness and honesty.\n\nThough Dr had suggested us for normal delivery but went through C section due to some emergency. My C section experience was also satisfactory since Dr had done exceptional job and I had started walking on the first day itself. My stitches are also healed within 2 weeks. Thank you mam once again  for your kindness and support. ",

I was vomiting uncontrollably, not able to eat any thing, my condition was getting worse day by day. So I decided to change my gynaecologist and I visited dr. Aparna. The first time I met her, I realised her care and concern for the patient. After seeing my condition she stopped all my medication and suggest me proper diet to control my nausea and diabetes. During my whole pregnancy she support me physically as well as mentally. Whenever I have a problem or  doubt she replied me through messages. She is very attentive, always replies me as soon as possible. My whole journey of pregnancy was very difficult, but she encourages me and gave me mental strength. \nNow I am a mother of daughter, thanks to dr. Aparna. She is an angel to me.\n",

I must say that she has been a revelation for us. When we first got an inkling that our little one was on the way, the usual fears and distress about finding the right doctor surfaced. The first trimester is also fraught with issues which reflected in us being a bit anxious. But when we met her, all our fears were dispelled. She is caring and compassionate. She patiently listened to all our questions, issues and general queries and clarified them one-by-one patiently and diligently and with a great aplomb. She dispelled a lot of myths that one generally hears from others. She kept us at ease and ensured that we always left the clinic smiling and relieved. She also went out-of-the way to ensure that a couple of other doctors at Marathahalli were informed that we may be meeting them in case of something cropping up. And the best part is that she is available 24/7 on phone and chat. The moment we post a query she replies within a jiffy. We look forward to being in her safe hands till our little one emerges into the world. For anyone looking for a good gynecologist/doctor to place your trust in \u2013 look no further.",

We consulted with dr aparna after reading positive reviews about her and her preference for normal delivery as my first delivery was normal.We were happy with the consultation throughout my pregnancy, covid measures taken in her clinic,also diet advice given by her. She was also available on whatsapp whenever we had any doubts. During my 36th week I was tested covid positive which gave us a scare regarding baby\u2019s health. Dr Aparna assured it wont affect the baby but as a precaution she insisted to induce labour once I get a negative covid test report .Finally on 25th july I was admitted to rainbow hospital and my baby was born the same night through normal delivery.Even after delivery doctor visited me in the ward throughout my stay there and on the day of my discharge when she had to go out of town on an emergency she paid me a visit early in the morning around 530-6 am to check up on me.I highly recommend Dr Aparna panda for any OB consultation.",

Dr. Helped and guided us to control every aspect of the pregnancy physically and mentally. It was really a roller coaster experience, with a mixed bag of strictness and caring nature of Dr, Aparnaa, which really helped and motivated us to tailor our lifestyle, foods, exercises and hospital choices for the final delivery. I was overweight, and it was really a challenging decision for us as most of the Docs said that we can't be able proceed with a baby until we loose at 20Kg of weight. \nDr. gave us a right level of confidence till the labor bed and delivery of a healthy baby. \n\nWe are really grateful to Dr. Aparnaa and staffs who all supported us through out this journey and we would recommend aspirant parents to trust the clinic and doctor, follow each words and suggestions of the Dr. Finally, we just wanted to assure you that you are in a good hands if you are with Dr, Aparnaa. \n",

This platform helped to select the best doctor out of numerous doctors available in Electronics City (I am staying in Electronics City, so was looking for options in Electronics City only). \n  My experience with her from the first day was full of happy moments.Every medicine, every scan and every test recommended by her was very useful. I never felt uneasy throughout  my pregnancy . I had symptoms of pre term labor at the beginning of 7th month of pregnancy but she helped me to retain my pregnancy till full term through her medications . After 37 weeks, I had no baby movement feeling and hence she asked to deliver the baby immediately.Finally I got a healthy and cute baby resembling me. Thanks to Dr Aparna for making my journey a pleasant one . She tolerated my tantrums as I was not cooperating at the time of delivery. \nI delivered at Rainbow Hospital Banner ghatta. It had all the excellent and pampering facilities . My 4 day stay at Rainbow Hospital was enriching.\nOverall, thanks to Practo, Dr Aparna, and staff of Rainbow for giving me an enriching experience.",

However I got conceived again within 4 months after the surgery. I was very scared and confused as there was no adequate time for me to recover mentally and physically from my previous experience and I was diabetic at that time. We again consulted Dr. Aparna panda . The kind of support doctor has given us is unbelievable, all my fear was taken away. Doctor was mindful of my situation. She was always there for us through this entire pandemic, and finally we were blessed with a baby girl previous month. It feels so blessed to have a doctor who understands your problems, taking control of all the situations, treating you accordingly. Without any doubt Doctor,  you have brought all the happiness back to our home and we will be forever great full for your service. ",

She is always responding over phone without any time constraint. During labor pain she responded our whats up message early morning 05:00 AM and helped us and given instruction until ambulance arrived. Aparna mem had kept us positive until my wife delivered baby through NVD.\nbefore delivery we were in tension how we are going to handle everything alone but she helped us in each and every aspect. In Rainbow hospital also, she used visit us twice in day and spent few minutes with and guided with right Approaches to get well soon and also inquired Medical staff with Dose and way of taking medicine every time.\nSpecial Thank you Aparna mem without your expert guidance this would not as easy as it happened.\n",

When I had to go through a C-section she gave me confidence and support and relived me from all my fears, she came to my room and made sure I get up and walk and am able to do my daily routine without any difficulty before she left for the day (on the day of my surgery), now that's dedication, I don't know how many doctors have that personal touch. Today after a month, I am very happy and healthy with my newborn baby girl and I am able to care for her on my own, my wound has healed well. I feel blessed to have been under the care of Dr.Aparnaa Panda. She is a doctor who truly understands her patients needs and knows what she is doing, she doesn't do anything that is unnecessary.

But doctor assured me that it is a small and common problem these days and said it will be cured in no time. I started taking the medicine and i got pregnant after 2 months. Thanks to doctor, now my son is 6 years old. For my second pregnancy, without any doubt i went to Dr Aparna again as she had gained my confidence 100%.This time i had PCOD and Thyroid  issue. Now my 7th month is going on and i trust her blindly. She gives her phone number to her patients and will respond immediately to any query you ask\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Aparna because she diagnoses the problem immediately and you can see the result within no time.  Dr Aparna explains everything clearly and she is ready to repeat it n number of times as it is very important to follow the dates and figures in pregnancy. She is very friendly and treats you like a family member. The love and assurance which she gives will cure half of the problems.\nLooking forward to deliver my second baby safe and sound.",

Consulted for my whole pregency and delivered a healthy baby boy through c session (Tried for normal delivery but due to my weight and gestational diabetes I failed) in rainbow hospital.

I was overweight and had history of miscarriage, High blood pressure and PCOS but my journey was smooth because of mam. I followed her instructions and it controlled with only diet. She always tries to give less medications and unnecessary tests.Found gestational diabetes in 7 months but it controlled with only diet, did not take any medication. Strongly recommending aaparna mam's clinic. Specially thanks to her clinic staffs they are very friendly and co-operative. Mam responded my late night ( 2.00 am) queries too. She took care of me till my delivery. Thank you for all your love support and care.",

We did not want to go elsewhere because of the fact that Dr Aparna was straight forward on the approach. The surgery was also performed by the doctor with very good care and we were visited by the doctor frequently before and post surgery also. Very happy with the service and the way doctor interacts with patients.I've seen lot of mixed reviews given to this doc for unwanted tests/medicine etc but i being in the field understand the importance of tests to diagnose the issue correctly and for the cure. Don't blindly trust negative reviews, i would suggest visit this doctor first. ",

But in my pregnancy, Dr. Aparna Panda ma\u2019am made sure that nutrition is given naturally, not with medicines. I\u2019m really glad about that. \n\nDr.Aparnaa Panda ma\u2019am encouraged me for the normal delivery and helped me with the exercises which needs to be done in order to have a normal delivery.

Doc advised me convenient diet to avoid putting on extra calories. She never prescribed unwanted medicines. Due to some medical emergency, I had to undergo a c section at 38th week. Doc calmly explained the need of emergency c section and risks of vaginal delivery in such a case. Though I was taken aback aftr getting to know emergency c section but doc really handled the situation well. Doc was so supportive and encouraging during the procedure and post delivery. She used to visit me daily during my stay at the hospital. Doc encouraged me to start walking for speedy recovery, feed my baby on egular intervals and slowly return to my normal routine. Doc was upset more than I was for undergoing c section as my first delivery was normal delivery and doc expected the second one also to be normal.Doc is always available at calls and wats app to answer ones's queries.Doc is a gem and I highly recommend this doc.",

We were planning to start a family but I had some issues with my cycles and thyroid also. I am 34 years old. We had consulted some other Doctors but had not felt comfortable with the process. We met doctor Panda after going through online reviews and were never disappointed. She appears strict but has clear diagnosis of the issues, tells things to you as it is and aims to put you on the right direction immediately. She helped us conceive even with my history of menstrual disorder and thyroid issue and that too without any IVF treatment. She prescribes necessary interventions and medications only. In the 4th month of my pregnancy she noticed I had a short cervix and immediately advised us to go for cervical cerclage to minimise any risk to my pregnancy. Although she placed me on complete bed rest since the 4th month of my pregnancy she always kept my spirit high and infact her monitoring helped me lose weight during pregnancy negating many risk factors. I am happy' to say I had an absolutely healthy pregnancy all thanks to Dr Panda who took all the right decisions throughout my pregnancy. We were blessed with a baby girl few days back with normal delivery and we owe it to Dr Panda. We have never seen such a dedicated doctor with so much passion towards her job. Thanks a ton ma'am. ",

Without any delay we fixed an appointment and in our first visit my wife went through some blood tests and USG scan and we came to know that she had PCOS. So mam diagnosed it prescribed some medicines to take and advised to perform some regular exercise and walking. To our surprise, you won't believe when we visited for the next time after 30 days, we visited with the positive news that my wife got conceived! Thanks a lot Mam for appearing as an angel in our life and  make it possible in such a short duration! The diagnosis process that is perform by Dr Aparna Panda very precise, she described very well what is the cause of the problem and obviously result of the treatment is awesome! We are going through regular check-up during this pregnancy phase and it is going fine. Everything blood tests, USG are performed under the same hood. We are really grateful to Dr. Aparna and all the staffs who supported us through out this journey. So if anyone facing any issue related to pregnancy(gyne issue), definitely I will recommend to have a visit.",

Doctor understands all our problems and needs, listens patiently and explains all aspects.  She is straight forward, to the point and very affectionate.  You can ask her whatever doubts you have though it may be very silly, she always answers those gently. After few visits we generated a family type connection.\n\nThe entire pregnancy and delivery period we were alone in the city with no family support due to the ongoing covid pandemic. Mam supported us both by health and mentally like a family member. During delivery hospitalisation she made sure that our tenure at hospital is smooth and post delivery she followed up from her side to make sure I am doing good which hardly any doctor does.\n\nWhenever I am concerned or was nervous on Hospital bed, she was there and trust me when I see her I gain more confidence  and feel energetic. Thank you Mam for being there during all these tough times and for taking good care of me. Your contribution in our lives, we will always cherish.\n\nFor aspirant parents we will suggest, just trust Mam, follow her each words and forget everything else. You are in very good hands and she will make sure for the best result.",

Have been consulting her from the time we found out about my pregnancy. She has been an excellent guide and doctor from the start of the pregnancy till the delivery. Never prescribed any unnecessary medications/ blood tests or scans. Always spoke to the point and never scared us with any negativity . Was always positive. Got the delivery done at Rainbow Hospitals Bangalore. She made sure that she herself came in to do the delivery no matter the time. She pushed me to go for a normal delivery and I myself asked her to do a C section. The entire team of doctors and sisters at Rainbow hospital have been completely supportive. They motivated me and finally made up my mind to go for normal delivery with Epidural. Epidural really helped. Special thanks to Dr Aparna for making our dream come true and being there for us throughout. God bless :) \nWe definitely recommend Dr Aparna and Rainbow hospitals . It was an amazing experience throughout \ud83d\ude0a",

Didn't knew the cause, just thought of some hormonal imbalance due to my hectic job.\nFirst day itself she suspected something wrong and ordered few test. To my surprise I was pregnant, but my happiness didn't last long as it turned out to be ectopic pregnancy. The way she handled my case is truly amazing. When I myself was not aware of the intensity of the word \"ectopic\", she literally saved my life.\n\nMe and my husband were worried to try next time, but after her reassurance we gave it a try and conceived within 2 months. And now after a year of meeting her, I am with my little angel in June 2021.\nMy entire journey went smooth with her. She focuses on health, diet busting all conventional myths, resulting in no complications, and a normal delivery. \nShe is always responsive, gives timely support and very well knows about what she is doing. ** *********** ***** ** ********** \n\nI highly recommend her if you are planning your pregnancy in banglore.",

She was more of like a elder sister who guided us well with her knowledge and experience that she has gained in years. As I was little overweight she was strict with my diet ,amount of rest to be taken. Her medication was accurate and she has asked to take only necessary test and scan. Here I would like to quote ..\"Becos she was strict with me, my total weight gain was 9kg and I was able to deliver healthy babies without any complications and I would say please follow whatever she says that too blindly and believe me you will be thanking her as I am doing right now.\" During my complete pregnancy she was calm and was always available to answer my queries .Her explanation regarding my queries were scientific and  logical.  About her clinic ,it was well sanitised ,social distancing was maintained.She was always on WhatsApp to answer my queries and on call as well. I would high recommend Dr Aparna for your complete pregnancy time,as I have consulted many gynaecologist ** ***** *** ** *** **** *Thank u mam for making us parents of two twin girls and making my pregnancy journey smooth.",

I was diagnosed with diabetes during my first pregnancy which had to be terminated after 15 weeks due to high blood sugars.\n\nWith such a diabetic condition, getting pregnant and delivering a child was a dream for us. I was over weight too. It was only Dr. Aparnaa Panda who insisted me to continue my pregnancy the second time and I am very happy that I trusted her. The results are in front of me today.\n\nSince day one, she helped me maintain my sugars and manage my weight and gave me positive vibes to stay calm and relaxed. I might have irritated her with my doubts, but she never lost her patience and responded to me with a happy and cheerful face.\n\nI think she is the first doctor I have seen, who cares and responds to each patient on what's app and guided further. Many doctors suggested me not to conceive until I lose weight and bring down my sugars. But only she supported me through out my pregnancy to continue.\n\nI suggest and highly recommend her to every women out there who have been struggling with their health issues or have problems being parents. Trust me, once u visit her, u will never regret your decision",

Friendly nature of the staff members made us feel like we chose the right hospital. After meeting the doctor, her kind words added more confidence to handle the initial stages of pregnancy at ease. Her prescription of minimal tablets made us pass through all the stages of pregnancy with confidence. Easy appointment bookings and punctual consultations with the doctor made us feel relaxed all through the pregnancy.  Her words always encouraged and added courage to do all my day to day works as usual with the baby in the womb. Her amiable nature made us feel free to clarify all the doubts that I had on diet, exercise, and everything regarding pregnancy. She used to connect with us personally and give suggestions on fully understanding us and prescribe medicines based upon our own need. We heart fully thank her for all the support she provided.",

I did some research via internet to identify the best doctor in the city. As a result, I decided to visit Dr Aparnaa Panda, who to my luck turned out to be a super doctor, a great advisor, mentor and above all acted as a guardian, which I needed most in the city completely new to me. The very first interaction with her was enough for me to continue consultation with her. Throughout the pregnancy period, I kept visiting her clinic i.e. Aparnaa Women's Clinic which I found to be a single stop solution for all pregnancy related issues. Staffs thereof were quite polite, amicable and helpful. Dr Panda was always there (24*7) for any queries and doubts. She provided a very personal care throughout. Each conversation with Dr Panda freed me from stresses and the whole experience became joyful. Everything went smoothly. I am blessed with a baby through normal delivery. Extremely thankful to Dr Panda!! ",

Just 3 days before my due date I got labor pain at home. I dropped her a msg in the midnight and she promptly responded the very next morning and I was in hospital.

Before being pregnant, I had severe back pain but thanks to doctor that my pregnancy had been smooth due to her medications. *** ***** ********** ******** ***** ** ************She never encourage you to see the bad side of things if you face any problem during pregnancy nor provide unnecessary information to make you panic. She is upfront and sometimes I felt difficult to talk to her. However, you need to understand that she had to work day & night to serve you and you should be patient with her sometimes.l am very thankful to her to be available for me during this pandemic & gave us the best gift of our life.

She explains to us all medical aspects to get normal delivery even fluid level is low and suggested some medication. After three weeks of consultation with her fluid level get increased but the baby growth was still down and till the time 37 weeks got completed, so she suggested to deliver baby in 38-week it-self due to baby growth concern. \nWe decided to go with her suggestion. Now we have a healthy baby girl by normal delivery.\nShe is a highly professional gynecologist and gives enough time to each patient. She is very friendly and makes the patient comfortable so that the patient can explain his/her problems. We are very thankful to her and will always recommend her to others. In one word I can say Dr. Aparnaa is a specialist in high-risk pregnancy.",

Whenever required she is been available on WhatsApp. Today I am blessed with a baby boy through normal delivery on 7th. She made my journey very smooth and positive. Right from the beginning she kept her consultations short crisp and clear and always encouraged me to stay positive and Happy. I am a working woman and she always encouraged me to work till the end which I did . I chose rainbow based on her advice and she ensured she was available throughout during my delivery which happened late night. She is experienced, approachable, prefers and tries her best for normal delivery even in complicated situations, doesn't prescribe unnecessary medications and always encourages you to be positive and stay happy which is very much required. Work on her advises if you want to have normal delivery and smooth pregnancy. I would recommend her to everyone who are looking for one of the best doctors during their pregnancy as it is very difficult to find someone so professional experienced and friendly doctor like her. I and my family are very thankful to her for her extended support.",

We thought we will just consult and see else we will change.But when we met her first time we decided we will stick to her and we never went for a second opinion. Her confidence in her field\u00a0and\u00a0attitude tells it all. I had 1 early miscarriage before and that doctor missed something really important, but Dr Aparna without even complaining or telling bad about that doctor treated with the right attitude.\u00a0When we\u00a0visited\u00a0her\u00a0we\u00a0were trying from couple of\u00a0months\u00a0but\u00a0was unsuccessful, with her guidance I conceived within 3 weeks of my visit.She knows when to be strict and when to be soft with her patients. At times I used to feel she is being very strict but ultimately it was for my benefit only. She always tries to minimize patient's expenses on visits and reports unlike other doctors, in my case she reduced hospital stay also by 2 days. She was available 24*7 for any kind of doubts in these 9 months. She has been very cooperative.I would recommend her to all my family & friends who ever plans to be mommy or any other gynac issues.\u00a0Thanks Doctor for everything during this 9 month of pregnancy!\u00a0I gave birth to a baby girl this week.",

The fact that Care Diagnostics has all the necessary scanning and blood/urine test arrangements at the clinic makes it even more easier to deal with the process. *** ** ******** *** **** ***** ** ********** **** **** *** she is affiliated with the Rainbow Hospital in Bannerghatta road which is top notch and which is where we had our baby delivered. Ours was a little complicated case since around 34th week the baby position had lowered. Dr. Aparna adviced us to follow strict bed rest because she was determined to avoid preterm labour and ensure that the baby atleast stay in the woumb till the 37-40 weeks. However due to some complications the mother experienced a sudden placenta rupture due to which we had to go for a c-section as a final measure. Dr. Aparna was available in the Rainbow hospital at very short notice and the surgery was performed at 5 am.  Both baby and mother are doing well :) We are very thankful for Dr. Aparna and her entire staff at Care Diagnostics  as well all to all the support staff and doctors at the Rainbow hospital for the necessary help, precaution and support to have a succesful and healthy pregnancy!

My wife had vomited twice during a day and after vomiting she felt something is stuck in her throat. We immediately went to Rainbow but the duty doctor after consultation with our regular doctor told to visit any ENT. This was really a bad experience and then luckily we saw Dr. Aparna Panda's clinic just opposite to our apartment and we visited her for the first time. She said that its very normal in pregnancy and she told its because of acid reflux. She gave medicine and my wife was fine in a span of few hours. Later during our entire treatment she guided us properly. At the end of due date since my wife didn't get the pain she told us to go for induced pain and then at the end of an eventful night on 14th May early morning we had a normal delivery. This became possible only because of encouragement of doctor and strong belief that normal delivery is possible although heart beat of baby was dipping sometimes.\nWe would strongly recommend Dr. Aparna Panda.\nNitesh Kumar\nSurya Devarajan\n",

She also monitors the quality of her clinic's service and takes feedback routinely, even ensuring staff take utmost care - shows how much importance she places for the patient and family experience. Her expertise and instinct is great - timely advice and decision making helped me deliver my baby within just seven hours of admission and through an NVD. She instilled confidence, showed tremendous compassion, and got the care team to work like a well-oiled machine - this was what got me through the experience. She even supported for feeding and postpartum advice, and checked on us during the recovery routinely during her busy schedule. ***** *** ** *** **** ******* **** **** **** *** ** highly recommended for anyone who wants to go through a safe pregnancy and delivery, with minimal intervention and the best outcomes for them!",

She has been our go-to Gynecologist in Bangalore and we have been visiting her Clinic since June last year. \n\nWe were planning for a baby since the start of 2017, then it came to light that my wife has the Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  We tried homeopathy and Ayurveda treatments at our hometown, but the situation did not improve. \n\nMy wife was on medications suggested by Dr Aparna since June 2017. This year starting January, Doctor recommended IUIs to help speed up the process, as my wife's ovulation was not consistent. Dr. Aparna checked all the options before recommending IUIs, and we are thankful to Dr. Aparna that my wife was able to conceive in Februrary this year. Now we are at the 26th week of pregnancy, and do visit Aparna clinic on a monthly basis for checkups. This is a very exciting time for us, all thanks to Dr. Aparna and her diligent treatment process that made us believe that PCOS is also a solvable problem. \n\nThank you Doctor for all the care at your clinic.\n\nKind Regards,\nAbhilash Nair",

We had  plans of delivering the baby in our home town  or else we would have consulted her right in the beginning of my pregnancy. Consulting Dr Aparna Panda was a wise decision. She won us over then and there by not only patiently listening to us but also by not prescribing any unnecessary tests. Anyone who has been through that phase would understand how mentally challenging those times can be and having a doctor who is comforting and at the same time honest with you is the best thing that can happen to you. Dr Aparna has always listened to us patiently and ensured that all our questions are answered. In case of any emergency, she was always available even on Whatsapp. The best thing we liked about her was that she made it a point to never scare us, no matter the situation. She gave us quite a few tips to ensure normal delivery.  However, due to certain circumstances, we had to get our baby delivered through C-Sec. She kept me stress free all along while still ensuring that I realized what I needed to do. A very caring attitude and always a smile on her face. I would say she is now as much of a friend to me as she is my doctor. Thanks to her, we had a cute baby boy delivered a couple of weeks back. I would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat.",

It was my second pregnancy after a gap of 7 years and hence I had enough pointers to compare how I was being treated as compared to the previous one.\nShe not only helped me sail through the tenure with loads of confidence, personal care and advice, but also handled all my tantrums with a warm-friendly smile. I was treated as a family, but she was strict when it was needed. The turning point was when I landed in hospital in an emergency C-Section at midnight and refused to go to OT without seeing her face. It was easy for the on-duty staff to put my case on hold by giving me pain killers, but she rushed to the hospital past midnight and operated me. I delivered a healthy little angel at 1:30am and was so very thankful to her. I had heard several cases where emergency on-duty doctors operated at the last moment. I had so much faith and confidence in Aparnaa that I would not move an inch without seeing her face. The moment I saw her with a big broad smile and held her hand just before moving to OT, I knew I was fearless. She handled me like a kid both pre, during and post surgery. A BIG BIG THANK-YOU doctor Aparnaa. You and your gestures will remain forever in my memories and our entire family is grateful to you.",

A little help from Google and after reading through patient reviews & feedbacks posted online, we zeroed down to Dr.Aparnaa's clinic . The location of the clinic is easily accessible for people who stay in areas like BTM Layout, Bilekahalli, Bannerghatta road, Arekere, Hulimavu etc.\nOur feedback based on our interactions at the clinic, as well with Dr.Aparnaa so far...\n-Good ambience and professional front office staff.\n-The doctor is always on time, she makes efforts to lighten up the conversations, replied to all our queries and apprehensions in a simple and effective manner, which we believe significantly helps in building the confidence level of an would be mother. No unnecessary tests and medicines were prescribed and clear-cut advice was provided w.r.t diet and other precautions from the first consultation itself.\n-Scanning facility is also available at the clinic and the doctor herself does the scans, which is definitely a convenience.\n-Reaching out to the doctor hasn't been a hassle so far.\nIt is a leap of faith for us and we are praying everything goes well, we are expecting our first child in March 18'. We hope this review is helpful for people looking out for a reliable Women's clinic.\nThanks,\nSarthak & Sulgna",

Doctor responded to all our query during the consultation and if there any medical emergency doctor was available over the phone anytime ..\n\nAfter conceiving  we were hoping for the normal delivery and also the track record of normal delivery by Aparna doctor was very good .. \n\nDuring the pregency period she took good care by doing regular scanning/blood test  and provided medications based in the reports .\n\nAt the 8th month due to food infection ( Outside junk food) we had severe \nvomitting and doctor suggested for three bottles of drips after which vomitting got reduced.\nAnd during the 9 month after general scanning doctor the stomach of baby was little big .. By doubting it doctor suggested for blood test and in which sugar levels was bit high for normal delivery was quite difficult at that time . \n\nIn the next day had a severe pains and got admitted to Rainbow hospital it was almost night 10:30 duty doctor did a NST and shared the reports to doctor Aparna , the pulse rate of the baby was less than 100 which was difficult for normal delivery and we had a call with Aparna doctor and agreed to keep in observation for some more time there was a severe pain and doctor suggested for Epidural injection for painless delivery and was in a continues observation .\nIt was around 7:30 i think doctor Aparna came for the check and did internal checkup as she observed bleeding and started with the delivery procedures and final it was like a film climax everything was too fast and it was a baby boy with Normal delivery .\n\nSincerily Thanks for my favourite doctor Aparna Panda  and rainbow staff :)",

But you refused because the cost of hospitalisation was 22,000 without blood tests, medicines and consumables and 32,000 including the previously mentioned charges. Please remember that you are talking about a standard and reputed hospital whose charges are fixed and can be clarified at anytime by the billing section whose phone no I had  provided to you  at 11am of 11th Oct 2017, when you had come to my clinic. The cost is not 40,000 to 50,000 as what you have mentioned.\nFor you, her condition was not important, and you wanted to do the procedure in your hometown.  Also, you  took away from my clinic, a very important paper, which I need to submit to the DHO, instead of handing it over to my receptionist.\nI requested you to atleast do all her  baseline blood test done asap so that if she comes as an emergency, providing her the lifesaving procedures will be faster.  \nAt around 5 pm , you called me up and said the she was bleeding and you yourself asked me whether you should come to the clinic or the hospital with your wife.\nIt is then that I asked you , how is her condition and how much is the bleeding? \nWhen you said that the bleeding is more I asked you a few other questions and found out that her condition must be stable, so I said that you can come to hospital so that  immediate lifesaving procedure like starting an IV line can be started. This was at 5pm.\nAgain I called you up at 6 30pm and then again at 7 45 pm  because you reached neither the clinic, nor the hospital till then and kept on saying that you were on the way.\nAt 8pm, U called me yourself and told me , \" Dr Aparnaa, it is done, we have admitted ***********( your wife's name).\"\nI was surprised and I asked how did you get admitted so soon, because just 15 min back, you said you were still on the way.\nThat is when you said that you had got admitted in another hospital which I am also attached to. It is then that I asked you to tell me clearly name of the hospital that you were admitted in.\nPlease remember that I had called you up again and again and asked why you have not reached and how your wife was doing despite me being busy with my patients in my OPD.\nAfter you mention that you have got admitted under some other doctor, it is unethical on  my part to interfere in her treatment.\nIt is then that I requested you to return the important document back into my clinic.\nAnybody who reads this can conclude that while you kept on making me wait for you to come on a rainy day, you were actually bargaining for a reduced rate in a nearby hospital which does not have ICU facilities to take care of your wife as compared to the cost effective hospital which I had suggested you. \nAlso to set the records straight, however busy I am, I am always available on phone for all emergencies and in whatsapp to clear all doubts.\nI dont know what you want to achieve by misinterpreting and omitting many important events in your story.",

On 9th Oct 2017 my wife noticed the spotting as this is normal in some cases we just ignored it and tried to get in touch with Dr. Aparna Panda but couldn't get in touch with her as she was busy, then we consulted our doctor in our home town she helped us out and we didn't visit the clinic of Dr. Panda as my wife didn't want to take the risk of travelling as she was afraid of bleeding more.  When my wife noticed blood spot again on 11th Oct 2017 in the morning she decided to visit Dr. Panda and when she did the scanning Dr. Panda came to the conclusion that the heartbeat of the baby has stopped. This is the same doctor who said everything is fine on 8th Oct 2017. She asked us get admitted in Rainbow Hospital and gave us a list of lab tests and asked us to give the samples at her clinic as it is cost effective as compared to Rainbow Hospital charges. She asked us to get admitted by between 2pm-4pm as we needed time to make arrangements for our elder kid. We have the insurance and to be on a safer side we wanted to know what would be an approximate cost for the abortion, Dr. Panda said that it would be around 40,000 to 50,000. When we were preparing to go to Dr. Panda's clinic my wife started bleeding heavily and we tried to get in touch with the doctor she didn't show any concern and asked to visit Rainbow Hospital directly. That day it was raining very heavily in bangalore and our cab got stuck in front of  Hospital in Dollars Colony. It is in this  Hospital that we got to know that it has been a while since the growth of the baby has stopped *** *** **** ** *** *** **** ********* **** *********** *** when I spoke to Dr. Panda she was more concerned about why did we go to that Hospital and not Rainbow and was also concerned about a document which was supposed to be submitted to her was with us  she was least bothered about her patient's well being. May be our time was bad, this may be a one odd case.\nAnyways my wife is doing fine and we have no complains against anyone. ",

But despite all these complications, I conceived naturally just because of her guidance. When we decided to have a baby, our primary concern was to deliver a baby through NVD. From 1st month of pregnancy until delivery, Aparnaa ma'am guided us throughout each stage. She always welcomed us with a bright smile, which made us feel positive and confident and listened to all our small queries, which we came across. I simply followed her invaluable medical advice and as a result, i had a smooth and healthy pregnancy. She always insisted on eating healthy food rather than taking unwanted medications. Moreover, she always responded to queries whenever needed no matter what the time it is, which is truly appreciated. Under her able guidance, i had a normal delivery. We blessed with a baby boy on 23rd May.\nOn 22nd May, i visited ma'am for my last pregnancy checkup and that day ma'am told us that my amniotic fluid level wasn't sufficient and so the delivery cannot be delayed. We went for RT PCR test immediately since i was told to get admitted to the hospital the moment i received my covid report. But my baby had his own plans. My labor pain started on 22nd May around 1pm after i returned to my home. I reached at the hospital at 6:30pm. The pain got intense around 7pm. Around 12:30am,I was only 7cm dilated. Despite my insufficient amniotic fluid level and excessive bleeding, Aparnaa ma'am tried her best to deliver my baby normally. But my cervix wasn't ready to be dilated more. At last, ma'am Decided to go for C-Section. I was shifted to OT. Ma'am checked my cervix for the last time. And surprisingly, i was fully dilated by then. Ma'am was so happy and she decided to go for vacuum delivery. At last, my baby was delivered through NVD thanks to ma'am. I would like to say thanks to the team of Rainbow Hospital who took care of me and my baby very well.\nIn a nutshell, her calm demeanor, expertise, and experience make her patients feel assured that they are in the safest hands. We are happy and satisfied to have Aparnaa ma'am in our lives because of which my pregnancy ended on a happy note.\n\n",

She is one of the most inspiring and admirable doctor i have ever seen.\n\nIn the seventh month we have visited Dr. Aparna madam (at care diagnostics)and she encouraged,  motivated & given enough confidence for normal delivery. After consulting her, there was no fear of C-Section. She has great commitment and patience.\n\nI am extremely thankful to Dr. Aparna madam for taking right decisions at the right time during labor (40 hours of labor). Day and Night she was available for us  over phone calls, whatsapp and visited when required. No doctor would have waited for such long time in hospital.\n\nAfter getting intense contractions we went to  Rainbow Hospital at night 1:30 A.m (27th march). and Aparna madam suggested to stay in observation room.\nNST test was performed continuously to monitor baby health , even in the Midnight  3 am madam answered calls and given suggestions.\n\nAfter 36 hours of labor, cervix was only 2 cm dilated.   very  less progress in dilation. Duty doctor suggested to go for C-section. We lost hope for normal delivery and in complete disappointment. Dr. Aparna was continuously monitoring , over phone calls with Nurse and duty doctor entire night from 11:30 pm to morning 7 :30 Am.\n\nSuddenly Dr. Aparna came to hospital in the morning time and taken right decision & changed medications which helped for the dilation of cervix from 2cms to 10 cms & delivered baby successfully on March 28th.\n\nExtremely happy with facilities provided by Rainbow hospital(Bannergatta road) & providing best infrastructure.\nBaby health and my wife health were monitored  throughout the labor.",

Then one of my friend suggested consulting ma'am.\nI consulted ma'am and she made us understand the cause in a single consultation and guided us on how to prepare for getting pregnant. \nActually I was diagnosed with LUPUS (SLE) which I got to know after consulting ma'am and she gave me hope and positive energy to conceive naturally without any medicine. With god's grace I got pregnant in a month . Whole pregnancy ma'am gave me proper guidance and ma'am gave positive vibes in each follow up which gave me the positive result. I delivered a baby girl last month. Before consulting ma'am I was not sure whether I will become a mom.

She was quick to point out that diet should be restricted due to Diabetes and also suggested several medicines for High BP and Thyroid issues. Doctor was also patient with our repeated questions on pregnancy related topics. She was also flexible to attend to us in the clinic during the last few weeks before the delivery even though she was unavailable. Finally our baby was delivered by her a week ago and she was present throughout the surgery. We even go to her for post pregnancy issues.Thank you to Selvi as well for our last minute requests to her for change of time/day consultations",

Only because of Aparna Mam's excellence and God's grace, it's normal delivery. Otherwise it could have ended up in the c section. I opted for epidural painless injection under her guidance.

My baby didn't have heartbeat at 7th week and I was so heartbroken as I have had 2 misscarriages in the past, thought I would be loosing this one as well. But doctor assured me that I have strong pregnancy and gave me prenatal vitamins and supporting drugs and asked me to come after 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks at the scan we found little heart beating inside which was so releiving. I had a smooth pregnancy journey under Dr. Aparnaa ma'am guidance. We will be forever grateful to her.",

From the very beginning, she made me feel like I am her younger sister. She listens to you,\nunderstands you and then treats you. I had sugar issue but only on her suggestion, it's under control \nwithout any insulin but only on GDM Safe. Also, I had thyroid and even I used to forgot but she always\nkept on reminding me for the regulation on thyronorm depending on thyroid test results. I am waiting \nto give birth to my first child this month and I never felt like as everything is normal and that's \nalso because of Aparna Di. The best thing about di is that she is always available anytime\nof the day or night either on WhatsApp or call. Just waiting for my baby and will update the review.\nTo summarize, you can trust Aparna more than yourself or any other doctor.",

Initially i was nervous, but she assured me that nothing would go wrong. And now i have this lovely baby girl all because of her. The baby when born was just 1.9 kgs.

She saw my past health reports and asked me to conduct some more health checkups for both me and my husband. post that she gave a detailed analysis and asked me to reduce weight so that conceiving would be easy. In 3-4 months I conceived and blessed with a baby girl. I want to thank Dr Aparnaa for standing by our side and explained each process in detail. I can't thank her enough for encouraging me for the normal delivery as she waited for entire day for that. My family and me will always be grateful for all the happiness in our lives today.",

All through the phase of pregnancy,  she was very friendly in addressing the queries, providing suggestions related to body weight, exercises,  medications etc. At times she used to respond to queries on whatsapp too. My wife's first delivery was cesarean and there is a speculation that second one would be cesarean too, but doctor was pretty confident on the normal delivery and in every visit she used to boost up and never ever spoke about cesarean. At the time of delivery too, my wife couldn't sustain the pains and insisted for C section, still she encouraged to give a try and finally blessed with a cute baby gal on Nov 16, 2021, rare case of VBAC( Vaginal Birth After Cesarean). Thanks would be a small word to convey and the way she responds, treats the patient is really awesome. Truly blessed.",

Her calm approach and encouraging positive words made us look forward to positive outcome. She would never communicate in a negative way that would scare us but always gentle in explaining what precautions need to be taken. She also spoke encouragingly on going for a normal delivery. Throughout the labor she monitored the progress closely and ensured that i had a Normal Delivery. She also supports epidural if you wish to for it. We cant thank Dr Aparnaa enough for her positive words, right treatment and normal delivery support.",

She always encourages natural ways e.g.; food, delivery process etc. She prescribes only bare minimum medicines, tests and makes sure patients do not get cost unnecessarily. We still remember her prescription one day that only had 3-4 types of fruits & veggies and no medicine at all. We are extremely blessed to have her in our pregnancy journey.

I went through a smooth and quick labour and delivered a healthy baby girl through Normal vaginal delivery.\nWith her level of experience and expertise one can fully count on her for the best treatment.

She makes us comfortable throught out the treatment period. I was worried a little because there was a single loop on my baby's neck & but she promised me that she can make it a normal delivery & did the same. A normal delivery is what we rarely hear these days, especially in Bangalore.\nDuring this COVID lockdown period, she was approachable through her WhatsApp & cleared all my doubts.\nThank you so much doctor. I would recommend her for genuine treatment with very good experience.\n",

She was reachable at anytime in her mobile for any emergency problems. I had a threatening abortion in my 4th month of pregnancy but Dr. Aparnaa did not allow that to happen and handled that skillfully. She has not provided me a junk of medications, all medications where of less doss and to the need. There were no unnecessary scans and tests done. She was having patience to answer all my doubts and fears about pregnancy. She has given me mental strength throughout my pregnancy. Unfortunately it was a C-Section to me.",

We went for pre pregnancy check ups for conceiving and from initial visits only she found out underlying problem. She explained the problem and put me on medication and I conceived soon. All the pregnancy visits, delivery and post delivery, we consulted her only. Though we planned for normal delivery but went through c-section due to some emergency.

I must tell you, without Aparnaa mam, the normal dilivery was not possible in the rainbow hospital. Her regular follow up in late night and early morning gave us confidence that everything will go fine.

My labor went on for 34 hours much to my surprise, but Dr Aparnaa made sure I was taken care of throughout the process and had a vaginal delivery. the recovery was smooth as well. The key is to be positive and help your doctor to help you! Thank you doctor for this positive experience!",

She was very supportive to us during our entire journey of pregnancy. Also she was very responsive in answering all our queries on call or watsapp. Since this was my first time, used to scared and panic but mam was very polite in handling everything till the end. She never asked us to get any unnecessary tests and scans done. She  took full care that I should have a normal delivery which did happen and is very rare now a days. I was overweight and mam was strict at times with me regarding my diet , but that was for my own good. I will never forget the way she calmed my anxiety down and spoke to me in the labor room and ensured everything will be alright.  Thank you Dr. Aparnaa Panda for such a wonderful and warm experience!  We would highly recommend her consultation for a going great pregnancy.",

It doesn\u2019t take too long for us to understand what a great doctor she is. Our case is very critical with complications like RH -ve, short cervical length, Gestational diabetes. When I consulted many of my doctor friends from several other locations they all said Normal delivery with such conditions is very unlikely. But she proved them all wrong with her own patented magic hands. Now we are proud parents to a healthy baby. I don\u2019t know how to thank her for her dedication, experience and commitment to ensure such a happy journey especially during these pandemic days. Thanks madam for the wonderful experience and and staying with us throughout this journey.",

She guided us on what and what not to expect clearly through out the tenure. Her upfront attitude might come as a barrier for many in the initial stage,  but she is very supportive, motivative and friendly. I had some initial challenges in my first trimester where she helped me to navigate through without any hiccups. It was a smooth sailing throughout due to her expert guidance and experience.  She is strict & upfront to ensure your as well as your baby's wellbeing.Though we were skeptical till the end about normal delivery, true to her reviews which we read online, I had a normal delivery in September. Thank you Dr Aparna for being a great support throughout my pregnancy and even now after the delivery.I strongly recommend Dr Aparna Panda as a great Gynecologist and a wonderful human being.",

The delivery was at Rainbow. Even though she comes across as a strict doctor, there is that strong inner humanity to get us through the pregnancy phase and have a health baby(with a strong push for normal delivery). There is high-discipline in her clinic, which seems to have been rubbed off on her staff too. They are well trained. Covid restrictions were strictly imposed, with the place being frequented by pregnants. Appreciate that. We were blessed to have come across Dr. Aparna. Highly recommend her, especially for high risk pregnancies",

During the Covid period we were very scared of the different scenarios however Dr Aparna took full responsibility of safe delivery.\n\nShe was very confident and always recommended the normal delivery. Finally I was able to normally deliver my baby by the guidance and belief in Dr Aparnaa at Rainbow Children's Hospital (Bannerghatta). I am grateful to Dr Aparnaa for handling the entire process smoothly and would highly recommend her for any maternity related services.  ",

She encouraged me to go for painless labor through epidural which the delivery process things relatively easier for me in spite of few complications in the last minute.

We tried for a VBAC , she  was with our decision. But because baby developed complications an emergency c sec had to be done for which which came in the wee hours of morning.Post delivery also she was very helpful when I developed some issues. She gave timely consultation and was available all around the clock. Even now when I message her she quickly replies to all my queries. Overall I had a very good experience with doc. We are glad we consulted her. I had my delivery at Rainbow Hospitals Bannerghata which is opposite her clinic which is also a very good hospital for new moms and babies.",

She is explaining the things in very polite way. Her clinic staffs are also helping in nature. If there is no requirement of C-Sec she will never recommend, she always believes normal delivery is natural and best.\n\nAgain am very thankful to Dr. Aparnaa, her entire team and staff's.

We simply followed all her instruction and finally, we got the best results. We changed the delivery from home town to Bangalore only because of her dedication towards patients.\n\nWe are thankful to Dr Aparna panda.\n",

Each patient is different and we have to know your preferences before we proceed.\n\nWe had a discussion for over 20 min. First 10 mins literally the mask kept coming down at the rate of more than 3 times per minute. After I explained to you that we operate on so many patients every day, and it is not safe to wear a mask in the same small consultation room that I am sitting..... without exaggeration, not even once your mask came down for the next 10 minutes. \n\nAfter entire conversation, just before leaving the room, you thanked me for the detailed information. I told you to continue with your previous doctor but you said you wanted to do all checkups in this pregnancy with me only because you stay nearby and your doctor did caesarean for you unnecessarily the first time. I again explained to you that maybe cesarean was required for you the last time because of uncontrolled diabetes and big baby to prevent shoulder dystocia.\n\nThere were no tears in your eyes and your entire story is made up.\n\nThis entire story shows what a difficult person you are. I also don't recommend such a patient to any doctor.\n\nWe are here to help you. But it's not nice to point fingers at us just because you are going through a rough period in your life.",

But with natural ways of controlling BP with food control and bare minimum medicines, we sailed through this journey successfully and delivered my baby normally 2 weeks back. I give the entire credit to Mam for my normal delivery because patients like me have rare chances of normal delivery.  She is a blessing in our life. Trust her when she is strict,  because it's for your own benefit. The staff is also very supportive, helpful and friendly. Thank you so much Aparnaa Ma'am and the entire team at Aparnaa's Women's Clinic Clinic and Rainbow Hospital for this blissful experience.",

She assured us about Normal delivery and suggested the diet to be followed which helped me maintain healthy weight gain. She was available over phone whenever we had some problem. I strictly followed the instructions she gave when I was positive for covid at 36 weeks and took bed rest. We are very thankful for her moral support during that period. After full term 39 weeks, as she assured before, Normal delivery happened.\nWe are happy that we consulted Dr.Aparna. She has expertise in her profession and is dedicated towards her duty. She herself will do the delivery be it any point of time and always available in need. We recommend the doctor 100%. Thank you so much.\n",

Once I met doctor and spoke to her about my worries about having thick hair on my face, she suggested medication that are anti-androgenic. Within 3 months I saw considerable improvement on my face; so many patches had no hair growth at all. I was surprised and so happy with such quick results. Doctor is also readily available on text, especially during these days when it's hard to visit the clinic. It has now been 6 months, and the medication has been working great and being in constant touch with the doctor updating her via phone calls and text messaging has been very convenient and I am overall extremely happy!",

But the doctor I wanted to consult was on 2 weeks leave. So just for initial check-up I searched for some other doctor and through Google reviews found that doctor Aparnaa is good for NVD. After consulting Dr Aparnaa, I never felt like going back to Fortis hospital. I preferred to continue with her until my delivery as she never encouraged any extra medications or extra scannings. During my labor also in between baby's heart beat dropped, but Dr Aparnaa showed patience and tried for NVD only. And finally I had a normal delivery \ud83d\ude03. Dr. Aparnaa kept her words and my decision was right to consult her. Thank you so much Dr. Aparnaa for all the support and making my journey towards motherhood beautiful\ud83d\ude04.",

I had consulted few other doctors earlier but none identified my health issue and I had already struggled for one year by taking different medicines. After consulting Dr. Aparnaa within only 2 months of treatment I was able to conceive and delivered a healthy baby through normal delivery. I highly recommend Dr. Aparnaa she is bit strict and talks to the point. You can completely really on her advice and she will do what is best for you and the child.",

This turned out to be a very good decisions in our lives.Her style of medicine andnand advice is normal, simple but very effective. I can whole heartedly say this because, we are the proof to it. My wife overcame her PCOD condition and gave a normal delivery to a healthy and beautiful baby girl about two months ago. All credit goes to Dr. Aparna and team for her wonderful handholding and touch and that 'yes, you can approach'.Even in the midst of a pandemic, this doctor had her clinic open! That speaks volumes about her and the staff.Thank you so much Dr.Aparna for turning us into happy parents.Lots of love and respect,Mr. and Mrs. Harsha",

Why did you agree for internal scan? How do we force you for scan? Do we tie you up with a rope? Coconut water is known to make bladder full within half an hour. Even my 5th standard grandmother knew that. How come an experienced mother like you doesn't know that much?\nChronic symptoms of endometriosis will show a cyst later on even if not seen in earlier scans. I explained the importance of repeat scan and because you were convinced, you agreed for another scan.",

She doesn't suggests unnecessary tests or anything which is not needed.She is highly professional and straight forward at the same time . She recommends and communicates very clearly for what is actually needed for you. Through out my pregnancy she was treating me like her own child, my entire pregnancy journey was so smooth with no complications. She gave me correct guidance in  every step and with a positive vibe always. Finally only because of her I am blessed with my Baby Girl with Normal Delivery. She let me wait for almost 14 hours after my water breakage and gave me faith that I can deliver normally unlike all other doctors now a days.She did a miracle to me!! I am really heartily thankful to her. I would highly recommend  her always to everyone.",

She listens to all our concerns patiently and clarifies them. She is always available for her patients on whatsapp for any queries. Close to my due date, I had a complication and got admitted to the hospital on a Thursday night, everybody including the duty doctors and nurses thought it would be a c-section, but Dr. Aparnaa came and explained us the situation calmly, didn't hurry for a c-section and waited for normal delivery. Pain was induced and I delivered normally on Friday night. This was possible only because of Dr. Aparnaa.Thanks a lot for your guidance and support mam. :)",

As a first timer I had many doubts and fears which were clarifiedwith lots of patience and as promised everything went well.. the best past is even when I gave up in the last moment stating that I can't undergo normal delivery out of fear and pain she convinced me and waited for almost 25 hours before I gave birth to my little one. It's a great team at Apollo cradle jayanagar I sincerely thank dr.aparna panda, dr.shwetha, sister shobhitha and mahadevamma who handled me with lots of patience and compassion. I wish more and more doctors walk in her path where a woman can leave all fears about normal vaginal delivery because there is nothing greater than natural delivery. I strongly recommend dr.aparna panda for all your concerns with pregnancy and delivery..",

One thing that distinguishes Dr.panda is that she has lots and lots of patience a pretty smile on her face and compassion towards her patients and their families. At times of distress my daughter gave up hopes and asked for c section but dr.panda convinced her and educated her the importance of normal vaginal delivery and now my daughter is a happy mother who gave birth natural delivery.

Also the pre natal classes suggested by her helped me during the delivery.

She does not indulge in small talk, will talk directly - to the point. She personally takes my scans and explains whatever is captured on the screen.

My husband and myself were planning for a baby and I just went to check if my health is okay to proceed with conceiving, as I felt I was overweight. So mam suggested a few blood tests and an ultrasound. After doing so we came to know that I have ovarian cyst and that needs to be treated before we move further. She started the treatment and asked me to improve my lifestyle and reduce some weight. She gave only one medicine. And with her medicine and my changed lifestyle my condition was corrected completely in 5 months. I conceived in August 2020 and was visiting her during my pregnancy and she gave only the necessary medicines. By god's grace I had no complications during my entire pregnancy and we were blessed with a baby girl in May 2021 through normal delivery under mam's supervision at Rainbow Hospital, Bannerghatta Road. She is an expert in her field and is very confident about the treatment that she has provided me. Though she might seem to be strict but I always felt very comfortable with her. We are so thankful to her and I have recommended so many friends of mine to her. ",

Then taking care during serious situations like bleeding, excessive vomiting and gestational diabetes toward the end. I remember my wife experiencing pain during the labour but Mam was available midnight and handled it very vigilantly and mentally supported my wife for having it a normal way. Due to excessive pain and suffering at one moment we felt that the only possible way is to have scissor, but Mam called her colleague doctor and other senior doctors who are experts at providing epidural and also with help of suction pum doctors were able to make a normal delivery possible. Thereafter we were graced with a baby boy, who was first blessed by Aparna mam itself. Aparna mam may look serious and strict sometimes in nature, but she is very friendly and frank from within. She never prescribes unnecessary medicines. Her recommended doctors were also super and helpful. She will help you all through your journey, always keep replying to queries on WhatsApp as well. Towards the end of my journey I am very happy and delighted having my little one beside me. Thanks a lot Aprna Mam. Also great thanks to Care Diagnostic and Rainbow Hospital for their friendly and caring hospitality.",

It was a high risk pregnancy, Covid times and needed utmost care. While God gave us the good news, also ensured we get the  journey thoroughly blessed by the Almighty. That is when Supreme led us to Dr Aparna Panda. We got to know about her from Practo and without a second thought from Practo's review the care started under her guidance. Dr Aparna was not only a physician but a mentor for us with an excellent blend of sincerity, support and guidance. Starting from the phycological preparedness till every minute details of diet, health monitoring was taught to us. She is always approachable over whatsapp be it early morning or late in night. We followed Mam each step and got blessed with a baby after almost 8 years.  My wife continues to get post delivery guidance from Mam. \n\nThank You Very Much Mam. Thank You Practo & Care Diagnostics. Keep Doing the Great Work for many like us :)",

However there were many issues which we faced- 1. Wait time - No need to make any early bookings cz everytime you have to wait for atleast half hour no matter whether it's morning or evening slot2. Doctor reachability - It is difficult to be in direct contact. The only nmbr shared was clinic/ doc's wasp number. I was facing severe gasteric attacks during my second trimester, I used to message her to check on the meds I can take, however there was always delay in her response upto a day. And the response I got was just 1 word - ok. She didn't even ask about my condition, if I am feeling okay or not.3. Pregnancy related - Everything was fine till 5th month, my baby growth was healthy as per Doc. However the moment we shared that we were planning to get the delvry done in our hometown, my pregnancy condition became high risk with hypertension being the reason. Not sure why for first 5 months it was not highlighted but only told when we shared our travel & delivery plansI came to my hometown, visited new gyno, got a good one thankfully who reduced my meds and also told that my pregnancy is normal, no hypertension or anything to worry about. Even my BP was constant and normal till the delivery. ",

The 9 months of pregnancy with Dr Aparnaa is extremely satisfying. Though I was over weight, she always encouraged for normal delivery. She doesn't prescribes any unnecessary scans or tests. She always replied to my queries whenever I messaged her in WhatsApp. I still remember the day I got admitted in hospital. I was not able to tolerate the pain and requested doctor to go for c-section . But she was very confident about the normal delivery and suggested me to go for epidural. I took epidural and my pain reduced a lot. And finally I delivered my baby normally. It was just because of Dr aparnaa ma'am that I had normal delivery. And that is the best thing that had happened to me. I was able to walk and take care of my baby just after 2 hrs of my delivery.Finally I would like to say, trust Dr.Aparnaa ma'am blindly. *** ** *** ***** Sometimes, she might scold but trust me that is for our betterment.",

Before consulting Doctor Aparna Panda we have consulted nearly 8 to 10 other gynecologists. My wife\u2019s age is around 35 years, all three previous deliveries are normal deliveries and all are girls.\nBut after 3rd baby delivery, since 7 years my wife faced lot of issues during pregnancy and got abortions 3 times. We almost decided not to have any more kids. \nOne of my friend suggested to consult Aparna Panda for our problems. We met Doctor Aparna and explained all of our problems. After doctor started medications, within 3 months my wife got pregnant. \nSince previously my wife had got 3 abortions, we had a lot of tension.\nBut doctor gave us lot of confidence, till delivery we got excellent treatment. Doctor Aparna is very co-operative, has lot of patience and clarified all our silly and minor doubts.\nOn 23rd October 2019 we had been blessed with a Baby Boy. This is one of the best moment in our life.\nBefore delivery almost 10 days, every day we have consulted doctor. We got excellent advice from her. During delivery time, doctor took special care and done normal delivery. We don\u2019t have any words to express our thanks to doctor Aparna Panda.\nThank you once again doctor Aparna Panda!!!\n",

I have been suffering from PCOD and several other hormonal issues since my teenage, was always doubtful whether I can become a mother naturally or not. After trying for some 2-3 months we thought off consulting a good gynecologist. After going through all the good reviews and as doctor Panda is available to our nearby my place, booked an appointment with her  during the time of full-fledged lockdown (july).After analysing our report, she gave us three months course of medication and asked us to meet after 3 months. Unfortunately due to our busy schedule and traveling, we couldn't complete the three months medication. But magically I got the good news exactly after 3 months and that time I was travelling to my native place and my return ticket were booked for Bangalore next week,we consulted her through video call she guided us very patiently. Finally I came back to Bangalore safely and met her personally. Now I am totally under her supervision, waiting to see our bundle of joy soon. Doctor Panda listens to all her patients very patiently, when I met a first time personally after conceiving, I was little anxious and asked her lots of questions. She answers to all my questions very patiently. Highly recommended to everyone who are looking for a good gynac for infertility issues.Thank u so much Dr. Panda , we will always be greatful to you.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

On my baby's day of birth when I went to take admission to hospital, Dr. Aparna told me not to worry and be chill. I didn't feel any labor pain at that time so they just gave me medicines for the labor pain and when I was unable to tolerate pain she suggested to take Epidural because pain will be less and really it helped me to take pain during contraction.But during contraction time I told Dr. Aparna and team to go with C-Section but they advised me it's not good for your future so we'll deliver your baby through normal process and finally at evening I delivered my baby. So lots of Thanks to Dr. Aparna and really I am grateful to Mam because now a days most of the doctors are not friendly to patient and it becomes painful for the patient. But Mam is very much understanding and friendly to the patient and it helped me a lot. What can I say more... She made my complex situation to normal. Really no words for her .Thanks a lot Mam.. \u263a\u263a",

I met doctor in 4th month of my 2nd pregnancy when I had to undergo NIPT test which I was very worried about. She explained me about the test results and was so positive about it and asked me to just enjoy my pregnancy phase. \n\nDr suggested least possible medicines and tests. I always wanted a normal delivery as I have a phobia for c section delivery. She told me to do exercises which will help for normal delivery. As the time came for delivery, I was admitted on 6th Dec for labour pain with artificial insemination, doctor showed all the patience and waited to do a NORMAL Vaginal delivery on 7th evening and she visited multiple times in between and gave me assurance that baby will arrive normally and asked me to relax. I really had faith in her. \n\nA big thanks to Dr Aparna Panda with an ever smiling face and positivity, she delivered my second child normally. I recommend her and would always recommend to everyone. ",

We preferred to refer to one of the so called best hospital in Bangalore but it turned out to be a nightmare. There was some complications in the pregnancy and the doctor suggested delivery around wk 27. We were very depressed and tensed thinking about what next if the baby is delivered so early.Browsing Google we found Dr Aparnaa Panda and decided to take a second option about the delivery. The first visit with her was very fruitful and looking at the reports she stated that there is nothing to worry and my wife can carry the pregnancy, the visit certainly gave lot of confidence to us. Over the next few weeks every time we meet her she explained about the current state and what can be done next. 20th Nov we were blessed with a baby boy. Thanks to Dr Aparna.She is very composed, transparent about the situation and very calculative in taking risk during medical conditions. She never suggest unnecessary medicine or tests and always suggest the best possible way so that someone does not ends up spending money .I will suggest every one to refer her for issues.Thank you Dr Aparnaa again for giving the smile to us end of the day. May God bless you ! Soumya/Sudipta Ghosh",

Her medical expertise, love and care have showed the miracle!  My wife has CONCEIVED successfully and doing good.  We are very happy and relaxed now, as we are under the supervision of Aparnaa Ma'm.  She always takes time with patients, answers all our questions and never seem to be in a rush to move on to the next patient. I would highly recommend her to my closest friends and family! Aparnaa Ma'm, Many of your patients have recommended you as a good doctor. But I am going one step further to also to recommend you as a great human being.

It is human for doctors to take leave and if you had clarified with the receptionist, she would not have charged you for the follow-up visit to show the reports after 10 days since I was on leave for a week.\n#3. You visited me because  you were anxious to conceive and not because you wanted a pregnancy consultation.\n#4. You had come late for your appointment and I had a delivery patient waiting for me twelve kilometers away from the diagnostic center I met you. I was displeased with the receptionist for collecting your consulation fees. What should I have done? Returned the fees back to you, not considering the fact that you had come spending your time and energy to pay a visit to me? \n#5. I did see your reports in detail and still you have written that I did not bother to see your reports. I saw that your thyroid was under-corrected and gave you proper medication and diet to correct the same and do a repeat check after 6 weeks which you did not. This you have yourself admitted in the telephonic conversation you had with me two weeks back.\n#6. Your blood reports also showed low fertility values for which I gave you adequate diet, exercise tips and medications. I did not want you to feel low about it and hence did not go into the details of it. Is that what you mean by a cold reply? In that case I promise to myself that next time onward I will not hesitate to call a spade a spade and definitely be more specific. I accept this is a unpardonable mistake from my side.\nPS. I cannot understand why you have written a long anonymous review misrepresenting the facts six months after the incident happened. But I would like to say one thing. We are all humans and small mistakes can happen by everyone. By me, the radiologist, the receptionist, the nurse and even by you. Love and understanding for fellow humans and effective communication can make this world a better place to live in.\nPeace be with you.",

First day- visited in the noon so obviously she was in a hurry to leave but the receptionist had taken the money so it was an obligation to attend the patient. My concerns were heard of and prescribed some tests. Next Day- Terrible experience at the lab, the gown given to me for wearing was stinking. Somehow I wore that. I had gone early in the morning so it looked like the gowns were not even washed for a considerable time. Next was the disposable sheet on the bed. I expected that it would be discarded to my horror the nurse asked me to lie down on the same.After the tests I was informed doctor has gone on a leave and I should come the next week.So again I had to come back and pay a good amount just to get the reports shown.Third Day- Doctor did not bother to have a look at the reports, ****** said take some medicines we will help you concieve. I expected an explanation but I got a cold reply. Anyways not bothered. Did not visit her again. P.S I am not here  to malign anybody's image. I don't need my money back. ***** Neither am I unhappy with my life or weight, height etc etc . So don't want to hear this stuff too cliched and rude. At least create hygienic conditions for the patients, they are paying a good amount and deserve it.",

On consulting, she told me that I had issue (PCOD) and this may not make me conceive without treatment, but she also explained why PCO's is not a big issue these days as it's very common for every 3rd lady, due to lifestyle, food habits etc. she guided me through what lifestyle I must follow to make things easy + suggested some medicines and test and a small diagnostic surgery, to regularize my  period.  \nMost importantly, since she treats you in her own clinic, she takes personal interest in your concerns and address them, unlike doctors in Big hospitals who may not be able to give you a personal attention all throughout. she has lovely staff, who make you feel belonged as well.\nSince she was new to me, i was also checking on my treatment with my aunt, who is a gyno (not in B'lore) as well, and i learn the treatment is exactly same what she would have done had she treated me. \ni have conceived and both me and bby is doing great by far. i would blindly recommend Dr. Aparna for any gynac issues with any Lady. you can just trust her, coz she scolds you like a Mom, guides you like a friend and treats you like a professional. :) :) Thanks Dr. Aparna for all the care you have taken till date !",

I had complications at my third trimester as suddenly I had severe contractions and my cervic length got reduced and becoz of her I could manage and able to stretch my pregnancy from 27th week to 31 weeks and delivered preterm babe boy..but all this while neither I had any confusion or doubt regarding any thing...and my delivery went very smooth without any problem and to my surprise very less pain for what I didnt expect even after C -section done..I have happily recommended my cousin and my friend also to visit her for any kind of ladies issues if they have any and personally will recommend every one if they ask my suggestion..I thank her Soo much from bottom of my heart and wish her all the best in her life and career...\nAparna chandramouli & Balaji rajan",

But as the day progresses, she became so friendly and was explaining everything very nicely.\n\nThough it's not recommended but we used to ask questions in Whatsapp as well. And she was responding in Whatsapp and was clearing our doubts. Sometimes even at nights my wife felt something unusual and we were having no clue whether it is normal or alarming. We used to do Whatsapp and by morning we were getting the reply from Dr. Panda.\n\nClinic is very clean and hygienic. Staffs are very good and polite.\n\nShe gave us choice to decide and do the delivery any hospital of our choice.\nWe decided to do the delivery in Rainbow hospital and Dr. Aparna Panda did the delivery in Rainbow Hospital.\n\nShe was recommending for Normal delivery. But we couldn't wait and decided for CS. We are so happy that she cares so much about patients. She was suggesting to go with the natural process.\n\nAt the time of delivery, she came and had a chat with my parents about the conditions in details. My parents are also very happy.\n\nAt the end we became a complete family and thanks to Dr. Aparna Panda for all her help and support.\nI highly recommend Dr. Aparna Panda.",

The time I first visited  was a stage where I was  that terrible in my pregnancy , she was the one who took me from there on and took care of me like she would have done it  for her family members, I have never felt a doctor feel with her,  as pregnancy is the most important phase of a women life,  a women do really need someone who understands her concerns, I thank god that I was in safe hands with doctor Aparna. Every time when I feel there is no baby movements, I just go and ping her and say my concern as I do with my mom or sister, she would just calm me and give me a confidence and make me stress relived. What else we need I do strongly recommend doctor for *** **** ************ * women can approach during her pregnancy . Now am blessed with a baby girl I would blindly say that it was just because of her.  I never ever say I love you to anyone else apart from my  husband ,but to doctor Aparna panda I would say 1000000times also as she is the one who made her dreams to come true. Even now after my pregnancy she is there to support me.  She is the one who always go extra mile for her patients. ",

We went to Doctor few months before my wife conceived and wanted proper guidance and medication. Its been 10-11 months of best of guidance, a happy wife and a sweet little princess. Dr. Aparnaa has played a role of Dietician, Pediatrician and finally a Gynaecologist all the way.\n\nNOTE: She may scold you at times if you go off track, but that's what parents are supposed to do. \n\nRegarding Amenities: The clinic is right in front of Rainbow Hospital and since we were using Rainbow for our scans it was a perfect pairing. Wait time is never beyond 15-20min. \n\nRegarding Expectation Setting: Doctor is logical here and doesn't over doze you with medicines and scan schedules. The one thing I liked about the doctor was that in 7th month itself she told us that its going to be a C section delivery and not a normal one. This helped me in plan better (not only financials but call relatives accordingly). \n\nThe last visit: Most of the doctors do set grounds for the next delivery on the last consultation day, but what doctor did was to give a diet chart and some advise on exercise and stay healthy.\n\nOverall Rating: if given a chance to rate the doctor: 5/5.\nAmenity: 4.5/5 (too much traffic to tackle)\nReliability: 5/5\n\n",

She makes her patients feel very comfortable. I have consulted her from the day 1 and I feel very lucky to have her as a doctor. She took care of my wife as if she is her own daughter which I liked the most. So would recommend everyone to consult only her during their wife's pregnancy. Believe me you will also go through the same experience which we have went through. I wish Dr Panda all the best for her future endeavors.",

Last week I delivered baby boy under her guidance... Before delivery I was very much scared of pain post delivery but she assured me not to worry and she will take care.. Frankly to tell I dint feel much pain and I was very much comfortable post delivery. Thanks a lot.\n\nShe won't recommend unnecessary test and scans. Scan and blood test facility is available in her clinic due to which we need not go to other diagnostic centre.\nEven she provides extended support through Wassapp and replies to all our queries which really helps a lot.  \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr Aparnaa\n\nThanks Dr Aparnaa for all your support, caring and guidance.",

Which is not at all required for me. and secondly regarding my pregnancy termination the doctor again told that 5000 rs extra for the hospital charges. I don't understand here that just to provide tablets how come they charge in that high amount. I am highly upset because the people who are really get afraid of these hospital charges instead of their health problems..",

She was available anytime on phone for my queries. I was already scared from my relatives that doctors in bangalore are not good, even if it is going to be normal delivery they will go for C-Section for the sake of money. In my case Dr Aparna proved it wrong. I had a normal delivery. I had no symptoms of pain till day before my due date, I told Dr Aparna that I am ok for C-Section also but, she said why do you want to go for C-Section no worries you will have a normal delivery. Then she induced pain and I had normal delivery. Even if I say that now I had normal delivery in a city like bangalore no one believe but its true and its only because of Dr Aparna. I have recomended her many of my friends and neighbours. \"I strnogly recomend\" her for those who read this.",

Each and every patient who  comes to me for early pregnancy checkup is given folic acid tablets and told specifically that it is for baby brain development.\nI firmly tell all my first trimester patients not to eat papaya and pineapple and not to travel in first four months of  pregnancy. Exact reason for the same is also explained to the patient. \nOnly after that i advise them for a early pregnancy scan to check for viability and location of pregnancy.\nIn your case,  ur first visit was on the 30th of June and only after u were convinced with my first consultation, u did ur early pregnancy  scan in a nearby diagnostic center and then again met me on the 3rd with ur early pregnacy scan report.  U were 6 weeks 3 days by dates and also 6 weeks by scan.  It was a viable pregnacy with no subchorionic haemorrhage and hence I said that it was a normal scan report. \nU must have read well online and since the answers to ur questions were yes, i answered yes. I have spent adequate time with u in both ur visits to my clinic. \nI am also in regular touch with my patients over whatsapp and their remaining doubts are answered.\nPerhaps it is unfair on your part to malign my reputation online. \nPlease feel free to come over to my clinic for another explanation of your condition.",

The therapy she suggested was very easy, and course of medicines was minimal. Under her  guidance, all my fears regarding delayed pregnancy vanished. And her supportive nature filled me with self-esteem, and finally.. within a very short span of time, I conceived.. and became a mother of a sweet baby girl. Thats all because of Dr. Aparna's ********* treatment and superb guidance.  Thanks a lot Dr. Aparna.",

Due to her positive, friendly and confident nature, every visit was both uplifting and helpful.\nEven when it came to the timing of delivery she was very decisive, she took an important decision to induce labor at 38 weeks when my BP had started rising and my baby was ready. Thanks to her, I am now a proud mother of a healthy boy delivered normally.\nThank you ma\u2019am for everything. We really are very fortunate to have found you as our gyno.",

I met Dr Aparna the same day, she explained me the medical condition in easy comprehensible manner and all possible treatment options along with their effectiveness and possible side effects. On same night she conducted Cervical Cerclage surgery. After that, I was adviced strict bed rest by her until delivery. She can read her patients apprehensions and addresses them very tactfully.

But with her help i was able to get pregnant in the second month itself since medication. Without any issues i delivered a healthy baby. \nWhen it was time for my second baby, without a doubt i consulted Dr. Aparna. I delivered a baby boy in Rainbow Hospital, Bannerghatta. It was an opted C sec and there was no complications at all. All the Rainbow hospital staffs were very cooperative and supportive during my stay at the hospital. All the facilities were commendable and the room was very clean. \nI woud strongly recomend Dr Aparna as she will be there for you throughout the journey of mother hood. Even if you forget consultation, she wont. She takes care of her patients with 100% commitment",

I had an easy pregnancy and normal delivery under her guidance. \nShe is so experienced, always made my pregnancy journey enjoyable. I used to visit her clinic in BTM, never had to wait for more than 10-15 mins on any appointments. She always replied to all my queries in whats app as well.\n\nOn one of my appointments it so happened that I mistakenly booked video call appointment and realised it only when I reached her clinic. Though she had already left the clinic she was kind enough to come back again and attend me in person. This was post my delivery and since I had an infant she dint want me to take trouble in re-visiting her clinic.\n\nI would like to recommend Dr.Aparna to all ladies for  pregnancy and delivery and any other gynac issues.\nI would always go back to her for my subsequent pregnancy if I plan :)\nThank you so much Dr. Aparna.\n\n",

She even gave us an option of how not to go for the stitch and still manage the issue.\nBut we were very scared and to be on the safer side opted for the stitch.\nAfter the operation, my wife was kept in observation for two days and then sent home. Dr Aparnaa kept in touch with  my wife and via whatsapp. \nNow 2 weeks are over post the cervical stich and my wife is doing very well.\n\nWe thank Dr Aparna for her commitment towards my wife's care.",

Dr. was very cheerful and cleared all doubts. I visited her again in 6 months time and she suggested some checkups. Right at this time, lockdown started. We decided to take it easy for a couple of months and about a year down, decided to go back for checkups. Thankfully, when I went back, my home test had shown a positive and Dr confirmed the same. I knew it was Dr. Aparnaa I was going back to for regular checks from here on. She is very blunt, honest, patient, and no-nonsense. She has also been available for any queries through WhatsApp & thats very reassuring. Fingers crossed for the months ahead.",

Aparnaa mam has stated during this pandemic. And we are  thankful   for her unmatched guidance support to us during my entire journey during pregnancy.the best thing I like is she encouraged us not to visit clinic always and  and reach us on WhatsApp incase of any suggestion .  Her words, \"don't think about the child, that is my tension, just you need to look after you and take the medicine at right time\" really boost confidence in you.not only that  Her  suggestion at the right time , kept me relax during this entire 9 months journey .I highly recommend her . Thank you madam .",

She would be very patient and will advise you in the right direction. \nUnder her treatment I was able to deliver a healthy baby through the NATURAL procedure. It was all due to her patience level with me and also those decisions that the doctor takes at the most crucial points. She took the calculated risk and tried her level best to ensure its a normal delivery. At every moment she was telling me about the progress status in the labor room and also updating my husband about the same. I highly recommend her for the anyone\u2019s pregnancy journey. ",

I especially appreciated this quality of hers, since I had switched to Dr Aparnaa during 7th month of my pregnancy for the very same reasons. Further she doesn't prescribe unnecessary medication, and advises to manage through diet and excercise. \n\nWhile I had a c-sec, the doc and  team at Rainbow tried their level best to induce natural labor (>24hrs after water breaking).  Dr. Aparnaa has a great team of doctors, special mention to Dr. Shruthi who made me feel very safe and calm throughout the labouring period. \n\nPersonally I feel very comfortable with her, and would highly recommend her to anyone. Thank you doctor!",

But Aparna mam was there for me.. explaining everything to me and keeping me calm. The c-sec went so well, that I was able to walk from next day onwards. I could hold my baby and walk and even went downstairs to buy clothes for my baby girl.I am sure everybody wants a normal delivery and I was no different. But with Aparna Mam's expertise, I could say that I had a minimal pain c-sec delivery and very small scar from the operation.thankyou Mam ",

She is straight forward which is her best quality, she treats her patients just like our family doctors do. Our baby got delivered in Rainbow Hospital where Doctor Aparnaa performs delivery for her patients. I will recommend everyone to visit her if they have a doubt which doctor they should go for the treatment.

We searched for the nearest clinic with good reputation and reviews, and we came across Dr. Aparnaa.From day one, it was a great experience consulting with the Doctor. She used to be available even on WhatsApp to answer the questions that I might have missed asking during my visit to clinic. Her guidance throughout out my pregnancy until the delivery day was invaluable. When it comes to delivery, I really have to thank her, because she's the one who convinced me to go with normal delivery until the last minute, in spite of me asking for C-Section out of fear and significantly intense labor pains.Look no further, if you're searching for an amazing OB-GYN. As a Doctor, Dr. Aparnaa earns my highest recommendations.",

Dr Aparna is very nice Doctor, well experienced and listen to our problems very patiently and carefully. I recommend her for all Pregnancy related issues. We interacted with Dr Aparna as my wife was not conciving and had some infertility issues. Dr Aparna has suggested some test for my wife and also she suggested some tests to me to catch the exact reason. She suggested some medicine based on the test results to both of us. She also suggested some daily exercise to my wife . The final outcome is \" my wife is now 7week  pregnant with healthy pregnancy\". I thank Dr Aparna for this kind support. we did FPS recently.Still 7months to go. I need your support to tackle all the problems/issues related to pregnancy..Thanks a lot.",

While she took a lot of precautionary measures to take this pregnancy to term and avoid complications, she never recommended any unwanted test or scan. She was very considerate and friendly throughout and kept pepping us up, citing examples from her experiences. Throughout my pregnancy, she kept encouraging me for a normal delivery. Unfortunately, due to a medical emergency at the last minute, I had to undergo a C-Section, but I'm positive that  Aparnaa ma'am wouldn't do it unless there's a real medical need for it, given the ethical woman that she is! I'd be lying if I say I wasn't disappointed initially, but the fact that she's with you through the period of pain helps in quick healing and normalcy restoration. Just trust her line of treatment 100%, and be rest assured that all will be well.\nI wish Aparnaa ma'am the very best in her personal & professional life!\n\nRegards,\nVaruna",

She shows so much patience to listen and discuss the issues which we have. She also interacted for queries through whatsapp which very less doctors do. Her pleasant behaviour in OT kept me relaxed ( which was done during midnight :) and she came all the way through after the busiest Saturday OPD, n she was so fresh). Hats off to the doctor!! I gave birth to a healthy baby. Thank you so much doc for your support throughout. I would surely recommend everyone to consult her for obg services.",

She also provides extended support through watsapp and replies to all my queries which really helped me a lot. We would like to thank Dr.Aparnaa for her patience in diagnosing my case.

I must say we have been rightfully happy with our decision. The moment you visit her, the first medicine she will probably prescribe is a dose of positivity. Though we were married for more than 2 years, it was around 6-8 months that we were trying to conceive when we decided to consult Dr. Aparnaa. The very next month, my wife tested positive! She has never prescribed unnecessary medicines and tests in our case; of course that will be different from case to case depending on the complexity of the pregnancy. She has always been very friendly and does cheerfully clarify all your doubts. We are in fourth month of our pregnancy, and we fervently believe that next 5 to 6 months will be a great and pleasant association with her. Here is conveying sincere gratitude to Dr. Aparnaa from two young \"to be parents\".",

My wife got admitted with severe vomiting and diarrhea and was found that she was already in labour. Dr.panda was kind enough to wait almost one whole day before my baby was born through normal delivery. Hatts off to her patience.

Please don't judge me based on what you think is right. Rather you should judge me on my honest opinion based on my experience. \nI don't know when and where I have met u since u have chosen to remain anonymous. ",

You had come to me first on 25th Oct 2016 and then continued to come for a few visits to solve  your problem not to mention the countless free consultations I gave you on whatsapp.\nAfter that you also referred Bobby Medhi to me in Mid January. She also came to me for a few checkups while you chaproned her not to mention some 20 free consultations on whatsapp.\nShe asked me if she can travel and when I replied her in the negative, I had to give her a detailed 2 pages typed NOT HANWRITTED explaination of why she should not.\nOn a busy Saturday afternoon OPD when she asked me the same question along with her husband, I requested her not to ask the same question again and again.\nSince you had chaproned her and were waiting outside she went like a 35 year old baby crying up to you for your comfort.\nAnd hence you wrote this feedback.\nAfter that PLEASE NOTE she again came for repeated consultations and free whatsapp consultations too.\nYou are one of my few selfish patients who suck the blood and sweat out of me and still remain ungrateful.",
