I remember the day we went we were welcomed with a smile in the face of the staff there. In fact, those smiling faces of staff remain the same even today when we visit the hospital and also it is one of the few hospitals where I have seen they check patient 1st before asking you to pay. These 1st-time experiences created a positive vibe and we decided we will consult with Dr. Shilpa for our pregnancy. During the 3rd month of pregnancy, my wife developed some complications and we rushed to the hospital. Dr. Shilpa immediately checked and admitted her for observation. From that time, it was always tense moments for us but Dr.Shilpa made sure that we are aware of the challenges and was reassuring that it will be okay. \n\nThis was another pleasant surprise waiting for us on the day of delivery. Since there were complications during the pregnancy, Dr.Shilpa suggested it might be C-Section but on the day of delivery, she said your baby is fine. I will do a normal delivery.\n\nBy God\u2019s grace, we had a cute girl child thru normal delivery. we indebted to the Dr.Shilpa some much that we have named our daughter as Shilpa as one of the names.\n\nWe are consulting with Dr.Haresh for our baby. Like all new parents we also are very anxious we used to call him or visit the hospital every week with some queries. Dr.Haresh comes across a down to earth person who explains the things patiently.\n\nI definitely recommend them to all who are looking for a caring hospital for their pregnancy\n",

Dr. Shilpa Harish was so patient and cooperative enough us to explain our condition and was with us throughout our memorable pregnancy journey. I got conceived in the month of April via IVF with the help of doctors and gods grace. But my pregnancy journey was not so smooth. Had complications of spoting in the initial days, experienced heavy bleeding in the 4th month due to low placental line, my cervix was opened up at 28th weeks and lastly had to deliver at 36 weeks due to BP fluctuations. In this tough journey Dr. Shilpa was always with us in reach everytime. She has responded to all our messages and during my 4th month bleeding she was present in the hospital at midnight before we reach there to assist us. Also, the cervix operation was carefully done and after which she was so kind enough to send her staff nurse for every 15 days to our house to provide me injection and vitals check. Here, I would like to mention the kind staff nurse as well as housekeeping staff who has helped me in this journey. Special thanks to Dr. Chitra, Shilpa sister, Maheshwari sister, Beti sister and Pilamma aunty. Just want to say that we were in right hands. And love and respect to all of them in hospital from us and our baby Ishaanvi.\ud83d\ude18",

Immediately they have started treatment to hold water leakage, infection. She was under observation for 16 days, in course of water break, placenta was also started separating, every scan was a big hurdle for us, It was challenging for Dr Shilpa too. My wife was put on complete bed rest from then, lost amniotic fluid can\u2019t be reproduced overnight, but their expertise in the field of gynecology, suggested medication along with diet plan helped us in early recovery, moving on our daily scans turned into weekly and monthly scans, She explains every part of treatment which gives confidence to the patient and hope to the family, they have dedicated staff, they have monitored hourly round the clock. They are very helpful and provide good ambiance to the patients. Hospital has well equipped and maintained with good lab. Your half pain will go when you talk to Dr Shilpa and Dr haresh Babu. Hospitals staff extended their support to our home. During 33.4 weeks my wife got pain in her abdomen, and they have done C section, we are blessed with a baby girl at 33.4 weeks. Since it was pre-term baby, she was in Rainbow NICU for 4 days and then moved to Grandhim Hospital after Dr Haresh babu assurance, since then Dr Haresh babu took personal care, and we are continuing our regular vaccination at RajaShri Grandhim Hospital. Now our baby is 3+ months old. Believe in God, never lose your confidence and have faith in your doctors.\n\n-- \nRegards\nSagar Kortalwar",

I remember the day we went we were welcomed with a smile in the face of the staff there. In fact, those smiling faces of staff remain the same even today when we visit the hospital and also it is one of the few hospitals where I have seen they check patient 1st before asking you to pay. These 1st-time experiences created a positive vibe and we decided we will consult with Dr. Shilpa for our pregnancy. During the 3rd month of pregnancy, my wife developed some complications and we rushed to the hospital. Dr. Shilpa immediately checked and admitted her for observation. From that time, it was always tense moments for us but Dr.Shilpa made sure that we are aware of the challenges and was reassuring that it will be okay. \n\nThis was another pleasant surprise waiting for us on the day of delivery. Since there were complications during the pregnancy, Dr.Shilpa suggested it might be C-Section but on the day of delivery, she said your baby is fine. I will do a normal delivery.\n\nBy God\u2019s grace, we had a cute girl child thru normal delivery. we indebted to the Dr.Shilpa some much that we have named our daughter as Shilpa as one of the names.\n\nWe are consulting with Dr.Haresh for our baby. Like all new parents we also are very anxious we used to call him or visit the hospital every week with some queries. Dr.Haresh comes across a down to earth person who explains the things patiently.\n\nI definitely recommend them to all who are looking for a caring hospital for their pregnancy\n",

Dr. Shilpa Harish was so patient and cooperative enough us to explain our condition and was with us throughout our memorable pregnancy journey. I got conceived in the month of April via IVF with the help of doctors and gods grace. But my pregnancy journey was not so smooth. Had complications of spoting in the initial days, experienced heavy bleeding in the 4th month due to low placental line, my cervix was opened up at 28th weeks and lastly had to deliver at 36 weeks due to BP fluctuations. In this tough journey Dr. Shilpa was always with us in reach everytime. She has responded to all our messages and during my 4th month bleeding she was present in the hospital at midnight before we reach there to assist us. Also, the cervix operation was carefully done and after which she was so kind enough to send her staff nurse for every 15 days to our house to provide me injection and vitals check. Here, I would like to mention the kind staff nurse as well as housekeeping staff who has helped me in this journey. Special thanks to Dr. Chitra, Shilpa sister, Maheshwari sister, Beti sister and Pilamma aunty. Just want to say that we were in right hands. And love and respect to all of them in hospital from us and our baby Ishaanvi.\ud83d\ude18",

Immediately they have started treatment to hold water leakage, infection. She was under observation for 16 days, in course of water break, placenta was also started separating, every scan was a big hurdle for us, It was challenging for Dr Shilpa too. My wife was put on complete bed rest from then, lost amniotic fluid can\u2019t be reproduced overnight, but their expertise in the field of gynecology, suggested medication along with diet plan helped us in early recovery, moving on our daily scans turned into weekly and monthly scans, She explains every part of treatment which gives confidence to the patient and hope to the family, they have dedicated staff, they have monitored hourly round the clock. They are very helpful and provide good ambiance to the patients. Hospital has well equipped and maintained with good lab. Your half pain will go when you talk to Dr Shilpa and Dr haresh Babu. Hospitals staff extended their support to our home. During 33.4 weeks my wife got pain in her abdomen, and they have done C section, we are blessed with a baby girl at 33.4 weeks. Since it was pre-term baby, she was in Rainbow NICU for 4 days and then moved to Grandhim Hospital after Dr Haresh babu assurance, since then Dr Haresh babu took personal care, and we are continuing our regular vaccination at RajaShri Grandhim Hospital. Now our baby is 3+ months old. Believe in God, never lose your confidence and have faith in your doctors.\n\n-- \nRegards\nSagar Kortalwar",

And now I'm happily delivered baby boy on May 29th 2018 at Rajshri Grandhim Hospital.\n\nMy baby is super fine now he is 3 months old and we are continuing our regular vaccination at same hospital.
