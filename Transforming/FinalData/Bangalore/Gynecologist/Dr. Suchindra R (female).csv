"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Urinary Tract Infection (Uti),",0,0,NO,"A doctor that humiliates and cannot overlook bias to treat patient. 

Since my regular gyny was away I had to meet Dr. Suchindra. I have a UTI which is an issue I have had on a recurring basis since I was 14 which is far before I became sexually active. All medical facts were overlooked and instead, i received dirty looks, rude comments and incorrect statements about my own history and diagnosis.
1. she did not read my case file - i visited earlier for a full health check up (vitimin B, D, Iron and sugar tests) compeltely separate from UTI. Yet she was fixated on ""did you have sex even 2 months back?""
2. used fear instead of a solution - ""if you keep doing this you will end up with an infection in your ovaries and not be able to have children"". I visited a doctor on immediate symptoms of irritation (within 7 days) to ensure the infection in my urinary tract is fixed. There is no chance of it reaching my ovaries so soon. Have women not been put through enough humiliation and judgment to further receive it from a doctor we are seeking help from. 
3. ""you must wear condoms"", ""you must be careful"" atleast 3 times after i had also said this may be an allergic reaction to the condom.
4. UTI is so heavily linked to guilt and humiliation in women and the doctor has put me back in that cycle. People who have been through abuse or even have low vitimin D and C levels are more likely to contract it. Yet these medical questions were NOT asked. Instead, i was asked ""Don't you ever plan to marry?""
5. I am 30, yes i have been in more than 1 committed relationship in my life. But to be stripped of the basic humanity and instead be made to feel dirty, have ""multiple partners"" written and circled on my case file and not be treated for my condition well by a medical professional is shocking. 
These are things that affect mental health. It is gross to know a doctor can misuse thier practice and shamed a patient so badly. I had to visit another gynecologist, spend my time, money and energy to get healed. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR to anyone regardless of what your life choices or lifestyle is.
