Has helped me so much with everything I have been through! Really efficient.\n\nNot only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient.\n\nDr. Smriti is indeed, the most treasured of the Doctors I have been privileged to meet.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the good skills she has as a doctor but also the good heart, one that cares for others.\n\nHer care really made me feel that I am in safe hands throughout my pregnancy.\n\nHer personal touch and willingness to spend time with her patients explaining the situation is a welcome trait.\n\nI feel most fortunate to have her as my gynaecologist.\n\nShe is kind of a person who tells you what is going on in regular language and not in \"doctor talk\".\n\nDr Smriti is genuinely blessed with the magical power to treat a life.\n\nShe made my journey of pregnancy stress free and a relaxed one.\n\nDr. Smriti\u2019s presence holds positive vibes that is more powerful than any medicines.\n\nThank you doctor for the wonderful birthing experience, no words are enough to appreciate the service you do.\n\nYour talent and caring manner is a credit to the medical profession.\n\nWe will continue to recommend you to all the couples who are planning for a baby.\n\nWe will keep you in Our prayers",

Finally not able to avoid it any more I reached out to Doctor smrithi at Aster.  I was totally surprised to find her so approachable, kind and reassuring.  I put to her countless questions which may have been very basic.  She answered every one of them with a smile. She explained the procedure I had to undergo patiently. She finally gave me her number to whatsApp questions if I could think of more so she could answer them. I was amazed and felt  very comfortable with her.  Scheduled my surgery ASAP.  Doctor Smrithi and Doctor Sunil Eshwar have done a wonderful job. I am now very happily recovering post surgery.  Having a reassuring smile a kind word and a confident demeanor works wonders when one is petrified and full of questions.  It is all we need to calm us down. I am very grateful and sincerely thank Doctor Smrithi and Doctor Sunil Eshwar for their support.",

She has always heard my numerous problems and concerns patiently and addressed it with a smile and genuineness. Dr. Smrithi has this ability to empathize with her patients and make them feel like they're talking to a friend. She explains the treatment plan - what is being done and why/why not. She is open to feedback which is not a quality which we come across very often. I feel really blessed that I found a doctor like her and recommend her wholeheartedly to everyone. *** ** ***** *** **** ****** **** **** ****** **** ****",

Has helped me so much with everything I have been through! Really efficient.\n\nNot only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient.\n\nDr. Smriti is indeed, the most treasured of the Doctors I have been privileged to meet.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the good skills she has as a doctor but also the good heart, one that cares for others.\n\nHer care really made me feel that I am in safe hands throughout my pregnancy.\n\nHer personal touch and willingness to spend time with her patients explaining the situation is a welcome trait.\n\nI feel most fortunate to have her as my gynaecologist.\n\nShe is kind of a person who tells you what is going on in regular language and not in \"doctor talk\".\n\nDr Smriti is genuinely blessed with the magical power to treat a life.\n\nShe made my journey of pregnancy stress free and a relaxed one.\n\nDr. Smriti\u2019s presence holds positive vibes that is more powerful than any medicines.\n\nThank you doctor for the wonderful birthing experience, no words are enough to appreciate the service you do.\n\nYour talent and caring manner is a credit to the medical profession.\n\nWe will continue to recommend you to all the couples who are planning for a baby.\n\nWe will keep you in Our prayers",

Finally not able to avoid it any more I reached out to Doctor smrithi at Aster.  I was totally surprised to find her so approachable, kind and reassuring.  I put to her countless questions which may have been very basic.  She answered every one of them with a smile. She explained the procedure I had to undergo patiently. She finally gave me her number to whatsApp questions if I could think of more so she could answer them. I was amazed and felt  very comfortable with her.  Scheduled my surgery ASAP.  Doctor Smrithi and Doctor Sunil Eshwar have done a wonderful job. I am now very happily recovering post surgery.  Having a reassuring smile a kind word and a confident demeanor works wonders when one is petrified and full of questions.  It is all we need to calm us down. I am very grateful and sincerely thank Doctor Smrithi and Doctor Sunil Eshwar for their support.",

The best thing about her is she has a very nice comforting vibe which is very rare. She is available on phone at the oddest of hours and has the patient's best interests at heart. She has always heard my numerous problems and concerns patiently and addressed it with a smile and genuineness. Dr. Smrithi has this ability to empathize with her patients and make them feel like they're talking to a friend. She explains the treatment plan - what is being done and why/why not. She is open to feedback which is not a quality which we come across very often. I feel really blessed that I found a doctor like her and recommend her wholeheartedly to everyone. *** ** ***** *** **** ****** **** **** ****** **** ****",

But, what really makes her stand out is how she made me feel like I was her only patient and that she would spend as much time with me as I needed. she was incredibly thought my pregnancy. I think the highest compliment one can give a doctor is that they treat a patient like a member of their family and Dr. Smruthi D Naik did that for me. I feel so lucky to have found her. Above all, she was very helpful to visit to hospital during late night as there was no fetus movement during 7th month. She spoke to me with lot of positive vibes and  observed me for 2-3 hours, finally everything was good.",
