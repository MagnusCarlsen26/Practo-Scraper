She never imposes her opinions on her patients and always respects their choices. What's more, she always takes the time to answer any questions, even on odd hours, making herself available when it is necessary. She is always friendly and professional, making each visit feel comfortable and informative.\n\nShe is a mix of optimism and realist, motivating us while also showing them the mirror when needed. Her words of encouragement were crucial and her positivity kept me motivated in our parenthood journey.\n\nDr Latha is so much more than our doctor, having been instrumental in our journey towards conceiving twins. Thanks to her and her nursing staff, we were able to have a successful journey, and I cannot begin to express my gratitude for what she has done for my family.\nI cannot recommend her enough to couples trying to conceive. She is an absolute treasure and an excellent physician. Anyone who has the privilege of working with her and her team will certainly be blessed. Thank you, doctor, for all that you've done and continue to do!",

She never imposes her opinions on her patients and always respects their choices. What's more, she always takes the time to answer any questions, even on odd hours, making herself available when it is necessary. She is always friendly and professional, making each visit feel comfortable and informative.\n\nShe is a mix of optimism and realist, motivating us while also showing them the mirror when needed. Her words of encouragement were crucial and her positivity kept me motivated in our parenthood journey.\n\nDr Latha is so much more than our doctor, having been instrumental in our journey towards conceiving twins. Thanks to her and her nursing staff, we were able to have a successful journey, and I cannot begin to express my gratitude for what she has done for my family.\nI cannot recommend her enough to couples trying to conceive. She is an absolute treasure and an excellent physician. Anyone who has the privilege of working with her and her team will certainly be blessed. Thank you, doctor, for all that you've done and continue to do!",
