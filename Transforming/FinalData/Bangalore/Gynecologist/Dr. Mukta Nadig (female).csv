"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy,Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy Tests,Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"I still remember the day (Monday morning - when I was still jet-lagged) when we visited Dr. Mukta Nadig in Cloud 9,  Malleswaram for a Pregnancy Check Up. My wife (Harshini) was apprehensive,excited, nervous, scared, jittery and tensed;  she was basically in unknown territory! 

Appointment taken and we were waiting! Those few minutes felt like forever!! Dr.Mukta welcomed us into the room and she spoke to us just like a friend. She comforted us and asked us the routine questions; she advised us to go for a pregnancy test. The following weekend, my wife and I were supposed to fly to Bali, Indonesia. When we inquired with Dr.Mukta, she firmly advised us against the trip as trips can always be postponed, however, the bundle of joy arriving soon and it's happiness cannot be expressed in words! How right she was!

All through our scans, multiple pregnancy check up visits , she guided us along the correct path. There were stages where there were reasons to get tensed and scared, however, she assured us and calmed us. She gave us strict advice to avoid outside food(as much as possible) and eliminate any source that can cause problem to the  baby. We adhered to the 'T' and I guess that's what was the best for the baby and mommy!

She encouraged mommy to be as active as possible - regular walks, Pre-Natal Yoga (Squats are great) - to target a Normal Delivery. This pushed mommy(and Daddy) for regular walks! Dr Mukta also encouraged mommy (and Daddy) to actively take Lamaze classes (which tremendously helped during Mommy's active labor) . All these are indications to Dr Mukta's sustained efforts for mommy's normal delivery!

Come the 'D' day where the bundle of joy wanted to come out and Dr. Mukta was right there to help mommy with the delivery! As Harshini was wheeled into the Labor ward, I wasn't allowed in( COVID restrictions). The next 45 minutes, I can be best described as a Train Wreck. I could hear Harshini pushing and pushing, and there comes our Dr Mukta - She was calm, assured and armed with the million+ deliveries'(feels like it!) experience, she brought out the angel to this world. She was also available in the Inpatient room for us as part of her rounds that she does!

I would definitely advice Dr Mukta all the way from Pregnancy Check Up till Post Pregnancy! She is calm, ************** smart, experienced, firm and assuring!

It was a precious pregnancy as I had a history of recurrent miscarriages and was NK cell deficient. I was in a really bad need of a good gynecologist, who would understand my problem. I came across Dr.Mukta from all these great reviews about her on practo. When I first visited her she read all my reports with patience and reassured me that this time everything's going to be fine. I started consulting her and things went on really smooth. (I was put on LMWH injections and ecosprin.) In every appointment doctor would go through even the smallest detail in my reports and would take timely, precise decisions. She never prescribes unnecessary tests or medications. Her treatment is always on point. I would definitely recommend her to everyone. 
In my third trimester I was low on Hemoglobin,so doctor suggested me a Iron injection which is given through IV. I was really scared to get that injection and I still remember  she went to the nurse personally and advised her to be gentle with me as i was scared. She also came twice to check on me. who does that? I mean which doctor takes so much care of a patient. This act of her really touched my heart. Lucky me...! 
Also Due to my past history of miscarriages I used to overthink a lot and would ask so many questions but doctor was always ready to answer even my silliest question. She always welcomed me with a smile and throughout my pregnancy she boosted me with confidence. During my labour she came to hospital at midnight in no time for which I am really greatful to her. I can actually go on and on and would still not stop praising her. She's one of a kind. Thank you so much Dr.Mukta.
