Her focus is to empower patients with choices and work with them to arrive at the best results for the mother & baby. Her guidance and holistic approach to staying healthy ensured that I had an almost smooth pregnancy and that ultimately helped me in giving birth through NVD.\u00a0She handles any complication or hiccup during the pregnancy journey with a devoted and caring approach. My husband and I are forever grateful for her guidance and support through this period. Would highly recommend her.\u00a0",

                "review_text": "I had the privilege of being under the care of Dr. Namrata during my pregnancy and my journey with PCOS, and I can't praise her enough for the incredible support and expertise she provided.\n\nIn a world where the 'C' in C-section seems to stand for \"common,\" Dr. Namrata champions the 'N' in normal delivery with gusto.\n\nMy adventures in pregnancy began early on when I had bleeding episodes and contracted COVID during the 14th week of my pregnancy. Dr Namrata was not only my medical guide but also a pillar of support throughout this trying period.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Dr. Namrata's care was her holistic approach to pregnancy. She encouraged me to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which included prenatal yoga and even recommended a Yoga Guru. This recommendation not only helped me maintain an optimal weight but also kept me active and energised throughout my pregnancy. Her guidance in this regard contributed significantly to my overall well-being and made the journey to motherhood more enjoyable.\n\nThe luxury of time she offers her patients is something I really appreciate. Appointments were never rushed; she never hesitated to dedicate ample time to explain, clarify, and address all of our concerns - no matter how trivial they may have seemed.\nThis is true for her appointments as well as queries on Whatsapp; she was always just a message away on WhatsApp, promptly addressing any doubts or concerns I had. This accessibility and her willingness to engage in open and clear communication gave me peace of mind throughout my pregnancy.\n\nThough, I am one to get myself tested for every little thing, the doctor doesn't believe in overmedication or unnecessary tests and has a minimalist approach. \nShe's not one to prescribe a pharmacy-worth of pills or send you on a wild goose chase for endless tests/scans.\n\nAdditionally, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my pregnancy. Instead of rushing to medication, Dr. Namrata encouraged me to manage it through diet and exercise, again emphasising the importance of a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy.\n\nThen came the moment when my mucus plug decided it had better places to be at 35 weeks, and the prospect of a preterm delivery loomed large. However, the doctor was quick to respond with a plan to delay the delivery by a week and make it as smooth as possible for both me and my baby. Thanks to her expertise and guidance, my baby did not require a stay in the NICU, and the entire childbirth experience was remarkably smooth.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Namrata to any expectant mother looking for a compassionate and knowledgeable gynaecologist who values the importance of natural childbirth. \nShe's simply fantastic at what she does, and her results speak for themselves. No need for over-the-top praise, just heartfelt gratitude for a skilled, and compassionate gynaecologist who made my pregnancy journey an extraordinary one.\n",

                "review_text": "I will say 100% that we made the right decision in choosing Dr.Namrata Nagendra for my second pregnancy. Under her immense care, right treatment and guidance, I delivered a baby boy successfully on Sept 25, 2022 among complications like gestational diabetes and urinary tract infection. \n\nI was in my native place during the conception of my second baby and was visiting local doctor for the first 4 months. At the end of 3rd month, I was diagnosed with diabetes and the local doctor gave me lots of stress and tension and totally demotivated me. That's when I started consulting Namrata doctor through video call. I chose the doctor purely based on the reviews and hence was bit skeptical. But starting from the first call, I liked the way doctor handled my situation and gave me the confidence to face it. I came back to Bangalore in 5th month and started visiting her in-person and that's when I got my peace of mind back. It was a big stress relief for me and I started enjoying my pregnancy. Under her guidance and along with yoga and diet control, I switched from insulin to tablet and then stopped tablet also, all in a span of 2.5 months. If we get diabetes, most doctors say that we need to take insulin or tablet till the end of the pregnancy or even post that. The local doctor also said the same. But I wanted to bring my sugar levels under control without any medication and the local doctor did not support me at all. She did not even listen to me. But Namrata doctor supported me, gave me the right guidance and helped me to stop medication and that was a big stress relief for me. Thank you very much Doctor!\n\nAnother stress factor was urinary tract infection in my 4th month. The local doctor asked me to take injection for 5 days but Namrata doctor asked me to stop it immediately because it was a powerful dose and could harm the baby. She gave me a low dose tablet and the infection got cured. She also stopped bunch of other tablets that I was taking as given by the local doctor. Namrata doctor gives minimum tablets and also of low dosage and also suggests minimal tests and scans. \n\nMost doctors don't spend time with patients in listening to our concerns or worries. But Namrata doctor listens to patients concerns and worries and gives motivation, encouragement and positivity to handle the situation. At the same time, she is transparent in explaining the problem also and doesn't hide anything from us. \n\nI wanted to try VBAC since my first delivery was c-section. Doctor was very supportive for that as well and explained me the criteria for it. But since my scar thickness was very thin, I wasn't able to try for normal and delivered through c-section. It was midnight 3 AM when my water broke and the baby passed motion as well inside the womb, so it was an emergent situation. Though it was night time, doctor immediately came to the hospital and successfully delivered the baby. \n\nEven among these complications, doctor always motivated me to be active and never suggested me to take rest. Along with yoga, my post recovery was pretty fast compared to my first one, though my age got increased by 7 years between the 2 deliveries! For my first c-section I was very tired for the first 2-3 weeks but for my second c-section, I was able to climb stairs on my 3rd day and got pretty active in the first week itself!\n\nOverall, 3 things about the doctor stands out - patience, positivity and easily approachable. Doctor is available on watsapp and is very prompt and responsive in answering our messages. It was a very pleasant experience with the doctor and I would strongly recommend this doctor to anyone.  \n\n",

From the very beginning, when complications arose due to fibroids and the need for cervical encirclage emerged, Dr. Namrata stepped in like a guardian angel, guiding us with her expertise and empathy.\n\nHer compassionate approach made us feel like family rather than just patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of Muskan's condition, alleviating our concerns and ensuring we were well-informed every step of the way. Her reassuring presence gave us the strength to navigate through the challenges of a difficult pregnancy.\n\nWhen it came time for Muskan's delivery, Dr. Namrata's skill and dedication were truly remarkable. She ensured that Muskan felt comfortable and empowered throughout the process, guiding her with patience and professionalism. Thanks to her expertise and unwavering support, Muskan was able to undergo a successful normal vaginal delivery, despite the initial complications.\n\nDr. Namrata's impact on our lives goes beyond her medical expertise. She provided not just medical care, but emotional support and encouragement when we needed it most. We are forever grateful to her for her dedication, kindness, and the precious gift of bringing our baby into this world safely.\n\nIn our eyes, Dr. Namrata is more than just a doctor; she is a blessing, a beacon of hope, and a true guardian of maternal health. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking exceptional care during their pregnancy journey. Thank you, Dr. Namrata, for everything you've done for us. You've made a profound difference in our lives, and we will always be indebted to you.",

I delivered a 3.6kg baby vaginally with her.\nI am a OBGY specialist working in UK and I came to Namrata for my pregnancy and delivery. She practices the latest Uk guidelines . As this was my first pregnancy I was nervous and being a doctor, the anxiety level is a lot more.\n\nI have worked with her before and I knew about her passion and dedication to the patients and she always makes sure they get the best outcome no mater what the case may be. \n\nDuring my pregnancy I wasn\u2019t sure about going through a vaginal birth, but she always motivated me.   She listens to you and address all the issues without dismissing your concerns. I always felt like everything was easy and that is a rare feeling to get.\n\nWhen I got into labour , she personally called the staff and doctors with instructions and would regular check on the labour progress. Once I got into active labour she was there in the hospital with me from 8pm and sacrificed her family time for which I am grateful . Having her there in the labour room during the most painful phase reassured me. I was able to just concentrate on myself without worrying about the medical stuff. At the last part of labour when I had to push, it was painful inspite of having epidural analgesia, but she  was calm yet in control of the situation. This final stage can get tough and it is easy to give up  but she kept encouraging to keep going. I still cannot believe I had a normal delivery and this is only and only because of her support .\n\nPost delivery she had come regularly to check on me. This is the most underrated phase with probelms ranging from breastfeeding initiation, pain and aches from top to bottom , lack of sleep , baby\u2019s jaundice issues  and the emotional roller coaster , so instead of saying everything will get back to normal she provided solutions to tackle this  phase.\n\n I have not only been blessed with this pregnancy but my journey with Namrata has made this the most beautiful phase. Hence as a doctor and as a patient  I strongly recommend Dr Namrata for your care.",

Her compassionate approach and reassuring demeanor helped alleviate any anxiety or fears I had along the way.As the due date approached, Dr. Namrata continued to be readily available, and I felt confident that I was in the best hands possible. When the time came for delivery, she exhibited a perfect balance of confidence and calmness, which reassured me during the labor process.The postnatal care provided by Dr. Namrata and her team was equally remarkable. They provided guidance on breastfeeding, postpartum recovery, and were always there to address any concerns that arose during the early days of motherhood.Overall, I recommend Dr. Namrata highly enough. Her expertise, caring nature, and commitment to her patients make her an exceptional maternity doctor. I am immensely grateful for the care I received and will undoubtedly seek her services if I decide to expand my family in the future.Thank you, Dr. Namrata, for making my pregnancy journey a positive and memorable one.",

New to the Bangalore city, I read lots and lots of reviews on Practo & took a leap of faith to go with a relatively young age doctor with plethora of positive reviews and recommendations.The first thing that you will notice when you meet her is her friendly nature. In no time, you will start feeling that you are in safe hands. She takes care of her patients very well. She is always available to give suggestions(responds quickly on whatsapp, reviews reports, follows up on the diet plan, tracks sugar levels on a regular basis and what not). She is extremely practical. She gave me a clear cut guidelines that for normal delivery the weight of the baby has to be in a certain range and I should have the strength to deliver the baby. And, I should focus my efforts only towards that. It was important for me to keep a track of my weight (have a strict diet plan) and do regular exercise to ensure that my body has the stamina and capacity to handle labour pain. She helped me a lot in this. Within a few months, I realized that she has the right balance of being friendly and being strict / super strict like a mother. She plans everything in advance, encourages to read more about pregnancy and ask more questions and clear all doubts. A perfect, no-nonsense doctor who removes all the unnecessary steps and guides you with only what's important and relevant for you. She encouraged me to continue going to office till 9th month, continue with regular household work. She doesn't let you feel bad, less energetic/effective just because you are pregnant. She helped me sail through in a smooth manner. I had a normal delivery(this is what I had requested her for in my first visit :) ).I would strongly recommend her for all couples who need a doctor whom they can completely trust. ",

Her focus is to empower patients with choices and work with them to arrive at the best results for the mother & baby. Her guidance and holistic approach to staying healthy ensured that I had an almost smooth pregnancy and that ultimately helped me in giving birth through NVD.\u00a0She handles any complication or hiccup during the pregnancy journey with a devoted and caring approach. My husband and I are forever grateful for her guidance and support through this period. Would highly recommend her.\u00a0",

                "review_text": "I had the privilege of being under the care of Dr. Namrata during my pregnancy and my journey with PCOS, and I can't praise her enough for the incredible support and expertise she provided.\n\nIn a world where the 'C' in C-section seems to stand for \"common,\" Dr. Namrata champions the 'N' in normal delivery with gusto.\n\nMy adventures in pregnancy began early on when I had bleeding episodes and contracted COVID during the 14th week of my pregnancy. Dr Namrata was not only my medical guide but also a pillar of support throughout this trying period.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Dr. Namrata's care was her holistic approach to pregnancy. She encouraged me to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which included prenatal yoga and even recommended a Yoga Guru. This recommendation not only helped me maintain an optimal weight but also kept me active and energised throughout my pregnancy. Her guidance in this regard contributed significantly to my overall well-being and made the journey to motherhood more enjoyable.\n\nThe luxury of time she offers her patients is something I really appreciate. Appointments were never rushed; she never hesitated to dedicate ample time to explain, clarify, and address all of our concerns - no matter how trivial they may have seemed.\nThis is true for her appointments as well as queries on Whatsapp; she was always just a message away on WhatsApp, promptly addressing any doubts or concerns I had. This accessibility and her willingness to engage in open and clear communication gave me peace of mind throughout my pregnancy.\n\nThough, I am one to get myself tested for every little thing, the doctor doesn't believe in overmedication or unnecessary tests and has a minimalist approach. \nShe's not one to prescribe a pharmacy-worth of pills or send you on a wild goose chase for endless tests/scans.\n\nAdditionally, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my pregnancy. Instead of rushing to medication, Dr. Namrata encouraged me to manage it through diet and exercise, again emphasising the importance of a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy.\n\nThen came the moment when my mucus plug decided it had better places to be at 35 weeks, and the prospect of a preterm delivery loomed large. However, the doctor was quick to respond with a plan to delay the delivery by a week and make it as smooth as possible for both me and my baby. Thanks to her expertise and guidance, my baby did not require a stay in the NICU, and the entire childbirth experience was remarkably smooth.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Namrata to any expectant mother looking for a compassionate and knowledgeable gynaecologist who values the importance of natural childbirth. \nShe's simply fantastic at what she does, and her results speak for themselves. No need for over-the-top praise, just heartfelt gratitude for a skilled, and compassionate gynaecologist who made my pregnancy journey an extraordinary one.\n",

                "review_text": "I will say 100% that we made the right decision in choosing Dr.Namrata Nagendra for my second pregnancy. Under her immense care, right treatment and guidance, I delivered a baby boy successfully on Sept 25, 2022 among complications like gestational diabetes and urinary tract infection. \n\nI was in my native place during the conception of my second baby and was visiting local doctor for the first 4 months. At the end of 3rd month, I was diagnosed with diabetes and the local doctor gave me lots of stress and tension and totally demotivated me. That's when I started consulting Namrata doctor through video call. I chose the doctor purely based on the reviews and hence was bit skeptical. But starting from the first call, I liked the way doctor handled my situation and gave me the confidence to face it. I came back to Bangalore in 5th month and started visiting her in-person and that's when I got my peace of mind back. It was a big stress relief for me and I started enjoying my pregnancy. Under her guidance and along with yoga and diet control, I switched from insulin to tablet and then stopped tablet also, all in a span of 2.5 months. If we get diabetes, most doctors say that we need to take insulin or tablet till the end of the pregnancy or even post that. The local doctor also said the same. But I wanted to bring my sugar levels under control without any medication and the local doctor did not support me at all. She did not even listen to me. But Namrata doctor supported me, gave me the right guidance and helped me to stop medication and that was a big stress relief for me. Thank you very much Doctor!\n\nAnother stress factor was urinary tract infection in my 4th month. The local doctor asked me to take injection for 5 days but Namrata doctor asked me to stop it immediately because it was a powerful dose and could harm the baby. She gave me a low dose tablet and the infection got cured. She also stopped bunch of other tablets that I was taking as given by the local doctor. Namrata doctor gives minimum tablets and also of low dosage and also suggests minimal tests and scans. \n\nMost doctors don't spend time with patients in listening to our concerns or worries. But Namrata doctor listens to patients concerns and worries and gives motivation, encouragement and positivity to handle the situation. At the same time, she is transparent in explaining the problem also and doesn't hide anything from us. \n\nI wanted to try VBAC since my first delivery was c-section. Doctor was very supportive for that as well and explained me the criteria for it. But since my scar thickness was very thin, I wasn't able to try for normal and delivered through c-section. It was midnight 3 AM when my water broke and the baby passed motion as well inside the womb, so it was an emergent situation. Though it was night time, doctor immediately came to the hospital and successfully delivered the baby. \n\nEven among these complications, doctor always motivated me to be active and never suggested me to take rest. Along with yoga, my post recovery was pretty fast compared to my first one, though my age got increased by 7 years between the 2 deliveries! For my first c-section I was very tired for the first 2-3 weeks but for my second c-section, I was able to climb stairs on my 3rd day and got pretty active in the first week itself!\n\nOverall, 3 things about the doctor stands out - patience, positivity and easily approachable. Doctor is available on watsapp and is very prompt and responsive in answering our messages. It was a very pleasant experience with the doctor and I would strongly recommend this doctor to anyone.  \n\n",

From the very beginning, when complications arose due to fibroids and the need for cervical encirclage emerged, Dr. Namrata stepped in like a guardian angel, guiding us with her expertise and empathy.\n\nHer compassionate approach made us feel like family rather than just patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of Muskan's condition, alleviating our concerns and ensuring we were well-informed every step of the way. Her reassuring presence gave us the strength to navigate through the challenges of a difficult pregnancy.\n\nWhen it came time for Muskan's delivery, Dr. Namrata's skill and dedication were truly remarkable. She ensured that Muskan felt comfortable and empowered throughout the process, guiding her with patience and professionalism. Thanks to her expertise and unwavering support, Muskan was able to undergo a successful normal vaginal delivery, despite the initial complications.\n\nDr. Namrata's impact on our lives goes beyond her medical expertise. She provided not just medical care, but emotional support and encouragement when we needed it most. We are forever grateful to her for her dedication, kindness, and the precious gift of bringing our baby into this world safely.\n\nIn our eyes, Dr. Namrata is more than just a doctor; she is a blessing, a beacon of hope, and a true guardian of maternal health. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking exceptional care during their pregnancy journey. Thank you, Dr. Namrata, for everything you've done for us.

I delivered a 3.6kg baby vaginally with her.\nI am a OBGY specialist working in UK and I came to Namrata for my pregnancy and delivery. She practices the latest Uk guidelines . As this was my first pregnancy I was nervous and being a doctor, the anxiety level is a lot more.\n\nI have worked with her before and I knew about her passion and dedication to the patients and she always makes sure they get the best outcome no mater what the case may be. \n\nDuring my pregnancy I wasn\u2019t sure about going through a vaginal birth, but she always motivated me.   She listens to you and address all the issues without dismissing your concerns. I always felt like everything was easy and that is a rare feeling to get.\n\nWhen I got into labour , she personally called the staff and doctors with instructions and would regular check on the labour progress. Once I got into active labour she was there in the hospital with me from 8pm and sacrificed her family time for which I am grateful . Having her there in the labour room during the most painful phase reassured me. I was able to just concentrate on myself without worrying about the medical stuff. At the last part of labour when I had to push, it was painful inspite of having epidural analgesia, but she  was calm yet in control of the situation. This final stage can get tough and it is easy to give up  but she kept encouraging to keep going. I still cannot believe I had a normal delivery and this is only and only because of her support .\n\nPost delivery she had come regularly to check on me. This is the most underrated phase with probelms ranging from breastfeeding initiation, pain and aches from top to bottom , lack of sleep , baby\u2019s jaundice issues  and the emotional roller coaster , so instead of saying everything will get back to normal she provided solutions to tackle this  phase.\n\n I have not only been blessed with this pregnancy but my journey with Namrata has made this the most beautiful phase. Hence as a doctor and as a patient  I strongly recommend Dr Namrata for your care.",

They made me feel comfortable and at ease during every visit, which was especially important during such a significant life event.Dr. Namrata is an exceptional maternity doctor. Her expertise, knowledge, and professionalism were evident in every interaction. She took the time to listen to my concerns, answer all my questions, and thoroughly explain every step of the process. I never felt rushed during appointments, and she made me feel like a valued and empowered partner in my own prenatal care.Throughout the pregnancy, Dr. Namrata demonstrated a genuine passion for her work, and her dedication to ensuring the health and well-being of both me and my baby was evident at every turn. Her compassionate approach and reassuring demeanor helped alleviate any anxiety or fears I had along the way.As the due date approached, Dr. Namrata continued to be readily available, and I felt confident that I was in the best hands possible. When the time came for delivery, she exhibited a perfect balance of confidence and calmness, which reassured me during the labor process.The postnatal care provided by Dr. Namrata and her team was equally remarkable. They provided guidance on breastfeeding, postpartum recovery, and were always there to address any concerns that arose during the early days of motherhood.Overall, I recommend Dr. Namrata highly enough. Her expertise, caring nature, and commitment to her patients make her an exceptional maternity doctor. I am immensely grateful for the care I received and will undoubtedly seek her services if I decide to expand my family in the future.Thank you, Dr. Namrata, for making my pregnancy journey a positive and memorable one.",

New to the Bangalore city, I read lots and lots of reviews on Practo & took a leap of faith to go with a relatively young age doctor with plethora of positive reviews and recommendations.The first thing that you will notice when you meet her is her friendly nature. In no time, you will start feeling that you are in safe hands. She takes care of her patients very well. She is always available to give suggestions(responds quickly on whatsapp, reviews reports, follows up on the diet plan, tracks sugar levels on a regular basis and what not). She is extremely practical. She gave me a clear cut guidelines that for normal delivery the weight of the baby has to be in a certain range and I should have the strength to deliver the baby. And, I should focus my efforts only towards that. It was important for me to keep a track of my weight (have a strict diet plan) and do regular exercise to ensure that my body has the stamina and capacity to handle labour pain. She helped me a lot in this. Within a few months, I realized that she has the right balance of being friendly and being strict / super strict like a mother. She plans everything in advance, encourages to read more about pregnancy and ask more questions and clear all doubts. A perfect, no-nonsense doctor who removes all the unnecessary steps and guides you with only what's important and relevant for you. She encouraged me to continue going to office till 9th month, continue with regular household work. She doesn't let you feel bad, less energetic/effective just because you are pregnant. She helped me sail through in a smooth manner. I had a normal delivery(this is what I had requested her for in my first visit :) ).I would strongly recommend her for all couples who need a doctor whom they can completely trust. ",

She makes you feel so comfortable from the very first appointment and knows in and out of what is the exact issue her patient is facing. She doesn\u2019t scare you and gives you a lot of confidence and really cares for you with all her heart . I had hyperemesis gravidarum during my pregnancy and could not function at all during my first trimester. I wanted to terminate my pregnancy as I couldn\u2019t deal with mental and physical stress but she promised me that she would be with me throughout my pregnancy journey and will ensure beautiful delivery of my baby and she did exactly what she promised she would do. I had normal Vaginal delivery and I breezed through it in no time as doctor was there by my side throughout and having her by your side gives a lot of boost and confidence, She is just a call or text away and will respond to you at any hour of the day even on weekends. She is always for normal delivery and does not advocate c section unless any major complications unlike many other gynaecologists. I met a lot of doctors during my HG but was never satisfied with anyone, I guess it was because I had already met the best. I am holding my cute li\u2019l princess today and I 100% owe it to Dr Namratha. I also had PCOS and thought I could never conceive naturally but she was always positive and not once did she discourage me and like she said I got pregnant within 3 months naturally with just few lifestyle changes. She is highly non judgemental and you can trust her with your eyes closed. I will highly recommend everyone to choose Dr Namratha as your gynaecologist , she is beauty with brains! Thank you so much for everything, doctor.",

As I write this review, I literally mean every word of it.\n\nBeing an outsider and first pregnancy, I was looking for a place near to me, where I can get a dedicated attention. Thanks to Google, we found Dr. Namrata. We started consulting her for the pre-pregnancy counselling and in the first visit itself, we didn't have a second thought. It was assured that we are in safe hands.  \n\nDr. Namrata is very confident, knowledgeable, friendly, transparent and honest. She explains everything you need to know beforehand, all pros and cons in details in simple language so that you are ready even in case of any bad situation. There won't be sugar coated advice from her just to make you feel good, but she suggests the right thing which brings fruit at a later stage. She's there throughout the pregnancy being a proper guide, focusing more on lifestyle changes rather than unnecessary medications. Following her advice, I didn't have any side symptoms like bodyache, bloating, swollen feet etc in my entire  pregnancy. She ensures that the money and time are utilised at right place, advising on the best possible solution at every step. Just book an appointment and She takes care of the rest, she makes sure that scans, blood tests, hospital etc get done at the ease. \n\nDr Namrata is an angel sent by God to welcome more angels to earth hassle-free. She was constantly monitoring me throughout the labour being my rock, I owe her completely for my NVD. Just few hours after delivery, I was as fit as any normal girl. She's not a doctor, she's a friend/sister who's just a message away for any silliest queries and concerns(this is rare to find these days and this shows how personal she takes her patients and their well being). Every visit to her is like a therapy, that makes you anxiety-free. She always involved my husband in everything, which I loved personally. The fees you pay at this clinic is like a shell in the sea in this medical world, compared to the care, focus and positive vibes you get. \nWords will fall short, if I go on writing about Dr. Namrata, a highly broad-minded and non judgemental doctor. I'll always recommend her ** *** **** ************* *** *** **** ** ***** ******* ****** *** ********",

And I must say, that turned out to be the best decision for us. We conceived the very next month of following her advice and since then, she's been nothing less than a guardian angel.In the 12th week, I was diagnosed with a short cervix during our NT scan. She took no chances and immediately proceeded with surgery while most doctors would have wanted to wait and watch. Later in the 6th month, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes which she managed calmly through diet control and minimal medication. She ensured my weight gain was minimal while making sure that my baby was growing well.Finally, she delivered our healthy baby girl and gave us the biggest gift of our lives.Her clinic is also maintained professionally with minimal wait time even on weekends. She spends quality time with her patients during consultation and answers even the silliest of doubts via WhatsApp anytime.Apart from all this which covers how good she is as a doctor, I thank her for how well she managed my shooting anxiety levels like a friend. She was very confident of doing a normal delivery for me but due to my anxiety, I wanted an elective c section which she tried convincing me against but ultimately understood that I'm too anxious to go through labour.*** *** ***** * *** ***** I recommend her to every woman who wants to meet with a friendly, non judgemental and broad minded doctor.",

Your search for a gynaecologist whom you can trust, who is receptive, who will make you feel like home and who puts the interest of the patient first, ends here. \n\nPregnancy is a beautiful  journey which can turn stressful in the absence of a doctor you can trust. Thanks to google and reviews of past patients, We were lucky to discover Dr Namrata while searching for a doctor to consult in our first journey as parents.\n\nWe were very impressed by Dr Namrata's philosophy which encouraged normal delivery, avoid overmedication, giving priority to what is best for the long term for the patient. We never felt there was any conflict of interest in whatever she advised us.\n\nDr. Namrata gave ample time in her clinic and genuinely listened to all our concerns and never looked in hurry. Beyond the clinic, she was accessible any time of day over text and felt she was not just a doctor but a counselor, a friend whom we could reach out to when ever required.\n\nFor me as father, the best part was when the D Day arrived and doctor encouraged me to be in the labor/delivery room for the entire duration which was more than 5 hours. Doctor Namrata was instrumental in ensuring we were calm during this stressful period. It was surreal to see the natural vaginal delivery and appreciate the woman body. As a father, it made me even more sensitive and appreciative of what a mother goes through. \n\nThis privilege would not have been possible without Dr. Namrata and me and my wife will forever be grateful to her for the most precious moment of our life. \n\nWe became parents to our son Aaroh on 28th September 2022 with the magic hands of Dr Namratha! \n\nWe express our gratitude and whole-heartedly recommend Dr Namrata to all lovely couples looking to become parents! \n",

We consulted pre pregnancy and she understood our pain, guided more like a friend than Doctor in planning our second pregnancy and was with us all through the journey giving us the much needed positivity. While everything was not smooth with our second pregnancy, she constantly encouraged us to be positive and guided us with the available options. With high NT in the scan, we almost lost hope, at some point, didn't follow Dr. Namrata's suggestion but she's always there, like a friend and sister and ensured that we're trying all the possible options before giving up. With such care and knowledge that she carries, my pregnancy went so smooth that I didn't even feel pregnant all through nine months; I trusted and followed her all through pregnancy, including diet and yoga asans, resulting a smooth nine months and happy delivery of baby girl. Doc is available 24*7 for our questions and promptly followed up with me on how I was doing all through pregnancy. Dr. Namrata is the next best thing happened to us after our baby during this pregnancy. From friends and family saying Normal delivery may not be possible to delivering our little princess through natural labour, my baby girl is both God and Dr. Namrata's gift to us. \n\nI recommend Dr. Namrata more than 100%. If you're looking for a Gynaec, look no further, she's the best you could consult in Bangalore; no unwanted medicines or scans, just what is right for you and your health profile.\n\nThank you Doctor for being a beautiful soul. \u2764\ufe0f",

Thankful to have her as my obgyn!\n\nWe moved to Bangalore during the 6th month of my pregnancy and I was searching for an obgyn. I found Dr. Namrata on Practo and based on positive reviews I decided to have a video consultation. At first I was hesitant and doubtful as I was going to her purely based on online reviews.\n\nThat changed over the remaining course of my pregnancy as she was very good in communicating with me and was clearly explaining/reasoning things. She allowed my husband to join during in-person consultations at her clinic (following covid safety protocols). During appointments, she gave us ample time to consult, answered all our queries and never rushed us. She gave me good advice on prenatal diet and exercise routines. The part that I appreciate the most was her availability on WhatsApp and her quick responses (for simple questions I had at random times).\n\nShe was straightforward in communicating potential risks at different stages of the pregnancy. She was also receptive to our opinions and reasoned with us for what would be best for me and my baby. I delivered exactly at 40 weeks. I didn't get natural labor pain and I wanted to wait, but she explained clearly the risks of waiting beyond 40 weeks and convinced me that going for induced labor pain was the right thing to do. Her motto for delivery was \"Healthy mom, healthy baby\".\n\nFrom my first appointment, I was clear that I wanted to try for a normal delivery and she was supportive of it. During delivery, I had an episiotomy but I also had an uncontrolled tear which led to significant blood loss. I'm thankful for Dr. Namrata and her labor room team to quickly identify the tear, take corrective actions and prevent further complications.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Namrata as your obgyn!",

I was diagnosed with oligohydromnios where in amniotic fluid was less than normal range and on top of it I got infected with covid.Based on good reviews in google and Practo, we contacted Namrata ma'am for second opinion of high risk pregnancy. we are glad to have come in contact with doctor. Our first interaction/consultation with doctor was very good and without any second thought we decided to go ahead with Namrata ma'am for pregnancy treatment and delivery.Doctor is very empathetic and friendly, listens to problems patiently and incredibly understands. She takes time to explain and never once we felt she was rushing.  We discussed possibility and reasoning with all her time and she never denied to answer any of queries we had. She followed up on regular basis and ensured everything is good. she is also very quick to respond on texts or calls at whatever time it may be. We were rest assured Namrata Ma'am is taking care of everything in the pregnancy treatment.Doctor has the positive approach to treatment. For instance with less amniotic fluid and covid, she comforted us and ensured we were stress free. Did not recommend unnecessary scans and tests. She gave the treatment with immense care. On the day of delivery, I had the feeling my water broke at starting of 39th week of pregnancy at around 12:30 in the night. Doctor responded immediately and asked us to come to hospital. Doctor visited regularly every 2 hours and encouraged for normal delivery. As I was not able to bear the pain, I requested for cesarean but doctor remained positive and hopeful of normal delivery. At 10:54 am I delivered a baby girl through normal delivery with ease which in my weirdest dreams I had not thought will happen. We are fortunate to have come in contact with Namrata ma'am for pregnancy treatment. *** ** ****** *** **** ******** No words to explain her dedication and pampering she does to patients. Thanks a lot Namrata ma'am for everything. Doctor is highly recommended.",

She is methodical, extremely receptive, she believes in right to information and most importantly she is decisive in all her actions. I had an extremely complicated pregnancy with Sub-chorionic hematoma, High NT score, GD, GHT, Liver issues, pre-term labour etc etc and even more complicated delivery- 24 hours of labour, normal pushing and then rushed to the OT for C-Sec- AND in all this she stood by me like a rock, never for once let me lose hope and always encouraged me to think positively. She was thorough with all the tests she made me go through and superbly confident in the way she meted all the treatments. I was truly lucky to have her as my Obgyn! She did not give me unnecessary medicines like most doctors do these days and rather encouraged me to get my daily nutrients from food. It was always a pleasure to go meet her because of her sweet disposition and the care with which she would listen and answer each one of your questions ( my baby always kicked when she heard her voice!! ). Dr Namrata even helped out in getting all my blood tests done at home ( due to the pandemic ) which as a pregnant patient was very helpful ! I wanted a normal delivery for which she was extremely supportive- she let me go through 24 hours labour as I requested and even got me to push but then she took a decisive call to do a c-sec only after all doors had closed for normal delivery- she did not push me into surgery like most doctors do. She stitched me up so beautifully as well ! I healed in a week and you can barely see the scar !! So if you want an Obgyn who tells you the way it is, go to her - follow her and get the best out of your pregnancy and delivery ! ",

After many searches and first consultation, we chose Dr. Namrata Nagendra as our permanent gynecologist. Being APLA positive, I had a high risk pregnancy. Every time we sat with her for consultation,  she cleared all our doubts and my unnecessary stressors. The pregnancy progressed smoothly under her care. Even the exercises and diet prescribed by her helped me in controlling my weight and gestational diabetes. Any doubt i had, maam would clear in WhatsApp messages. She insisted that husband should be in the labour room which is what I have always wanted. Moreover I wanted a normal delivery.  Namrata maam was sure to make it happen. My husband was more confident and ready to be with me in the labour room after all the classes taken by Namrata maam. He and maam gave me the boost throughout the delivery without epidural. Towards the end,  head was not positioned properly and cord  was round the neck.  But Namrata maam was super confident that she got the baby out once fully dialated. We are blessed with a normal healthy baby girl and NICU was not required. Everything happened as per God's grace and because of Namrata maam' s expertise. \nSo, maam will be my permanent gynecologist as long as I am in Bangalore.  My husband and family are super impressed with Dr Namrata and trust me, you will never have second thoughts with her as your doctor. \n \n ",

She explained things so patiently and answered all my questions, ordered a few tests for both my husband and me and even shared her number with us, it was as simple as forwarding my test results to her. She is extremely accessible, just a message away. 3 months later, I messaged her my positive pregnancy test results and she had me come over for a consult and explained everything that I needed to do, to ensure my pregnancy went as smoothly as possible, and thankfully it did. My visits with her were something that I'd really look forward to, she is always so patient and spends as much time as you need with her to answer all your queries, unlike other doctors who are always in a hurry to finish a consult and see the next patient. she's like a friend who listens to all your problems so patiently and cheers you on especially during your pregnancy when your hormones are totally whacked out. My pregnancy went on so smoothly with no hiccups and she ensured that I got my tests done in a timely manner so everything could be kept at bay. Any query or doubt would be answered through a message, so that was super convinient. Dr. Namrata and I were both on the same page when it came to my birthing plan, we both wanted me to have a normal delivery and she made sure that, that's what she delivered. My delivery was as smooth as it could be and my labour pains lasted a mere 5 hours, she managed my pain really well and I can't thank her enough for the beautiful delivery that I had, she delivered my 3.6kg baby boy normally  and it was exactly how I wanted it to be.  I would recommend Dr. Namrata to everyone looking for an OBGYN, she's extremely warm, easily accessible, no waiting time during an appointment, spends as much time as you need with her, regularly checks up on you through messages, cheers you on during your low downs and mostly she becomes your friend through the end of it all. Thank you so much Dr. Namrata for everything you've done for me, if I ever decide to have my second child, you'll certainly be my only choice. \n",

I think Even if complications would've arrived, I'm sure we would've tackled it with Dr. Namrata by our side. \n* Followed everything that Doctor advised and it helped us a lot. \n* Patience that doctor kept during delivery is appreciated not only by us but within my circle of friends and family. \n* Doctor was keen on Normal delivery whereas my wife had given up due to labor pain and was asking for c-section delivery. Doctor had belief on the data i.e heartbeats of baby within womb and blood pressure of my wife, which were monitored throughout the labor and were perfectly normal.\n* Doctor's words were very encouraging during this time and my wife was convinced for normal delivery. We delivered a healthy baby boy!! Jyoti is recovering well too!! \n\n* To be very honest, we have not seen any doctor like Dr. Namrata Nagendra. \n\nMay be some of the words above are coming out of over joy but we achieved this joy because we followed doctor and doctor followed us at every step. The synchronisation between us was phenomenal which came because of the cognitive empathy that Doctor possess. \n\nA big Thank you to Doctor although we can't thank her enough!! \n\nHighly recommended Doctor!

I was more than 100Kg that time and she was the person who gave me confidence that it could be a healthy pregnancy if I could maintain proper diet. She broke the myth that during pregnancy one has to gain weight and can not lose weight. I started following her diet plan and lost almont 5 Kg within 3 months. Throughout my whole pregnancy she strictly maintained my weight. That was why I had a pregnancy without any complication. It was she who gave me confidence that I can have normal delivery. It was just out of my imagination that I can try for normal delivery. But her every word motivated me so much that I was mentally prepared for normal delivery by my 3rd trimester with the help of proper diet and exercise. Then my delivery day came. I was in labour throughout the night. She replied to my massage even at 1am during my labour. Again she visited to see me at 5am in the morning. And when delivery time has arrived she again came at 6:30am. Because of her warmth I felt that she was like my mother. Finally with my utter surprise I had a normal delivery and gave birth of a healthy baby boy. Even from the very next day she made me walk and climb stairs as well. Thank you is the small word in front of her efforts. Highly recommend her. One can blindly trust her for a helthy pregnancy and delivery. Much love Dr. Namrata Nagendra. ",

Thats exactly what happened to me. \nI chose Dr. Namrata after reading her reviews. I went to her with Diabetes , yet she did not discourage me to get pregnant. We worked as a team and got the sugar readings under control. I followed whatever she said to the T and in exactly 20 days, I had conceived. Yes, it was that easy only because we had complete faith in her. The moment the pregnancy was confirmed, she said \u2018Your Next 9 months are mine\u2019. \nIt was a high risk pregnancy with high sugar readings, not the best of BMI and yes Covid- which drained me emotionally- doctor was just a message away. \nNot many women of my age prefers vaginal delivery - for the obvious reasons. But I strictly wanted a Vaginal Delivery. Dr. Namrata\u2019s Track record says that she promotes Vaginal birth. She mentally prepared me, made me do pre - natal yoga(Mommy and Me has certified Pre Natal classes- I highly recommend Yogini Meenakshi ji), encouraged me to walk, have quality time with my husband( she asked us to hold hands and go for evening walks :) ). The entire pregnancy I had gained only 9 kgs.Thats how strict Doctor is! :)\n\nWhen my water broke, from then till my delivery which is 22 HOURS of labour, Dr Namrata was right next to me, holding my hands, waiting for the cervix to dilate. You would only see it in movies!  I told her to fulfil my dream of a vaginal delivery and SHE DID IT.\nShe was the first who got to know I was pregnant, she was the first to make me hear the heartbeat, she was the first to hold my baby,She is equally a mother to my daughter and that, for any mother is a very big thing to say.I was discharged on a Sunday and the next day I was washing clothes. Thats how smooth my Pregnancy was.\n\nVaginal Delivery- I knew I would do it, but I didn\u2019t know I COULD do it.-\n\n- Aahana Banerjee\n\n",

It felt like she was part of this whole journey with me like a family member, because I met with her every two weeks, consulted over phone for even the smallest of doubts and she would patiently address everything. She takes her time with patients and not once will you feel like your time is up, she will go through all your questions and concerns and calmly address everything. She\u2019s superbly up to date with practices, trends and behaviours and somehow always knows what to do. \n\nI went in with borderline sugar, blood pressure and thyroid issues which she tackled through the course of the pregnancy making sure my body is ready and capable enough to deliver normally when the time came. Finally, in the labour room, she was perhaps the only one confident on a normal delivery when even I had given up because of the contractions and the way my labour progressed. \n\nWith Dr. Namrata, you get a doctor, diet consultant, advice from a mother and a friend all in one. She also never dispenses with prescriptions for medication unless absolutely necessary and never makes you get unnecessary tests or make lab visits if not needed - I think I went through only 2 or 3 Dolos through the whole course of the pregnancy besides my vitamin top ups. If there is a better way to deal with your health issues such as through exercise, yoga or diet, she will herself guide you and help you find a plan that works for you. She senses your state of mind, your motivation to do or not do certain things and can talk to you at that wavelength. I continue to consult with her for post-natal care and will continue to for all my regular gynaec consultations - I have been extremely extremely lucky to find an obstetrician like her during my pregnancy and I would blindly recommend her to anyone looking for Gynaec or obstetric consultation for what ever issues small or big. Especially during these COVID times, it was an absolute blessing to have a doctor like her by my side. ",

She has successfully guided us through two pregnancies and they\u2019ve been a smooth ride thanks to her clockwork-like-appointments and regular follow through.\n\nHer holistic approach to care ensures well rounded outcomes. Speaking specifically about pregnancy and childbirth experience, Dr Namrata not only gave medical advice but also encouraged us to adopt healthy physical AND mental lifestyles. She\u2019s also one of the few Doctors who understands and appreciates the power of counselling. A detailed counselling session ahead of childbirth on postpartum blues and depression was extremely helpful. I wish more medical professionals dabbled with the mental wellbeing aspects like she does.\n\nAll in all, as you can tell from all the other raving reviews here, she\u2019s excellent at what she does. Trust her to provide the best possible care for you and you\u2019ll go back healed in more ways than one.\n\nThanks so much Dr Namrata, for being SO good at what you do.

She was very patient to answer all my queries in each appointment. She was very quick to respond to my queries on whatsapp as well.\n\nShe encouraged me for normal delivery from the start (which was my preference as well). She followed a holistic approach to manage my pregnancy, which included prenatal yoga, continuing physical activity/workouts and following a healthy diet.\n\nBefore the delivery, she ensured that I was not only physically ready to deliver, but also mentally ready. She explained to me the reason for each of her decisions for delivery before I went to labor. During labor, she checked up on me multiple times and helped me feel positive. During the delivery, she was superb in managing both me and the baby. I can\u2019t thank her enough for what she did for me.",

Visited for menstrual irregularities, and through regular scans was diagnosed with a fairly large ovarian cyst. \n Dr.  Namrata was kind to explain the various lines of treatment and was very patient to explain the pros and cons, to help me make better, well- informed decisions, as a patient. I admire the fact that Dr. was open to work with me on all available  lines of treatment, and not impose one over the other and rush me into making a choice. \n Her first approach was to make specific lifestyle changes which was incredibly helpful advice, however owing to the size of my  cyst, routes of planned/ unplanned surgeries were also offered, eventually. I underwent a cystectomy surgery successfully with her.  I cannot thank Dr. enough for not only diagnosing my issue timely but offering her support through and after surgery, with utmost care ! \nI appreciate Dr. Namrata for being friendly, open to hearing concerns, offer options that we\u2019re comfortable to adopt and most importantly for her humane approach.

She encouraged us to try for vaginal delivery the moment my wife conceived- something unheard of in many medical facilities. Her guidance in formulating the meals, scans, medicines and exercises every three weeks, then two and lastly days nearing the due date were pivotal in keeping me us on track. My wife hadn\u2019t had much idea being a first time mom, so she  \u2018listened\u2019 to the doctor as the pre-natal yoga expert advised. It\u2019s necessary to trust and question when in doubt. She clears all the doubts patiently. Being a mom isn\u2019t cake walk, but it wasn\u2019t a Herculean task when in right hands. Dr. Namrata wasn\u2019t my find, I heard from a friend who too had a vaginal delivery. Today watching my daughter turning a week old and hearing my mother\u2019s traumatic hospital experience, I am grateful to have her. Even my mother agrees! \ud83d\ude01",

She did a thorough check of my existing medication and has never suggested any unnecessary medicines / tests. Mine was a high risk pregnancy with type 2 diabetes, and cervical incompetence. With the cervical stitch, I had to be on bed rest and she did her best to make me comfortable with the sudden change. She always advocated for normal delivery. Due to complications, I underwent C section wherein she ensured I was up on my feet within a day despite the immense pain (in hindsight this was the crucial element for me to start the journey of motherhood independently and with confidence). She has always been patient with our questions (and we have had loads for each consultation!) and approachable for any concerns. Would highly recommend Dr Namrata for anyone starting their parenthood journey!",

We decided to trust her and blindly follow her advice and that has been the best decision ever.\nShe practices the rare combination of western medicine with thoughtful suggestions on maintaining overall health with lifestyle practices ranging from yoga, diet etc to minimise medications.\nShe is probably the only doctor I\u2019ve ever met who educates the patient and lays down every possible option/consequence with utmost detail. Her friendly demeanour and family like advise led us to this day where we are blessed to have our baby girl all healthy and hearty next to us in exactly the way we imagined it.\nI wouldn\u2019t have possibly been able to achieve the birth experience I wanted without her by my side in my most vulnerable moments. She ensured my husband also got to partake in every process of this journey, which is not just rare but truly special.\nWe as a couple owe our beautiful experience to Dr. Namrata and are wholeheartedly indebted to her for making this a memory of a lifetime.",

I went around meeting a lot of doctors but was never happy with either their wait time or they just weren\u2019t approachable. My sister referred  Dr.Namrata to me so I went to meet her. The first visit I knew I wanted her to deliver my baby. She was extremely warm and welcoming and most importantly she is very approachable. Being my first pregnancy I had a lot of doubts all the time she was really kind to answer them. I had a complication in my pregnancy and at that time she was extremely supportive. My scan was done at 12:30am and she was even available at that time. During my delivery also I had given up and said I want a c section but im so grateful and thankful to Dr.Namrata that she encouraged me through my 22hr labour and made me have a normal delivery. Also I only gain 9 kgs in my pregnancy and lost 7 winthin a month after birth, she always kept a tract on my weight and my health also. \nReally happy and grateful to have met her. \n ",

I\u2019m so thankful that I got to know about her at the right time and the first time we met I had confidence that we are in right hands. The way she talks and approaches by handling every situation is amazing. She doesn\u2019t only provide you medical guidance but also tell how to handle things socially and how to manage other things and not stress out. She had been my stress reliever too I must say that. She is so friendly and is always available to respond to you on Watsapp. Also she will not provide unnecessary medicines and will treat on only what is really needed. \n\nShe made my entire pregnancy journey so good and my delivery process as well. My husband was in allowed in labor room too which gave me more courage to deal with NVD process. Since I delivered early morning she was constantly in contact with hospital staff and as soon as she arrived I delivered within 5mins. Seeing her in labor room also gave me so much strength and confidence.\n\nAll in all I must say she is the best best gynaecologist and highly recommend to all couples trying to conceive or moms to be to if you really need to be right hands then it\u2019s her. Her experience and skills to handle each and everything is amazing. You meet her once and you will know why I\u2019m saying this. \n\nThank you Dr.Namrata for everything\u2026 you were like an angel to us..",

Frankly speaking, when we decided to meet her for the first time, we were not sure if she really will provide the care and treatment for normal delivery. I say that because I have heard from multiple people regarding deliveries in Bangalore hospitals about how normal delivery is a dream and how they mostly end up with C section. But all these doubts were clarified when we visited her and she herself encouraged us for normal delivery after understanding my wife's health history. There on we decided to continue with her for rest of the medical care process until delivery. Her professional and emotional blend in dealing with a patient is what I love about her.Another great quality of her which I want to highlight here is that she will not ask a patient to take any unnecessary medications or irrelevant scans.Additionally, I will mention that she does not give up in any situation and is confident about her decisions. We almost gave up in labour room when the pain was unbearable for my wife. We decided to opt for C section and informed the doctor but fortunately she was extremely positive about normal delivery and she managed to convince us to stick to the initial plan. This was unexpected that the patient was asking for a surgery but doctor was convincing to go for a normal delivery. She did a beautiful job and hence I highly recommend her to the couples who wish for a normal delivery of their baby.",

But then we visited Dr. Namrata after seeing a lot of great reviews on the internet, and right after the very first consultation with her we knew that she is the Doctor we were looking for, and all the good things people said in reviews about her were absolutely right. During every consultation, Dr. Namrata spent enough time with us explaining things in detail sometimes even multiple times until we understand them well, she has been very polite and talked with us as if a mother is talking to her baby. \nThe doctor always supported us and guided us for the normal delivery. Even in the labor room the doctor visited multiple times and waited for the normal delivery to happen, and finally it did..\nShe never wrote any unnecessary tests, and answered every single question we had. Throughout the pregnancy, the Doctor took very good care of us and we are so glad that we could find Dr. Namrata. Thank you so much Doctor for everything.",

She talked me through all the possibilities and concerns and explained everything very clearly. I found her very easy to talk to and her approach towards patients very friendly and felt well assured that am in safe hands.\nPost conception throughout my pregnancy she was very patient with us. She explained everything in detail and did not push or enforce any unnecessary tests on us. Her focus remained on lifestyle changes like yoga, diet, walks etc rather than medicines. She was approachable and was available over call and text for all our concerns and queries. Since we planned for normal delivery she ensured I did everything to get me there.\nEven in the labor room she was with us for nearly 4 hours monitoring the baby heart rate and mitigating through all complications so I can have a normal delivery.\nShe is very confident, ************** practical, friendly, transparent and honest. I am greatful to have her as my OBGYN during my first pregnancy and would highly recommend her to others as well.",

She has done the proper counselling about the normal delivery just few weeks before my delivery to make us confident. She has taken care of every small things and informations for the same. On my delivery day she stood by my side continuously and with her guidance and treatment I could deliver my baby just within 3 hours through normal delivery. \nI would like to recommend Dr Namrata Nagendra to all without a second thought ******* *** ** *** **** ************* ****** ********* ***** \n\nThank You \nTwarita & Prashant \n",

She clearly explains the options you have at every stage of pregnancy and delivery very patiently.The waiting time at the clinic was always less than 15 minutes. She does not prescribe unnecessary testing or medication. I had gestational diabetes which was detected during the third month of my pregnancy, Dr. Namrata strongly encouraged me to manage it without medication. She is extremely patient and  is approachable on text and is open to clarifying your doubts . She encourages vaginal delivery and delayed cord clamping. She made sure that I could hold and feed the baby immediately after delivery. She ensures that the hospital staff provides the best possible care.In spite of having personal commitments on the day of my delivery, she was there throughout my labour and delivery and helped manage my pain and anxiety best. She encourages the partner to be there during the birth process. My husband and I express our gratitude and thanks for bringing our daughter into this world in an uncomplicated way! ",

About one and a half year ago, we went to a big branded hospital chain and were shown to one of the most rated doctor there, but they only kept us running here and there with multiple tests that didn\u2019t even point out the underlying health issue\ufffc my wife was having. Her condition worsened, and a day came we had to rush to somebody reliable. I started looking for A doctor close to our house with a good reputation. After doing research, we came to Dr. Namrata. She could guess the issue in the first visit itself and gave a very minimal and very accurate test that immediately confirmed the treatment. Without wasting any time, she started the treatment accordingly, which also included a major surgery. \ufffc Within three months, my wife was cured. She is alive again. \nDr. Namrata is an excellent doctor (rather a savior for us) and also very serious about her profession. \ufffc\n\ufffc",

This pregnancy was the most precious for us given the history of our genetic problem and multiple miscarriages. The journey through this pregnancy was a roller coster ride which Dr. Namrata made so smooth. At 30 weeks I was tested Covid positive and I could reach out to Dr. Namrata so easily. She continued to check on my health. The second challenge was breach position of my baby. Dr. Namrata suggested a wonderful physiotherapist and successfully I had normal delivery.  \nLike this there are many things to share. Dr. Namrata managed every new challenge of my pregnancy (my age, gestational diabetes etc) so well. \nOn the whole..  I would say.. she is a very dedicated gynecologist with modern outlook and  who also believes in traditional ways to carry through the pregnancy and delivery. Dr. Namrata spends great amount of time with patients and explains each and every information meticulously. She is a very friendly, supportive and approachable doctor. \nOne rarely gets such experiences. Doctors like Dr. Namrata matters a lot especially when journey is not so smooth. \nI would strongly suggest Dr. Namrata. It was the most memorable time. Thank you Dr. Namrata. \n\n",

She is a pro in normal deliveries and knows very well how to prepare a mother mentally and physically for that advising diet, yoga and medicines as required. She is very clear in her communication and keeps the expecting mother well informed. She prefers to prescribe very less medicine and limited number of scans, unless absolutely required. She knows the subject very well, so her treatment steps are well planned. We luckily got in touch with her from the pre-pregnancy/planning days, and then on never had a second thought. \nPlanning, Pregnancy, Delivery and Post Delivery is a journey, we are happy to have her by our side as a caregiver. We were blessed with a baby girl in July 2022 perfectly fine and healthy. It was a normal delivery and hospital discharge time was pretty less. She is highly recommended consultant for anything related to Obstetrics/Gynecology.",

(And I did have a normal delivery)\nDr.Namrata is honest and gives you the pros and cons of the tests that has to be taken, things that have to be followed during the period and doesn\u2019t judge you for the path you choose. You are guaranteed a comfortable conversation with her  regarding any and every concern and the best part is that she is available 24/7 Incase there is any questions you have or any emergencies!\nSo if you\u2019re looking out for a doctor who will help you with a normal delivery (until and unless it\u2019s medically impossible) your search for a good doctor ends here!",

We were excited and determined to have NVD, but our first consulting doctor scared us that it was a high-risk pregnancy. As it was unsettling, we started looking for a second opinion, thankfully we landed at Mommy and Me Clinic after reading about Dr.Namrata Nagendra.\n\nShe is not only a Doctor, but for me, she has been a constant source of positivity and care throughout the journey. All my myths and dreads vanished during our visit to her, though I was obese she gave me the confidence to have a normal delivery. She set goals for me during each review in terms of diet, maintenance weight, and exercise for me to maintain a healthy and low-risk pregnancy. \nHer approach was always humble, and her recommendations for scans and medicines are effectively planned. We were educated about each and every scan, and method involved during the delivery process. She is easily reachable on WhatsApp for any query and all the concerns are addressed swiftly. \nShe was there with me from the first pain of labor, until I delivered after 24 hours of labor. We can't express how grateful we are to Dr.Namarata for the normal delivery of our baby girl!\nOur journey with her became more beautiful and comfortable.\nWe highly recommend her for people leaving in B'lore, for all the gynecological issues, pregnancy, childbirth, and especially NVD. Thank you, Doc!\n\nAmit & Roopali",

We got to know about her from one of our friend then we started consulting her. She is very friendly and discussed each and every problem related to me n baby and also explain us things in detail that\u2019s the best part which you never see in big hospitals doctors doing so,  always there is a  rush. Best part is she will create a WhatsApp grp where she is always available to give any kind of questions answer also. \nMain thing is my journey of pregnancy was bit critical in 1st to 2nd trimester , after NT scan we got to know our baby is IUGR , which is related to growth restriction which may lead to preterm delivery , but she is the one who took care of my diet and lifestyle like yoga and all which leads to baby\u2019s growth and also she was never in the favour of C-section. After 7 and 8 months growth scan we got to know our baby is doing well and I am ready for vaginal delivery. It was an unimaginable journey for us and ya here is the result we are blessed with a healthy baby boy. \nShe is an amazing super lady.\nKudos to her!!",

We loved the way she spoke and explained things to us on way forward we both liked her in 1st go and we thought if every doc is like her it would be great experience for all the gonna be Mommies post this experience we started meeting her on a regular basis as per the appointment and she made us more comfortable and educated us every time about new things of pregnancy and told us all the advantages and disadvantages of every stage of pregnancy and probably the only doc I have seen who never spoke about cesarean and always encouraged to go for a normal delivery and as she preached she made me deliver a beautiful baby girl in a normal way. This is my beautiful journey of pregnancy which was made easy by Dr. NAMRATA NAGENDRA and I would recommend this doctor anytime and how ever far you stay in Bangalore I would recommend you to meet her and take your decision.",

Following her guidance on maintaining a diet plan, limiting weight gain, actively monitoring existing ailments and maintaining regular activity is something that she recommends to ensure you undergo a normal delivery. Trust me, she will strive and do everything in her way for you to undergo a Normal delivery, nevertheless complications are always an exception. \n\nI had a normal delivery but a tough one, with more than 7 hours in labour, tired and on the verge of losing hope of a normal delivery it was Dr Namrata who pushed me to not give up, she ensured I keep trying as she believed I could do it. Today I\u2019m a proud parent & I thank Dr Namrata for believing in me and guiding me through a healthy pregnancy and child birth process. \n\nPregnancy and child birth are not limited to a mother, the over all process is for both parents and my husband I believe is the luckiest to have experienced the entire process of child birth thanks to Dr Namrata. He was well equipped with the required information & knowledge. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr Namrata for all your gynaecology needs. \n\nHanaa & Nabil",

After first meet, the way she started treatment, made us to realise we have a doctor in family.\n\nWe can contact this Dr anytime any day with any questions, she is just a message away.\nInitially we had a plan to move to native for delivery, but the kind of treatment we received from Doctor, made us to change our decision to stay back here only for delivery. \nFinally on feb 15 Blessed with baby girl. \nWhole delivery process was so smooth and it was normal delivery. \nWe never bothered or confused for a minute during this 9 months about anything just because we are a patient of Dr Namrata. \n\n\nShe\u2019s a very patient person who genuinely cares about  patients. She has always taken time to explain things to me in terms that I can understand.\n I would recommend Dr. Namrata, anyone seeking a kind, compassionate, and brilliant doctor!\n For best result,  we must follow her suggestions blindly.\nI just pray, let God give her more strength to serve all who comes to her for a treatment. \nThanks a lot doctor for everything.",

So, we decided to go ahead with her, and that was the BEST decision of our life. From the onset of my pregnancy, to my delivery, further to my post delivery healing - everything was seamless. Her knowledge, expertise and professionalism is impeccable, and I will always remember the calm and friendly way she answered all my apprehensions and queries every time I had a visit or on the WhatsApp group amongst 3 of us (my husband, Dr Namrata and I)  ...Also, I managed to have a normal delivery when no one in my family thought I could - quite literally, all the credit goes to her for pulling this off. She had visited the hospital (5 times in a day) herself to monitor my status, and ensured that my husband and I stay motivated and calm throughout the process.\nMy heartfelt thanks to Dr Namrata for giving us our bundle of joy, with an equal focus on my health as well. My strongest recommendation to go ahead with Dr Namrata without any hesitation or qualms to say the least.. :)",

She is extremely friendly, explains tests, problems and solutions in detail. Gives you the pros and cons of anything that she does or suggests we do. Unlike a lot of doctors who suggest one test after another even when it's not required, she suggested only those which were and asked us to avoid other tests, which at times we thought we might need but we were wrong. My wife was diagnosed with ICP, and the doctor was able to identify it in good time. Even though ICP could lead to birth between 32-35 weeks, the doctor helped us make the baby reach her 38th week which helped towards the development of the baby. She was always available through what's app for general queries and we didn't need to go to the clinic for every single doubt we had. She herself took the initiative and followed up regularly with us on the phone which gave us a feeling of personal involvement. I would certainly recommend her to any other couples who are pregnant, and I'm sure you'll have a good 9 months with doctor Namrata.",

In the first meeting i knew that she is the best for me. She guided me very well throughout the pregnancy. Her diet plan, exercises, friendly nature and prompt reply on whatsapp kept me anxiety free and positive throughout the pregnancy. She made sure that all my doubts were cleared and guided me very well in prenatal classes. At 32weeks i got to know that my baby is in transverse position but Dr Namrata along with Dr Shazia helped me and with little effort and exercises my baby turned cephalic. I was in labor waiting for normal delivery but due to some complications Dr.Namrata suggested that we should go for c sec for the safety of my baby. I'm thalassemia minor with very low hemoglobin but she kept in mind all the complications and without any blood transfusions required i delivered a healthy baby via c sec after 38 weeks. After delivery also she is very supportive and still helping me throughout in my new journey of motherhood.",

She helped us with guidelines to conceive well and within a month we were pregnant. It was in no way a simple pregnancy and Dr Namrata guided us through all complications with regular follow ups and well rounded advice. She suggested timely scans and check ups and helped us get in touch with experts on urology and hematology at appropriate stages and diagnosed the complications well in advance for us to have a full term and healthy child. Her sound advice and friendly nature gave us confidence throughout the process. Even post the delivery, she strongly has advised towards a healthy recovery and her advice is working wonders already. We thank her for all her help and guidance and would very strongly recommend her to anyone and everyone who is looking for a brilliant ob-gyn.\n",

We visited her and in first visit itself decided that we will go ahead with Dr. Namrata for rest of our pregnency. We faced number of issues during our entire pregnency including short cervial lenght, complete bed rest from 4th month onwards, gestational diabetes, difference between baby weights (30%), reduced amniotic fluid for one baby, low birth weight (1.5 KG) for one of the babies and many more. She did fantastic job in handling all these with great precision. Since my wife was on bed rest, she gave us first appointment early in the morning, and was always sharp on time. She got us a very good natured person to pickup all the samples for various tests at home, helped us arranged physiotherapist in her clinic itself so that we don't have to travel much. She ensures to redirect you to appropriate consultants in case any issue needs special attention, like we were referred to consult endocrinologies for treating diabetes as it wasn\u2019t controlled through diet and she didn\u2019t want to take tablets which will have impact on baby. One of the things I would like to specially mention is she is available on whatsapp for any queires, and her responses are like real time, we never had to worry about emergencies. Last but not the least, she would ensure you understand the problems and its possible outcomes and risks in depth, and would suggest best possible way forward considering your opinion. I feel privilaged that there are such professional doctors whom you can completely rely on. With her friendly nature, our high risk twins pregenency journey has been promising. She always said positive words during each consultation and kept us motivated to move forward with concious decisions. \nThanks a lot mam for all the support and help, you have gone above and beyond all the responsibilities of being a gynac to ensure our pregnency is successful. No words for your dedication, Thanks a lot !!! _/|\\_",

In our initial visit itself at 5 week pregnancy, the other Gynecologist got so many unnecessary tests done and even an early pregnancy scan. We had a total\u00a0bill of around 12k. Then we found Dr. Namrata and I am so happy to have had her as my doctor. \nDr Namrata is so precise and apt with the tests she recommends and medicines she prescribes. When we met her, she was very friendly, listened to all our concerns and told me that we will aim for normal delivery, prepared a diet chart for me and pushed me to do walking daily. We created a whatsapp group also where we used to coordinate\u00a0for regular consultations. She always used to reply me in case I had any queries. Having her as my doctor gave me a lot of confidence.\nWe wanted a doctor who would guide and listen to the problems as everything was new to me. And she was exactly that and even more. For important scans like NT and Anomaly, she did counselling and explained in detail what to expect from each scan. Also recommended\u00a0good Doctor as it is important to get them done from an experienced doctor.\nFrom 7th month, she took few\u00a0delivery\u00a0counselling\u00a0sessions for me and my husband. In that she explained all the stages of labor, what to expect in hospital and in delivery room , about epidural, complications which might happen and when do they\u00a0generally go for C-section as last resort.\u00a0She motivated\u00a0us a lot for\u00a0normal delivery which required me to be active, do walking, prenatal yoga, pelvic and breathing exercizes and maintain healthy\u00a0diet. She helped a lot in all of these aspects.\nAt the end, when my labor started and we got admitted to the hospital, she was there for us and finally I had a normal delivery under her supervision.I am so happy to have found her as my doctor. * **** *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** ********* ************** ***** ********* ********",

I initially went to Dr Namrata for my pre conception counselling and she guided us, eventually I was pregnant within a month but things didn\u2019t go as planned for us but Dr Namrata not only guided us with the best diagnosis but also handheld us throughout till I got pregnant again. I recently delivered a baby girl on November 10th and I can safely say that the entire experience was smooth and practical which is the need of the hour. She is unlike a lot of them in the practice and she genuinely will only prescribe what she believes is the right course. I\u2019ve been to atleast 5 top gynaec in Bangalore and I\u2019m pretty sure no one comes close to Dr Namrata. She\u2019s available on WhatsApp 24x7 for any enquiry which is a huge consolation for patients. She will patiently reply to every silly question. I am and will be eternally grateful to Dr Namrata for all her guidance.",

She is an exceptional doctor, who takes care of each of her patient like a family member. \nThe initial part of my pregnancy was going smoothly, until I started with pre term contractions at week 32. The doctor was prompt to act and managed to stop the contractions timely.  I finally gave birth naturally at 36 weeks and the doctor was constantly available throughout the labour. \nI also loved the fact that she doesn\u2019t prescribe endless medications and scans. She is available to answer your questions on whatsapp and calls. \nI will definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a ob/ gyn .\nThank you Dr Namrata!",

She always wanted us to do things as much naturally as possible without inducing prescription based medicines. She always says not to overspend money and try changing food habits/physical activities.

She made us, as first time parents, feel very much at ease.\n\n Since the day we got pregnant we were under the guidance of Dr. Namrata.

No unnecessary medication or tests were done. She was always available on WhatsApp for any doubts or queries. The consultations at the clinic are managed very well with minimum waiting time.\nOverall very happy with her support throughout the pregnancy \ud83d\ude0a",

I tried to follow each and every suggestion given by her and thanks to her my delivery was vaginal. She doesn\u2019t prescribe unnecessary medications which is the best thing.

My wife was going through Hyperemesis Gravidaum 3 weeks post first detection of pregnancy. This involved incessant vomitting and just lots of mental and physical pain. Without Namrata supporting her and guiding her through it I have no idea how my wife could have fought through it for the 13 weeks of horror that it was. She\u2019s been well since, again thanks to doc\u2019s treatment methodologies. Namrata was super proactive in ensuring my wife was fine and always delivered solutions to any problems that came towards us. We are grateful to have found her and in about 2 months we will be having our first child and Namrata has been gunning for a normal delivery. Words can\u2019t describe how much I owe Namrata for my wife\u2019s wellness both mental and physical.",

In the last few weeks of pregnancy she helped me stay motivated when my dilation was progressing quite slowly. On the day of my delivery, she was present throughout to keep a check on me. There were some complications during labor and Dr Namrata scheduled an emergency C section in hardly 10 minutes and I delivered a healthy baby boy all thanks to her quick decision making. Would highly recommend to all. ",

She advised us to take injections every alternate days so that each of us should take 10 injections each. Advised some blood tests for vitals. The good part was my wife never had any issues throughout her delivery and had a healthy pregnancy. We delivered a baby on 14th Jan 2023. Really thankful to Dr Namrata Nagendra. She is very approachable and upfront. Explains her entire thought process and lays out a roadmap to keep plan B ready.

From our first prenatal check up to the birth of our baby, We have only had positive experiences. \n\nHere is why: Dr. Namrata is extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, kind and friendly. We felt at ease with her from the beginning. We have met several excellent Gynecologists, bet she is by far one of the most caring, friendly, down-to-earth and egoless doctors we have ever met. We can always reach her by Phone/WhatsApp, even if you miss the appointment, she will follow up.\n\nGo for Dr. Namrata if you are looking for the best gynecologist who is knowledgeable, patient-friendly, communicative, straight forward, doesn\u2019t prescribe unnecessary testing and not too long in the waiting room.\n",

As this was my First pregnancy I was really worried for many things but she was so helpful and understanding, which actually made my pregnancy a smoother one. She is so encouraging and full of positivity. From the time of checkup till the time of delivery she was very friendly and supportive. She is a good listener and explainer. She never attended me in hurry, she gave her full time in listening to my problems or doubts and solving them. Most importantly she was available at just a finger tip. She never ignored my messages and queries. I almost had given up during my delivery but she was the One to stand beside me and encourage me for my normal delivery. I am really Thankful for her for such a great gesture towards me throughout my pregnancy. ",

Dr Namrata firstly addressed my frequent UTI issues, didn't have one post that.Thereafter coming to my pregnancy, I consulted her from day one of my pregnancy (naturally conceived), she walked me through my pregnancy with ease, no unnecessary tests and scans were ever done and encouraged me for a normal delivery. She addressed all my questions and was always available on WhatsApp in emergencies. And finally, I had a normal vaginal delivery with Dr Namrata's assistance and blessed with a healthy baby boy.I'd recommend Dr Namrata and happy with my choice! Thankyou doc!",

During my 1st pregnancy I was suffering from HB deficiency, but in the 2nd pregnancy due to proper treatment from her (dr Namrata) I was able to manage HB Level and was active through out the pregnancy.She had given strength and hope for Normal delivery but due to medical problems, we went for C Section.

From gods grace we found Dr Namratha Nagendra. She was very very helpful. We went through IUI treatment and Yeah! become pregnant within 2 settings. It was twins. But for our bad it was heterotrophic pregnancy and we almost lost our hope. It's extremely rare, where one baby is in tubes and the other is in the uterus. But Dr Namratha was very supportive and she removed the baby from tube and other baby was some what safe but didn\u2019t leave the hope. She treated me so well. After few months cervix length got decreased to 1cm and got cervix stitch and finally had a normal delivery with a healthy baby. I would like to Thank Dr Namratha Nagendra for all her support on our 9 month roller coaster journey. Without her help it would have been a dream. Thank you so much. She is always available when we need the most.",

During 8th month pregnancy we were tested positive for covid, she made sure that we didn't panic and helped us get thru it.\nShe is always reachable, if not over call she  always makes sure to respond on WhatsApp.\nWhat I liked most is that she encourages  husband to be involved in each and every step of pregnancy.

She included my husband at every step to help me. Even my questions or concerns outside of visits were thoroughly answered within minutes. \n\nBefore long, I knew I was in safe hands. I trusted her completely. When the labour started, Dr. Namrata was patient and confident, assuring me that I'd be able to naturally deliver a healthy baby, which I did. \n\nI can confidently say that my positive birthing experience was possible only because of her knowledge, experience, and dedication.

During peak COVID she consulted with us via video calls and explained everything to us. \n\nClose to the delivery date she took care of all our vaccinations and she made sure we went ahead with a natural delivery. She is so dedicated and hard working and takes so much care of her patients.\n\nWe are blessed with a healthy baby boy and even after the delivery Dr. Namrata is so caring and keeps checking up on baby and mother. \n\nApart from being an excellent doctor she is a phenomenal human being and we consider ourselves extremely lucky to have met her. Thanks for everything doc! You are truly an example for all upcoming doctors! I wish more doctors were like you!\n\nThanks again :)\n\n",

From the first consultation to the delivery the complete journey was amazing.She is a highly skilled, confident doctor. I wanted normal delivery and she tried everything to ensure that. She gave easy access , I could reach out to her anytime through WhatsApp and her response was prompt. She is so confident, I was very nervous in the labor room , she came and within 20 mins the delivery was done. What a doctor she is !! I would highly recommend this doctor.She is the best.Thank you Ma'am for this wonderful experience.You are truly a wonder woman!",

Me n my husband trusted her with full of my heart and since it was my first delivery I was scared but it happened smoothly because of the support I received from her.. She is always available to answer queries on whatsapp. Anytime I had questions she immediately responded which was the best. She will also routinely check up about the health.. Which i dont know if any other doctor will do.. Remembering all the patients and giving them proper attention is difficult but here I didn't feel that.. I got all the attention I required. ",

To put it simply - Dr Namrata is not only extremely abled, she\u2019s also very approachable and speaks to you like an equal. It is common, unfortunately, for Doctors to get irritated with all the questions patients sometimes throw at them. With Dr Namrata, we\u2019ve never been in that position. She understands that at the end of the day, patients ask so many questions so that they may gather all the necessary information and cope better. To that end, she was always open to conversation. \n\nShe was also super accommodative with appointments and met us regularly to stay on top of the situation. She guided us through the process in a manner that was easy to understand. We\u2019re super glad we found her and would whole heartedly recommend her to anyone. Thanks for everything you did for us Dr Namrata, you made this ride the smoothest! ",

From day 1 I have been guided and trained for Normal delivery which included on time diet, exercise, vitamin medications and vaccine. She is very good when it comes to follow ups. she used to take regular updates on my health and baby moments and suggests for visits for check up when ever required. On the last month of my final trimester I have having high BP and almost lost hopes on normal delivery, but on time medication by Doctor, regular follows and visits helped a lot on delivery day to conceive normal. I highly recommend her for pregnancy or any ginac related issues as she is very transparent, supportive, and very good in follow ups with her patients. She is a great Doctor whom you can rely on and have a complete trust. ",

We had consulted another doctor in HSR Layout (who we didn't like much and wanted more involved experience) before consulting Dr Namrata, who was suggested by one of my friends who was already consulting Dr Namrata.\n\nDr Namrata was thorough in all her examination and always pushed me to get prepared for a normal delivery. This is something that helped me quite a lot. She was always available on whatsapp to answer any queries that we may have as first time parents to be. \n\nShe has a very friendly nature and that eases things up and allows one to open up.\n\nI would highly recommend her to everyone.

She is one of the most friendly & trustable doc I have ever come across. \nI wanted to have a normal delivery but since I had little bit of complication during my pregnancy we might had to go for c-section.. On the day of labor Doc was the one who pushed me to deliver the baby normally. I gave my 100% & had a normal delivery, at the same time she encouraged me to do so.. \nI would definitely recommend Dr. Namrata for all those ladies who wants to be in safe hands.",

We were in a difficult situation where due to Covid most of senior doctors in the top hospitals declined to touch the patient or their previous medical records. While my wife had concerning issues in first trimester, we were desperately searching for a doctor who can guide us on treatment and give us some emotional comfort. Thankfully, we went to Dr Namrata who has not at all hesitated from doing anything required from day one. From then till delivery doctor has completely supported us even if you need her in odd hours of difficulty. The doc has all the qualities of good Gyne to sail you through the period as she not only understands medical condition but also advises you other things like in our case for my wife how to manage the long office hours. She would clearly define your does and don\u2019ts at times very strictly but all for your good. ",

We just have to follow the advices she gives and follow strictly.Throughout the pregnancy she was available anytime and any day for emergencies and basic queries.I trust her blindly and can say she will give you the best advices and home remedies wherever possible,spends as much time as you need with her, regularly checks up on you through messages, cheers you on during your low downs and mostly she becomes a doctor, family ,a friend and name all the beautiful relations in our life and she will be that for you.

She also keeps the expecting parents well informed about every step during the pregnancy helping them to make informed decisions. \nDr. Namrata didn't only keep us updated with the physiological changes to expect, but also emotional changes which really helped me cope with any self doubt or guilt during and after the pregnancy. \nHer expertise, responsiveness, and genuine concern for her patients puts her up at No.1 Gynac for me. Definitely recommend seeing her if you need one. \n\nPS: She might be able to give pretty good fashion advice too! ",

She has only recommended scans/tests/medicines which are necessary. My pregnancy journey experience went very smoothly. She was present in the labor room throughout my labor pain and handled me patiently. She went out of her way to help us during the overall procedure. Even she came to see us as long as I present in the hospital and enquire about my health as well as my baby's health. \nWe both are very much thankful to Dr. Namrata for all the efforts she has taken for our successful pregnancy journey.\n",

She puts in her best foot forward to ensure normal delivery and in my case had it been any other doc, I mostly would have ended up with a c-sec.

She was sensible enough to rule out possible causes for the problem and then move to next steps. Most importantly, she has an open thinking.Polite, listensed to my concerns / doubts and gave clear answers to the same. Very few doctors welcome doubts over messages, and she was kind enough to at least respond to the necessary questions post consultation, regarding the test reports, which is certainly something that a patient would appreciate. No wonder she has a 100% rating. I would continue with her as my gynaec.  ",

It was for my mother. Dr Namrata took the time out to examine her, explain to us the scenario in great detail and suggested the future course of medical action (surgery) needed. Once we had decided on the surgery, she went out of the way to help us meet the scan/lab testing and other logistical challenges the lockdown threw at us. She performed the surgery, it went well and we managed to get back home earlier than expected. Thank you doctor and I would strongly recommend Dr Namrata for anyone looking for an OBGYN.",

Though I was scared about it but she made it easy till I delivered. She is a best gynaecologist and a best person too . She is very friendly in nature , you will not feel any lack of guidance throughout the pregnancy. My pregnancy journey was so smooth and comfortable with her guidance. She prescribed very less medicine which needed only .Always she is reachable by phone and whatsapp .When I was in active labour pain then she just completed the delivery within 5 to 10 min and it was smooth delivery . She encouraged me and support me also when I was loosing confidence due to pain. I will suggest the normal vaginal delivery want to be couple or any want to be mommies please visit once to her , you will be satisfied and confident in first visit only. Thanks a lot Doctor Namrata for supporting throughout our journey. ",

Thankfully we met the right doctor at the first place itself. She explained each and every detail to us and answered every query what we had . She listened to us patiently and help us with this journey. \n\nUnfortunately , this was not a healthy pregnancy and we had to go with medical termination. Doctor helped us understand the procedure for D&C and gave us the assurance that everything will be alright. \nThe day of procedure and I was in OT and pulses were high. As soon as I saw my doctor, I was relaxed and procedure went smoothly. As mentioned  by her earlier , everything was smooth in OT and post procedure I was feeling okay. \nPost that , we visited doctor with Biopsy reports, again she pointed out the reasons what were mentioned in Biopsy and gave us the guidance on how to proceed further. \n\nOverall, it was best to experience what we had with doctor and situations like this , you have lots of queries and ask why this happened. Thankfully we had the right doctor who guided us in the entire journey. \n\nWe will definitely go back to her when we start to plan for 2nd time. ",

She listened to all my concerns, and explained me all the reasons that might have caused them. She explained what the treatment would be like, the pros and cons.

She suggested how I can make a few realistic changes in my lifestyle and live a healthy life. And how can I not mention about the moral support that she gave!

She is very down to earth and made the entire process right from the day I started consultation for my pregnancy to the birthing process and even post delivery a very beautiful journey. It usually seems very intimidating but Dr. Namrata made it very easy and made the whole thing seem so comfortable for me. \nProfessionally I really loved how she had the patience to explain each and everything because I know a lot of doctors in the industry who don\u2019t. She even recommended I use a Birth Doula, named Shaziya who made the whole birthing experience more relaxing and comfortable. \nI strongly recommend Dr. Namrata to all the Moms and Moms to be.",

She showed complete professionalism right from the consultation phase, making sure to explain every minute detail regarding the problem and procedure, made sure to clear all of our questions and establish trust. The surgery was efficient and as planned. My mother showed speedy recovery and the doctor made sure to visit the patient regularly for check ups. For follow ups, she listened and advised as needed. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Dr. Namrata will definitely be my preferred gynaecologist and I\u2019ll recommend others to consider her without second thought.",

I had very mild signs of PCOS and she suggested methods that are natural lifestyle changes and some that include medications and let me make the decision of what I wanted to follow. Definitely recommend visiting her, especially if you're a young adult seeking professional and honest treatment with zero judgment. ",

As soon as we took appointment with her she asked us to create a Whats up group. Any questions or apprehensions that we had we were posting on the group. Believe me or not she would reply in 15 - 20 minutes. When we went to meet her she used to take all the time out to explain all the queries that we were asking. Most of the time that we have gone to meet her we were getting the appointments in few minutes. The waiting time to meet the doctor is also less. Most importantly she will give the first  preference for normally delivery. And lastly during our Baby\u2019s delivery there was a sudden hiccup which she managed successfully. I feel she is the most accessible doctor. ",

During the 1st meet itself i was rest assured that i am in the right hands and all the reviews seemed genuine.\n\nI wanted a Normal Vaginal delivery and from day one she guided me very well with the diet plan, exercise etc to be followed and finally i delivered a beautiful baby boy on 23.10.2021 and it was a normal vaginal delivery.\n\nShe guided us through the pregnency and was always a text away. She is very supportive and is giving me advice even post delivery for healthy recovery and to keep me anxiety free.\n\nHer sound advice and friendly nature gave us confidence throughout the process and it is because of her that i could push myself for a normal delivery.\n\nWe thank her for all her help and guidance and would strongly recommend her to everyone as she is brilliant.",

All throughout she has been not just my doctor but also a friend who patiently  addressed all my big and small queries. One of the things I really would like to highlight is how friendly she was in understanding my anxieties and helping me cope. In the last 2 years I have met so many different gynae in Bangalore but none had the time and patience to sit down and explain things. Dr Namrata understands that as patients you will have queries and she's always open to answering those. All our appointments were comfortable and well advised. Even as I went into a pre term delivery, Dr Namrata calmly guided us on what to expect and the steps. She gave us so much confidence during this time keeping both the mom:s and baby's health top priority. We are so glad to have found her at the right time and can't recommend her enough! Thank you, my super doc! ",

I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and she provided all the information required to keep my blood sugar in check, checking up on me regularly. She was always available on WhatsApp, this helped me get all my questions answered and helped calm me down throughout my last trimester. She provided detailed answers and took time to explain everything.  I chose elective c-section due to the baby\u2019s weight and she guided me really well through the decision making process. Her support and advice post-delivery has also been great. I\u2019m very thankful to her for delivering my baby safely. Overall, I would recommend her to anyone looking for an empathetic doctor who provides great care and support.",

Dr Namrata was the only one really familiar with it, even told me she can treat it! Talking to her was easy, and she explained to me all my options really well, (convincing me to explore the less expensive options first, even though I was clearly desperate, ready to try absolutely anything suggested!).I signed up for the procedure, and it went all well. she did her best to ensure the costs don't shoot up unnecessarily. she also followed up with me regularly herself. Never seen anyone do that. Thank you :)For all those of you looking for a good gynecologist, someone easy to talk to, knowledgeable and friendly, she is your doctor! ",

She is also very much available for any question you may have during each step of your pregnancy. ",
