The day we visited, shweta mam her  friendly nature and the way she took care of our case personally meant alot. She made sure we were relaxed and helped us throughout the process. With the confidence she gave we were able to enjoy the last few months of pregnancy. She made sure the doubt was clear and her positive aura made our journey smooth. And with help of shweta mam, normal vaginal delivery happened and the baby was also safe and healthy. We are really glad that we found her on our journey and we felt heartly thankful to her.",

That reflects our overall experience with the doctor!\n\nWe have chosen the hospital(Ovum Hospital, Kalyan Nagar) with my friend\u2019s reference for our 2nd baby consultation and delivery. After going through all the doctor\u2019s profiles, we decided to go with Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri. In fact, it was my wife\u2019s preference. However, we were not sure if we had taken the right decision as we never met her before. After the first consultation, we felt really comfortable and confident. The doctor is very friendly and approachable. We are basically from Tamilnadu and we preferred a Tamil speaking doctor. She helped us feel comfortable even in that aspect. The periodic consultation and diagnosis went very well based on her guidance. The baby\u2019s growth and mother\u2019s health condition were well monitored. Talking about the baby\u2019s delivery, considering the baby's health condition, it\u2019s decided that we need to do the delivery by C-Section. Initially we planned to do the delivery in Week-38. Everything planned for surgery as required. On the day of surgery, I was confused with the questions\u2026 is it too early? Will there be any health issues for the baby? etc., I decided not to do it now. Let me wait for another week. With hesitation, I messaged her saying we don\u2019t want to go for surgery today. I was worried if she would get angry at me for changing the plan at the last moment. But, she called me and politely said that there is nothing to worry about, take your time to decide. She was very cool and professional in handling last minute change. I was really surprised and very much thankful to her. Later, we planned the surgery considering the auspicious day and all that. The baby delivery process went very well as planned. My wife was very comfortable in the labour room. She entered the operation theatre with a smile\ud83d\ude0a and came out with more smile\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. I was the one sitting outside with a tense mind! We are blessed with a cute baby girl!!!\n\nI would like to mention about the room booking also. We are eligible for the executive room only for the insurance that I hold. But, the hospital agreed to upgrade to a Premium room which is almost the same as the executive room, not much difference. But, I requested a Deluxe room which is a much bigger room. But, the admin team said there are no Deluxe rooms available. But, the day I came for admission, we were allotted the Deluxe room because of Dr\u2019s recommendation. I am thankful even for that.  \n\nI am the kind of a person who asks more questions. She clarified all my doubts patiently. Truly professional! Tons of thanks to Dr. Swetha and the hospital for the support throughout the journey!!! ",

That reflects our overall experience with the doctor!\n\nWe have chosen the hospital(Ovum Hospital, Kalyan Nagar) with my friend\u2019s reference for our 2nd baby consultation and delivery. After going through all the doctor\u2019s profiles, we decided to go with Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri. In fact, it was my wife\u2019s preference. However, we were not sure if we had taken the right decision as we never met her before. After the first consultation, we felt really comfortable and confident. The doctor is very friendly and approachable. We are basically from Tamilnadu and we preferred a Tamil speaking doctor. She helped us feel comfortable even in that aspect. The periodic consultation and diagnosis went very well based on her guidance. The baby\u2019s growth and mother\u2019s health condition were well monitored. Talking about the baby\u2019s delivery, considering the baby's health condition, it\u2019s decided that we need to do the delivery by C-Section. Initially we planned to do the delivery in Week-38. Everything planned for surgery as required. On the day of surgery, I was confused with the questions\u2026 is it too early? Will there be any health issues for the baby? etc., I decided not to do it now. Let me wait for another week. With hesitation, I messaged her saying we don\u2019t want to go for surgery today. I was worried if she would get angry at me for changing the plan at the last moment. But, she called me and politely said that there is nothing to worry about, take your time to decide. She was very cool and professional in handling last minute change. I was really surprised and very much thankful to her. Later, we planned the surgery considering the auspicious day and all that. The baby delivery process went very well as planned. My wife was very comfortable in the labour room. She entered the operation theatre with a smile\ud83d\ude0a and came out with more smile\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. I was the one sitting outside with a tense mind! We are blessed with a cute baby girl!!!\n\nI would like to mention about the room booking also. We are eligible for the executive room only for the insurance that I hold. But, the hospital agreed to upgrade to a Premium room which is almost the same as the executive room, not much difference. But, I requested a Deluxe room which is a much bigger room. But, the admin team said there are no Deluxe rooms available. But, the day I came for admission, we were allotted the Deluxe room because of Dr\u2019s recommendation. I am thankful even for that.  \n\nI am the kind of a person who asks more questions. She clarified all my doubts patiently. Truly professional! Tons of thanks to Dr. Swetha and the hospital for the support throughout the journey!!! ",

I met her she said pt is healthy and she got all the necessary tests done to make sure everything is fine. the reports said pt had Thyroid High and Vit Low. So she immediately gave the necessary tablets and she made sure she cross checked everything just to be on the safer side which I really appreciate through doctor personal number also she guided whenever we had doubt without hesitating, not every doctor would take that extra step. She didn\u2019t warn patient about anything she said all you have to do is eat healthy and be normal like & enjoy pregnancy.\nIn the third trimester after scanning from other daignostic source they said baby growth is less, We felt very sad and my wife were crying, After consulting the doctor, (She made clam with her words and made us to feel better that baby is Tiny (Very Small) but this not big issue no need to worry, Once baby come out of mother womb, Baby will grow as normal),\nshe suggested we could go for induced labour but I obliged. She neatly explained the pros and cons of a delivery. Then At 37th week had delivered a baby boy on Jan 2023. Doc was on time and she didn't visit her clinic on that day, Doctor were staying in the hospital whole night and day. Doctor allowed me to be inside the Labour room along to be beside with my wife, so i had an idea of what was happening around me. She kept talking to me and patient updating about the health condition throughout the delivery i felt so relieved. I trusted her completely. \nThen came post partum she made sure she changed some supplements and she even suggested on what should eat and she kept a tab on iron levels by getting my blood tested. \nSo be it pre or during or post pregnancy she was there throughout journey with the same enthusiasm. I would definitely recommend her because she\u2019s such a professional.\n\nDr. Swetha Vinjamuri is working in OVUM HOSPITAL, We got some reveiew about the hospital is not well Just because of doctor practising in that hospital only we had visited the hospital, Hospital atmosphere is very neat and clean, Nures will treat the patient well, But before one discharge some of the nurse will not care about the patient, Package we too is 65k but it went to till 1lakh for Normal Delivery for both patient and baby, Hospital is not keeping promising prices at least they have infomring bill going beyond the package, Apart from that everything went well\n\nSome doctors are like heroes of our lives who saves us from the misery of pain, Being in a hospital is a terrible experience, but Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri will with her caring and extra effort make the patient comfortable is truly remarkable, Her great explanation of the patient illness give them hope for the postivie things\n\nI\u2019d give her a 10 on 10 for her professionalism and the way she deals with situations. She\u2019s one amazing doctor and a person.",

Her compassion and professionalism made the entire pregnancy experience smooth . My wife (32 years old) got pregnant with a gap of 8 years from the first child. Dr.  gave full confidence to make sure my wife can do a normal delivery and gave proper consultation throughout the pregnancy. Dr is always active and approachable where she is open to attend calls from us and provide the guidance whenever needed during the pregnancy. I never saw her showing the attitude and we felt like she is kind of family friend.Also she can talk in all south languages, Hindi, English including tamil, which helps my wife to communicate and clarify doubts clearly. On the day of delivery it took almost 7- 8 hours in the labour and the Dr was full supportive to make sure for normal delivery. Thanks a lot for ensuring a safe delivery for our precious baby. Dr is Really an expert in normal delivery and encouraging the natural birthing process (Note: My wife followed the instructions like Diet , Exercise, medicine properly as per Dr advise)  ",

I would happily suggest her name and have already done for few of my friends who are her current patience as well.\n\nNow she told me what is right what is wrong without any hesitation and regular check-up and scan was advised, throught this journey both my husband and I were confident and comfortable with her.\n\nIt was a normal delivery for me and the labour duration was just 2 and half hours, she was there checking on me from the start till the end.\n\nSo anyone who is reading this review i would say just trust her, she was the best for me and I'm happy that she was my doctor.\n",

From the very beginning, Dr. Vinjamuri was not just a skilled medical professional but also a friendly and supportive presence during this crucial time in my life.\n\nOne of the standout qualities of Dr. Vinjamuri is her unwavering support and motivation. There was a point during my pregnancy when I felt like giving up on the idea of a normal delivery and opted for a c-section. However, Dr. Vinjamuri believed in my ability to have a normal delivery and motivated me every step of the way. Her confidence and encouragement were instrumental in making it happen.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, she was always there to address my concerns and answer my questions. Her expertise and knowledge were evident in the way she explained things to me, ensuring that I felt informed and empowered to make the best decisions for myself and my baby.\n\nDr. Swetha Vinjamuri's compassionate and caring nature made the entire pregnancy journey a positive and memorable experience. I felt genuinely cared for and supported, which is something I will always be grateful for. Thanks to her dedication, I was able to achieve the normal delivery I had initially hoped for.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri to any expectant mother seeking a gynecologist who not only possesses exceptional medical skills but also provides the emotional support and motivation needed during this transformative period in one's life. Dr. Vinjamuri truly goes above and beyond to ensure the best possible outcomes for her patients.",

My journey was bit difficult to reach the right doctor on time. I was into my 3 trimester when I decided to change my initial doctor and visited Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri.  \n\nBefore visiting her, I heard lot about her from my relative, and than I viewed her profile in practo, which gave me a confidence that she is the one who can help me during my last trimester. My decision was absolutely correct, from the 1st day till the end she took great care of me, with regards to my health and issues that I was facing during my pregnancy. \n\nIn the hospital as well all the staff says that, She is know for her normal delivery than c-sec. \n\nIt was proved when I gave birth to a beautiful girl child because of her. She was my support and strength on the day when I was admitted for delivery. I MUST SAY: ALL MY LABOUR PAINS SUBSIDE WHEN SHE SAID I'AM WITH YOU, YOU HAVE TO BELIVE IN YOURSELF AND NORMAL DELIVER IS POSSIBLE.  It was normal deliver, and today I feel blessed.\n\nAm so happy and proudly say that, She was a god for me and she can be a god for anyone. \n\nThank you so much Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri.\n\n ",

Without doctor's support and efforts I wouldn't be able to successfully deliver my baby vaginally. \n\nI am very happy and thankful to Dr. Shwetha V for her support during pre and post delivery and I highly recommend her.",

Dr. Swetha was extremely patient with us throughout our pregnancy journey, she was always available to clear our doubts and provide virtual consultations over phone during emergency situations. \n\nBe it pre/during pregnancy or even delivery, she guided us with natural methods, which made us fully confident with her consultations. In my case, during the labor procedure, there were complications due to the baby's head position. Inspite of many unsuccessful attempts, Dr. Swetha and her team never gave up and continued to encourage me by making me try different exercises to change the baby's head position and have a normal delivery. \n\nI am thoroughly satisfied and happy  with Dr. Swetha's expertise and professional approach in  concluding my pregnancy journey successfully.

When I went for check up during my ninth month of pregnancy, she analysed my condition and baby's breech position inside my womb and suggested for a c-section. I delivered baby on the same day and myself and baby are fine and healthy now. Dr. Swetha Vinjamuri's wise suggestion on that day has made me escape the biggest risk. Her treatment during delivery and post delivery is superb. ** ***** ***** **** **** ** ***** *** ******* ",

She is a wonderful doctor who listens to the patients patiently and prescribes a comfortable treatment. The best thing about her approach is that she doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines unlike other doctors. A friendly person by nature, she encouraged me to go for normal delivery and never even once did she sound doubtful. Her estimations and methods were so apt that I successfully delivered normally. Even after delivery, she has been helping me cope with recovery.\u00a0Dr Swetha is an optimistic person and that's what made my experience so pleasant and memorable.

In my case, Before due date i got contraction at midnight and i contacted her, she immediately responded and she instructed me to check-in when the contraction comes for every 5 mins and i was admitted to hospital.\nMe and my family thought tht i had to go for c-section as my baby weight was 3.5 kg mentioned in recent scan report but she treated me so well, best part is she encouraged me to go for normal delivery and kept me motivated throughout and finally i had a normal delivery.\nI'm truly satisfying and would gladly recommend her :) much thanks to her i delivered healthy baby boy..:)",

She always made sure she checked my thyroid levels, sugar levels and blood pressure throughout the course of the pregnancy and never neglected even a slight deviation in the readings. Towards the end of my pregnancy as well, just before I delivered she explained the delivery process and made sure I was comfortable at every point. Thank you so much doctor, we are ever so grateful!!",

I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to Dr Swetha Vinjamuri. Being our first time, we didn't know what to expect, but Dr Swetha helped us through the process. She is very responsive and very patient and very kind. \n\nShe speaks English, Telegu, Kannada and Tamil actually. So we were able to convey all our apprehensions without any issue and she patiently answered all our queries. She has a smiling face which is what really boosts your confidence!\n \nWhen I was insisting for a C section because of the pain, she patiently helped me understand why normal birth would be the right choice. Actually I love the Doctor\u2019s Friendliness throughout the journey.\n\nBoosting confidence is next level even pre delivery OPD times and even in the labour delivery time. I recommend visiting Dr Shwetha. 10/10 experience :)",

But the way mam supported , advised and handled my entire pregnancy period was really appreciated. She was always available over phone whenever I had any doubts or concern. She is full with positivity and encourage us in our every single visit. The main thing I would focus on is I had a very long painful labour and being so tired and exhausted at the end I cried for c-section . But that time mam came and remind me the very first conversation I had with her in my first visit that \"don't loose hope. You came to me me seeking for normal delivery nah. You have to stay strong\"..... Those words really helped me to gather my strength. I would really like to thank mam from bottom of my heart for not loosing hope in me and helping me delivering my boy.... ",
