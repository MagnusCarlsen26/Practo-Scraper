Our gynaecologist recommended Dr.Sumana.\n\nMy first impression of her was a calm, confident and practical person. She was very patient in explaining the treatment and very realistic about the success rates. She told things as is without any sugar coating this helped us to be prepared mentally.\n\nWhen we started with the treatment we had regular scans for the doctor to assess if there was any use in progressing further. This made me respect her more cause she was thinking about the patient.\nMoreover my ovaries were precariously placed but Dr. Sumana\u2019s efficiency ensured I had no complications.\n\nToday after one failed IVF and a successful FET am pregnant. I thank God for helping me meet the right doctor. I thank Dr.Sumana for all her patience and guidance throughout this journey.\n\nI would strongly recommend her to anyone who is seeking help in getting their family extended.",

She was very patient in explaining the treatment and very realistic about the success rates. She told things as is without any sugar coating this helped us to be prepared mentally.\n\nWhen we started with the treatment we had regular scans for the doctor to assess if there was any use in progressing further. This made me respect her more cause she was thinking about the patient.\nMoreover my ovaries were precariously placed but Dr. Sumana\u2019s efficiency ensured I had no complications.\n\nToday after one failed IVF and a successful FET am pregnant. I thank God for helping me meet the right doctor. I thank Dr.Sumana for all her patience and guidance throughout this journey.\n\nI would strongly recommend her to anyone who is seeking help in getting their family extended.",

And its the success in 2 nd attempt.\nwe are blessed with baby boy  4 month back. we are really thankful to Sumana mam.she suggested/guided us to make right decision.She is the best one to consult if you are waiting for joy to coming in your life.\nI am really happy with the nurses and caring staff service.\n\n\n",
