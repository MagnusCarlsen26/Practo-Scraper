I am so grateful I chose her. She took care of me how exactly I thought a doctor should be. Her love for her work and patients is so evident in the way she treats them. I am lucky that I chose her and my daughter had seen her first. She will always hold a  special place in my heart not only becoz she helped me delivered my baby but the way she took care of me after delivery. Even when my C-section scar opened up due to my negligence after six months, she told me nothing to worry. She gives me this amazing confidence and I am so glad that I can\u2019t thank her enough.",

And with few beginning consultations Dr.Chaya Patil has met with our expectations, as she is having 20 +years of experience, very kind, polite and have great patience to hear our issues. Throughout our experience Dr.Chaya Patil was very caring especially at labor room and post delivery. Baby had passed meconium but she was patient and waited for the normal delivery to happen. Really grateful to ma'am who patiently waited and encouraged for normal delivery. She Never prescribed any unnecessary medicines or unnecessary scans and tests . Our family is really thankful to Dr .Chaya Patil .",

Her experience and exposure is vast. My baby had turned head down bit not fixed it's head. I was so concerned. She doesn't panic or scare. She waited, she didn't induce and i had a normal and very peaceful delivery. I and baby are doing great and happy.. My sister in law and other friends are consulted her as well. Five stars, hands down. ",

She left for home as my delivery was not expected that day. But once she came to know that I was about to give birth, she came back to hospital in no time.
