We started our journey in January 2023 after reading positive reviews on Practo and Google. Choosing her as my Obstetrician-gynecologist was a great decision. \u201cAn open heart and a skilled hand make the best Doctor\u201d. She is supportive, patient, and really listens to our concerns, offering guidance and counselling if necessary. \n\nIn January 2023, I visited Divine Women\u2019s Healthcare Center for best opinion on my first pregnancy. Unfortunately, due to cardiac anomalies, we had to consider an abortion. Maam explained everything in detail and supported us through the difficult decision. \nUnfortunately, my second pregnancy also resulted in a missed miscarriage and I was utterly heartbroken. Dr. Vinutha Maam  reassured me that I could still conceive a healthy baby naturally in the future.\n\nWith God\u2019s grace I conceived again in November 2023 and now I am blessed with a healthy baby girl through Normal/Vaginal delivery. Throughout the journey she helped me to be strong and prepared for the Vaginal delivery. I followed Vinutha maam\u2019s each advice, took prescribed medicines on time, practiced yoga, and maintained blood pressure and sugar levels to achieve normal/Vaginal delivery. \n\nEach visit to the clinic was positive and uplifting. Dr. Vinutha Maam was always available to address my concerns over call or through messages on WhatsApp. *** **** ********** ********* ***** *** ****** ****** *** ******* ****** *** *************\nI am very grateful for the beautiful journey and already I miss seeing her regularly now in the post-pregnancy phase. Once again Thank you so much Maam for making my pregnancy journey more beautiful.\nI highly recommend Dr. Vinutha Maam to anyone seeking an Obstetrician-gynecologist and those who wants to have a great pregnancy journey. You will never regret by choosing her as your Doctor.  ",

I appreciate her compassionate approach, making me feel comfortable discussing sensitive health matters. she listens attentively and addresses concerns with empathy and expertise.

She has been very helpful and encouraging to take care of myself and She filled me with all positivity and helped me prepare myself mentally and physically to come out from the trauma. Thank You Doctor Vinutha \nI highly recommend her to others.",

We started our journey in January 2023 after reading positive reviews on Practo and Google. Choosing her as my Obstetrician-gynecologist was a great decision. \u201cAn open heart and a skilled hand make the best Doctor\u201d. She is supportive, patient, and really listens to our concerns, offering guidance and counselling if necessary. \n\nIn January 2023, I visited Divine Women\u2019s Healthcare Center for best opinion on my first pregnancy. Unfortunately, due to cardiac anomalies, we had to consider an abortion. Maam explained everything in detail and supported us through the difficult decision. \nUnfortunately, my second pregnancy also resulted in a missed miscarriage and I was utterly heartbroken. Dr. Vinutha Maam  reassured me that I could still conceive a healthy baby naturally in the future.\n\nWith God\u2019s grace I conceived again in November 2023 and now I am blessed with a healthy baby girl through Normal/Vaginal delivery. Throughout the journey she helped me to be strong and prepared for the Vaginal delivery. I followed Vinutha maam\u2019s each advice, took prescribed medicines on time, practiced yoga, and maintained blood pressure and sugar levels to achieve normal/Vaginal delivery. \n\nEach visit to the clinic was positive and uplifting. Dr. Vinutha Maam was always available to address my concerns over call or through messages on WhatsApp. *** **** ********** ********* ***** *** ****** ****** *** ******* ****** *** *************\nI am very grateful for the beautiful journey and already I miss seeing her regularly now in the post-pregnancy phase. Once again Thank you so much Maam for making my pregnancy journey more beautiful.\nI highly recommend Dr. Vinutha Maam to anyone seeking an Obstetrician-gynecologist and those who wants to have a great pregnancy journey. You will never regret by choosing her as your Doctor.  ",

Irrespective of my travel distance is 2 hour   in banglore traffic to clinic I have chosen her it's because of trust and confidence I and my family had on her and I was more comfortable getting treated by her than any other gyno near my house or anyone in city.Professional ethics and service mindset makes vinutha madam standout in a crowd .You can blindly trust her and she is open to discuss anything and everything in calm and positive way .She always thinks in patients shoe and try to give the best she can offer for her patients.Let me tell you the Birth story of Bheem(#mynsecond son name)...When I got to know I am conceived ,there was no second thought other than visiting vinutha madam but travel was challenging because we shifted house recently to other part f banglore which is 40kms away from clinic and traffic will be huge always...but still i made dare to take risk and visited her till  9 months it was all happy and healthy pregnancy till last scan...at end of 36 week vinutha madam asked me for growth scan as my tummy seems to be tiny ...and got to know baby is transverse position and amniotic fluid is less and baby is not growing fastly so she started talking about Plan B if it is not normal but she told not to loose hope till last minute anything can happen if baby supports...if baby is turning will wait till  EDD ...but i was suffering with acidity and was unable to swallow food at end of delivery so i called and told her can't wait more days and it's getting difficult and i will go for c section...she convinced me to wait and the EDD has arrived it was 10th may and no labour pain untill then  so she asked me to admit night and induced pain to me at 11 P.M . Night is full of rain, thunderstorms and lights ...she was continuously checking with duty doctor about my status and early morning my water has broken and she arrived hospital  morning and delivered baby boy normally without epidural ...She won again\ud83d\ude0d I and my family owe her and no words to express our gratitude.These days it's very rare to see dedicated doctor like Dr.Vinutha madam ..Whenever risks in pregnancy, her  attitude of handling things are mind-blowing .If you want  Magic in  pregnancy journey meet Vinutha doctor once :)I wish her success in all future endeavours.Hearful Thanks and Respect from,Arpitha and Raviteja",

She assisted with the delivery of the healthy child by providing continuous monitoring through scans, as I was ICT positive, which had an impact on the baby. She continuously monitored and expertly managed my postpartum hemorrhage during the delivery. When it comes to managing high-risk pregnancies, she excels. Many thanks to the doctor for all of her support and assistance.",

She always focuses on getting normal delivery and makes plan accordingly which we do not come across much in present generation, even my case was little complex during the time of delivery where she did not give up and took it as a challenge and delivered normally for which I would be greatfull and thankful forever.

She is super cool, humorous, simple and does not prescribe unnecessary scans/tests or medicine.\n\nThere are not enough words to describe how thankful we are for our wonderful Normal Delivery. The confidence that she builds during the delivery time is highly appreciated. During last weeks of pregnancy my baby weight and amniotic fluid level started decreasing trend and Dr.Vinutha waits till near due date with necessary monitoring and then takes a decision based on the medical situation.\n\nFinally, we are blessed with Baby Boy on auspicious day Akshaya Tritiya. It was the best decision choosing her as gynecologist. Highly recommended her for pregnancy Journey.",

Dr Vinutha was kind enough to go through my reports from the first and suggest me further. She is not busines minded person. She did not ask me to get tests done unnecessarily. She will guide you with right procedures at right time, she will not overwhelm you with unnecessary stuffs. She explains the options, procedures to the mothers as well as the fathers. In my case since my husband was still out of country till end moment, she was kind and co operative enough to talk to my parents in person and with my husband over call and explain about my health. \nOverall I feel we are completely satisfied and definitely recommend Dr Vinutha.

She explained us the pros and cons of every method of delivery and explained each things in a simple and understandable manner. She gives clarity on all topics and recommends the best possible solution. She was also available on phone and reactive for all the follow ups on constant sugar monitoring. I would thank her so much for being a constant support and care throughout and I would highly recommend her for the most amazing pregnancy journey.

During the 2nd pregnancy, I had an emergency McDonald's cerclage placed by Dr Vinutha in the 19th week but it eventually failed. With this background, this time around Dr Vinutha suggested Shirodkar's stitch in the 12th week. Post that I was completely on bed rest. \n\nApart from the monthly doctor visits, I seldom stepped out of my room. Dr. Vinutha's motivating words helped me a lot during this anxious period. The doctor was always available to answer my queries and concerns over WhatsApp. Dr Vinutha would also encourage me to share my scan/ blood reports over WhatsApp. This helped me avoid multiple trips to the clinic. \n\nIn the 29th week, I got my Growth scan done. Things looked normal and I was happy since the pregnancy was progressing well. Two days later I started feeling a lot of pain in my back. The pain intensified the next day and by the time I visited the hospital, my water broke. Dr. Vinutha immediately administered steroid injections and put me on the strongest possible pain killers. She had multiple plans in place to handle my condition. Intensivist, physician, anaesthetist and neonatalogist were all informed about my case. We were able to delay the delivery by 57hrs. In this duration, I was given 2 doses of steroids and Magnesium sulphate which helped my baby's development. I delivered my baby girl at 29+3 weeks and 41 days later the baby was healthy and ready to go home.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Vinutha for her guidance throughout my high-risk pregnancy journey. The way she handled my delivery situation is truly laudable.",

She is so down to earth and always setting a very positive tone for every patient. God was so kind that they paved the way to Vinutha Mam . It was our second delivery and we moved from Pune to Bangalore on 5th month of our pregnancy .. on our initial reports done in Pune , there were many complications like blood flow was less to baby , amnoitic fluid was less and many more ..with many uncertainty about our pregnancy we landed in Bangalore, me and my husband are in search of a good doctor. After seeing the reviews , we took the appointment with Vinutha Mam , infact I would say Destiny made us to meet with Vinutha Mam.From our first visit , she was so patiently listening all our story and assured not to worry at all and suggested to do very few scans. In our second visit , she ensured evrything is fine and not to worry. I can't explain it was so relieving and Blissful.. we were sure we are in safe hands. For any query and advice , she was just a call or message away .She never suggests unnecessary scans or multiple visit to hospital if everything is fine. She will listen all our queries , infact few are silly , and very patiently replies and clarifies all our doubts and suggests the best. It was so smooth till the delivery, Then as due date was near by she informed all pros and cons of both normal and CS as my first baby was born by CS. And one more good thing is: she is so transparent , she gives the best of advices and we knew she knows the best ,and we went for the one which was best for both baby and mother ..finally the day has arrived and we delivered our baby and there were many complications during the cs due to previous surgery and the Vinutha Mam and her experienced  team handled evrything so smoothly and baby was delivered with no risk factors. \n\nMe and my family are so indebted with her treatment during my pregnancy journey. I highly recommend Vinutha Mam if you are looking for a good doctor for your pregnancy journey. She is so positive , down to earth , transparent and very friendly. During pregnancy , you need a doctor who listens to you patiently and gives the best of advices. She is the one who is like a best friend , a best advisor and best care taker. \n\n This was not my pregnancy journey,  i would rather say an emotional journey for me. Due to many pregnancy uncertainty and few past incidents,  I used to get panic attacks in my last trimester. My husband used to call her and believe me guys no matter how busy she is , she always takes up our call and consoles me. In every visit , she will track my every activities , I wonder how she touches every emotional cord of me and gives the best advise and how to reduce the stress and anxieties. *** ** ********* *** * **** **** *** ** **** The way she handled me throughout my pregnancy journey , a very few doctor can do that. She has all those positive vibes , just a glance of her reduced all my worries and anxieties. I had my last visit with Dr Vinutha Mam, literally I can't forget that day , she examined the Cs stitches and told everything is fine and gave many worth suggestions, my eyes were filled with tears and my heart was wrenching  by this thought that I would not meet doctor in my next visits. I never felt so much warmth , love and care from any doctor in my life. She is a doctor who can be remembered , missed and admired for lifetime.. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42",

                "review_text": "Firstly, huge\u00a0respect for all the doctors. By god's grace and Vinutha mam guidance we have our second child at Cloudnine hospital and its a normal delivery. We have one child of seven years old and also last year I got miscarriage. When I got confirmed about pregnancy from the strip test , I experienced a lot of vomiting and uneasiness and Covid situation was also on the rise,\u00a0tried visiting the previous consultant Gynecologist\u00a0but unfortunately she was not practicing in the hospital. Immediately we searched in the internet about best Gaenocologist near me in google and don't want to delay since there was a miscarriage last time. This\u00a0way we got to know about Dr. Vinutha Mam and read the reviews. It was\u00a0so impressive and,\u00a0then at that instance, we decided to give it a try and gave a visit during the 6th week of pregnancy to the Divine clinic even though it is a little far from my residence. During the first visit we were very impressed because she understands her\u00a0patients very well not\u00a0only just as a doctor, but also as a friend, like a family member she\u00a0cares for them,\u00a0she enquired all our previous pregnancy details and miscarriage etc and clarified each and every doubt we had and then started our journey to have our second child.\nDuring each visit she clarified all the doubts and explained what needed to be done like test/scan/ medicines the best thing in mam is she\u00a0never asked me to do any unnecessary checkups or blood tests or monthly scans. It\u00a0 is done only when required. In my\u00a0second trimester mam\u00a0started with\u00a0vitamins, calcium and iron tablets and asked us to have healthy food to stay healthy throughout our entire pregnancy journey and\u00a0doctor advised us to start with walking,\u00a0yoga sessions from the 5th month of pregnancy.\u00a0During this period of pregnancy, I went through many ups and downs Healthwise\u00a0like had covid positive results, facing high sugar levels, and itching during the third trimester.\u00a0But during this\u00a0stressful time\u00a0all I could overcome due to continued follow up and mam's support, and guidance\u00a0which\u00a0played a crucial role in helping this situation.\nWhen we were in third trimester enquired about the delivery and hospital to choose, then about whether she would be available during delivery etc.,\nWe preferred Cloud nine Hospital, as want mam to be their throughout my pregnancy.\u00a0I was in 39 weeks of pregnancy\u00a0didn't have pain or water break but\u00a0was getting white thick discharge so consulted mam.\u00a0She asked me to get the NST test done from a nearby hospital and send the report immediately. I got the test done and sent the report and everything seems to be fine. Doctor advised me to wait for one more week and get admitted to hospital.\u00a0But after 2 days i.e 17th of August 2022, I was getting watery discharge and\u00a0asked me to come down to cloudnine. So I visited at 11 AM on the same day and mam\u00a0got me admitted and\u00a0The Duty Dr after consulting Dr Vinutha mam broke my water bag and\u00a0induced pains\u00a0and informed me that by night I will be delivered my baby.\u00a0In the hospital the\u00a0Doctor and staff monitored me and then pain started gradually increasing very fast\u00a0and was updated the same to Dr Vinutha mam. As my Labour pain was progressing very fast and By 4 pm I was shifted to the labour ward and\u00a0at last by god's grace and doctor's advice I delivered a baby girl with normal delivery\u00a0on 17th of August 2022.at\u00a04:39 pm. Words are less to thank you mam\u00a0 \n\nIf you are planning pregnancy. I strongly recommend people to visit Dr Vinutha mam.\nThanks a lot Mam for your kind gestures.\u00a0 \n\nRegards,\nSudha & Dinakaran",

                "review_text": "Having Dr.Vinutha B as our obstetrician was a blessing. She is genuinely concerned, cares about her patients not to mention strict when it comes to certain things like exercise and diet. We started seeing her from November 27th 2021 when I was 6 weeks pregnant and met her at cloudnine kanakapura hospital. She accessed me and prescribed folic acid for the first three months and then slowly as I stepped into my fifth month she started talking to me about my protein intake, prescibed calcium and iron supplements and also talked to us about the importance of exercise mainly yoga and how that can help me in having an easy and a less painful normal delivery. She is always thinking about minimizing risks and likes to be informed first hand about anything we feel is not normal and keeps tabs on them. She explains to us as to why she would want certain scans or blood tests done. \nAs we were approaching the final leg of pregnancy - the ninth month she took a call and did a membrane sweep after looking at our reports. What soon started as slight pains in my lower abdomen and groin later progressed into an agonizing ordeal of pain which she told us to keep an eye on and to wait. Eventually the next day at 3:45 am the labour pains had already kicked in and my water broke and my husband took me to the hospital. Being my first delivery I was scared and in a lot of pain and didn't know what to expect. The hospital prepped me and took me to the labour room where the doctor walked in soon after. She came in all confident and reassuring and eased me into accepting the reality of what was about to happen the next half hour. Every consultation we had with Dr.Vinutha from the seventh month was about this moment and she had been very clear about what to expect during a normal delivery. We had a very organic delivery and no pain was induced. She monitored my baby's heart and on her orders I pushed. She made calculated cuts measuring in on the baby's head and told me to push for the fourth and final time. With all my might and energy I had with me, I pushed and pushed and into my docter's hand came a beautiful baby girl who I can now proudly say weighed 3.5 kgs. My pain and exhaustion did not seem to matter when I got to hold her for the first time. Dr.Vinutha was always with me when I needed her and each mother and baby is precious to her. I recommend only Dr.Vinutha for anyone I come across needs help or guidance. In the end I wouldn't change a single thing that happened to me during my delivery and hope to see Dr.Vinutha again in a few years for the next one. Thank you Dr.Vinutha for everything you've done for us\ud83d\ude18. Loads of love your way\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18.\n\nKind regards,\nVeena & Athreya",

Doctor stays near our place so we started consulting in the Divine women clinic from the very first month. Our journey started from November 15th 2021 when I was 6 weeks pregnant. At the very first visit the doctor made us very comfortable and explained all the pros and cons and started with folic tablets. We decided to have a pregnancy journey with the same doctor throughout even if i stay in my mothers place which was quite far of 25kms from the clinic. Doctor used to guide us on food intake and used to clear all our silly doubts.. We used to question her for around half an hour and she used to answer all those without any hesitation. Doctor will not ask to go for unnecessary checkups or blood tests or monthly scans. She thinks our money is her money and asks us not to spend on unwanted scans. She lets us know only if need arises we will go for the scan else a strict no. Best thing about our doctor is that she doesn't give any tablets other than vitamins, calcium and iron tablets and asks us to have home made food to stay healthy throughout our entire pregnancy journey. She focuses more on normal delivery rather than going up for C - section delivery. This was in my mind as i wanted to go for normal delivery and joined yoga sessions as well upon doctors advice from 5th month of pregnancy.\nBest part is I didn't have pain or water break till the 39th week and the doctor advised me to wait for one more week and get admitted to hospital. I got admitted to hospital after completing 40 weeks 2 days. Then doctor met me in cloudnine Kanakpura Road, Bangalore and advised me to go for induced pain. Doctor and staff monitored me for 24 hours and then pain started gradually increasing, actually i was shouting at the top of my voice but even then the doctor didn't lose patience and she made me understand about the situation and at last by god's grace and doctor's advice I delivered a baby boy with normal delivery on 21st of July 2022.\n\nAll the ones who are out there looking for a better doctor, my sincere advice is to visit Dr. Vinutha mam. No second thoughts please. We are very happy with the things doctor deal with and make us more comfortable. We all feel the doctors to be like her and she is the best example and I love meeting her as she has become very close to us in this entire journey.. Lots of love from our family...\n\nWords are less to thank Dr. Vinutha and her staff - Radhika as she is no different and will go the length to make sure all is well.\n\nRegards,\nSahana & Pawan",

                "review_text": "Our story started in Texas, USA. For almost a month, i was having unusual stomach cramp along with sharp back pain. When we consulted our doctor in US, we were diagnosed with an abnormal pregnancy and were on regular HCG count test to track the progress. During this stressful time, we also had travel plans to India which further complicated our situation. During this time, we gave a call to Dr. Vinutha after reading her reviews and the clinics proximity to our house. We were initially worried that traveling from US during covid time, there would be some hesitancy to get an appointment. However, when the doctor spoke to us, she was very calm and understanding. She asked us for the background and made us feel comfortable by reassuring us to come and visit her as soon as we arrive. This made us travel with less worry on our mind.\n\nWhen we reached Bangalore, we visited an other doctor due to an urgency and had an extremely negative experience. The same day evening we already had a scheduled appointment with Dr Vinutha and went to her with all the history and explained our case. Dr Vinutha spoke to us very nicely and explained to us in detail on the options we had in front of us. We sat almost for 45 minutes and kept asking questions, which she answered to our satisfaction. We continued the care that was needed along with lab tests with her. She expedited our lab tests and called us the next day when the results came in and further explained to us that the option we had chosen to wait was the best based on the outcome of the result. Our next lab test was scheduled in a weeks time. \n\nAfter a week, when we visited Dr Vinutha, we asked for an option of surgery since it was more convenient to us based on situations. She again explained to us everything we needed to know and gave thorough inputs on what the surgery would entail. We additionally asked if the surgery can be done somewhere closer since we had another infant to take care of.  Dr Vinutha helped us tremendously by suggesting a few options nearby and finally the surgery was fixed the next morning at 7 am.\n\nThe next day, Dr Vinutha arrived early and comforted us saying that things will be fine and the surgery is a minor one. After the surgery, she explained everything that was done (bilateral salpingectomy) and the circumstances leading to it. She came back in the afternoon to check upon us and kept the spirits high. We asked for a favor to have us discharged the same day and after careful consideration she said okay to that as well.\n\nAfter a week, we visited Dr Vinutha again for the follow up and she removed the stiches and dressed up the wound again. We were checking if we need to visit again, however, she was confident in telling us that things looked fine and we dont have to come back unless there is pain again. She also explained to us to expect everything to get back to normal soon.\n\nAs i write this, things are normal and i am able to go back to my life prior to this whole episode. Dr Vinutha's excellent people skills, communication, empathy, willingness to go beyond to help played a crucial role in helping us navigate our situation. We strongly recommend people to visit Dr Vinutha as needed.\n\nThank you Doctor!\n\n",

Thank you so much\u2026!!  \nOur journey with Dr Vinutha Prashanth started at Divine Women & Child Speciality Clinic in the beginning of Year 2021, it was running 7th year of our marriage life, consulted couple of doctors in the past for medication but no luck. One of my friends suggested me to consult Dr Vinutha Prashanth. We had no hopes before going to mam\u2019s clinic and we thought this is our final try before going to IVF or other higher treatment if it does not work out. Fortunately, we consulted a right person, we are very great full to my friend for introducing Dr. Vinutha Prashanth such a wonderful Gynaecologist near our area and South Bangalore as well. \nIn our first visit, we explained to mam with the past treatment reports/details, and she patiently listened, understand the problem and challenges we have. She started investigating the case thoroughly and diagnosed the issues step by step. Wife conceived in couple of months of treatment starts and delivered a healthy baby without any complications throughout. It shows her right way of treatment in a right time & direction to get wife conceived in couple of months which did not happen in past 6 years from other doctors\u2019 treatment. She is very transparent in explaining the issues that may arise at all stages of wife pregnancy and she is not the one who prescribes unnecessary tests, medicines, or supplements, rather she prefers more of exercises and natural foods, also she avoids unnecessary expenditure by eliminating medications or therapies. \nDr Vinutha Prashant is a wonderful human being who shows utmost concern and care for each patient, many of our doubts she did clarify by WhatsApp chat without fail, it reduces our time & effort in travel, consultation fee is affordable and always she gives value to people not the money, she is very dedicated to her profession, it is very much needed in our society which we saw in her. We have lots of trust and confidence on her which came true, as a name says it is really a Divine World. We are very much happy with the treatment and other services. We honestly recommend Dr. Vinutha Mam if you are planning pregnancy or for routine gynaecological check-up. She is one of the best doctors in Bangalore, the experience is worth. \nMam, - the compassion with which you treat the patients is more effective than any medicine.! May my baby get a great human heart like you and save the world like you are doing. No words would ever be enough to express our gratitude. Thank you for bringing our angel to earth and the safe delivery... \n\nWe pray God that Dr. Vinutha Prashanth mam to reach greater heights in her life! All the best!! \nThank you so much for your help and support. \nWith regards \nNagaraj & Preethi",

My wife was 28+ weeks pregnant at that time .\nWe shared all the history that we consulted  in our native place. she went through all the history and did a detailed check of my wife and baby and assured both are absolutely fine\n\nwhen we asked for scan she said its not required that time  but she does not recommend  for  unnecessary scans and told she will do around 34th weeks .She always insists my wife for Normal delivery and recommended to meditation ,pregnancy exercise .she is always available for the patients .when i say always available its 24/7 just a call or message away\n\nOn 9th month of pregnancy my wife felt a little lesser movement of baby. When we informed the Doctor she immediately asked us to do few scans .After that scan report came Dr vinutha called me and informed there is something in CPR values she worried about .Then she informed me  to admit my wife on that day to avoid any unforeseen circumstances\n\nI clearly remember on 18th March she informed me to admit and without any delay we reached cloud nine Kanakpura hospital and did all the admission process\n\nAround 9:30 PM Dr Vinutha came to hospital and met my wife and assured my wife that  everything is alright no need to be worried for anything .There were  few test done like NST during night\nDuring a nonstress test, the baby's heart rate was constantly  monitored to see how it responds to the baby's movements. The duty doctors/nurses used to continuously report the NST results, vitals etc to Dr Vinutha  & she used to watch carefully the reports  and advise accordingly. She kept in constant touch with duty doctors over calls & whatsapp\nAround 3 to 3:30 AM at the night the we were informed that there is suspicious result of  NST and need to go for  C-section or caesarean delivery immediately\n\nIn midnight a 3:30--:3:45  AM  Dr. Vinutha came to hospital and informed me she will go for emergency caesarean delivery because of suspicious result of  NST\n\nAbout 4:00 AM Dr went to OT and at 4:15 AM in the early morning my baby angel came into the world .\nI was nervous before the surgery but being in great hands of yours has made things much easier. Thank you!\nNo words would ever be enough to express our gratitude. Thank you for bringing our angel to earth\nMy baby is very fortunate to have been born through your hands. Thank you for all the support and care, doctor. I will forever remember your wonderful treatment and care for both the baby and my wife . Thank you for your excellent service. May God bless you.\n\nI will never forget the doctor who always smiles and talks with patients very humbly . Your bright aura brings so much joy and inner healing.\n\nI remember that you used to say my wife ..Jaya !!! its normal\n\nNo words are enough to appreciate the service you do. You as a doctor and the humble person you are .\nThe world would be a much better place if all of the doctors were like you. Thank you so much for everything that you have done.\n\nYou\u2019re such a delightful person and a dedicated doctor, you truly are an inspiration! Stay blessed.",

We started consulting her in April 2021 for my first pregnency. Entire 9 months of interaction with her always gave positive energy to me. For most of my health complaints she used to say \"Prajakta, it's normal\" these worlds never made me worry about anything during that hard time. Mam never asked me to do any unnecessary Scans or Tests. In 8th month I had preterm labour and was admitted in the hospital. That was very defficult time for me and my husband but mam made sure we get enough medical and emotional support from her. My family wanted us to come to our home town for delivery but I wanted to be in Bangalore just because Vinutha mam is here. After this I was all fine and not called her for almost 3 weeks. She herself called me from her busy schedule to check how I am doing and why I didn't call her. I was almost about to cry to see how much she cares for her patients. \n\nAfter 9 months rollers coster ride finally we blessed with baby boy on 1st Feb(full term baby) through Normal delivery. At the time of delivery she was with me in the hospital for almost 7-8 hours and made sure I don't give up and its normal delivery. Mam I am really thankful for this for my lifetime \ud83d\ude4f******** ***** *** * ****** *** *** ** when my Mom came to Bangalore I took her to Mam for gynaecologist checkup in which Mam identified her life threatening illness and guided us for its treatment by referring to perfect doctors. She never said I can't help you, this is not my area of concern and so on.... Every time she made sure we get right treatment for my mother. She saved my mother's life by doing diagnosis on right time. Thanks you so much Mam for saving saving my mother's life. \n\nMam is very dedicated to her profession. She will always make sure treatment you get is THE BEST in very affordable price. I can't imagine my delivery and my Mom's surgery without her. \n\nNow the thought of not visiting her every month makes me restless. We will definitely miss every months visit to her clinic \ud83d\ude14\n\nMe and my family will be always thankful for all the strength and support you gave us \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI recommend Dr. Vinutha Mam very strongly if you are planning pregnancy or have any gynecological issue. *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** ********** No matter which area you stay in Bangalore the experience is worth that travel.\n\nThank you so much Mam \u2764\ufe0f",

                "review_text": "We randomly came across a new women's clinic in our area named Divine Clinic run by Dr.Vinutha Prashanth and thought to check it out for issue with my irregular periods. We were just planning for a baby then. In the 1st clinic visit itself, we were filled with positivity and hope. The doctor confidently said I will conceive within the next 3 months & it happened too! I conceived within 2 months and went ahead with my pregnancy consultations too at Divine clinic itself and had a smooth & safe natural delivery! The labour was an induced one due to my low AFI value and the doctor didn't rush for a C-section. The whole induction process was well explained to me the previous day and taken as slow and natural as possible which helped me cope up with the contraction pains. The doctor was present at hospital throughout my labour. The duty doctors/nurses used to continuously report my NST results, vitals etc to Vinutha mam & she used to vigilantly assess them and advise accordingly. She kept in constant touch with duty doctors over calls & whatsapp and visited me personally every now & then to assess my labour progress first hand. The doctor was patient & vigilant throughout my labour and took some timely decisions to help me & the baby when the FHR started dropping. Luckily, I delivered within 3-4 hours of getting good contractions. \nPost delivery, the doctor came to check on me at the odd hours around 10pm  and i was in awe of the kind of family support she must have had. She was at hospital from morning till late night that day. We are very lucky to have found an empathetic doctor like Vinutha mam. \nReasons why you should choose Dr.Vinutha mam :\n1. Vinutha mam is one of the sweetest gynaecologist I have ever met. She is super friendly, always smiling, welcomes you warmly, empathetic and genuinely cares for the patient. In the first visit itself, I'm sure you will get that positive vibe that she is the doctor you can blindly trust & go ahead with. She would give ample time to listen to you no matter what. Every visit is like that, not even once we felt we were not attended properly. She will be like a good friend to you, I bet on that! \n2. She is very passionate about her profession, possess great work ethics, very transparent and never advises unnecessary follow ups/tests/scans/medicines. \n3. She is very approachable & directly available on calls and whatsapp for all patient queries/concerns 24x7 and given her hectic schedule, you will be surprised at the super quick responses you get each time from her.\n4. The clinic visits are hassle free. The timings of your appointment are maintained well. All blood tests are done at the clinic itself by the doctor & medicines provided too. The blood test results are promptly updated to you over a call & you can collect them in your next clinic visit at your convenience! All scan/test reports are assessed through whatsapp and no follow ups asked if they are normal!\nHow much more easy can it get! :)\n5. She insists on natural/vaginal birth. \n6. Whenever there is a need for internal check up/pelvic exam, she gently talks to the patient, comforts them first, informs them about the procedure & it's need. This is an important quality a gynaecologist should possess in my opinion. \n\nLastly, Going through childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness. In this journey, the presence of a wonderful doctor is simply priceless. Thank you Dr. Vinutha mam for everything and may God bless you abundantly :",

                "review_text": "Hi I am glad that I found Dr Vinutha. My whole family is impressed by the way she works. From the confirmation of my pregnancy till post delivery, it's been a smooth journey with her. All my doubts and questions have been answered patiently and on time. She accepts the patients as they are and never complain back, always welcome will her great and simple smile. She gets emotionally attached and hence we feel like sharing our thoughts with our family member. She also explains and make us understand the health issues so well that we will be educated about the things very well. Vinutha Mam is a very friendly, patience, lovely and a safe Dr. to consult. \nI would like to tell about my experience on the day of the delivery. During my regular checkup and follow up Dr was very positive for normal delivery as I had no complications, my height was good and all factors were favoring normal delivery. On that day from morning I was not happy with the baby moments. As per Dr advice I called her after waiting for some time. She asked me to get the NST test done from a nearby hospital and send the report immediately. I got the test done and sent the report. Dr was not happy with the report and asked me to come down to cloudnine. In cloudnine the test was repeated, she was in constant touch with the duty doctors and even got the scan done. She visited the hospital and told us that she was not happy with the results of the NST test and did not want to take chance by sending me back home. She got me admitted and told that she would induce pains in the night and try for normal delivery. In the hospital the doctors monitored me and were updating the same to Dr Vinutha. At around 10.30 my NST report was fluctuating a lot and even pains had started. The baby heart beat was going down when I got my pains. The Duty Dr after consulting Dr Vinutha broke my water bag to checked if baby had passed motion, it was clear and baby had not passed motion. After breaking the water bag my pains increased, Dr Vinutha rushed to the hospital at around 12 at night she came and explained the situation to my family, my babies heart beat was dropping when I got my pains. She told that she could wait for normal delivery only if the heart beat was stable, and she was asking for our consent we gave Dr free hand to take decision. She informed us that she was not keen on waiting taking into account the situation and rushed me to the operation theater for C section. I was taken for C section and I delivered a baby boy at 12.45 night. My baby was almost blue when he was born and was rushed to NICU as he was facing breathing difficulty. Dr Vinutha finished my surgery waited for the pediatrician to check my child went and spoke to the pediatrician and confirmed that the baby is doing good before leaving the hospital at around 2.30 in the night. Later we came to know that I had a placenta abruption (a very rare scenario) and had blood clots on the uterus because of which my baby was not getting required blood and oxygen. I was very lucky enough that Dr Vinutha mam took a correct and timely decision to take me for C section. Because of Dr Vinutha I and my baby are safe and healthy today. Me and my family are indebted to Dr Vinutha Mam. Thanks a lot Mam for your kind gestures. I will infact miss meeting you every month henceforth . \n",

                "review_text": "Here is my amazing experience with a wonderful doctor. \n\nI convinced in the month of March and the COVID situation arised everywhere. Not knowing which doctor to consult due to travelling restrictions we started to look for a doctor close to our house. \n\nThat's when we came across Doctor Vinutha and her reviews were so good, hence we tried to give her a shot. Trust me I visited her once and I never looked back. \n\nNot only me but my entire family is in awe of her... Like you have already read that she shares her personal number through which she is in constant touch with you and clarifies all your normal to silly doubts, and guides you during emergencies. \n\nDuring my pregnancy she was very encouraging and sweet, she always encouraged me to do my work and keep myself busy and preoccupied. She never stopped me from anything, let it be eating or playing. The Only time she ever told me no was to stop me from drinking soda and eating fast foods. \n\nDoctor never asked me to visit her that frequently looking at the situation, she asked me to get my tests done and WhatsApp her the reports. She was always available to talk let it be during the night or early morning. \nShe would happily respond to all my doubts and quiries without getting irritated. \n\nThe pregnancy was smooth till 7th month, as I entered my 8th month, I started getting severe cramps and pain. I had entered into early labour and doctor admitted me immediately for observation. She not only personally stayed in touch with my parents but Also expained to us why she admitted me. She was very sure on not to get me into early delivery. She did everything possible to make sure I don't deliver and then when I was stable she sent be home and asked me to be on bed rest till I completed my 9 months. \n\nI had constant contactions but doctor was very positive and was very sure that she wanted me to have a normal delivery, hence she always gave me an option to induce my pain to deliver but also explained the consequences and encouraged me to have a normal delivery. \n\nWe waited and then I made it till week 39. But due to unavoidable circumstances my doctor had to go out of station and I completely understand because in this 9 months I have never heard her saying she is on leave or on break. I have always heard her say I had delivery, my patients are waiting etc. Once I visited twice in a gap of three days and those three days too she was just at hospital making sure her patients had safe delivery. \n\nHence, when she said unavoidable situation, I could completely understand and she ensured me that in her absence if I enter into labour she will make sure that I'll have the most safe and secure delivery. And what I feared came upon me, I entered into labour in my doctor's absence. The best part was even when she was traveling she replied to all my messages. when I got admitted due to my Labour pain, my doctor requested Dr. Varna Rao to take care of me and my delivery. Dr. Vinutha was in constant touch with Dr. Varna and dr. Varna was updating her about my progression. \nWhen I entered my active labour I still remember dr. Varna called my doctor to tell that I was ready to deliver and that she was going ahead with the delivery. \n\nI had the most safest delivery,  if am not wrong my active labour ended in less than two minutes and I am blessed with a beautiful baby girl. All thanks to my dear doctors. They did not induce labour pain, nor did they mess with the process, but they waited patiently..they made sure I had the most normal, natural and safest delivery. \n\nI specifically want to thank my doctor vinutha for encouraging me since day 1 and preparing me and my body for natural birth by encouraging me and strengthening me.. \n\nAnd yes a person can never do so much without the support from her family, the way her family supports and encourages her is just amazing, hats off to her and her blessed family... I am in awe of dr. Vinutha and her family. I am happy I met a person/ doctor like her in my life's journey who has become so close to my heart. \u2764\ufe0f \n\nThank you doctor for everything. \nShe is someone anyone can blindly trust on!!",

                "review_text": "My wife, after several years got pregnant through IVF, went to IVF hospital in the month of October and in November we got the sweet result. After that regular checkup, every thing was going well, 1st trimester then 2nd trimester we started countdown but at the start of 3rd trimester, Doctor then revealed that she had short cervix in the month of Jun with 29 weeks of pregnancy, doctor said that she will have preterm delivery. The word preterm shocked us, baby going to NICU, growing with the support of machines, thinking of it was very scary. We didn't know what to do, the doctor said to be on full bed rest and to try to pull upto 34weeks. That was very long way to go.\nThen after that began the search for this situation, went to near by hospitals but there were no NICU for that long of preterm. Then went to all known hospital there the doctor advised for cervical cerclage, there she said that as  it will be a preterm why not to take chances. We couldn't agree with her.\nNext day contacted a hospital which had Level III NICU, then we said the issue, after which the hospital staff gave us number of Dr Vinutha Prashanth. By then doctor herself called us and we told entire event. She then called us to the hospital. Next day we went to hospital where my wife was examined, after that Dr Vinutha explained every thing in detail as to what would happen and what and all treatment will be needed in case of preterm delivery. She then said my wife will have normal delivery. That was different as IVF pregnancies usually have to go through C section. Dr Vinutha explanation  was very simple to understand and we were convinced with her. Later doctor advised to get admitted as my wife needed complete bed rest not to get out of bed other than to the washroom.\nAfter that my wife was monitored daily through examination and NST. There was Dr Vinutha checking  twice daily. Dr Vinutha, she is excellent in her approach towards the case. ***** ********** *** *********** **** ** *********. Doctor then got as USG done to check the growth and condition of the baby. She said that the baby is good and not to worry. After 33 weeks Dr Vinutha was very positive that my wife may hold on upto 34-35 weeks, then there was no fear of baby going to NICU, as the baby was doing well in her mother's tummy. Then the day came at 34.3weeks, at around 6 in the evening water came out, my wife was shifted to labour room and at 9pm we had a baby boy delivered normally, no C section, Dr Vinutha was there delivering my baby, as promised she got him by normal delivery. Our baby was 2.2kg, Neonatologists were there who checked on and said that the baby is healthy and doing good. Our baby was in NICU for a day only for check up. Next day he was there with her mother. \nAll thanks to our Dr Vinutha Prashanth, her professionalism, determination, kindness and excellent approach towards the case, made our life. Just one thing to say \"she is one gem of a doctor\". Finally we would like to say that one can blindly go to Dr Vinutha Prashanth, one will like her in first visit. Just trust, rest leave it to Dr Vinutha Prashanth. We are really greatful to her. ",

She was good in advising, but not to the level of care or information\u2019s to be passed for the 1st pregnancy lady. We were not so satisfied with the overall interactions & consultations.\nBut for my wife\u2019s 2nd pregnancy we had contacted Dr Vinutha Prashanth as we had come to know about her professionalism, utmost care for her patient\u2019s, guiding, consulting with clearing every doubts with patience etc through my cousins wife who got consultations from her.\n\nWhen we met her for the first time itself we were very impressed & surprised to see the Dr in Bangalore (even in her busy schedules) with so much of patience to list to patients & guiding with all instructions giving confidence of all assurance from her side. \nFor example- She gave her number on our 1st visit itself & asked to call her anytime if incase of any problem or inconveniences caused which we hardly see in many a doctor\u2019s.\nHer way of talking, concerns & confidence giving consultations gave a full strength to my wife. In her 2nd pregnancy I never saw my wife worried or tensed or uncomfortable (having certain doubts in mind). Which I had seen lots of those kinds in her 1st pregnancy. \nWe both don\u2019t any words to express about car taking of her patients. It\u2019s just awesome & unimaginable. I feel we just don\u2019t have any words to express & just say thanks to her.\nOne main thing I have to say that we are basically from north Karnataka & had decision of going to our home town for the delivery. But because of Dr Vinutha Prashanth\u2019s care & her professionalism we canceled our plan & decided to have the delivery from her itself.\nFor your updates it was not mine or my wife\u2019s decision but it was whole of our family\u2019s decision to have the delivery from her side. So you can understand what her impression is & believe our whole family is having. \nOn the delivery day we called Dr Vinutha Prashanth before leaving the house & reached Ovum hospital at 5.15 AM. Even at that odd hour she visited immediately & gave confidence & assurance to my wife. And till my wife leaves for labor room she was either present in the hospital or was taking continuous updates from the duty doctor. Infact she use to give me also the confidence that not worry & everything will be alright. She was continuously monitoring on how my wife was progressing, baby's health (heartbeat) and kept the OT ready in case of any emergencies. She has been calm and patient with us throughout this pregnancy.\nBy God's grace everything went well. Both the mother and the baby are healthy and doing well.\nThank you so much from bottom of my heart for your all the help Dr Vinuth.\n\n",

I literally disturbed her many times due to the problem we had. She was always there to guide and help us.First time I saw a  doctor who forced patients to go for normal delivery. No investigations unless it is needed very minimal medications. This is where we call a doctor with heart and soul towards their profession. Especially she is more of patients comfortable oriented.I would really thank Dr. Vinutha from bottom of my heart. If you are one who is looking for the pregnancy check up or any gynec problem with out any second thoughts please visit.",

Her wealth of knowledge and experience in obstetrics reassured me that I was in capable hands.She  provided guidance throughout my pregnancy journey. She answered my questions patiently, addressed my concerns, and ensured that I was well informed about each stage of pregnancy. What made her truly exceptional was the personalized care she provided.

Driven by a genuine concern for both mother and child, she consistently emphasized the importance of staying healthy and taking necessary precautions. When a cervical stitch was deemed necessary based on a scan, she prioritized my comfort, seeking multiple opinions before proceeding and prescribing the right medications to alleviate potential pain and discomfort. \n\nDr. Vinutha's accessibility through calls and WhatsApp played a crucial role in maintaining my peace of mind throughout the pregnancy. Beyond her medical expertise, she proved to be a wonderful person, fully dedicated to her role. My journey to full term was eased by her guidance, and I am grateful for her exceptional care.

Vinutha ma'am immediately suggested for a C section which was urgent to not to take any risk and we planned Surgery the very next day, and all i saw the next day was a cute little girl baby healthy with no major issues.Thanks to Vinutha ma'am for giving us such a care, and the doctor that we think to go to again with no second thought.\ud83d\ude42",

What we liked most from Ma\u2019am are 1) Absolute clarity on issues and explaining us in legible way and 2) Prescribing only what is required. \n\nBased on my scan results in 37th Week, Dr. explained us the Pros and Cons for the type of delivery. After that, in my 38th Week, through Cesarean, blessed with Baby Boy. \n\nWe thank from bottom of our heart for successfully helping us in this journey and strongly recommend her. \n",

Dr. Vinutha consistently impressed me with her availability and promptness in providing guidance and medications whenever I needed them.During the crucial moment of delivery, when complications arose and I had to undergo an emergency cesarean operation due to the baby passing meconium, Dr. Vinutha's swift response was truly remarkable. Despite the urgency of the situation, she was by my side within minutes, ensuring that the surgery was performed without delay. Her quick action prevented the need for our baby to be admitted to the NICU for which we are immensely grateful.Overall, my experience with Dr. Vinutha was exceptional. Her expertise, compassion, and dedication to her patients make her stand out as a top-notch gynecologist. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking quality care during their pregnancy journey.",

She was always available on WhatsApp/Phone Call in case of any concerns.She  answered all my queries in very calm way.She also explained the entire labour process in detail and always encouraged me to prepare physically as well as mentally for Normal delivery. She never asked me to go for any unnecessary scan or medications when not required.She prefers to share the scan report on WhatsApp which saves the consultation fees as well as time.Our pregnancy journey went very smooth with her guidance and support and we were blessed with baby boy via normal delivery. Post delivery also she asked me to visit her after one week,to check if the episiotomy is healing properly. The entire birth experience was so smooth because of her only.I really appreciate her care and support over the nine months which made the entire experience wonderful.",

Naturally I was quite anxious and had many queries for every consultation I had with her. Dr Vinutha not only answered my queries but also made me feel comfortable to ask in those queries and made me feel valid. I was reassured at every consultation. The best thing with her consultation was that I was provided with complete information at every stage of my pregnancy and was made aware of my choices and it's impact. Along with this , she was available on WhatsApp for any quick queries and report consultation which saved us from multiple consultation visits. Due to my gestation diabetes, I was recommended with an induction at my 39  week. Although the initial plan was to have gel, with my dilation and labour progress, I was allowed to dilate naturally until my active labour phase post which I was induced via IV for progress. I was calmly and compassionately guided during my delivery. I owe my pleasant experience both the pregnancy as well as my delivery to her. I would definitely recommend her if you are looking for happier and healthy pregnancy  delivery",

During our first visit itself we felt that we made right choice by opting her.\nAs it was my first pregnancy was bit scared but doctor made us so comfortable and enquired in detail about the history of pregnancy and was very patient in understanding everything we narrated.\nShe always prescribed basic tablets (calcium and iron) even though we asked her \"is that all? :-)\nAfter completion of 37th week we were bit concerned but doctor always said with smile on her face \"wait till due date whats the hurry\". At end of 39th week which was nearing due date, since there was no pain , doctor asked to admit so that pain can be induced.\nDoctor explained each and every process of pain induction, what are possible outcome, what are following process for each outcome.\nAfter couple of induction there was no improvement. \nAt this stage even we thought it would be C section. But doctor again gave us couple of options and she was the one who was trying all possible way to get normal delivery done.\nAnd after third pain induction, everything fell in place and by Gods grace we are blessed with little angel.\nNot sure how many doctor would have done that but we will be always thankful to Dr Vinutha for pushing us and guiding us in right path.\nI would definetly recommed Dr Vinutha and you will be always greeted with lovely smile on her face which will make you feel that you are in safe hands.\n\nThank you again doctor.",

We were able to trust her from the very first meeting and followed her advice to the words. Throughout the entire pregnancy journey, she provided exceptional care, addressing every concern with patience and clarity. Around the due date my wife\u2019s platelet count were dipping a bit and we were nervous but her reassuring advices , careful monitoring of health and confidence kept us calm. During delivery, her reassuring presence made all the difference, ensuring a safe and memorable experience. We delivered a healthy baby boy and my wife recovered very well post delivery. We are forever grateful for her professionalism, compassion, and dedication to our family's well-being. Dr. Vinutha truly goes above and beyond, and we wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking top-notch obstetric care. In our experience, someone who understands her patients, counsels well and ensures right medical care makes the entire pregnancy journey wonderful and we were fortunate to found one in Dr. Vinutha.

I found her online once i tested positive and i chose her due to her excellent previous reviews. My first conversation with her itself impressed me since she asked me to wait and come after 2 weeks for consultation for better confirmation of test results. This assured me that she does not simply call the patients to make more bills. Dr. Vinutha is amazing at her work,highly professional, kind , dedicated and well spoken. She values our time and money. She developed a great bond with me over time. She is available for help over whatsapp /call at any point of time. Whenever i used to go to her with any concern/ problem she used to assure me in such a positive and soothing way that all mine/my husbands worries used to vanish. :) She encourages for Normal delivery but also understands if we want it otherwise due to any other reason. She explains any condition in a clear and crisp manner with facts and does not unnecessarily scare you which is very good. Also she does not call you over to just see the test/scan results and asks to send over whatsapp. Her clinic is well maintained. Overall i have only positives about her. She is filled with positivity and cheerfulness . I am fully satisfied and extremely happy that we chose Dr. Vinutha for our pregnancy journey. While writing the review i am reminded of all the times i went to her clinic, I will miss visiting her. I surely recommend her to everyone planning to start a new family. Thank you Dr. Vinutha. May God bless you and your family :) :) ",

Throughout our experience at the hospital, we received exceptional treatment from Dr. Vinutha. She was the second doctor we consulted during my pregnancy as we shifted our residence, and we noticed a significant difference between the two experiences. Dr. Vinutha is truly an amazing doctor who treats her patients with the utmost care and makes them feel comfortable discussing their problems. She avoids recommending unnecessary medicines or scans and is always professional and understanding.\n\nDr. Vinutha's approach to patient care was a breath of fresh air. She didn't just treat us as patients, but as human beings. She listened to our concerns, addressed our questions and provided us with clear explanations of what was happening with my pregnancy. She shared her knowledge and expertise with us, without ever making us feel like we were being talked down to. Her compassionate approach to medicine made us feel at ease, and we felt confident that we were in good hands.\n\nOne of the things that stood out to us was Dr. Vinutha's willingness to go above and beyond. She shared her phone number with us and replied promptly to our queries via WhatsApp and phone calls, unlike the previous doctor we consulted. She even checked up on us after hours to make sure everything was going smoothly. This level of care and attention to detail made us feel valued as patients.\n\nDr. Vinutha's guidance and motivation during the pregnancy were invaluable. She constantly guided us on how to prepare for a normal delivery and encouraged us to stay positive and confident throughout the process.\n\nWe can confidently say that opting for Dr. Vinutha's care at the last minute was one of the best decisions we made during the pregnancy. We highly recommend her to anyone in need of exceptional medical care and support during pregnancy and childbirth.",

Starting from the confirmation of pregnancy till the delivery my wife had many ups and downs and we got proper guidance and support from Dr. Vinutha throughout. Even post-delivery she kept in touch with us and celebrated like a family member. \n\n\nAt every visit. Dr. Vinutha explains what is happening and explains the changes to mother and baby. She does not recommend unnecessary medications, scans and tests. She recommends proper diet and exercise to follow during pregnancy. She communicates clearly at every step and helps us resolve all our doubts.\n\nShe is very experienced and has clear understanding of what needs to be done in case of emergency. She handles risks effectively. During the pregnancy my wife had some complications in second trimester. Dr. Vinutha identified that, explained clearly what the issue is and explained the consequences and what needs to be done further. She got my wife admitted to hospital immediately, performed the required emergency procedure and prevented further issues. After that she clearly explained the steps, pros and cons and the steps we needed to follow further for the rest of the pregnancy. She had us prepared mentally for the rest of our journey. She explained what will constitute emergency for us and asked us to call immediately if we see those signs.\n\n\nIn last trimester, my wife had signs of labor during early morning, and I could call her immediately. She informed the Cloud nine, Kanakpura hospital in advance and had them prepared in advance. She came to the hospital early and my wife had a normal delivery of baby girl. Since it was early pre-term the baby was kept in NICU for some days. She kept in touch with us regularly monitored the progress of our baby with pediatrician parallelly and continued advising us on the same. She suggested us on all the possibilities of handling the hospital bill for both baby and mother.\n\nThanks to Dr. Vinutha both me and my wife were able to handle the tough situations during pregnancy and keep ourselves positively throughout our journey.",

Dr. Vinutha stands out as one of the most thorough and compassionate gynecologists I've ever encountered.\n\nDr. Vinutha possesses an exceptional ability to explain intricate medical procedures in a way that is both comprehensive and accessible. She meticulously follows all necessary protocols, leaving no room for ambiguity or risk-taking. Her dedication to patient education is evident as she patiently discusses each detail of the procedure, ensuring that I was well-informed and comfortable with every aspect.\n\nWhat sets Dr. Vinutha apart is her approach to presenting options. Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution, she takes the time to understand individual circumstances and provides a range of choices. It's empowering to be given the autonomy to choose the most suitable process, and Dr. Vinutha respects and supports these decisions.\n\nIn my experience, Dr. Vinutha is not just a doctor, she is a compassionate and highly skilled professional who genuinely cares for her patients. I wholeheartedly recommend her as one of the best doctors to consult, as her expertise, thoroughness, and patient-centric approach set her apart in the field of gynaecology.",

We consulted Dr. Vinutha for pregnancy and delivery. During our first meet we got a very good impression and decided to proceed with our journey with her. She always welcomed us with a humble smile on her face, making us comfortable during every checkup. Our whole family was impressed with the way she explains everything calmly without disregarding even the silliest of queries. Most importantly she never suggests unnecessary scans or medicines. Every scan/blood work to be done is explained by the doctor nicely and every small doubt is cleared. I've never seen any doctor give their personal/WhatsApp number.!!!  She is just a call/msg away during emergencies. She informs us about complications IF ANY and gives valuable suggestions and takes timely decisions. For instance, I started getting preterm labor contractions at 34 weeks which she diagnosed at the right time and gave me steroid shots to be safe/ prepared in terms of delivery and baby's well-being just in case my labor started. She has a good decision making ability, extremely patient and dedicated towards her patients and work. I delivered my baby boy in Cloudnine Hospital, Kanakapura road, Bengaluru through LSCS done by Vinutha ma\u2019am and her team. She gets emotionally attached to her patients and their family as though it's her own family. The best part is she visited regularly before and even after delivery no matter how late it got like 9:30/10 pm after finishing consultations at her clinic. In fact she even visited when my baby got readmitted due to jaundice relapse. ***** *** ** *** **** ************* **** **** **** ******* Thank you so much from me and my family Vinutha ma\u2019am for everything, you are a wonderful doctor one can have during their pregnancy and delivery. From the confirmation of my pregnancy till delivery and post delivery, it's been a smooth journey with you. !! I strongly recommend her for anyone who wants a positive pregnancy and delivery. I will miss meeting and interacting with you. You are really a blessing to all expecting parents. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nRegards,\nMrs. Meghana Kantesh ",

We feel very lucky to have been consulting Vinutha ma\u2019am at Cloudnine Kanakapura Road from the very first month of pregnancy till delivery and post sessions. \n\nWhen the pregnancy test at home was positive, we were not even sure of wanting the baby.  We met Dr Vinutha at the hospital then for the first time and she was extremely calm and reassuring on how this is a part of life and everything goes along together. \n\nDuring all our follow up sessions, she has been informing and guiding us on what to expect ahead along with the essential pregnancy care. She also provided exercises to assist with a normal delivery well in advance and was available on phone for any queries or emergency. \n\nDr Vinutha did ensure to keep us posted on the status of the baby and advised on important things to note. She has been extremely informative during her explanations and reviews which helped us remain assured about the next course of action. \n\nForemost, she ensured to keep my wife confident and determined that a normal delivery is perfectly possible and that there was absolutely nothing to worry about. Her confidence was quite reassuring and motivating towards ensuring a happy delivery experience. \n\nThank you, ma\u2019am, for all your assistance and availability throughout. The experience of being in the delivery room with such a fine doctor was heartening and blissful, the best moment of my life!",

She is very friendly, listens attentively and comfortable to approach. She asks only for necessary tests, scans and explains why they are needed. She is available on whatsapp for queries.\n\nUnexpectedly in 33rd week i had aminuotic fluid leak and was admitted. I gave sleepless nights to Dr. She was very supportive and clearly explained family members about the next proceedings. Dr. was strongly trying to push delivery by a week so that baby develops well in womb. Medicines were provided for lung development, to avoid infection , scans and NST were done regularly. This was my first pregnancy after 6 years of marriage and she knew how precious this baby was for us. She was genuinely caring and focused towards safe delivery of baby.\nOn 5th day after admission early in the morning baby heart rate increased and Dr. immediately took the call for c section. I was quickly shifted to labor ward , everything went well and was blessed with baby boy.\nFurthermore, i faced severe gastritis issue before and after delivery. Scans , ECGs were done and Dr. assessed the situation and provided medication accordingly. From admission till discharge Dr. visited us frequently, monitored  constantly and guided  the duty staff.  She was always available when needed and gave me confidence throughout my delivery.\nI am glad we chose Dr. Vinutha. I strongly recommend her to my friends and relatives. \nThanks Dr. for all you have done for us. Wish you and your family good health and happiness.\nLots of love \u2764\ufe0f Ramya & Anand",

She is a friendly person and welcomes with a warmth and smile always.\nShe never hesitates to answer even the silly queries that we put forth. The clinic is maintained well, credits to her\nassistant in charge who takes care of all these stuff. Till my 9 months of checkup whenever we meet its always been \na conversation with loads of smile and no hard feelings.\nDuring the phase of pregnancy i had the normal checkups and scans done smoothly, and never had any complications.\nshe will suggest only the tests or scans that is needed based on the individuals health concern. She's very reachable, she replies to your questions over WhatsApp and also responds to calls in emergency situations.\nIdeally, the whole journey of pregnancy and checkup was completely a cakewalk for me.\n\nThis was my 2nd pregnancy after a gap of 7 years, and i personally had so much confusions of choosing normal or \nc-section since my first baby is also c-section. but doctor took time to make us understand on the risks involved \nin opting normal after c-section even though there is a long gap, she gave clear idea on scar ruptures that happen for \nthe mother when second is a normal delivery. Thinking of my health and baby to struggle more to get normally delivered,\nwe mentally got fine with opting a planned C-section. During the delivery time, all process went smoothly and i never\nfelt any anguish or complexity. By God's grace and Doctor's effort , delivered girl baby on 30th July 2022.\nThe baby was healthy and weighed 3.6. Baby health was constant and good sign to discharge in two days of delivery.\nI strongly recommend to go with Dr.Vinutha for a smooth pregnancy journey and delivery phase. \nShe always enquire about the my health and baby\u2019s health even after the delivery.  I don\u2019t think any of the other doctors will do a follow up after the delivery. Thanks to Dr.Vinutha mam and team of Cloudnine for making the delivery a smooth phase and return home healthily.\n",

I first visited her for my delayed periods with PCOS and she motivated me to take up  good lifestyle habits and diet plan which corrected my cycles with very less medication and since then she has been with me throughout my pregnancy journey as well. \n\nI have been seeing her since day 1 of my pregnancy, she explains all the necessary things in detail and she always motivated me to take up my pregnancy very well. She only suggest necessary scans and medications throughout, also very well explains the need of every scan, blood tests and medications. I had been very active throughout my pregnancy and all thanks to her. She was always a phone call away for any of my queries at any time of the day. \n\nAlthough I had completed 40 weeks of my pregnancy, I did not have any symptoms of labour then she clearly explained me about inducing labour since I always wanted NVD and Dr.Vinutha as well motivated me to go for NVD. \n\nAt the end of 40th week I opted for labour induction and the procedure started and it went for a day and half long and my body did not support the medication and it was a failed induction, also baby\u2019s head was not yet fixed which made it more difficult. Throughout the process she made sure that she had a constant check on my condition and she always took care of me. \n\nAfter all this, she clearly explained me the process of waiting for labour pain and consequences and then we decided to go for C-section late in the night and immediately informed her. She did not hesitate to visit us late in the night and to take up the operation at that time. I was so relaxed to see her at that time since I knew that me and my baby were in safe hands. \n\nWent into OT at 9:50 PM and we had our beautiful girl with us by 10:10 PM. I\u2019m always grateful to Dr. Vinutha Prashant for her humbleness, commitment, care and concern she has towards her patients. \n\nShe has also helped my cousins and friends with their gynaecology problems as well and they are happy with the results. \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr.Vinutha to all the women around. \n\nThank you so much \nVishala",

Also, clinic is maintained very well.\n\nWe visited Divine Women's Healthcare clinic after seeing reviews which are posted in Google. Trust us it was not a surprise in the other way, doctor is very much approachable, polite and humble. We have never seen such a polite and friendly doctor in our entire life. Doctor responds to our call and messages if we need any information or in the matter of emergency. \n\nWe met Doctor Vinutha when my wife was one month pregnant. Doctor had clearly explained all the  plan of actions that we need to take care in this nine months journey in every stages.\n\nDoctor usually don't recommend too many scannings or medical tests unless there are any irregularities. However, she recommends scannings for mother at each trimester to determine the growth/health of baby. \n\nUsually other doctors recommends their own set of hospital for delivery based on their convenience. But Vinutha doctor will respect our decision to choose hospital for delivery based on the proximity from our locality. \n\nAs the date was approaching towards delivery doctor was so friendly with my wife as the level of trauma reduceds to some extent. \n\nDuring final trimester my wife suffered from Polyhydramnios. Doctor had politely made us understand what are the concequences that we may come across in the future and we were also mentally prepared for that. \n\nDue to above extremely condition my wife had to go for cesarean delivery as we don't want to risk mother's or baby's life. Upon our decision doctor agreed to take case. \n\nOn the date of case doctor was very much approachable and she always respected our decision.\n\nOn 20th July 2022 my wife and I have been blessed with cute girl baby\u2764\ufe0f We are extremely happy\ud83d\ude0a\n\nPost pregnancy doctor had taken utmost care of my wife until she is discharged from the hospital. \n\nI have never seen such a dedicated doctor in my entire life for making betterment in patients life \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFinally, Megha, my daughter Charishya and i want to thank doctor for taking utmost care and making this journey a memorable one\u2764\ufe0f",

Right from day one she has worked with me on lowering my anxiety and instilling me with positive thoughts. These close to 9 months weren't easy for me but Dr. Vinutha made sure that we monitor my health and baby's growth regularly. To complicate matters further, I developed gestational diabetes and chloestasis both of which were caught early because of her careful listening and observation. I was rest assured that I am in safe hands. I had Dr. Vinutha's constant 24X7 support on phone and when I told her about my Cholestasis symptoms, without any further delay she took a call to put me on steroids which helped my baby strengthen her lungs and mature the other organs too. At around 36 weeks my precious lil daughter came into this world. For this precious lil gift I will forever be indebted to Dr. Vinutha.  She's like a champion warrior and I am so glad I found her on my side during this uphill battle.\n\nFew more pointers which set Dr. Vinutha apart from everyone else are: \n\nShe is passionate about helping the mom to be and can think from their perspective. **** *********** ***** *** ***** **** ***** ** ** ****** ** ****** ******** \n\nShe has always been very  receptive to what I had to say and clarified our doubts at each and every step. \n\nCan't put this in any other better way, but money is the last thing  on her mind. Mother's and baby's care is of topmost priority. She is basically a friend and a guide who will make this important journey stress free and smooth for you. \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Vinutha to each and everyone who wants to\nenjoy this special phase of their life. \n\nOne last tip for all moms to be, pls do watch Dr. Vinutha's video on Facebook so that you also can be prepared for step by step development of your baby during your pregnancy.",

Apart from having a healthy and regularly monitored pregnancy in her guidance, I also had a normal delivery at the end \ud83d\ude0a at a good hospital suggested by her which is quite near to my residence.\n\nShe was always reachable through WhatsApp and calls for any emergency or any queries. She responded and calmly guided well with next steps even in the midnight when I went into labour.\n\nShe has been really supporting right from the beginning.. I felt comfortable with her in the first meeting itself because of her down to earth attitude and understanding nature. she encouraged and cleared many doubts and fears and I'll be thankful to her always for that. She explains things clearly and maintains transparency till the end. She listens with patience and suggests the best always. She never prescribed *********** ********* ** so called sugary health drinks and insisted on having a natural healthy diet.There have been instances when I could not reach clinic in time for regular check ups but she never complained. She is very considerate and helpful.\n\nI faced a tough time with an ankle fracture in my 5th month and its so sweet of her that she felt very disheartened that I can't do exercises that can help for normal delivery, that shows how dedicated she is towards encouraging a healthy normal delivery if the expectant mother also chooses the same .. nevertheless she waited for the right time and suggested all the exercises as soon as i healed and stressed on doing those exercises everyday, and i simply followed her and had complete trust in her and her expertise. She tries her best for a normal delivery even till the end and she supports and fills confidence through out in a friendly manner which makes the patient feel stress free.. Kudos to her for that \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDoctor Vinutha Prashanth ** ********** *** ** *** **** *** ********* ************** *** a very good human being too.** *** ** *** ** * *** ****** I am very thankful to her and will never forget my pregnancy and delivery experience with her and I wish she gets all that she wishes for in life.. \ud83d\ude0a",

I went back to Dr. Vinutha as my physician suggested a pelvic scan. Dr. Vinutha found that I had an ectopic pregnancy and it needed urgent care and monitoring. As my beta HCG levels were lower than 1000, she suggested to continuously monitor the beta HCG levels every 48 hours and personally monitored me and gave her personal number to reach out in case of even slightest discomfort. She had explained us in detail about ectopic pregnancy and the risks of rupture within the tube and complications. While i was doing ok for a week, I had another episode of severe pain and blackout. She immediately asked me to admit in emergency and started monitoring my vitals every 30 minutes and kept assessing if I need a surgery as there was internal bleeding. She monitored me whole night for every 30 minutes and that gave me a lot of reassurance as I went with lot of pain and was very scared. She monitored my bp, pulse, hemoglobin levels and conducted scans to see if the internal bleeding was increasing. All this was done throughout the night and she was in constant touch with me and the nurses who were attending me. However, as my vitals were stable and my blood count didn't fall further, she assured that I will be alright and don't need a surgery as that would lead to further recovery period and it was not needed in my case. She gave us the option to decide and strongly recommended that we don't get the surgery. Although we were very scared, we trusted her and we are happy we did so. After 2 days of monitoring, she discharged me and explained how I should still expect some pain and also monitor my beta HCG every 48 hours. Now after 3 weeks, my beta HCG has gone down below 30 and my pain has reduced. I am feeling completely alright and all this without a surgery. I am thankful to Dr. Vinutha for her right advice, her utmost care, friendliness and her reassurance when we needed the most. ",

I feel she is one the best and rightest decisions we made during my pregnancy. \n\nDr. Vinutha is a very friendly doctor whom we can comfortably ask any number of queries. She patiently listens to all of them and clarifies the same. She is also available for WhatsApp chat and responds to our concerns there too without fail. She always asked to share all scan or test reports there and avoid separate consultation for this alone, which I feel we rarely hear these days.\n\nDuring this journey she always insisted and guided on following right diet, and never encouraged over medication or unnecessary scans or tests. She guided on the pregnancy exercise and it\u2019s importance when one goes for normal vaginal delivery.\n\nDuring labour, when I called her and informed she ensured that we don\u2019t panic and asked us to visit hospital. She was already there when we reached and I did feel the warmth just like from a very dear family member through her presence and comforting words. She was present throughout my labour and delivered our precious little boy around 11:30 PM. The doctor did wait for an hour more in the hospital and ensured that I was fine before she left late in the night. \n\nVery very thankful to you ma\u2019am for all that you have done. I was a bit worried earlier about having to stay back in Bangalore for my delivery but you are the person who did make me feel very comfortable and like I\u2019m on safe hands. Thanks a ton ma\u2019am for everything. Very happy and satisfied that we consulted you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0a \n\nI have always seen you very pleasant and active even though you have had a busy schedule the previous night. This shows your passion towards your profession ma\u2019am. Wholeheartedly wish you all the very best for both your professional and personal life. May you be blessed with all that your deserve and desire. May you reach more and more heights. \n\nThanks again and best regards \nSudheer and Ashitha\n",

Due to a bad and sad experience of my first delivery elsewhere, searched a lot and finally got to know about Vinutha Doctor. The first meet with her made us feel like this is the doctor to go for. Been 9 months and I delivered a baby boy with all effort, concern and care of the doctor. We are a happy couple with two kids, but just to go to her again, we feel like having an other kid. \n\nThe doctor is very professional, powerful at the hospital, while also being friendly, humble, simplicity and caring which is kind of contradicting to each other. She does not give you unnecessary tablets, different growth powders (previous experience), no unnecessary scans, no dramas, and very affordable and very very approachable. We have even called her at night sometimes and she provided necessary suggestions. Just her words \"Nothing to worry\" was my huge strength.\n\nFinally we got admitted to cloudnine hospital for delivery and the doctor helped deliver our baby through c section (first baby was also c section). The second day I had breathing issues (since I am not comfortable to ac and windows were closed) and immediately made sure necessary medication is given. The third day I was up and running. It's rare to say this about the doctor, but I miss seeing her regularly after the delivery. After the delivery I wanted to see her face first as there is someone there to care for me . \n\nToday is the forth day after the operation and I am walking and talking normally and writing this review. In my previous operation, I took 20 days to recover like this.\n\nThank you Doctor Vinutha, you are Divine as your clinic name says and one can trust you blindly. God bless you always and we thank you for every support you gave us :)",

During the first visit itself, I came to know that doctor is very polite and friendly person. This helped me to have a comfortable interaction with the doctor throughout this pregnancy journey. Whenever I visit the doctor, she always gives enough time to address whatever the queries I had. First she always listens to me with utmost patience and then answer all my queries very clearly and concisely without creating any confusion.\n\nWhen I came to know about my gestational diabetes, doctor explained me everything related to that without scaring us. She also suggested to follow a proper diet (directed us to a very good dietician) and make me believe that it can be controlled easily by following a diet without going for the medicine. She asked me to monitor the sugar levels (if possible) on a weekly basis (at first) and twice/ thrice in a week during the later stages of my pregnancy. I used to send my sugar levels to the doctor by watsapp and she used to guide me through watsapp only. This helped to keep my sugar levels very much under control till my last day of the pregnancy without taking any medicine. She was just a phone call away for any queries I had.\n\nShe always used to tell me to do yoga, walking and pregnancy exercises to have a normal delivery. Even if I tell her saying it will be difficult for me to do the exercises during my 8th and 9th month, she used to motivate me by providing the mental strength to do the exercises. Of course, it helped me a lot during my pregnancy journey. \n\nFinally, I am blessed with a beautiful baby GIRL in my 40th week of the pregnancy (it was a normal delivery). A big thanks to Dr. Vinutha for providing all the help, guidance, care and assistance during this wonderful journey of my pregnancy. \n\nI know this is a lengthy post, but can't help as I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for Vinutha ma'am (that's how I used to call her) for being there in this beautiful journey. THANK YOU VINUTHA MA'AM for making this journey beautiful.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Vinutha Prashanth for the pregnant women.",

And we used to collect reports only during next visit. This helped us in avoiding unnecessary movement to labs, especially during covid 2nd peak time. (Also it saved my time, myself being a working professional)\n\nDuring each of the visit, she always listened to my silliest doubts / questions patiently and never got angry or irritated. She always explained why each of the test she is prescribing is needed and what is happening in the process of my pregnancy. She was always very frank and honest and didn't give any false hopes. She was always available to calls or whatsapp for any issues; its rare to see such a surgeon so easily available to her patients! \n\nMine was a planned c-section due to some complications. Though i was mentally prepared for the operation, when i saw OT, i started to panic. Glad that she spoke to me and made me comfortable. Also during my stay in the hospital, she ensured to visit me once a day and motivated me to get back to normalcy ASAP. She didn't let me simply lie on bed (which my family wanted me to) and asked me to start walking, be active. This has really helped me to bounce back, i feel; it has not made me feel like a patient but a mother! \n\nWould highly recommend this doctor.",

We found the adress of her clinic (Divine Women & Child Speciality Clinic) and visited her and we were impressed with the way she listened to everything with patience and explained in detail on how our pregnancy journey will be for the months to come, so we decided that she is right doctor for our requirements. She is very patient and explains everything in details. She is very prompt to answer the call and respond to whatsaap messages immediately if we have any concerns or queries. We had a very possitive journey of 9 months in her guidance. She never gave us any unnecessary medication and she always encouraged us to gain the required proteins and vitamins naturally through the food we consume. In our case, unfortunately the water broke and we had to go for C-Section. The water broke in the morning and we immediately called the doctor and she advised us to visit the hospital, by the time we reach the hospital, she had informed the nursing staff over there to complete the primary checks and update her. She rushed to the hospital as soon as possible and examined me and our baby thoroughly and advised us to get admitted immediately. Through the regular scans we had noticed nuchal cord or Cord-Around-the Neck of the baby was present and since the water had broken our baby was facing few difficulties (heart beat used to drop occasionally and then it used to get back to normal) so we did not have much time to wait for the natural labour pain to occur. She gave us lot of courage and she was monitoring the situation closely and was very patient to wait for almost 10 hours after my water had broken. Since things did not work the way we wanted we had to take the decision to go for C-Section. One thing that makes Dr. Vinutha stand out from the rest is the combination of patience, knowledge and the caring nature that she has towards people who consult her. We highly recommend Dr. Vinutha Prashanth.Thank you so much for making our pregancy journey so beautiful and we really appreciate all your support and guidance provided during our pregenency journey.",

She doesn't recommend any unnecessary procedure or tests and always gives a valid reason behind any test she would ask to get done. A major concern during final few weeks was, my wife tested COVID positive. We were very worried about the baby to be, but Dr. Vinutha guided us during those tough times and assured that she would deliver the baby even if she would have to wear a PPE kit during the delivery. Thankfully days before the delivery my wife\u2019s COVID test came back negative and on 10th May 2021 we welcomed our baby girl through csection delivery (personal decision by us). Dr. Vinutha till the end was confident that she would try and help my wife deliver our baby through normal delivery but we were very clear about the cesarean option. I am grateful that doctor respected my wife\u2019s choice and made her feel safe about the surgery. She cleared all the doubts we had about the operation. Our baby is 9 days old and healthy. We would like to thank doctor from the bottom of our heart for her guidance and support. We highly recommend her to all the expecting couples, especially first time parents, who are hunting for an ObGyn.",

Thank you doctor, we 3 are grateful that we chose you as our doctor through this amazing journey.\n\nWhen I got to know I\u2019m pregnant, we first consulted at a leading hospital near our house. They did the scan immediately, blood tests and confirmed its pregnancy. However from there my night mare started with loads of hormone tablets and injections. I did asked with that doctor why should i be on this hormone tablets, we were not given any acceptable answer.  They also made me to do scans every 3 days in a span of 1.5 weeks. At last i was fed up and was searching for a good Gynaecologist nearby and  i found out Dr. Vinutha Prashanth through google.\n\nI visited Dr. Vinutha first in August and with the first visit itself i was very comfortable and she did spend quality time to listen to me. She infact asked me why am i having these hormone tablets?. She asked me to stop all those hormone tablets and then put me on minimal vital tablets for pregnancy. That itself was a relief for me. From there our journey began with Dr. Vinutha and trust me that was the best decision me and my hubby made. She was available every time  when ever i had questions and supported me emotionally through this entire phase. Her patience to listen to her patients is commendable. My delivery experience was so smooth and she explained us each aspects on time. Moreover she supported me emotionally and also allowed my hubby to be with me during my delivery time. That was a major relief i had and i am always thankful to you Doctor.\n\nFinally a big thanks from me, husband and Izahaak. Doctor, Definitely once he grows up, I am going to tell him this piece of story from my life in which your foot print is firmly affixed.\n\nAll the best for you and wish you all the success. Doctors like you are equal to God.\n\nThanks,\nOur Small Happy Family",

Me and my husband have done a lot of research and  checked all the gynaecologists on Practo and google reviews. Finally we have narrowed down on 2 doctors out of which Dr Vinutha Prashanth is the second one on the list. After consulting the first doctor we weren\u2019t satisfied and consulted Dr Vinutha, in the first meet itself we felt that we can completely trust her with our pregnancy. I\u2019m someone who always over thinks and gets into a panic mode easily but Dr Vinutha always with her calm manner used to talk to me and clear all my inhibitions. She\u2019s someone who keeps in touch with the patients even on phone So that we can get any medical advice immediately. She always made us feel comfortable and cleared all our doubts and also pushed me to do prenatal yoga and regular exercise. She has never prescribed me unnecessary medicines or scans. She has mentally prepared me for the labour so that I don\u2019t panic in the last moment which most of the doctors don\u2019t do. Finally she has waited for almost 10hrs of my labour and has been with me through out constantly pushing me and giving me confidence that I can do it. Without her I couldn\u2019t even imagine having a Normal Vaginal delivery. \nI would give 100% credits to Dr Vinutha Prashanth for me having a normal delivery and also a very smooth pregnancy journey.\nShe has been a pillar of support and I would blindly trust her for any medical advice in future.\nThank you so much Doctor :)",

We visited her in Ovum hospital and our first discussion with her was enough to build our confidence to stay with her for the rest of my pregnancy. We started going for regular check ups at her clinic. Through out the pregnancy, she explained each and every little thing in detail. The various tests carried out were explained elaborately. She never suggested any medicine or test  if not really required. She was very patient with all our queries and tried to clear all our doubts and concerns without any hesitation. She was always available either through call or in person. Dr Vinutha gave me confidence and fully supported my decision to go for normal vaginal delivery. \nIn my 37th week of pregnancy, my water broke without any pains. I immediately contacted her and rushed to the hospital, and within no time she was available to help me handle the situation. Even though I didn\u2019t get any contractions, she assured me that she will try her best to give me a normal delivery. I was induced with pain and after 22 hours of long labour I delivered a healthy baby boy through vaginal delivery and all thanks to Dr. Vinutha who never lost hope on me. \nI would highly recommend Dr. Vinutha for the way she guides her  patients through out the process, supports them with honest suggestions, helps them to build confidence in handling any situation and her friendly approach. Thank you Dr Vinutha for all the help that you provided us.\n",

Finally during my 3rd month, I found one with whom I consulted throughout my pregnancy. \n\nThe doctor I was consulting suggested Ovum for delivery and had given me a due date. However, we had to rush to Ovum a week earlier to the given date due to an emergency. This is when things went haywire because our doctor was on a vacation and out of Bengaluru for next few days. Myself and my husband went into panic mode instantly and this is when our doctor suggested us to take help from Dr.Vinutha. At this juncture, we were completely clueless and worried about next steps. It was already 6PM at that time.\n\nJust after a single phone conversation with Dr.Vinutha, all my doubts/anxiety were cleared and with her assurance I was ready for delivery in next few hours. It was not just me, but my husband also received similar assurance and positive messages from her. Delivery itself was very smooth and memorable experience. Post delivery, Dr.Vinutha's suggestions and care helped me take care of baby and myself seamlessly. Although my interactions with Dr.Vinutha were only for few hours before delivery, due to her cordial interactions I feel like I have known her for a long time. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr.Vinutha Prashanth for any pregnancy related consultations. Me and my husband are very grateful to her for taking care of my delivery in such a magical way! :)",

She seemed to have tons of positive review for her Devotion, Simplicity, Transparency.  \n\nOn the 1st meet/appointment, we felt very  comfortable with Dr. Vinutha. She ensured that all of our doubts, concerns, expectation were fulfilled that indeed restored the TRUST. She too believes in natural delivery unless if the medical condition requires. Doesn\u2019t prescribe a medicine, test if not really required. \n\nVisited for about 3 times before the delivery , with her experience suggested to get admitted after hearing about the early labour symptoms by 38 weeks. Admitted wife, after 12 hours wife delivered baby girl( Normal delivery \ud83d\ude0d). The pre/post delivery follow ups from her are outstanding, she was always available over to phone to help( not sure if all Dr do this) The hassle, the risk that we took all has paid off , a simple thank you wouldn\u2019t justify her effort. \n\nOver all a wonderful experience, i would recommend Dr. Vinutha for both women & child care, it\u2019s worth all your time even if you have to travel from long distance, in my case it\u2019s was electronic city. \n\nSorry about the long narration, i know how bad someone would be looking for a good Doctor & Trustworthy Hosp, user review. I have been there. \n\nA BIG Thanks again to Dr. Vinvutha\nGod Bless you more Doctor !!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

We came across Dr. Vinutha Prashanth based on a recommendation from a friend who had been visiting her for some time. When we met her for the first time we were very impressed, she clarified all our queries, listened to our problems and took her time to explain and clarify each one of them, she explained the changes that my wife will be going through and what to expect next. We decided that she was going to be our doctor for this pregnancy. This is our first child and we were many times scared and confused. She has been calm and patient with us throughout this pregnancy, from the 3rd month till post natal care. She took her time to explain every single query that we had (even trivial and insignificant ones), never in a rush to look at the next patient. She even answered our calls or messages at odd hours.\n\nDr. Vinutha helped delivered our baby, it was a normal delivery. My wife went into labor in the middle of the night, even at this odd hour she was there when we arrived at the hospital and looked at my wife immediately. And throughout the night she was either present in the hospital or was taking continuous updates from the duty doctor. She was continuously monitoring on how my wife was progressing, baby's health and kept the OT ready in case of any complications. By God's grace everything went well, both the mother and the baby are doing fine. I have Dr. Vinutha to thank for helping us sail through this beautiful (and sometimes tough) period.",

She always makes us to understand things where we are not aware or clear and helps us to take the correct decision. She will always respond to our queries either through phone call or message.\n\nWe made best decision by approaching her. Thank you ma'am for all the help and advice given by you during my pregnancy :).",

Our first consultation yielded a positive response due to her excellent attitude, approach, and handling of our case. Dr. Vinutha avoids unnecessary medications and scans, even discontinuing some medications I was unnecessarily taking.\n\nI was dealing with a history of abortions, hypothyroidism, and gestational diabetes, along with being on rest during pregnancy, Dr. Vinutha discussed the pros and cons of both vaginal and C-section delivery. She highlighted the risks of waiting until the 40th week and other potential complications. Experiencing false labor pain at the end of the 37th week, we opted for a C-section on that day, and Dr. Vinutha expertly managed the process. My baby girl was born at 4 pm, and even after delivery, Dr. Vinutha maintained constant communication, addressing problems and doubts. Her follow-up continued even after I returned home.\n\nDr. Vinutha\u2019s expertise ensured a smooth delivery, ending my five-year wait to become a mother. We are eternally grateful to her. Thank you, ma\u2019am.",

As it was my second pregnancy and I was underweight she used to list out all foods to gain weight that I could eat , during every visit , and the best thing abt ma'am is her friendliness and positive approach which makes her the best in the town..  And don't prescribe Unnecessary blood tests and scans and the best being very reasonable and affordable consultation charges for everyone. \nOverall I would say any one looking for the best delivery experience , consulting vinutha ma'am you will be in the safest hands..  \nLastly I would like to thank vinutha ma'am for helping in delivering my son safely....

She is very professional and confident, treats patients very well, clarified all the doubts throughout the pregnancy, keep in touch with patients via WhatsApp and she will find time to reply to the doubts as well (suggest not to bother her too much via WhatsApp, until unless its critical). She is more inclined towards normal deliveries until unless it's out of hand or something, best part is she won't prescribe unnecessary scans/blood tests/medicines, etc. she recommends it only if it's necessary.\n\nShe visited the hospital @4.30AM morning for the delivery at cloudnine hospital, lot of respect for her profession, as the doctor needs to visit patients in odd hours for the deliveries.\n\nSome point of time, we thought of going for c-section due to unbearable pain, However, she was very strong and confident to make it to the normal delivery (If there are chances of normal delivery, she won't let you go for c-section for sure, she actually gives confidence to you)\n\nOur pregnancy journey went smooth, and we are blessed with Baby boy via normal delivery. Baby and mother both are healthy and doing well.\n\nDear Madam, Heartfelt thanks to you and we wish all the best for your future endeavors!\n\nWith love,\nVeena Dinesh",

She meticulously monitored all aspects of the pregnancy, especially paying attention to factors like sugar levels, and provided constant guidance on the necessary steps to maintain a healthy and smooth pregnancy. She avoids unnecessary medications and scans, prioritizing a more natural and holistic approach to pregnancy. She emphasized and gave confidence of having normal delivery.\nWhat truly stood out was Dr.Vinutha\u2019s commitment to her patients. The night before the delivery, she went above and beyond by staying awake late into the night and reaching out to us through WhatsApp. Her dedication and concern were evident as she provided instructions, answered our questions, and ensured that we felt supported and informed during this crucial time.\nThank you madam for caring about me and my baby ..",

At every appointment Dr. Vinutha made sure all our queries were attended to and any follow up tests were completed. She did not recommend any unnecessary tests/scans or medications . We faced a couple of hiccups during our pregnancy journey which did get us worried, but Dr. Vinutha was always there to explain everything very patiently and transparently. She never forced her decisions upon us rather empowered us with knowledge and made us a part of the decision making process. She made the entire birth experience exactly what I was hoping for. She was calm and encouraging during delivery. She provided me with utmost support and guided me at every step she was taking. This resulted in a very positive birthing experience for me. Such a patient, clear-headed doctor is a rare find and I am blessed to have found her. I appreciated her care over these past nine months which made the whole ride much less stressful. Would highly recommend!",

So far i have met almost 10 gynaecologists (in Bangalore and in Kerala) and without any doubt i can say that you are the bestest. \nMy first delivery experience was not so good. So i was too worried this time before each and every consultation. But i must say that after your each consultation, you made me happy,confident and tension free. You always keen to listen to me patiently. I recall most of the time you read my face and asked me to know about the concerns. And the confidence with which you say (200%) made me think positive and were always confident on normal delivery.\nNow with blessings of God and support from you, we are proud to have our second kid and we named her Charvi \nThanks from Akhila and Sujith",

She is just one call away for her patients. She gave me mental strength and because of her I was able to work till 9 months.

I had horrible experience during my first pregnancy with a different Gynaecologist but this time my pregnancy journey went so smooth. Thanks a ton to Vinutha Ma\u2019am.

Most of the reports she asks to share on whatsApp instead of asking us to come again for the same. \n\t\u2022 She always encourages normal delivery and she is greatest blessing to us for our normal delivery. \n\t\u2022 We always had that positive vibes every time we met her. She is an angel down to earth (As a person than Doctor). Even in the labour room, We felt so much relaxed after seeing her despite of the pain my wife was going through. She was the one whom we could blindly trust. \n\t\u2022 We are very glad and thankful to God that we ever met her.

Then my brother Naveen.N.Goutham searched on practo and suggested Dr.Vinutha's name.  \nWe visited to the Divine Clinic. I was scared for getting IVF treatment because of its injections and all.  She explained pros and cons of the IVF treatment. She didn't hide any risks involved in the treatment. \nVinutha madam personally guided me as a friend and filled me with positivity towards the treatment. Only with her support I could dared to get the treatment done. And now I am having two kids Hale & Hearty.\nThrough out the journey she was very positive and she had put her 100% effort and helped us to conceive. She also treated as a family member & took care personally during pregnancy as well as delivery.\nI would like to thank Dr.Vinutha as it was like a rebirth for me and I will also recommend her name as an experience gynaecologist to others.",

She congratulated us and gave us a few tips. At last she said that \"This is your last visit, keep in touch\".

By vinutha mam guidance we have our first child at cloudnine hospital and its a normal delivery. Its my first pregnancy, we got the best doctor in the town. From the conformation of my pregnancy till the post delivery, its been a very smooth journey with vinutha mam. She accepts the patients as they are and never complain back, always welcome will her great and simple smile. She gets emotionally attached and hence we feel like sharing our thoughts with our family member. She also explains and make us understand the health issues so well that we will be educated about the things very well. I delivered my baby at 4.44 in the evening and  after my delivery I got a heavy bleeding she immediately took a family consent and took me to OT and operated me. I was in a observation till 9 pm after shifting me to the ward she came and meet me ,  vinutha mam checked how am I doing, she was very helpful and explained my family what are the consequences gone through. All thanks to Dr. vinutha Prashanth mam for guiding me in the best part of my life. Because of Dr Vinutha I and my baby are safe and healthy today. \nRegards, \nAnusha and Adarsh.",

The clinic atmosphere is kept very healthy and positive which motivates every visitor feel good about their visit.\nMy pregnancy journey has been very smooth because of Vinutha mam. She always treated me to be a healthy and strong mother. I have asked every little doubts I get during my journey to her and she has always been sweet to explain me the process and make me understand the pregnancy in a better way. \nI delivered a healthy Baby Girl on Dec 12th and all thanks to Dr.Vinutha Prashanth. She made sure that my husband and my family members knew every update during my labor. My family is also very happy and glad to have met such genuine doctor in these times.

She's an intelligent doctor with human values.\n\nI regularly visited her clinic from the day 1 till the end, it's a well maintained place.\n\nThe first impression about my doctor was her friendliness. That gave me more comfort to ask or talk anything.. Her confidence and energy made everything look easier for me And she explains everything in detail like what are the procedures, why those tests and scans are required and clears any doubts related to pregnancy. And she was always available to get in touch by phone. \n\nI always feel like she's my sister. I exactly did what she told me to. I never had any complication or tough times through out my pregnancy. And that's the best part when you get a nice gynaec like her. \n\nThough she tried for normal, I successfully delivered my baby girl via C sec, since I had little complication during labor.. But I never regret for what I went through.. I'm so lucky to get a good doctor like her in my life.. I still miss those regular visits and those lovely talks ma'am.. Can't thank you enough.\n\nI already reffered her to my friends. They are also happy with her treatment. I would highly recommend her.. \n",

Most important thing for the mothers is to have a doctor who is readily available over a msg/call incase of any emergencies or doubts. Dr vinutha have been very helpful and supportive in that case and was available even during odd hours. Since it was my first pregnancy I was damm scared thinking about the delivery, but she made me calm and comfortable specially during the OT and informed each and every staff to be extra sensitive towards me. She is one of the doctor who tries for normal delivery till the last second. Even in my case, I didn't get labour until my 39th week, so we tried to induce the artificially entire night twice. But since my fluid level was dropping and labour wasn't induced, so we took the call to have c section. \nInitially was quite scared in OT, but within few minutes I was done with the delivery and was blessed with a baby girl.\nDr vinutha is quite friendly and without hesitation you can ask her anything, she won't judge like other few doctors.

Most importantly she never suggests unnecessary scans or medicines. Every scans/blood work to be done is explained by doctor nicely and every small doubt will be cleared. She is just a call/msg away during emergency. \n\nShe suggested exercises walking and diet during pregnancy which made the pregnancy journey easier and helpful for delivery. I delivered my baby boy in Cloudnine, normal vaginal delivery done by Vinutha ma\u2019am. Right from the beginning she motivated us and till the discharge she took care of me, visited to check up on me even after delivery. \n\nThank you so much Vinutha ma\u2019am for everything, you are a wonderful doctor one can have during their pregnancy and delivery.

I have become mom on 28th Oct for a cute little hero, a moment that I have been waiting for almost 4 years! After going through a rough ride for first 3 years i had very little hopes on this pregnancy until I met Vinutha Ma'm during our first meet itself she reassured us and I still remember she saying our priority is not just delivering a baby but a healthy baby and Mom, that made me feel that I'm in safe hands, because of my previous experiences I was always anxious, scared, nervous but for any of my questions or doubt at any time of the day Dr. Vinutha was just a phone call away, i must say it is god's grace and our destiny that took us to Dr. Vinutha Ma'm. I feel lucky and blessed today for being with my baby and l celebrating the motherhood, all thanks to Dr. Vinutha Ma'm.\n\nAlso, the team Cloudnine has been very supportive, friendly a huge thanks to the entire team for taking such a good care of me and baby..\n\nThank you, \nSushma KR",

After our 1st consulatation, we were very much satisfied with the way she conveyed about the process. She is very friendly, down to earth and always gives clarity about each process. Also she makes sure that your money is not wasted on the unnecessary scans/tests.  Going further, we got to know that the fetus is small from the growth scan and we were nervous on the outcome but doctor really encouraged and strengthened us. She took complete responsibility and regularly monitored the growth of the fetus from 7th month till end of 38th week with regular scans and NST tests only when required. The fluid was reduced in 37th week and she still tried her best to push the delivery to 38th week to make sure that baby shouldn't have further complications after delivery. She tried her best for the normal delivery by inducing pain but since I did not get pain, I opted for the c-section. With Gods grace and with such a wonderful Doctor, I'm blessed with a Baby boy on 6th October. Myself and baby both are doing good now. I would really thank Vinutha mam from my bottom of the heart for such a wonderful experience throughout this journey. ",

We had choosen her from online reviews and gone with a positive hope but which was worth it today. She always welcomes with smile. During nine months of pregency i had a normal checkups, scans and no complication. She will suggest only tests and scans required based on individuals. She focus more on normal delivery rather than going up for c-sec. Labour pain started at 12am but waited in home some hours then went to hospital. Actually I was shouting at the top of my voice but doctor didn't lose patience and she made me to understand about the situation. We mentally fine opting c-sec because I was not able to control the pain. But she is not ready to go for c-sec when normal delivery is happening. At last by God's grace and doctor's advice I delivered a baby girl with normal delivery on 9th of September 2022. We are very happy with the things doctor deal with and make us more comfortable. Thanks to Dr. Vinutha mam and team of cloudnine for making the smooth delivery. Loads of love from our family\u2764\ufe0f",

She is always available for any kind of queries via Phone or WhatsApp.  We always felt we are meeting a family member who is always there for us throughout this journey and who is concerned about our well-being every time we met her.\nShe is also a very good decision maker.   Her experience and diagnostic skills are commendable. Her down to earth nature makes her the best Doctor. Best thing about her is she never over prescribes anything. \nAll tests and Lab reports were shared via whatsapp ,which would indeed save lots of time and consultation fees for the patients. she used to check those reports and would call us for consultation only if there is anything emergency. \nCouple of times when we visited hospitals late night due to labor pain , she was always in touch with duty doctor to ensure everything is fine and used to keep track of all minute details. \nWe are out of the words, and we wish all future Mom\u2019s would get a Doctor like her.\nThanks Dr Vinutha \ud83d\ude0a\n",

Mine was a high risk pregnancy due to age. At each stage mam explained in detail why each test was carried out why each prescribed tablets were given what are the probable risks and how she is making sure that the  all risks are assessed. \nAt the very end of the pregnancy she suspected that baby growth is not as much as it should have been and the baby is going to be a preterm baby. First of all her kind words and clear instructions made us gather courage after the news. she did all possible precautions by providing steroids injection for lungs development to having scans and nst tests at regular intervals to the best of her ability to make sure the baby arrived safe. We are lucky to have found you as our doctor. I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart for the care that you provided to us in the entire process.

So we had decided to visit this clinic once for the experience and it was very good start. After couple of months of medication which she prescribed we got positive result.\n\nThe journey began with routine monthly examinations, prescriptions, and scans. She used to explain to us the purpose of the tests and scans for the mother or the unborn child, so none were unnecessary.\n\nWe used to notice Dr.'s friendliness, calmness, and energy at every visit. For my wife, she was actually like a friend.\n\nShe was available at any point of time on call when it comes to emergency and used to monitor my wife and my baby's development and movements closely.\n\nBeing her first delivery, my wife was a little nervous, but the doctor gave her confidence and strength.\n\nAnd YES!! On 20th August 2022, We were blessed with Healthy cute little Baby Boy (Our bundle of Joy).\n\nThis is my honest review to Dr. Vinutha Ma\u2019am.\n\nI would definitely recommend my family or my friends to this clinic.",

Had previously visited another private hospital where the gynecologist was only concerned about money and treated pregnancy as some kind of disease. But, when we visited Dr. Vinuta, she neatly explained everything and how I could be my normal self with mine considered to be as low-risk pregnancy. She was extremely friendly and made us feel extremely comfortable. She motivated me to be active which was very helpful during my labor. Though I was very much active and did every exercise that I was asked to, during pregnancy, I didn't get pains. As mine was considered to be low risk pregnancy, doctor was willing to wait for 40 + 5days. Unfortunately, the pain didn't come naturally and my induction was scheduled on 40 + 5th day. After 33 of on and off pains, the frustration of not being able to progress further led to the decision of opting for C section. But, doctor Vinuta wanted motivated us go for normal delivery and didn't want our effort of having a normal vaginal delivery to go in vain. With her motivation, guidance and determination I was delivered my baby boy normally after 38 hours. \ud83d\ude04 for anyone out there looking for **** gynecologist for your motherhood journey, she is the one! Very thankful for you, doctor! \ud83d\ude07",

She introduced us to dr Babitha who was an endocrinologist to help us tackle diabetes.\n\nDr Vinutha gave us lot of confidence and we are now blessed with a baby girl who was born without any complications with the help of Vinutha doctor\n\nWe are ever great full to her for her support and friendly nature which made us very comfortable to talk openly and contact her anytime of the day if we faced any issues\n\nEven in a high risk pregnancy she recommends normal delivery only and she recommends natural diet rather than artificial supplements.\n\nWe highly recommend dr Vinutha Prashanth for people looking for a good and friendly And approachable doctor\n\nThanks\nJagadeesh",

All my queries were patiently answered and she took her time to understand my case history. Throughout the course of my pregnancy, I was not put through any unnecessary scans, lab work or medications. All I had to do was practice Yoga and take a few supplements. That's it !! Whenever I had late night panicked moments I would Whatsapp the doctor and she would always get back to me. She always instilled the confidence that I was healthy and the baby was developing well. Such positive reinforcement helped me tremendously !!! When it was time for me to deliver the baby, she was there coaching me through the entire process and we welcomed our lovely baby girl <3. I had a normal delivery and it was seamless. However, as luck would have it, I had postpartum hemorrhage. Dr Vinutha and her team quickly swung into action and contained it. Throughout the recovery, be it 11 am or 11 pm, she was constantly checking up on me. I couldn't have asked for a better doctor to take care of me through my pregnancy and post delivery. My deepest heartfelt gratitude to her!!! I 100% recommend Dr Vinutha :) ",

There\u2019s still hope ! Thanks to Dr. Vinutha. My wife and I had been to multiple hospitals and to the most renowned doctors in Bangalore, but were never satisfied. All we got in return were questions off checklists and bookish advice (with one eye on the clock). The first time we met Dr. Vinutha, we were extremely satisfied and all our anguish was laid to rest. She very patiently listened to us and gave us some extremely good advice. Throughout the pregnancy she was a tremendous source of encouragement and support. She also voluntarily offered us her phone number and asked us to call her any time of the day or night for any emergencies or concerns. She became almost like family and my wife was extremely comfortable with her during the final stages of her pregnancy. The delivery was successful and we have been blessed with a beautiful baby. Dr. Vinutha ensured that we had a great experience and has been simply fantastic! We need more such doctors. \nStrongly recommend Dr. Vinutha to one and all, even if you are consulting with any other doctor. \nSpeak to her just once and judge for yourselves! \n\nThank you Dr. Vinutha. ****** *** ***** ",

We have come across many doctors in our life but Vinutha mam is the best doctor who is very humble, soft spoken and proficient in her field\u2026 She was available 24*7 to respond to all your queries\u2026 We have seen no other doctor being so ethical and committed till date.. No unnecessary scans, medicines etc. She was very patient to answer all of our queries no matter how silly they were. I had an emergency condition where my BP shoot up badly and when contacted during midnight she asked us to rush to hsptl immediately and we found her waiting with wheel chair even before we reached. That is the level of commitment she has towards her patient.We will definitely miss the interactions we were having with her. She is more of a family to us than a doctor now.We are very much grateful to Vinutha mam for the overall experience\u2026.Lastly 5 star rating to Vinutha mam is not sufficient as she deserves infinite stars to the excellent service she is doing.. You're the best mam!!",

I visited Divine Health Clinic she confirmed my pregnancy at 5 weeks and I have been consulting with her till my delivery. I delivered my first child by normal vaginal delivery with her full guidance and support. Any time I have ever had a question or concern, she has laid out all the pros/cons, risks & benefits for me clearly and thoroughly. She kept me on required prenatal vitamins and minimal scans during my pregnancy. All my vaccines, blood tests was done at Divine Clinic itself. She advised diet and exercise plan.  She has been responsive during all times. When my water broke at 39 weeks, she very patiently told us to go to the hospital without any panic. She was there with me right from the start of my contractions - monitoring me at regular intervals and fully supported and motivated me, my husband and my entire family throughout. Post delivery she followed up every day on my healing. She is the very best combination of medical expertise, and unmatched compassion and advice. I trust her 100%.",

All the positive reviews about her made me very confident to consult her and I'm glad about the decision I made.Consulted her at Divine clinic,Banashankari. She never recommended any unnecessary scans or medications.Explained the necessity of every scan and blood test very clearly before getting it done. She is very approachable. She would reply to all the queries anytime of the day without any delay. Very friendly doctor, treated me like one of her  family members which made me very comfortable.  Coming to the delivery part, I got admitted to the hospital in the midnight at around 12:30. She came to the hospital and kept monitoring my condition the whole night and finally delivered baby girl in the morning at 5:55,it was a normal delivery. Very difficult to find such  doctors these days and I'm lucky to have found one.\nHappy to recommend her to all the expectant mothers.",

She throughout handheld us with confidence and was extremely empathetic and very understanding. Not to exaggerate but just like how a mother or an elder sister would behave, she was extremely friendly and explained us in detail what needs to be done and what not. She avoided unnecessary scans unlike others and prescribed scans only when required. Ask any number of questions to her and raise your concerns, she will be extremely patient and clarify your doubts in detail. \n\n I also want to tell that during internals, she was extremely patient, understanding and did not hurry up and gave time. \n\nAlso during labour, she kept giving confidence and was very respectful even when i was not cooperative, she with her comforting words helped me brace the situation. \n\nThis review is no where exaggerated. She is extremely service oriented and i had the best delivery experience. She delivered our beautiful baby girl and I'm more than grateful to her for all that she has done through our pregnancy journey, through labour and delivery. She is certainly one of a kind \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI would recommend her to every body i know. Not one complaint from my side. Just heartfelt gratitude from my family to hers. \n\nMay her tribe of doctors grow \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\n\n",

She takes utmost care and is very responsible when it comes to her patient. Mine was a high risk pregnancy and we did have to go through a few tough situations during our journey but Dr.Vinutha made the path easier for us by taking all the worries on herself. She doesn't treat her patient as a 'case' but takes it personally and makes sure that she is very well aware of the condition of the patient. Many doctors nowadays aren't available during odd hours rather they give the contact of hospitals to connect with in case of emergencies but Dr.Vinutha is available 24 X 7. Its very rare to find such dedicated doctors who do not commercialize their service but do it out of sheer will. I am really thankful to Dr.Vinutha for bringing joy into our life and will always be greatful to her. She definitely is the most recommended doctor especially for high risk pregnancy. ",

But, you can get a fair idea of your doctor\u2019s approach to care and how she responds in certain situations.So, happily I can say we have cleared the zone 1 of pregnancy, by meeting an excellent doc Dr. Vinutha. \n\nEven thou it's our first pregnancy,right from Day 1 of our visit,Dr.Vinutha made us very comfortable and open to questions even the silliest of all. \n\nWe had few compilations , and the conversation with Dr. Vinutha made us ease the situation and she explained the situation very well and extra caution was taken at each step to make our pregnancy smooth, and the best thing is that she follows the protocol, which will rule out the doubts which we will have in our mind. \n\nGetting a best doctor, especially gynec is at most important for anyone during pregnancy. We have found one, and waiting for our lil one with an amazing anticipation . \n\nThank you Dr. Vinutha for making our pregnancy a Cake walk. ",

We found out good feedback for Dr. Vinutha Prashant on Practo and clinic was near to my place. Hence, we thought of visiting once and decide further. Very first meet itself, we felt very positive and comfortable about her. She is very friendly and prompt in what she advises. *** ***** ******* *********** ********** ******** ** ****** She was always boosting confidence and encouraging me to continue working along with proper care and exercises which helps for easy delivery. She made my pregnancy journey smooth. She is very much approachable for any concerns at any time, that's the great thing that she gave her precious time and attention to her patients. I got my labor pain in midnight, we gave her a call and she asked to reach the hospital soon. By the time we reach, staffs were already informed to start the preliminary checks and she rushed to hospital immediately and motivated me to be strong in the process and consoling me when required. Post delivery also, she promptly visited and examined my condition. We are very much happy that we made a right decision to consult Vinutha madam and definitely recommend her.

Lab tests and scanning was prescribed at regular intervals to access the growth of my baby.\n\nConsidering the pandemic situation, I was guided to choose and opt the right hospital for delivery keeping in mind the safety of my baby.After 39 weeks of my pregnancy, I got labor pain and had to rush to hospital in wee hours. In no time, Dr. Vinutha reached the hospital and was beside me. She kept motivating me and within an hour, I delivered a healthy baby boy normally (without vaccum or forceps usage) and I was extremely happy to see my baby in her safe hands.\n\nI liked Dr. Vinutha for her patience, politeness, reachability, expertise and passion towards work. She is a wonderful human being God has created who helps to bring the  bundle of joy into this world and I would like to thank her again for all the care and love she has shown me.\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Vinutha to my friends and relatives.",

She develops enormous trust with the patient and family right from the first conversation.\n2. She listens to understand our concerns and patiently explains the issue at hand, potential root causes, the recommended solution and alternatives, potential risks/side effects of the chosen solution, and next steps in the direction of cure\n3. She is available on phone for any clarification, small or big - Knowing that the doctor you are consulting is a message or a call away is a big win for anyone.\n4. She is very well mannered, extremely soft spoken and retains composure at all times - Hallmark of a top notch professional\n5. She delivers on her promise of the best in class treatment\n6. She continues to check in on the progress being made and does so with unfailing regularity.\n\nDr Vinutha is the gynaecologist we all need and deserve. You choose her and are in the safest pair of hands.\n\nI, my wife and family have nothing but gratitude to express to her service.\n\nNote: We had an issue accidentally diagnosed via an MRI and later confirmed through an ultrasound scan. This required a open procedure that Dr Vinutha and team performed two days ago. This review is written after we got discharged on Wednesday, 9th June",

My baby had late stage IUGR and was monitored every week in the 8th month for his growth, which would make me feel tensed but \nher words always assured me that my baby is ok, and will be delivered with no problem. I being obese never ever thought that I will have a normal delivery and also with my baby having IUGR, \nI considered c-section is the only go, but doctor Vinutha always gave me a hope of normal delivery.\nI cannot thank her enough for her care and concern, when I was admitted instead of just asking duty doctor how i was, she herself visited me every 4 hrs to check upon me.\n I did not have any pain though whole day had passed, but Dr.Vinutha patiently waited and her patience with me is commendable, when I didnt deliver even by night 11PM,she decided to stay back in the hospital for me all night long. I delivered my baby normally the next day early morning.\nAll thanks to Dr.Vinutha. I would suggest her to anyone looking for a caring supportive doctor for their journey of Pregnancy.\n\n\n",

I used to travel 28 kms one way to meet her till 8 th month in two wheeler with my husband and that will power was given by her. It was a normal delivery for me which I thought was impossible. her advise on doing yoga, diet plan and positive attitude helped me. I delivered a healthy baby with no health concerns and totally am healthy today. any point of time she is approachable. friendly person, very down to earth. will miss her ever smiling face. there is no attitude in her talk even if she knows so much. 24/7 doctor was available in calls and texts, more than doctor I felt I was meeting a friend every month. the tablets and tests prescribed by her was reasonable.  I was scared of normal delivery and even asked for a csec but it was vinutha who knew what is the best for me. today I am healthy and blessed with a girl child and true saying doctors are god's in disguise and it's true after meeting her. even when I came for consultation hardly I had to wait to meet her and she was available always. lastly a hearty thanks you Dr Vinutha Prashanth, *** *** *** **** **** god bless you in good health and you reach much more heights in your journey. my baby is lucky to be born in your hand.",

We went through a few gynecologist profiles for consultation and surprisingly found that Dr Vinutha had the highest review. It was one of the best decisions made to consult her! The whole 39 weeks went like a breeze. Dr Vinutha is very supportive and available 24x7 for any doubts. Touchwood, the whole experience of pregnancy was really good until last few days wherein I had few common issues like stuffy nose, body itching. She made me go through it very easily. On the day of admission, after two unsuccessful attempts to induce pain, we decided to opt for a c-sec. It was the best decision collectively, as the baby was on the healthier side(~4kgs) and the fluid content was high. She did not give false hopes about delivery procedure and explained every step and possibilities in detail.In a nutshell, the whole experience with Dr Vinutha is a blessing for us. I would certainly recommend her with utmost confidence for a pleasant and enjoyable pregnancy. Thank you doctor! \ud83d\ude0a",

This was our first baby and as a new parents to be we had a lot of questions and we found Dr. Vinutha during the lockdown and she happened to be answer to all our questions and taking away our apprehensions too. She had been very informative and guided us in the right direction throughout the pregnancy phase. Although there weren't much of complications but we were still worried about normal delivery in the world of c-section. Dr. Vinutha had been very pleasant and she was approachable and available whenever we needed help/assistance. Based on how she guided us shows the enormous knowledge and experience she carries in her profession which is to be seen in very few who are in the same profession as her. Finally the day arrived and I was admitted at Ovum - Banashankari. It took a humongous effort and time before my daughter arrived, a lot of patience shown by Dr. Vinutha was commendable as she did not rush me to the labor or advised me to get a c-section for a less painful process. Instead she took all the efforts and showed a lot of patience for over a day before she finally delivered my daughter. The kind of patience and efforts taken by Dr. Vinutha was commendable, our family and I are very happy with the way the whole process went through. Thank you Dr. Vinutha!\nRegards,\nPrathima and Raja",

I was wanting normal delivery from beginning. 40th week Dr Vinutha had done internal checking which was very painful for me. My water broke before labour pain started. Dr Vinutha suggested she would wait for pain to come. Now when actual labour pain started I lost my confidence of going for normal delivery completely as the pain was too severe. I requested the doctor also that the pain is very severe and I would like to go for cesarean delivery. However Dr Vinutha checked my bp and baby heart rate also which was normal. Dr Vinutha recommended to wait for pain to come fully and give time to dilate fully. Anyway after 8 hours of pain I could delivery my baby successfully through normal delivery only which I think could not be done without support from Dr Vinutha. I feel she is one of a doctor who would wait for the last moment before going for cesarean. Nobody could ignore the benefits of normal delivery as I could start walking from next day and hold my baby. My special thanks to Dr Vinutha though at time I also thought she was too strict to go for normal delivery when I had requested for cesarean, however at the end of the day that really helped me to recover so quickly.",

I still remember the words  \u201cDon\u2019t over think ,cross the bridge when you arrive there\u201d .\nDuring last trimester in this pandemic situation,I was really worried .\nI can say my journey in this situation was cake walk under Vinutha ma\u2019am guidance.\n\nUntil my last push of the baby she was very supportive and understanding both emotionally and physically.\n\nLoads of thanks to you Ma\u2019am.\n\n",

I am in U.S right now and my wife is  in India. Until 7 months we were visiting Vinutha Mam in the Ovum hospital, she was so caring, humble and given right direction *** ******** ********* ***** ***********\n\nMy wife went to her native near Mysore after 7th month. She been to one of the best private hospital in Mysore to takecare off. After 8th month one day they said, they have to do C-Section and need to operate in a week and keep baby in ICU. That was a calamity to us.\n\nThen immediately we called Vinutha Mam and explained to her, She is an angel who guided us and asked her to come back to bangalore. Thereafter it's an easy going, she has taken care of her like a mother. she use to call, message everyday twice and talk to her and giving her moral strength.\n\nFinally, We got normal delivery now at 37th month, :) both baby and mother are doing good.  I appreciate and sincerely thank to Vinutha Mam.  \n\n-Raju",

Their warm and approachable nature made each visit a positive experience, fostering a comfortable environment during a crucial time.\n\nAfter delivery, the friendly behavior continued to shine. The gynaecologist's support during labor was accompanied by reassuring words and a comforting presence. Postpartum care has been marked by their friendly check-ins, creating a supportive atmosphere that extends beyond medical expertise. I wholeheartedly recommend this gynaecologist for their exceptional skills and friendly approach, ensuring a genuinely positive journey through pregnancy and delivery.",

One fine day we just dropped in not knowing what to do or whether to trust anyone these days especially while the medical scams are making patients poor and medical practitioners prosperous. Our journey with this genuinely concerned doctor started there.\n\nWe really felt like We are being listened too and understood. She doesn\u2019t come over with a preconceived notion about the patient and their problems and as if she automatically knows what is best for us.\n\nShe took time to address our concerns in way that acknowledges our feelings but also presented us with the ground reality and practicality.  She educated us about what to expect, what was considered normal, and what to look out for during each appointment. She never made us feel uncomfortable or bad for asking so many questions. Every time we met her she made us feel like we are her only patient. And every other of her patients we met had same opinion about her.\n\nHer staff also represent her well.\n\nWhen I tell you she is an amazing doctor I\u2019m not lying. I seriously would follow her anywhere. You can\u2019t find more of a genuine soul and doctor that truly cares about your needs. We were sure that we were in good hands from the get go. We are terrified of having to find a new obgyn.\n\nHard to find all of these qualities in an Doctor these days at the price point Hundred times of her professional fees!",

Her personal number was available online. She was very cordial and professional. She assured us that her first preference is to have normal delivery. She also explained us the circumstances where we have to go for C-section. Whenever scanning is to be done outside, we were sending the report through WhatsApp and she was giving her advice, thereby avoiding having an appointment with the doctor and going to the hospital.\n\nWe had normal delivery at Ovum hospital which was done by Dr Varna Rao, again excellent doctor and human being, as Dr Vinutha Prashanth was out of station. Our experience with Dr Vinutha Prashanth was excellent and we thank her and Dr Varna Rao for their support and service.She was available at any time over phone for clarifications which made us feel comfortable staying at house.On the delivery date (which happened 11 days before due date) she was out of station and Dr Varna Rao did the normal delivery. Throughout the delivery process constantly in touch with us and the doctor and ensured that everything went fine. Immediately on return from out of station, she directly came to hospital to see the baby and mother. It was like having a close friend to treat us instead of some doctor.",

I had previous history of IUFD and Dr.Vinutha has guided me with all the right steps for medication and all required tests/scans time to time to make sure we don\u2019t miss anything during the entire pregnancy course. She made me stronger mentally and prepare me for my big day by giving positive thoughts and insights and remove all my fear/anxiety whenever I visited her. She would always listen to my opinions and provide right feedback. Also, Dr.Vinutha was always available through phone/whatsapp and would always reply to questions asked anytime. Finally I delivered a healthy baby.\nI would like to thank and highly recommend Dr.Vinutha for the pre and post pregnancy care.",

I was advised to be on complete bed rest and unfortunately I had to be admitted to hospital again and this continued for over a month. she was always available on phone, whatsApp in whichever medium I wanted to contact her.  She constantly monitored mine and my baby's health and was a great support system throughout the pregnancy. Finally, I delivered a healthy baby on completing 35 weeks and i can't thank her enough for all that she has done. I would highly recommend her for any consultation, be it pregnancy or pcod etc. most humble and empathetic doctor I have seen till date. ",

She was always a phone call away in case of any doubts or emergency.  Explains everything in detail and avoids unnecessary tests, scans and medicines. Mine was a twin pregnancy which was high risk. I had to get admitted to the hospital 2 weeks before my delivery due to some risk. During my entire stay she was visiting me everyday without fail and asked to monitor my condition to the duty doctors in the hospital and got an update from them every few hours. She took utmost care and delivered my babies. Even after delivery she was in constant touch and got updates about mine and babies health.  We are very grateful to Dr Vinutha Prashanth. Thank you so much for your care and help throughout my pregnancy",

I was so scared and tensed but doctor supported me throughout my pregnancy. I was admitted to the hospital by previous night 10:30pm she visited me there as soon as I got admitted and started treatment. She has tried for a normal delivery till the next day afternoon. But I didn't get any pain so undergone for a c-section and blessed with a baby boy. Even in the operation theater she explained me the situation and gave me hope. Even after delivery she was monitoring me each and every day till my discharge. I strongly recommend Dr.Vinutha Prashanth not only for pregnancy but for all the women's health problems. \nThank you so much doctor",

She didn\u2019t prescribe any unnecessary medicines either. And always clarified all doubts me and my spouse had with patience.

We could not have asked for a better doctor, and have already started suggesting her to some of our friends.",

Ma'am was very helpful in making us understand what needs to be done and how I have to take care of myself and the baby throughout the pregnancy. She always suggests what Is best for the patient rather than prescribing unnecessary scans and medicine. During all our visit there she always explained all aspect of my pregnancy very patiently and also gave us reassurance and she was always there with us. After every visit we used to be filled with positivity.\nI am actually pain sensitive person, but the way she supported and guided during my normal delivery was very much commendable. She doesn\u2019t push people for CS like some doctors in Bangalore and will always push for Normal delivery. She even constantly checks on her patient during her off time\nWe highly recommend Dr. Vinutha ma'am. *** ** *** ****\n",

Moreover She is also always contactable beyond scheduled visits should you have any questions or concerns throughout the treatment. Nowadays difficult to find the good doctor in Bangalore city. After visiting Divine clinic we got to know, still good doctors are there but we have to search them carefully through social media. Clinic is amazing and maintained very well. I would like to recommend this clinic and Doctor for all my family and friends without any Choice. Finally, Thank you so much mam for your dedication towards patients care.",

With utmost care and concern she handlelled all my queries patiently and resolved them.. with utmost ease and my complete satisfaction. It's very very hard to find doctors who listens and care for their patients so much..The best part was that she was not intrested in any extra medical formalities, unecessary tests... or extra expenditure. Her mantra was to keep things simple.. and here, now... I am a proud amd fit mother of my beautiful Lil baby girl! All thanks to Dr. Vinutha for making my pregnancy so smooth for me! All those who do not know which Gynac to go for... Just book ur appointment with her. I am vouching for it that u won't regret! ",

She listens carefully and will explain clearly and is highly knowledgeable.Me and my husband were  impressed by the way she talks and explain things. \n\nI had made up my mind for a normal delivery but things did not go well with my health issues  but still dr vinutha made it possible to deliver a healthy baby in my hands\nshe takes time to explain every minute stuff so that we are aware what exactly is happening and why and also. she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. And she will never ask you to go for unnecessary tests/scans.\n\nGlad we met you mam. It was a smooth journey in my last days of delivering the baby. Thank you doctor Vinutha \ud83d\ude4f",

I felt very intrigued by the apt explanations given by her for all my questions which not only cleared my doubts but also gave a lot of perspective and made sense. Her clear assesment of situation made me have a safe pregnancy and healthy baby by the end of it. I love her practical approach to issues. The friendliness and warmth she met me with made my pregnancy journey even better for me and my husband.\n\nDr Vinutha is amazing at her job and I would definitely suggest her to every mother to be.\ud83d\ude0a",

At every stage of progress during pregnancy, mam clearly explained what\u2019s happening with the baby, what checks/scans we need to do and why we do it. Due to a medical condition my wife had to be admitted late night twice at 1 pm during 9th month and mam was available throughout to guide the duty doc on todos. She very patiently detailed the medical condition and the necessity to go for a caesarian delivery. We got blessed with baby girl. If your thoughts resonate with mine - \u2018Im looking for a doc who would help me to navigate through the pregnancy with trust and confidence\u2019 then I highly recommend Dr. Vinutha Prasanth. ",

One of the special qualities of Dr. Vinutha which I would like to call out that she is really proactive and anticipate things very well and gives so much time to patients.  This helped me immensely during pregnancy.\nThanks Doctor for going above and beyond your duty for patients. All the best, keep shining!!",

She would always be available through calls or WhatsApp to answer to any queries at any time. \nMy surgery went smoothly and within 4 days I was able to do my basic activities like cooking, walking, etc. She advised me not to bend or lift any heavy things and to avoid exercises for 3 to 4 months. I am happy that she has taken good care of me. Her receptionist Radhika is also very supportive and kind. I therefore thank doctor and Radhika for the support and care.",

I badly needed a good doctor and hospital that's where Dr Vinutha was refered by one of my friend , In my first visit only doctor gave her phone number and told you can call me or any issues or clarification. First time i got the phone number and a friendly doctor who cares a lot . Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient !!!!!!",

She is true to herself and with a divine personality. She always encourages for normal delivery right from the beginning. She treats her patients like her own family, fills in positivity in them, stands by them like a rock solid and is always reachable which is enough for a patient to fight through any medical condition. We feel lucky to be able to find a doctor like her and would definitely recommend my friends and family. Thank you so much mam for the great service.",

Dr.Vinutha was brilliant in guiding each and every step of pregnancy and without doubt, she is a best gynecologist. Her concern towards me and baby after delivery was par excellence. Usually it is quite difficult to reach doctors outside the working time. But Dr.Vinutha was reachable anytime and infact she took her time out to reach us to enquire about our health when we didn't do assuming she could be busy. I highly recommend Doctor for every pregnant women. We just can't THANK enough.. Thank you Doctor. You are the best!",

Every single checkup was hastle free, it never took much waiting time. She will take extra time to explain the need of each scan or the blood test to be done. One main thing which I liked about her was she will never make you spend money on scans or tests unnecessarily. \n\nEven in the OT while operating, she was talking to me so well which helped me a lot. She was always reachable over WhatsApp or calls. She never got irritated or annoyed with my doubts, she happily explained each and everything.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience visiting her and I'm happy about it. \n",

After delivery Dr.Vinutha also took care of my baby's health by checking up on baby's health updates as my baby was in NICU for one day. I couldn't just express in words how much Dr.Vinutha has supported me over my pregnancy journey to keep myself healthy physically and mentally  and with healthy baby. Thanks for all you have done Doctor. It's very hard to find doctor with ethics like you. I'm very grateful to you. ",

Our journey started with Mam from 6th month of pregnancy and we are happy that we choose the right person. The best part of Mam is her patience to talk with patients. She explains everything clearly and always she suggested my wife to do yoga and household work which helped my wife to have a normal delivery.On labor day, Mam waited nearly 20 hours to happen normal delivery for my wife and she was continously monitoring. We were not able to see my wife pain, but doctor was having confidence that it will be a normal delivery and keep on providing us mental strength. After long waiting time of labor, my wife gave birth to boy through normal delivery. I highly recommend others to choose Dr. Vinutha Mam for pregnancy treatment.Thanks a lot Mam.",

We had no reviews or recommendations. But We are so thankful for that ovum ad which led us straight to Dr Vinutha. She is that doctor who belongs to the ideal types. She has everything one would look for in a doctor. With her guidance and treatment, my wife delivered (normal) on 4th Jan 2019 and the second delivery (normal) on 4th May 2021. ****** *** *** *** ****. Keep up all the good work you are doing.

I was doubtful about the benefit of a telephone consultation but we have made a clear pathway for further consideration of our mother\u2019s condition. She advised us very well.

During the delivery, I was insistent on Epidural, but she pushed my to go all natural and I must say, I am very pleased with her approach. She did not prescribe any unnecessary medicines and asked me to go all natural - which is great. She was available at all times on phone for any queries and she would respond on whatsapp for any follow up queries on reports and scans.

But when due to some complications, it wasn't possible, she helped us wait till 37 weeks atleast, so that baby is born at term, she monitored my health almost everyday . She was available anytime and responded with lot of patience. Never suggested any extra medications, and suggested for change in diet if necessary instead of medicines.

I n my husband r very happy to get a good Gynecologist who recommends her patients for normal delivery. Now a days all doctors do C-section,but she always prefer normal delivery and motivates us for the same and keep preparing us mentally on the same. The Hospital nurses are well trained to treat patients with utmost care with complete professionalism.I would recommend Dr.Vinutha prashanth for every pregnant women for her dedication, professionalism,kind support throughout the process and now i am blessed to have baby boy with normal delivery.

In fact after water leakage my wife was not confident as she was feeling pain while doing internal checkups. In fact she told doctor to go for cesarean delivery when she was not able to bear the pain. But again Dr Vinutha was so tactfully handled the situation that my wife again regained her confidence back. Even after multiple requests also she told that the baby heartbeat is fine, mom bp is also fine so there would not be any problem in normal delivery. After 12 hours of pain my wife could deliver the baby through normal delivery only. I found that if there would have been any other doctor, it would not have possible to do normal delivery. ",

She was able to give me a complete overview of how my 9 months journey and milestones are going to be built. When I went back home that day I was happpy and convinced that I should go ahead with her. She treats her patients with utmost care, personal attention, always available on phone and messages for any emergency.  We are happy with her and welcomed our princess this week. ",

My wife underwent some courses given by Dr. Vinutha and it worked so well that she feels like she had a normal delivery. She is able to do all her work, jog, run and don't see any difficulties. \nDr. Vinutha is very humble, **** ************** moreover she listens to all of our queries and then provides her valuable inputs. Most of the problems goes without further medication. \nBeing in USA from past 4 years we end up paying huge money for the Doctor visits and without any proper results.\nWe are so thankful to Dr. Vinutha for making our lives better and giving healthy life to my wife. Thank you so much. ",

Since my first child was born via elective C section, she made me understand all risks and complications associated with the second delivery which was also going to be an elective C section. \n\nI was very pleased with her overall attitude and manner in which she appeased all my doubts. I highly recommend her and cannot thank her enough for taking care of me.",

Despite the high tension on the day of delivery, we felt at ease and confident in the knowledge that she could handle any situation that may arise. Dr. Vinutha's ability to discern when to be serious and when to inject humor made a significant impact on our experience. We are eternally grateful for her guidance and care from the beginning of the pregnancy until delivery.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, Dr. Vinutha was instrumental in explaining to us what was required and how to care for ourselves and our baby. She always prioritized the patient's well-being by recommending the best course of action rather than unnecessary medication or scans. During our visits, she demonstrated extraordinary patience in explaining every aspect of my pregnancy and provided us with the necessary reassurance. She was always available to support us and never pushed for a C-section, unlike some of the doctors in Bangalore. Dr. Vinutha even went above and beyond by checking up on her patients during her free time.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr. Vinutha's services to anyone in need of a competent and compassionate doctor.",

Previously I was visiting another doctor who suddenly suggested an immediate laparoscopic surgery for my condition and had caused a panic situation in my family.\nBut visiting Dr. Vinutha made us feel at ease after she explained my condition very clearly and assured us it is not a situation to fear. She was very humble, patiently listened to all our queries and answered them in a soothing tone. She patiently explained the pros and cons of getting the surgery done immediately and gave us time to decide. Meeting her just once released all the tension and filled us with positivity.\nWe decided to go ahead with the surgery. Dr. Vinutha helped me go through the whole procedure with ease. She addressed all my concerns patiently and timely even in between her busy schedule. Surgery went very smoothly and I am extremely grateful to Dr. Vinutha. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a\nI am lucky to have found such a wonderful gynaecologist and I whole heartedly recommend her. The clinic is very clean and at a great location. The receptionist is also a very sweet and welcoming person\ud83d\ude0a (very refreshing after experiencing rude receptionists in other clinics).",

We found divine women's healthcare clinic which is near to us and having good google reviews, so we thought to give it a try. Fortunately for us it turned out to be great decision as Dr Vinutha prashant madam was the most wonderful human being, we couldn't be more happier with the level of care received throughout the treatment. Many times we used to trouble her out of the scheduled timings with our doubts and concerns but she has always responded with utmost care and patience like a friend Or a family member. Clinic is amazing and maintained very well. Sofa seating arrangements is awesome so that Patients can comfortably sit and wait for their tern. I would like to recommend this clinic and Doctor for all my family and friends without any second thought. Finally, Thank you so much madam for your dedication towards patients care.",

Just because of her we received our greatest joy of our life...our little Angel. During pregnancy my wife was diagnosed with gestational diabetes even then also Dr.Vinutha Madam made us kept calm and advised to consult Dr.Dwarakanth and we did as she said. The whole pregnancy she made us sure for taking care of everything- sugar under control, exercise, very restricted diet, everyday walk etc. For my wife's health Dr.Vinutha Madam was more conscious than my wife. But following her every statement only led us to deliver our life's best happiness.\nAlso she never asks to do unwanted tests, scans or have any unnecessary medicines. Neither she calls to meet unnecessarily. \nAt last I only want to say that - Thanks \ud83d\ude4f a lot Dr.Vinutha Madam. Thank you is just the least word I can say",

After realizing my loss of parents due to COVID, she stood by me for the mental and moral support from day-1 till the time of delivery. Her kind treatment and motivational speech helped me to take care of my fetus health properly. My intention for normal delivery was well noted by the Doctor though in later stages I was willing for C-section. Yes, I had normal delivery without any complications and all the tribute goes to the Doctor for her hard work and determination. Hats-off to her patience & energy levels, she was always there at the hospital to attend me when I went with pain. I was delighted that my actual name was Vinutha and literally Dr. Vinutha did my delivery :-), what a coincidence! Initially I hadn't knew Dr. Vinutha history but only to realize she was so skilled to handle many normal deliveries. I thank Dr. Vinutha from the bottom of my heart for showering bundles of love, care and support to the joy of the life coming normally - my baby!!",

From our first visit she made us feel completely comfortable with her. Extremely friendly and easily approachable with just WhatsApp messages.\n\nOn the day of delivery visited cloud nine hospital for NST as per Dr.Vinutha suggestion as I was having few contractions previous day. After seeing the report she was not satisfied and asked us to get NST with IV. She was in constant touch with duty nurse to get updates. Within few minutes she came to hospital as she felt heart beat was not good.\n\nShe suspected that baby could have passed meconium and explained us about breaking water to check. Unfortunately baby had passed meconium and heart rate was dipping drastically. She took a right call for emergency C section and within 20 minutes we were blessed with baby boy.\n\nWe are so grateful and thankful to Dr.Vinutha. A gem of a person who is so caring and understanding. \n\nThanks for being there with us!!!\n",

They were actually not consulting Dr.Vinutha from the start.\nThey are from nearby village in Tumkur. When my cousins wife suffered amniotic fluid loss in her 33 week of pregnancy due to intermittent medical conditions, it was an emergency when he called me. \nI forwarded the report to Dr. Vinutha and she suggested immediate medical support required and asked to rush the patient to Bangalore. It was around 9.30PM on 16th Mar 2020 and they came to Bangalore by around 1 AM next date. Dr. Vinutha was there right away and gave all required medical support and she advised delivery the same morning as the baby looked tired. We went with her suggestion and I am happy to tell you today both baby and mother are doing good.\nThis is a success story only because our Doctor's timely advise, clarity in thinking and the support she extended when most required.\nI admire her courage to accept the challenge when many others had a second thought, as there was no historical data available at that time as they were not her patient.\nDr. Vinutha Prashanth, you are a wonderful by heart, service oriented, down to earth, friendly *** **** *********** **** ************* ****** who can make common people understand medical situations and advise to take decisions with lot of clarity.\nThank you very much!!

When I approached Dr. Vinutha @29 weeks , by that time my second baby was not alive in the womb which we were not aware and because of it my BP levels were abnormal. She conveyed the message to me as a family member and asked to admit in the Hospital to monitor and save me as well as my baby. She was checking my health situation on an hourly basis with the staff. She was such a wonderful doctor who has taken care of the patient issue as her own issue.  She extended my delivery to 34 weeks with continuous monitoring of Dopplers and blood tests. At last In 33 week 4 days, they did delivery to me. Initially first baby has some respiratory problems with low weight 1280 grs. She has admitted in NICU for a month. OVUM NICU staff and Doctors did a good job in speedy recovery of my baby. By the time of discharge, my baby was 2000 grs and very happy to see my baby at home playing with her parents & near and dear.\nToday am having one baby that is purely because of Dr. Vinutha. She did a tremendous job which is countless. We are always thankful to her for the support of pre and post delivery. She is such an amazing doctor with lots and lots of patience. \nWe really love you and miss you..Thanks much for your support.",

Unfortunately my baby was a breach baby and normal delivery was out of option.\n\nWe booked a date for c section delivery and she was kind enough to make herself free for it. Delivery experience and after care was also very good. \n\nPost my delivery I started having postpartum anxiety and mild depression. In our regular checkup she was kind enough to councell us and to take help if needed. \n\nThanks to her, with in couple of weeks I was able to get out of my anxiety and depression. \n\nDefinitely recommend her. \n",

She suggested immediate delivery on the same day. I was shocked and crying. She consoled me and explained the risks if we have waited further. We opted for lcls and our bundle of joy was with us all healthy in the evening \u263a\ufe0f\n\nShe is always available over WhatsApp and answers all the queries and in emergencies you can call and talk to her.

Dr. Vinutha is highly professional, easily approachable(shared her contact number to reach in case of any doubts/emergency), and very caring with her patients. She listens to the patient's concerns and explains the treatment/process in simple terms. No unnecessary medicines and supplements are recommended.  In case of any complication in pregnancy she will explain the issue and the treatment required in detail. We are very happy to get treated by Dr. Vinutha, and strongly recommend her.P.S \u2013 We were blessed with a baby boy on 3rd Sept-2021 at  Cloud9 Kanakapura branch, both baby and mother are healthy. Entire process from hospitalization to discharge went smoothly. Thanks Dr. Vinutha and Cloud9 staff for taking care of both Mother and Baby.",
