Once pregnancy got confirmed, for all my prenatal checkups, I continued there. She fills a lot of confidence in patient, and is excellent. Minimal but best suppliments were given. Diet was adviced to make pregnancy smooth. It is hard to find such doctors.

Initially I did not feel the doctor much friendly but later when I got covid, and was scared, in this situation as well she adviced some vitamins and said, be confident, and that words were so promising and she filled that strength to fight covid, being a friend. 

She suggested prenatal yoga, which also played a major role in my pregnancy.
