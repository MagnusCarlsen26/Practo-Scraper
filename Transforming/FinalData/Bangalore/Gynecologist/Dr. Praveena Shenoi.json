When I visited for the first time back in March, the doctor had advised me to get these tests done and walk in without prior appointment as is the norm. I even called before visiting to ensure I didn't need an appointment and they confirmed the same. After I reached, I was told by the receptionist that I would need to pay for the visit since I didn't go back with the reports within a week's time since my first consultation. Now this was totally new for me as I wasn't informed of any such policy at the time of my first visit. After 45 minutes of waiting and speaking with multiple people, including the OP in charge, Ms./Dr. Tulika, I was told I would need to pay even though it was a miss on the hospital's side to apprise me of this policy. Totally disgruntled and frustrated I had no other option but to pay since I didn't want to spend time any further.A couple of fellow patients also expressed their irritation with the staff and the way they handled \"customers\" (I was shocked to hear the staff there addressing us as customers/clients). Their grim and stern faces added up to my misery. They weren't one bit apologetic about their blunder for which they made me go through all of this.\nHad it not been for Dr. Shenoy, I would have never ever visited cloud nine again. I would not recommended anyone to visit this branch ever just because of the staff.",

No matter if its a normal delivery or major c section surgery, recovery is super quick under her supervision. Her caring touch, neat stitches, fabulous guidance has made my post surgical experience so smooth which I never thought of. In my case normal delivery was not favorable but C section delivery is no longer seems to be scary any more in her presence !!! Great doctor indeed !!!",

She is busy so understandably you have to wait to meet her but just her voice and smile fills you up with tremendous confidence. She is there to answer all your questions. However, if you don't have any then you will see her only for a few minutes eventually. So I recommend you write all your questions before you meet her. My pregnancy was handled with utmost care by her and she was there throughout giving me confidence. She is a very pro-normal delivery doctor and even when there were some tense moments during the labor, she kept her calm and tried her best for a normal delivery. I recommend Dr. Praveena to every aspiring mother. All the best! :)",

I was really disappointed with that. What is the point of taking an appointment if you have to wait for 1.5 hour. These kind of silly mistakes spoil the brand name of the hospital.

Also because she was my sister-in-law's doctor as well and she handled her pregnancy very nicely. So in spite of long waiting hours,difficulty in getting an appointment and that she isn't easily available (over phone, only email) I still went ahead to consult her for my pregnancy. \nFirst trimester was ok. In one of my blood reports of  2nd trimester my RBC count was touching the borderline . On highlighting this to her assistant doctors, she dismissed it stating that it was normal. For her assistant doctor everything's ok and Dr Shenoi hardly noticed it as she spends only few secs per patient. So I didn't bother at that point of time as I thought it was ok. \nBut it was not because this triggered in my 3rd trimester. On having severe body itching Dr Shenoi advised for a test and when the test report was not ok. she advised me to consult endocrinologist and refer her name. however I couldnt get through the endocrinologist as he was busy for next two days. I referred another endocrinologist  wherein I  was diagnosed with HELLP Syndrome with ICP. during this time my health was deteriorating and due to an emergency I was admitted to Apollo. When the docs there mentioned that my condition was critical and will have to go for an emergency c section . There could be a possibility of platelet transfusion as well. I contacted cloudnine emergency section.I couldn't get through Dr Shenoi. Somehow I get the contact number of Dr Shenoi and i msg her the whole situation and ask her for her advice. Only response \"All the best\". Post delivery at Apollo I sent emails to her with reports and my condition. No response. No follow up. \n\nIs that what doctors are for? To leave your patient when she needed you.\nNot expected. Hence please beware when consulting her. \nAlso Cloudnine is not a multi speciality clinic. You have to consult different doctors should some complication arise. Also its not well equipped to handle emergencies. Baby will be fine but god forbid any complication arise for mother she is transferred to nearby hospital. \nSo my sincere request to all please consult Dr Shenoi at your own risk.",

I had already taken methotrexate injection at cloudnine bellandur under shefali tyagi. So dr praveena also suggested that the injection would work and there was no need for a second injection and i kept monitoring my hcg levels. Then my fallopian tube ruptured one day and we rushed to hospital. First they gave me pain killer injection and kept saying that after injection chances are less for tube to rupture. After repeated complaint of severe pain they gave another pain killer injection ***** *** ***** ***** Then my bp fell down n when the staff started worrying dr praveena came. By then 2 hours had passed. They took me for a tvs scan to confirm tube has ruptured. For scan too i had to wait. Everything disappointing till then. After scan i was prepared for the surgery. Surgery was done. Next day my blood tests were done and my haemoglobin had fell down to 4 and i was not given any blood transfusion but iron shots the following day. Due to lack of blood i found it difficult to breathe and breathlessness was there for following 2-3 weeks and headaches for couple of months which went away as my health improved. After surgery i kept complaining of pain on left side (my left tube was removed) and kept asking doctor the reasons during my successive visits but she kept saying it will be fine and there was nothing to worry. I read a lot about adhesions and asked her if it was that and she ruled it out straight away in a mocking way saying adhesion gives unbearable pain. Unsatisfied, ** **** ** ** ****** **** ** ****** ****** ********** *** *** ***** *** ***** By then 3 or 3.5 months had passed. I got a scan may be after 4 months post my surgery at cloudnine bellandur ** ******* ****** *** he told that i had a polyp and signs of adenomyosis. He did two tvs scans during two time points of my period cycle to confirm it. Then i went with this report to dr praveena and she said she didnt believe his reports and asked me get the scan from dr shruti in her cloudnine branch. Before that she asked me to take hsg test. I did that and went to her. She told me to start planning as my right tube was fine. I told her that i still have pain n she told that there is nothing to worry. When i pressed more she told to get a scan from dr shruti n did that the same day. In the scan dr said there was no polyp n no adenomyosis n the pain could be because of adhesions but it cant be seen in scans. Then i showed my report to dr praveena and she told she had cases where ** ******* **** same things which were wrong and so she doesnt trust his scan reports. ** ** ******* ** *** **** **** *** **** **** ** **** **** ** ********** ** **** ** * ********* ******* Anyways, so when i asked again that why i have pain she told it could be small adhesions but not to worry as when i get pregnant and my muscles will stretch, they will go away. I lived my last 5 months or more in so much stress ******* ** ******** ***** ****** **** *** **** *** *** ** ********* *** **** ***** **** ******* ** ** ******* *******i consulted 3-4 more doctors after that based on her comment and the scan reports. Money and time was lost but more than that our peace of mind was lost. Dr praveena hardly gave couple of minutes every visit and we have never got satisfactory answers to our questions. * ******* ** **** *** *** ******* ** *** ***** *** *** ******* ** ******* **** ***** Now i have mild pain all the time which gets painful at times that i get tears in my eyes. Very disappointed.",

When I visited for the first time back in March, the doctor had advised me to get these tests done and walk in without prior appointment as is the norm. I even called before visiting to ensure I didn't need an appointment and they confirmed the same. After I reached, I was told by the receptionist that I would need to pay for the visit since I didn't go back with the reports within a week's time since my first consultation. Now this was totally new for me as I wasn't informed of any such policy at the time of my first visit. After 45 minutes of waiting and speaking with multiple people, including the OP in charge, Ms./Dr. Tulika, I was told I would need to pay even though it was a miss on the hospital's side to apprise me of this policy. Totally disgruntled and frustrated I had no other option but to pay since I didn't want to spend time any further.A couple of fellow patients also expressed their irritation with the staff and the way they handled \"customers\" (I was shocked to hear the staff there addressing us as customers/clients). Their grim and stern faces added up to my misery. They weren't one bit apologetic about their blunder for which they made me go through all of this.\nHad it not been for Dr. Shenoy, I would have never ever visited cloud nine again. I would not recommended anyone to visit this branch ever just because of the staff.",

She is busy so understandably you have to wait to meet her but just her voice and smile fills you up with tremendous confidence. She is there to answer all your questions. However, if you don't have any then you will see her only for a few minutes eventually. So I recommend you write all your questions before you meet her. My pregnancy was handled with utmost care by her and she was there throughout giving me confidence. She is a very pro-normal delivery doctor and even when there were some tense moments during the labor, she kept her calm and tried her best for a normal delivery. I recommend Dr. Praveena to every aspiring mother. All the best! :)",

Also because she was my sister-in-law's doctor as well and she handled her pregnancy very nicely. So in spite of long waiting hours,difficulty in getting an appointment and that she isn't easily available (over phone, only email) I still went ahead to consult her for my pregnancy. \nFirst trimester was ok. In one of my blood reports of  2nd trimester my RBC count was touching the borderline . On highlighting this to her assistant doctors, she dismissed it stating that it was normal. For her assistant doctor everything's ok and Dr Shenoi hardly noticed it as she spends only few secs per patient. So I didn't bother at that point of time as I thought it was ok. \nBut it was not because this triggered in my 3rd trimester. On having severe body itching Dr Shenoi advised for a test and when the test report was not ok. she advised me to consult endocrinologist and refer her name. however I couldnt get through the endocrinologist as he was busy for next two days. I referred another endocrinologist  wherein I  was diagnosed with HELLP Syndrome with ICP. during this time my health was deteriorating and due to an emergency I was admitted to Apollo. When the docs there mentioned that my condition was critical and will have to go for an emergency c section . There could be a possibility of platelet transfusion as well. I contacted cloudnine emergency section.I couldn't get through Dr Shenoi. Somehow I get the contact number of Dr Shenoi and i msg her the whole situation and ask her for her advice. Only response \"All the best\". Post delivery at Apollo I sent emails to her with reports and my condition. No response. No follow up. \n\nIs that what doctors are for? To leave your patient when she needed you.\nNot expected. Hence please beware when consulting her. \nAlso Cloudnine is not a multi speciality clinic. You have to consult different doctors should some complication arise. Also its not well equipped to handle emergencies. Baby will be fine but god forbid any complication arise for mother she is transferred to nearby hospital. \nSo my sincere request to all please consult Dr Shenoi at your own risk.",

I had already taken methotrexate injection at cloudnine bellandur under shefali tyagi. So dr praveena also suggested that the injection would work and there was no need for a second injection and i kept monitoring my hcg levels. Then my fallopian tube ruptured one day and we rushed to hospital. First they gave me pain killer injection and kept saying that after injection chances are less for tube to rupture. After repeated complaint of severe pain they gave another pain killer injection ***** *** ***** ***** Then my bp fell down n when the staff started worrying dr praveena came. By then 2 hours had passed. They took me for a tvs scan to confirm tube has ruptured. For scan too i had to wait. Everything disappointing till then. After scan i was prepared for the surgery. Surgery was done. Next day my blood tests were done and my haemoglobin had fell down to 4 and i was not given any blood transfusion but iron shots the following day. Due to lack of blood i found it difficult to breathe and breathlessness was there for following 2-3 weeks and headaches for couple of months which went away as my health improved. After surgery i kept complaining of pain on left side (my left tube was removed) and kept asking doctor the reasons during my successive visits but she kept saying it will be fine and there was nothing to worry. I read a lot about adhesions and asked her if it was that and she ruled it out straight away in a mocking way saying adhesion gives unbearable pain. Unsatisfied, ** **** ** ** ****** **** ** ****** ****** ********** *** *** ***** *** ***** By then 3 or 3.5 months had passed. I got a scan may be after 4 months post my surgery at cloudnine bellandur ** ******* ****** *** he told that i had a polyp and signs of adenomyosis. He did two tvs scans during two time points of my period cycle to confirm it. Then i went with this report to dr praveena and she said she didnt believe his reports and asked me get the scan from dr shruti in her cloudnine branch. Before that she asked me to take hsg test. I did that and went to her. She told me to start planning as my right tube was fine. I told her that i still have pain n she told that there is nothing to worry. When i pressed more she told to get a scan from dr shruti n did that the same day. In the scan dr said there was no polyp n no adenomyosis n the pain could be because of adhesions but it cant be seen in scans. Then i showed my report to dr praveena and she told she had cases where ** ******* **** same things which were wrong and so she doesnt trust his scan reports. ** ** ******* ** *** **** **** *** **** **** ** **** **** ** ********** ** **** ** * ********* ******* Anyways, so when i asked again that why i have pain she told it could be small adhesions but not to worry as when i get pregnant and my muscles will stretch, they will go away. I lived my last 5 months or more in so much stress ******* ** ******** ***** ****** **** *** **** *** *** ** ********* *** **** ***** **** ******* ** ** ******* *******i consulted 3-4 more doctors after that based on her comment and the scan reports. Money and time was lost but more than that our peace of mind was lost. Dr praveena hardly gave couple of minutes every visit and we have never got satisfactory answers to our questions. * ******* ** **** *** *** ******* ** *** ***** *** *** ******* ** ******* **** ***** Now i have mild pain all the time which gets painful at times that i get tears in my eyes.

I felt that I as really in safe hands. \n\nEven her  associate Dr. Triveni was also good. Her interaction with me was a tension reliever.\nSeeing doctor's smiling face only took away my half the tension. Now I know nothing will happen to me and I will be cured soon.  \nI would say lucky to have such genuine doctor after consulting many money making professionals.\nThanks a lot doctor.

When I started going to her, I wondered if she'll have enough time and attention for me given she is the busiest gynae in the town and shuttles through three rooms in one go. But I was pleasantly surprised. She gives you complete attention, is warm and friendly and prompt over emails as well. Another thing I liked is that she covers all her bases and informs well in advance of all the tests to be done (Liver tests for ICP + Hb in my case) and precautions to be taken (crowded places during viral season in Blr).\nShe gave me her best effort for a normal delivery and when it failed, didn't let me feel miserable to end up with a csec. Post delivery also, she came in everyday for checkup. She has a very rich experience and it shows!\n\nWould absolutely recommend her for pregnant moms!",

Thank you cloudnine for having such good and excellent doctors. Not only me my few friends who totally left hope of having kids are now have healthy kids and are very happy.

Doctor barely spent 2 min after me waiting for her in pain for 2 hours. It was even sad to see such a senior  doctor not even having a personal scanner in her cabin to at least scan if  it's ectopic pregnancy or some other pain. Turns out  I had to wait again in the queue to get the scan done, another hour. My pain was increasing and Dr. Shailaja who did scan said all okay and u come back after 3 days for next scan. I asked doctor if it is some cyst as i have PCOD, she spoke to nurse and told her that she forgot please add PCOD also in my report. Before my telling PCOD she was saying all okay report everything healthy, * ****** ** *** **** ******* **** ** ***** ******* * **** *** Nurses did not even allow me to show that report back to doctor and take her advice as the doctor was busy and my appointment was over. I am still suffering and praying no complication happens. I'll be visiting another gynae tomorrow My whole day wasted and not even a clue of why this pain.\nI wish I had stayed at home resting than going to Cloudnine. ",

It is because of her my wife had a normal delivery. By seeing her smiling face she used to for got each and every difficulty of pregnancy. Though she does not give much time, but what ever time she spent is a quality time.

Throughout my entire 9 months journey she had been a wonderful Doc. The team at Cloudnine too was great and Dr. Shenoi always prefers Normal delivery. I delivered a healthy baby normally inspite of long labour period because of Dr. Shenoi and also the team at Cloudnine.\nWould highly recommend Dr. Shenoi.

Before welcoming our baby, I went through multiple pregnancy loss including ectopic with one fallopian tube removed through surgery. However Dr Praveena still gave me hope to try naturally after looking at my reports. And with God's Grace I conceived naturally and Dr Praveena made sure that my pregnancy journey should go smooth by suggesting frequent scans and tests. People often complain that they don't get enough time from doctor because of her busy schedule. But Dr Praveena spent enough time with me to clear my doubts during my entire pregnancy. Really thanks doctor for taking care of me and my baby very well. ",

She shrugged her shoulders when I asked if over the counter ovulation strips could give me clarity on whether I was fertile to try for a child. In short, she took my concerns lightly and didn\u2019t give them due attention. I was pretty disappointed about that.",
