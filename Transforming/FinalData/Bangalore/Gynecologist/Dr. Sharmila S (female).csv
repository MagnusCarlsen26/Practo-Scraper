,,0,0,NO,"I was made to wait for 45 minutes because even though Dr Sharmila has appointments from 10am available on practo, she apparently only turns up at 11.30am. Once my appointment actually began, *** ***** *** **** ******* ********** didn't explain anything and instead directly prescribed a battery of tests and sent me to the billing area where I was told this would cost twelve thousand rupees. She seems to have zero empathy *** ** **** ********** ** ******* *** *** *** ******* ******** ****** ******* ********** *********Definitely do NOT go to this person if you are interested in family planning. The staff was very nice and did not seem too surprised when I mentioned she did this and didn't explain anything. The receptionist was very kind and told me I could skip a particular expensive test if I want, but I was no longer comfortable in using this doctor or Vydehi's services.

,"Urinary Tract Infection (Uti),",0,0,NO,"We had a disappointing experience with Dr.Sharmila. 

*** *** ****** **** ************* ****** * she clearly stated a schedule to perform tests on the first consult and then directly contradicted herself and denied making those statements when we visited her the second time. 

She seemed to be in a hurry and rushed ahead barely giving time to answer our questions and provide the medical history. 

 She eventually ran tests and diagnosed the issue. However the experience left a bad taste.",2023-04-10 17:50:59,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
