She guided me through every step of the pregnancy journey with patience and clarity, always taking the time to address my concerns and ensure I felt informed and reassured.

Thanks to Dr. Sneha's expertise and dedication, I welcomed my baby girl into the world under the best possible care. I cannot thank her enough for her kindness, professionalism, and the exceptional level of care she provided throughout this life-changing experience.

I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sneha to any expectant mother seeking a compassionate, skilled, and supportive gynecologist. She truly made a positive difference in my pregnancy journey, and I am forever grateful.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"From the first visit itself, Dr. Sneha had made my husband and me so comfortable and reassured that we were certain of being in the right hands. We were so pleasantly amazed at her immense patience for answering the long list of questions and doubts that we had. In each and every visit, she made sure of prodding us to ask all our doubts and share all our concerns. She repeatedly asked ""what else"" to ensure that we left her cabin only after asking evey single thing that might have been bothering us. She is so approachable that we never hesitated from asking even the silliest of questions. She also shared her email ID and her number towards the end to ensure that we can reach out in case of anything urgent or just to clarify any doubts or seek reassurance. She was always so prompt in responding to our queries that it further helped reduce our anxiety, knowing that help is just a text away.
During pregnancy, when things seem so uncertain and confusing, having someone to provide reassurance, explain things and lend a sympathetic ear is something for which we can't be grateful enough. 
From the first day, Dr. Sneha made sure that my husband was treated as an equal partner in this journey, and was not made to feel excluded at all. This is something that is still not a norm sadly. We were really relieved at her approach as it was really important for us to share the experience and be there for each other every step of the way.
Dr. Sneha never made us feel like we were just another patient, she would always remember our names and would greet us like a friend. 
My pregnancy was a high risk case and there were a lot of complications. Dr. Sneha deftly handled all the issues and was really quick in identifying and addressing the concerns. Because of her quick decision making we were able to avoid adverse effects of a complication that I developed in the 37th week. 
She also tried her best to ensure that we could go for a vaginal delivery, only when it was no longer feasible because of the complications, she counselled us to consider a planned c-section. 
The actual day of the delivery, the experience was beyond anything I could have imagined. Dr. Sneha allowed my husband to be there in the OT during the c-section, holding my hands as we welcomed our baby in this world. I can't express in words how much that helped soothe my nerves and helped me overcome all the fear and anxiety that I had before the surgery. The experience was further enhanced as our baby was brought into the world to the tunes of soulful songs that ma'am was playing during the operation. I can't believe that even I was singing along during the operation, ma'am was so happy when she noticed me singing! I still get amazed that I was having a discussion with her regarding the movie that a particular song belonged to during my c-section! 
Post the procedure as well, ma'am took a lot of care to ensure that I was completely recovered and there wasn't any discomfort or potential issue remaining unidentified and unaddressed. She was also there during the discharge to participate in the cake cutting ceremony. She truly helped us feel cared for and this didn't feel like just a professional relationship but a cherished relationship built on care, trust and respect. Thanks a lot ma'am for making our journey so beautiful despite the multiple bumps that we encountered on the way.",2024-02-14 07:19:58,False,True,Sweta,Thank u dear sweta and Ayush 🥰,2024-02-15T01:18:01+0000,Dr. Sneha Rajiv
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We flew in from the  UK to give birth to our child in India at week 32 of our pregnancy.  Before we came to Bengaluru, we did a few checks on doctors and decided that we were to meet her. We have to say that it was probably the best decision we have ever made to choose Dr. Sneha.
At our first appointment, she waited for us close to 20 minutes without any fuss as we were running late and within the first 15 minutes of talking to her we knew that she was going to be our doctor on our pregnancy journey hereafter.  We did visit another doctor, who we absolutely did not like, after we spoke to Dr. Sneha but we very well knew who we were going for in our journey. 
Dr. Sneha patiently listened to everything that we had to say for 45 minutes at our first appointment before talking about her perspective. That is very commendable. 
On all our subsequent appointments, we spoke about the journey and everything else very casually, shared a bit of humour and fun to take the stress away of the impending birth for us. It was quite refreshing for both the doctor and for ourselves. 
There was no unnecessary advice, pointless checks or tests and her dedication to do a normal delivery is something I have not heard about much in India. She recommended a handful of very useful things for us and explained clearly why she was doing so. We saw the results of that rather quickly. 
Not only was she our doctor, she is also very dear to us because of her charisma, friendliness  and impeccable character. She ensured that both of us were not stressed in any way throughout our checkups and also on the day of birth. 
When my partner went into active labour suddenly, she was constantly reachable and ensured that everything proceeded on her instructions despite her not immediately being there. 
To give a snippet of our day of labour, Dr. Sneha met with an accident while on the way to to the hospital to deal with us. Despite that, she got herself to the labour room with a properly bruised shin, limping because she wanted to somehow deliver our child. She continuously worked for 6 hours straight and did everything she could possibly do to give birth to our son vaginally. 
She had already accepted our birth plan in a very reasonable manner and was very open about me being beside my partner during the birth. She was very clear, early on, on what was possible and what wasn't during the procedure. 
No other doctor, I'm sure, would have done that because the baby had pooped quite a bit of meconium (Grade III) and it was meant to be a classic case of an emergency C section. 
Dr. Sneha was very clear that as long as the fetal heart rate did not drop, she was going to do everything in her power to do a natural birth. There were various complications like the cord being wrapped around the baby's head and the baby being much bigger than expected. 
Not only she took care of the birth  so well but also my partner after strenuous labour. She checked on us frequently during our stay in the hospital and ensured that we felt comfortable and were clear on the recovery stages. 
I cannot recommend her enough for any pregnancy or birth related consultations irrespective of where you are located in Bengaluru. 
Thank you Dr. Sneha for helping us with the mental strength to get through what was a very tough birth for my partner.

When we started planning for baby, from the beginning throughout the journey Dr. Sneha was always there for us, she was patient and considerate to listen all our concerns, queries, and insecurities.
When conceived there were complications from the beginning which were proactively identified, and proper treatments were prescribed, timely follow-up and precautions from her were of great help.
She always made us feel comfortable which inspired confidence and peace of mind. We could reach her any time in case of emergency or concerning events, for a first-time expecting couple even small things become big worries, but she was always there for us.
In first trimester we faced complexity of sub-chronic bleeding, but it was well treated by her guidance and medication. 
It was not an easy journey, but we knew that our baby was in good hands.
We had normal delivery, but it wasn’t an easy one. Our Baby weight was on higher side with umbilical cord looped tightly around the neck. The go to solution was cesarean, but Dr. Sneha inspired positivity and gave us an option of normal delivery. 
This was a big decision for us, the trust and confidence on Dr. Sneha made us opt for the normal delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"When a women is pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant, the first thought comes in mind  is about which doctor to consult . the moment I was pregnant, I started searching ‘good gynaecologist’ around me . I was recommended Dr Sneha by a closed source. The moment we met her , I did not have second thought. After each consultation I felt so relaxed , so positive and confident about my journey . She was very practical at the same time caring . She didn’t prescribe any unnecessary medicines , tests but did everything what was required . I blindly trusted her and followed all her instructions ( ofcourse with lot of silly questions which she tolerated 😀) . The best part about her is in each and every visit , she would give us full attention, all her time without hurry or rushing which helped us to create patient - doctor friendly bond ,which is very very crucial , specially in pregnancy. I have seen many of my friends changing doctors at various stages of their pregnancy , but for me our biggest blessing was having her as a doctor right from the beginning till the delivery . My whole journey was so smooth without any complications which I owe it to her . It’s important to have relaxed mind during pregnancy and since she was only a call / wats app away , I never had to bother about anything related to pregnancy. And the day of my delivery, she recommended what is best for me and my baby and took timely decision which helped both of us to be safe and healthy 😊.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I was in my 4th month when we planned to move and choose a doctor in Bangalore. I was a little bit worried about choosing the right Ob-gyn for continuing my check ups here. I saw the reviews in Practo for Dr. Sneha mam and I thought I should go to her to continue with my pregnancy checkups further. My initial visit with mam was very convincing and she cleared all my doubts well and also asked me to contact her in case of any issues. Mam also encouraged me to be healthy and exercise well. She suggested a prenatal yoga instructor (Ambica Mam) and encouraged me to do yoga for pains arising during pregnancy. It also helped me to sleep well without any pain issues until my due date. Any pregnancy issue was constantly monitored by mam. Finally, the day arrived and on June 13th early morning I joined the ER. Mam personally called me and gave me confidence when pains were induced. When the time for delivery was coming close, mam was there and I strongly remember mam telling me "" Don't give up on pains, I can see the head of the baby"". She was a mentor during the last stages of my delivery constantly encouraging me to give pains. When the time has arrived she confidently handled the situation and took out my baby. Despite having a AF leakage, I was able to deliver normally with a healthy baby and all the credit goes to Sneha mam. She was always on time, very concerning about her patients and very attentive when we have any issues. Specially, during this covid situation, she minimized our physical visits to hospitals and did online consultation to reduce the spread of covid to us. She also share us very important information on Covid and Pre-post pregnancy. I strongly recommend her because she has a strong determination to give the best to her patients and take care of them 24*7. Love you mam.. :)

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I feel lucky to have found Dr Sneha during the first trimester of my Pregnancy. 
The time she devotes to her patients and clarifies all of their doubts is rare in today's time. After our first consultation only - My husband and I felt completely at ease and got sure that we wanted to be consult Dr Sneha only during the entire pregnancy period.

Another thing which I would like to highlight is that Dr Sneha has an innate ability to put a patient at ease and she never tries to overcomplicate things and will only prescribe medicines which are necessary and also will never force you to go for unnecessary tests. During my pregnancy I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and before meeting Dr Sneha, I was consulting at a ""Big reputed hospital"" wherein they were only trying to sell panic. After consulting Dr Sneha, I was able to manage my diabetes only through diet and walk and never had to take any pill. I can only say - being pregnant and delivering a child is probably the hardest task a woman undertakes and at this critical time to find a doctor who is skilled as well as humane can surely make the journey smooth and easy.

We have received a very good treatment from Dr. Sneha from the day one when I undergone my ectopic surgery in 2019. She is very compassionate and approachable for anyone those who needs any kinds of gynecological issues/requirements.

Dr. Sneha's magical presence uplifted we both of us to a stage with lots of positive emotions in our difficult times. She has boosted our confidence and that taken me to the labour room for a normal delivery.
I have seen Dr. Sneha's interactions in the form of good physical treatments, clear advise, quick instructions, timely orders and which enable us to create a good rapport with her.
