She is very friendly and explains everything whether she is introducing any medicine or why any new test needed to be done or any further step needed to be taken.\n\nMy wife is an IT professional. So, my wife was looking for normal vaginal delivery as other types of delivery like caesarean or forceps delivery is coming with different types of complications. I and my wife were not confident about the normal delivery, but Dr. Shashikala has given confidence to us that if no other complication happen during the later time of pregnancy like baby position or health issues then my wife can go for normal delivery.\n\nThe day my wife admitted in hospital she was asking for caesarean delivery, but Dr. Shashikala encouraged my wife and though normal delivery is painful, but my wife was able to do it.\nI really appreciate Dr. Shashikala\u2019s knowledge and experience regarding this matter.\n\nNow I and my wife has been blessed by a baby boy where all people Dr. Shashikala, other doctors and nurse\u2019s effort, involvement and blessings associated.\n\nThank you, Dr. Shashikala, for helping my wife to enter to Motherhood and me to Fatherhood phase of life. I highly and happily recommend Dr. Shashikala to the would-be parents for their parenthood journey.\n\n",

They were so clueless about everything) didn't let me in . She herself went inside and as expected, was unable to explain the name of the medicine. When I went to the medical shop, one of the medical store couldn't understand the name of the same medicine. Fortunately, one guy at another MedPlus store knew about that medicine and gave it to me. The name of the medicine was completely different to what was told to me by her assistants. \nShe might me good with pregnancy cases, but I didn't find her appropriate for my case. \nAlso, the google maps location is wrongly mentioned. When I called at clinic to inquire about its actual location, as expected they were unable to explain me. ",

Though she didn't know much abt my case, she treated me well and delivered a healthy baby thru NVD. Then i consulted her regularly for my 2nd pregnancy. On the day of delivery,I rushed into hospital arnd 7 AM with strong contractions and 7 cms dilated. She reached hospital in a very short notice (30 mins to be precise). She also notified the reception and duty doctor to send me directly to labour room and check immediately. As there was no much time, I didn't go thru preps/admission process. I delivered a healthy baby within 45 mins while my husband was still carrying out the admission formalities.\nHer timely response and dedication towards work, made the entire process so smooth. If it wasn't her, I would have been in trouble! Many thanks to her!",

But I'm glad I did and  consulted Dr. Shashikala Hande. She ensured I had a Normal delivery since everything was normal for me. Even though I was screaming in labor pain to get C section done but Dictor assured and convinced me to bear the pain and she will not do C section  unnecessarily and made me deliver my Handsome little Baby Boy through normal vaginal delivery.

She used to solve concerns and provide required advices efficiently.\n\nDr. Shashikala Hande provided her guidance throughout my entire pregnancy phase till delivery. There was some complications which she handled very well and always used to approach positively. I was not enough confident about normal delivery due to intense labour pain. But she helped me in Normal Vaginal Delivery which was a dream come true for me. Her treatment and guidance has given me the happiness of Motherhood. Her support made my entire pregnancy journey smooth and successful. Me and my husband are blessed with baby boy and now my baby is just 1 month old and doing well.

She is very friendly and explains everything whether she is introducing any medicine or why any new test needed to be done or any further step needed to be taken.\n\nMy wife is an IT professional. So, my wife was looking for normal vaginal delivery as other types of delivery like caesarean or forceps delivery is coming with different types of complications. I and my wife were not confident about the normal delivery, but Dr. Shashikala has given confidence to us that if no other complication happen during the later time of pregnancy like baby position or health issues then my wife can go for normal delivery.\n\nThe day my wife admitted in hospital she was asking for caesarean delivery, but Dr. Shashikala encouraged my wife and though normal delivery is painful, but my wife was able to do it.\nI really appreciate Dr. Shashikala\u2019s knowledge and experience regarding this matter.\n\nNow I and my wife has been blessed by a baby boy where all people Dr. Shashikala, other doctors and nurse\u2019s effort, involvement and blessings associated.\n\nThank you, Dr. Shashikala, for helping my wife to enter to Motherhood and me to Fatherhood phase of life. I highly and happily recommend Dr. Shashikala to the would-be parents for their parenthood journey.\n\n",

They were so clueless about everything) didn't let me in . She herself went inside and as expected, was unable to explain the name of the medicine. When I went to the medical shop, one of the medical store couldn't understand the name of the same medicine. Fortunately, one guy at another MedPlus store knew about that medicine and gave it to me. The name of the medicine was completely different to what was told to me by her assistants. \nShe might me good with pregnancy cases, but I didn't find her appropriate for my case. \nAlso, the google maps location is wrongly mentioned.

                "review_text": "I've consulted Dr. Shashikala for both my pregnancies. Visited her for the 1st time, just a week before my 1st delivery. 2nd visit was on the day of delivery. Though she didn't know much abt my case, she treated me well and delivered a healthy baby thru NVD. Then i consulted her regularly for my 2nd pregnancy. On the day of delivery,I rushed into hospital arnd 7 AM with strong contractions and 7 cms dilated. She reached hospital in a very short notice (30 mins to be precise). She also notified the reception and duty doctor to send me directly to labour room and check immediately. As there was no much time, I didn't go thru preps/admission process. I delivered a healthy baby within 45 mins while my husband was still carrying out the admission formalities.\nHer timely response and dedication towards work, made the entire process so smooth. If it wasn't her, I would have been in trouble! Many thanks to her!",

Even though I was screaming in labor pain to get C section done but Dictor assured and convinced me to bear the pain and she will not do C section  unnecessarily and made me deliver my Handsome little Baby Boy through normal vaginal delivery.
