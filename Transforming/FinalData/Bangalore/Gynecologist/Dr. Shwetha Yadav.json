Finally we met Dr. Shweta Yadav and our search process ended\n\nShe is so cool, calm and composed and she possess both patience and perseverance, She listens to each and every single query, After our initial meet with her i was so relaxed as she made us so comfortable and and guided our journey like a shining light. She made our journey of 9 months look like a cake walk, She has a very well grip on her subject and she makes sure every thing is aligned well through reports, First and Second trimesters she helped us with every minute details which would be good for mother and baby as this being the building block and foundation be it Fruits, Vegetables & Additional Medicines for Iron, Calcium\u2026\n\nShe is available 24/7 whenever we needed she was there for us during the journey, Last trimester she takes additional care and depending on our situation she said we can go for Normal Delivery. We followed her advice religiously. As per her Advice on 25th July, 2021 We were blessed with a Baby Boy - Normal Delivery. The Scene is still fresh in my eyes when she put on her doctor\u2019s green court and made her progress to the ward in midnight and just in another few mins\u2026She delivered our little bundle of joy\u2026\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f\n\nThrough My Entire Journey, I have noticed the entire workforce at ovum are so cooperative and they maintain the hospital so clean and in accordance. The Hospital Management is so Good that i did not face any issue during these unprecedented times - Covid 19\u2026All thanks to the every charming and Smiling hospital management staffs\n\nFor my journey i had constant Support from PRO - Mr Rajesh & Mrs Fathima Sister they guided me helped me in booking and assisting me with packages, even Mr Anil from Admissions and Billing team helped me with the Cashless Insurance Experience\u2026\n\nA big shout out to all the nursing staffs and peer doctors, duty doctors and all the lab people and all the hospital management people, i really had a very pleasant and seamless delivery experience\nTHANK YOU ALL\u2026\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d ",

Finally we met Dr. Shweta Yadav and our search process ended\n\nShe is so cool, calm and composed and she possess both patience and perseverance, She listens to each and every single query, After our initial meet with her i was so relaxed as she made us so comfortable and and guided our journey like a shining light. She made our journey of 9 months look like a cake walk, She has a very well grip on her subject and she makes sure every thing is aligned well through reports, First and Second trimesters she helped us with every minute details which would be good for mother and baby as this being the building block and foundation be it Fruits, Vegetables & Additional Medicines for Iron, Calcium\u2026\n\nShe is available 24/7 whenever we needed she was there for us during the journey, Last trimester she takes additional care and depending on our situation she said we can go for Normal Delivery. We followed her advice religiously. As per her Advice on 25th July, 2021 We were blessed with a Baby Boy - Normal Delivery. The Scene is still fresh in my eyes when she put on her doctor\u2019s green court and made her progress to the ward in midnight and just in another few mins\u2026She delivered our little bundle of joy\u2026\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f\n\nThrough My Entire Journey, I have noticed the entire workforce at ovum are so cooperative and they maintain the hospital so clean and in accordance. The Hospital Management is so Good that i did not face any issue during these unprecedented times - Covid 19\u2026All thanks to the every charming and Smiling hospital management staffs\n\nFor my journey i had constant Support from PRO - Mr Rajesh & Mrs Fathima Sister they guided me helped me in booking and assisting me with packages, even Mr Anil from Admissions and Billing team helped me with the Cashless Insurance Experience\u2026\n\nA big shout out to all the nursing staffs and peer doctors, duty doctors and all the lab people and all the hospital management people, i really had a very pleasant and seamless delivery experience\nTHANK YOU ALL\u2026\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d ",

Had not so pleasant experience at a different doctor a week ago when she tested positive for pregnancy & hence we decided to visit change the doctor. We narrowed down to Dr.Shwetha based on proximity to our place & more importantly based on the feedback in Practo. We absolutely concur with the positive feedback that others have given. \n\nShe took time in getting the complete history of first pregnancy, delivery, medical history & current medical condition. She patiently went through every specific aspect related to pregnancy & made notes...never gave us a feeling that she wanted to quickly get over & move on to the next patient...instead she encouraged us to speak out, provide details & ask questions...she asked us to continue the existing tablets until we finish them before switching on to her prescribed tablets...this was so pleasing to see that she did not undermine the good suggestions from the prior doctor or overrule them just for the sake of it...so unlike the current breed of commercial doctors - pardon me for saying that.\n\nWhile we will go back to Hyderabad for delivery as that's our hometown, we instantly made up the decision that she will be our doctor as long as we are here in Bangalore...we both strongly recommend her & would like to thank both Practo & it's users for leading us to her.",

This doctor was a blessing in disguise as I was little apprehensive about the normal delivery but the doctor talked us through and ensured that I safely delivered the baby. The doctor is thorough professional and always ready to guide you round the clock with a positive attitude. She had kept us informed about every stage during the pregnancy. My normal delivery recovery time was really quick. I would like to thank the Doctor and the whole team who helped me through the labour/delivery period. My husband and I are extremely satisfied with the support and guidance. I have already recommended couple of my friends to visit the Doctor, *** **** ******* ***********",
