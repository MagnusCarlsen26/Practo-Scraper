"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Labor and Delivery,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery,",0,0,YES,"We have been visiting Dr. Radha Rao from past 5 years, the services we received from her are excellent. I have been referring her to my friends and family personally, finally thought of sharing a review publicly.
My wife went through an early pregnancy event way back in 2018 that' when we met the doctor for the first time. She was very accurate in diagnosing the situation and responded very quickly during an emergency.
She has helped us through the pregnancy of our two kids until now.
Doctor supported and encouraged my wife to go for normal delivery both times and provided the confidence that once we reach the hospital she would make sure the best possible course of action would be taken from then on. For example, during both labours she was monitoring the situation through the night at a regular interval.
She is crystal clear in her communication and she has been very transparent in disclosing the details. Her diagnosis/assessment is spot on.

"Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Gynaecological Problem,",0,0,NO,"Nothing personal against the doctor. She is a good person and friendly. However the time she spends is too less, not much importance given to history and no possibility to consider alternate therapy before prescribing hormonal therapy etc.,

She did a wonderful job with ovarian cyst removal for my wife but then prescribed a hormonal injection which she said would help stop periods and help with menopause. She did not spend time explaining the side effects or possibly long term effects of this. I feel she should have done this and that would have helped us take an informed decision. My wife is now suffering many side effects of these two injections taken and the periods did not stop (restarted after few months), they have become more painful etc.,  We will never go back again there for any treatment.

It would have been better if she had spent more time explaining what these injections are for, would they really help, what are the possible side effects, is there really a benefit from these v/s some other methods or not doing anything etc., But now we cannot reverse what has been done, sadly.
