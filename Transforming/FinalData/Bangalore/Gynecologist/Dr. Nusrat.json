I already recommended her to my friends and relative and few of them have already started consulting with her. \nWe are very thankful that we have met Dr. Nusrath. \nThank you Dr. \nImran&Wajiha",

There was no other doubts thereafter. Her decisions are very clear and straight forward.  Unless there seems a complication that exists, she would never suggest for C-Section. She listened and answered our queries appropriately and made sure we are relaxed\nI had a normal delivery. Dr. Nusrat and her team made sure the delivery procedure happens very smoothly. \nMy special thanks and gratitude to Dr. Nusrat for treating us with love and care and making sure everything ends perfectly. \nI have already recommend few of my relatives and friends to consult Dr. Nusrat.\nThank you Dr for making my pregnancy a very beautiful journey.",
