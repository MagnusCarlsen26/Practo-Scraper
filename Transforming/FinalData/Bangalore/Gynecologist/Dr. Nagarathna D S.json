Then she told me to lose weight (which is fine), but when I asked her for advice on how to lose weight, she didn't even bother to look up from her phone and told me very impolitely and haughtily that there is no magic pill for weight loss (I'm well aware of this, but a doctor's opinion is valued). *** ****** ** ***** *** ******* this time I took my mother with me, as after the first visit I went home almost in tears because of the way I was treated. She wouldn't allow my mother to enter the consultation room, so my mother said she will wait outside the door. In response, the doctor asked me and my mother if we understand English. At this, I lost my temper and gave her a piece of my mind. She did look at my test results and give me a prescription, *** * ** **** ***** *** * *** ****** *** ****** **** Overall it was a very unpleasant experience *** ** ***** ** *** ****** **** *** ****** ***** * ** ***** ******** Visiting a hospital is stressful as it is, *** ******* **** *********** **** *** ******* * *** **** ******* **** ********** * **** doctor will put your mind at ease and comfort you in addition to treating your illness, and going by those standards, ********** ** *** * **** ******* Please avoid this doctor.

The first time it was just me, she didn't bother to ask me my name.. and when I was explaining to her what the problem was she rudely cut me off, to ask me questions about my age etc, without even looking at my face. Then she told me to lose weight (which is fine), but when I asked her for advice on how to lose weight, she didn't even bother to look up from her phone and told me very impolitely and haughtily that there is no magic pill for weight loss (I'm well aware of this, but a doctor's opinion is valued). *** ****** ** ***** *** ******* this time I took my mother with me, as after the first visit I went home almost in tears because of the way I was treated. She wouldn't allow my mother to enter the consultation room, so my mother said she will wait outside the door. In response, the doctor asked me and my mother if we understand English. At this, I lost my temper and gave her a piece of my mind. She did look at my test results and give me a prescription, *** * ** **** ***** *** * *** ****** *** ****** **** Overall it was a very unpleasant experience *** ** ***** ** *** ****** **** *** ****** ***** * ** ***** ******** Visiting a hospital is stressful as it is, *** ******* **** *********** **** *** ******* * *** **** ******* **** ********** * **** doctor will put your mind at ease and comfort you in addition to treating your illness, and going by those standards, ********** ** *** * **** ******* Please avoid this doctor.

After done with scan doctor said amniotic fluid level is low. She didn't even explained how to improve it. She straight away stated \"Pray GOD\" nothing we can say now. My wife started crying and she didn't even bother to say anything and went for rounds. Very dissatisfied. Later I had a second opinion and found that it can be improved by normal hydration.  ",
