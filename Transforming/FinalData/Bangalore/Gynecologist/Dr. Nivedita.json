She explained all the latest procedures and treatment plans and answered all our questions.\n-Her polite nature gave me good confidence with each visit\n-Her recommendations on few complications worked very effectively and during the early stages itself we developed complete trust on her.\n-She also provided us the support on phone whenever was required.\n-She is very professional and was available on time during the delivery and post delivery.\n\nThanks a lot to Dr. Nivedita!",

She gave my wife a lot of confidence and was very approachable be it on whatsapp or calls to help her clearing any doubts. And for the treatment she prefers less medication and only suggests the medicines which are required which was most satisfying. \nDuring one of the scans in 7th month end, we found out a problem in the blood flow from Placenta and from there on under her guidance we monitored it via regular scans and managed it for 1 month and had C section in the beginning of 9th month. During those tough times she also gave us a lot of confidence and always said Don\u2019t worry and still making us aware of all the possible scenarios and solutions. By gods grace and Doctors support we were blessed with a baby boy. I would highly recommend Dr Nivedita to everyone who needs guidance and humanly behaviour also along with the required treatment.",

Most importantly she is just a message away when it comes to availability.I always wanted a normal delivery and she helped me throughout my pregnancy to achieve the same. She always encouraged me to go for a normal delivery. On the 5th of this month, I delivered a healthy baby and the way she gave me strength and took care of me at the time delivery was like an angel being by my side in disguise.It would not be just for me to use the word recommend and so I am saying that you MUST visit/consult Dr.Nivedita before you go to any other doc.",

She explained all the latest procedures and treatment plans and answered all our questions.\n-Her polite nature gave me good confidence with each visit\n-Her recommendations on few complications worked very effectively and during the early stages itself we developed complete trust on her.\n-She also provided us the support on phone whenever was required.\n-She is very professional and was available on time during the delivery and post delivery.\n\nThanks a lot to Dr. Nivedita!",

She gave my wife a lot of confidence and was very approachable be it on whatsapp or calls to help her clearing any doubts. And for the treatment she prefers less medication and only suggests the medicines which are required which was most satisfying. \nDuring one of the scans in 7th month end, we found out a problem in the blood flow from Placenta and from there on under her guidance we monitored it via regular scans and managed it for 1 month and had C section in the beginning of 9th month. During those tough times she also gave us a lot of confidence and always said Don\u2019t worry and still making us aware of all the possible scenarios and solutions. By gods grace and Doctors support we were blessed with a baby boy. I would highly recommend Dr Nivedita to everyone who needs guidance and humanly behaviour also along with the required treatment.",

Most importantly she is just a message away when it comes to availability.I always wanted a normal delivery and she helped me throughout my pregnancy to achieve the same. She always encouraged me to go for a normal delivery. On the 5th of this month, I delivered a healthy baby and the way she gave me strength and took care of me at the time delivery was like an angel being by my side in disguise.It would not be just for me to use the word recommend and so I am saying that you MUST visit/consult Dr.Nivedita before you go to any other doc.",

Every time I visit her with a mind full of questions & worries but while leaving, there's always a smile & relief on my face. She makes the experience look so normal, unlike how people portray it & generally scare you. She expects us to visit her only if it is needed, she communicates over messages or a phone call. No uncessary tests or scans. I had healthy pregnancy and blessed with Baby through Normal delivery. All thanks to Dr. Nivedita for taking care of me throughout pregnancy and during delivery. Thanks a lot Dr!",
