I waited. After all the other patients had left , I sensed she wouldn't be coming for the day, I got to know doc won be able to make it to consult any1 else. \"Sorry for the inconvenience\" is such an easy sentence which ofcourse was the only thing they cud say! My point : if there is an emergency OT , Pls open up and tell the patients waiting that she won't be able to make it instead of making everyone wonder and wait.. ",

Anyway, she suggested treatment & i was fine. \n\nThe 2nd time i visited her was due to UTI. *** **** *** ****** ****** ******* *** ******** ********* ** **** she would just ask - \" So your periods came is it?

Thats it!! No explainations of what kind of infection, what is the severity, how it could have happened & what i need to do to avoaid it.

I waited. After all the other patients had left , I sensed she wouldn't be coming for the day, I got to know doc won be able to make it to consult any1 else. \"Sorry for the inconvenience\" is such an easy sentence which ofcourse was the only thing they cud say! My point : if there is an emergency OT , Pls open up and tell the patients waiting that she won't be able to make it instead of making everyone wonder and wait.. ",
