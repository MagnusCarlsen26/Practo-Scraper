She suggested for few checkups for pregnancy planning and explained all health issues to cure it naturally or  home remedies with less prescribed medicine. After few visits finally did pregnancy test and it was positive.  She delivered my baby Boy in August 2023. So thought to appreciate Dr Meeta Chauhan as an excellent and caring doctor.",

She has done my polyp surgery. After that surgery I was very convinced of continuing with her for my pregnancy journey, and I\u2019m very glad that we did. She is one of the best doctor I have ever met.\nDr. Meeta is exceptional in patient care and what I liked the most about her is her positivity and ability to put her patients at ease. She listened to all our questions and spent time for answering those and addressing all our concerns very patiently. \n\u00a0\nThrough my course of interaction with Dr. Meeta, I also felt that she possesses a unique quality of understanding that each patient is different and that she understood exactly what we needed. I was 38 when I conceived. I had a lot of complications in my pregnancy including hypertension, high blood sugar, low placenta position, low baby weight. But Dr. Meeta always kept me motivated and ensured that I don\u2019t worry about things when not needed. She told to concentrate on that part which we can control and not concentrate on those which we can\u2019t control. \u00a0She advised to take the entire journey of pregnancy and childbirth step by step which made it less overwhelming. She helped me to manage all my issues mainly through diet and lifestyle changes. She mainly focused on protein intake to increase baby\u2019s weight. I really liked that she would recommend and encourage to follow home remedies to rectify a problem rather than prescribing medications. She also suggested options such as meditation and reiki to keep my stress under check.\n\u00a0\nShe has not only been supportive and motivating during the entire period but also extremely understanding of all the apprehensions and questions that I had and helping me through it. She instilled all the needed confidence in us and at every stage took the best care possible with timely medications, counselling and advise. Every time, I visited her, the warm welcome and the positivity I got from her was the most important thing I needed.\n\u00a0\nDuring second trimester of my pregnancy we understood that we won\u2019t be able to complete 40 weeks of pregnancy due to mu complications. So she prepared me accordingly and from 26 weeks she gave medication to mature baby\u2019s lungs. Finally in 33+ weeks I have delivered baby girl via C section. Since the baby was premature and having LBW, she did all the arrangements to admit baby in the NICU under the care of Dr Ankur Rajavanshi after the delivery.\n\u00a0\nIt needs a kind heart and immense presence of mind to handle such challenges and my case was a clear indication of her dedication to her profession and her patients. Dr Meeta was a blessing for us. Thank you Dr. Meeta and Cloud nine Team for all your support and guidance and for making my Pregnancy and childbirth journey so memorable. I would strongly recommend Dr Meeta.",

Quick check with family and friends resulted in a few renowned names and my husband and I visited all of them to find out who we are the most comfortable with. I was already past my first trimester when I first visited Dr. Meeta and after meeting her I was very convinced of continuing with her for my pregnancy journey, and I\u2019m very glad that I did. \n\nDr. Meeta is exceptional in patient care and what I liked the most about her is her positivity and ability to put her patients at ease. I think this is very crucial for first time moms like me who over-analyze and google every medical term. :) She listened to all my questions and spent proper time answering them and addressing all my concerns very patiently. After each visit I used to come back calm and relaxed.\n\nThrough my course of interaction with Dr. Meeta, I also felt that she possesses a unique quality of understanding that each patient is different and that she understood exactly what I needed. She listened to my expectations, kept me grounded, and explained what I can and cannot control. I had some issues during pregnancy - anemia, high BP, high weight gain, low placenta position, lower baby\u2019s growth than expected in some scans, and sometimes the blood test reports were not normal. But Dr. Meeta always kept me motivated and ensured that I don\u2019t worry about things when not needed. We took the entire journey of pregnancy and childbirth step by step which made it less overwhelming. She helped manage all my issues mainly through diet and lifestyle changes. I really liked that she would recommend and encourage to follow home remedies to rectify a problem rather than prescribing medications. She also suggested options such as meditation and reiki to keep my stress under check. \n\nThroughout my pregnancy Dr. Meeta was very supportive of my decision of trying for a normal delivery. I was admitted during my 39th week as my labour pains began and during the entire delivery process Dr. Meeta and her team kept me comfortable and encouraged me in every possible way for a normal delivery before I had to opt for an emergency C-section. Her team took exceptional care of me while I was recovering in the hospital. The initial few days may seem very daunting for a C-section mom, but Dr. Meeta personally kept a check on me, advised normal diet and reassured me that things are all good which helped me face my recovery with positivity. \n\nDr. Meeta was everything I expected in my doctor. I\u2019m glad I chose her to be my gynaecologist during my pregnancy. I\u2019ve been consulting her even after my delivery, and can say with certainty that she\u2019s not a doctor you would go to only during your pregnancy, but someone you would want to consult during motherhood as well. \n\nThank you Dr. Meeta for all your support and guidance and for making my Pregnancy and childbirth journey so memorable.

Initially hospital allowed only mothers to meet the doctor due to COVID situation and I was worried, as either myself or any of our family members couldn't get a chance to directly speak to doctor. But when I got a chance to meet the doctor via video conference and 1st week of December 2020 , Dr Meeta cleared all our doubts patiently. \n\nMy wife cervix dilated by 3 CM in the 36th week itself but she didn't get the labor pain and Dr. Meeta Chawan suggested to wait for few more days to get the labor pain naturally for normal delivery and doctor initially doesn't prefer to go for C-Section or for starting the medication to initiate the  labor pain.  Family and friends circle was putting lots of pressure on us to get admitted for delivery, so we have visited the hospital again in the midnight. \nDuty doctor in the CloudNine examined my wife condition and consulted with Dr. Meeta Chawan via phone, then they asked us to take decision whether to get admitted to start the medication for labor pain or wait for few more days.  We were not able to make the decision and was in dilemma. Duty doctor explained us the situation and cleared all our doubts. So we decided to go home. Next day visited Dr. Meeta chawan again in the morning for OT. \nDr. Meeta gave lots of confidence on  why we can take risk by going home and wait for few more days for labor pain and she preferred to push for the deliver al-teast by  37th Week.  It was on 9th Dec and cervix dilated by 4 CM but still no labor pain and doctor suggested to get admitted by 12th Dec, even when my wife is not getting the labor pain.   \n\nAs doctor suggested we admitted my wife on 12th Dec morning and doctor started the medication to initiate the  labor pain. Finally it was normal delivery with assistance of vaccum extraction, as my wife was unable to push the baby and got exhausted in the final stage. Due to vaccum assisted birth, my child head had bulged a bit. Dr. Meeta and pediatrician, explained the condition and they gave confidence that it will go away and does not cause serious problems.   As they have mentioned, we see changes in baby head as the days goes on. \n \nBest part is Dr. Meeta Chawan and duty doctor allowed me to be in the labor ward at the time of delivery.  This is my life time experience  , because of this, I could realize the pain and value of mother. We are really feel so blessed with baby. So I would highly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawan. \n",

                "review_text": "We actually started looking for a good gynaecologist near Whitefield when we decided to have our second baby a year back. We had three options to choose Cloudnine, Manipal and Columbia Asia. Based on our previous experience with Cloudnine we decided to go with the hospital but not sure which doctor to choose. I left the choice to my wife and she decided Dr. Meeta Chawhan. Right from our first visit after our decision to have baby till the last visit after post pregnancy she had complete trust on the doctor in whatsoever complication might arise during the scan or blood test. She overcame all the little complications just because of the trust she had. How did she build that trust? Is that important? Yes, we wouldn\u2019t have had our baby if we didn\u2019t trust her. As simple as that. How did that trust grow? \nLet me explain here, \non our first visit she made us understand two things 1. Second pregnancy is not that easy as first because of the following reasons a) 5 years gap, b) extra weight gained than normal during those 5 year gap. She first made us to think, decide and act. We decided and went to her for the second visit after conception. She said the same thing and asked us to do few tests. Although, i\u2019m not very impressed after the second visit but my wife was very strong that she wanted to continue with this doctor for only  one reason \u201cshe cares for me\u201d. Her personal care towards the patients health during pregnancy and after the delivery is the at-most important. She made my wife feel confident and positive towards all the complications that arise during the pregnancy.  On the day of delivery we had lot more surprises than we expected, yes just minutes before taking her to LDR, the doctor noticed that the baby\u2019s head wasn\u2019t at the right position to come out.. Also, the baby couldn\u2019t resist inside as it passed motion and started drinking water, That\u2019s when we felt the real expertise and care to bring both the life\u2019s alive and she decided everything in a fraction of minutes.  She immediately rushed her to OT and took the baby out after little struggle as the baby have moved sideways. The baby didn\u2019t respond as soon it came out, the doctor took all our worries and made all the possibilities to make the baby cry and respond. It is just because of her care and expertise, I have my wife and daughter hail and healthy now. We are writing this review 5 months after delivery and 1.5 years after our first visit to strongly recommend the doctor as the situation we had to go through had been one in thousand cases or millions but it was a happy ending. \nTo be frank my wife had less complaints post second delivery (c-sec) than the first one (normal). We just  got words to say \u201cThank You\u201d to the doctor but pray a healthy and long life for her.\n\nRegards,\nSanthosh & Saranya",

The hospital's booking system schedules appointments every 10 minutes for new patients, yet the doctor must also attend to emergencies and some patients who require more time. Consequently, waiting times can be significantly prolonged during certain visits. Given the high volume of patients she attends to, the time allocated per patient is very limited. You may perceive that the doctor is in a rush to address your queries and may prefer you to move on swiftly to accommodate the next patient. It's crucial to reconsider this aspect, as accessibility to the doctor plays a vital role in your pregnancy journey. ***** *** **** ***** *********** ******* ** ********* *** *** ******** *** ********* **** ** ****** **** Even in our case, my wife raised a health concern during OPD visit, which she took lightly at the time. However, this resulted in further complications simply because Dr. Mita didn't spend enough time scrutinizing the problem as her schedule is overly packed.",

Her patience, expertise, and kindness made the whole experience a memorable and pleasant one.\n\nThe doctors approach to pregnancy and childbirth was refreshing and reassuring. I really appreciated the fact that she did not recommend any unnecessary medications, scans, or tests. She always prioritized my well-being and the well-being of my baby above anything else.\n\nHer advice on maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine was invaluable. It helped me to stay healthy throughout my pregnancy and to recover quickly after childbirth. I cannot thank Dr. Meeta enough for the guidance and support provided during this time.\n\nI would also like to thank Dr.Meeta for being so accommodating and understanding of my needs and preferences. She was always available to answer my questions and address my concerns.

She has done my polyp surgery. After that surgery I was very convinced of continuing with her for my pregnancy journey, and I\u2019m very glad that we did. She is one of the best doctor I have ever met.\nDr. Meeta is exceptional in patient care and what I liked the most about her is her positivity and ability to put her patients at ease. She listened to all our questions and spent time for answering those and addressing all our concerns very patiently. \n\u00a0\nThrough my course of interaction with Dr. Meeta, I also felt that she possesses a unique quality of understanding that each patient is different and that she understood exactly what we needed. I was 38 when I conceived. I had a lot of complications in my pregnancy including hypertension, high blood sugar, low placenta position, low baby weight. But Dr. Meeta always kept me motivated and ensured that I don\u2019t worry about things when not needed. She told to concentrate on that part which we can control and not concentrate on those which we can\u2019t control. \u00a0She advised to take the entire journey of pregnancy and childbirth step by step which made it less overwhelming. She helped me to manage all my issues mainly through diet and lifestyle changes. She mainly focused on protein intake to increase baby\u2019s weight. I really liked that she would recommend and encourage to follow home remedies to rectify a problem rather than prescribing medications. She also suggested options such as meditation and reiki to keep my stress under check.\n\u00a0\nShe has not only been supportive and motivating during the entire period but also extremely understanding of all the apprehensions and questions that I had and helping me through it. She instilled all the needed confidence in us and at every stage took the best care possible with timely medications, counselling and advise. Every time, I visited her, the warm welcome and the positivity I got from her was the most important thing I needed.\n\u00a0\nDuring second trimester of my pregnancy we understood that we won\u2019t be able to complete 40 weeks of pregnancy due to mu complications. So she prepared me accordingly and from 26 weeks she gave medication to mature baby\u2019s lungs. Finally in 33+ weeks I have delivered baby girl via C section. Since the baby was premature and having LBW, she did all the arrangements to admit baby in the NICU under the care of Dr Ankur Rajavanshi after the delivery.\n\u00a0\nIt needs a kind heart and immense presence of mind to handle such challenges and my case was a clear indication of her dedication to her profession and her patients. Dr Meeta was a blessing for us. Thank you Dr. Meeta and Cloud nine Team for all your support and guidance and for making my Pregnancy and childbirth journey so memorable. I would strongly recommend Dr Meeta.",

After each visit I used to come back calm and relaxed.\n\nThrough my course of interaction with Dr. Meeta, I also felt that she possesses a unique quality of understanding that each patient is different and that she understood exactly what I needed. She listened to my expectations, kept me grounded, and explained what I can and cannot control. I had some issues during pregnancy - anemia, high BP, high weight gain, low placenta position, lower baby\u2019s growth than expected in some scans, and sometimes the blood test reports were not normal. But Dr. Meeta always kept me motivated and ensured that I don\u2019t worry about things when not needed. We took the entire journey of pregnancy and childbirth step by step which made it less overwhelming. She helped manage all my issues mainly through diet and lifestyle changes. I really liked that she would recommend and encourage to follow home remedies to rectify a problem rather than prescribing medications. She also suggested options such as meditation and reiki to keep my stress under check. \n\nThroughout my pregnancy Dr. Meeta was very supportive of my decision of trying for a normal delivery. I was admitted during my 39th week as my labour pains began and during the entire delivery process Dr. Meeta and her team kept me comfortable and encouraged me in every possible way for a normal delivery before I had to opt for an emergency C-section. Her team took exceptional care of me while I was recovering in the hospital. The initial few days may seem very daunting for a C-section mom, but Dr. Meeta personally kept a check on me, advised normal diet and reassured me that things are all good which helped me face my recovery with positivity. \n\nDr. Meeta was everything I expected in my doctor. I\u2019m glad I chose her to be my gynaecologist during my pregnancy. I\u2019ve been consulting her even after my delivery, and can say with certainty that she\u2019s not a doctor you would go to only during your pregnancy, but someone you would want to consult during motherhood as well. \n\nThank you Dr. Meeta for all your support and guidance and for making my Pregnancy and childbirth journey so memorable.

Initially hospital allowed only mothers to meet the doctor due to COVID situation and I was worried, as either myself or any of our family members couldn't get a chance to directly speak to doctor. But when I got a chance to meet the doctor via video conference and 1st week of December 2020 , Dr Meeta cleared all our doubts patiently. \n\nMy wife cervix dilated by 3 CM in the 36th week itself but she didn't get the labor pain and Dr. Meeta Chawan suggested to wait for few more days to get the labor pain naturally for normal delivery and doctor initially doesn't prefer to go for C-Section or for starting the medication to initiate the  labor pain.  Family and friends circle was putting lots of pressure on us to get admitted for delivery, so we have visited the hospital again in the midnight. \nDuty doctor in the CloudNine examined my wife condition and consulted with Dr. Meeta Chawan via phone, then they asked us to take decision whether to get admitted to start the medication for labor pain or wait for few more days.  We were not able to make the decision and was in dilemma. Duty doctor explained us the situation and cleared all our doubts. So we decided to go home. Next day visited Dr. Meeta chawan again in the morning for OT. \nDr. Meeta gave lots of confidence on  why we can take risk by going home and wait for few more days for labor pain and she preferred to push for the deliver al-teast by  37th Week.  It was on 9th Dec and cervix dilated by 4 CM but still no labor pain and doctor suggested to get admitted by 12th Dec, even when my wife is not getting the labor pain.   \n\nAs doctor suggested we admitted my wife on 12th Dec morning and doctor started the medication to initiate the  labor pain. Finally it was normal delivery with assistance of vaccum extraction, as my wife was unable to push the baby and got exhausted in the final stage. Due to vaccum assisted birth, my child head had bulged a bit. Dr. Meeta and pediatrician, explained the condition and they gave confidence that it will go away and does not cause serious problems.   As they have mentioned, we see changes in baby head as the days goes on. \n \nBest part is Dr. Meeta Chawan and duty doctor allowed me to be in the labor ward at the time of delivery.  This is my life time experience  , because of this, I could realize the pain and value of mother. We are really feel so blessed with baby. So I would highly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawan. \n",

                "review_text": "We actually started looking for a good gynaecologist near Whitefield when we decided to have our second baby a year back. We had three options to choose Cloudnine, Manipal and Columbia Asia. Based on our previous experience with Cloudnine we decided to go with the hospital but not sure which doctor to choose. I left the choice to my wife and she decided Dr. Meeta Chawhan. Right from our first visit after our decision to have baby till the last visit after post pregnancy she had complete trust on the doctor in whatsoever complication might arise during the scan or blood test. She overcame all the little complications just because of the trust she had. How did she build that trust? Is that important? Yes, we wouldn\u2019t have had our baby if we didn\u2019t trust her. As simple as that. How did that trust grow? \nLet me explain here, \non our first visit she made us understand two things 1. Second pregnancy is not that easy as first because of the following reasons a) 5 years gap, b) extra weight gained than normal during those 5 year gap. She first made us to think, decide and act. We decided and went to her for the second visit after conception. She said the same thing and asked us to do few tests. Although, i\u2019m not very impressed after the second visit but my wife was very strong that she wanted to continue with this doctor for only  one reason \u201cshe cares for me\u201d. Her personal care towards the patients health during pregnancy and after the delivery is the at-most important. She made my wife feel confident and positive towards all the complications that arise during the pregnancy.  On the day of delivery we had lot more surprises than we expected, yes just minutes before taking her to LDR, the doctor noticed that the baby\u2019s head wasn\u2019t at the right position to come out.. Also, the baby couldn\u2019t resist inside as it passed motion and started drinking water, That\u2019s when we felt the real expertise and care to bring both the life\u2019s alive and she decided everything in a fraction of minutes.  She immediately rushed her to OT and took the baby out after little struggle as the baby have moved sideways. The baby didn\u2019t respond as soon it came out, the doctor took all our worries and made all the possibilities to make the baby cry and respond. It is just because of her care and expertise, I have my wife and daughter hail and healthy now. We are writing this review 5 months after delivery and 1.5 years after our first visit to strongly recommend the doctor as the situation we had to go through had been one in thousand cases or millions but it was a happy ending. \nTo be frank my wife had less complaints post second delivery (c-sec) than the first one (normal). We just  got words to say \u201cThank You\u201d to the doctor but pray a healthy and long life for her.\n\nRegards,\nSanthosh & Saranya",

The hospital's booking system schedules appointments every 10 minutes for new patients, yet the doctor must also attend to emergencies and some patients who require more time. Consequently, waiting times can be significantly prolonged during certain visits. Given the high volume of patients she attends to, the time allocated per patient is very limited. You may perceive that the doctor is in a rush to address your queries and may prefer you to move on swiftly to accommodate the next patient. It's crucial to reconsider this aspect, as accessibility to the doctor plays a vital role in your pregnancy journey. ***** *** **** ***** *********** ******* ** ********* *** *** ******** *** ********* **** ** ****** **** Even in our case, my wife raised a health concern during OPD visit, which she took lightly at the time. However, this resulted in further complications simply because Dr. Mita didn't spend enough time scrutinizing the problem as her schedule is overly packed.",

Her patience, expertise, and kindness made the whole experience a memorable and pleasant one.\n\nThe doctors approach to pregnancy and childbirth was refreshing and reassuring. I really appreciated the fact that she did not recommend any unnecessary medications, scans, or tests. She always prioritized my well-being and the well-being of my baby above anything else.\n\nHer advice on maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine was invaluable. It helped me to stay healthy throughout my pregnancy and to recover quickly after childbirth. I cannot thank Dr. Meeta enough for the guidance and support provided during this time.\n\nI would also like to thank Dr.Meeta for being so accommodating and understanding of my needs and preferences. She was always available to answer my questions and address my concerns. Her positive attitude and caring nature made me feel at ease and gave me the confidence to trust the doctor with the delivery of my child.\n\nOnce again, I am grateful for the exceptional care and expertise. Dr. Meeta had truly made a difference in my life and the life of my family. I will always remember her kindness, professionalism, and dedication to her patients.\n\nI really admire her hardwork and I have seen her in hospital even on Sunday's for IP rounds.\n\nDr. Meeta an amazing gynaecologist, and we are forever grateful to her. \n\nHighly recommended doctor !!!!!",

We were extremely cautious about the whole pregnancy and childbirth experience. Dr. Meeta made us feel comfortable every step of the way and made the whole experience enjoyable.\n\nWe were tested positive for the virus during the 5th month of pregnancy, and were really concerned since we had lost a close family member to the illness just the year before. But Dr. Meeta helped us get through it smoothly and with as little medication as possible. \n\nMost of her treatment is natural. She suggests lot of natural remedies to most of the complaints. She only prescribes medicines when it is absolutely necessary.\n\nShe keeps us informed on what to expect at every stage of the pregnancy. This helps us to be mentally and physically prepared. \n\nWe had opted for elective C section early on, but our case became an emergency unfortunately on the day of the surgery. The whole team at the ER at Cloudnine handled the situation professionally. There were a few other emergency cases that day and several planned C sections for that particular day. Dr. Meeta and her team kept visiting us in the IP room all this time, and kept advising us on the treatment options. \n\nEverything went smoothly and we are blessed with a baby girl.\n\nWe were overall more than satisfied with the experience at Cloudnine and with Dr. Meetha Chawhan. All her guidance and treatment made the whole experience very pleasant. We highly recommend Dr. Meeta for her experience and professionalism.",

As per the review, we planned to visit her and post the visit we decided to continue with her.\n\nShe had a very positive aura around her which helped me throughout my pregnancy. She always made me very comfortable with her calmness and made sure all of my queries are answered with logical reasoning.\n\nIt was advised to me to have all types of food and keep no restriction on the same. Ofcourse, the food was supposed to be home cooked; mainly protein rich since it helps in the growth of baby weight.\n\nI really liked how she has always been in favor of not taking unnecessary medicines and try to cure the issues by natural methods (i.e. home remedies).\n\nHer whole staff members has been very supportive during my delivery. Each and every person made sure that I get the bestest care not only physically but mentally too.\n\nIn the LDR, the whole experience (had a vaginal/normal delivery) just felt like a magical one just because of her and her team! \n\nHow can I ever forget those words right after my last push 'Congratulations, it's a girl!'.\n\nIt was a very emotional moment for my husband and me. She gave us a few minutes with the baby to relish that moment which I can never thank her enough for.\n\nThe best thing was having my husband by my side throughout the delivery which was again supported by her. Huge thanks to her for this.\n\nGenerally, there are many restrictions on consuming all types of food right after the delivery for 1.5 months irrespective of the type of delivery one has had (which I feel is a myth, now). But, she advised me to have anything and everything healthy. I was also asked to start with walking so that the healing process gets faster.\n\nAnd, it really did help me!\n\nI'm still in touch with her for my post-natal care.\n\nIf I had to do all over again; I would do just because of the confidence and trust I have on her.\n",

We got to know about Dr Meeta Chawhan through online search and the experience has been very good since day One.\nAs this was my first pregnancy, I always had so many doubts and concerns and she used to answer all of them with proper reasoning. As soon as you enter her room in OPD, she greets you with so much warmth and makes sure that all your queries are answered properly. She is very positive and polite. Another best thing which I like about her is that she never advices to take unnecessary medicines and always focus on home remedies which are very easy to follow. \nShe always made sure that my weight was under control and focused on diet and fitness. She suggest diet (Good protein intake) which makes sure that the baby\u2019s growth is good.  \nShe always motivated me for normal delivery however, due to certain medical conditions we had to opt for a planned C section which also went very smoothly all because of her. Due to some personal reasons, we decided to go for the surgery during wee hours and she agreed at once. I would also like to appreciate all her OT staff(Assistant Surgeon, Anesthesiologist and all others) present during the surgery. They were all very cooperative and made sure that I was very comfortable during the delivery.\nIn case of any doubts, she responds on text as well without any delay. \nMy pregnancy journey was a blessing all because of Dr. Meeta and we have been blessed with the best gift of our lives through her. Our baby boy is 5.5 months old now and her words during the delivery still echoes in my ears (\u201cAparna it\u2019s a boy\u201d).\nI am still in touch with her for post pregnancy check ups and I am always excited to meet her because of her positive attitude (specially to listen to that first energetic line \u201cHi Aparna, what\u2019s happening. Kya ho raha hai aaj.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to find Doctors like her these days. I would highly recommend her to all the couples who are looking for a good gynaec.\n",

My prenatal test results (NIPT) showed some complications, we were extremely tensed and were not ready to hear the bad news / loose the baby. She patiently listened to our concerns and queries, removed all misconceptions, explained the positives and negatives of taking up further tests and also explained the complication in a very clear manner plus what NIPT screen test meant. It gave us confidence to take up amniocentesis to further get clarity if the issue is really there or not. Luckily amnio results all came negative and we now have a healthy girl baby. \n\nShe encourages healthy eating and make up for the deficiency rather than prescribing a medicine. She monitors closely and then prescribes a medicine only if it\u2019s absolutely necessary. She also recommends certain home remedies along with eating healthy and medicine supplements (if needed). She always says \u201cMother should have a balanced diet, with good amount of protein, fruits and vegetables and lesser carbs and stay healthy. The one gaining weight has to be the baby!\u201d \n\nThank you, Doc! It was your medical advice and guidance that helped us (including my dead husband here as he was anxious too after the NIPT, Amnio etc etc) sail through the 9 months and give birth to a beautiful baby girl + recover well from c-section. Thanks for making our journey easier and a memorable one.\n\nWe would unquestionably recommend Dr. Meeta to all expecting mothers and the ones who are thinking of starting their family! \ud83d\ude0a\n",

It was Meeta Mam who came as a Angel like Doctor or a god in anonymous face,who from thestarting have guided me . Food medication exercise everything she cared like a mom and i followed her advice. Due to IUGR baby and low AFI ,High PI value in 33 weeks she suggested me to get Lungs maturity injection i got that . With her strict guidance and almighty blessing i prolonged my pregnancy to 37 weeks 4 days.But due to these complication she suggested me for C sec as it was a risky condition for baby as growth was already stopped.Like an angel she did my C section and i got my Baby girl safely on my hand without any complication or requirement of NICU though she weigh just 2kg . Her advice is v v imp to follow if you have risk in pregnancy.I strongly recommend meeta mam for everyone if you want to consult for a safe pregnancy.She was like God to me and my husband cause of whom i got my baby girl safely.Thank You Meeta Mam you are truely super doctor i have ever came through.The patience level,confidence and positiveness ,politeness and cheerful habit is something makes you unique in all.",

For spotting she suggested natural way of weight reduction rather than going for tests and scan. She suggested to observe for 2 months, if then also problem doesn\u2019t get resolved then I should go for scan. But with her advice on diet and exercise I reduced weight from 89 kgs to 67 kgs and the problem went away on its own. Doctor is very straight forward and practical, she will understand your situation well and suggest natural ways first rather than going for medicines or diagnostics. That really helps a lot in growing confidence in you and motivates you to work towards your problem yourself. Doctor also listens to your problem patiently and lets\nyou express well, she clarifies all your queries.\nSecond time I went to her for my pregnancy. Throughout this period I had some issues but she handled everything very nicely suggesting to drink lots of water, frequent food intake, exercises ,walking and working till the last day before delivery. That really helped me to stay confident and lead a very normal life throughout my pregnancy. I had a c section though doctor tried for normal delivery but my cervix didn\u2019t open 3 cm so I opted for it. But magically I started feeling fit and started to do all work after 6 weeks of my delivery. Her skill in operating is appreciable as the cut healed really fast. I would always suggest Dr Meeta for everyone women I know. Even many of my friends, colleagues and relatives are also consulting her and they are also very happy with her.",

The confidence she instills in mothers is truly impeccable. She listens and answers every query you have. She doesn't rush nor will scare you in case of any issues with pregnancy. \nOur 2nd pregnancy journey) Feb 22nd 2020 we shifted to pune from Bangalore, may 16th 2020 my wife was pregnancy positive, she was not happy as our son was still 1.7years old. My wife contacted Dr.Meetha whether to continue or abort but she strongly suggested her to continue since 1st baby was normal vaginal delivery.Till 3rd month my wife consulted Dr.Smitha in cloudnine Kalyaninagar. We took certificate to cross borders during critical covid situation, soon my wife finished her 3rd month scan we were in urge to consult back Dr.Meetha back in Bangalore.\nEven after traveling 900kms from Pune to Bangalore in car due to covid situation Dr.Meetha didn't insist for a scan she said everything will be alright no need of unnecessary scan.\nThis pregnancy wasn't smooth like the 1st one, my wife had severe tooth ache, scatic nerve pain, amniotic fluid level high, thrice severe false contractions, Trans position of the baby in 37th week. Inspite of all these Dr.Meetha suggested exercises, healthy food habits, good lifestyle *** ***** *********** *********** 38th week my wife had a normal vaginal delivery. Dr.Meetha never discussed about cesarean section in any of the consultation.\n*** ** *** ***** I am very thankful and grateful for keeping my wife safe and positive throughout the pregnancy. She is no less than an Angel who delivered my baby boy on 6th Jan 2019 and a baby girl on 2nd Feb 2021 and kept my wife and my angels safe. Truly blessed to find such a doctor. Above all, a better human being who has been compassionate, patience, positive vibes and supportive irrespective of what time you contact her.\nWe would highly recommend Dr.Meeta to any one who is carrying without a second thought in mind. We are truly honored madam. Thank you very much \ud83d\ude0a Definitely my wife misses you, she is always inspired by Dr.Abdul Kalam, Sadhguru, Anupama Vriksham and Dr.Meetha.",

Always optimistic and has positive attitude. It was our first pregnancy and from day one she was telling us to prepare for a normal delivery. We were bit worried whether we will be able to have a normal delivery but doctor was always sure. In the 9th month, our last visit to doctor, she told us to get admitted the next day and also told us that doctor can only assist but actual delivery mother has to do so be ready for long labour hours. If you can bare the pain we can deliver without C section. We attended lamaze session in 35th month. The physiotherapist, Dr Nitha, taught us different breathing techniques and different stages of labour and how to differentiate between false labour and actual labour pain. We admitted to the hospital by 10:30 pm in night and labour pain started by around 5 am in morning. Nurses were in constant touch with doctor, the whole night. By around 6am Dr Meeta visited us and by 6:45 we got our son delivered. It was a normal delivery. Me and my wife were literally on Cloud Nine. That day only we knew what is meant by Khushi ke Aashu. It was a feeling that no one explain in words.  One thing, I specifically want to mention is that the breathing exercises was really helpful. I accompany my wife in the labour room. She was in enormous pain and I was literally clueless and had no idea what to do. That time only one thing helped us, the different breathing techniques we learned during the lamaze session. We are very thankful to the Doctor for her guidance and patience through out our pregnancy. Thank you Doctor. ",

I was worried about selecting the best doctor for my pregnancy and did a lot of research before selecting my doctor and I must say that this was the best decision I took. She has not only been supportive and motivating during the entire period but also extremely understanding of all the apprehensions and questions that I had and helping me through it. This resulted in a smooth prenatal period. She also encouraged home remedies for most issues and this was great as it helped avoid unwanted medications. \n\nI also really appreciate the fact that I could have open communication with doctor on any matter and receive answers that helped manage my entire pregnancy. Also due to COVID situation, we could not travel to the hospital for all check ups and had to consult doctor via video call. I was initially worried how this would impact me but all my doubts were removed because even during video calls, Dr. Meeta enquired about my condition and provided solutions as needed. I felt there was no difference in the treatment provided on call compared to physical check up. \n\nShe is also highly responsive and responsible to/for her patients and this is a great quality. I had to rush to the hospital as my water broke and she was available and responding to the on call doctor and nurses at the hospital and guiding and checking up on the situation regularly. I really appreciate this as this put my worry to rest and I was more confident knowing that my doctor was available. Also, I must say that once doctor arrived and I saw her in the room, all my fears ended. This is the type of confidence that she builds in her patients. \n\nI look forward to continue having my check ups with doctor Meeta even after my delivery. Thank you doctor for making the entire journey a happy and wonderful one.",

We visited her in Cloudnine, 9 months back at the onset of our pregnancy journey . Say it our luck or any blessing we chose her as our doctor. While am no one to judge her expertise/knowledge , we were rest assured from day 1 with her advices. Short, Crisp yet the important ones she tactfully answered all our doubts , queries with much friendliness and calmness. I had a thyroid issue which when discussed with her at the beginning, got rightfully treated throughout and didnt had any major complications. The best part is the positive vibes that she radiates which reduces half of the problem for a patient . *** ******* ********* *********** ********* *** rightfully preempts future needs and gives medication accordingly. For example, I had taken vitamins, proteins  and iron medicines much ahead of time under her guidance and that truely reflected when the fetus was growing in size. But the part for which me and my family will be ever indebted to her would be the last crucial days before delivery. I was supposed to have a C-Section and just 2 days before  delivery I was diagnosed with Covid-19 positive. While the entire family was in a state of shock, she was super confident in getting the delivery done with no issues and right after 2 days I was blessed with a healthy baby boy and from day 1 Dr. Meeta ensured the baby stays with the mother and yet be protected from getting infected from the virus. After 1 month now to those situation when we reflect back we feel we could not have asked for a better doctor and  a better consultation in my pregnancy time. While am still continuing post delivery checkups with her , am looking for a long time association with her for any gyne related issues. *** ** *** **** *** *** **** ******** Thank you doctor Meeta for all your advices and help.

We are extremely happy and satisfied with all the expert guidance provided by the doctor.We started consultations with the doctor on a trial basis. Due to covid, only I was allowed inside the doctor\u2019s chamber. It was very new and scary to me to consult the doctor alone without my husband as this was my first pregnancy. My fears were soon to be quelled by doctor\u2019s smile. Her friendly demeanor relaxed me and made me comfortable. She answered all my questions calmly and provided me with her valuable guidance. I was very impressed with the first consultation and hence we decided to continue with her.Before every consultation, I and my husband would discuss and write down our questions. We were able to get answers to all our questions. The doctor always provided a thorough explanation after her diagnosis. The doctor provided guidance about my health, the baby\u2019s health, diet and exercises to aid the pregnancy as well as the baby and numerous other pregnancy related aspects. All the guidance, suggestions and the expert help provided by the doctor helped us in having a smooth and enjoyable pregnancy period.The doctor is straight to the point and hence it helped us to set the right expectations about the pregnancy period and the delivery. The doctor always pushed us and guided us towards a healthy pregnancy period and normal delivery. However, we were made aware of the last minute uncertainties regarding the normal delivery. I rushed to hospital during my 40th week of pregnancy due to the water break. The labor had not started yet. The doctor pushed for a normal delivery even then and tried various methods to induce labor. Since none of them worked, we were briefed about the risks and were suggested to undergo a caesarian section. The surgery was successful and we were blessed with a healthy baby.I recovered quickly from the surgery. It has been three months I had the delivery. I\u2019m still regularly consulting the doctor and following up with her guidance. It has been a very joyous, memorable and fruitful journey. ",

This was my first pregnancy and due to Corona situation I used to visit her alone as my husband had to wait outside. But I never felt any doubt on her and took any second opinion. She guided me very well through out my pregnancy till my delivery and I always trusted her. he used to be always very positive and to the point. I also felt that she is very friendly and makes comfortable to discuss any problem or answering any question which is very important during this whole journey. But she does not discuss things very prior like when I asked whether I can have a normal delivery or c section in my 7th month she said I still have lot of time for that and explained the possibilities for both. For sometime I thought may be she will prefer c section for me as she did not say anything definitely but I trusted her as she explained the things properly. And my thought was wrong. I understood this at the end, actually we can't predecide these things and she was absolutely right. At beginning there was no complicacy in my pregnancy, but in last scan it was found that amniotic fluid is less, baby weight is lilltle more 3.6 kgs and there is a cord in baby's neck. For these things she suggested an early induction in 39th week and she told that there might be a c section required for the complications but we will first try normal. At that point of time it was absolutely fine for me and I followed her suggestions. And she really guided and supported me till end and I had a normal delivery. I am grateful to be blessed with my little angel and we both are healthy. I really thank her for being with me in my whole journey.",

But she encouraged us to think positive and finally in Feb 2021 I delivered a baby boy under her treatment. She is the right combination of strictness and empathy that a doctor needs. Her knowledge combined with her calmness makes the patient trust her. She takes time to explain each topic the patient asks. We always used to ask a lot of questions, sometimes repeated ones but she explained them each time with same amount of zeal.  She is more focussed on keeping one healthy by changing diet, food habits and sitting postures. Always insisted on home cooked food and using regular spices from the kitchen.  I feel even after pregnancy I should follow her those tips as they will help me have a healthier life. So, this time too I faced short cervical length for which she gave right treatment and not rushed us to go towards cerclage (surgery which helps sometimes in short cervical length issue). We chose not to do that surgery. Every week she motivated me not to think about last pregnancy but to keep myself optimistic. Amid so much information from friends and family, she was the ultimate source of truth for me. Further in 27th week, I faced high sugar and cervical funnelling. She gave treatment to strengthen baby\u2019s lungs. In 37th week, we had to rush to hospital in late night emergency. She came at that time and successfully did C-section (which was call of the moment) to deliver my baby. She was randomly assigned to us when we took appointment in 2019 and I am thankful to God for this. ",

To have a normal delivery, provided there's no serious health risk to me or my baby\n2. To prevent the use of unnecessary medicines through out, and opt for their natural alternatives instead.\n\nLuckily, Doctor Meeta's priorities as well aligned with mine - she did precisely this, and much more. She is honest, blunt as well as forthright, and emphasizes eating right, exercising and maintaining a healthy physique.\n\nDr. Meeta is extremely experienced in the field and knowledgeable, and inspires confidence. When she entered the room during my labour, her manner and actions assured me that someone super-qualified was in the driver's seat - and everything was going to be alright. Her able guidance allowed me to have just 3 hours of active labour, which culminated in the delivery of a healthy baby boy.\n\nI remain forever grateful to Dr. Meeta for a cherished and memorable pregnancy, with absolutely no worries or concerns throughout. The duty doctors and staff of Cloudnine were immensely helpful and did a superb job as well during my admission. The facilities provided at Cloudnine Whitefield are definitely worth a mention with doctors visiting and guiding you every step of the way, all of which contributed to a really amazing pregnancy and delivery.",

You prefer to take in nutrition more through food rather than supplements. The doctor gives you the required supplements but doesn't go overboard with them.  She prefers you taking your nutrition through natural foods3. You are ok with not getting answers to questions that aren't important at that point of time, like asking questions around natural delivery or c section in the first month.. Rest assured, she will answer all your questions at the right time. And it makes sense to do that as she doesn't want the mother to take unnecessary stress about things which are not even to be thought about at that point of time*Long review*We were new to Bangalore and didn't know any gynecologist.  We checked for doctors on practo and came across Dr. Meeta's profile. We saw very high number of positive reviews and most of them mentioned that she is more inclined towards natural delivery and remedies. Thats what made us choose herDr. Meeta is an excellent doctor. Through the entire 9 months, there wasn't even one instance when we thought of taking a second opinion about her advice.  This was inspite of me having a family full of doctors who are surgeons and specialists. We could have easily cross verified what she told us to do, through our contacts. But the way she explains the reason for all the things she tells you to do or for the medicines she gives is simply outstanding.Through out the 9 months she was patient enough to answer all our questions. But as I said before she won't really answer questions that are not relevant at that time. She'll tell you \"there's still a lot of time for that. Don't think about it right now. We'll look at that when the time comes\". Which is the right thing to do in my opinion. An expecting Mother shouldn't be thinking about unnecessary things and adding stress to her pregnancyEven during the time of delivery Dr. Meeta was extremely professional and had the right balance of motivating the mother and pushing her to push harder for the baby to come out. I would certainly recommend her to anyone we meet. It's a definite 10/10. You would be extremely lucky to get your baby delivered through her.",

We were actually scared with the whole covid 19 pandemic and how things will turn out with delivery with all the covid 19 pandemic and associated risks.\n\nDr. Meeta has been very friendly through out the journey.  Aside the scans we seldomly visited the hospital for consultations. Most of the time the consultation was over the video/online unless physically check up was really needed. Dr. ensured that we are comfortable and explained everything in detail, answered all our queries. She helped us overcome the fear of delivering during covid. We never felt that consultation is being done over video. Consultation prescription and lab/scan reports were uploaded on the cloud nine mobile app.\nDr. Meeta advocated more on eating good than taking supplements or medicines. Our case was a little complicated with fibroid in uterus. We were nervous but she explained the complications, associated risks, possibilities and how to manage all this very nicely. With the dos / dons and diet suggested by Dr. we could control the fat and unnecessary body weight, pain due to fibroids and focused on babies health.\nConsidering the fibroid and twisted uterus, Dr. suggested to go for c section and managed the delivery smoothly. \nPost delivery we continue to consult and Dr is assisting with healing of uterus, recovery and fibroid treatment. \nIt has been a great experience. We highly recommend Dr. Meeta. \n",

                "review_text": "I was referred to Dr Meeta by Dr Manju Nair who treated me for repeated failure in pregnancy. Having been married for 9 long years somehow motherhood kept evading me and we reached a point when I had almost given up all hopes. Three times I conceived, but by 10th or 12th weeks I would miscarry. All doors and windows seemed shut. Finally we were referred to Dr Manju Nair at Cloud Nine Babs she ensured I succeeded getting pregnant with twins and referred us to Dr Meeta to take the pregnancy successfully forward. I still remember the first meeting with Dr Meeta. It was on 16 Mar 2020 with my first scan report. She literally surprised us with her overflowing energy and positivity. She instilled all the needed confidence in us and at every stage took the best care possible with her timely medications, counselling and advise. She was not just a doctor, but a great friend, philosopher and guide. My entire pregnancy was such a smooth journey under her care and practical approach to dealing with the entire 9 months. The last minute before delivery challenged our family like a demon in mask. As it was decided that we will need to go for C Section, everything was planned for 03 October 2020. As a protocol during this pandemic I had to get a covid test done and came the result as a boomerang. in spite of taking all precautions I tested positive and by 01st night my fluid levels went low and the babies had to be delivered on emergency. She took the best of all her efforts to ensure to get all arrangements done in cohesion with the hospital management and safely delivered my babies on 02nd October 2020 afternoon. She didn't stop with that but went and extra mile to get me moved to another hospital for covid management and entrusted my babies in the NICU under the care of Dr Ankur Rajavanshi as they were born late preterm at 36 weeks 5 days. It needs a kind heart and immense presence of mind to handle such challenges and my case is a clear indication of her dedication to her profession and her patients. I would strongly recommend Dr Meeta. She would reach me everyday to check on my health and also update me on how my babies were doingBeing under the care of Dr Meeta through your pregnancy means being safe. Thank you doctor... ",

This October we got blessed with a baby boy and its just because of Dr. Meeta. \nWe are blessed and grateful to have a doctor like her. Apart from her job, she really do care about her patients, she was always available in the difficult time of Covid also (Video as well as in person whenever required). She is a true example of a great doctor who has actually given her full life for the service of mankind.\nOur Story starts from 2018 when my wife was carrying and everything was fine till 6 Months of pregnancy but suddenly baby heartbeat stopped on its own and we both went in shock and rushed to Dr. Meeta. She calmly handled everything and not just did normal delivery but also did counselling of my wife in her hospital stay. Her positive attitude gave positiveness to us also.  she has really supported my family in those difficult times. She monitored my wife health 24*7 at C9 hospital, Attending doctor/nurses used to call Dr. Meeta every 4-5 hours at nights also (once at 2-3 AM and then at 6 AM). She always lifted the phone and guided the attending doctor. \nNow in 2020 my wife`s pregnancy journey started again with Dr. Meeta`s guidance and in these 9-10 months she is always available & answered all the questions of my wife and gave the best possible guidance and treatment. she always respond all the messages and calls in the difficult time of Covid also. With god`s grace we are blessed with a baby boy last month. I would strongly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawhan  :)",

She is always positive herself and encourage her patients also to be positive in any situation. For someone like me who hates to take medicines frequently unless essential, She suggests lot of natural and home remedies. I would like to call out my experiences with her for my Pregnancy and Delivery. In my 20th week, I was diagnosed with short cervix during the 2nd anomaly scan. This could lead to Pre-Term Delivery. She advised me complete and strict bed rest and assured me that we would and are doing everything possible in terms of medications and other precautions so that Pre-Term Delivery doesn't happen. She suggested me to take small steps and target - 1 week at a time and go through each week. Due to Covid-19 lockdown and my bed rest we tried to do video consultation frequently and as usual she always made me feel positive and relaxed. And at the same time, she also assured me that in extreme case scenarios, even if I deliver baby Pre-Term, we will take of him/her. Finally I delivered a healthy baby boy in my 37th week. Everyone had told me that you were in bed rest for four months, and it would definitely be a C-Section but Dr. Meeta proved them wrong as I had Normal delivery. More than medications and bed rest, I feel it was Dr. Meeta's positivity and talking, that helped me go through this tricky situation quite comfortably. Her Medical management, home & natural remedies that she suggested along with her positivity are boon for patients like me. Thank you Dr. Meeta.",

She has an amazing positive spark in her that calms new parents and brings a great sense of self belief. During this whole 9 months of consulting her, she never advised to take supplements or unnecessary medicines rather she was pushing for home made remedies. She was very clear from day 1 that we should attempt for a normal delivery. She was very strict with the diet and made us understood the need to excerise and maintain a high protein diet. This eventually helped me not to gain extra weight. On Couple of occasions, I had to get admit due to severe nausea/vomiting(2nd month), Dr was available to guide us through calls even during the wee hours of the day. This was during Covid and with no family members able to come from home town, we were terrified how things will go during labour and after delivery. Few sessions with Dr meeta in week 37-38 helped us in regaining our confidence. During the labour, I was unable to bear the pain and almost screamed at the staff to take me to OT and do a C section. It was Dr meeta who hold me like a guardian angel and gave the strength to bear the pain and go for a normal vaginal delivery. The way she conducted the whole delivery process was so beautiful.

After meeting Dr Meeta the first thing she told me to forget the past and look forward being positive. During each visit she made me more positive and confident. Else I was overly terrified and scared each days during the 1st trimester. I started consulting her during the 2nd trimester of this phase. She made my journey so enjoyable. Apart from being a good Obstetrician she is one of the best human being who always bring positivity in her patients. During the journey the way she suggested about the diet , exercises and other things to follow I just listened to her blindly. And I found each day improvement in my mind and body. At the later stage I was seeing myself a complete different me. I started believing I will get back my rainbow baby in my hand whom I lost. During each visit she narrates what shall be the next plan what tests etc needed to be done. I just followed her. Since I was scared I discussed with her if planned C section can be done. From starting of checking up with her she always told me to do normal delivery due to its multiple advantages. However since I was scared I discussed with her about planned C section on my 37 the week. After checking all reports n baby\u2019s growth she agreed on that. Now I am blessed with a baby girl. My baby is all fine and healthy and 17 days old. \nI consider her the Goddess of our life who has helped us to get a gift from the God up there and helped us to meet our rainbow baby angel. We shall be forever grateful on her.\n\nI would recommend all to meet her if you really want your pregnancy journey to make the most memorable one. Another quite important part during the pandemic time when the lockdown was going on, she was available either through video consultation or physically (alternate days). Since our angel baby born during lock down phase we were scared how things will happen etc. Again she relaxed me and made me confident that no matter what Govt takes decision I will get to meet my baby for sure. Such a memorable experience I had with her during my pregnancy phase.\n\nI thank her and the entire Cloudnine Whitefield staff (duty doctors, sisters, child soecialist doctors, administrative staff, securities, housekeeping staff) for taking care of me and my baby during the 3 days I stayed there post delivery.\n\n\n-\nRegards,\nSujata ( Dr Meeta Chowhan\u2019s patient)",

Started visiting her from day one and I still remember her first question - \"Pregnant ... What's your feeling ?? Happy or Sad ? .\" I said Sad, she asked why ??. I was like I am very scared by the delivery pain which we get during normal delivery (as my first one was normal delivery). \nShe smiled and said don't worry, 99% this time also it will be a normal delivery. I said I don't want that pain again and then she convinced me by giving options available for normal delivery like painless etc.\nI would say she is an amazing and talented doctor. From the starting she made sure I exercise or walk alot (since I was little overweight and this might increase the risk during pregnancy), eat healthy protein rich food, relax and most importantly enjoy the pregnancy.\nI followed her instructions and was quite impressed by her detailed knowledge on all the conditions and issues. She is quite friendly, so you can discuss any problem related to your pregnancy.\nI was waiting for the labour pain to kick in which didn't happen till my last week that is 40th week and I was quite tensed. Met her and spoke to her about it, she said don't worry. Our first motive should always be of \"a healthy baby\" and second for sure of normal delivery, but don't get tensed because of it. \nFinally, I got admitted and artificial labour was induced, post which also for a very long time the baby didn't come down (since the baby had the cord stuck around him). And the miracle happens, even after the situation, she waited for quite a long time and I delivered my baby via normal delivery.\nI would give all the credit to her since I never expected that even after in such situation I will be able to deliver normal.\nAnyway, thanks to doctor Dr. Meeta, will recommend her for her talent, ********** patience,friendliness, behaviour and most importantly her amazing work.",

We were actually consulting another very experienced doctor in another hospital in Whitefield.\n\nDuring the first trimester scan, it appeared that her cervix was small. As soon as the doctor looked at the report, she reacted sharply and asked my wife to undergo a binding procedure. We were psyched due to her reaction. However, we weren't convinced that she has to undergo a surgery so early in her pregnancy.\n\nThat's when we saw Dr. Meeta Chawhan through a friend's recommendation. In the first consultation itself she calmed us down - especially my wife. As soon as we stepped out of the consultation room, my wife told me that she got a very good vibe and would like to continue seeing Dr. Chawhan. We couldn't be happier that we did.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, Dr. Chawhan aptly demonstrated her expertise in handling such high risk patient, not just through diagnosis and treatment but also through her human touch. She knew exactly what our apprehensions were and how to alleviate them. She did so by slowly cutting down on the amount of medicine my wife was administered initially by the previous doctor. She also put only the much needed restriction on travel and food but eased that out too slowly. Also, through out the duration, we never had any feeling that she is recommending undue tests.\n\nMy wife's aunt is a very experienced (30+ Years) OB-Gyn practicing in Australia. She also kept vouching for Dr. Chawhan's treatment and case handling through my wife's pregnancy.\n\nMy wife normally delivered a healthy baby girl about a month back. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Meeta Chawhan. She made this day possible. We recommend her whole-heartedly.  We would continue to visit Cloudnine, Whitefield just for her.",

She answered all our queries to the point which gave us clarity throughout my pregnancy. Post pregnancy too, she made sure to bring my hypertension under control before discharge. Good Hygiene is always her priority which I liked very much. Dr. Meeta ensured my speedy recovery before discharge. She is so active and is also an inspiration for all women.

On top of it, it was twin pregnancy this time conceived using IVF and I\u2019m glad we met Dr Meeta this time. Her analysis was always detailed and she was always one step ahead of the situation. I received cervical stitch and was able to carry out pregnancy.\nFew of positives of Dr Meeta\n- She was never in hurry, and listened to all our concerns\n- She was always telling us the exact state but somehow she always managed to keep us calm even when it was difficult time for us\n- She is well experienced and knowledgeable in handling complex pregnancies and what follows after IVF conceptions.\n- She was always available. When I was about to go labor (preterm), Dr Meeta was out of country but she not only got everyone in hospital to carry out all the necessary steps including state of leak, lungs development injections, brain protection injections, providing antibiotics etc and she was in touch with us as well. I am always thankful to her for spending her vacation time on me and later when she arrived in bangalore, she wasted no time and did my c-section. I do not think she got any rest before reaching hospital. After kids were born, she was following in NICU as well even when she was not the consulting doctor\n\nAgain, i would highly recommend her",

My overall experience with doctor Meeta Chawhan was superb and excellent.\n\nDr Meeta M'am is very friendly in nature and very responsive too. She mostly advises on natural remedies rather than prescribing chemical/heavy medicine. Her diet plan really helped me a lot  throughout my pregnancy. Thank you so much to Dr Meeta for making my pregnancy look so normal and the 9 months just flew under your care.\n\nDoctor Meeta M'am is so responsible and even she will be available when you really need her for any assistance.Dr responds on your texts/WhatsApp/call if it's really important and urgent. I Would highly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawhan for anyone who want medications under gynecology and pregnancy/ obstetrics.",

Undoubtedly the best doctor in town and I am fortunate to consult her for my high risk pregnancy.She is best not only because of her knowledge and treatment style but because of her positivity. From day 1 you enter her room till I got released from the hospital with my baby it was only positivity from her. I had developed some issues during my third trimester but her treatment and early diagnosis was really helpful. If she finds something is not normal with your reports she will action immediately to cure on time rather than sitting on it.\nThe best thing with doctor meeta is she will not give you any unnecessary medicine and rather will suggest you natural food and some home remedies which if you will listen diligently it will be beneficial during and in long term after your delivery. \n\nEvery visit she will greet you with a smile, she makes sure to tell you every possible doubts or questions you might have for your upcoming days and never will be impatient if you have any further questions.\n\nTrust me I always felt she absorbed all my worries and when i use to leave the consultation room I had a very happy and empty mind.\n\nHighly recommended doctor without any second thoughts.\n\nThank you again for our little and healthy bundle of Joy.",

She suggested for scan and in the scan, a dermoid cyst was detected in my ovary. Doctor suggested laparoscopic surgery to get this removed before it grows big enough and ruptures causing complications down the line. Meeta mam explained the surgery procedure and assured me it's nothing to be worried about as incisions would be very small and hence recovery would be fast. She guided me through all prerequisites of the surgery. Overall it was very smooth process from the time of admission to day of discharge. Post surgery I recovered with minimum required medications. All things were taken into consideration so well throughout the procedure that I did not face any problems or side effects at all with any of the prescribed medications or the surgery procedure itself. I was feeling well enough to be discharged the next evening of the surgery. Post surgery, in one week itself i started feeling almost like before and in another week I was able to continue with my daily routine with of course some exceptions like not lifting heavy things etc. Overall the procedure went very well and even though as soon as I heard about having to go through surgery i was worried but Dr Meeta helped me understand about the advantage of laparoscopic surgery, which is small incisions and subsequently faster recovery time than normal surgery.

We had regular consultation sessions, ofcourse keeping all necessary precautions because of the ongoing pandemic crisis. She explained the baby's current and expected conditions during these sessions and I had a newly instlilled confidence because of them.

My weight gain during my pregnancy was only 3 kgs with a healthy baby. Thanks to Meeta ma'am for her guidance.  My delivery day and post delivery experience was also so good. She never recommends unnecessary medications rather suggests always a well balanced diet, I feel so blessed to meet Dr. Meeta.

I delivered in swastha hospital during my first pregnancy and i went there only during  my second pregnancy but the doctor scared me so much that I started feeling that i may not survive. My husband told me to change the doctor as i was very depressed. I searched for best high risk pregnancy expert and i got Dr Meeta\u2019s name. I went to her and she was so good and positive that i started feeling nothing will happen to me. She always supported me emotionally and gave lot of positive vibes. I lost 4 kg weight in my first few months as my first doctor kept me on a very strict diet as i had gestational diabetes but Dr Meeta allowed me to eat all healthy food in limit and I started enjoying my pregnancy. I was never stressed again. I had only ICP with my second pregnancy and I delivered safely in 37 weeks 1 day. My baby is healthy and safe. God sent Dr Meeta as an angel for me. ",

She is an extremely busy doctor and despite of that she never rushed during my consults and patiently responded to my endless questions with detail explanation. \n\nDuring my second pregnancy,  at the time of regular check up at week 37 ,  due to various reasons we had to go for an emergency operation and she organised everything for us at the hospital without us worrying about it overnight and instead , insisted on me focusing on myself and LO vs worrying about anything else. She took care of everything at the hospital.\nThe experience we had with Dr. Meeta has been extremely positive which helped build our blind trust on her. I have recommended her to lot of my friends and family members who also now share similar positive experience with her.\n\nI would strongly recommend her. \n\n",

It was Covid 19 lockdown started in bangalore in march 2020 and we were very scared to continue with our big multi speciality hospital due to possible infection fear. It was a big challenge to shift in between the pregnancy for a new hospital and doctor nearby. With our friends reference & suggestions we started consulting with Dr Meeta Chauhan in cloudnine whitefield. It was perfectly a right decision. She supported and guided us with confidance for all our pregnancy and health related concern. We didn't look back for multi speciality facilities further. Dr Meeta guided us for healthy diet plan over traditional eating habits for focused effect on health of child and self without gaining weight much. Her focus was to prepare the body for Normal delivery through simple excersise. \nShe monitored the health and growth continuously and waited till day of EDD without being in hurry. Finally on 15th Aug the baby was delivered in good health. 3 days after we were discharged safely to home. Now my baby is 20days old, all fine.\nI recommend to go for Dr Meeta Chauhan for pregnancy related concerns. \nThank you madam for your support during our pregnancy.",

Her positive outlook towards things is what helped us sail through this journey smoothly. Her focus on diet and exercise during pregnancy kept me from gaining a lot of weight, meanwhile keeping me and the baby healthy and in the best of shape. She believes not only in medicines but also in traditional home remedies that resolve a lot of general pregnancy issues. She attended to all our doubts and answered all questions with a smile and patience. I had an elective C-section on August 4th due to a previous CS. All my anxiety and fear in the OT disappeared when I saw her walk in and within minutes I had my son, one of the best moments of my life for which I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Meeta. The recovery too has been smooth, all thanks to her. Thank you for being the dedicated, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor that you are!  ",

In the hindsight, I can blindly say it was one of the best decision I have ever taken. Throughout pregnancy she explained small things in detail (like why do we need certain test or why certain medicine is required etc). She did emphasise on importance of having home food/healthy diet and maintaining sugar level (I had bit high) by diet, if possible so that I can avoid unnecessary medicines but prescribes if it becomes necessity. Best part is, every time I met her, she was smiling and happy to consult me which gives lots of positive vibe and confidence. Throughout journey, she suggested certain exercises and lab/scan tests with reason(s) behind them. I never felt anything was prescribed without reason. She will explain the reports of lab and scan test properly and you wouldn't go back home having any doubt in your mind. Her friendliness will let you clarify even the smallest and silliest doubt you might have. In 3rd trimester, I had some complications and was admitted to hospital (and was worried about pre-term), She handled it in a wonderful way and really helped me to keep positive mindset. Under her care, I delivered healthy baby boy via normal delivery at full term. My pregnancy felt like a wonderful journey due to her.\n\nI am extremely happy to have met her and highly recommend her.

I had border line sugar & hypo thyroid but the doctor controlled both sugar level and thyroid very neatly. She was very strict on my diet and regular monitor of sugar level. Also the doctor encourages for  normal delivery. I was very very sensitive towards any kind of pain and my whole family including myself not even thought in my dream that I would have deliver normally but It happened in reality only because I tried my level best to follow all the suggestion from diet to regular workout prescribed by the doctor. Presence of Dr Meeta in the labor  room gave me massive mental strength during the delivery. I remember I started walking just after 2 hrs after the delivery. Post delivery health recovery was very smooth for me.\nOnly cons I have found with Dr Meeta is that she keep herself very defensive in 1st two months of pregnancy and prescribes lot of tests to make sure that everything is  on the correct track.\n\nIn bottom line I can say if one can follow every instruction as Dr Meeta prescribes she will must get desired result  on time.",

Being parents,we were very scared to select a doctor and did a lot of research for a normal delivery. Finally, through a reference from my sister, We  came to Dr.Meeta. In one visit, we understands that she is the bestest doctor because she explained each and everything from my reports as my regular doctor did nothing. She tests me internal in a good way.She also trained me some exercises and in the healthy diet.\n\nI followed each and everything said by Meeta Mam.We totally trust her. \n\nFinally, the day comes for delivery, I got pains from the Morning(23/04/2022) On and Off. On night, I am unable to control, as the pains are heavy. So we admit hospital at 10.00 pm. The junior doctor monitor the nsr scan.The cervix length was .2cm diluted  when she induced. After 3 hours, contractions have started heavily as I was not able to control. The junior doctors came and  check it was diluted to .8cm and white bleeding \n\n The time comes,I admitted to labour room, after 15 min Meetha mam came and Finally I deliver a healthy 4.010gm  baby boy. It was a normal delivery.\n\nI am very glad to found her for my delivery. Our journey of delivery with Dr.Meetha and Cloudnine Hospital,Whitefield has been a memorable one.I strongly recommend Dr.Meetha.\n\n Thank you Dr.Meetha for your guidance,advice and support.We would rate 10/10 for Dr.Meetha",

Our first child was delivered normally in Sweden, a country where the healthcare system is one of the best in the world. We had been skeptical of experiences from our relatives in India. After some careful reference checks we decided to go for Cloudnine Whitefield and Dr Meeta Chawhan.I had developed complications like borderline Gestational diabetes and Cholestasis in my 3rd\u00a0trimester but the confidence with which Dr Meeta guided me is truly commendable. She encouraged me to take a healthy diet and keep myself active which really helped me throughout my pregnancy through logical perspectives. Even with these complications the doctor ensured a smooth normal delivery, thanks to all the staff at the Cloudnine hospital Whitefield for the smooth delivery and postpartum care.Dr. Meeta and cloudnine had been like a guide throughout our journey, somebody we always looked up to on various aspects of lifestyle and diet",

After the first consultation itself we got most of our questions answered and got the confidence that we can try for second child..\nRight from the time I conceived we were nervous but were ready to take utmost care. Meeta mam guided us really well, explained the situation at every stage and suggested what is good and why. She built confidence in us while not giving any false hopes or promises. She tries to keep the medications to minimum, insists on healthy diet while not over stressing on the supplements.\nWe are blessed with a healthy and beautiful baby boy now. Very happy with the guidance we received from her and we are forever grateful to Dr. Meeta. This has been a life changing event for us. \n\nStrongly recommend Dr. Meeta to whoever looking for a gynaecologist. Choosing her as my gynae is the best decision we made.. She is extremely professional and friendly... While consulting her you can be rest assured that everything will be taken care of.. We wish her all the happiness in the world.",

My overall experience with doc and hospital was excellent. Dr Meeta is very friendly in nature and very responsive too.she makes everything sound so easy & relaxing.she mostly advises on natural remedies rather than prescribing heavy meds. My baby was suspected to b borderline IUGR, however thanks to her early diagnosis & medication, we could avoid the problem before delivery. The thing I liked the most is we had a very detailed & healthy discussion on how we should proceed with the delivery and what would be best for both mom & baby. She made herself available when we needed the most. On the day of delivery everything was so well taken care of and the hospital also made the whole process seamless\n\nThe only thing I ever came close to complain is on hospital administration was the wait time on certain busy days . However that problem was tackled by taking early morning appointments, which was perfectly fine for us. \n\nI would highly recommend Dr Meeta for any pregnancy related visits. The positive vibe you get from the doc cant b any better any place else.",

She always motivates and kept us positive throughout 9 months. I have encountered  multiple issues during  my pregnancy like gastrational diabetes, less hemoglobin,  cold etc and what I liked most about her that she never prescribed many medicine to me even when I asked for and her recommended diet have done wonders. And everything went normal throughout the journey. Though we were nervous for the D-day but with the help of Dr. Meeta things went really well and smooth and I have recovered real fast. She is very positive, experienced, calm and explains everything in complete detail.. I always felt real comfortable to discuss everything during our consultations. I will recommend her for sure ... and you can consult her without having any second thoughts. I am really happy and satisfied with my experience of having a positive and healthy pregnancy with Dr. Meeta.",

It was pandemic situation all over the world and we were looking for a doctor nearby our residence. We  had positive vibes post meeting Meeta from the very first day. She guided us medically and emotionaly throughout this journey. She always recommended natural diet based remedies and exercises to remain healthy. She was a mentor apart from a doctor and helped us these 9 months to make sure our little angel arrived safely into this world. On July 24th we were blessed with a little princess and I still remember that night. We had gone on emergency to hospital as I couldn't feel fetal movements. She coordinated with the hospital staff and made all arrangements over phone and made sure she was there even at 11 PM on a Saturday night at hospital to deliver my little one. She made sure both my kid and me are safe today and we are very grateful to her! Looking for my post natal appointments with her. I'm already feeling healthy and energetic after just 20 days of my c section. All credit goes to her and her guidance throughout this journey!",

With all the struggles I had gone through to have a child, I was extremely nervous about this pregnancy. My husband had actually done some random net search to find a doctor, as we had just returned from the US and didn\u2019t know anyone in the city. In our mind, we were there just to confirm the pregnancy.  But after the first consultation, there were no second thoughts about changing to any other Gynaecologist.\nBest thing about Dr. Chawhan is her reassuring demeanour. Time and effort she took to always cheer up my spirits made sure that those nine months remained as a wholesome treasure of a memory with me. She is atypical for an allopathic doctor - thoughtful before prescribing unnecessary medication. She brings human touch to her interactions beyond lab reports and CT scans. *** ** **** ************* *** accommodative of cultural nuances that influence many decisions that expectant parents make. I am now bringing up a healthy and sparkling daughter and thank Dr. Meeta Chawhan for the part she played in bringing her to this world.\n",

She prefers simple yet effective home remedy solution for the treatment. She encourages healthy weight gain and exercise throughout the pregnancy.\n\nThere were some complications during first trimester. She provided great support to handle the situation and recover from it.\n\nI was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during second trimester. She advised not to take medicine rather control diet and monitor blood sugar level on regular basis. It worked out nicely.\n\nI was really worried when diagnosed with ICP and low amniotic fluid reported in the IG scan. Physical consultation was not available that time due to surge in Covid cases. She made me feel relax during video consultation and looked confident with healthy delivery. It took all my fear away. We are blessed with a healthy baby girl! Such experiences make the journey memorable and a happy one.\n\nI am fortunate to consult Dr. Meeta for my pregnancy. She is a doctor cum friend for me :-) I look forward to continue my post delivery check ups with her. Thank you mam for everything that you do..",

I immediately felt at ease and felt confident on every occasion I consulted with her. I never felt rushed and she always asked if I had any other questions. The best thing about her is that she always encourages  home remedies and she is easily approachable. During pandemic, video consultations were really helpful and made our life so easy.

Due to COVID, we could not arrange our parents visit, Dr Meeta ensured that she made all arrangements while getting admitted in hospital. Finally, we were blessed with baby boy, though C-section. Dr Meeta and her team took excellent care during the hospital stay.  I recovered quickly from the surgery and got back to my regular routine within a week's time.

I felt she is so much perfect in her job and all her predictions came true till delivery and post delivery as well. There were few complications in pregnancy like gestational diabetes and low placenta. I must appreciate the way she advised us which resulted in no issue at all till pregnancy.\nBest thing to commend her is that she focus on natural food to tackle all complications. We followed her instructions and blessed with healthy baby.  Post delivery consultants helped my wife to recover in 3 days after C section. This was unbelievable for us. \nCloudnine staff and nurses are so much compassionate that we felt everyone is like family. Care for mother and baby was so much that we never felt any need of attendant. They also taught us how to take care of baby after discharge like giving bath to baby, burping techniques, feeding techniques,  how to sooth crying baby, changing diapers too.\nWe are thankful to Cloudnine and Dr. Meeta and highly recommend others.",

In other words, she was a blessing for me, i will be grateful to her for life. \n\nThe first time i met her, we discussed at length my medical background and after hearing her out, i was relieved that i had made the right decision going to her for treatment. She immediately instilled in me the confidence and reassurance that everything would be alright under her care.\n\nThroughout the 9 months, she insisted on a healthy lifestyle and minimum medication which i think most patients look for.\nShe was also extremely patient to hear out all the concerns/queries and explained everything in full detail during all consultations. The patience and calmness with which she handled me and my concerns was reassuring that i and my baby were in great hands.\n\nDuring my third trimester, i had developed cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and my NST results were also not great. However, the skill and care with which she handled the situation was commendable. \nI delivered a baby boy under her care and will be always indebted to her.\nHighly highly recommend her!\nThanks doc and god bless you!\n\n\n",

When my husband and I got to know about my twin pregnancy, we were very much concerned about having a right Ons/Gynec, with whom I can feel comfortable as it was my 1st pregnancy and who can do the rightful thing to avoid premature delivery. \nAfter consulting with multiple doctors during my second trimester, I got the right positive vibes with Dr. Meeta, and hence I decided to continue with her. \n\nThe good thing about her, she listens calmly and explains each and every report, test, many things which we expecting mothers may experience. She also recommends only the necessary scans or tests to be done and asks us to avoid non-necessary hospital visits or even pregnancy accessories. \n\nWith\u00a0god's grace, we got blessed with twins, and she guided me well how can I take care of babies and myself.\n\nI do feel that we made the right decision at the right time. Thank You Thank You Ma'am, for making me comfortable during my pregnancy and post-pregnancy and giving us this happiness.",

I was in a devastated state and had lost trust in all doctors before meeting her. She's a lucky charm. The moment I started consulting her, every problem/assumptions assoicated with my pregnancy dissappeared. She insisted so much on Protein diet, no pain killers, just excercises. She encourages normal delivery and tries till the last moment for normal safe delivery. However, in my case, my cervix dint open on waiting for so long after my water broke naturally and ended up in an emergency C section and delivered a healthy baby boy. She answers to all questions patiently. She is the only Gyno in Bangalore that takes care of a proper consultation. She spends time in every consultation, gives you ample time to get your doubts clarified. To me she's the one who gave belief not all doctors are the same (Due to the bad experience I had in the first two trimesters).My baby & I will be forever grateful for the way she handled my last trimester\ud83d\ude4fI would highly recommend Dr. Meeta to anyone that needs a positive support throughout pregnancy!!",

She guided me well on what to expect and what not aptly in each trimester. Without going for unnecessary medications, she would encourage on taking good diet and the wonders that exercise and diet would do on the health of a mom and baby. This made it easy for me to take a good care of myself amidst managing household chores especially during the covid pandemic lockdown. Thanks for her approachability through video consultation whenever required(even during the period when I was away in hometown attending a family function in my third trimester, her advice on periodical tests followed by the required guidance continued).\nWith all the good care and guidance of Dr. Meeta, I delivered a baby boy in January (It was a Cesarean though as my first delivery was also the same) with a smooth post-pregnancy recovery. Many thanks to Dr.Meeta, the duty doctors and the staff of Cloudnine Whitefield for taking utmost care including covid precautions all through and making this journey of mine a happy one. ",

Little sceptical with our ongoing treatment there, we opted for video consultation with Dr. Meeta. The initial consultations with Dr. Meeta gave us sufficient confidence to move to Bengaluru and continue our journey with her at Cloudnine.\nShe stresses a lot on diet and exercise which I think are critical during pregnancy. She is very punctual and listens to you/your issues and has logical answers for all of them. And the moral support we received whenever we spoke with her just took away all our stress.\nFinally, I could deliver a healthy baby boy through elective C-Section (personal choice as I am fearful of elaborate operational procedures) though Dr. Meeta was insisting on normal delivery as I was healthy and had all parameters in place.\nPost my C-section, the diet that was followed for me as Dr. Meeta\u2019s patient was vegetables/fruits based and we were totally impressed.\nAll I can say is my family and I will always remain indebted to Dr. Meeta for her guidance and the happiness that she has brought to us in the form of our healthy, happy baby boy during such testing times :)",

Getting appointments, getting all tests done was easy even during covid time in cloudnine.\n\nDoctor was very friendly, professional and we always get positive vibes from her whether it was direct or video consultation.I would definitely recommend her to our aquaintances.\n\nThis was our first pregnancy journey and inspite of some health issues & covid related challenges the journey was smooth with the guidance of Dr. Meeta Chawhan..\ud83d\ude42\n\nBaby had less AC in her later ultrasound results  so doctor suggested to take more protein in diet also she added some protein and vitamin supplements for baby to gain weight asap. \n\nAs per doctor's suggestion, we waited till 40 weeks for natural labor but it didn't happened,  so I had to get admitted for induced labor at night on 16 November, 2020 but we had no luck after hours wait.\n\nBecause baby's heartbeats were dropping in process of induced labor, we had to go for an emergency ceaserian and after wait of 12-13 hrs of labor our beautiful, healthy baby girl was delivered safely by doctor Meeta through c-sec on 17 November,  2020.\n\nDoctors and staff were cooperative and friendly in our stay at cloudnine me and my husband both are grateful for all the care taken by them. \n\nThank you.",

I was consulting a different gynecologist for my pregnancy but at 31 weeks , I had severe pains and got admitted in cloudnine whitefield. Dr Meeta was saviour for me as she connected with my gynae and took my case. She tried to hold the pregnancy with all medications and in parallel prepared me and baby for delivery. But suddenly after 4 days I was in labor and delivered baby, thanks to Dr Meeta and team who were promptly available and delivered my baby. Me and my husband never expected such smooth experience of labor and delivery with Dr Meeta as she was a different gynae whom we first met just 3 days back. There are few points I want to highlight about Dr Meeta:\n1. She works with a plan and gets you prepared for all situations.\n2. Always available and answers all your queries with patience.\n3. Very friendly. You will always feel relaxed after talking to her.\n4. Always Recommends home medications.\n******* *** ** *** ** *** **** ***** ** ********* * **** ****\nThank you Dr Meeta. \n\n\n\n",

Its during 8th month when I have been diagnosed with GDM and she patiently have explained about the consequences of it if not been controlled any sooner, which eventually she managed to do with her expertise knowledge.I have given birth to our little princess via C-section during pandemic calmly which wouldn't have been possible without Meeta Ma'am.Its her positive attitude and professional way of handling the things with care that my 9 months of pregnancy just went like blink of an eye. I would highly recommend her as a gynaecologist.\n",

All through, Dr. Meeta was our solace, she treated me with minimum medication and maximum care. The climax was dramatic indeed, the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's hand, and probably the baby yanked the placenta, leading to what is called palacenta abruption i.e. placenta detached before the labour fully set in, leading to baby's pulse dropping sharply. Dr. Meeta recognized it immediately (bloody amniotic fluid) and did an emergency C-section and got out a healthy baby safely & switfly. She also removed the fibroid (which turned out to be non-malignant after the biopsy result). Dr. Meeta was a beacon of support all through my journey in  touching the shores of happy motherhood. And we are more than happy to recommend her for anyone aspiring for the same.",

She also gave equal importance to mental health.She always use to discuss all possible aspects of a scan/report and no matter what worried us  she always made us feel at ease by explaining it in a clear cut manner because of which i never felt fear or anxious and it also boosted my confidence , All of which helped me a lot to stay calm and composed even when i had to go through an emergency c-section a day before my due date.Thanks to her i delivered a healthy baby girl and had a quick recovery without any complications. We are thankful to Dr.Meeta for guiding us through the pregnancy and making it a memorable journey. Highly recommend her to anyone looking for a gynecologist.",

Her approach has always been holistic to focus not only on reports/ scans but also on diet, exercise, having right state of mind. Along with providing necessary medical guidance she supported on the psychological front which was very helpful for me during my pregnancy. There are so many blogs, articles online which are contradictory that confuse the expectant parents; but Dr. Meeta has always been very transparent and straight forward which gave us confidence to follow her advice without any ambiguity. She clearly explains all reports and reasons for what makes the body behave the way it is so that we get the assurance that such things are normal. She patiently answered even the silliest of my questions. I had gestational diabetes and severe acid reflux in the first few weeks. With the changes in diet suggested by her things got back to normal very soon and I had a smooth pregnancy. I also took reiki classes as suggested by her which helped with me stay positive and energetic. I could manage the workload at home and office work until my delivery. Dr. Meeta ensured the video consultation was no different from face to face consultations. Tests were suggested at the appropriate frequency inspite of lockdown and restrictions. Inspite of complications, with the right interventions I was able to deliver a healthy baby. Thanks to Dr. Meeta and the whole cloudnine team for the same.",

She has been very supportive throughout the phase of pregnancy and post delivery.We meet her at very early stage of pregnancy. *** ** ****** ************* *** explains so well about all the medical situations(positive or negative) upfront and her positive attitude makes us comfortable.As we we move further in our pregnancy she always suggested best care, best solutions, zero medicine and most importantly focused on home care. She always motivated us being 1st time parents and always focused on home based remedies primarily.   Her advice, suggestions made our pregnancy journey comforting even in this covid situation. For any kind of emergency she was always available throughout our journey, that was really helpful. During my delivery I would have given up completely with the kind of labour pain I had but it was only Dr Meeta who made it possible as a normal delivery for me. Most importantly the kind of positive vibes you get out of her in labour room is amazing. I am glad that I consulted her, She is just an amazing doctor for me.She is a blessing! knowledge rich expertise to handle pregnancy.Wish we had more doctors like her in all corners of Bangalore :)",

The best suggestion being \"Return to your normal routine as soon as possible after the delivery.\"\n\nMedically, she is the one who believes in \"minimum medication and maximum care\", I can say this from my experience. She prescribes medicines only when it is absolutely required.\n\nIn a nut shell: Dr Meeta was a doctor and friend for the whole time during the pregnancy. \n\nA heart felt thank you from me, my family and of course the little one whom you brought into my arms. :) ",

I was living in far corner of Bangalore and I was consulting with another doctor and when we shifted to our new home, I was worried about, how the new doctor would be and how she will treat me. I discussed with my sister in-law and she preferred Dr. Meeta Chawhan as my consultant because my sister in-law also consulted with Dr. Meeta Chawhan and she handled my sister in-law delivery very well. So I decided to go for Dr. Meeta Chawhan and at first meeting I knew that she is my doctor, she listened all my concerns and her way of talking  and treating me filled a self confidence within me. She always gave me valuable suggestions everytime when I get the chance to meet her. She is very intelligent. At this time of pandemic I consulted her on video call and she always gave me enough time to explain my condition and provide satisfactory solution for my questions. I will always be thankful to her for the care and love. Now I am a very fortunate mother of very cute little Angel. May God bless Dr. Meeta Chawhan, thankyou so much Mam. I would urge every one to ask for Dr. Meeta Chawhan as thier consultant, she is very kind and generous doctor. Thanks",

The first meeting with her went so smooth that we made up our minds to go ahead with her. Since the beginning I wanted a normal delivery and she supported me during my entire pregnency by guiding me towards it gradually. Her straight forward attitude with no false promises kept us on toes throughout 9 months. She always insisted on home remedies/traditional methods and never kept me on medicines which I liked the most. I was rather directed to stay active and continue to work till I got into labor. I continued my workout routine with excersize as directed. She keeps a close eye on vitals and diet and puts you back on the plan with no tolerance. I still can't forget how she entered the OT and made things looks so simple. We were blessed with a baby boy on 11th of July and we sincerely thank Dr. Meeta for being the guiding light for us. I'm definitely reaching out to her if at all we plan our second. :)\nThanks\nPriyanka",

The kind of care, guidance and support i received from Dr Meeta throughout my pregnancy has been phenomenal. She listened to all my queries patiently and answered them categorically. She made sure to reassure me and instil confidence in me throughout my consultation.  Her expertise in prescribing right medications (home remedies if applicable) at the right time is remarkable and highly appreciated.  Most important of all, i had to make an emergency visit to the hospital late night and was rushed to the labour room by the emergency medical team. Dr Meeta who happened to be off the duty at that time was informed about the situation and she was by my side in few minutes comforting me and ensured that i had a safe normal delivery!! I am thankful to Dr Meeta for the wonderful support she has extended towards me and would strongly recommend her to anyone looking for pregnancy care.",

I use to visit most of my sister's consultations with Dr. Meeta. After those visits and delivery, I loved the way she interacted with my sister. It may be the confidence that she gives to her patient, It may be the solution she gives for each problem which can occur. Or It may be the atmost care they take during the delivery time. \n\nExperiencing all this as a third person, It has become a very easy decision for me to opt for a consultation with Dr. Meeta for my baby delivery. \n\n1. The Confidence she gave me has helped me come out with all smiles after each consultation and in having a smooth delivery. \n2. She used to provide apt solution for each problem I had during the pregnancy time. \n3. The care they took for me during the delivery time is unforgettable. \n\nOn top of all these she is so sweet to talk and makes you comfortable. \n\nI would rate 10/10.\n\nThank you., \nManasa. \n\n\n\n",

But everything kind of changed positively after consulting Dr. Meeta. I delivered a healthy 3.1kg baby in 37th week via c-sec as per the plan. Due to low birth weight of 1st baby my health condition was monitored closely. First thing is she instantly makes you feel comfortable and feeds positive energy into you. I was so free to discuss even petty things that I was facing during the term and she patiently advises on how to handle them. *** ******* ********* *********** ********** ****** she gives lot of home remedies. I never had high BP during this term. Her food diet chart was the best with more protein in it. I followed it religiously that way I had put on only 10kgs and 3 days after delivery i had reduced by 8/9 kgs. Whole family is happy with her.

I opted for c-section procedure for my delivery and she guided me throughout my entire journey from day 1 till I delivered just perfectly. She is herself a very positive person and ensures that her patients also stay optimistic throughout. *** ********* *** experience in her field is immense and it shows in the way she deals with every question and situation that comes before her. I have to say one more thing, when I was in the OT for my procedure, I was very scared and anxious (it's quite natural to feel so), but just a sight of Dr. Meeta in the OT got me my confidence back and soon after half n hour Dr. Meeta announced the arrival of my new born. During the recovery process as well, Dr Meeta personally monitors her patients and her team ensures nothing is done without Dr. Meeta's consultation. I highly recommend Dr. Meeta.

Moreover I was suffering from PCOS and it was my first pregnancy at age of 30 which made me more cautious to choose my ob-gyn. I zeroed upon Dr. Meeta seeing her education and experience. Coincidentally she did her studies from my home town and home state which is one of the best colleges to get for medical studies. \nBeyond expectations Dr. Meeta turn out be even better. Because of following things I feel about her. \nShe is very friendly towards her patients. \nShe is kinda doctor who helps her patients with not only medicines but also lifestyle, diet and exercises.\nI am no expert but I believe pregnancy is all about lifestyle, diet and exercises and medicines are kinda supportive though I was suffering from PCOS.\n\nAbove all she is always cheerful even cheered up me in OT when I was in lot of pain :p\n\nWith her helps I enjoyed my pregnancy a lot and now I have a little bundle of joy in my arms. \n\nThanks a lot ma'am :) \n",

And encouraged to do daily exercises, healthy diet for being healthy during the pregnancy term.\nHer advice's works like magic.  My wife's pregnancy was a bit tough as she was diagnosed with short cervix at week 27 and we had to count each and every day praying that the pregnancy continues strong.\nDr. Meeta's  positive guidance during this time of the pregnancy  specially helped my wife overcome the mental and the physical stress.\nIn-fact with her advice , encouragement and precautions , pregnancy continued till the 39th week and delivered a healthy baby.\nMy wife had her labor started at night and we rushed to hospital. She came to hospital  at 3 am  in morning, almost in no time, since everything was unplanned and happening so fast.  \nWe'll always grateful to Dr Meeta Chavhan for gifting us our bundle of love since the pregnancy was a role coaster.",

She is very friendly, lively n informative. I used to feel energetic n positive after talking to her. She cared for me and addressed all my concerns patiently. She explained us what can be known from each scan and why do we need that.  She will highlight the positive side even though if something is not good. She gave a diet chart to keep the weight in control and for every check up she instructed me what to do before the next check up. She kept me motivated throughout the pregnancy. As there is an issue with babys position she prepared us that it can either be a normal delivery or a c section. As I haven't got pains even after 40 weeks she suggested for pain induction. I got pains after few hours but my baby passed motion meanwhile. As babys heart beat is getting affected, she decided for an emergency c section. They rushed me to the OT in few minutes and took the baby out.  My baby n I are in good health. Thanks to Meeta for making my pregnancy journey a cakewalk. ",

I just delivered normally though I had few complications like gestational diabetes, previous history of miscarriage . Dr meeta made sure that I had normal delivery and tried her level best and encouraged me and supported me throughout my pregnancy . She never prescribed unnecessary medicines or tests and always encourage natural remedies. She encouraged me to be active throughout my pregnancy which eventually helped me to recover on time post delivery . Best part about Dr meeta is that she took right decision at the right time as she suggested for an early delivery at 37 week as she was not satisfied with the last ultrasound. I must say she is an amazing and talented doctor and she always stressed on eating right so that I will not gain unnecessary weight. \n\nI am really glad that I took the right decision to choose her as my doctor.\n\nI would like to thank her for giving me the best pregnancy experience . \n\nShe is extremely friendly , patient while listening, give enough time to the patients.

It was great to get Dr Meeta Mam's help and support during my pregnancy. She is really nice and understanding and she always welcomes the patient with a smile... Have never seen a doctor so friendly, so polite like her. My pregnancy is full of complications but every time she used to calm down with her nice words and explained all my queries from the day one when I first visit till delivery. She gives enough time and patiently listens our queries. She encourages for proper diet, exercise and only important medication.I was under care of Dr Meeta until baby delivery and she really handled all the complications that arose during my pregnancy very well. Her guidelines helped me to stay fit and active throughout my pregnancy, and I managed my office and household work till one week prior to my expected delivery date (and just one week prior to my baby's birth). I am very much nervous about c-section but she did the delivery normal one.\n\nMe and my husband really wants to thanks for all the care and support provided and making baby delivery memorable one. I would happily refer anyone to her and I have already recommended her to my friends and relatives.",

I had issues with high sugar levels from the first trimester and she helped me through that with proper diet and exercises. The best thing is , no unnecessary medications were administered by her but rather she suggested many home remedies . I wanted to have Normal delivery and she supported me with proper exercises through out the pregnancy and finally I have healthy baby girl with Normal delivery. My suggestion to whoever is planning to visit Dr Meeta, Please listen to her and follow her instructions without fail. ",

Because of my obesity, hypothyroidism & piles, I was pretty worried about my unborn child & delivery. But everything went smooth under her guidance. She tried her level best for normal delivery but labour induction failed so I insisted for C section. So she did that. She explained everything in details but final decision was from ourside. Everything went so well that I recovered externally within 8 to 10 days. She helped me a lot by guiding & prescribing minimal medication. Even after delivery, she is taking care of all postnatal condition. I would love to recommend her to my nearer & dearer.  I wish I would have visited her during my first pregnancy too. ",

Not sure how much you remember about us as you have so many people to see on daily basis. \n\nWe went to Dr Meeta, when we started planning for our first baby. She guided us throughout the pregnancy for each and everything.\n\nAlso suggested some key steps to be taken for NVD.  \n\nApart from some minor complications here and there she made sure that we didn\u2019t face any issue during the pregnancy. \n\nDuring labor also she was regularly checking with us and we have a perfectly healthy baby delivered normally along with a healthy mother. \n\nI couldn\u2019t ask anything more. It was such a blessing to find a doctor like her.",

The doctor was friendly and during this conversation she asked me about plans for a baby and guided me with pre- pregnancy councelling as i was also suffering from mild PCOD . So when i got pregnant i did not have to think twice to choose her as my gynec. \n\nHer approach is more related to changing lifestyle than prescribing unnecessary tablets . I also had gestational diebetis which got diagonised in the 1st trimester itself and she guided me through it all through my pregnancy by weekly tracking my diet and sugar levels. I also had IUGR and she gave me realistic expectations around the baby weight and health. \n\nOverall i would recomend her for pregnancy related care.. Especially if its a high risk pregnancy please do consult her. ",

Apart from her friendliness, she is extremely knowledgeable and  has a lot of experience in handling high risk pregnancy.. my journey was also very tough..firstly i got pregnant after 11 years of marriage sonit was a very precious pregnancy... in my very first scan i was diagnosed with hematoma which in simple terms meant that i had a high risk of miscarriage ..i was kind of devastated bt Dr. Meeta put me in bed rest and monitored me closely. I also had vaginal bleeding in my first trimester and then at the later stage was diagnosed with umbilical vein varix which is a very very rare condition. I was crying after getting the diagnosis (being a professor and researcher  in human genetics, i could understand the implications of the diagnosis) and still remember how Dr. Meeta calmed me and explained that how she has handled such cases in her professional career and that the outcome was positive in all such cases.. Also she encouraged and motivated me throughout my  pregnancy to eat healthy as she was concerned about the baby gaining proper weight..\nIt was for her medical advice, guidance and instructions  that i was able to give birth to a beautiful baby girl and recovered easily from c section.  Thanks is too small a word bt still thank u dr. Meeta for making my tough journey easier..\n",

My Dr Meeta Chawhan is very supportive, experienced and guided to us very nicely at every stage of my pregnancy. \nDuring my first and second trimester of my  pregnancy , I was consulting Dr Kamal Unikrishna. But In last trimester she refuse to take my case, reason best known to her only.  Me and my husband were in shocked and feared due to her non- professional behavior.\nThen we rushed to C9 Whitefield, they advised us to contact Dr Meeta Chawhan. When we met Dr. Meeta Chawhan and discuss our case and problem in detail with her, then she told us \"Need not to worry, I am taking you case\". She investigate my case very sincerely and seriously and gave us clear information and guidelines for normal delivery. She also gave us her personal number and said \" You can contact me any time in case of emergency \".  It make us relaxed. \nAfter that I contact her so many times over phone for my queries in odd and normal hours. Every time she replied to my queries positively and satisfied me with proper guidelines. \nOn my delivery day I went to the hospital in evening but she was not present there at that time. But as the team of C9 informed her about my condition, She immediately rushed toward hospital and, attended and handled my case very efficiently. Finally I gave birth to healthy baby boy (3.4 Kg) through normal delivery. \nReally me and my husband are very thankful to Dr. Meeta Chawhan who helped, handled and guided us time to time very professionally, efficiently and positively. \nThus I would say that Dr Chawhan is well experienced, nice, very professional who guides properly to all the patients.\nIn my opinion all the pregnant women should consult her for her safe and normal delivery.

She is always very to the point in the treatment. At the same time she is friendly and highly professional. She even attended patients (was one of them) when she was expected to be at home for personal difficult time during covid. It\u2019s a very unique in any doctor. \nRegarding her treatment, I was completely new in this as was first time expecting . But the way she handled I followed her each and every suggestion. Rather I would say I blindly followed her prescription and her suggestion in every visit. She always suggested natural things for any complications during pregnancy. And trust me it worked so well, my complete journey was very smooth. . I did not gain any extra weight after delivery. I can share my true feelings about her. \nAfter delivery check up also she was very right to the point. She gives her patient very well diagnosed comments. Even when I was worried for many reasons she helped me to overcome very easily. She has very good patience and tight attitude to understand our mind. Highly ethical person. \nAfter delivery I truely missed her visit.  Suggesting her for pregnancy is a very small gesture. She is wonderful, if you are new in Bangalore, please just go to her and she ll handle well till the moment you hear your baby\u2019s voice. \nLastly, thank you to such medical practitioner, thank you Dr Meeta. Thank you for being there always . Wish you a great journey always.",

Who does talks like this to a patient who is suffering with pain? ** **** *** ******** ** ** ******** ******* ** * *** ******** **** **** ** ** ********* * **** * **** **** ** *** *** **** **** **** But that day I was just patiently standing in the room and helplessly tolerating her arrogance because the well-being (or life) of my wife and my newborn daughter was in her control. \nShe apparently believes that doctors have rights to treat their patients in whatever way they want. **** *** ******* ********** ** **** **** * ******* ********* We spent a decent 850 bucks for every consultation with her.

She helped us prepare ourselves both physically and mentally for this beautiful journey through natural lifestyle changes and some pre check-ups.One thing which really maks me appreciate her way of dealing with prenatal journey, is her major reliance on natural home remedies for treatment and quite minimal usage of medicines, unless absolutely required. From mental conditioning to providing confidence during anxious times, she has been a great support in my magical journey. Her focus on yoga, exercises and keeping oneself mobile and active even till last weeks of delivery is what sets her apart and helped me deliver baby with a minimal of labour pain one can imagine.

Every time we came out of her cabin, we had a big smile on our face and great relief. Being it 9 am or 5 pm, her energy level was always high and she stayed calm to answer all our doubts. We went for elective C section. Dr. Meeta made it so comfortable for me, within 2 days I got discharged and was easily able to do household chores within few days. \nWe would never forget her help and guidance for bringing our little bundle of joy into this world..\n",

With the confidence she gave me, I was active until the evening I got admitted for delivery.She has been quite practical with her approach, right from day 1. Her approach on using medicines just as a supplement and making the best out of our daily diet helped me gain the optimum amount of weight throughout my pregnancy. With her constant motivation and push, I attempted to learn swimming during my pregnancy too. She helps you take informed decisions at all points in time. All of this, to ensure the delivery process goes as smooth as possible. Although I ended up delivering my baby through an emergency C-section, all of the activities I did all along, helped me recover super fast. Would definitely recommend!",

She described each stage of my pregnancy and what I liked the most is her focus towards limited usage of medication by taking natural alternatives. Another thing which I loved is that she described various options for any situation or issue which I can chose while being very clear on critical points. We both decided our next course of action based on facts from medical examination rather than preconceived notions. My surgery went well which ensured a successful delivery with a healthy baby. \nI have fully recovered within 15 days and am able to do everything as usual thanks to her post delivery support. Wanted to convey my deepest thanks for her support throughout pregnancy.",

It is our first child, but all over the pregnancy period, she has supported emotionally and guided us properly for the next step. She always prefers natural ways rather than prescribing so many medicines. Also, she always motivates to do exercises and remain active, doesnt prescribe unnecessary tests/ scans etc. Because of her support and guidance we were able to have normal delivery for which she encourages first if there are no complications. Overall it was an excellent experience with her, I advise all to go with her without any doubt.",

She is so knowledgeable, confident and cheerful that even if you are sad or tensed about something , while coming out of her cabin, you would be cheerful! She made pregnancy look like cakewalk for me!\nHer prescription includes minimal medication and she suggested home remedies too when required!\n\nShe was unintentionally my therapist too for the pregnancy. I regained confidence just by talking to her!\n\nShe is magical and I would blindly recommend her to everyone!",

Meeta mam made sure that our questions are answered and her enthusiasm and expertise made us at ease during our every visit. We had faced few issues during our early pregnancy which she helped us overcome with confidence\n\n Looking back, My labor day did not go as expected mainly because of the extremely poor management by the hospital but my pregnancy journey was really memorable all thanks to Meeta Mam. I had a C section delivery with no complications for which I thank Meeta mam and her team. My post-partum recovery was really smooth and I could easily vouch for Meeta mam\u2019s professional expertise in the matter. I would highly recommend her!",

Also, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my 7th month. Dr. Meeta handled my case with utmost care. She is a very patient, friendly, supportive, and committed doctor. Although my biometry (Hadlock) indicated that my baby might be underweight, I was able to deliver a healthy baby weighing 3.1 kg. It became possible because of the exceptional guidance provided by Dr. Meeta.\n\nMy mantra during my entire pregnancy has been \"trust Dr. Meeta and follow her advice.\" She is a star doctor. I strongly recommend her!\n\nThank you, doctor, for the miracle you have brought to our lives.",

Rather than jumping directly onto medicines, she would suggest to go for natural remedies for any kind of health concern that is faced during pregnancy. \n\nOverall it was a great experience with her and I was able to enjoy and felt safe under her guidance during my whole pregnancy and post delivery phase. All thanks to Dr Meeta.",

She also tried her utmost for a normal delivery but since the pain didn\u2019t aggravate, C section was required which I must admit went on so smoothly. \n\nI was very touchy about the movements of the baby and if everything was going smooth, Dr Meeta always allayed my fears and ensured the happiness quotient was intact. She made sure my weight was under control esp because I have a tendency to put on! \n\nGift yourself the experience of a great pre and post pregnancy under Dr Meeta\u2019s guidance, thank you Doctor:))",

I came to Bangalore after baby shower during my 7th month and a growth scan was taken and found my baby weight was just 1.3kg and the amniotic fluid around the baby was in border 9.3. I had IUGR, however she guided me the right way to follow diet with required proteins for a day along with required suppliments for baby growth. She also educated about baby lung maturity issue in case of reduction in amniotic fluid and guided on getting betametasome injected for same. Initially when I heard these issues i was sure my delivery would go for a c section as I was expecting my baby would be underweight but because I followed her instructions my baby weight was normal and I was able to try for normal delivery and it was a success. She has always explained the situation of the medical condition well. She is enthusiastic and positivity in her speech makes me enthusiastic as well. Wonderful experience and thank you doc for everything ",

Despite a super packed schedule she always attends with utmost patience.\n\nFrom my first consultation to the after discharge support and care I was very pleased with the whole experience. I don't think I would have managed to have a normal delivery if I didn't not have a doc like her. Given my high functioning anxiety; a professional and competent doctor like her was a prerequisite.\n\nI would highly recommend her for a smooth pregnancy and delivery experience. Haven't met a better gynaecologist and obstetrician before. The tireless effort and work she puts in for you as a patient is a sheer blessing.

I felt she never prescribed any unnecessary medication. During last trimester though my sugar levels were high, she encouraged me to control it through proper diet without any medication. She always advised on right weight gain, healthy protein intake and physical activity. Following the routine prescribed by her helped me in delivering a healthy baby and kudos to her. Thank you so much Doctor for such a sweet and positive experience.. we will always cherish it. I will definitely recommend Dr Meeta chawhan to all expecting mothers for a healthy and safe pregnancy.

The time she takes to share all the information with the patients is the highlight.. she was never in a hurry and explained in detail about each and every symptoms during each trimester..it's been 2 yrs now after I became a Mother and still I continue to consult with Dr.Meeta for all my gynacological problems. I am happy to say that she is the best thing happened to me and I thank her for all the happiness she brings to her patients through her dedication and service oriented mind. Wishing her all the very best!! ",

She is one of the most polite, humble and professional doctor one can come across. One of the many best thing about Dr. Meeta is she never prescribes allopathy medicine until necessary and recommends homemade remedies. Just 10 days before the due date, my wife suffered from gastritis attack with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. Dr. Meeta handled it with ease and encouraged us during the difficult time. \nFinally the delivery was as smooth as pregnancy and we became proud parents of our baby boy. \nWe are already endorsing her to our friends and strongly recommending for anyone looking for pre and post delivery care.",

She gives enough time to explain each report and future plans, even during video consultations. She does not give lots of medicines and believe in home remedies. In November we were blessed with a baby boy. Thanks to Dr Meeta Chawhan for her knowledge and experience in handling complex pregnancy, for having positivity and keeping her patients confident.

Finally I delivered a baby boy in October 2019 by normal delivery without any complication. I'm really thankful to Dr. Meeta and would highly recommend her.",

During entire pregnancy she stuck to natural food and remedies vs medicines. She was able to diagnose any deviations early on with necessary tests and was able to course correct with right medication/natural remedies during the pregnancy. She pushed for normal delivery till the end despite all the odds to ensure normal delivery. Only when there was no possibility of normal delivery, she suggested C-Section and delivered the baby safely. Also, she ensured the post delivery recovery to be smooth despite my health issues. \n\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience with Dr. Meeta and Cloudnine. I would like to recommend to others who wants to consult a caring doctor and push for normal delivery. ",

The best part is thatb she doesn't prescribe extensive medication unless it's absolutely necessary and believes in holistic health and well-being. The diet and exercise regimen that she had suggested has helped me to stay active and a smooth post partum recovery.  I'm super glad that we chose her and forever grateful for her service.",

After some time with that doctor, i finally conceived after 7 years. Once conceived, it was a very easy decision to go back to Meeta madam.\nIt has been an exhilarating journey of 9 months with its own share of ups and downs.one thing that has been static during this time was Meeta madam's unfaltering support. \nPositive qualities about her are:-\n1. She does not suggest any unnecessary medicine.\n2. She has a memory of super computer.\n3. You will get response on your urgent whatsapp ping anytime provided it's urgent.\n4. She is strict if you are not disciplined.\n\nI will definitely recommend her any day for a fulfilling maternity experience.\n\nThank you so much doctor for the utterly bitterly gift.",

She also takes the time to explain issues and the trade-offs related to treatment alternatives. My pregnancy had complications, she was not only proactive in arranging the treatment, but also managed to give us a good overview of our options in a high-pressure environment. She bats for normal delivery.I would highly recommend her.",

One best thing about her was, she never prescribed any allopathic additional medicines during pregnancy, always she suggested to have normal home remedies. And she would explain what all to add. As I got my labor pain around 11pm, she had also rushed to the hospital and took care till i deliver my baby. I would strongly recommend Meeta mam for anyone who wants to have normal vaginal delivery.",

Her prime approach always was to follow home remedy and to take medications/external supplements when home remedy does not work in favour. All this alongside her positive and motivational attitude helped me in staying fit and active not just during pregnancy but also post deliver and in quick recovery with my C-Section. I am trully thankful to her and would definitely recommend her to everyone.",

My overall experience with doctor was excellent. Dr Meeta is very friendly in nature and very responsive too. She mostly advises on natural remedies rather than prescribing heavy medicine. Her diet plan really helped me throughout my pregnancy. My baby was suspected to be borderline IUGR, however thanks to her early diagnosis & medication. We avoided it before delivery and delivered a full term baby. She encourages normal delivery . When I left hope for a normal delivery, she kept me calm and tried her best for a normal delivery. One must visit her for all their gynae problems. Thank you doctor  :)",

She guided us with the best advice, treatment and also no unnecessary medications. She believes in natural remedies rather than medicines.

Medicines were prescribed only if they were absolutely necessary otherwise she always recommended a balanced diet, physical activities and most important of all - positive mindset. She understood that every factor, however minor, is still a factor, and she dealt with each one head on.

She was extremely confident, something that a nervous first time parent could totally appreciate. Was detected with a short cervix and advised bed rest with medication. The way Dr Meeta handled and explained (without an iota of panic) was commendable. Infact we went for a second opinion out of sheer fear of losing the pregnancy, and suggested alternate treatment, however she stood her ground throughout and asked us to take it one day at a time. We continued consulting her and finally delivered with her. Would highly recommend her if you are looking for a fairly professional and a straight forward obstetrician. Can\u2019t thank her enough for the confidence she gave us and the way she handled us.",

We started consulting her from the month of April 2021 and right from day 1 she always was like a guardian and her suggestions for better health were always with no or very less medical aids .She was more focussed towards natural home remedies. Her energy levels and involvement with us in the journey was a real relaxation for having mental peace after every consultation done. With her efforts and prescriptions along with almighty's blessings we had a new member in the family with no complications at all. Overall a happy rewarding experience with doctor Meeta. Please do visit her for any medical support needed without any second thoughts. Thank you.\ud83d\ude4f",

She always recommends home remedies as much as feasible which is a huge plus. Does not exaggerate things - at the same time explains the issue very clearly and resolves it. She is very friendly and is very punctual. Her positive approach to every single issue is significant. ******* *** ** *** ** *** ****** ************* *** *** ***** ****",

As it was  my first pregnancy I had a lot of doubts and questions which were taken care patiently from her side, with the additional guidance of do's and don't in every single visit. She was also a big moral booster  in terms of positive thinking and at the same time made  practical possibilities clear with a certain amount of ease.  I totally recommend her to other patients  and am sure they will be as happy and satisfied as me.",

She had provided timely suggestions on supplements and food intake so  that baby has healthy weight gain. Irrespective of whether its a video consultation or in person consultation at the hospital, the interactions with her have been hassle free and smooth. She explains what to expect out of lab & scan reports and ensures that the patient is completely aware of all the tests and the state of their body. This gives a lot of confidence. Overall the complete journey has been very smooth and delivered a healthy baby.",

Like the way doctor managed from day 1 by making things simple and suggesting nothing beyond what was required. Often in India, pregnancy is dealt as a medical condition, but Dr Meeta's comment \"you are pregnant not sick\" helped me break all stereotypes associated with pregnancy. I had a smooth pregnancy period, though I had gestational diabetes. Had some complication post delivery but finally over all of it. So, follow what the doctor says and you shall see the benefits. ",

Considering my advanced age, a normal delivery was possible only under her expert care and supervision. Above all she comes across as a normal down to earth, practical human being! ",

To avoid frequent hospital visits, Doctor encouraged video consulting initially which was very useful. She clarified all our doubts and more importantly, doctor always recommended home remedies before writing down tablets. It is hard to find such doctor's! She encouraged to do exercises which helped in the recovery post delivery. She is an absolute professional and speaks to the point. Her diagnosis is always right and we had a very pleasant experience and continue to see her post delivery as well. Highly recommend her. ",

She always encourages to go by simple home remedies which works 100%. When the reports are not as expected she explains both positive and negative side of it, which will help us taking right decisions. My NT scan was not as expected and my glucose was up and down throughout pregnancy, her treatment was awesome as it gave us confidence and lot of hopes to move forward. \nThank you so much for your care and support. Thanks to Cloudnine for providing good support for moms via doctor Meeta chawhan. I had recommended Meeta for one of our neighbours, they did consult for pregnancy care.

She Consulted and guided me like a friend in all those difficult stages of pregnancy... My delivery was C-Sec as baby heart rate was falling after fair attempt for approx 12hrs of labour...\nAlso, taking this opportunity i would like to thank Meeta mam for taking care of me as well as my little one during this special time or rather journey of our life... !!!",

Amidst the pandemic it was scary to visit hospital for checkup so Dr Meeta was encouraging to have video consultation to minimise the frequent visits to hospital. Second advantage of having video consultation was that my husband being able to talk with doctor.Dr Meeta was always giving home remedies for any problems rather than giving artificial supplements and during follow-up she will make sure to ask if we are following the home remedies or not. She will always encourage to enjoy pregnancy journey. She was always giving confidence for normal delivery and finally it happened for me even though I had some problems.She considers each pregnancy as unique one and always ready to clear our doubt.Choosing a right doctor during pregnancy journey is very important and I was under safe hands \ud83d\ude0a",

My wife was about 33yrs of age when we became pregnant with our 2nd baby. In all honesty, despite the age, the 2nd pregnancy was much better than 1st. During the delivery, her blood platelets and haemoglobin were far better than the 1st time. Also, she was able to recover from the postpartum stress relatively sooner than the 1st time and all thanks for Dr. Meeta for that.\n\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Meeta!\n\nThankyou Dr. Meeta!",

I really appreciated that she took the time to patiently address my questions and provide exhaustive guidance. Her approach is very unique - providing more stress on natural healing, positivity, and home remedies, instead of loads of tests or medications. She persistently encouraged me to eat healthily and exercise well which helped me throughout and post-pregnancy. Despite few complications, I had a smooth pregnancy under the guidance of Dr. Meeta. I was amazed by the care and positivity that she shows towards her patients. I highly recommend Dr. Meeta to anyone who's looking out for an Obstetrician-Gynecologist in Bangalore.",

We started treatment from 6 months of pregnancy and we were explained well with what to expect in the coming days. As a rheumatoid patient, my wife was given great confidence and positive support everytime we visited the doctor with her mesmerizing energy. We are now blessed with a healthy baby and thanks a ton for the doctor. We are clearly instructed with the post natal care and are almost back to normal lives She is a living angel and I definitely recommend Meeta Chawhan.",

Everytime I used to visit her I used to be more positive and happy about the journey. She never prescribed too many medicines rather she recommends home remedies (which was a very welcome surprise) My pregnancy was really smooth under her guidance . She always kept me patient and happy and I was always looking forward for the next appointment and next stage. Thanks to her for all the support . I\u2019d recommend her to all who are on to this beautiful journey. ",

I conceived in the month of  March\u201920 and my search for a gynecologist started, there are so many good doctors but I wanted a doctor who can be with me anytime I wanted and till my 5th month of pregnancy I was not getting a doctor who can provide me a comfort zone. \nI was very much tensed as was not getting a doctor I wanted in my journey. But my search came to an end when I met Dr. Meeta, she has a positive attitude and provided great guidance throughout. The way she gives confidence is superb, I had to carry this journey all by myself as my husband had to stay back with my elder one who is 3.5yrs, the way she has taken care of me is more like a family member.\nWith her hardwork and god\u2019s grace we are blessed with a baby girl, would be thankful to god that Dr.Meeta came in our life.  \nThankyou Dr. Meeta for everything.",

At a time when doctors prescribe lot of medicines her approach is always home remedies first and then go for medication if required. Such approach is missing with doctors now a days. During my delivery, she had a sprain in her leg but still she never allowed her health problems come in her professional life and delivered the baby safely. She always encouraged for normal delivery. My recommendations would be to visit her during initial days of pregnancy and you will surely find a motherly care taking doctor. ",

I faced issues like low lying placenta, low amniotic fluid, low baby weight and low Hb level, but all of that was very well taken by her and the end result was that I had a normal delivery with no complications. She was always there to stand for all these issues and used to give me solutions.She is a go-to doctor without thought for the pregnancy and other related issues. Just follow what she says and you will not regret.",

Cloudnine Whitefield is a horrible branch but fortunately for them their doctors are their saving grace. Especially doctor Meeta.\nDue to covid situation I only meet Dr. Meeta in my 6 th month of pregnancy and how I wish I had meet her from the very beginning. She is very patient and calm. Explains very clearly and preps you through the whole process. Her suggestions in regards to nutrition and physical activity are very valuable and made my journey very comfortable and easy. Even when it comes to delivery she knows when to push for a normal delivery and when to suggest if c section is required. Perfect guidance for a first time mothers like me who are anxious and scared. Thanks to the doctor my pre delivery and post delivery has been very easy and convenient and my recovery has been quick as well.\nI couldn't have asked for a better doctor.",

She took care of every aspect of pregnancy right from baby\u2019s health, mother\u2019s health and a smooth delivery. She advised me what is the right amount of weight gain and asked me to put a check on unnecessary weight gain. This is a rare advice that any gynaecologist would give. I followed the food habits(natural protein rich) recommended by her and could see the results. \nI would certainly recommend Dr Meeta Chauhan for any pregnancy related consultation. \n",

It is so important to have a good, ************* ****** who understands your concern and makes you comfortable and gives confidence. She is frank, upfront, friendly but at the same time pure professional. She knows what she is doing and preps you well for the entire journey of motherhood.

Thanks to Dr. Meeta for making our pregnancy journey an easy one.\nNow we are blessed with baby boy. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend her.",

She had a proper plan on how i could get over every week of my pregnancy with a consistant evaluation of my sugars. Since its very difficult especially to find the right stopgaps for our cravings during this period. As a doctor she is very friendly and cleared all our doubts patiently. I could definitely say that its only because of Dr Meeta, we had a very smooth journey and delivered a healthy baby boy. In pregnancy the bonding with the doctor is very important since its a long special and intimate journey. And for us that was perfect with Dr Meeta. All her advices helped us face the little complications that happened in the last trimester with much confidence. I Would certainty reccomend dr.Meeta for pre and post delivery care.",

Major positives for me were:\n1. She has good knowledge and experience and will answer all queries in detail and explain things very clearly.\n2. She relies on natural methods and would always suggest ways for maintaining a healthy pregnancy explaining the dos and donts.\n3. She handles her team well and cordinated the delivery process smoothly in the labor room and OT and has guided well during the post pregnancy recovery phase.\n",

She treated pregnancy as a life stage to be enjoyed and ended every appointment with a \u2018go enjoy\u2019 , which made us very confident throughout the whole affair. She was meticulous about all the tests and tracking which needed to be done. We felt she was very scientifically inclined and did not heed much to old wives tales. My wife ended up having a normal delivery and the pre and post delivery care was excellent. We would highly recommend her if you are looking for a healthy and normal pregnancy.",

I really appreciate the fact that she takes the time to make me feel secure and explain the different situations. She always answer present in case of emergency at anytime, which was really reassuring while I was pregnant. She delivered our beautiful baby boy by C-section: I am glad to say that she did an amazing job and she followed me up really good during recovery.

As I proceeded with the pregnancy , her confidence gave me confidence as well .She is very positive and straight forward with her patients. Doctor Meeta generally advices home remedies instead of medicine .She prefers normal delivery but we chose c section and  in operation theatre also she explained me the procedure and finally I delivered a healthy baby boy . I would recommend her to anyone . Thank you so much ",

My 1st delivery had some complications and resulted in preterm delivery of my baby. Dr Meeta looked at all my previous scans and reports thoroughly to understand the case properly. She  ensured by means of tests that this time I dont face the same complications.She gave me minimum medicines during pregnancy and focused more on being healthy by following good diet and home cooked food. She would give lot of time to answer any and all queries we had.Her positivity and enthusiasm was infectious always rubbing on to us as well.We had a uncomplicated delivery at full term and a healthy baby boy. Thanks to Dr Meeta!",

To our surprise the duty doctor who attended me was aware about my health and symptoms before I reached.It was really impressive and comforting that Dr Meeta took my health so seriously and at that point of hour also was available to monitor inspite of not being in hospital. \nShe not only helped me deliver my baby but also prepared me for post pregnancy strength required.\n",

Each trimester was a new challenge for me which doctor Meeta resolved very well. During third trimester, water level went down and baby weight was not increasing. I was very much in anxiety and tension. Doctor Meeta helped me to overcome these challenges. She suggested me diet chart and I followed it regularly. Finally a day had come and it was Sunday. In the second half of the day, I went to pain. She suggested to go to hospital and approach duty doctors. Based on her instructions, they suggested for emergency c-section. She arrived on-time and did surgery and finally we had our second baby in this world. My journey with doctor Meeta was good and I would like to recommend her.",

Since 2nd month pregnancy to post delivery consultation we went with Dr. Meeta & we didn't had any second thought of changing the doctor. *** ** ************* * encourages normal delivery, friendly, she kept us informed & explained about all the issues which my wife was facing during her pregnancy. Because of her we decided to do our delivery also in Cloudnine Whitefield & we were happy about our decision. Dr. Meeta was accurate about her findings refering scan reports, she once said to take scans from cloudnine itself which would help her to understand readings properly as some lab would follow different standards (for readings). Finally we were blessed with a healthy & cute baby girl on 30th March 2019, which was carried out by Dr. Meeta. I would recommend my family & friends about her service :)",

I was admitted in hospital one week before my expected date of delivery due to water break. It was about  8 in the night and whole night she was checking my reports and baby's heartbeat.

I went hesitantly to meet her as it was almost last minute of my pregnancy. On the first visit I realized that she is the one whom I have been looking for.She examined all my previous reports and cleared all my doubts and fear. She is so confident and energetic that seeing her I gain my confidence.She doesn't prescribe unnecessary test or medicine and listens to the patient with patience. I delivered a healthy baby girl on 11 Feb by c section. Post delivery, she recomended for home remedies when i complained about piles.I would highly recommend her.Thank you Dr Meeta for your guidance throughout this tough journey.",

Dr meeta prescribed me with metformin and asked me to be on a diet where I can really control my sugars.. it was tough to hold on my cravings but because of her motivation I was able to do so.. she's well experienced too.

Best of all, she treats every patient as a fresh one, her enthusiasm, her tone pitch, her interest inspires us. Though I had problem in my 5th and 7th month she directed my path so very well. She is never late to the given appointment, never rushed during consultation, she elaborates and explains things so well and \nduring any emergency she answers our call or even replies  to our concern. Best part is she never puts food restrictions(except unhealthy), never advise unnecessary medication. My due date was 21st jan 2019, however i had dilated on 5th jan, even without 9th month scan doctor ended up mine with a normal delivery; though i was in Labour for 13hrs, she never worried of time nor had a 2nd thought of c section. I delivered a healthy baby boy on 6th jan 2019. \nMe and my husband are really grateful to her. Thank you Meetha Ma'am!",

She forced me to exercise regularly and  to eat healthy . The best thing I liked about her is that she focuses on home remedies. she never prescribed any cream or medicine rather insisted on healthy diet and regular exercise. she  prescribed scans, tests and medicine only when required. I am indeed lucky that I visited her and delivered a beautiful baby girl under her. *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* ** **** **** ***** ***Thank you Dr Meeta for all your guidance and support that made our journey a truely memorable and cherisable one.",

She explains everything neatly and answers all queries with patience. She motivated me a lot to continue working as long as I could and informed me about all the necessary precautions to be taken.\n\nShe does not believe in prescribing lots of medication. She used to always suggest me DIY solutions to common issues which were really effective.\n\nI had to undergo an emergency C-section and she handled the process really well. She counselled me before the procedure and guided me throughout the experience.\n\nI am thoroughly satisfied with my interaction with her through out. A lot of my friends have started consulting her as well.",

She always cleared all our doubts and answered our questions with patience and without any hurry. She always encouraged me for a normal delivery whenever we visited her and gave us advise for the same but because of some complications I had to undergo a c-section. Even though it was early morning when we had an emergency and went to the hospital, Dr Meeta was there without any fail and the surgery went well. We are happily blessed with a baby girl. I will recommend her to all my friends which I am already doing. Thank you so much!",

I was very scared that something might go wrong but everytime I met her, all my tensed nerves calmed down. ** ***** ***** ********* *********** ********* ** ***** *** always suggests natural remedies as the first treatment. She answered all my queries with patience, no matter how silly they were. I had a low lying placenta and was always worried, but Dr Meeta would sense the worries in every check up and instill positivity in me and my husband. I would recommend her to every woman who wants to be in good hands during pregnancy. She definitely makes you feel safe and never forces for anything that one is not comfortable with. Doctor definitely connects very well with her patients and this is what every patient aspires for during the pregnancy journey. Thank you so much doctor for taking good care of us and helping my family to meet our baby girl. ",

Overall it was not normal. \nBut the way she motivates you to keep doing the efforts, the treatment she provided, it helped me alot. My baby was born with a good health and weight . I am also fine after the operation. \nPersonally, she makes me feel like a elder sister who will motivate you and push you for making the effort.  You will have the problem but she will make you feel like you can easily go through it. She will always say a line \" are kuch nhi h, Aaram se ghr jao\" \u263a she is highly proffesional with her work specially the \"OT\". The way she deals either with her team in OT or the patient, it is appreciable. Even if you go to the hospital in emergency or you didn't get to meet her, junior doctor will treat you and she will have all the information about your health even without meeting you. \nA funny thing I want to share, \"I ordered Idli for breakfast when I was admitted,  but I got upma\" I asked the canteen, they said, the doctor has said so...  Cause I need to give a sugar test\" \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude05\nWhat I mean is, u will be taken care in every way \ud83d\ude0a",

I was blessed with a baby girl on 13th March through normal delivery under the guidance and treatment of Meeta Mam. During this pandemic, I conceived when I was in my home town but after 2 trimester I had to come to Bangalore due to my husband's office situation. We were worried as how we will take care of my pregnancy during my third trimester as it is the most important time of the pregnancy. We started taking her consultation from 5th month onwards and we made the right decision to go to Meeta Mam for  as she not only helped in increasing my baby weight from  1.9 kg at 28 weeks to 2.9 kg at 37 weeks but also helped me in reducing my weight. Initially , I was worried as I was not sure whether I would be able to go through normal delivery due to my over weight (30 kgs more than usual expected weight ) but Meeta Mam helped me to push for normal delivery . Me and my family are so very thankful to her for making my pregnancy journey so smooth and memorable .What I like best about her that she never prescribe too many medicines . She played a role of game changer in my pregnancy. She is now my go to gynac and obgyn.",

It was my first pregnancy and I was very nervous and anxious with lot of questions. She always answered my queries with patience. She is a doctor who does not even ask you to follow latest practice but also tells you to follow your Mom's practise as well because she believes those generations were really strong enough to deliver a baby without any medical facilities. She always guided me that take learnings from your Mom as they are always right. Till 2nd trimester my pregnancy journey was smooth but in the 3rd trimester I had faced lot of complications. I got BP issue, Liver issue, started bleeding while passing urine etc.Since I had high BP issue normal delivery was impossible for me but Dr. Meeta consoled me saying that we will try for normal delivery till the end so don't take tension and think positive.With God grace and positive attitude of Dr. Meeta I had normal delivery and blessed with an angel.We both are doing good now. We always remain thankful to Dr. Meeta for always motivating me through out my pregnancy journey. She consulted me like a mentor.Thank you so much Dr. Meeta for everything. I would always recommend Dr. Meeta for consultation.Stays blessed and Happy Dr. Meeta.",

My family wanted nothing but the best for me through my journey of pregnancy, Dr. Meeta Chawhan was my 3rd doctor from the time I was pregnant, I had to change the doctors as I wasn\u2019t happy with them. After I met Dr. Meeta Chawhan I didn\u2019t have to change any further. I met her when I was 6 months in my pregnancy and finally felt happy and confident. She is quite friendly and advised utmost care through the remaining months of my pregnancy. She ensured I planned for my delivery from 34th week onwards itself, which was the most important part of my journey since I had no clue when and what is needed. I delive d when I was ok the 37th week l, I was rushed to the hospital at dawn, Unfortunately I had to go thru C-section and was super scared, but I knew under Dr. Meeta Chawhan I need not worry much , I delivered a beautiful baby without any issues and happily taken care of during my stay in the hospital. Thank you Dr. Meeta Chawhan for assuring a smooth journey. I recommend her to the ladies who need attention and care.",

The doctor is generally two to three hours late in following up with patients due to OT and other emergencies, but the Hospital doesn't care to inform patients beforehand about the delay.2. For even small queries, you will have to wait in queue again. Like if you went to do some test in the hospital premise you won't be able to show result/ quick consult with the Doctor without waiting.3. There is even followUp charge (half of the consultation fee during the first 6 days after consultation) for small queries that Doctor prescribes if you don't followUp on the same day. Even if you want to followup on the same day, the Doctor is not going to have a free slot.4. They don't provide Doctor's or any proper personnel emergency contact so you are just stuck since reaching her is insanely frustrating. 5. The fees is 1000 (850 cons.   150 reg.) oppose to what is mentioned on Practo.** ** ***** **** *** **** **** ** * ********** ******** ***** *** **** ** **** *** ***** *** *** ********** ** * **** **** *********** If you have all the time in the world to throw away and is very calm and patient person, you can think of booking appointment here.

About drs.then I found good feedback about Dr.Meeta Chawhan and I decided to see her after confirming pregnancy for follow up and delivery.and I am so greatful for my decision to choose her.\n I was already over weight when conceived so during my first consultation she explained her plan to achieve healthy pregnancy and childbirth, during each visit first thing she would do is to listen patiently all the complains I had in time and then she gives all possible solution which were most of natural and home remedies, also she used to encourage for healthy lifestyle during the time which can help me post delivery \nEven how much rush or emergency cases are there,she always with same energy and positivity which made me so comfortable and confident day by day towards delivery\nOne thing I most appropriate about Dr. Meeta is she is Frank enough to share and explains about complications or difficulties during follow ups which actually prepare us mentally to face the situation if unfortunately occur,\nI have gained overall 10kg weight and reduced almost same within 2weeks post delivery after following her diet suggestions and delivered healthy baby girl at week39\n",

Finally our search finish and we met with Dr. Meeta Chauhan. She explained all the procedures clearly and cleared any of the doubts we had. One good thing in her, she is not preferring unnecessary medicine during pregnancy. That is really awesome, because many doctors are scaring to patients and running multiple medicine. Which is not required. She is giving enough time during OPD. As we proceeded with the pregnancy , her confidence gave us confidence as well. She is very positive and straight forward with her patients. Due to Rheumatoid arthritis and low lying placenta, we have not tried normal delivery but she had insisted us for that. And she never happy if someone is not going for normal delivery that is very rare in current era. When doctors are doing treatment as per hospital direction. If you are in Bangalore and pregnant. Please meet Dr. Meeta Chauhan once. You will see the difference. Thank you so much Dr. Meeta Chauhan for your guidance during pregnancy. It was really great journey with you. Kudos to the Doctor.",

When the time came, she saved the day and made timely decision to deliver the baby via C section because fetal movements had reduced a lot.

Until last week of my pregnancy she emphasized for a normal delivery however I had to go for C-section operation as I did not go into labor until week 40. I was so scared of surgery but my operation went really smooth. Glad that I consulted her for my pregnancy.",

Initially I had approached another doctor who came out to be an infertility specialist. So he then referred me to Dr Meeta. Since then I got to know her and have been seeing her throughout my pregnancy, delivery and also post delivery care. It was my first pregnancy and since I had health issues as well which made my pregnancy a bit complicated, but she handled everything with utmost care and ease. She had always been to the point and explain everything in-depth. I used to bombard her with so many questions, some of which were even so silly, but still she used to answer each of them with full patience, which made me feel so comfortable and doubt free. she is a doctor who encourages for normal delivery which is rarely seen in doctors nowadays. inspire of my complications, she tried till the last month of pregnancy to see if I can have a normal delivery, but somehow it didn't happen because of my complications and Ceasarean delivery was the only option, but no regrets as it was only for my and my baby's wellbeing. she is also a very cordial person who always wears a friendly smile of her face, which infact takes away a lot of fear from us. I feel blessed to be in the hands of her for my childbirth. also I recovered very soon after delivery. hence I would strongly recommend her for every woman who needs special medical care.",

Later we came to know that the doctor was going on leave for a week which was not informed to us earlier therefore we presume the advise was intentional. We opted for normal delivery hence artificial pain was induced. Due to lot of pain we were skeptical whether to go for c section. Never did the doctor encouraged to try. Her advise during the labour period was also baised towards opting for  a c section. I believe if she wud have motivated once we could have gathered courage and strength for normal as I was 7.5 cm dilated.

Dr. Meeta was the driving force who not only used to make me feel comfortable but also listened to all my queries very patiently. She gave great tips to deal with the prenatal problems.The best part is that she recommends very less medicines and always recommends home remedies.She encouraged me to be active throughout my pregnancy which eventually helped me to recover on time post delivery .Always takes care of your concern patiently,assures me for normal delivery,i was also ready for that.But due to some complication i decided to go for C section.During the operation also she was talking to me and making me comfortable and was giving moral support.I had a healthy baby boy delivered by Dr. Meeta on 18th May,2018.A big big thanks to Dr. Meeta for bringing our bundle of joy in this world.",

She never gave us false assurances but at the same time we always felt positive after meeting her and that i think is most important quality of a doctor (being realistic and motivating at the same time) especially when you are in a complex situation and you look for an expert guidance. Her treatment and assessment was perfect for me and i am very happy that i found her and she could handle my case. Infact her way of explanation and guidance is so good that i now know how to easily control my blood glucose level by balancing the proportions. An absolute go to person for any pregnancy issues.

For all of these issues meeta mam suggested only natural methods like food exercise and water and I delivered a healthy baby boy.  More than anything I was confident that I was in the safest hands.

Dr. Meeta suggested me to get the fibroid removed through a surgery although I was too afraid because of the word surgery still ma'am explained me the issues and the procedures so well that I decided to take upon the surgery. It was a Laproscopic surgery and now it's been almost a month of my surgery n I'm back to my normal life. Without any complications and painless period.I'm really glad I met Dr. Meeta for my surgery every thing went so smooth. She is a real gem to our health sector....",

She always responded to my messages when i had concerns. Though I had aimed for normal delivery and Dr tried her best for normal but due to emergency situation had to undergo LSCS. Though I was very scared, she stayed positive, was very kind and comforting during my labour and delivery process and I blindly trusted and believed in her.

She gives enough time to explain each report, future plans, even during video consultations. She does not prescribe lot of medicines, rather she believes in home remedies most of the time. In 4th November, 2020 we were blessed with a baby girl. Thanks to Dr. Meeta Chawhan for her knowledge and experience in handling pregnancy, having positivity and keeping her patients confident. I would highly recommend Dr. Meeta Chawhan.",

Also she won't prescribed too many medicines and even if there is any complications, she won't let you be in stress.

She is great in terms of giving only required medicine and also always suggest home remedies so that it does not have any side effect on both mother & baby. From our third month scan - baby's weight was fine but the predication was always on negative side (possibility of not having proper weight) hence we were little tensed but with Dr Meeta counselling support and adequate treatment all was fine at the end. During last scan, we found that once round of loop (umbilical cord) was around baby's neck but despite of that Doctor suggested for attempting normal delivery and assured us that she will take all the precaution and if needed then only switch to c-section. by god's and her grace, we were blessed with a healthy baby boy on 28th Feb 2020 via normal delivery. Thanks a lot Doctor and may god bless you with all the happiness.   ",

I went into an emergency situation just after completing 37 weeks, and even though Dr. Meeta was on leave that day, she responded to my call and attended my case by reaching the hospital on time. Her presence itself in OT made me so comfortable. Its only because of her proper guidance I could deliver our baby girl at the right time. Strongly recommend her for any kind of pregnancy.",

She is an extremely talented gynaecologist who picks up every minute detail of the report/scans and explain this to her patients. Her way of treating is very natural and she recommends to eat healthy diet than prescribing market supplements. Throughout my pregnancy, I had to take no additional medication (for which I was very happy) and the result was a healthy, normal delivery. During the last trimester, I had high fever due to which there were some signals in the report which Dr. Meeta picked up very quickly and again suggested natural way of dealing with these. It's very rare and great to have doctor like Meeta Chawhan who believes that health lies in our own kitchen and is very transparent and friendly to her patients. Her positivity and energy levels give real confidence to the patients and we are very happy to have found a gynaec like her. Thanks a lot, Dr. Meeta!",

Even for a small clarification my wife had like any other first time pregnant women would have, Dr used to spend more time to help us understand the root cause and how we could easily overcome it. She is straight forward about any criticality and tells you upfront, you will be prepared to face that mentally. One of the best doctors in Cloudnine at white-field.\n\nI recommend Dr. Meeta to those who does not google post discussion, who sticks to the routine laid by Dr. She will guide you to experience happy and successful normal delivery.",

I used to ask her if labor starts at night what will happen ? will you come ? and she used to reply with a big smile you don't worry i will be there. In pregnancy its very important to have a doctor whom you can trust. i delivered a baby boy on 12th of August 2019. From day one till now i have had the best experience with her and would like to recommend her to all. \nA big Thank you to *** **** Doctor.. :)",

I was well treated by her with the issue of low weight of the baby and low amniotic fluid level. She does not prescribe unnecessary medication and always ask to go with home remedies. There was an issue with the baby\u2019s low weight so she was clear and prepared us that it can either be a normal or c-section. I am so grateful to her for all her support and care during my pregnancy. Huge thanks to her for bringing my little one into this world. I strongly recommend her.",

We went to her for second pregnancy she takes time to make you things understand n gives you confidence. I was diagnosed with diabetes n low hemoglobin at the last trimester but under her guidance n diet recommendation everything went well. She patiently listens the problem and gives you solutions which are easy .  At the time of delivery initially we are ok to have csection at around 10 in morning but my contractions begun at the night only so they have to take me to the OT at early morning and I was afraid whether Meeta mam will be there or not but she made her available at last moment and everything went fine after she came. Also after operation she gives lot of confidence and make me believe to start normal things like walking, eating etc. She was there at all the moment of the journey. Thanks a lot for her care n guidance.",

Best thing was that i never felt stressed and enjoyed my whole pregnancy.. And for this no doubt Dr. Meeta was one of the main reason as she always used to say to enjoy the pregnancy and be positive. She always used to suggest home remedies for most of the issues which i faced during pregnancy like urine infection, constipation etc. She  stressed on eating healthy and on remaining active during pregnancy. I was doing my office work till my delivery day.Also,  she listens to ur doubts and clarify them properly. I have suggested my friends also to consult her if they are entering the beautiful phase of pregnancy. Thank u so much Dr. Meeta :) ",

She always suggested natural things to overcome any issues and trust me it worked really well. I would recommend her to everyone who is looking for a doctor. Regards, Ayswarya & Saswat",
