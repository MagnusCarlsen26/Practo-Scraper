He was very honest with the recommendations he made. We decided to go with doctor and he handled my wife's wisdom tooth surgery like a charm. No nerve damage or infections. She was able eat normally after 2 days.The prices are very reasonable compared to other clinics. We would definitely visit him again \ud83d\ude0a",

All the sittings went smoothly without any hassle and it was always on time. The clinic is also good. There were no hidden charges and the doctor charged 2500 for each Treatment. I had a comfortable experience and there was hardly any pain during all the procedures. Thank you Dr. and Thank you Practo.",
