From the first day itself, his friendliness, knowledge and the ease with which the doctor works impressed me. He is not an amateur! Anyone with basic biology knowledge can figure it out. He is really good at what he does. 

I came for a complicated case of wisdoms tooth extraction. My lower jaw was cracked and swollen by another dentist but Dr Yogesh assured me nothing such should ever or will happen. My tooth crown was crooked and hence, a surgery had to be performed. I was scared to death but the surgery went on smoothly with zero complications! 

Next I went for clear aligners which took 1 year to get my smile corrected. I have completed the course with utmost satisfaction. My sister and husband also go to him. Dr Yogesh is literally our family doctor and would definitely recommend Him without any question.

This is not a paid review but a testimony of my dental woes addressed right especially after having such bad experiences with the other dentists! This is the reason I’m extremely happy with Dr Yogi because he kinda changed my perception about dentists.
