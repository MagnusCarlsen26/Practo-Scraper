It's been 3 days since I've been on her treatment and I already feel much better. She is also very considerate about all your follow up questions and concerns. I genuinely thank Practo for connecting me to such an amazing dentist who I'm sure I wouldn't have found if not for this platform.

But despite consultation Practo app shows the consultation as it never happened and has also refunded my consultation fee.
