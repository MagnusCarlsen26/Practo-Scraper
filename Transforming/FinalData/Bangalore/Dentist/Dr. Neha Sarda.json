Their patience helped him remain calm throughout the procedures. \n\nThanks to this procedure he is finally able to eat solid food after a year and this has helped his overall recovery. \n\nWe are very grateful to Dr Neha, Dr Srihari and Dr Fawad and it is due to their skills, knowledge and the efforts they went to above and beyond (including coming home when my father could not travel) that makes medicine such a noble profession. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr Neha and her colleagues.

Patient is a senior citizen and she suggested things that we should do to avoid any damage in future because of old age and asked us to be proactive. That was quite useful in terms of planning.

Their patience helped him remain calm throughout the procedures. \n\nThanks to this procedure he is finally able to eat solid food after a year and this has helped his overall recovery. \n\nWe are very grateful to Dr Neha, Dr Srihari and Dr Fawad and it is due to their skills, knowledge and the efforts they went to above and beyond (including coming home when my father could not travel) that makes medicine such a noble profession. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr Neha and her colleagues.

I being a senior citizen got very much comfortable with her and in small discussion she got my full confidence. I got fearless and requested her to treat every problem. She didn't insist for any treatment. First she asked me for filling in two teeth. I got painless treatment. During second visit she checked if Root canal treatment is required as was suggested by previous dentist. She came to the conclusion of filling only by composite materials. Only required painless treatment she did at very reasonable charges. Extremely brilliant in her job. ",
