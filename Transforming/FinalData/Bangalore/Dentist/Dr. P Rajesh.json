I had undergone several treatments for my misalignment in teeth since 2012 at places like RV Dental College but I was never satisfied with the kind of service that was provided there, came to my rescue was one and only Dr. Rajesh who very well explained the underlying cause behind the misalignment and how it could be dealt with in the most painless process. Dr. Rajesh and Dr. Sindhu both were very patient with me and spent a lot of time trying to calm me down and making me understand how they would definitely deliver whatever was promised, that gave me so much confidence in myself and both the Drs. The staff  on the other hand was also very helpful and kind and always available to help whether it was a festive time, a holiday, I always used to get prior updates. I am more than satisfied with what was promised to me. Dr. Rajesh is very professional, he takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice , It's not easy to find a good dentist in todays time, I highly recommend Dr. Rajesh and Dr. Sindhu for any of your tooth ailments.",

I had undergone several treatments for my misalignment in teeth since 2012 at places like RV Dental College but I was never satisfied with the kind of service that was provided there, came to my rescue was one and only Dr. Rajesh who very well explained the underlying cause behind the misalignment and how it could be dealt with in the most painless process. Dr. Rajesh and Dr. Sindhu both were very patient with me and spent a lot of time trying to calm me down and making me understand how they would definitely deliver whatever was promised, that gave me so much confidence in myself and both the Drs. The staff  on the other hand was also very helpful and kind and always available to help whether it was a festive time, a holiday, I always used to get prior updates. I am more than satisfied with what was promised to me. Dr. Rajesh is very professional, he takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice , It's not easy to find a good dentist in todays time, I highly recommend Dr. Rajesh and Dr. Sindhu for any of your tooth ailments.",
