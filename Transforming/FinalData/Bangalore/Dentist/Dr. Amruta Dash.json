I am delighted by the entire process and outcome of my treatment.\nThey thoroughly diagnosed and recommended necessary treatments and made sure I understood every step involved. And both the doctors had a perfect coordination in the treatment plan. Considering the usual discomfort in dental procedures, my experience was surprisingly comfortable. Timeline of the treatment was also communicated beforehand and things were on track. The support staff and scheduling of consultation is very good so I never had to wait overtime. The treatments were not be the most affordable considering the complexity, but they are definitely fair valued given the quality and expertise provided.",

                "review_text": "Teeth related issues always are scary and need to handled with utmost care,  thus choosing a right dentist is an uphill climb.. I would just say that i got lucky to meet Dr. Amruta, when she used to work in a different clinic before she opened Ivory Smiles. I have ever since then, been hooked to her for anything (small / big) related to teeth :).. not just me but my whole family - my parents, my husband and now my daughter & my friends. When you meet her aswell, you just know you have come to the right place!! Always a smile on her face and not to forget, she ensures all in her clinic treat patients with a lot of respect.\n\nA few reasons why we all go back to Ivory Smiles and would choose to that even if we have travel a great deal of distance: \n\n1. First & foremost, Dr. Amruta and her team - extremely knowledgeable and great at their skill!\n2. Politeness of her staff and all in the clinic. Treat you with great care and respect.\n3. Hygiene & cleanliness at a 100% satisfaction level. Proper sanitization always.. \n4. Instruments & machines used for treatments are visibly high quality and thus the fees they charged is extremely reasonable for what you get in return!\n5. Best quality Implants (no compromise whatsoever on quality)\n6. High on Ethics & completely Transparent, starting from the word 'GO'.. you will not have to ask and if you do, they will patiently provide you all answers to all your questions.\n\nA major reason for my confidence and blind faith on her - almost a decade back, had visited a known dentist for getting my teeth evaluated and the doctor got me super worried by saying i had 8 cavities which needed immediate remediation to avoid further decay...that's when i went for a second opinion, where I met Dr. Amruta and the rest is history... She thoroughly checked, and told me there were none.. its been almost 10 years and its now that ive undergone a filling for 1 tooth.. again painless treatment..my parents & my husband have gone through multiple RCTs and implants and all treatments have been to a 100% satisfaction...\n\nThank you soo much Dr. Amruta and team for doing such an amazing job!!",

She will take the time to understand your case, is sensitive to your needs & succinctly explains the process. She has a great bedside manner and ensures you are comfortable during any procedures you may get.\n\nMy treatment:\nI have a congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisor. Prior to my treatment here I used to wear an RPD (denture). I had to visit this clinic because after several years of using the denture, it had broken - and I wanted to get a more permanent solution, a dental implant. After a couple of visits and scans (CBCT, etc) Dr. Amruta drew out a complete plan for me which involved some ortho, some laser surgery & finally a dental implant.\nIn other clinics I visited, they had similar plans but usually would only tackle the one problem (missing tooth). At Ivory Smiles, Dr. Amruta takes the time to make sure you feel good about your entire smile & she's very particular about the overall appearance of the teeth and her treatment plans are aligned with that (within reason).\nWe did not opt for Invisalign because it was a short treatment period & simple movements.\nMy ortho treatment was carried out for a period of 4-6 months by Dr. Anitha, the visiting orthodontist at the time, who is also really amazing. I was given a temporary bridge in that duration.\nPost the ortho, the dental implant surgery itself was carried out very smoothly as this is Dr. Amruta's area of expertise - pain management was amazing & she talked me through the entire process. There were some minor gum correction laser treatments as well.\n\n--\n\nI am extremely happy with the final result of my treatment and my smile. Teeth are such an important part of your life which you don't realize how problematic their condition is until you see their effect on your life after they have undergone the right treatment.\nIn terms of pricing, I would say it is not the cheapest - but since this is a premium clinic you definitely get what you pay for.\n\nOverall, to re-iterate I would unquestionably recommend anyone to choose Ivory Smiles! :)",

I met Dr Amruta and after my initial consultation i was sure about the decision I made to visit her. She listened to all my needs and I had very less time in hand to get all my treatments sorted. She suggested invisalign treatment to get my teeth aligned as I had very bunched up teeth and then we did a couple of dental implants nobel biocare and veneers.now I have a smile that I longed for all my life.Dr Prahalad was my invisalign specialist and both Dr Prahalad and Dr Amruta took so much of keen interest In my smile.they follow the word perfection to the T.never  thought so so much advancement exists in dentistry**** ** **** *************** Dr Amruta  also makes sure that all her patients (I have seen her treating other patients too) are comfortable and treatments are as painless as possible.Now I have moved away from Bangalore and I visit her every time I visit Bangalore. She always accommodates her schedule for me(trust me she is busy   but does not make us wait a bit).she has become like a friend now and I thank her for the beautiful smile she has given me. Do visit her and Dr prahalad for any smile correction issues",

Background music was really awesome!!\nFinally I\u2019m happy with the result and now I can eat both the sides of  my teeth as earlier !!\nFinal thing to say, we are in a world as most of the doctors wash their hand after treatment ,But Dr.Amruta is totally different from others and she was very happy after seeing my improvements in Gum after her treatment.That was really impressive.\nUnquestionably,,I\u2019ll recommend to everyone *** ** ********* *** * **** ******* ***As you explained I will soon visit Ivory smiles for Teeth alignment!!\nOver all im very happy and great thanks to you Mam to make me to come out from my Gum disease !!",

I have  been suffering with a gun disease due to which I have lost most of my teeth. My kids really convinced me to see a dentist but all the dentists I went to did not have a good solution. Some would say use dentures which I did not want for hygiene reasons and the rest told me to go for dental implants.  I knew this treatment would need special care and attention. Hence I started looking out for a good dentist. \nI met Dr Amruta almost 7 months ago and consulted her. Initially I was a little scared but in 45 mins of a conversation with her,i walked out of the room satisfied.  She is brilliant and answers all my questions with facts and patience. What I liked was the way she handles every patient. She is soft spoken and very good at her work. She told me I would need some scans and her receptionist helped me reach out for my cbct.\nNext day I met her and she gave me a detailed plan. She had so much clarity which no other dentist could give me. She charted out a diet plan as I had difficulty in eating with few teeth.  We started out treatments soon and within 4 months I had a complete set of teeth. I got 8 implants placed and  I remember her saying,its my responsibility to make sure you get a healthy set of teeth. Most dentists wash their hands out of a patient after they get they money. But she is not at all like that.  I have been visiting her for all my check up and not once has she rushed or made me feel less important.God bless this soul and I would pray she helps more people like this and collect her blessings.  \nSmall note on the team of assistants- clean brilliant and efficient.they treat you like family.  Always smiling and will never say no. You can see for yourself if you visit them.  I would rate them 20/10 if I could. Thank you. \n",

Dr. Amrita and Dr. Vivek were both fantastic - their recommendations, timelines, professionalism and expertise were top notch. In fact when I found out that I had to move abroad on a short notice,  they expedited my timelines for the orthodontic procedures from 1 year to 6 months! Changed their approach quickly, performed the relevant procedures for the same and even though I was skeptical initially since moving teeth is a slow process I was just amazed at the results in the end. And post the brace work, I had veneers applied which have just been perfect, Dr. Amruta was super efficient and all her recommendations were spot on. I would highly recommend Dr. Amruta for all dental problems. She's very pragmatic and honest, so you will definitely not be misled but get the best possible solutions for your problems.",

And both the doctors had a perfect coordination in the treatment plan. Considering the usual discomfort in dental procedures, my experience was surprisingly comfortable. Timeline of the treatment was also communicated beforehand and things were on track. The support staff and scheduling of consultation is very good so I never had to wait overtime. The treatments were not be the most affordable considering the complexity, but they are definitely fair valued given the quality and expertise provided.",

                "review_text": "Teeth related issues always are scary and need to handled with utmost care,  thus choosing a right dentist is an uphill climb.. I would just say that i got lucky to meet Dr. Amruta, when she used to work in a different clinic before she opened Ivory Smiles. I have ever since then, been hooked to her for anything (small / big) related to teeth :).. not just me but my whole family - my parents, my husband and now my daughter & my friends. When you meet her aswell, you just know you have come to the right place!! Always a smile on her face and not to forget, she ensures all in her clinic treat patients with a lot of respect.\n\nA few reasons why we all go back to Ivory Smiles and would choose to that even if we have travel a great deal of distance: \n\n1. First & foremost, Dr. Amruta and her team - extremely knowledgeable and great at their skill!\n2. Politeness of her staff and all in the clinic. Treat you with great care and respect.\n3. Hygiene & cleanliness at a 100% satisfaction level. Proper sanitization always.. \n4. Instruments & machines used for treatments are visibly high quality and thus the fees they charged is extremely reasonable for what you get in return!\n5. Best quality Implants (no compromise whatsoever on quality)\n6. High on Ethics & completely Transparent, starting from the word 'GO'.. you will not have to ask and if you do, they will patiently provide you all answers to all your questions.\n\nA major reason for my confidence and blind faith on her - almost a decade back, had visited a known dentist for getting my teeth evaluated and the doctor got me super worried by saying i had 8 cavities which needed immediate remediation to avoid further decay...that's when i went for a second opinion, where I met Dr. Amruta and the rest is history... She thoroughly checked, and told me there were none.. its been almost 10 years and its now that ive undergone a filling for 1 tooth.. again painless treatment..my parents & my husband have gone through multiple RCTs and implants and all treatments have been to a 100% satisfaction...\n\nThank you soo much Dr. Amruta and team for doing such an amazing job!!",

She will take the time to understand your case, is sensitive to your needs & succinctly explains the process. She has a great bedside manner and ensures you are comfortable during any procedures you may get.\n\nMy treatment:\nI have a congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisor. Prior to my treatment here I used to wear an RPD (denture). I had to visit this clinic because after several years of using the denture, it had broken - and I wanted to get a more permanent solution, a dental implant. After a couple of visits and scans (CBCT, etc) Dr. Amruta drew out a complete plan for me which involved some ortho, some laser surgery & finally a dental implant.\nIn other clinics I visited, they had similar plans but usually would only tackle the one problem (missing tooth). At Ivory Smiles, Dr. Amruta takes the time to make sure you feel good about your entire smile & she's very particular about the overall appearance of the teeth and her treatment plans are aligned with that (within reason).\nWe did not opt for Invisalign because it was a short treatment period & simple movements.\nMy ortho treatment was carried out for a period of 4-6 months by Dr. Anitha, the visiting orthodontist at the time, who is also really amazing. I was given a temporary bridge in that duration.\nPost the ortho, the dental implant surgery itself was carried out very smoothly as this is Dr. Amruta's area of expertise - pain management was amazing & she talked me through the entire process. There were some minor gum correction laser treatments as well.\n\n--\n\nI am extremely happy with the final result of my treatment and my smile. Teeth are such an important part of your life which you don't realize how problematic their condition is until you see their effect on your life after they have undergone the right treatment.\nIn terms of pricing, I would say it is not the cheapest - but since this is a premium clinic you definitely get what you pay for.\n\nOverall, to re-iterate I would unquestionably recommend anyone to choose Ivory Smiles! :)",

I met Dr Amruta and after my initial consultation i was sure about the decision I made to visit her. She listened to all my needs and I had very less time in hand to get all my treatments sorted. She suggested invisalign treatment to get my teeth aligned as I had very bunched up teeth and then we did a couple of dental implants nobel biocare and veneers.now I have a smile that I longed for all my life.Dr Prahalad was my invisalign specialist and both Dr Prahalad and Dr Amruta took so much of keen interest In my smile.they follow the word perfection to the T.never  thought so so much advancement exists in dentistry**** ** **** *************** Dr Amruta  also makes sure that all her patients (I have seen her treating other patients too) are comfortable and treatments are as painless as possible.Now I have moved away from Bangalore and I visit her every time I visit Bangalore. She always accommodates her schedule for me(trust me she is busy   but does not make us wait a bit).she has become like a friend now and I thank her for the beautiful smile she has given me. Do visit her and Dr prahalad for any smile correction issues",

I have  been suffering with a gun disease due to which I have lost most of my teeth. My kids really convinced me to see a dentist but all the dentists I went to did not have a good solution. Some would say use dentures which I did not want for hygiene reasons and the rest told me to go for dental implants.  I knew this treatment would need special care and attention. Hence I started looking out for a good dentist. \nI met Dr Amruta almost 7 months ago and consulted her. Initially I was a little scared but in 45 mins of a conversation with her,i walked out of the room satisfied.  She is brilliant and answers all my questions with facts and patience. What I liked was the way she handles every patient. She is soft spoken and very good at her work. She told me I would need some scans and her receptionist helped me reach out for my cbct.\nNext day I met her and she gave me a detailed plan. She had so much clarity which no other dentist could give me. She charted out a diet plan as I had difficulty in eating with few teeth.  We started out treatments soon and within 4 months I had a complete set of teeth. I got 8 implants placed and  I remember her saying,its my responsibility to make sure you get a healthy set of teeth. Most dentists wash their hands out of a patient after they get they money. But she is not at all like that.  I have been visiting her for all my check up and not once has she rushed or made me feel less important.God bless this soul and I would pray she helps more people like this and collect her blessings.  \nSmall note on the team of assistants- clean brilliant and efficient.they treat you like family.  Always smiling and will never say no. You can see for yourself if you visit them.  I would rate them 20/10 if I could. Thank you. \n",

I got Invisalign from Dr Raba and after getting my bite and alignent corrected I got venners done by Dr Amruta. The treatments were planned very nicely and i must say the communication is crystal clear with all doctors. They have excellant materials and I got fillings done and they lasted very well. Thank you to Dr Amruta for all the dental work. Highly highly recommend ",

Dr. Amrita and Dr. Vivek were both fantastic - their recommendations, timelines, professionalism and expertise were top notch. In fact when I found out that I had to move abroad on a short notice,  they expedited my timelines for the orthodontic procedures from 1 year to 6 months! Changed their approach quickly, performed the relevant procedures for the same and even though I was skeptical initially since moving teeth is a slow process I was just amazed at the results in the end. And post the brace work, I had veneers applied which have just been perfect, Dr. Amruta was super efficient and all her recommendations were spot on. I would highly recommend Dr. Amruta for all dental problems. She's very pragmatic and honest, so you will definitely not be misled but get the best possible solutions for your problems.",

Her diagnosis is impeccable and whatever she says feels so logical and scientific. I had tmj issue for many years and some missing teeeth. Been suffering since my jaws would get locked when I yawn. After showing to dentists in Delhi, Chandigarh n Chennai, I travelled to Bangalore to see her and she gave me the right diagnosis. I have completed my Invisalign with her and now I can feel the difference. No more clicking sounds and jaw pains since 2 yrs. My smile improved so much. So happy that I can live a comfortable pain free life now. Visit her and see the difference. Changes are not high but I feel rightly priced too. Not too low not too expensive. She clearly tells the pros n cons so we know money is well invested. Thank you Dr Amruta. I hope this review helps people make the right decision about choosing the best dentist.",

The prices might just be a few hundred rupees more but the clinic is clean and instruments come in clean packages so one is really assured that the hygiene is taken care of. I got couple of root canals done, crowns veneers and a deep clean for my bleeding gums. So happy with the services and big thanks to Dr Amruta ma\u2019am n her team. Dr Nandini also did a great job.

Her clinic is located in a prime place and very accessible to where we stay(Harlur road)I got to know about her from a friends in laws who have been taking her treatment for many years. I got 5 crowns done and 3 root canals. Also got extraction done of a very tough wisdom tooth by Dr Bipin who is the surgeon there. Dr Amruta\u2019s hand skills are very good and she swiftly works and you can see her calm n composed. Her assistants are so well trained that they know what she needs. That is how I know she is brilliant cos her support staff work like her. As patients we generally neglect dental health and we only visit when there is an issue. But she will tell you what needs immediate care and what treatment can wait. She is not behind money at all. She cares about quality of work. That is what we want from dentists right. Overall treatments are **** *** painless. Highly recommend her\u2026",

It turned out that the earlier root canal done by another dentist was treated only partially and the dormant infection was sealed only to flare up.\nDr. Amrutha explained it with the X-Ray images and the necessary procedure's to be taken to cure my pain. I found her to be extremely competent as is the  attention and care to her patients. Her interactions and communication displays professional efficiency a high sense of personal interest , and you are not just \"another patient\".  Like elsewhere, Root canal treatment is at a fixed cost, but unlike other places with fixed schedules/number of sittings, if it requires an extra sitting or extra observation, She will willingly accommodate it and not in a hurry to complete your treatment. I will highly recommend Dr. Amrutha/ Dr Jay of Ivory clinic , ** **** ****** ** *** **** ****** ****** ** *** **************** ",

I consulted Dr.Amrutha who made thorough assessment and diagnosed a condition called periodontitis. She explained that deep cleaning/surgical scaling is required in order to stop the infection completely. She presented me with 2 options: either opt for a normal deep cleansing or opt for a laser treatment known as the Inap procedure. I chose the latter as I felt it was more effective and less painful. Just as I assumed,the procedure was not painful at all and only took about 45 mins. It has been 15 days since I underwent the treatment. The bleeding has stopped completely, and I am extremely satisfied with the treatment.\n\nI will be updating this review after 2 months again with the final verdict. But all in all, a good experience.",

The entire vibe of the clinic is so comfortable. I had a feeling that a dentist visit involved pain and a lot of discomfort but my perspective changed after visiting Dr Amruta. I got my orthodontic treatment done by Dr Mathew and he is also a really good orthodontist. All my treatments were painless and the doctors give u all the instructions very clearly.

I was really touched with the amount of care she takes for all her patients. Treatment did not pain more than 1 day. I travel from another city to bangalore to get procedure done after reading her reviews and so happy now with the final result. Thank you to her entire team who are wonderful as well. ",

Initially I was very skeptical but after meeting her and after completion of my treatment I have full confidence on her and Ivorysmiles. I got 3 root canals and 4 crowns done. They plan the treatment very well which I think is lacking in most dentists. They give a complete picture of dental issues and what are the steps required. They are so clear in what they explain and treatment is also done according. I had really bad experiences with other dentists but after meeting her I have decided not to change my dentist for ever. She is very sweet humble and the people in her clinic are also very nice. Not behind money at all. ",

Dr. Amruta and her whole team is super friendly, understanding and very approachable. I am very happy with the results of my treatment and I strongly recommend Ivory Smiles Dental Clinic because when you are going for such a big change which will be there on your face for all your life, you need a doctor like Amruta. :)",

Dr Amruta is a great dentist and meticulously planned my implant surgery and performed it without much discomfort. It's been 3 months since I have received my crowns and I can see the change in my eating habits and speech. I visited a lot of dentists and here I found that they charge a little bit more say 2 percent more but it is for the quality of care they promise you. But the price is still lesser than some corporates I have seen where the doctors keep changing and they don't stick to the time. Would highly recommend Dr Amruta Dash for any implant procedure. She simplifies it and makes the process informative and keeps a keen eye on the entire process. Her team is excellent and the quality of instruments X rays and even injections are far more  better than most clinics.",
