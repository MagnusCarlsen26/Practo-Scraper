"Doctor friendliness,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I  went to Sure smile on 2nd Jan 2020. I have got my wisdom tooth extraction and root canal treatment. I went to Sure smile with lot of nervousness about the pain that i might get during treatment, but the doctor explained and spoke about treatment clearly, they also say before doing something to your tooth, like we might have little pain now, we get some numbness, we hear some sound now etc, so that we don't panic. I am very much depressed and not happy with the fact that i will loose 2 of my teeth, but somehow really happy the way they treated my tooth. I mean only pain is during giving injection, rest all will be fine, trust me, this doctor Vinod is good. Following doctor's instructions will help u to avoid any complications later.  The other staff are also good, supporting and helpful. I went 4 times in 15 days span for the treatment, Thought there is crowd few times, doctor stays calm and takes time to treat you , never felt he is in hurry!! That is really good !! 
I am very happy with the treatment, its been 15days now, so far so good. Hope everything will be fine later also. Of course its my decision to have a metal crown :( , i thought metal crown will not be harsh on its adjacent tooth, its just yesterday I got crown so may be i should get used to it. u can have ceramic crown if u can afford 2K more. I am still not sure which crown is best. 
Charges/Fees are also normal like any other dental clinic, not expensive or cheep.  
One suggestion is don't go for big chain hospitals for dental treatment even if can claim the treatment charges, no ones pay attention to your pain or what you say.

Allow me to elaborate on this issue.

1. Your appointment for 14 Dec sought by you online was rescheduled to 16th on 13th December itself with a personal call. It was due to an emergency and requires no explanation here. Surely that's very professional on our part.
2. Your appointment for 16th December was at 10am and you reached at sharp 12 noon. YOU DIDN'T EVEN MAKE A CALL TO INFORM US THAT YOU WERE RUNNING LATE. Appointments are NOT ON FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. Certainly you entered the clinic 2 minutes before the other patient. But the other patient was there ON TIME for her appointment which we have to honour. Also the receptionist asked you to wait for FIVE to TEN MINUTES so that the patient who walked in on time could be attended to first. EVEN ON PRACTO A WAIT PERIOD OF 15 MINUTES IS CLEARLY MENTIONED AT THE TIME OF BOOKING THE Appointment. Again that's extremely professional behaviour.

Despite that, we would have loved to accommodate you after those 5-10 minutes had you waited instead of storming out . We can only honour your appointment if you honour it yourself. Thank you.
