"Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Both doctor Subhash and doctor Priya are extremely professional and they had performed my root canal treatment without any complications. Earlier I had a bad experience where the pain during the root canal treatment was extremely unbearable but with doctor Subhash, it was a very pleasant experience. The whole treatment got completed in two settings and by the 3rd appointment, I could get my cap fixed, and thereafter I did not have any other issues with that tooth. I strongly recommend people in the Sarjapur area to visit Achla clinic and you will get real value for your money as well as professional treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Went for Wisdom teeth extraction at Achala. 
This was the first time I had any tooth problems & I was very much tensed about how things are going to turn out. I had only planned to remove my lowerleft wisdom tooth but Subhash sir & Priya mam advised me to remove both left upper & lower together as it would be the better option. They explained me each process step by step which helped me in getting through.I got muscle stiffness during the procedure & got very much nervous but Dr.Srikanth was very much patient and in the end it went well. Also they followed up to check if I am doing fine which makes Achala stand out from other clinics.
