It was not only inconvenient but not very hygienic also. Then she had few more teeth to be taken out. Then we met Dr. Saurabh Gupta. He suggested permanent solution with implant. The way he explained how it works and all the options with their merits and de-merits it was just amazing and showed his expertise in the field. We went for ten implants and complete permanent teeth. All through the process Dr. Saurabh Gupta was so helpful and did everything with great skill. It has been more than five years and she had absolutely no trouble at all. He did it so well that most of the time she forgets that she has artificial teeth. I would recommend Dr. Saurabh Gupta for anything you want for dentistry. His skill is unmatched.",

The way he explained how it works and all the options with their merits and de-merits it was just amazing and showed his expertise in the field. We went for ten implants and complete permanent teeth. All through the process Dr. Saurabh Gupta was so helpful and did everything with great skill. It has been more than five years and she had absolutely no trouble at all. He did it so well that most of the time she forgets that she has artificial teeth. I would recommend Dr. Saurabh Gupta for anything you want for dentistry. His skill is unmatched.",
