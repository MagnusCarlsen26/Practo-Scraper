This is for the safety of our patients and our staff. If there is a change in appointment timing the staff may tell you to cancel the appointment and rebook it for you at the allotted slot as we are working with restricted timings. 
Our charges are fixed keeping in mind the quality of care we provide, the materials and equipment used and qualification of our available consultants. You can choose to not take the treatment if you feel it is expensive. It is rather odd that after taking treatment you complain about the cost!",2021-06-12T08:57:55+0000,Dr. Priya Verma

7000 as RCT charges and then 
800 for filling after RCT. 
So total Rs. 8550 for one RCT, crown/cap extra.

Injection application for local anaesthesia was very painful. It still pains after one week. 

Dr. keeps on shouting on her staff. 
I am left with many painful sores in my mouth of the suction cannulae.

Overall, I won't recommend this Dr. to anyone.",2020-12-28 14:48:59,False,False,Verified Patient,"Sorry to hear you feel that way. The charges are informed prior to treatment.  All patients know the charges before treatment is begun. And patient has the option whether to take the treatment or not.  Our prices are in line  with our skill,  experience level of the doctors , the quality of our equipment and the high level of sterlization that we maintain. You were informed of the consultation charge as well as RCT charges prior to treatment . Consultation charges are a one time charge for all new patients and are not charged at every visit.
Our policy regarding wait time is very clear .We see only with appointments. Patients in an emergency or severe pain are accomodated but that also not during pre fixed appointment times. However dental procedures can take time as we are dealing with the human body. If a patient inside the surgery is taking slightly more time,then a slightly longer waiting can happen. It is rarely more than 20-30 minutes. most patients understand that.

 The disposables are being used due to COVID precautions. We have to use a new PPE for each patient while doing aerosol work. Moreover the Root Canal needles used , even though sterlisable are not reused anymore, for safety of the patient as well as our staff. These cannot be compromised on for the safety of our patients as well as our staff.
 Root canal treatment can be painless or slightly painful depending on the condition of the tooth. Infected teeth can be slightly painful during treatment despite our best efforts. Pain can persist for a few days but is controlled if you follow instructions and take your medication properly. Moreover pain perception varies from patient to patient.
  We are working under conditions where all of us are wearing PPE , face shields and since doctors are wearing Full face Respirators our staff is unable to hear us when we talk. We have to speak louder for them to follow instructions. Since we are right next to the patient it is of course a little louder! In case we need materials during treatment we cannot remove the respirators and PPE kits. We have no option but to talk louder so as to give instructions.",2020-12-29T13:42:12+0000,Dr. Priya Verma

Our clinic is extremely hygenic and  we follow all precautions regarding Covid. No patient is checked without a fresh PPE kit and we carry out all the sanitisation procedures recommended after every single patient.  That in fact can lead to some delay. A patient already in the dental chair cannot be told to go out if there is a pain case waiting outside . Most importantly, I would like to point out that we are not an IT or service industry where SOP applies. In healthcare we deal with Human Beings. That is the  critical  difference. For example, a root canal treatment may take 30-45 mins . However in  certain cases it may take 1-2 hours also. These are unforseen one offs but they happen as we deal with people and not machines. Every patient is unique and requires treatment accordingly. Though we plan our time slots carefully, sometimes delays are possible. Rest assured when it is your turn,we will give you our full attention with complete dedication.We could prescribe an oral painkiller if the patient in the waiting area  is in too much pain. However a surgical procedure that is continuing cannot be stopped in the middle and most patients understand that. We cannot run out in our PPE kits to inform or take care of a patient in pain. As we are wearing respirators during working, we take a little time between patients. Although we have multiple dental chairs ,Only one patient is taken in the surgery at a time for safety precautions and we have to sanitise before taking you in. If that leads to delay it cannot be helped as it is the safety protocol.We do not see walk in patients so there is no question of seeing a non appointment patient before you. However there are times when a patient may come early or late leading to more patients. Our waiting and consultation areas are large enough to allow safe distancing.
Hope you can understand that we are working under these  constraints  and strive to take care of our patients to the best of our ability.",2020-09-05T13:56:34+0000,Dr. Priya Verma
