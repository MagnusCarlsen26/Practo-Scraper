,,0,0,YES,I've got my aligners done by Dr. Isha. I was a bit sceptical about how to get my smile corrected and I had a lot of questions and concerns when I went to her. But she explained everything in detail and patiently listened to all my queries. I got her reference from one of my friends and it was worth the visit. She is very professional and friendly and her new clinic is very beautiful. I would recommend her anytime for any dental treatment.,2024-04-09 08:55:53,False,True,Saurav,,,
