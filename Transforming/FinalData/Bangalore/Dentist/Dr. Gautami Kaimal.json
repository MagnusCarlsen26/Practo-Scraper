From the moment I walked in, I was impressed with the cleanliness and modern decor of the office. The staff was incredibly friendly and made me feel at ease right away.\n\nDr. Murali and Dr. Gautami was professional and took the time to explain the procedure to me in detail, addressing all my concerns. The treatment itself was kind of ease, and I felt I was in very capable hands throughout.\n\nScheduling an appointment was a breeze, and the follow-up care was excellent. Overall, I had a GOOD experience and would highly recommend Dr. Murali and Dr. Gautami to anyone in need of dental care.",
