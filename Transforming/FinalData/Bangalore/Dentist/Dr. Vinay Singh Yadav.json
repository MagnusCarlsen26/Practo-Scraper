I must say that it was luck by chance that I met Dr Vinay there. First of all took a bold decision to redo all the facial stitches as soon as he saw my condition. \nFrom there on, Dr. Vinay started to guide me step by step on the entire course of treatments to be done. I started meeting him at his clinic V.K dental clinic.\n\nDr Vinay suggested that i had to undergo implant surgery. Dr Vinay is very knowledgeable in his field and very confident at his decisions. Dr.Vinay and Dr.Keerthana explained the entire course of treatment, care-abouts and post procedural implications very well. There wasn't anything that went out of the way. The surgery was a bit complicated considering my specific case, but Dr.Vinay did his best to ensure it to be successful. Even the cost break-up was very well defined and also Dr.Vinay tried his maximum save the cost wherever possible. Overall i had a great treatment experience at V.K Dental clinic and thanks a lot to Dr.Vinay and Dr.Keerthana for restoring my smile! \ud83d\ude0a",

He looks into the matter properly and comes with easy solutions to our problems. He tries to solve the problem with minimal resources and doesn't scare the patient by telling a surgery is required and has to be done right away. He makes sure that the patient is comfortable and diagnoses the problem and explains it clearly to the patient and then suggests the solution. His technique is excellent and i myself have got a wisdom tooth knocked out with ease though my teeth was not completely open. His guidance helped me recover very soon. Overall I'm happy with the clinic, doctor and the equipments. My suggestion please do visit the clinic once and you can feel safe.",

I must say that it was luck by chance that I met Dr Vinay there. First of all took a bold decision to redo all the facial stitches as soon as he saw my condition. \nFrom there on, Dr. Vinay started to guide me step by step on the entire course of treatments to be done. I started meeting him at his clinic V.K dental clinic.\n\nDr Vinay suggested that i had to undergo implant surgery. Dr Vinay is very knowledgeable in his field and very confident at his decisions. Dr.Vinay and Dr.Keerthana explained the entire course of treatment, care-abouts and post procedural implications very well. There wasn't anything that went out of the way. The surgery was a bit complicated considering my specific case, but Dr.Vinay did his best to ensure it to be successful. Even the cost break-up was very well defined and also Dr.Vinay tried his maximum save the cost wherever possible. Overall i had a great treatment experience at V.K Dental clinic and thanks a lot to Dr.Vinay and Dr.Keerthana for restoring my smile! \ud83d\ude0a",

He looks into the matter properly and comes with easy solutions to our problems. He tries to solve the problem with minimal resources and doesn't scare the patient by telling a surgery is required and has to be done right away. He makes sure that the patient is comfortable and diagnoses the problem and explains it clearly to the patient and then suggests the solution. His technique is excellent and i myself have got a wisdom tooth knocked out with ease though my teeth was not completely open. His guidance helped me recover very soon. Overall I'm happy with the clinic, doctor and the equipments. My suggestion please do visit the clinic once and you can feel safe.",
