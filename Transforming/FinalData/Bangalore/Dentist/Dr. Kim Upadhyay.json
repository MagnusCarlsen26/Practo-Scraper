I had a problem of severe tooth erosion because of teeth grinding and had lost almost 50% of enamel volume across all teeth, and I also had multiple cavities, one which was so deep that one other dentist told me there was no way to save it. I was treated by Dr Kim, and had a full mouth rehabilitation using Zirconium implants. I started with just a root canal, but took Dr Kim's advise to go for a full reconstruction which I realised is a good investment for the rest of my life. She didn't put any pressure on me and gave me all options. Now I have my smile from college days (I am 41 now) and a much better bite. A few years later, I might have had to go for expensive implants. Thank you Dr Kim.",

I was told that it was complex and hence will be Rs 2000. What can one do after the treatment has been done. An increase of 2.5 times without even informing the patient.\n\nIt is a day light loot. No bill given. I would like to be beware before going there and confirm the price.\n\nP.S: The service isn't bad. But as a patient i deserve to know the price which you have taken almost 2.5 times without even informing once. And i still don't understand about complexity as it was non surgical extraction and everywhere else even the big chains are not charging Rs. 2000 for it. ",

The whole treatment just took us 2weeks while the other doctors quoted us atleast two months for the same treatment with 2x amount of the cost. She also was very friendly and approachable in terms of the explanations and coming up with quick alternative solutions. Also her finesse and skills are amazing. Most recommended.

I had a problem of severe tooth erosion because of teeth grinding and had lost almost 50% of enamel volume across all teeth, and I also had multiple cavities, one which was so deep that one other dentist told me there was no way to save it. I was treated by Dr Kim, and had a full mouth rehabilitation using Zirconium implants. I started with just a root canal, but took Dr Kim's advise to go for a full reconstruction which I realised is a good investment for the rest of my life. She didn't put any pressure on me and gave me all options. Now I have my smile from college days (I am 41 now) and a much better bite. A few years later, I might have had to go for expensive implants. Thank you Dr Kim.",

The whole treatment just took us 2weeks while the other doctors quoted us atleast two months for the same treatment with 2x amount of the cost. She also was very friendly and approachable in terms of the explanations and coming up with quick alternative solutions. Also her finesse and skills are amazing. Most recommended. My mom is very happy with the treatment. ",

Both of them got fillings and one of them had his molars sealed. She also discussed possible root cause for the issues.\n\nShe explained to the kids the problem with poor brushing. My son has improved his brushing technique after she explained it to him and has promised to drink at least 1.5 ltrs of water every day. This is the kind of personal connection and empathy that I like about her, ***** **** *** **** ****** ** ***********\nI appreciate what she has done for my kids and feel lucky to have found her.
