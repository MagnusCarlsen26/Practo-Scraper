I had been to neodentistree for wisdom tooth extraction and Dr. Gayathri took care of it with ease. She explained in detail about the procedure, what and how it will be done and educates about the procedure well before the treatment. She has a lot of patience, is calm and listens to the patients worries. I can tell that you don't have to fear for pain during treatment as she is highly experienced and professional. I keep a smile after visiting Neodentistree. Would highly recommend this place for any treatments.",
