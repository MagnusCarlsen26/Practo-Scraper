Dr.Neerja personally ensures that every one of her patients are treated in the best possible way. She instils confidence in all and is fully in control at the clinic, managing front desk and doctors with her oversight.\n\nShe is very friendly, reassuring and is extremely patient in answering questions and explaining procedures to young patients and elder alike.\n \nI have also taken my 88 year old father for dental issues. She understands what is important for him and does not extend the treatment to more than what is required.\n\nDr.Neerja deftly uses technology to ensure all patient medical records are stored and easily retrieved.\n\nThe charges at the clinic are very nominal. Never have I got a feel that the treatment is recommended when it is not absolutely necessary. \n\nStrongly recommend this clinic to all",

Everyone (Dr. Neeraja, Dr. Poonam, Dr. Vivek) at Little Pearls is caring and meticulous. In every instance, the job was done right the first time.\n\nWe also consulted Dr. Vivek (Orthodontist) for alignment and he did a tremendously great job treating both my daughter and I. He's very approachable and helps us online too, if we have an urgent question.\n\nWe have always been fairly billed. Never over-charged. Every single charge was clearly explained to us.\n\nI highly recommend Little Pearls!\n\nThank you everyone at Little Pearls!",

When we work on young children, the time framework will be taken into consideration, depending on the behaviour of the individual child. As the child has come for the extraction of shaking tooth, that is pre shedding mobility, the local anaesthetic spray was used to make the gum tissue numb for few minutes, before the shaking tooth was gently removed. The local anesthetic spray bottle always comes with bent pipe for easy access to different areas of mouth. Once the spraying is done, the nozzle and the pipe will be disinfected with surgical spirit. We give utmost importance for sterilization.. All the surgical tools used will be autoclaved and packed in steripak. We never do any procedure with out gloves, unless some patients are allergic to latex gloves, alternative nitrile gloves will be used.",

Spray that they used to numb the gums had a bent pipe that touched my daughter\u2019s gums, was that pipe changed after the previous patient? No, as the pipe is attached to the cork of the bottle. It is gross that the pipe had gone into several mouths before my daughter\u2019s.\n\nEverything was rushed to be completed giving very less to no opportunity for me to speak up else I would have walked out of the clinic.\n",

The staff is very cooperative and friendly \n3. Treatment is given according to what is really needed without unnecessary treatments/procedures\n4. With cost wise it has been great experience as we never felt she charges unnecessarily though multiple X-rays are taken to analyse the issue\n5. Whenever she suggests something to be done, i blindly go ahead without any thoughts and have just given my kids dental care in her hand\n6. I would strongly recommend Dr Neeraja for dental care for kids and also adults.",

All her upper front tooth were broken mainly because of falling and partly because of bottle feeding .  we were apprehensive about root canal and other treatment plans that Dr. Neerja suggested.  But after a few sessions now we are really grateful to Dr Neerja that my daughter Smiles confidently and has all her tooth back.  my daughter loves going back to her again.\n\n I strongly recommend doctor Neerja for her expertise in paediatric dentistry.",

She explained all the procedures in detailed way so that people can understand very clearly . After 1 month of treatment we did not see any issues.  Also one good part of doctor is that she remembers people who are going on for treatment and she remembers the patient history itself . I would recommend this hospital and doctors for all dental treatment . Dr speaks English, Kanada , Tamil , Hindi very fluently and i think it will help others a lot. \n\nEven Me and my sister had tooth checkup by Dr.Poonam and everything went well . \n\nThanks\n\n",

They charged us way lower than the going price outside. I would recommend her to anyone. They're hygienic, efficient and quick. Very less waiting time, and good follow up. ",

We were asked to wait after one round of checkup, then called to discuss the issue, then, again asked to wait outside, then, again called in for X-Ray and one of us was asked to take the crying child outside very rudely since that was creating noise. Staff is quire cordial but Ambience needs improvement. Children play area can be removed since it's too small and the stuffed toys kept there are pretty dirty, and must be washed immediately. The restroom is adjacent to kid's play area hence, the play area must be moved out of there or removed completely. Doc was good in explaining the problem but was very impatient with the child and suggested oral sedation. Won't recommend for toddlers.",

Every adult patient will be informed prior to take a decision regarding the type of crown if it is a metal crown, pfm crown or zirconia crown what they have to select. According to the crown selected, the biological principles of crown preparation will be done and the measurement will be taken and the lab will fabricate the crown which is custom made according to the particular space availability which will be seated by using a special luting cement. This is how the crowns are prepared for permanent teeth. In case of children teeth, after pulpectomy is done we have custom made crowns called stainless steel crowns which are prefabricated and come in 7 sizes . Depending on the size of the deciduous tooth, the particular size of stainless steel crown will be selected and a slight proximal clearance will be created and the crown will be seated . The deciduous tooth will not require that much of preparation like permanent tooth. So as per the doubt raised hope the concept is understood. ",

As you had visited our clinic for crowding of teeth there was lots of calculus and the first round of scaling was completed. You needed to come for the completion of your oral prophylaxis. The amount of 1000 is for the entire service. So you can get back to us regarding the completion of your treatment",
