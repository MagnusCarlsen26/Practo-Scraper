With an x-ray, Mr. Ali concluded that 2 RCs and 2 wisdom tooth extractions need to be done. While we were a bit sceptical in doing the RC since uncle was planning a travel the next day, Mr. Ali suggested to do the extraction and later do the RC in Chennai (my FIL's native where he periodically consults a dentist) since FIL was groaning in pain. Mr. Ali also asked me to click a pic of the x-ray since printing the same would incur additional charges. Additionally, Mr. Ali also mentioned that the extraction procedure done was reimbursable with an insurance. I did not even think twice to say yes because i was already moved by his gesture earlier and thought that the extraction cost would be marginal given that the cost of RC itself is 4K. My FIL told me that the procedure was neatly done and it was completely painless. However, we were charged Rs. 9200 for the procedure which was super exorbitant.
