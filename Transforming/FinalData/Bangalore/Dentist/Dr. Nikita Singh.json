She quickly identified the issue and provided only the necessary treatment, avoiding unnecessary procedures that could have increased costs without benefiting my condition.\n\nPrior to visiting Dr. Singh, I had consulted another dentist closer to my home. They recommended several fancy and irrelevant procedures, clearly aiming to exploit the situation for financial gain. In stark contrast, Dr. Singh and the Apollo team demonstrated genuine care for their patients. The problem was explained clearly, and the proposed treatment plan was both necessary and budget-friendly.\n\nDr. Singh's approach to complex issues is also commendable. She explains everything in a manner that comforts the patient( unlike the intimidating manner of Dr. House from the TV show! ) She takes her time to ensure the patient is comfortable, even if it requires multiple sittings.\n\nAdditionally, the appointment reminders were very helpful. I received reminders a day prior and on the day of the appointment, which greatly helped me stay organized.\n\nOverall, my root canal treatment was a wonderful and smooth experience. I highly recommend Dr. Nikita Singh for her professionalism, patient-centric approach, and transparent treatment plans.",

The dentist coordinated the process flawlessly, ensuring continuity of care and a smooth transition between procedures. The end result is a beautifully fitted crown that blends seamlessly with my natural teeth, thanks to the expertise of both the dentist and the specialist doctor.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Nikita Singh for their professionalism, expertise, and comprehensive approach to dental care.

I'm grateful for the exceptional care I received and look forward to returning for future dental needs!",

I would like to share my review based on my experience with her. \n\nFirst and foremost, I visited Apollo Dental due to a tooth pain, and Dr. Nikita provided me with a thorough diagnosis. She confirmed that the pain was indeed caused by an infection, which put my mind at ease, knowing the cause of my discomfort.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns was preserving the tooth since it had already undergone a root canal treatment. Dr. Nikita went above and beyond to address this concern. She took the extra step of calling in the regional head of Apollo Dental to assist in cutting my crown, as there were complications surrounding it. This level of attention and dedication to preserving my tooth was truly commendable.\n\nThroughout the entire course of the root canal treatment, Dr. Nikita took the time to explain the process to me and what I could expect during each appointment. Her clear explanations helped me understand the treatment better and alleviated any anxieties I had.\n\nDr. Nikita's patience with my anxieties was exceptional. She provided me with full support and reassurance throughout the entire course of the treatment. Her compassionate approach made me feel comfortable and confident in her care.\n\nAnother aspect that impressed me was Dr. Nikita's punctuality. She was always on time for our appointments and even provided upfront notice if there was a slight delay, which I greatly appreciated. Her professionalism and respect for my time did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe entire treatment process took about a month, and I appreciated that Dr. Nikita did not rush things. She wanted to ensure that the infection was settled properly before completing the treatment. This level of diligence and attention to detail demonstrated her commitment to providing the best possible care.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with the treatment I received from Dr. Nikita Singh at Apollo Dental. Her expertise, dedication, and patient-centered approach were exemplary. I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking dental treatment, and I am confident that she would provide the same exceptional care to my friends and family.",

They recommended several fancy and irrelevant procedures, clearly aiming to exploit the situation for financial gain. In stark contrast, Dr. Singh and the Apollo team demonstrated genuine care for their patients. The problem was explained clearly, and the proposed treatment plan was both necessary and budget-friendly.\n\nDr. Singh's approach to complex issues is also commendable. She explains everything in a manner that comforts the patient( unlike the intimidating manner of Dr. House from the TV show! ) She takes her time to ensure the patient is comfortable, even if it requires multiple sittings.\n\nAdditionally, the appointment reminders were very helpful. I received reminders a day prior and on the day of the appointment, which greatly helped me stay organized.\n\nOverall, my root canal treatment was a wonderful and smooth experience. I highly recommend Dr. Nikita Singh for her professionalism, patient-centric approach, and transparent treatment plans.",

The end result is a beautifully fitted crown that blends seamlessly with my natural teeth, thanks to the expertise of both the dentist and the specialist doctor.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Nikita Singh for their professionalism, expertise, and comprehensive approach to dental care.

I would like to share my review based on my experience with her. \n\nFirst and foremost, I visited Apollo Dental due to a tooth pain, and Dr. Nikita provided me with a thorough diagnosis. She confirmed that the pain was indeed caused by an infection, which put my mind at ease, knowing the cause of my discomfort.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns was preserving the tooth since it had already undergone a root canal treatment. Dr. Nikita went above and beyond to address this concern. She took the extra step of calling in the regional head of Apollo Dental to assist in cutting my crown, as there were complications surrounding it. This level of attention and dedication to preserving my tooth was truly commendable.\n\nThroughout the entire course of the root canal treatment, Dr. Nikita took the time to explain the process to me and what I could expect during each appointment. Her clear explanations helped me understand the treatment better and alleviated any anxieties I had.\n\nDr. Nikita's patience with my anxieties was exceptional. She provided me with full support and reassurance throughout the entire course of the treatment. Her compassionate approach made me feel comfortable and confident in her care.\n\nAnother aspect that impressed me was Dr. Nikita's punctuality. She was always on time for our appointments and even provided upfront notice if there was a slight delay, which I greatly appreciated. Her professionalism and respect for my time did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe entire treatment process took about a month, and I appreciated that Dr. Nikita did not rush things. She wanted to ensure that the infection was settled properly before completing the treatment. This level of diligence and attention to detail demonstrated her commitment to providing the best possible care.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with the treatment I received from Dr. Nikita Singh at Apollo Dental. Her expertise, dedication, and patient-centered approach were exemplary. I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking dental treatment, and I am confident that she would provide the same exceptional care to my friends and family.",

As a well-trained, experienced doctor M/S Nikita Singh extended her valuable time and examined the entire area of the mouth.  She organises a consultation with Dr.  Shahbaz and, as per the directions of Dr. Shahbaz she attends to my tooth. They re-routed one of the teeth and fixed the proper bridge also.  Dr. Nikita , Dr. Shahbaz and the team are THE BEST services I ever received.  To continue to check up next trip from Australia, I am coming to Whitefield, India. I am so lucky to get the services from a great professional setup. It is my privilege to me the opportunity to express my feedback about your services.",

She examined my case carefully and patiently understood the entire history. I got a filling done on one side and it was a very smooth procedure. I didn't even realise and the procedure was over in no time. The thing I appreciated most about her was her empathy with the patient. She kept checking with me whether I felt any discomfort during the procedure and she would calibrate her response accordingly. She showed me images of my teeth before and after the process with complete transparency. She also explained what to be expect for a couple of days and the do's and donts' that I needed to follow. She is also very approachable after the consultation and responded quickly over whatsapp when I had a couple of questions.\n\nI had a very comfortable experience consulting her as this is the level of clarity, transparency, information and empathy that I expect but generally don't see in many doctors. I would highly recommend her for any dental treatment.",
