The best thing about Doctor Divya is she is very responsive and addresses to the case proactively over WhatsApp and calls . She follows up about the patient on regular basis which allow us to share in case of any issues without hesitation. We had to go for wisdom tooth extraction and she got an expertise surgeon and the extraction was done so friendly and smoothly. She listen to the patient's concerns and suggest the right and required treatment. One good thing abo Dr Divya is she has her own clinic and you can get the concerns addressed w r t dental braces in fastest way unlike other orthodontist who visits their partners clinic ok monthly basis. I will post another review after few months of treatment and results. I highly recommend to visit Puranik's dental care for any dental services.Thank you Dr Divya for the care and support you show to the patient. Wer really appreciate your service.",

We've never had to wait for our turn even a single time. She makes herself available exactly at the appointment time.\nWe are so far very happy with her and highly recommend her.\nWe have several more sittings to go before the final outcome, so I'll post another review at the end.",

The best thing about Doctor Divya is she is very responsive and addresses to the case proactively over WhatsApp and calls . She follows up about the patient on regular basis which allow us to share in case of any issues without hesitation. We had to go for wisdom tooth extraction and she got an expertise surgeon and the extraction was done so friendly and smoothly. She listen to the patient's concerns and suggest the right and required treatment. One good thing abo Dr Divya is she has her own clinic and you can get the concerns addressed w r t dental braces in fastest way unlike other orthodontist who visits their partners clinic ok monthly basis. I will post another review after few months of treatment and results. I highly recommend to visit Puranik's dental care for any dental services.Thank you Dr Divya for the care and support you show to the patient. Wer really appreciate your service.",

We've never had to wait for our turn even a single time. She makes herself available exactly at the appointment time.\nWe are so far very happy with her and highly recommend her.\nWe have several more sittings to go before the final outcome, so I'll post another review at the end.",
