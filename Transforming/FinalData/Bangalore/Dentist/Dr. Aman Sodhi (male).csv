However, elaborating my experience during and after the dental treatment explains the service blueprint of the treatment process. I had one of my tooth filling in quadrant-3 molar tooth fallen/ chipped of during COVID-19 lockdown, had no other option but to postpone the treatment. Over a period of time, the tooth had infected beyond regular filling and it needed “Root Canal Treatment” (at this point I was so paranoid, that I gave a thought of not getting the treatment). With no option left; agreed for a “Root Canal Treatment” half heartedly. I have seen both my parents getting RCT and both of them had bad experiences and lot of pain during the procedure. Dr. Aman ensured, RCT will not pain and assured she would take care and nothing to worry. I was very paranoid as the  RCT procedure was about to begin, Kudos to the patience of Dr. Aman (haven’t seen a doctor as patient as she is); she was very cautious and patient throughout the process. She explained me about the process during treatment and also prepared me (this made me aware of what is about to come).  Dr. Aman used to crack jokes and put me into a conversation to divert my attention during the treatment so that I don’t think of pain and be aware of the process. In the end RCT, went well; however it was not the easy one for Dr. Aman - there were 4 canines in the tooth and it took longer for her to finish; may be she would have finished it in 2 visits, but to my paranoid attitude she took 4 clinic visits to finish the process. Dr. Aman is hands on in judging the situation and understanding the problem - also she resolves the problem with best solution. 

Now, I blindly trust Dr. Aman and follow her instructions when it about my dental health, though I got couple of my dental fillings redone after RCT treatment, the first experience is always a laying stone for future. Now I recommend all my loved ones to go to Dr. Aman for dental treatment.

It took around 6 sittings to get my root canal done and each sitting about an hour because of my limited mouth opening. She was patient, and she put me at ease while making sure that I was comfortable during the procedure. This is the most enjoyable dental procedure I’ve done despite it being very complex. Her fees are so very reasonable and I was very pleased that every charge was explained to me and at every point there was full transparency.
