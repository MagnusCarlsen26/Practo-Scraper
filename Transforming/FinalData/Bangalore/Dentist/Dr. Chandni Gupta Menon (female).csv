I got my filling and general cleaning done at this clinic. A bit about Dr. Chandni-
1. Extremely patient. I talked a lot and she responded to all comments 
2. ************* The answers I received on my queries, be it related to the treatment I went to get, or in general dental science, she answered all satisfactorily
3. Knows what she is doing. Filling on the teeth, upside and on the sides, was a bit uneven. So she adjusted it and it was fixed for top. Yet on the sides it was uneven. She corrected it just enough to align it to the other teeths. 
4. Polite.
