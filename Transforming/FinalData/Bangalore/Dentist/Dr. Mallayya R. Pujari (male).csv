I met with Dr. Pujari to discuss my teeth alignment and shared my expectations with him. He listened patiently and offered suggestions to bring my expectations to fruition.

The alignment of my teeth has now been achieved through the assistance of Dr. Purjari.

 I recommend Dr Pujari for the following reasons;

Patience: It is an essential quality for doctors to be patient while listening to their patients' concerns in order to understand and address them.

The doctor cannot always be economical : in the event that things do not go as planned, the doctor should be able to extend the treatment without putting the patient at an undue financial burden.

Trust and assistance: It is the responsibility of doctors to establish trust and provide assistance to patients in times of difficulty

Happy ending: The patient should leave with a smile at the end of the treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"I went with tooth sharp radiating tooth pain on Sept 14 2020.  Dr. MR Pujari heard me patiently and after checking he prescribed root canal treatment. The tooth was filled once 6 years back. 

Total procedure took 4 visits (including fixing cap/crown). Dr. Srivatsa  said he goes slow to avoid any reinfection after RCT. 

-  First visit (approximately 15 mins, By Dr MR Pujari):  The tooth was 
drilled little bit and cleaned. Did not have pain after first session.   
-  Second visit (approx. 45 mins): Tooth preparation was done and cap measurement was taken by Dr Pujari. Half of the RCT was done by Dr. Srivatsa. Dr. Srivatsa was friendly and patient.  
-  Third visit (20 mins, Dr Srivatsa) : RCT was completed. 
-  4th visit (15 mins) : Cap fixing was done by some Lady doctor. 

Overall experience : Very good and painless RCT experience. 

Cons : Not as such. 

Note : Not sure if I can mention it here. Doctor could have advised not to take food till local anesthesia subsides. I bit my lips many times (As sensation was nill I did not realize I was biting myself :) ) as I started taking dinner just after 3rd visit. I realized it only after sometime.

Ours is seventeen year old clinic. It is old but not unhygienic because even we breathe here. Our patients treatment is always a priority for us. I am a cosmetic dentist and a surgeon. I start and finish root canal with cap placement. In between one session is always done by root Canal specialist (not any junior doctor). If root canal fails, it is due to chronic infection,means if patient comes to us with late infection stage ,root canal cannot be guaranteed. At our clinic we do 100-150 root canals monthly out of which 5-10 can fail because poor prognosis of tooth. And it is same in all clinics of the world.
