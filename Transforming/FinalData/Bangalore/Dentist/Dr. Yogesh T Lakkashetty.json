I came in for my son's sudden tooth ache, which started at night, and I panicked and contacted Practo and searched all the nearest dentists who would be available at the earliest and sent him a request for the earliest appointment. To my surprise he contacted me asking if there was an emergency seeing I had booked an appointment late at night. Honestly, this is what I was looking for in a medical practitioner, i.e. genuine care and concern towards their patient. Once I visited, my son was diagnosed that he had to get a RCT. Since he is of a very young age I was worried about the treatment, which the doctor consoled me by explaining all the reason behind it and how he will carry it out which was another reason for me to choose him as my dentist. My son never complained once during the treatment, that was a plus point. Seeing how he treats I decided to get my treatments done by him. I got a RCT, a wisdom tooth extraction along with a small surgery, also got my teeth aligned. He never settles for anything that is average in treatment, strives for the best for his patients. His team  comprises talented surgeons and orthodontists who perform efficiently. I suggested that many of my relatives and friends visit him for their treatment. I hope he gets to treat more and more people who are in need. Thank you doctor for doing an amazing job. ",

With my apprehensions and severe wisdom tooth issues, I went to visit him.\nFrom the first day itself, his friendliness, knowledge and the ease with which the doctor works impressed me. He is not an amateur! Anyone with basic biology knowledge can figure it out. He is really good at what he does. \n\nI came for a complicated case of wisdoms tooth extraction. My lower jaw was cracked and swollen by another dentist but Dr Yogesh assured me nothing such should ever or will happen. My tooth crown was crooked and hence, a surgery had to be performed. I was scared to death but the surgery went on smoothly with zero complications! \n\nNext I went for clear aligners which took 1 year to get my smile corrected. I have completed the course with utmost satisfaction. My sister and husband also go to him. Dr Yogesh is literally our family doctor and would definitely recommend Him without any question.\n\nThis is not a paid review but a testimony of my dental woes addressed right especially after having such bad experiences with the other dentists! This is the reason I\u2019m extremely happy with Dr Yogi because he kinda changed my perception about dentists. \n\nYou should definitely visit him. He is a very simple man, with a trail of experience under his belt.",

Since he is of a very young age I was worried about the treatment, which the doctor consoled me by explaining all the reason behind it and how he will carry it out which was another reason for me to choose him as my dentist. My son never complained once during the treatment, that was a plus point. Seeing how he treats I decided to get my treatments done by him. Thank you doctor for doing an amazing job.",

I had one dead tooth, and one wisdom tooth that was disturbing a nearby tooth and had caused puss formation. Used to be really painful before. I got two RCT\u2019s and one Tooth Extraction done in 3 sittings. Was honestly too scared of the whole deal, but the doctor made me really comfortable, was constantly checking with me during the treatment, explaining me what he\u2019s doing and made sure there was no pain at all. He also took his time to check on me via phone calls in between the sittings. He\u2019s a very caring person by nature, a true hallmark of a great doctor. Now my teeth are picture perfect and I owe the doctor a lot for his kindness and providing me the right treatment without any pain. If you\u2019re someone like me who is scared of hospitals and can\u2019t take pain, this is the doctor for you! I highly recommend you to book a session with Doctor Yogesh!",

He used anesthesia while surgery and the extraction was painless, but after 3 hours when anesthesia effect was gone the pain was unbearable for which he prescribed me some antibiotics and pain killers for 3 days.

The awkward growth of one had decayed the adjacent molar without my knowledge, and the filling from another molar had come off. He suggested root canal procedures for both as the best course of action and the extraction of my upper wisdom teeth to avoid more troubles in the future. The diagnosis was very honest, detailed, and quick. He respected my choice to conduct these procedures over three different days to ease my anxiety. He's very attentive to the patient's needs during the procedures and also explains every issue well enough for a novice to understand. The procedures went extremely smoothly and painlessly since he was considerate of my slightest discomfort.",

He examined and explained the reason for pain, did x-rays and shown the decay. Suggested for root canal and cap. Went for 3 sittings for treatment and he is very punctual. We both received well quality treatment for a reasonable cost. He has multiple options for caps. Dr. Yogesh is very friendly and gave ample time to explain the details of treatment, Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for brushing etc. I strongly recommend Dr. Yogesh for any sort of dental treatment because of his experience, knowledge, friendliness and treatment cost.

To my surprise he contacted me asking if there was an emergency and asked me to visit  clinic immediately it was around 10:15 pm Honestly, this is what I was looking for in a medical practitioner, i.e. genuine care and concern towards their patient. Once I visited,I was diagnosed and had x ray in the clinic itself, he cleared the cavity and gave big relief thanks so much Dr. he had suggested to me root canal treatment for one tooth and extraction of one tooth .He did a painless extraction and Root canal treatment he has done nicely. remaining teeth filling also done in the same visit... he saved my teeth.Thanks a lot Dr",

But I preferred regular bridge and now I can eat whatever I want. But I should have gone for implant actually only it was little more expensive I could not afford.  My front teeth gaps are also closed using tooth colored fillers and he avoided caps. Thanks to dr yogesh for making me ready before my marriage. ",

Doctor discussed the problems of retaining the wisdom tooth and assured there won't be any complications upon removal, and rather it would help to maintain better health of the adjacent functional tooth. I appreciated the advice and discussion as it helped me to make educated decision. Initial pain was managed well. I also got my cavities filled. Overall I had a positive experience.",
