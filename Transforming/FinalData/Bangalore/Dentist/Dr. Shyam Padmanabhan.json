                "review_text": "The consultation is for mother who is an elderly lady. We visited for tooth ache, and were immediately very comfortable for doctor with the way he explained the issue and provided us the treatment plan. Affected tooth needed root canal, but since it was infected, doctor cleared off the pus first and later on next visit completed the RCT. The procedure was almost painless which was surprise to us as we had heard RCT is usually very painful procedure. My mother over time due to improper care and lack of treatment had developed issues in multiple teeth. Since doctor was so efficient and friendly we proceed to go for complete treatment, which included multiple tooth extractions, 2 RCT, placement of bridges and implant.\nIts been now close to 3 months since we are following up with Dr. Shyam and we were never let down by him. Most of complicated procedures were done so efficiently that it was almost painless. \nWe are nearing end of treatment and will now wait for couple of months before getting implant for missing tooth.\nMy mother is much better condition now and her eating capability have significantly improved.\nI would like to thank doctor and his staff for all good work, friendliness and making treatment so easy and comfortable for both patient and family.

He made it clear that my problem can be easily solved with good oral hygiene as suggested by him. He was upfront in telling me to visit him next only if I follow the  oral hygiene steps as suggested by him else it's of no use.\nI visited him 3 times and am following his advice to the core.\n It has been 7 months and no bleeding at all.\nI would recommend Dr. Shyam to everyone who is looking for a genuine doctor in today's  world!\nThank you doc!\n",

We visited for tooth ache, and were immediately very comfortable for doctor with the way he explained the issue and provided us the treatment plan. Affected tooth needed root canal, but since it was infected, doctor cleared off the pus first and later on next visit completed the RCT. The procedure was almost painless which was surprise to us as we had heard RCT is usually very painful procedure. My mother over time due to improper care and lack of treatment had developed issues in multiple teeth. Since doctor was so efficient and friendly we proceed to go for complete treatment, which included multiple tooth extractions, 2 RCT, placement of bridges and implant.\nIts been now close to 3 months since we are following up with Dr. Shyam and we were never let down by him. Most of complicated procedures were done so efficiently that it was almost painless. \nWe are nearing end of treatment and will now wait for couple of months before getting implant for missing tooth.\nMy mother is much better condition now and her eating capability have significantly improved.\nI would like to thank doctor and his staff for all good work, friendliness and making treatment so easy and comfortable for both patient and family.

He made it clear that my problem can be easily solved with good oral hygiene as suggested by him. He was upfront in telling me to visit him next only if I follow the  oral hygiene steps as suggested by him else it's of no use.\nI visited him 3 times and am following his advice to the core.\n It has been 7 months and no bleeding at all.\nI would recommend Dr. Shyam to everyone who is looking for a genuine doctor in today's  world!\nThank you doc!\n",

I fist visited Dr. Padmanabhan during the summer of 2016. My gum was in extremely bad condition with loads of bleeding. I had lost two teeth by then and a few teeth were shaking. \nDr. Padmanabhan did an excellent job in cleaning my gum first. Thereafter, he explained the disease to me. And, it turned out to be \"Aggressive Periodontitis\". He then performed a series of flap surgeries along with \"bone grafting\" to restore my gum. He also gave instructions on maintaining oral hygiene on a regular basis. \nNow, one year after my initial surgery, my gum is healthier. There is no bleeding and I no longer suffer from bad breathe. I would highly recommend Dr. Padmanabhan. He is friendly and approachable. ***** ** ** ********* ************* *** confident about his treatment.  ",

The professionalism, the proper care and focus on ailment correction was what I found very good here. The value for money was icing on the cake.Most of the clinics I have visited in the past tried to push n sell additional services rather than focusing on the main problem,thankfully I didnot experince this problem here. I would surely recommend this clinc as I know how difficult it is to find a genuine doctor these days.",

Dr. Shyam Padmanabhan will answer all your queries and you could sense his experience in his answers. He seemed to me, like a professional at work. The waiting is almost negligible if you reach as per the appointment. He operates and explains and everything goes very smooth. They are always available for their patients. \nOverall I would say I am extremely happy and upset that I could not continue and had to be in kolkata but we ended with a proper dental status and discussion and with a plan in mind.",

He even had a chat with my little one on how to, avoid the issues and have healty eating habits. And to point out in particular, he was very punctual with the appointment time, which is very very rare among doctors now a days. Overall it was very satisfactory.",

However, I would like to highlight the fact that you never brought this to my notice that the restoration done by one of my doctors was improper. If you had I surely would have solved it. Regarding experience, the doctors who attended to you are qualified degree holders with minimum two years of experience who have undergone training under me, unlike most corporate clinics, where recruitment is based primarily on vacancy. There was NO lack of communication between them as assumed by you. It so happens the initial restoration was a GI restoration which was given to observe if we could restore with Composite (if asymptomatic) rather than push you directly for a root canal treatment. That was exactly what they did. However, post resin restoration could have its own disadvantages. But we could have solved it IF YOU HAD NOT MISSED THE LAST APPOINTMENT. To err is human. Not to correct it would amount to negligence. Disappointed that our society by and large would not appreciate good work but are ready to point fingers at the smallest of errors. It is sad that doctors are judged individually by patients and there is no way they can judge the patients who make working difficult for them.\nThank you.",

There seems to be miss comm or no proper handover b/w the doc which caused issues in completing the work. *** ****** *** **** **** ****** It stated with mild pain even if i chew any thing using that tooth. I gave it some time to understand if the pain subsides but its worsening day by day. I feel the issue is with the new doctors who are working under Dr shyam.

We believe in making patients understand the procedures before we execute the treatment plan, as INFORMED DECISION and awareness is an important aspect of our policy (These are not lectures!!). We have NOT recommended any change of prosthesis and even if we do we would do it using our TIME and RESOURCES and not burden the patient. To err is human, but we do not hesitate to correct any of our errors (if any) with patients comfort, energy, time and money in mind.\nYour complaints from the beginning were headache, neck pain and jaw discomfort unrelated to the current implants/ prosthesis.\nYou had already consulted other Dentists (for a second opinion) and got it certified from them, that the implant treatment was well and was good (as described by you). \nEven your Neurologist had given you clearance that your symptoms are NOT because of the Dental Implants.\nYour treating Maxillofacial Prosthodontist and Implantologist has done a fine job and never was in doubt regarding the prosthesis. However, since you desired a change in Prosthesis he had given you various alternate treatment options. \nI request you to kindly read the alternate treatment options provided in depth and please let us execute the plan accordingly. Thank you.",
