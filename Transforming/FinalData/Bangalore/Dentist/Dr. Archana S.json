As I was staying at the Bangalore Hilton, I visited a local dentist. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and the doctor was curt and suspected I had developed Gingivitis because of the braces I was on. Given that I have always maintained excellent oral hygiene I wasn\u2019t convinced with his viewpoints and wanted a second opinion.  \n\nOut of desperation and in pursuit of a good dentist, I took a leap of faith and Searched on Practo. Based on the excellent feedbacks and 5 star reviews about Dr Archana at Dental Trendz, I trusted my instinct and visited her. She struck me as a young but experienced dentist. After what seemed like a comprehensive assessment; she explained that there was extensive soft tissue damage, swelling and bleeding due to the protruding arch wires from the braces. She explained the process as she continued to meticulously work on the wires. The doctor was very patient and delicately moved the wires that were sticking out. Dr Archana also reassured that the sores are a common occurrence with the braces and suggested some simple remedies. The appointment with the doctor went off without a hitch and undeniably Dr Archana was professional, caring and kind. Even the treatment was inexpensively priced. \n\nThe rest of my stay was pleasant, enjoyable and memorable.\n\nAt a time when I felt helpless and the chances of finding a good dentist seemed bleak, almost like \u201cBuilding Castles in Spain\u201d; Dr Archana came to my rescue like a guardian angel. I came to realise good dentists are few and far between but Dr Archana certainly is one of them and a beacon of hope. Thanks to Practo and reviewers\u2019 feedback for helping me find a brilliant and astute Dentist who I\u2019d highly recommend. My braces are off and I don\u2019t have to hide my smile as I now have a perfect one!!\n",

After a thorough examination Dr Archana informed the tooth was severely decayed and needed to be removed. As I hadn\u2019t eaten or slept for two days because of the agonizing pain, I requested for it to be  done pronto, the same day! After evaluation and perusal of my medical records,she concluded she couldn\u2019t proceed safely due to high risk of bleeding as I was on anticoagulant medication and asked my permission to discuss with my Hospital Physician.\n\nAfter getting the green light from my physician, Dr Archana proceeded to carry out the extraction. It almost felt like a pain free procedure. After cautiously stitching the area, she reiterated the risks, provided information on after care and advised me to contact her if there was a problem and also advised me to access the hospital emergency services if the bleeding was profuse. \n\nUnfortunately I panicked as I started to bleed the next morning and contacted Dr Archana. She requested me to come to her clinic straight away although it was an hour and a half before her actual opening time. After another thorough examination, she reassured me it was unlikely to have a serious consequence but it\u2019s prudent to repeat the blood tests and consult my Physician as a precautionary measure. In fact Dr Archana herself spoke to the Hospital and managed to get an urgent appointment for me. I remember Dr Archana making frequent phone calls on the day whilst I was anxiously waiting at the hospital , to check if I was ok. Thankfully the blood results were normal and bleeding had stopped and the pain also had completely subsided. \n\nI had lost all hopes as I believed it was beyond redemption but I have subsequently had a dental implant in place at Dental Trendz with no complications and I\u2019m also frequently being reviewed by Dr Archana. I am extremely delighted with the results and I would like to thank Dr Archana for her flexibility, patience, humbleness, sympathy, decorum, meticulousness and the incredible help, support, clinical skills and outstanding five-star treatment. I wish we had more doctors like her. I truly am indebted to you Dr Archana. You\u2019re one in a million!!",

But for the last 4 years Dr Archana has been our family dentist and we feel so amazingly lucky to have known her. We relocated to Sanjaynagar 2 years ago but we are so comfortable with Dr A that we are even happy to travel the long distance to see her for treatment. \n\nDoctor is confident and an absolutely brilliant dentist. Very kind, warm, gentle, unhurried and treats patients with utmost dignity and respect. She\u2019s always smiling which certainly helps with our anxieties. Reasonable priced, easily available and offers great treatment advice. Always involves patients in the treatment decisions. So happy with the results and I have always come away with a big smile. I\u2019ll happily recommend Dr Archana to everybody. Thank you doctor for the endless hours you had to work on my teeth. You do such an amazing job and you always go above and beyond.",

I was totally impressed with the impeccable customer service. When I arrived I noticed the clinic was spotlessly clean and Dr Archana was very friendly. The experience was enriching from start to finish. Dr Archana took time to explain patiently every process, procedure, potential risks and also realistic timelines to achieve the desired outcomes. Dr Archana  and I discussed and decided together the best course of treatment. \n\nI was completely blown away by Dr Archana's kindness, thoroughness, patience, expertise, hospitableness and professionalism. I was a little antsy, seeking constant reassurance but Dr Archana put me at ease and very patiently explained as she went along. Surprisingly at no time did I feel any pain or discomfort. I had no reason to remonstrate with the doctor as everything was done artistically to perfection.\n\nI can only speak nothing but highly of Dr Archana. I thought there was no salvation at all but with Dr Archana's exemplary, aesthetically focused approach and excellent standard of treatment, I'm absolutely chuffed with the results.\n\nI have absolute confidence in Dr Archana and she has transformed the way I see dentists. Fees were quite reasonable and seemed excellent value for moneey. Dental Trendz certainly deserves a 5 star and I have no qualms or hesitation in recommending Dr Archana and Dental Trendz.",

                "review_text": "During my visit to India earlier in the year, I regrettably developed bleeding and agonising pain inside my cheeks. As I was staying at the Bangalore Hilton, I visited a local dentist. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and the doctor was curt and suspected I had developed Gingivitis because of the braces I was on. Given that I have always maintained excellent oral hygiene I wasn\u2019t convinced with his viewpoints and wanted a second opinion.  \n\nOut of desperation and in pursuit of a good dentist, I took a leap of faith and Searched on Practo. Based on the excellent feedbacks and 5 star reviews about Dr Archana at Dental Trendz, I trusted my instinct and visited her. She struck me as a young but experienced dentist. After what seemed like a comprehensive assessment; she explained that there was extensive soft tissue damage, swelling and bleeding due to the protruding arch wires from the braces. She explained the process as she continued to meticulously work on the wires. The doctor was very patient and delicately moved the wires that were sticking out. Dr Archana also reassured that the sores are a common occurrence with the braces and suggested some simple remedies. The appointment with the doctor went off without a hitch and undeniably Dr Archana was professional, caring and kind. Even the treatment was inexpensively priced. \n\nThe rest of my stay was pleasant, enjoyable and memorable.\n\nAt a time when I felt helpless and the chances of finding a good dentist seemed bleak, almost like \u201cBuilding Castles in Spain\u201d; Dr Archana came to my rescue like a guardian angel. I came to realise good dentists are few and far between but Dr Archana certainly is one of them and a beacon of hope. Thanks to Practo and reviewers\u2019 feedback for helping me find a brilliant and astute Dentist who I\u2019d highly recommend. My braces are off and I don\u2019t have to hide my smile as I now have a perfect one!!\n",

                "review_text": "I consulted Dr Archana at Dental Trendz following a recommendation from my neighbour, Mr Satish. I was disconcerted by the excruciating toothache. After a thorough examination Dr Archana informed the tooth was severely decayed and needed to be removed. As I hadn\u2019t eaten or slept for two days because of the agonizing pain, I requested for it to be  done pronto, the same day! After evaluation and perusal of my medical records,she concluded she couldn\u2019t proceed safely due to high risk of bleeding as I was on anticoagulant medication and asked my permission to discuss with my Hospital Physician.\n\nAfter getting the green light from my physician, Dr Archana proceeded to carry out the extraction. It almost felt like a pain free procedure. After cautiously stitching the area, she reiterated the risks, provided information on after care and advised me to contact her if there was a problem and also advised me to access the hospital emergency services if the bleeding was profuse. \n\nUnfortunately I panicked as I started to bleed the next morning and contacted Dr Archana. She requested me to come to her clinic straight away although it was an hour and a half before her actual opening time. After another thorough examination, she reassured me it was unlikely to have a serious consequence but it\u2019s prudent to repeat the blood tests and consult my Physician as a precautionary measure. In fact Dr Archana herself spoke to the Hospital and managed to get an urgent appointment for me. I remember Dr Archana making frequent phone calls on the day whilst I was anxiously waiting at the hospital , to check if I was ok. Thankfully the blood results were normal and bleeding had stopped and the pain also had completely subsided. \n\nI had lost all hopes as I believed it was beyond redemption but I have subsequently had a dental implant in place at Dental Trendz with no complications and I\u2019m also frequently being reviewed by Dr Archana. I am extremely delighted with the results and I would like to thank Dr Archana for her flexibility, patience, humbleness, sympathy, decorum, meticulousness and the incredible help, support, clinical skills and outstanding five-star treatment. I wish we had more doctors like her. I truly am indebted to you Dr Archana. You\u2019re one in a million!!",

But for the last 4 years Dr Archana has been our family dentist and we feel so amazingly lucky to have known her. We relocated to Sanjaynagar 2 years ago but we are so comfortable with Dr A that we are even happy to travel the long distance to see her for treatment. \n\nDoctor is confident and an absolutely brilliant dentist. Very kind, warm, gentle, unhurried and treats patients with utmost dignity and respect. She\u2019s always smiling which certainly helps with our anxieties. Reasonable priced, easily available and offers great treatment advice. Always involves patients in the treatment decisions. So happy with the results and I have always come away with a big smile. I\u2019ll happily recommend Dr Archana to everybody. Thank you doctor for the endless hours you had to work on my teeth. You do such an amazing job and you always go above and beyond.",

Dr Archana  and I discussed and decided together the best course of treatment. \n\nI was completely blown away by Dr Archana's kindness, thoroughness, patience, expertise, hospitableness and professionalism. I was a little antsy, seeking constant reassurance but Dr Archana put me at ease and very patiently explained as she went along. Surprisingly at no time did I feel any pain or discomfort. I had no reason to remonstrate with the doctor as everything was done artistically to perfection.\n\nI can only speak nothing but highly of Dr Archana. I thought there was no salvation at all but with Dr Archana's exemplary, aesthetically focused approach and excellent standard of treatment, I'm absolutely chuffed with the results.\n\nI have absolute confidence in Dr Archana and she has transformed the way I see dentists. Fees were quite reasonable and seemed excellent value for moneey. Dental Trendz certainly deserves a 5 star and I have no qualms or hesitation in recommending Dr Archana and Dental Trendz.",

She has also treated adult members of my family basis my recommendation and their feedback has been positive. These experiences prompted me to seek help for my toddler who had developed a cavity in one of her molars, and when the good doctor confirmed that she treats small children as well, I took the earliest appointment that was available. I was a little worried about the impact on my little one and wanted it to be as positive as possible, as it was her first visit to a dentist and would be both the benchmark for future visits and would create an impression that she would carry for a long time. I need not have worried - Dr. Archana immediately put my child at ease by speaking to her calmly while simultaneously explaining the procedure she was doing - my child is quite communicative/perceptive, so this worked really well. \n\nThe cavity filling went off without a hitch (as it had on previous occasions) and the doctor displayed a great deal of patience while interacting with my daughter. This resulted in the child getting the best possible initiation into the world of dental check-ups - she now not only is very careful about dental hygiene, but will probably look forward to future visits/check-ups. Given that young children are very demanding patients, this reflects quite well on Dr. Archana's abilities.\n\nI haven't provided feedback on my previous experiences of treatment from Dr. Archana because, while really good, that's what I would expect from a professional. This instance, on the other hand, was very personal as it involved my child, and the Doctor really came through and hence I thought of posting this feedback. Would happily recommend 10/10.",
