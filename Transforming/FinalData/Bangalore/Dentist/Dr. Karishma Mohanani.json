Dr. Karishma and her team saved my teeth with the utmost professionalism and care. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance of the office was inviting and calming, setting the tone for a positive experience.\n\nThe procedure I underwent was handled with precision and expertise, leaving me thoroughly impressed. Not only was the service top-notch, but it was also excellent value fr money.\n\nWhat truly sets Dental Canvas apart is the personal connection I made with Dr. Karishma. She didn't just perform the procedure; she guided me through every step of the journey, making me feel like a friend rather than just a patient. Her genuine care and warmth made the entire experience more comfortable and reassuring.\n\nAnd to top it all off, I was pleasantly surprised when Dr. Karishma and her team remembered my birthday during a routine checkup. The small gesture made me feel truly valued as a patient and speaks volumes about the level of personalized care provided at Dental Canvas.\n\nI highly recommend Dental Canvas to anyone in search of exceptional dental care in a welcoming environment. Thank you, Dr. Karishma, and the team at Dental Canvas, for exceeding my expectations and giving me a reason to smile confidently again!",

I liked how they laid my options clearly with the risks involved. They took time to discuss with their lab about my treatment, and showed me a trial alignment before starting with my treatment. I liked their step by step approach, compassion and concern. It was like they were personally involved in my well being.

Had my root canal and crown by Dr. Karishma - she was excellent, explained the pros and cons very well and performed the procedure with great attention to detail and very positive outcomes. She showed me the cavity of my tooth on the screen using a camera in my mouth. She even took an xray and explained to me where the infection was. I was highly satisfied with the amount of time she spent in explaining the procedure, the need for it and making sure that I understand .Thank you very much and highly recommended!",

Dr. Karishma and her team saved my teeth with the utmost professionalism and care. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance of the office was inviting and calming, setting the tone for a positive experience.\n\nThe procedure I underwent was handled with precision and expertise, leaving me thoroughly impressed. Not only was the service top-notch, but it was also excellent value fr money.\n\nWhat truly sets Dental Canvas apart is the personal connection I made with Dr. Karishma. She didn't just perform the procedure; she guided me through every step of the journey, making me feel like a friend rather than just a patient. Her genuine care and warmth made the entire experience more comfortable and reassuring.\n\nAnd to top it all off, I was pleasantly surprised when Dr. Karishma and her team remembered my birthday during a routine checkup. The small gesture made me feel truly valued as a patient and speaks volumes about the level of personalized care provided at Dental Canvas.\n\nI highly recommend Dental Canvas to anyone in search of exceptional dental care in a welcoming environment. Thank you, Dr. Karishma, and the team at Dental Canvas, for exceeding my expectations and giving me a reason to smile confidently again!",

She saved my tooth from a root canal and even did some sealant on other teeth so they dont get spoiled further.She is very patient, kind, and always has time for her patients. There are never any uncomfortable moments with her and she makes sure to answer any questions that you may have. Her clinic is also very clean and puts me at ease whenever I come in for an appointment. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a dentist who really cares about their well-being.",

Most clinics suggested me for braces or aligners. Dr. Karishma patiently heard my needs and concerns, and the team tried to formulate a plan to straighten my teeth with veneers and caps. I liked how they laid my options clearly with the risks involved. They took time to discuss with their lab about my treatment, and showed me a trial alignment before starting with my treatment. I liked their step by step approach, compassion and concern. It was like they were personally involved in my well being. I definitely recommend Dr. Karishma and her clinic Dental Canvas to everyone.",

I never wanted to go to a dentist coz i didnt want to hear how i dont take care of cleaning my teeth. Last week i got too much pain and ended up going to dr karishma's clinic. \nIt was like she knew exactly what to do... didnt lose any time asked me whats wrong. Gave me a painkiller and called the specialist in front of me. She even kept the clinic open when the specialist got late.\nTooth was pulled out quickly she checked again on the xray if it was out fully.\nI had maybe a small swelling which went away in a day.\nIve been to other dentists before who just give lectures and tell to come on another day after giving medicines. Dr Karishma has a no-nonsense approach and got the job done.",
