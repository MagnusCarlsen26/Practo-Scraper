"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Pediatric Tooth Extraction,Pediatric Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I recently accompanied my mother to Dr.Shilpa’s dental clinic, and I am delighted to share our exceptional experience. 

Dr. Shilpa took time to listen attentively to my mother's concerns, thoroughly explaining the necessary procedures and treatment options, as my mother is very scared about any dental issues and this time she had to go through root canal treatment for two teeth. Doctor’s gentle and patient approach truly put my mother at ease, alleviating any dental anxiety she had. 

What sets Dr. Shilpa apart is her exceptional level of care and empathy for her patients. She went above and beyond to make my mother feel comfortable, taking the time to explain each step of the procedure in a way she could easily understand. Her gentle demeanor and reassuring nature created a trusting and supportive environment, which was invaluable to my mother's overall experience. The same great experience earlier also I had when Dr.Shilpa did dental care for my 5 yr old son.

I must also commend the friendly and helpful staff at the clinic. The receptionists were welcoming and accommodating, ensuring smooth appointment scheduling and assisting with any administrative needs. 

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Shilpa for exceptional dental care, particularly for those seeking a compassionate and gentle approach. Dr. Shilpa’s expertise, professionalism, and genuine care for their patients truly exceeded our expectations. My mother's and son’s dental journey was made comfortable and stress-free, and we are grateful for the exceptional service we received.

Really shocked and surprised as it was not my first RCT.
But really the pain was gone forever , within a week my crown was also placed and all is fine now after a month also.
My honest feedback is I have got myself treated for dental problems with almost a dozen dental centres, corporate chains etc and even have got multiple root canals and crowns done.

Utmost care is given based on patient problems and treatment advised.
