I only experienced minor pains when anesthesia was being injected, that too for a short duration. Nothing during or after surgery. Things were well managed and my planted grafts are growing.__\n\nAlso, the clinic shares the main contact number where I have got almost immediate responses for all my queries post the procedure. There are NO CHARGES for any consultation before (Yes!) or after the transplants. I have pinged for a number of queries regarding my earlier ayurvedic medicine and supplements/ ointments, his medicines, side effects, other brand medicines, interactions etc. I have got satisfactory responses every time both in calls and WhatsApp.__\n\nI recommend this clinic to everyone.",

Things were well managed and my planted grafts are growing.__\n\nAlso, the clinic shares the main contact number where I have got almost immediate responses for all my queries post the procedure. There are NO CHARGES for any consultation before (Yes!) or after the transplants. I have pinged for a number of queries regarding my earlier ayurvedic medicine and supplements/ ointments, his medicines, side effects, other brand medicines, interactions etc. I have got satisfactory responses every time both in calls and WhatsApp.__\n\nI recommend this clinic to everyone.",
