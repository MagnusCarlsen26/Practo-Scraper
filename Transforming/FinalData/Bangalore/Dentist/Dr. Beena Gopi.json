She was kind enough to fit me in between her busy schedule. I had to undergo a RCT and couple of fillings, which I thought the price would be out of my budget, but it was very affordable and at the same time she made sure I dont go through a lot of pain during the treatment. She knows her work and explains it very well. l. I would highly recommend anyone for dental care.\nThanks once again Dr Beena.",

She was kind enough to fit me in between her busy schedule. I had to undergo a RCT and couple of fillings, which I thought the price would be out of my budget, but it was very affordable and at the same time she made sure I dont go through a lot of pain during the treatment. She knows her work and explains it very well. l. I would highly recommend anyone for dental care.\nThanks once again Dr Beena.",
