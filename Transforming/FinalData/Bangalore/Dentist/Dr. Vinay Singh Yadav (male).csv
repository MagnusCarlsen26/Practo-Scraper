,,0,0,YES,"I had met with an accident and lost two of my teeth. Dr Vinay was a consultant doctor in the hospital where I was admitted. I must say that it was luck by chance that I met Dr Vinay there. First of all took a bold decision to redo all the facial stitches as soon as he saw my condition. 
From there on, Dr. Vinay started to guide me step by step on the entire course of treatments to be done. I started meeting him at his clinic V.K dental clinic.

Dr Vinay suggested that i had to undergo implant surgery. Dr Vinay is very knowledgeable in his field and very confident at his decisions. Dr.Vinay and Dr.Keerthana explained the entire course of treatment, care-abouts and post procedural implications very well. There wasn't anything that went out of the way. The surgery was a bit complicated considering my specific case, but Dr.Vinay did his best to ensure it to be successful. Even the cost break-up was very well defined and also Dr.Vinay tried his maximum save the cost wherever possible.
