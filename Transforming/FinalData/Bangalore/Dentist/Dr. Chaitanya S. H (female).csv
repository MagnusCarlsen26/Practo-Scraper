"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Treatment,Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Dr Chaitanya saved my teeth and I can't thank her enough. She was a angel disguised as a dentist.
When I went to her I was in severe pain and the infection was so bad that I almost collapsed . Due to lockdown I had to wait and even went to a neighbourhood dentist (I'm still shuddering at what she did) & Clove dental ( who made it even worse)  and after bad cust service at clove decided to visit Chaitanya for the first time after a close friend referred her to me.
She is an amazing dentist and not money monided unlike some I have visited in the past.
The infection was so severe that my face had swollen up. She patiently and hyginically has been treating me last couple of weeks ( 3 fillings and 2 RCT) 
I would prefer her to anyone and everyone. She's an amazing dentist . Surely one of the best on east side  of Bangalore.  If there was a 5 star rating I would give her 6.
Her clinic is so clean and spotless and the place and equipment santitzed we were so amazed at the cleanliness and hygiene of the place. 
How I wish more doctors would be like her. 
I am a big fan of Dr Chaitanya for life . I owe her all my leftover teeth.
Thank you doctor. I am able to finally able to smile with your help. 
If you are looking for a dentist who will take care Of you and will actually help you get your smile back then pls go to her
