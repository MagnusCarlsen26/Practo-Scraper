"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pediatric Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I have visited Dr. Bobby thrice for my 6-7 year old daughter. So, you can imagine how a child at this age is 'mostly' scared to visit a doctor and especially in a situation where there is tooth extraction involved. To describe the problem: My daughter's milk tooth don't fall themselves even at their highest mobility and need external influence. Hence, here we go to Dr. Bobby! I highly recommend her whether it is for a child or an adult, for a number of reasons.
1. She is very quick in responding to either a message or a phone call. There's hardly a waiting time looking for a response from her.
2. She gives you the flexibility of choice of your time slot, in the morning or the noon. She considers your convenience..
3. She makes the child feel very comfortable and waits patientfully for the child to co-operate. 
4. She has great listening skills and ability to understand exactly what you want. Then she explains what is needed to be done and then proceeds with the treatment. She also explains what has to be followed post the treatment.
5. My child did not hesitate or cry even once when we had to take her to Dr. Bobby's clinic for the 2nd and the 3rd instance. She makes a great positive impact with her soft voice and great handling of the situation, on the child's memory!
6. Understanding the child's phsychology they treat the child with those things that children treasure the most.. whether it is a star on the hand for being brave or the tooth 'box' necklace that they give if the child wants to treasure the tooth/teeth for the tooth fairy! I mean my child won't trade any of these that she got from Dr. Bobby for anything in this world ;-)
7. The waiting time in the clinic is very less. Even when there is a queue, the speed with which the team works there is great. So, you hardly feel the wait time if any..
8. The clinic is well maintained and neat.
9. I wish I knew the names of the other supporting doctors in her clininc. They are very helpful and ready to support any time.
10. The location of the clinic is very easy to get to. Being right on the 100 feet main road, you can spot it easily next to Girias, Indiranagar. This is definitely one of the main concerns many people have - hence it is worth while to mention it - might help some body some day.
