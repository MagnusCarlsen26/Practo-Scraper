Dr. Mridula seems to be a very kind and gentle doctor. but she mentioned she is the undergraduate aesthetician and not an orthodontist. The main doctor was on leave. I was looking forward to a consultation regarding braces and also get my teeth cleaned but, I could only get cleaning done and had less deposit so it was a super-quick procedure. review: I would rate 6/10 for the experience over all. since I was charged 1500 rs. (standard) for a quick cleaning process (took at the most less than 30 mins as I had less deposits). Also, I have stain left on my front teeth gap and there's nothing I can do about it until my next cleaning session. But, Dr. Mridula was very patient and sweet on explaining whatever info she could provide on braces and my other concerns. so 10/10 for her personality.  ",

Dr. Mridula seems to be a very kind and gentle doctor. but she mentioned she is the undergraduate aesthetician and not an orthodontist. The main doctor was on leave. I was looking forward to a consultation regarding braces and also get my teeth cleaned but, I could only get cleaning done and had less deposit so it was a super-quick procedure. review: I would rate 6/10 for the experience over all. since I was charged 1500 rs. (standard) for a quick cleaning process (took at the most less than 30 mins as I had less deposits). Also, I have stain left on my front teeth gap and there's nothing I can do about it until my next cleaning session. But, Dr. Mridula was very patient and sweet on explaining whatever info she could provide on braces and my other concerns. so 10/10 for her personality.  ",
