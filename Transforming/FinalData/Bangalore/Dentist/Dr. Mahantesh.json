After visiting several dentists without success, I was finally referred to Dr. Mahantesh at Smile Care Orthodontic Center in HSR by a friend.From the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was impressed by the hygienic environment and the availability of parking. Dr. Mahantesh conducted a comprehensive examination using digital X-rays and identified the issues with my teeth. He patiently explained the treatment plan, which included braces to correct the misalignment and dental work to fix the broken teeth.The process of getting braces was smooth, and the regular adjustment visits were scheduled in a timely manner. Dr. Mahantesh and his team made sure I was comfortable throughout the treatment, and their commitment to customer satisfaction was evident in every interaction.In addition to the braces, Dr. Mahantesh also performed the Root Canal & Crown dental work to repair my broken teeth. The procedures were carried out with great skill and care, ensuring that I experienced minimal pain and discomfort.What impressed me the most was the cost of the treatment. Compared to other clinics I had visited, Smile Care Orthodontic Center and Multi Speciality Dental Clinic offered very competitive prices without compromising on the quality of care.Thanks to Dr. Mahantesh and his team, I now have a beautiful, healthy smile. I strongly recommend Dr. Mahantesh and Smile Care Orthodontic Center and Multi Speciality Dental Clinic to anyone in need of orthodontic or dental treatment. Their expertise, compassion, and dedication to customer satisfaction are truly commendable.In short:1. Actually cares about you2. Scheduled appointment regularly.3. Staff is top notch4.

Prior to this I had consulted a few other Doctors for the same treatment and found them very expensive compared to here. I got the best treatment at a very reasonable price.I had been to Smile Care HSR for treatment of Wisdom  tooth extraction which was a bit complex surgery as my tooth was aligned side wards with muscle growth which made this treatment tough. Dr Mahantesh checked and explained to me the process and suggested his friend Dr Harshini for the treatment who is a Dental Surgeon. I took the appointment and got the surgery done by Dr Harshini. She was very experienced and gentle while getting the tooth extracted made sure I had minimal pain during the extraction. I really appreciate her expertise and treatment. Really very happy and satisfied.. Keep up the Good work guys kudos..",

I went through multiple dentist and finally I was referred by my friend about Dr. MAHANTESH. He examined my teeth and took digital X-ray and found my wisdom tooth was horizontal coming out and due to that my right lower teeth was attack by cavity. He advised me for scaling of my teeth, RCT of right lower teeth '7' and removal of lower left wisdom teeth. First I went for scaling of my teeth and post scaling I found bleeding of my gums stopped and bad breath issue was resolved. And the RCT was done in just 3 sittings. And removal of lower left tooth was done my surgical. I was afraid of RCT and Removal of wisdom tooth but here it went really smooth and painless. Post RCT, ceramic crown was fixed and now I do not have any oral problem. Also my brother had uneven tooth so we had to use braces for his tooth. Braces installation was very smooth and regular visit for adjustment was also arranged in timing manner. Cost : Compared to other clinics is very minimum. Pre and Post treatment briefing was very clear so there is no fear of treatment. Ambience : parking available, hygiene is very well maintained. I strongly recommend Dr.Mahantesh for any dental treatments.

After visiting several dentists without success, I was finally referred to Dr. Mahantesh at Smile Care Orthodontic Center in HSR by a friend.From the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was impressed by the hygienic environment and the availability of parking. Dr. Mahantesh conducted a comprehensive examination using digital X-rays and identified the issues with my teeth. He patiently explained the treatment plan, which included braces to correct the misalignment and dental work to fix the broken teeth.The process of getting braces was smooth, and the regular adjustment visits were scheduled in a timely manner. Dr. Mahantesh and his team made sure I was comfortable throughout the treatment, and their commitment to customer satisfaction was evident in every interaction.In addition to the braces, Dr. Mahantesh also performed the Root Canal & Crown dental work to repair my broken teeth. The procedures were carried out with great skill and care, ensuring that I experienced minimal pain and discomfort.What impressed me the most was the cost of the treatment. Compared to other clinics I had visited, Smile Care Orthodontic Center and Multi Speciality Dental Clinic offered very competitive prices without compromising on the quality of care.Thanks to Dr. Mahantesh and his team, I now have a beautiful, healthy smile. I strongly recommend Dr. Mahantesh and Smile Care Orthodontic Center and Multi Speciality Dental Clinic to anyone in need of orthodontic or dental treatment. Their expertise, compassion, and dedication to customer satisfaction are truly commendable.In short:1. Actually cares about you2. Scheduled appointment regularly.3. Staff is top notch4.

Prior to this I had consulted a few other Doctors for the same treatment and found them very expensive compared to here. I got the best treatment at a very reasonable price.I had been to Smile Care HSR for treatment of Wisdom  tooth extraction which was a bit complex surgery as my tooth was aligned side wards with muscle growth which made this treatment tough. Dr Mahantesh checked and explained to me the process and suggested his friend Dr Harshini for the treatment who is a Dental Surgeon. I took the appointment and got the surgery done by Dr Harshini. She was very experienced and gentle while getting the tooth extracted made sure I had minimal pain during the extraction. I really appreciate her expertise and treatment. Really very happy and satisfied.. Keep up the Good work guys kudos..",

I went through multiple dentist and finally I was referred by my friend about Dr. MAHANTESH. He examined my teeth and took digital X-ray and found my wisdom tooth was horizontal coming out and due to that my right lower teeth was attack by cavity. He advised me for scaling of my teeth, RCT of right lower teeth '7' and removal of lower left wisdom teeth. First I went for scaling of my teeth and post scaling I found bleeding of my gums stopped and bad breath issue was resolved. And the RCT was done in just 3 sittings. And removal of lower left tooth was done my surgical. I was afraid of RCT and Removal of wisdom tooth but here it went really smooth and painless. Post RCT, ceramic crown was fixed and now I do not have any oral problem. Also my brother had uneven tooth so we had to use braces for his tooth. Braces installation was very smooth and regular visit for adjustment was also arranged in timing manner. Cost : Compared to other clinics is very minimum. Pre and Post treatment briefing was very clear so there is no fear of treatment. Ambience : parking available, hygiene is very well maintained. I strongly recommend Dr.Mahantesh for any dental treatments.

He was very kind in doing an evaluation and telling me the approximate timeline for braces and all the different price brackets available for braces of various kinds. I went with the invisible ceramic ones which were also very affordable, and have been visiting him every month. He schedules an appointment via Practo every month with an exact time of visit, and has been patiently working through my teeth while also explaining the changes every time which is very helpful to know. He is never in a rush and even after my complete payment, was ensuring enough time passes for my teeth, with the required appointments, to make sure that my teeth are all set. Fast forward to today, my braces are off and I haven't been happier with my teeth. Just such a great experience throughout! Would also love to mention how helpful the staff at the clinic are too, who also very kindly explain things and ensure you are at ease. Highly recommended.",

I went through multiple dentist and finally I was referred by my friend about Dr. MAHANTESH. He examined my teeth and took digital X-ray and found my wisdom tooth was horizontal coming out and due to that my right lower teeth was attack by cavity. He advised me for scaling of my teeth, RCT of right lower teeth '7' and removal of lower left wisdom teeth. First I went for scaling of my teeth and post scaling I found bleeding of my gums stopped and bad breath issue was resolved. And the RCT was done in just 3 sittings. And removal of lower left tooth was done my surgical. I was afraid of RCT and Removal of wisdom tooth but here it went really smooth and painless. Post RCT, ceramic crown was fixed and now I do not have any oral problem. Also my brother had uneven tooth so we had to use braces for his tooth. Braces installation was very smooth and regular visit for adjustment was also arranged in timing manner. Cost : Compared to other clinics is very minimum. Pre and Post treatment briefing was very clear so there is no fear of treatment. Ambience : parking available, hygiene is very well maintained. I strongly recommend Dr.Mahantesh for any dental treatments.

When I visited for the first time, I was a bit confused and not sure whether braces is the right choice for me and if yes, which ones shall I choose. Dr. Mahantesh explained me the use cases and helped me choosing the best one for me. After his suggestion I chose Damon Clear braces. It was good for me because of very low visibility when smiling, so I do not feel awkward at times in office or among friends. The process was supposed to last around a year. I got my tooth extractions as well (4 teeth, 2 from both sides) for getting the alignment better. For around 8-9 months, I used to have monthly visits for the tightening of the braces and getting it examined. Dr Mahantesh did the treatment very carefully, making sure that the progress is going towards the right direction. From the last 3-4 months, I am having a visit once in 3 weeks for the tightening of braces and changing of the wire. I am facing no issues, Dr. Mahantesh is really experienced and professional in their way of treating. Finally, today I got my braces removed and the results came out really good :) ",

But Dr Mahantesh Sir explained the issues so well with all the props and cons in our 1st visit  and advised to go for damon clear braces .  I felt pretty much confident with his word. So with my believe  I have started my braces journey for upper teeth initially and so far results are really amazing. Because of lower teeth issues doctor had recommended to do flap surgery 1st prior to install braces  for lower teeth. Without any second thought I have done flap surgery. Even though I was really too much nervous and scared to do any kind of surgery, but the doctor and team were so co-operative and approachable,  everything was so cool and smooth so far.  I definitely recommend Doctor Mahantesh Sir as one stop solution for any kind of dental  issues. He is too expert in his profession .",

Even after the treatment teeth weren't aligned properly and to get the extra space during the treatment , they had filed few teeth's enamel beyond the accepted limit which was causing sensitivity after the treatment was over . \n\nSo I have decided to go for the treatment second time with some other better orthodontist and found Dr.Mahantesh Sir in the Practo search . Now it's been close to year with the second treatment and teeth are in better alignment . Still some finishing needs to be done but I can say this time the treatment went extremely good . \n\nHe is down to earth , approachable and a friendly person . I would definitely recommend him for the folks who are looking out for the orthodontic treatment with best results !! ******* ** *** * ** ** * ******* ************ *** tries his best to do the justice .. :) ..

His patients records and history are maintained very rigorously. I was very impressed with the due diligence he does and total care taken while providing the right solution needed for the situation. Had gone for aligner treatment also done during the treatment and found his technique to be very smooth. I was terrified while it started my fears were laid to rest by the end of it and I experienced a near painless aligner procedure . Really happy with the treatment and service received. The clinic is also maintained extremely well keeping all hygiene aspects in mind. Will highly recommend this clinic to anyone who is looking for an effective and professional treatment.",

Dr. Mahantesh did the initial check up and suggested that it would take around 12 months to get the desired results. Also the pricess are very reasonable. The entire team made sure you\u2019re comfortable at all time. Dr. Mahantesh is one of the very patient Orthodontists I\u2019ve ever seen. All scheduled and timely appointments fabricated according to my availability made it much easier to never miss a seating. After 12 months, I am very happy with the results. Got the braces removed and have my temporary retainers period going on for the next 8 months as advised. A must visit dental clinic for all your dental problems. Kudos to the team!",

I was hesitant first on how will the treatment be carried on if I have issues and I am not in India. But the Aligners are perfect answer for such orthodontic treatments. Sometimes there are minor issues with the design, but the service is really good that the team sends the spare pairs of Aligners and ships them to Netherlands in my case. So I never had a set back being abroad. Would really recommend this treatment and the Dr. Mahentesh. He explains all the necessary steps needed to continue the treatment smoothly and without any issues.",

Previously i had braces done at other place but after 3 years the gap started widening again. Dr.Mahantesh told me the cause being the extra tissue, and explained required treatment .I got the allignment done through metallic braces and got a frenectomy for excision of the tissue.  After around 6 months of treatment, my gap is totally closed and i have the desired set of teeth. Dr.Mahantesh is  extremely professional and considerate towards his patients. The very moment he saw my teeth he knew what treatment was required that speaks so much of his experience. Would definitely recommend him for any Dental issues.",

Waiting for the next steps to fix the crown on implant.So far the experience is very good. Other doctors at the clinic are also very friendly. I took my mother for wisdom tooth removal and it was painless experience for her as well.I highly recommend Smile Care for any dental related problem.",

I approached a few other clinics before but none of them highlighted that my lower teeth alignment has been creating gaps between upper teeth. I was given braces for 18 months and I'm totally satisfied with the result - on retainers now. Throughout this period, there were regular appointments and the doctor was always available and very approachable too. He answers any number of questions patiently. I will definitely recommend him if you're planning to get orthodontic treatment. The treatment will take its own sweet time but you gotta trust him and never miss appointments - if you understand simple mechanics, the doctor adjusts the braces aiming a particular alignment for your next appointment. If you miss that, you would end up with unwanted alignment which will only extend the duration of treatment.",

This was my major fear for starting the treatment earlier and some friends told you will get head ache after extracting the teeth. But Doctor helped to clarify these things before starting the treatment and teeth extraction and alignment process was really smooth. I did not experienced any head ache after that.\n\nI started the treatment at my age of 24. Now it is been one and half year my teeth properly aligned and gives more confidence to me personally.\n\nThank you Dr.Mahantesh for helping me out.",

The best thing about Dr. Mahantesh are that he is very patient and listens to your concerns, he's also very prompt and flexible.  Dr. Mahantesh gives you an honest assessment of what is possible and what isn't. I would definitely recommend him to my family and friends considering orthodontic treatment. ",

Would recommend always check charges with Dr. MAHANTESH as he is very genuine and understanding guy. If I think of consult next time, I feel would be happy to visit him...should you go or not.... So My suggestion is... if anyone needs genuine treatment and charges do consider meeting him he provides all the explaination of treatment before treatment starts .it could be great. my rating is  5.
