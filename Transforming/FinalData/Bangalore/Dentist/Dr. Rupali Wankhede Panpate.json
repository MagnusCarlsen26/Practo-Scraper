Honestly I was looking for a dentist close to my home so that I could make multiple visits easily, if required. A quick Google map search, and I figured that not only is Dr. Rupali's clinic closest to my home, its even the one with the highest rated reviews.\n\nDr. Rupali is very warm and approachable. She listened to my case and inspected my tooth. Next she brings up a piece of paper and illustrates my tooth, the issue and the options to fix it. She tells me the two options, the pros and cons and which is cost effective. \n\nDr. Rupali is methodical in her approach and ensures that he team adheres to her instructions. Before starting the procedure, she tells me in case I feel pain or discomfort to alert her and she will administer anaesthesia. However throughout the procedure I did not feel any pain and the whole procedure completed without any discomfort. Dr. Rupali is very patient and ensured the reconstruction was done perfectly. My session lasted for half an hour and I felt like I got my natural tooth back.\n\nOne point worth mentioning is that I had been to the clinic with my seven year old daughter. Dr Rupali made sure my daughter sat in the doctor's cabin during my procedure rather than the waiting lobby. This goes to show her compassion and presence of mind. I'm really thankful to Dr. Rupali's service and would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone requiring an experienced dentist for effective treatment. Thank you Dr. Rupali!",

I have so much dental work that I needed to do and I was ignoring it because it was so overwhelming for me. When I made my first appointment with Dr. Rupali, I explained the reason behind why I have waited so long to be seen. Dr. Rupali was so understanding and discussed all options with me and not only told me what she was planning, but took the time to educate me about all the problems I had and the reason behind it. Also, she is so gentle and I did not feel any pain or discomfort . I am truly seeing the light at the end of the tunnel now with all my dental work. Also, her dental hygienist were amazing!\nI've been so pleased with her work that I've recommended him to friends and family.\nOverall, this has been an awesome experience! Thank you Dr. Rupali.\n",

With a fantastic experience, I left the clinic feeling confident I'd made the right choice, based purely on my spouse recommendation. \nI am very happy to receive 10 years of warranty on my dental crown.I highly recommend this practice to patients young and old who like to be informed of the treatments they're receiving and being treated like a person, not a number. \n\nDon\u2019t bother looking any further!!

When I had a visit to the clinic, I was explained in detail what is the root cause and how it can be resolved. The doctor explained that I has periodontitis issue and it was recommended to have a Dental Surgery. The clinic is well equipped and also specialists visited for recommendation. My Dental Surgery as done by a Periodontal Specialist. Days later I had a speedy recovery. Followed by the Surgery, I was also having a zigzag arrangement of teeth which was enhancing the plaque deposition. When asked how to resolve this issue, the doctor explained the process and also made prototype models to explain how it will look after correction. The doctor termed this as Smile Design. This was performed by Extraction, Root Canal followed placement of Bridge. After years, I feel that I can smile freely (previously, as the front teeth were zigzag I was not comfortable to have a wide smile). I acknowledge the doctor for kind of guidance and treatment. Also, a lots of respect for the knowledge and experience in handling the treatment.  Thanks to the doctor for giving me a confident Smile :-)",

Honestly I was looking for a dentist close to my home so that I could make multiple visits easily, if required. A quick Google map search, and I figured that not only is Dr. Rupali's clinic closest to my home, its even the one with the highest rated reviews.\n\nDr. Rupali is very warm and approachable. She listened to my case and inspected my tooth. Next she brings up a piece of paper and illustrates my tooth, the issue and the options to fix it. She tells me the two options, the pros and cons and which is cost effective. \n\nDr. Rupali is methodical in her approach and ensures that he team adheres to her instructions. Before starting the procedure, she tells me in case I feel pain or discomfort to alert her and she will administer anaesthesia. However throughout the procedure I did not feel any pain and the whole procedure completed without any discomfort. Dr. Rupali is very patient and ensured the reconstruction was done perfectly. My session lasted for half an hour and I felt like I got my natural tooth back.\n\nOne point worth mentioning is that I had been to the clinic with my seven year old daughter. Dr Rupali made sure my daughter sat in the doctor's cabin during my procedure rather than the waiting lobby. This goes to show her compassion and presence of mind. I'm really thankful to Dr. Rupali's service and would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone requiring an experienced dentist for effective treatment. Thank you Dr. Rupali!",

I have so much dental work that I needed to do and I was ignoring it because it was so overwhelming for me. When I made my first appointment with Dr. Rupali, I explained the reason behind why I have waited so long to be seen. Dr. Rupali was so understanding and discussed all options with me and not only told me what she was planning, but took the time to educate me about all the problems I had and the reason behind it. Also, she is so gentle and I did not feel any pain or discomfort . I am truly seeing the light at the end of the tunnel now with all my dental work. Also, her dental hygienist were amazing!\nI've been so pleased with her work that I've recommended him to friends and family.\nOverall, this has been an awesome experience! Thank you Dr. Rupali.\n",

With a fantastic experience, I left the clinic feeling confident I'd made the right choice, based purely on my spouse recommendation. \nI am very happy to receive 10 years of warranty on my dental crown.I highly recommend this practice to patients young and old who like to be informed of the treatments they're receiving and being treated like a person, not a number. \n\nDon\u2019t bother looking any further!!

When I had a visit to the clinic, I was explained in detail what is the root cause and how it can be resolved. The doctor explained that I has periodontitis issue and it was recommended to have a Dental Surgery. The clinic is well equipped and also specialists visited for recommendation. My Dental Surgery as done by a Periodontal Specialist. Days later I had a speedy recovery. Followed by the Surgery, I was also having a zigzag arrangement of teeth which was enhancing the plaque deposition. When asked how to resolve this issue, the doctor explained the process and also made prototype models to explain how it will look after correction. The doctor termed this as Smile Design. This was performed by Extraction, Root Canal followed placement of Bridge. After years, I feel that I can smile freely (previously, as the front teeth were zigzag I was not comfortable to have a wide smile). I acknowledge the doctor for kind of guidance and treatment. Also, a lots of respect for the knowledge and experience in handling the treatment.  Thanks to the doctor for giving me a confident Smile :-)",
