",2021-05-05 13:55:54,False,False,Vinutha,"Hello Mrs. Vinutha,

Thank you for considering and visiting Credence Dental and taking time out to review us. We would like to address the issues you mentioned in your review.

You visited us due to an emergency dental issue during lock-down. During tele-consultation, you mentioned severe toothache due to a dental procedure of tooth filling, from another dentist a week prior to visiting us. After this, you were asked to visit the clinic with an emergency appointment. During consultation at the clinic, you clearly mentioned that you didn't have a toothache, but a headache. 

With this background, upon examination by our specialist dentist, it was found that the filling was technically appropriate and did not require a refilling, and you didn't have a toothache. This was communicated while you were at the clinic. But, you insisted that we re-do the filling.

We followed all protocols necessary to diagnose you and advise as we did.

With the current lockdown on essential services, filling / re-filling of the tooth is not considered an emergency treatment but an elective treatment, and doing the same would be a malpractice, subjecting the specialist to be penalised. Please do note that you have also signed a consent form saying that you have visited us only for an emergency treatment considering current pandemic.  It is indeed shocking to know that you had your teeth re-filled from another dentist, which is against medical code.  

As a dental clinic, we give utmost care for our patients, and please note that treatment regimen cannot be executed on directives from the patient, on the basis of his/her instincts. We also would like to mention that you were asked not to pay the consultation fee, but you insisted and paid. 

As Doctors, we are trained to give our best for our patients’ treatment, of which the prognosis is a scientific approach based on logic, keeping in mind the patients' future health in mind.

We always make sure to provide the most detailed examination and appropriate treatment to the best standard possible, with a whole overview approach to ensure long term dental health.

Thank you for taking time to review us.

You have visited us during the last week for a second opinion about a gum problem. 

Further to your visit and consultation, we have recommended blood tests and  X-rays for diagnosis, to prescribe further treatment. After your visit, we have consulted with the Periodontal Specialist (screenshot attached) to decide the next course of action for your gum swellings. 

Further to this, we have communicated the specialist opinion later during the evening on the same day(screenshot attached) and had a lengthy conversation about your gum condition and treatment (including the gel). During telephoning conversation, it was conveyed to you that the gum issue if treated now would recur since you are undergoing orthodontic treatment. Which is the main reason that you were prescribed medications and asked for pre-medical tests.

We have noticed that in your review, you have mentioned that you did not receive treatment as you ask of us. Please note that we cannot prescribe treatment as suggested by the patient. Our intent is to provide the right treatment to all our patients. It is not right on your part to force the line of treatment. We follow ethical practices and while doing so, our main intent is to treat the patient and not merely for monetary benefits and you should be appreciative that you benefited from this. If our intent was to make 'direct money', we wouldn't have been upfront with you as we did.

We are hopeful that your treatment goes well and you are relieved from your agony. 

However, you are always welcome to reach out to us and we will treat you with your best interests in mind.
