He did not inform me about payment details in advance even when asked. Tooth extraction was done by some another doctor and not by Dr. Shambulinga. The new doctor after extracting 2 of the 5 teeth said the BP is way too high and we shall first consult a specialist for that.

As expected, the dentist didnt even check with us if we needed the cleaning or filling or something else!\nThe problem was in right tooth and in his excitement he also cleaned the left tooth.\nNow what did he clean on the left side???\nIt was a cavity filling done earlier. So if its a permanent cavity filling, why did he remove it?? Just to fill up again so that he could bill more!!!\n\nThe end of story is, we went with one problem of right side, now we are sitting with pain on both sides!!\nBiggest problem with this doctor is - he doesn't listen *** **** ******* **** ** ****** ******** ",
