Dr. Umesh is one of the very few doctors in the world who wish to see the smile in the face of patients after the treatment instead of the patient\u2019s wallet weight.\nFortunately, we visited Denta Uno Dental and met Mr. Umesh. He has spent a good time with us and cleared all the fears of my wife with his perfect counselling. We have decided to start the treatment. \n\nDr. Umesh is the one and only doctor whom I met in my experience till now, with a great patience and friendliness with patients and ready to spend time with the patient to explain in detail about the treatment, process, provides multiple solutions and informs us the pros and cons of each which help us in taking the right decision. \n\nMore ever Dr. Umesh respects the time of patients. He perfectly follows his appointment schedules, sometimes due to any emergency if any changes are there in the appointment schedules we will get informed in advance by the team. I have seen very few doctors like Dr. Umesh who respects the time of patients also. \n\nComing to the treatment part, the treatment is continued for a number of weeks as Dr. Umesh explained. He is very cautious in minor issues also and never compromises on the quality of the treatment. The clinic is implanted with highly sophisticated equipment and the doctors are highly professional. The hospital competes with hi-level corporate hospitals in giving qualitative treatment with an affordable treatment cost when compared with them. \n\nComing to the treatment cost, Dr. Umesh never hesitates to suggest the best treatment for the patients at their pocket-friendly. He will take good time and explain in details the treatment process and time including the treatment expenses with different available options. He leaves the patients free to make the decision as per their affordable conditions. Whatever the choice of the patient, he never compromises on the quality of the treatment and provides the best treatment as per the choice of the patients. \n\nDr. Umesh is one of the very few doctors in the world who wish to see the smile in the face of patients after the treatment instead of the patient\u2019s wallet weight. \n\nI recommend this dental hospital to anyone who needs great dental care for you and your entire family.\n",

I didn't realise when he finished the local Anaesthesia and then started the digging root canal treatment. I was amazing, I was enjoying treatment till the end and kept busy talking to me very friendly way.\nI am 100% happy now with the treatment and also Dr Umesh educated me to how avoid this in future.\nIt's value for money treatment plus 100% painless in two visits.",

Dr. Umesh is one of the very few doctors in the world who wish to see the smile in the face of patients after the treatment instead of the patient\u2019s wallet weight.\nFortunately, we visited Denta Uno Dental and met Mr. Umesh. He has spent a good time with us and cleared all the fears of my wife with his perfect counselling. We have decided to start the treatment. \n\nDr. Umesh is the one and only doctor whom I met in my experience till now, with a great patience and friendliness with patients and ready to spend time with the patient to explain in detail about the treatment, process, provides multiple solutions and informs us the pros and cons of each which help us in taking the right decision. \n\nMore ever Dr. Umesh respects the time of patients. He perfectly follows his appointment schedules, sometimes due to any emergency if any changes are there in the appointment schedules we will get informed in advance by the team. I have seen very few doctors like Dr. Umesh who respects the time of patients also. \n\nComing to the treatment part, the treatment is continued for a number of weeks as Dr. Umesh explained. He is very cautious in minor issues also and never compromises on the quality of the treatment. The clinic is implanted with highly sophisticated equipment and the doctors are highly professional. The hospital competes with hi-level corporate hospitals in giving qualitative treatment with an affordable treatment cost when compared with them. \n\nComing to the treatment cost, Dr. Umesh never hesitates to suggest the best treatment for the patients at their pocket-friendly. He will take good time and explain in details the treatment process and time including the treatment expenses with different available options. He leaves the patients free to make the decision as per their affordable conditions. Whatever the choice of the patient, he never compromises on the quality of the treatment and provides the best treatment as per the choice of the patients. \n\nDr. Umesh is one of the very few doctors in the world who wish to see the smile in the face of patients after the treatment instead of the patient\u2019s wallet weight. \n\nI recommend this dental hospital to anyone who needs great dental care for you and your entire family.\n",

I didn't realise when he finished the local Anaesthesia and then started the digging root canal treatment. I was amazing, I was enjoying treatment till the end and kept busy talking to me very friendly way.\nI am 100% happy now with the treatment and also Dr Umesh educated me to how avoid this in future.\nIt's value for money treatment plus 100% painless in two visits.",

Over the course of next 2 weeks, the work was done wonderfully.\n\nToday there is no pain and the new crowns fit perfectly.\n\nI am very happy.

I visited many dentists in Bangalore in JP Nagar and got varying treatment plan and very high financial cost. But I feel lucky to be referred to Dr Umesh and it was an amazing experience In undergoing treatment under him. RCT, extraction of last molar tooth,  correcting old  caps and putting new crown,all of these procedures were done  without any pain and complications. He is very friendly, polite and explains problems in details. Also the most important thing is that he never advised me to go to unwanted procedures thereby saving me a lot of money. His clinic UNo Dento too is very aesthetic and absolutely organised.\nPost treatment I feel fine wrt my dental problems. \nThanks to Dr Umesh and his assistant Vijaylaxmi, who is also very polite and efficient.",

He explains everything clearly, and gives you options, as well as educated explanations of each. He is also very compassionate. You can tell he really cares for his patients and how they are feeling during the entire procedure.\nRight from the moment I walked into the clinic, everyone that I interacted with was amazing.\nI will definitely be coming back, and referring everyone I know to this place!",
