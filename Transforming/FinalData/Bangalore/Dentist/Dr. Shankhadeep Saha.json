Removed a massive tooth growing in the wrong direction which could've been bad for me in the long run. He also did my fillings but went above and beyond ONCE AGAIN and hooked me up white fillings instead of all that silver ruining my mouth! WHAT A GUY!! Highly recommend him and his staff!

Doctor fully explained the procedure and was very good at doing the treatment. He is a well experienced professional doctor. To be frank I was very much frightened before take the treatment, but doctor game me sometime to relax during the treatment and he even made sure I was not feeling the pain during the treatment. I recommend this doctor 100% to everyone who is very scared of teeth extraction or treatment of decayed teeth. Loved the experience and this is my honest review. Do visit.",

Even after my RCT procedure, he has followed up diligently and that makes me feel extremely assured of his service as a well-learned dentist .
