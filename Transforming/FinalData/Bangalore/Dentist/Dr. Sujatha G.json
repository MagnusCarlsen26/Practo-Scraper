I was too scared to go for a treatment since the other Dentists who I consulted, stated that the extraction of wisdom tooth is very complicated and may require jaw bone surgery if required; additionally, they were also charging me a fortune for the extraction. I finally re-visited Partha Dental Clinic in Jayanagar ( my first visit was last year for a dental bridge fixture) and was delighted to see Dr. Sujatha who had treated me earlier. She was very friendly and also remembered me very well. After my dental check-up and X-ray, she offered to treat it immediately (I was taken aback as I was prepared a for a couple of visits to and fro to the dental clinic with the experience from other dentists). She explained the entire procedure and made me  comfortable before the treatment.  I received a very painless and prompt treatment on the same day for the expense as less as half of what I was quoted by other dental clinics. I strongly recommend Dr. Sujatha for any dental issues.",

Many of them are certified professionals who are money minded and do not have any sense of patient's well being* *** ** ******** *** ******* ** *** *** **** ****** ********* * **** **** ****  Her calm demenaour and approach make her an ideal healthcare professional leader in her domain. \nFIrst of all she made me at ease despite of having fear in dental settings. She thouroughly inspected and did an extraordinary findings which other dentists over the year failed to notice ****  ***** ***** *** *** ****** ******** * **** **** *** *** ******** ** *****  She clearly explained the findings in layman terms and gave alot of great tips to control the problem. I really felt valued with her as a dental patient, because she doesn't have a egoistic attitude of some medial professionals  who think they are superior and patients are inferior. She spoke professionally and at the same time maintained her friendly approach.\nI wish all doctors could learn from Dr. Sujatha  about how to treat patients !!! . I really wish Dr . Sujatha best wishes in her endevours and looking forward to meet her again and definitely recommend her to all my family and acquaintances :)",

I was too scared to go for a treatment since the other Dentists who I consulted, stated that the extraction of wisdom tooth is very complicated and may require jaw bone surgery if required; additionally, they were also charging me a fortune for the extraction. I finally re-visited Partha Dental Clinic in Jayanagar ( my first visit was last year for a dental bridge fixture) and was delighted to see Dr. Sujatha who had treated me earlier. She was very friendly and also remembered me very well. After my dental check-up and X-ray, she offered to treat it immediately (I was taken aback as I was prepared a for a couple of visits to and fro to the dental clinic with the experience from other dentists). She explained the entire procedure and made me  comfortable before the treatment.  I received a very painless and prompt treatment on the same day for the expense as less as half of what I was quoted by other dental clinics. I strongly recommend Dr. Sujatha for any dental issues.",

                "review_text": "I was looking for dental clinics in my neighbourhood for my gum issues and one fine afternoon i visited partha clinic. I am glad that i did, because i had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Sujatha.  I have been to many dentists over the years. Many of them are certified professionals who are money minded and do not have any sense of patient's well being* *** ** ******** *** ******* ** *** *** **** ****** ********* * **** **** ****  Her calm demenaour and approach make her an ideal healthcare professional leader in her domain. \nFIrst of all she made me at ease despite of having fear in dental settings. She thouroughly inspected and did an extraordinary findings which other dentists over the year failed to notice ****  ***** ***** *** *** ****** ******** * **** **** *** *** ******** ** *****  She clearly explained the findings in layman terms and gave alot of great tips to control the problem. I really felt valued with her as a dental patient, because she doesn't have a egoistic attitude of some medial professionals  who think they are superior and patients are inferior. She spoke professionally and at the same time maintained her friendly approach.\nI wish all doctors could learn from Dr. Sujatha  about how to treat patients !!! . I really wish Dr . Sujatha best wishes in her endevours and looking forward to meet her again and definitely recommend her to all my family and acquaintances :)",
