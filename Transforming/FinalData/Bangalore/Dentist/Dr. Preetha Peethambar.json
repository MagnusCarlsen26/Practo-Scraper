She explained the entire thing in a nice way and did the procedure in a very professional manner.

My wife was really in shock on listening to that from that doctor who also showed x rats to prove her point.As soon as we met Preetha, she saw and told nothing to worry, root canal definitely not required.... She explained us everything for more than half an hour and took away all our worries.I would recommend her to everyone.. Her experience is unmatchable.Thank you doctor. ",
