She was down to earth simple and fast. The medicine she gave me was excellent though i am not a doctor but my family relations are doctors 1 dentist and others or in other field MBBS and MD but the way Dr. Shradha Das treated me systamaticly was really nice I felt homely touch. People take money or they say this this this should be done in other places and the root cause is left behind. I ask God to bless the work of her hands. I went to many places all experts but I just took her advice and just started 1 dose of medicine it was such a relef. I will surely recomand her to many who needs a dentist. I still have treatment to be undergo. Actually I wanted to thank her when I meet her next but this will be the best way. This is my experience  and like others who reads it to know and try Dr. Shradha and experience what I experience a relief and perfect a systematic treatment.  God bless all those who read this.",

She also explained all the steps that will be involved with the option I chose. While performing the extraction as well while filling up the cavities, she was very gentle and took utmost care to keep the procedure as less painful as possible. All the issues were addressed in 2 sittings and I recovered completely in 3 days. Cheers!!",

She was down to earth simple and fast. The medicine she gave me was excellent though i am not a doctor but my family relations are doctors 1 dentist and others or in other field MBBS and MD but the way Dr. Shradha Das treated me systamaticly was really nice I felt homely touch. People take money or they say this this this should be done in other places and the root cause is left behind. I ask God to bless the work of her hands. I went to many places all experts but I just took her advice and just started 1 dose of medicine it was such a relef. I will surely recomand her to many who needs a dentist. I still have treatment to be undergo. Actually I wanted to thank her when I meet her next but this will be the best way.
