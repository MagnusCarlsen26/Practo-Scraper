I hardly waited for few minutes and Dr.Dimple arrived. She too made me comfortable and was too friendly, asked all my situations and heard me carefully. After which she examined my mouth and tooth condition,using x-ray. She found out that my upper wisdom tooth was the culprit and was causing me unbearable pain. So she prescribed the medication and suggested to go for wisdom tooth extraction, she fixed the appointment with another surgeon for next the day. I visited again for the scheduled appointment and met Dr.Kiran. Even, Dr. Kiran was too humble,friendly , profesional and down to earth. I was afraid as I had no one to bring along with me but everyone made me so comfortable and friendly that i didn't needed anyone . I must say Dr. Dimple is not just an awesome dentist but a very humble soul too :) Even the staffs are too good and helpful:) It was an awesome experience and I would highly recommend Citrus Dental, Practo to the users. I wish all the best to Dr. Dimple and her staffs in making it big and last but not the least thanks a lot for fixing my issues \ud83d\ude07\u2764\ufe0f",

I visited Citrus Dental to give it a go after doing some prelim research on web, the proximity was also a reason. However, after my first visit I was totally convinced about it. Inconsulted with Dr. Dimple who was really calm in hearing my problem before sharing her advise, along with different options to go forward along with their pro-cons. I was really impressed to hear this part, as now a days most clinics we hear about how the costliest one is more beneficial. Later on, i enrolled myself for a RCT (root canal) on doctors advice and based on my suitability doctor allocated me convenient appointment slots. I had a RCT experience previously, hence really loved the flexibility part as I had to get this done amid office trip and household chores. Later I also got cap done on my RCTed tooth, and even here her detailed consultation was very helpful (and educative on same time). Apart from visits, she was caring enough to check the condition of the treated tooth at regular interval, which is fantastic considering most places its like \"visit us if any problem\" approach. She is really considerate about others time, hence kind of always punctual on scheduled appointment timeframes, that helped greatly. Highly recommend her for any dental consultation or process.",

I had a great visit and the doctor\u2019s demeanor has really put me at ease so I highly recommend this clinic. Citrus Dental. Further, to add I had also taken my father-in-law to the doctor for severe dental pain across 4 teeths, she had extracted the 3 teeth causing issue to the pain with ease, really happy with the way the things moved, highly recommended for the dental related issues. Now I think I really don\u2019t have to wander here and there for dental issue as she is our family doctor.",

I hardly waited for few minutes and Dr.Dimple arrived. She too made me comfortable and was too friendly, asked all my situations and heard me carefully. After which she examined my mouth and tooth condition,using x-ray. She found out that my upper wisdom tooth was the culprit and was causing me unbearable pain. So she prescribed the medication and suggested to go for wisdom tooth extraction, she fixed the appointment with another surgeon for next the day. I visited again for the scheduled appointment and met Dr.Kiran. Even, Dr. Kiran was too humble,friendly , profesional and down to earth. I was afraid as I had no one to bring along with me but everyone made me so comfortable and friendly that i didn't needed anyone . I must say Dr. Dimple is not just an awesome dentist but a very humble soul too :) Even the staffs are too good and helpful:) It was an awesome experience and I would highly recommend Citrus Dental, Practo to the users. I wish all the best to Dr. Dimple and her staffs in making it big and last but not the least thanks a lot for fixing my issues \ud83d\ude07\u2764\ufe0f",

I visited Citrus Dental to give it a go after doing some prelim research on web, the proximity was also a reason. However, after my first visit I was totally convinced about it. Inconsulted with Dr. Dimple who was really calm in hearing my problem before sharing her advise, along with different options to go forward along with their pro-cons. I was really impressed to hear this part, as now a days most clinics we hear about how the costliest one is more beneficial. Later on, i enrolled myself for a RCT (root canal) on doctors advice and based on my suitability doctor allocated me convenient appointment slots. I had a RCT experience previously, hence really loved the flexibility part as I had to get this done amid office trip and household chores. Later I also got cap done on my RCTed tooth, and even here her detailed consultation was very helpful (and educative on same time). Apart from visits, she was caring enough to check the condition of the treated tooth at regular interval, which is fantastic considering most places its like \"visit us if any problem\" approach. She is really considerate about others time, hence kind of always punctual on scheduled appointment timeframes, that helped greatly. Highly recommend her for any dental consultation or process.",

I especially loved how Dr. DImple really took her time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options. I had a great visit and the doctor\u2019s demeanor has really put me at ease so I highly recommend this clinic. Citrus Dental. Further, to add I had also taken my father-in-law to the doctor for severe dental pain across 4 teeths, she had extracted the 3 teeth causing issue to the pain with ease, really happy with the way the things moved, highly recommended for the dental related issues. Now I think I really don\u2019t have to wander here and there for dental issue as she is our family doctor.",

Along with this, Dr. Dimple ensured that we don't have to shell out any additional expense than what is really required.  This is an aspect I'd like to strongly appreciate & highlight here.

Recently I have taken Root canal treatment from her and it has been truly a great experience. Both the Doctor and her assistant has been very calm and polite during my entire treatment. For Root Canal generally it requires 3-4 visit with a gap of at least 1-2 days per visit so Dr. Dimple has always asked for my convenient date and time and has been very punctual. My wife has also taken her treatment in the past and Dr. Dimple has done an excellent job replacing her old fillings and improving her gums. I have complete confidence in her abilities to quickly perform only the work necessary and minimize all discomfort. My overall dental treatment has been very satisfying and I would definitely recommend everyone to consult with her for their all Dental problems!! ",
