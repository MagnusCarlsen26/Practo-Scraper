,,0,0,YES,"True appreciation to Dr Sanjana & Evershine Dental Clinic, generally there is a perception among public that going to clinic never a good experience, very mute and grumpy staffs and not very welcoming, but the team at Evershine Dental Clinic changing the perception but is changing slowly and my our personal experience with Dr Sanjana K Sreenivasan & her team right from the booking appointment, they made my 6 year old daughter comfortable, keeping her engaged, keeping her informed on what she is going to do at every step, follow-up calls, post treatment checkup, very friendly helped her to go through the treatment in a fun way. Got through their details through Practo & Google , now i feel it was a good decision and fun filled Dental Treatment, Kudos to Dr Arathi Nair and support staff tooI would recommend this team for your Dental clinic needs",2023-01-15 10:00:28,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
