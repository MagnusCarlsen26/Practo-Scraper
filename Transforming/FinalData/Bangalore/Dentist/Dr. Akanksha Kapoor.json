She explained me everything about the procedure. I am a kind of person who asks too much questions, but she clears all my doubts calmly. Even for the cap measurement and teeth shade matching she specially called lab person. Apart from that she gives proper appointment timing so that patient should not have to wait for long duration. She gave me some discount as well :)\n\nWill surely recommend everyone to just visit there for any dental related problems\n\nThank You Very Much Dr Akansha",

She also gave me a few examples where patients have not followed her instructions and the consequences. Less number of medicines suggested by the doctor which did not have any side effects. I had followed exactly what she had recommended and i was out of pain within a week as she predicted i would.",

She was very considerate and helpful throughout the procedure. I finally have a good frontline after the treatment within 10 days. I'm very happy with the result and Dr.Akansha is always ready to help and I would definitely recommend you to go here.",

                "review_text": "I visited Dr.Akansha Kapoor for tooth ache and was diagnosed I had to go for RCT as the cavity was way too deep, she ensured the same by taking a couple of X-Rays. She explains the issue at hand and also recommends the solution for a long run. I was really scared initially but the doctor made me so comfortable that I really felt this to be a pain less procedure, I liked the fact that the doctor personally called me to check if there was any issue / pain after the initial procedure was done. Prompt follow ups without any delays or waiting time.My husband as well has been treated by this doctor and he is also very happy with the services offered here.I personally recommend Dr.Akansha for any sort of dental issues.Kudos to her extreme patience and dedication.!!!

Suggested, what needs to be done and carried out the procedure which lasted around 4-5 sittings. Per sitting took mostly half an hour. All sittings for treatment were totally hassle free and doctor made me feel comfortable by regularly asking for any pain or discomfort during treatment. Post treatment there's no issues so far. Highly satisfied and thankful for doctor's service. Will highly recommended everyone to avail the services.",

She explained me everything about the procedure. I am a kind of person who asks too much questions, but she clears all my doubts calmly. Even for the cap measurement and teeth shade matching she specially called lab person. Apart from that she gives proper appointment timing so that patient should not have to wait for long duration. She gave me some discount as well :)\n\nWill surely recommend everyone to just visit there for any dental related problems\n\nThank You Very Much Dr Akansha",

Unlike other Dental clinics i visited the center has all the facilities built in like X-ray. The doctors there are very friendly and made me comfortable about the issue and pain during the operation. The operation was totally painless. The best part about Dr. Akanksha was that, post extraction she made me aware of all the precautions that need to be taken. She also gave me a few examples where patients have not followed her instructions and the consequences. Less number of medicines suggested by the doctor which did not have any side effects. I had followed exactly what she had recommended and i was out of pain within a week as she predicted i would.",

Dr. Akansha is very friendly, lets you know the root cause of your problem, explains everything clearly and the treatment is excellent. I had crooked front teeth and I wanted a painless and fast procedure as I had a time constraint. Dr. Akansha suggested a few alternatives and I chose to go with dental crowns. She was very considerate and helpful throughout the procedure. I finally have a good frontline after the treatment within 10 days. I'm very happy with the result and Dr.Akansha is always ready to help and I would definitely recommend you to go here.",

The doctor explained the problem to us in detail and advised the course of treatment and then laid out a clear plan of action.

The clinic is very neat and clean, well organised and I could see it getting sanitized after every patient. The doctor manages her appointments so efficiently that we never had to wait in the clinic. I am glad that I chose this clinic for my mothers treatment.",

Suggested, what needs to be done and carried out the procedure which lasted around 4-5 sittings. Per sitting took mostly half an hour. All sittings for treatment were totally hassle free and doctor made me feel comfortable by regularly asking for any pain or discomfort during treatment. Post treatment there's no issues so far. Highly satisfied and thankful for doctor's service. Will highly recommended everyone to avail the services.",

But the doctor explained the whole process and explained extensively every step of the process.\n\nShe even followed up with mom quite a number of times on the pain levels, comfort etc. as we had to visit 4 times for the Root canal to get completed.\n\nWould highly recommend to anyone looking for a dentist around here.

It was painless procedure and I had to take just one pain killer.

I was a little worried because in this pandemic situation your nose and mouth should be masked when you are outside but dental problems can't be solved without removing the mask. But the doctor showed his lab and how all the equipments are sanitizing after seeing all that I had no hesitation about it.\n\nThe one thing I really liked about Dr. Akanksha, she is very friendly even for small doubts she will not hesitate to explain you (over phone as well).\nThank you doctor for all the help.\n\n",

The best part of her treatment - which I could easily figure out - is that she tries to give a personal touch to the patient. \n\nThank you Doctor for making my visits so comfortable! I can't say that I hope to visit you again since I don't want to get any teeth problems in the future! Would love to go for check ups though - with the hope that nothing is wrong with my teeth!! :)\n\nRegards \nSaurabh ",
