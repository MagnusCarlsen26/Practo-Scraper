"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Oral Lesions Screening,",0,0,YES,"A year ago, my wife began experiencing mouth ulcers, which made it difficult for her to eat spicy food and enjoy meals. Despite consulting nearly seven doctors, her condition did not improve.
Thankfully, we were referred to Dr. Srinivas a month ago. He listened to her symptoms attentively and suggested conducting a biopsy. Within three days, the results confirmed that she had Oral Lichen Planus. Dr. Srinivas prescribed a course of medication, and to our surprise, within just 25 days, her condition had reduced by 70%. Now, after consistent treatment, her condition has improved by 95%, and she can enjoy spicy food once again.
We are immensely grateful to Dr. Srinivas for his exceptional care and expertise. His treatment has significantly improved my wife's quality of life, and we highly recommend him to anyone facing similar issues.
