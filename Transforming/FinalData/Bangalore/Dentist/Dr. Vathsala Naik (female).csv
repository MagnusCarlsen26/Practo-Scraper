"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I met with Dr. Vathsala after seeing a number of other dentists in the city for a severe periodontal infection which required my front tooth to be removed. I had extensive bone damage because of which no doctor was ready to do an implant even with bone graft.  Everyone suggested bridge which means scrapping off the perfectly fine adjacent two teeth for support. I was devastated after every doctor visit and then luckily came by Dr. Vathsala. Dr. Vathsala saw my scans and she told me I should continue to seek more opinion while she herself gets opinion from others. She got back to me in a day as promised and told me what I needed to hear. An implant was possible with bone graft but that the procedure will be expensive, healing will take a lot of time, and there are no guarantees. That's all I needed to hear, that there was indeed a chance that this might succeed. One year and multiple procedures later, I have an implant. My adjacent two teeth have been spared. It's worth every penny.  Dr. Vathsala is very kind, always smiling, easy to talk to, and makes sure you get the best possible options for your condition. I'm glad to have met her.
