To err is human, but we do not hesitate to correct any of our errors (if any) with patients comfort, energy, time and money in mind.
Your complaints from the beginning were headache, neck pain and jaw discomfort unrelated to the current implants/ prosthesis.
You had already consulted other Dentists (for a second opinion) and got it certified from them, that the implant treatment was well and was good (as described by you). 
Even your Neurologist had given you clearance that your symptoms are NOT because of the Dental Implants.
Your treating Maxillofacial Prosthodontist and Implantologist has done a fine job and never was in doubt regarding the prosthesis. However, since you desired a change in Prosthesis he had given you various alternate treatment options.
