I had a cavity for a very long time (6 years) which finally went deep enough to into the root and started to pain.  Dr. Kavitha suggested root canal treatment and that it would take between two to three sittings. It took two sittings for root canal and one more sitting for fixing the crown. The treatment was totally pain free (no pain even after the local anaesthesia stopped working). She ensured that the crown fits perfectly. Now I don't even feel like I have a crown in my mouth. I am very satisfied with the treatment.",

                "reply_text": "\u00a0months ago\n\nI read through your comments and I firmly refute the allegations made by you. Your mother had come to me for a consultation in Oct; I remember it well as your sister had undergone her treatment for orthodontic braces with me for the past two years.\nI tried reaching out to you after seeing your comments. Since you did not respond to my attempts to contact you, I am clarifying my stance here. In your review you failed to mention few things and have falsified certain details which I would like to highlight here for the people reading this.\n1. Your mother was referred to me by an ENT specialist as a case of lymph node swelling in her neck. After two weeks of the ENT doctor having treated her, since the swelling did not subside, the ENT specialist wanted the opinion of a dentist to rule out any dental issues causing it. Your mother was alone when she visited me; your father joined her later after I had treated her.\n2. As part of my examination, upon taking an X-ray of the infected area, I noticed that she had root stumps of her lower and upper wisdom teeth. The root stumps of her lower wisdom tooth showed chronic inflammation. Do note that these were \u2018root stumps\u2019 and not \u2018teeth\u2019 as you have alleged in your comment. The infection in the root stump that the X-ray showed up could be a possible cause for the swelling seen in her lymph node. I explained the same to your mother. Also, since it was only a matter of time before the infected root stumps cause pain, it made sense to extract the root stumps. I discussed this first with the ENT doctor who had referred her to me. And later, I had a discussion with my oral surgeon as well. After discussing with them, given the situation at hand, finally, I suggested removal of root stumps as the best course of action as this would rule out the infected root stumps being a causative factor for the swelling of the lymph nodes. The X-ray is still with me, If you care for a more detailed explanation for the suggested course of treatment, do drop in at my clinic and I will explain it.\n3. Only after clearly explaining to your mother the rationale behind removing the infected root stumps and on her explicit agreement, did I extract the root stumps. I refute your allegation that I forced your mother to undergo the treatment.\n4. After the treatment was completed, until when she was alone, I explained the post extract instructions to your mother. A while later, your father joined and he questioned me on the necessity to remove the root stumps, which I explained to him in detail. To him as well, twice, I explained the post extraction instructions. Your accusation that I threw her out of the clinic without post care instructions is totally wrong and baseless. (If you drop in at the clinic, I can show you relevant CCTV footage).\n5. In deciding the course of treatment, I followed the rule of omission and helped to rule out dental related issues as the causative factor. Any doctor with an ounce of medical knowledge won\u2019t refute this.\n6. I have followed professional ethics and placed my patient\u2019s welfare as my highest priority in all of my 25 years of service. I stand firmly by my decision and treatment which I did to your mother.\n\n",

She had a swelling in the lymph node of her neck which could have been due to a slight rot in her bottom molar tooth but another dentist she had visited had said it was a very minor chance. However, my mother went to Dr. Kavitha for a second opinion. Dr. Kavitha insisted on extracting the tooth even though she could have done without it for a few months. It was nothing urgent. \n\nAfter getting an X ray done, Dr. Kavitha insisted that one of the upper molars also had an infection, something the other dentist had not diagnosed. She forced my mother to get two teeth extracted then and there in spite of already suffering from horrible pain in her neck. She was unsympathetic and was very impatient, clearly forcing my mother, a person already in pain, to undergo two needless tooth extractions. \n\nMy mother was in tears and horrible pain after this and the doctor pretty much threw her out of the clinic without even explaining post-extraction care properly. *** ******* *** ** *** *** *** ****** **** *** ** ***** ** ******** *** *** *******. \n\n****** *** **** ** ** ******** **** *** ********* ** ** *** ** * ***** **** ********** ** ********** ** *** ********** ******** ****** *** ***** ******* *** ******* ***** *** ***** ********** **** ******* ** ******* ************** **** ***** *** ********** ** **** *** *** ******* ** **** *** *** ******* **** *****\n\n",

                "reply_text": "I assume you are referring to a crown placement on your lower pre molar tooth for which I had done a root canal treatment.  As is the case with any product, there are different qualities of crowns that can be used to cover your tooth after root canal treatment.  There are ones which come without any warranty and ones that come with warranty of 5/10 years.  In your case you had opted for the one without warranty due to the price difference.  The crown is made of ceramic and is susceptible to breakage/chipping depending on the kind of food that the patient consumes.  When a patient consumes hard food, eg. chicken/mutton bones etc., it is likely to break or chip; which has probably happened in your case.  The guarantee for the crowns come from the manufacturer.   We, dentists, cannot give a guarantee on the longevity of the crown because it entirely depends on how the patient uses it.\n\nI did promise a guarantee of five years, but that was for the root canal treatment which was done by me and I still stand by it.\n\nMoreover the point that you have made mentioning that the other crown that you fixed from a different doctor is not damaged is also incorrect.  When you had visited me on your very first consultation about a year and half back, I had showed you that the existing crown, adjacent to the one which I was about to treat had chipped off too.  And for the same reason, had suggested that you go for the crown with warranty, which you did not opt for.  \n\nThe above points were made amply clear to you at the time of your first consultation.  \n\nI have provided similar ceramic crowns that do not have a guarantee to many of my patients in my service of 20+years.  I haven't had a case where any of my patients came back with breakage/chipping within a short span of two years; unless they have tried chewing very hard food as mentioned above.\n\nAll treatments done by me are transparent and adhering to the ethics of my profession.  None of my actions are done with any mala fide intention.",

I had a cavity for a very long time (6 years) which finally went deep enough to into the root and started to pain.  Dr. Kavitha suggested root canal treatment and that it would take between two to three sittings. It took two sittings for root canal and one more sitting for fixing the crown. The treatment was totally pain free (no pain even after the local anaesthesia stopped working). She ensured that the crown fits perfectly. Now I don't even feel like I have a crown in my mouth. I am very satisfied with the treatment.",

                "reply_text": "\u00a0months ago\n\nI read through your comments and I firmly refute the allegations made by you. Your mother had come to me for a consultation in Oct; I remember it well as your sister had undergone her treatment for orthodontic braces with me for the past two years.\nI tried reaching out to you after seeing your comments. Since you did not respond to my attempts to contact you, I am clarifying my stance here. In your review you failed to mention few things and have falsified certain details which I would like to highlight here for the people reading this.\n1. Your mother was referred to me by an ENT specialist as a case of lymph node swelling in her neck. After two weeks of the ENT doctor having treated her, since the swelling did not subside, the ENT specialist wanted the opinion of a dentist to rule out any dental issues causing it. Your mother was alone when she visited me; your father joined her later after I had treated her.\n2. As part of my examination, upon taking an X-ray of the infected area, I noticed that she had root stumps of her lower and upper wisdom teeth. The root stumps of her lower wisdom tooth showed chronic inflammation. Do note that these were \u2018root stumps\u2019 and not \u2018teeth\u2019 as you have alleged in your comment. The infection in the root stump that the X-ray showed up could be a possible cause for the swelling seen in her lymph node. I explained the same to your mother. Also, since it was only a matter of time before the infected root stumps cause pain, it made sense to extract the root stumps. I discussed this first with the ENT doctor who had referred her to me. And later, I had a discussion with my oral surgeon as well. After discussing with them, given the situation at hand, finally, I suggested removal of root stumps as the best course of action as this would rule out the infected root stumps being a causative factor for the swelling of the lymph nodes. The X-ray is still with me, If you care for a more detailed explanation for the suggested course of treatment, do drop in at my clinic and I will explain it.\n3. Only after clearly explaining to your mother the rationale behind removing the infected root stumps and on her explicit agreement, did I extract the root stumps. I refute your allegation that I forced your mother to undergo the treatment.\n4. After the treatment was completed, until when she was alone, I explained the post extract instructions to your mother. A while later, your father joined and he questioned me on the necessity to remove the root stumps, which I explained to him in detail. To him as well, twice, I explained the post extraction instructions. Your accusation that I threw her out of the clinic without post care instructions is totally wrong and baseless. (If you drop in at the clinic, I can show you relevant CCTV footage).\n5. In deciding the course of treatment, I followed the rule of omission and helped to rule out dental related issues as the causative factor. Any doctor with an ounce of medical knowledge won\u2019t refute this.\n6. I have followed professional ethics and placed my patient\u2019s welfare as my highest priority in all of my 25 years of service. I stand firmly by my decision and treatment which I did to your mother.\n\n",

She had a swelling in the lymph node of her neck which could have been due to a slight rot in her bottom molar tooth but another dentist she had visited had said it was a very minor chance. However, my mother went to Dr. Kavitha for a second opinion. Dr. Kavitha insisted on extracting the tooth even though she could have done without it for a few months. It was nothing urgent. \n\nAfter getting an X ray done, Dr. Kavitha insisted that one of the upper molars also had an infection, something the other dentist had not diagnosed. She forced my mother to get two teeth extracted then and there in spite of already suffering from horrible pain in her neck. She was unsympathetic and was very impatient, clearly forcing my mother, a person already in pain, to undergo two needless tooth extractions. \n\nMy mother was in tears and horrible pain after this and the doctor pretty much threw her out of the clinic without even explaining post-extraction care properly. *** ******* *** ** *** *** *** ****** **** *** ** ***** ** ******** *** *** *******. \n\n****** *** **** ** ** ******** **** *** ********* ** ** *** ** * ***** **** ********** ** ********** ** *** ********** ******** ****** *** ***** ******* *** ******* ***** *** ***** ********** **** ******* ** ******* ************** **** ***** *** ********** ** **** *** *** ******* ** **** *** *** ******* **** *****\n\n",

                "reply_text": "I assume you are referring to a crown placement on your lower pre molar tooth for which I had done a root canal treatment.  As is the case with any product, there are different qualities of crowns that can be used to cover your tooth after root canal treatment.  There are ones which come without any warranty and ones that come with warranty of 5/10 years.  In your case you had opted for the one without warranty due to the price difference.  The crown is made of ceramic and is susceptible to breakage/chipping depending on the kind of food that the patient consumes.  When a patient consumes hard food, eg. chicken/mutton bones etc., it is likely to break or chip; which has probably happened in your case.  The guarantee for the crowns come from the manufacturer.   We, dentists, cannot give a guarantee on the longevity of the crown because it entirely depends on how the patient uses it.\n\nI did promise a guarantee of five years, but that was for the root canal treatment which was done by me and I still stand by it.\n\nMoreover the point that you have made mentioning that the other crown that you fixed from a different doctor is not damaged is also incorrect.  When you had visited me on your very first consultation about a year and half back, I had showed you that the existing crown, adjacent to the one which I was about to treat had chipped off too.  And for the same reason, had suggested that you go for the crown with warranty, which you did not opt for.  \n\nThe above points were made amply clear to you at the time of your first consultation.  \n\nI have provided similar ceramic crowns that do not have a guarantee to many of my patients in my service of 20+years.  I haven't had a case where any of my patients came back with breakage/chipping within a short span of two years; unless they have tried chewing very hard food as mentioned above.\n\nAll treatments done by me are transparent and adhering to the ethics of my profession.  None of my actions are done with any mala fide intention.",
