I am impressed by Sujays approach he is very professional and friendly as well. I felt very comfortable at this place.he has noted down all my problems and possible solutions for that.teeth extraction was done smoothly by his assistant hope the further treatments will be same.",

We are a privately run organisation ,and we dont get funds from third party to do charity.\n2. we have been given a loan at the same rate as any other business.\n3. Government/or Any Institutions has not taken any measures to take care of consultation charges. --Infact you all should put pressure on government to bring in some health schemes.\n4. Each and every thing on this world have been linked to money-even the rice that we eat.so even doctors have to earn their rice.\n6. If you have any DAUGHTER/SON who is in this profession-probably you will understand the amount of mental trauma that we have to undergo to even talk about all this .\nAnd VALUE FOR MONEY,\nfirst of all you should understand our profession is not business, and we are not selling any product like phones, cars... here. so the terminology that you have Quoted as Value for MONEY is  not relevant. by talking all these you people have been bringing the business dimension to this noble profession. even in phones different brands come with different price tag., Different hotels have different price menu, different cars have its own price tag.. like wise different Doctors who has attained skill sets will charge differently....\nSo just dont compare US any other clinics and devalue the quality and efficiency of the Doctors- PLEASE MIND DOCTORS ARE HUMAN BEINGS, NOT MACHINES.\nAt the end i would like to conclude by saying Money is not everything for us, We have to earn money to pay up Our debts and pay the salaries to the 10 families who are associated with our institutions, who are working day and night to give the best quality treatment and to serve our patients efficiently.\nthank you \nJai hind",
