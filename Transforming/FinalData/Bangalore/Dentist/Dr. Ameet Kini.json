Lingual CAD/CAM braces has been helping me in the following ways:\n\n1) Best aesthetics in orthodontic treatment as the braces are completely invisible.\n2) Easy recognition of ongoing teeth treatment by me (amateur and not only just orthodontists) as the braces is totally on the lingual side.\n3) I did not undergo any soreness/ulcer inside my lips unlike with the use of conventional braces. (I only experienced minor ulcer at the back of my tongue, which was immediately taken care by Dr Ameet Kini as he provided the necessary ointment and medication)\n4) Slurry speech (due to braces) was corrected within 4-5 days automatically.\n5) Customized brackets and robot wiring is helping in the teeth movement better than the conventional braces (because of the sophisticated technology used) without compromising on the time lapse as it remains same as conventional braces.\n6) I have been undergoing 4 months of treatment now and a big shout out to Dr Ameet Kini as the results also have been going in the same direction as the results of any other conventional braces.\n\nBut extreme careful maintenance is required as it involves customized brackets for each individual and it requires time to repair/replace in case the bracket is fallen off/broken.\n\nDr Ameet Kini has been extremely professional and friendly, has been helping me out with the smooth treatment and answering all my queries regarding diet, maintenance of oral hygiene and the appliance. The clinic is very hygienic and well maintained. I was very nervous about teeth extraction and the appliance. Dr Ameet Kini took care of it in an extremely smooth way and I did not experience any pain at all (and I finally overcame  the fear of \"The Dentist\") He follows standard procedure and I look forward to every orthodontic appointment. He always follows up on me with immediate responses in case of emergency or even on minute and mundane details.\n\nOverall my ratings are as follows:\n\n1) Dr Ameet Kini - 10/10 \n2) CAD/CAM lingual braces - 10/10 (sophisticated aesthetic braces)\n3) Power Smiles dental clinic and hygiene - 10/10\n4) Explanation of appliance and doctor friendliness- 10/10\n5) Treatment satisfaction - 10/10\n6) Value for money - 8.8/10\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr Ameet Kini and Power Smiles Dental Clinic for CAD/CAM lingual orthodontic treatment!",

He is friendly and approachable and explained the treatment procedure in detail. After 9 months of braces, the teeth are already aligned properly and look good. The steady progress is completely worth it and no permanent teeth were removed. We are happy with the results. \nI highly recommend Dr. Ameet Kini for braces treatment.\n\nThe clinic is clean and hygienic and the staff is polite. \n",

The entire course of the treatment was a smooth one and with absolutely no pain. Dr Ameet was very professional and I must truly say he has got magical hands because not even once was I hurt. He was very courteous and patient enough to listen to all my grievances. In fact he is easily approachable when you need his attention. I\n\nAlso, based on my feedback my wife too consulted him for severe toothache. Dr did not recommend her root canal which we thought was the case before consulting him. The pain has never resurfaced after Dr. Ameet treated her.\n\nI am more than happy with the result of the treatment and I would definitively recommend Dr. Ameet for all your dental treatments. ",

Enough information was collected regarding the patient's current health status. The appointments were well sorted and there were no overlaps, so that there wasn't any waiting time. \n\nWe were thermally screened and disinfected with a disinfectant before being permitted into the premises. The facility was very well sanitized and used air filters and foggers to maintain good air quality.\n\nWe were anxious about the procedure, but Dr. Ameet was very patient with us and spent time trying to understand the problem and calm us down. The staff were very helpful, kind and always available to help. Dr. Ameet is very professional and he took the time to explain what needed to be done and provided valuable advice. It's not easy to find a good dentist for your kids, I highly recommend Dr. Ameet Kini, Dr. Sujatha Ameet for kids as well as adults.",

Lingual CAD/CAM braces has been helping me in the following ways:\n\n1) Best aesthetics in orthodontic treatment as the braces are completely invisible.\n2) Easy recognition of ongoing teeth treatment by me (amateur and not only just orthodontists) as the braces is totally on the lingual side.\n3) I did not undergo any soreness/ulcer inside my lips unlike with the use of conventional braces. (I only experienced minor ulcer at the back of my tongue, which was immediately taken care by Dr Ameet Kini as he provided the necessary ointment and medication)\n4) Slurry speech (due to braces) was corrected within 4-5 days automatically.\n5) Customized brackets and robot wiring is helping in the teeth movement better than the conventional braces (because of the sophisticated technology used) without compromising on the time lapse as it remains same as conventional braces.\n6) I have been undergoing 4 months of treatment now and a big shout out to Dr Ameet Kini as the results also have been going in the same direction as the results of any other conventional braces.\n\nBut extreme careful maintenance is required as it involves customized brackets for each individual and it requires time to repair/replace in case the bracket is fallen off/broken.\n\nDr Ameet Kini has been extremely professional and friendly, has been helping me out with the smooth treatment and answering all my queries regarding diet, maintenance of oral hygiene and the appliance. The clinic is very hygienic and well maintained. I was very nervous about teeth extraction and the appliance. Dr Ameet Kini took care of it in an extremely smooth way and I did not experience any pain at all (and I finally overcame  the fear of \"The Dentist\") He follows standard procedure and I look forward to every orthodontic appointment. He always follows up on me with immediate responses in case of emergency or even on minute and mundane details.\n\nOverall my ratings are as follows:\n\n1) Dr Ameet Kini - 10/10 \n2) CAD/CAM lingual braces - 10/10 (sophisticated aesthetic braces)\n3) Power Smiles dental clinic and hygiene - 10/10\n4) Explanation of appliance and doctor friendliness- 10/10\n5) Treatment satisfaction - 10/10\n6) Value for money - 8.8/10\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr Ameet Kini and Power Smiles Dental Clinic for CAD/CAM lingual orthodontic treatment!",

He is friendly and approachable and explained the treatment procedure in detail. After 9 months of braces, the teeth are already aligned properly and look good. The steady progress is completely worth it and no permanent teeth were removed. We are happy with the results. \nI highly recommend Dr. Ameet Kini for braces treatment.\n\nThe clinic is clean and hygienic and the staff is polite. \n",

I decided to go ahead with putting on the braces. It's been less than an year since I started off and I feel happy to say that my treatment is now 100% complete with perfection. The entire course of the treatment was a smooth one and with absolutely no pain. Dr Ameet was very professional and I must truly say he has got magical hands because not even once was I hurt. He was very courteous and patient enough to listen to all my grievances. In fact he is easily approachable when you need his attention. I\n\nAlso, based on my feedback my wife too consulted him for severe toothache. Dr did not recommend her root canal which we thought was the case before consulting him. The pain has never resurfaced after Dr. Ameet treated her.\n\nI am more than happy with the result of the treatment and I would definitively recommend Dr. Ameet for all your dental treatments. ",

The appointments were well sorted and there were no overlaps, so that there wasn't any waiting time. \n\nWe were thermally screened and disinfected with a disinfectant before being permitted into the premises. The facility was very well sanitized and used air filters and foggers to maintain good air quality.\n\nWe were anxious about the procedure, but Dr. Ameet was very patient with us and spent time trying to understand the problem and calm us down. The staff were very helpful, kind and always available to help. Dr. Ameet is very professional and he took the time to explain what needed to be done and provided valuable advice. It's not easy to find a good dentist for your kids, I highly recommend Dr. Ameet Kini, Dr. Sujatha Ameet for kids as well as adults.",

I was very relieved to know that I didn't have to get any teeth pulled out before starting the treatment. \nDr. Ameet is very patient and honest about answering all questions and doubts and gives a balanced reply so that the patient can take an informed decision. \nHe is very flexible about working around the given time frame to meet the patients needs and priorities.\nI am extremely happy about the way my treatment is going and look forward to having teeth back in shape again!",

At my very first consultation I was quite confident of getting my treatment done by him, thanks to his orthodontic expertise, he was very warm and welcoming, after a through analysis he explained in detail without any rush various options available with their pros and cons, and the best plan of action. During the treatment and monthly visits he ensures that you're comfortable all through and procedures are almost pain free. Dr Ameet is very passionate about his work and adopts some of the best and most advanced method available in the industry. And I must mention when you step into his clinic it doesn't not even for a moment feel like a clinic, it is so hygiene and well maintained you feel good and comfortable. The treatment cost is also reasonable and value M. If you're looking for an orthodontist I would highly recommended Dr Ameet Kini.",

He was friendly and gave me a very comforting and reassuring smile throughout my procedure. It makes a big difference to the patient, in this case me. He is very gentle and did the entire procedure in less than 5 mins and in one go. He instilled confidence in me and that helped me so much during the treatment. He explained everything so patiently till all my queries were answered. He gave me some great tips for my after care. His services are a true value for your money. His clinic is also very well maintained, spacious, extremely extremely clean and very welcoming ambiance. His staff is also very approachable. I had a great experience!

I have called him for issues once before a morning flight and  Dr. Kini readily gave me an appointment at 6:00 am... very few doctors would do that. In terms of the treatment i have experienced tremendous progress and strongly recommend him. The clinic is also very well equipped. and for all the ladies out there Dr. Kini is extremely handsome this is what i over herd from a few patients seated next to me in the waiting  lounge  in my opinion and based on some amout of research Dr. Kini is also very easy on the pocket.

Beyond that he is very patient and listens to you well. You can ask any questions and he\u2019s willing to answer. His work is also really good. I had a couple of fillings done today and I feel comfortable. I\u2019m going for the root canal treatment and have to see how that goes. The pricing is on the higher side of the market in Bangalore but I think you get good value for what you pay. \nThanks. \nAprameya. ",
