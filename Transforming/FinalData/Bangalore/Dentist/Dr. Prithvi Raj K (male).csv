First I want to tell you that there is infection in your tooth which requires RCT and with only antibiotics it won't reduce.. if someone has told with medicine infection will go in dental infection it's upto them.
Regarding the charges it is upto every doctor to fix their charges and will be informed before.. if someone wants not to pay that fee they are not forced to get the treatment. To your knowledge we have only one time registration charges of Rs 300 valid for 1year.. anywhere valid for a week or so..
Last regarding the X ray that day we have some problem with our laptop, which we have given for service.. which is expected to come tomorrow...after that we can send you...
