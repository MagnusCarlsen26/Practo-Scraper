"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,"," Treatment for bleeding/ Swolen Gums,",0,0,YES,"Sujay dental clinic is one of the best clinic I have seen in Bangalore. 
My mother had swollen, bleeding, sensitive gums and it was difficult to even drink cold water as sensitivity was more.

Now my mother's teeth is absolutely fine, gums are strong and perfect.

Dr. Sujay, explain the problem very well, make us understand how they are planning to solve it, how many sitings, what are the charges.

The Doctors in the clinic are technically sound, use latest technologies, have lot of patience, try to understand and explain things, do the work keenly, they will do the best for the long term fix and wellness of teeth.
