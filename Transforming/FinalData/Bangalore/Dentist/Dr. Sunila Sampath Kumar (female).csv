,"Scaling / Polishing,",0,0,NO,"I just reached ten minutes post the appointment. The Doctor Looked very irritated, and blamed me that I was late. She claimed that she called me, but I never received any call. Most importantly she handles teeth very rough and doesn't know any behavior towards patients.. She doesn't bother to make anyone comfortable. Lastly the way she has done scaling, it has affected my gum  on my Lower part. I can surprisingly see gaps, ***** ******* ****** ********* My gums are bleeding badly.. Again she was instructing me that my gums are not healthy where as I have heard from every other doctor that gums are ok and fine.. I am not happy with her methods of scaling.  PeoplePlease think Before turning up to her. It's not worthy.Thank youüôè",2022-06-25 16:48:07,False,False,Sayani Chatterji,"Really sorry to know you felt this way.In your case you had inflamed gums due to calculus deposit inside the gums .when it comes to inflamed  gums during scaling little bleeding tend to happen and nothing to worry about it .after scaling gums will heal very fast.with my 26years of very successful dental practice I could understand your problem very easily.anyway Thank you for your feedback,take care of your gums properly",2022-06-29T09:00:17+0000,Dr. Sunila Sampath Kumar
