Every time I found a new dentist I had to go through what was happening with my teeth and what I needed to relieve the pain and what I wanted my end goal to be. Each and every time I was left feeling unheard to the point that frustration set in. \r\nThe last \"dentist\" I had seen for only one appointment yanked out three of my teeth on the top jaw as he \"knew\" what he wanted to do even if I had explained that my jaw bone had deteriorated and wouldn't support the \"implants\" he had in mind. I even had x-rays which showed him the bone deterioration.  After this appointment I had lost hope and was now walking around with not only really bad teeth but three missing on the side of my mouth which was very unattractive for anybody especially me.  \r\nWhen I went in for my 1st appointment with Dr Pasare I was surprised that he actually listened to what was happening in my mouth, he understood that I had hypersensitive teeth which was coupled with my life long fear and angst of the Dentist. He also knew exactly what we needed to do to achieve the final outcome. Some of my demands were near impossible, however, Dr Pasare accommodated my requests. We would have the best \"Animated Discussions\" in regards to the direction we needed to take. \r\nFinally I was ready to undertake the procedure I desperately needed for health reasons: full dental implants of my top and lower jaw. We began the procedure on 17th April 2015 on my top jaw. Dr Pasare was very supportive throughout the whole procedure and nothing was every a problem. \r\nWe finished the top jaw and the results are unbelievable. \r\nLooking at the before photo's seemed more like a mugshot compared to the finished product. \r\nMy years of suffering in silence and doing everything to avoid smiling are over. \r\nI Highly and Whole Heartily Recommend Dr Pasare to not only listen but hear what you need and then support you through the entire process. \r\nHe was gently throughout the procedure keeping in mind that I would absolutely literally jump every single time a dentist needed to do anything with my teeth. \r\nI know it's crazy, however, I'm really looking forward to starting the procedure on my lower jaw.\r\nForever Grateful that there are still Dental Professionals out there dedicated to really making a Difference to Their Patients Lives\r\nStalin",

They go out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. It's small things that made the difference to me, like offering me water to drink during procedure because I was coughing, asking if I was okay to proceed..explaining what they were doing as they did it,  They pay attention to patient comfort. They did good work.\r\n\r\nAs for the Dentist, I saw Dr.Abhilash because I had an issue with jaw pain. It was persistent and driving me crazy. He explained everything he was going to do, what he was thinking, and took a very gradual approach to addressing the issue. It came down to something very simple. We got to that conclusion because he took his time in speaking with me, doing the easy things first, and not jumping into a costly and unneeded procedure. I appreciate his patience and his thoughtfulness. He gave me teeth guards to wear in the night. They are comfortable. I have worn them at night everyday for about a month, and I notice a significant difference.\r\n\r\nThis is the first dentist that I've ever truly liked. I really feel like this place is focused on doing whats best for the patient as opposed to making money.\r\nLike I said this place is great. You should go here.",

Next to my lower molar there is a gum pocket in which remnants of food get stuck sometimes, as a result there occurs swelling.  I tried hard to convince them them I don't have any pain I just want some solution to get get rid of that pocket. They suggested me tooth extraction.  My tooth is exactly fine and even gum is not that much over grown.  Appointment was booked for next day I deposited 2000 in advance.  I told them in my next visit I have changed my mind  for extraction,  the best part was that they did not forced me or suggested me to go for it,  but asked for my account details  so that they can refund my advance. \n\nOnly thing that I missed was trust there are so many treatments available for gums now a days I was not convinced for tooth extraction,  there was a continuous doubt in my head did they understood my problem cleanly or not. \n\n2 days back I have got my refund.

Basically, he did not want to spend even 30 minutes in trying to answer our questions. I would not recommend him if you expect a more friendly, polite and doctor who would respect the patient. He told us to go and talk to front desk to know about the cost. Why would he not explain us few things which we are interested to know about before we proceed with the treatment. I just wasted\u200b the consultation fees. ",

The Clinic is beautiful, clean and filled with the latest technology. Waiting time was around 15 minutes but worth as doctor was busy.  After checking in my Scan and X-rays  Treatment plan was done, discussed, explained . Trust me Crystal clear before with complete options. No forcing. Given time. That was more important for me.  He was very patient as he explained what needed to be done and what my options were. Implants were planned placed in about an hour time. Almost painless ,comfortable Happy with the way treament has gone till now. to be followed after six months for crowns. Hope for the same level of confidence. Would really recommend this clinic. All i got to know is through our company and our department forum.  Would highly recommend them.",

I saw the Smile and More reviews in Google and Practo and hence visited.Luckily I met Dr. Abhilash .. he also said my oral hygiene was in bad state , but he said that he can fix it. I went with him seeing his confidence. He gave treatment in phased manner and by Gods grace, all my issues are sorted, it took me 6 to 7 months. But I'm thankful to Dr Abhilash for his wonderful approach and being patient with me. though I underwent tough procedures, it was painless.I would highly recommend Dr Abhilash.",

The doctor was friendly and understood my problem. i was advised RCT for the decayed tooth. In the first sitting, it took 2 hrs. approx and temporary filling was done. The infection was also removed and that reduced the pain which i was suffering for last 3-5 days. Next sitting took only 30 min to take the measurements of the tooth cap. I have another sitting in 7 days to do permanent filling and putting the crown/cap. It was almost painless.",

And this for a Tooth that was already half fallen. The clinic quoted a very high amount for the procedure. I paid one tenth and got the tooth extracted in one sitting from another doctor listed in PRACTO. \r\nBasic courtesy was missing which was a bigger issue than the money and lack of expertise.

I'm glad I did.   I appreciate his thorough examination and options for me.  I have a few future dental appointments now, and knew I would, but wanted to find a Dentist that I could trust. This Dentist will speak very clearly and directly to you, one to one and doesnot force anything upon you. If you need a dentist, go here.  You will be treated right.",

Really?? \nI was expecting him to suggest and explain the treatment plan but as he was in a hurry, he said the only suggestion he has for me is full mouth rehabilitation, that's all. I went with a hope and got only disappointment after paying Rs.500 for 5 mins. Will not recommend this place to anyone else. ",

She had been to another dentist recently for teeth cleaning and that dentist had suggested to get 8 tooth fillings saying they had cavities. Naturally we were worried but decided to get a second opinion from another dentist. So we came here. Dr Abhilash checked all the teeth carefully and said most of them were just stains and not cavities and can be removed with teeth cleaning. Imagine our shock and that too after getting cleaning already done with the previous dentist. He removed those stains in 10 minutes and showed us and there was no cavity. \n\nWe again went back to the previous dentist and when we confronted her, all she could say was we heard her wrong. Imagine her audacity. I wanted to write about this on practo that how she is duping people but dont have proof as she dint give a bill.\n\nLesson learnt- Always seek a second opinion when in doubt, and get the treatment plan in writing.

After reading positive reviews on practo I decided to call Smiles n More Dental clinic. I was little skeptical in the beginning as I entered the office, but once I started discussing my issue with Dr Abhilash I was pretty confident. He took time in explaining me all different options and delivered everything as promised. This was the painless visit to Dentist office ever. I am totally satisfied with the service provided by this office and I would certainly recommend them to anyone. Keep up the good work.",

He has done an excellent job in masking my brown discoloured teeth with crowns to give me a white bright smile. \nHe also set right the crooked teeth with the crowns, all in time before my wedding next week.\n\nI was extremely nervous as to whether it will come out nicely or not. Though he always said not to worry, I had my concerns.\n\nIt was a difficult case as I understand but he din't give up or compromise and did his best and did a fantastic job. Thanks also to his assistants and other clinic people.\n\nThis is the best wedding gift I may have received and in return I give him lots of heartfelt gratitude and thanks.",

The doctor who did my consultation and part of my treatment, Dr Abhilash is very professional and enthusiastic. He explained every step in detail and could clear my doubts( I had many). I found this missing in the other 2 places( maybe because they were only trainees). \n  2. The place is clean and well-kept. The tools that were used on me were always packed. Something that was lacking again at the other places.   \n3. I could get appointments conveniently either over phone or by booking online.      \n Cons: 1. I found this clinic little more expensive than the other 2 places. I was told that the quality or company was Biohorizon which is more expensive then other  Korean implants. Yes found true on my googling.",
