The ambiance was calming and kid friendly, and the staff greeted me with warm smiles that set a positive tone for my daughter's treatment journey. Trust me you get everything under one roof. \n\nWe first met Dr Premila Naidu for my daughter teeth issues and she was perfect in explaining what we need to do, what can be done, how the process works  etc. She put us through Dr Neha Singh for further treatment since this needed orthodontist magic.\n\nDr. Neha is not just a dental doctor; she is an artist and a perfectionist. Her approach to fixing braces is meticulous, throughout the process, she explained each step with clarity, making sure we understood the importance of each phase of my daughter's treatment.\n\nThe outcome? Nothing short of miraculous. After her braces were removed, we were greeted by a reflection that beamed back a perfectly aligned set of teeth. The transformation was not just physical; its much beyond. She can now smile without hesitation, and it's all thanks to Dr. Neha's exceptional skill and dedication. Her expertise in orthodontics has given us a great outcome that we will treasure for a lifetime. For anyone considering braces, I cannot recommend Dr. Neha & Small bites enough.\n",

Dr Neha made this happen, every appointment she was on time, cheerful and explained treatment stages in advance, we were always mentally prepared for the next appointment and were looking forward to it The treatment was quite a smooth journey and without much friction. We highly recommend Dr Neha for kids who are looking for a great doctor with safe hands for their dental needs.  We wish her all the very best and continue her efforts to keep children smiling always. with gratitude Ravi and Rishi ",

The ambiance was calming and kid friendly, and the staff greeted me with warm smiles that set a positive tone for my daughter's treatment journey. Trust me you get everything under one roof. \n\nWe first met Dr Premila Naidu for my daughter teeth issues and she was perfect in explaining what we need to do, what can be done, how the process works  etc. She put us through Dr Neha Singh for further treatment since this needed orthodontist magic.\n\nDr. Neha is not just a dental doctor; she is an artist and a perfectionist. Her approach to fixing braces is meticulous, throughout the process, she explained each step with clarity, making sure we understood the importance of each phase of my daughter's treatment.\n\nThe outcome? Nothing short of miraculous. After her braces were removed, we were greeted by a reflection that beamed back a perfectly aligned set of teeth. The transformation was not just physical; its much beyond. She can now smile without hesitation, and it's all thanks to Dr. Neha's exceptional skill and dedication. Her expertise in orthodontics has given us a great outcome that we will treasure for a lifetime. For anyone considering braces, I cannot recommend Dr. Neha & Small bites enough.\n",

Dr Neha made this happen, every appointment she was on time, cheerful and explained treatment stages in advance, we were always mentally prepared for the next appointment and were looking forward to it The treatment was quite a smooth journey and without much friction. We highly recommend Dr Neha for kids who are looking for a great doctor with safe hands for their dental needs.  We wish her all the very best and continue her efforts to keep children smiling always. with gratitude Ravi and Rishi ",

Then due to my work schedule I was traveling so could not go back. Again they contacted me in 2020 September so I decided and started my treatment. With Dr. Neha Singh I started my treatment and went so well, she was very kind, patience and friendly with me. She understood all my problems and gave treatment according that. Thank you Dr. Neha Singh for your treatment and advice.  I'm so happy I can smile without consciousness now. I'm really very thankful for you. ",

I had been consulting with many orthodontics for diastema problems and most of them were saying it cannot be fixed as age is 30+ and some said it would take  longer period etc..Finally I have found Dr Neha Singh at Beyond Smiles Indira Nagar and consulted with Dr Neha Singh. She have explained about my diastema and treatment options very clearly. I have started my treatment with metal braces and I started seeing the results gradually, within a year almost all gaps were closed.On every follow up visit, she would thoroughly check the issue and give feedback.She is very friendly and result oriented person. I would strongly recommend Dr Neha Singh and Beyond Smiles for diastema treatment.",

Finally when we met for the start of the treatment, it was a smooth ride. She was very gentle with my kid and her suggested braces helped straighten my kid's teeth to all our satisfaction. I am looking forward to the complete treatment plan as per the schedule discussed. She is truly helpful and easy going, I have found her available over chat/phone whenever I needed her. Highly recommend her for orthodontic treatments for kids. ",

As a non-dentist, I feel I understand quite a bit now. Through all the time I\u2019ve spent with these braces I\u2019m quite glad it happened with dr Neha and not any other orthodontist. I\u2019ve had bad experiences with dentists before and this was a world of difference. She gave me comfort and security to let her help my tooth journey. ",

I completed my entire procedure up until braces removal and retainer installation under her guidance. I am really satisfied with the result. She has been extremely friendly, very informative and committed throughout the entire procedure. It's because of Dr Neha I have been able to put up a good smile and be confident about my looks.

Then I had a detailed discussion about my case with Dr Neha and Dr Gurudev and I came to know that aesthetic dentistry is not the permanent solution for me. Finally, Dr Neha convinced me to go for orthodontics and wear braces for some time which I did. This treatment normally takes much time but in my case surprisingly my teeth alignment happened within 6 months. And now after getting the braces removed I have a much better smile and any aesthetic treatment is really not needed. ",
