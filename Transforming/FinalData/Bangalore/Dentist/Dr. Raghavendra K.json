Dr Raghu is a great communicator, has an excellent and calming bedside manner, and as a nervous patient he gave me a, pain-free experience! HIGHLY recommended. For people who like more details: I have had some bad/painful past experiences with dentists which has made me a very nervous patient when I need work done. Unfortunately, I also grind my teeth at night and when I chipped a tooth recently I waited almost  year to go to the dentist because I was afraid. A friend recommended Dr.Raghu so I decided to go in for a visit. The night before the appointment, I literally had nightmares about the dentist! When I came in to the clinic Dr.Raghu greeted me with a friendly smile and a warm handshake and I immediately felt more at ease. He took a look at my problem tooth as well as a check of all my other teeth and talked me through the procedure we needed to take on. My hands were immediately sweating and my heart was racing at the thought of the procedure that was about to happen. He gave me some options for anesthesia and I told him of some of my last experiences and my fear, so we made a choice for the best option for me. He put me at ease through the whole numbing process and I knew I was going to be fine. He kindly and patiently talked me through every step and within minutes of beginning the procedure I was completely relaxed WHICH WAS A MIRACLE! By the time we finished I wanted to give him a big hug and do cartwheels out of the office... but I knew that might be weird so I just thanked him profusely. That night when I lay in bed I had the biggest relief knowing I didn't have to dread making that appointment and was to thankful that it all went so unbelievably well. Thanks to Dr. Raghu, Dr Shweta and their team for such a great experience! ",

Dr Raghu is a great communicator, has an excellent and calming bedside manner, and as a nervous patient he gave me a, pain-free experience! HIGHLY recommended. For people who like more details: I have had some bad/painful past experiences with dentists which has made me a very nervous patient when I need work done. Unfortunately, I also grind my teeth at night and when I chipped a tooth recently I waited almost  year to go to the dentist because I was afraid. A friend recommended Dr.Raghu so I decided to go in for a visit. The night before the appointment, I literally had nightmares about the dentist! When I came in to the clinic Dr.Raghu greeted me with a friendly smile and a warm handshake and I immediately felt more at ease. He took a look at my problem tooth as well as a check of all my other teeth and talked me through the procedure we needed to take on. My hands were immediately sweating and my heart was racing at the thought of the procedure that was about to happen. He gave me some options for anesthesia and I told him of some of my last experiences and my fear, so we made a choice for the best option for me. He put me at ease through the whole numbing process and I knew I was going to be fine. He kindly and patiently talked me through every step and within minutes of beginning the procedure I was completely relaxed WHICH WAS A MIRACLE! By the time we finished I wanted to give him a big hug and do cartwheels out of the office... but I knew that might be weird so I just thanked him profusely. That night when I lay in bed I had the biggest relief knowing I didn't have to dread making that appointment and was to thankful that it all went so unbelievably well. Thanks to Dr. Raghu, Dr Shweta and their team for such a great experience! ",
