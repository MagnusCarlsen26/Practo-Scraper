,,0,0,YES," ****** ******* ** *** **** ******* * **** **** **** She is so friendly. Her smile is so contagious. Her way of explaining is very much impressive. I have experienced a root canal treatment with other dentist. It was so painful. She didn't even care about it. I have the pain on that tooth even today. 
But I have a totally different experience with Doctor Shaista. I didn't feel much pain and I could eat with the tooth the very day I had the treatment. It's really wonderful. Amazing experience. I would like to suggest everyone around to come and give a try. You will understand only if you experience. I highly recommend this loving passionate doctor. Thank you Doctor Shaista. God bless you üòá",2020-03-14 11:47:24,False,True,Salomi Raj,,,
