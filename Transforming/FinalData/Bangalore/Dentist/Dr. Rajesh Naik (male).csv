"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I cannot express enough how grateful my family and I are for the incredible care we received from Dr. Rajesh Naik. My mother was suffering from severe pain in her upper teeth and swelling, and our initial visit to another hospital left her in distress with the possibility of tooth extraction.

Thankfully, we decided to seek a second opinion from Dr. Rajesh Naik, and it was a game-changer. Dr. Naik quickly identified the root cause of my mother's dental problem, which stemmed from an injury that occurred nine years ago. This injury had led to the formation of an infection in her upper teeth.

Dr. Naik's diagnosis was clear: my mom needed surgery and a root canal. Understandably, my mother was apprehensive about the pain and the procedure itself. However, Dr. Naik's expertise and gentle approach put her at ease.

The surgery went smoother than we could have ever hoped for. Dr. Naik's skill and precision minimized any discomfort, and the pain was far less than expected.

Our experience with Dr. Rajesh Naik was nothing short of exceptional. His professionalism, compassion, and dedication to his patients are truly commendable. He not only saved my mother's teeth but also her peace of mind.
