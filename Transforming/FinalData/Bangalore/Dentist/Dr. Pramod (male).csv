Invisalign has worked well for me. It was a hassle-free treatment. The aligners were comfortable and removable when eating and cleaning. While I was wearing the braces, they were hardly noticeable and near to invisible. I saw visible results in the first two months itself and in 6 months my teeth were 90 percent straight. 

Dr Pramod and his team are very diligent, and they helped me ensure that I was wearing the aligners, following the guidelines, and keeping the appointments. Overall, I had a good experience throughout the treatment!

You came to us with a complaint of headache because of the upper right teeth during the pandemic. After x-ray and clinical examination, we spent nearly 2 hours diligently trying to counsel you, for not to go for extraction and take an
 opinion from a neurologist or a ENT for the headache and that nothing 
was wrong with your tooth. 

You kept insisting for extraction relating the headache to your teeth.
 For the three dental procedures done over a period of 14 appointments,
 every time we spent good 20 min to 30 min consulting and explaining pros and cons of the procedure,  gave enough time to think and only then proceeded in the  presence of your family member.
Every appointment we kept insisting about taking a second opinion from a neurologist / ENT.

Its been 3 months from your last visit to our clinic; I'm hoping at least now you visit a physician for your headache. Wish you a speedy recovery.
Kindly, be more responsible with your testimonials; as it does affect the doctors health, mind; and is demotivating.",2021-11-02T11:27:31+0000,Dr. Pramod
