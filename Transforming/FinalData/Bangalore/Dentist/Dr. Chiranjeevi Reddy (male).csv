"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Crowns,",0,0,YES,"Hello Everyone,
I met Dr Chiranjeevi Reddy in the year 2010 one of my visit to a Dental clinic in my neighborhood. Every time for my dental issues I used to visit him, on one of my follow up visits to him, I was told he had set up his own clinic. I did not get his contact details from the clinic nor could I find his contact details on the Internet. So, I started visiting other dentists for my dental issues, but could not find any Dentist who gave the treatment like Dr Chiranjeevi Reddy. So I decided to look for Dr Chiranjeevi Reddy again.
Thanks to Practo, I could get Dr Reddy's contact details in 2019. I was very happy to get his contact details and more happier when I visited him and got the treatment. Even after 9yrs he could recognize me.
About his new clinic,
1.	His staff is very courteous and as professional as Dr Reddy
2.	All your calls to the clinic are answered. Missed calls are promptly returned by the staff
3.	Appointments are honored. Also very minimal waiting time
4.	All doctors at the clinic are very helpful.
5.	You get advice according to your dental condition and not according to cost of the treatment
6.	Cost of treatment is reasonably priced.
7.	Clinic is very neatly and cleanly maintained

This clinic is ideal for anyone having Dental issues and I strongly recommend you consider this clinic for your dental treatment.
