He was very friendly and reassured me about the treatment.\nThe extraction was done smoothly. I didn't even have any swelling after extraction.  \nOnce the wisdom tooth is removed, the root canal procedure for the adjacent tooth is also performed. \n I would rate the whole experience as outstanding and would definitely recommend.",

The finishing of surgery is so good that in one month people could not able to guess that i went through such a big operation. There is a hair line scar of cut and no pain at all. Apart from professional attributes  I felt about Dr Sathish is, that he is a very humble as a person and will always reply to your messages and try to help you put as much as possible. I am still in touch with him for some of my dental issues. I will highly recommend Dr Sathish for any relevant requirements you have, the experience won't disappoint you for sure. ",

After delivery, the plastic surgeon of the hospital gave us hypothetical information about the complications of Cleft Palate which created great anxiety and fear about our baby's future. But when we met Dr. Sathish after 4 months of delivery at his clinic, he explained to us very well the whole idea about Cleft palate, symptoms, and its treatments. He explained to us the whole details of the surgery and post-surgery care. Dr. Sathish is a humble and well-experienced surgeon who is meticulous in his work and it shows. We felt peace in mind and hope regarding our baby's future after talking to Dr. Sathish. Our baby's surgery date was planned and accordingly, as per the schedule, the surgery was performed by Dr. Sathish and his team at Aster Hospital. We as a family are very happy with the results and our baby is doing well now. We would strongly recommend Dr. Sathish to all those parents like us who are having babies with Cleft Lips or Palate or planning to do Cleft Lips or palate surgery. Thank you so much Doctor Sathish and God bless you and your medical professional life.",

The finishing of surgery is so good that in one month people could not able to guess that i went through such a big operation. There is a hair line scar of cut and no pain at all. Apart from professional attributes  I felt about Dr Sathish is, that he is a very humble as a person and will always reply to your messages and try to help you put as much as possible. I am still in touch with him for some of my dental issues. I will highly recommend Dr Sathish for any relevant requirements you have, the experience won't disappoint you for sure. ",

After delivery, the plastic surgeon of the hospital gave us hypothetical information about the complications of Cleft Palate which created great anxiety and fear about our baby's future. But when we met Dr. Sathish after 4 months of delivery at his clinic, he explained to us very well the whole idea about Cleft palate, symptoms, and its treatments. He explained to us the whole details of the surgery and post-surgery care. Dr. Sathish is a humble and well-experienced surgeon who is meticulous in his work and it shows. We felt peace in mind and hope regarding our baby's future after talking to Dr. Sathish. Our baby's surgery date was planned and accordingly, as per the schedule, the surgery was performed by Dr. Sathish and his team at Aster Hospital. We as a family are very happy with the results and our baby is doing well now. We would strongly recommend Dr. Sathish to all those parents like us who are having babies with Cleft Lips or Palate or planning to do Cleft Lips or palate surgery. Thank you so much Doctor Sathish and God bless you and your medical professional life.",
