This doctor diagnosed TMD with Occlusal interference. He removed the interference by using his instrument and everything got ok after that. All the pain disappeared. \n\nNeither I had to put any braces for a year nor I had to pay such a huge amount for treatment. I won't recommend him.

In spite of the fact that I requested multiple appointments in response to my concerns, he enabled all appointments with patience and enabled treatment without a economic mindset. The alignment of my teeth has now been achieved through the assistance of Dr. Purjari.\n\n I recommend Dr Pujari for the following reasons;\n\nPatience: It is an essential quality for doctors to be patient while listening to their patients' concerns in order to understand and address them.\n\nThe doctor cannot always be economical : in the event that things do not go as planned, the doctor should be able to extend the treatment without putting the patient at an undue financial burden.\n\nTrust and assistance: It is the responsibility of doctors to establish trust and provide assistance to patients in times of difficulty\n\nHappy ending: The patient should leave with a smile at the end of the treatment. \n",

He detailed me about the procedure and strongly said no to extraction as my tooth could be saved. \n\nExcellent painless procedure : \nI went ahead with the treatment. The procedure was done in 2 sittings and now I am pain free. Even during the procedure, the doctor was constantly aware of my pain and made sure I was comfortable and painless. \n\nA doctor who values patients over money :\nFinally he suggested me a metal+porcelain cap rather than the full porcelain cap by looking at my tooth condition. I want to insist on this point because the full porcelain cap in way costlier and I was ready to pay. \nBut he closely examined my teeth condition and suggested I go for less expensive (metal + porcelain) cap, because that suits my teeth the best.  \n\nI am very impressed with Dr Pujari' s treatment and recommend anyone with dental problems visit Dr Pujari. \n",

This doctor diagnosed TMD with Occlusal interference. He removed the interference by using his instrument and everything got ok after that. All the pain disappeared. \n\nNeither I had to put any braces for a year nor I had to pay such a huge amount for treatment. I won't recommend him. And i am not sure how he has got so much recommendations. \n\nPS: I am reviewing this after 2 years now, just to make sure the problem did not reappear.",

In spite of the fact that I requested multiple appointments in response to my concerns, he enabled all appointments with patience and enabled treatment without a economic mindset. The alignment of my teeth has now been achieved through the assistance of Dr. Purjari.\n\n I recommend Dr Pujari for the following reasons;\n\nPatience: It is an essential quality for doctors to be patient while listening to their patients' concerns in order to understand and address them.\n\nThe doctor cannot always be economical : in the event that things do not go as planned, the doctor should be able to extend the treatment without putting the patient at an undue financial burden.\n\nTrust and assistance: It is the responsibility of doctors to establish trust and provide assistance to patients in times of difficulty\n\nHappy ending: The patient should leave with a smile at the end of the treatment. \n",

He detailed me about the procedure and strongly said no to extraction as my tooth could be saved. \n\nExcellent painless procedure : \nI went ahead with the treatment. The procedure was done in 2 sittings and now I am pain free. Even during the procedure, the doctor was constantly aware of my pain and made sure I was comfortable and painless. \n\nA doctor who values patients over money :\nFinally he suggested me a metal+porcelain cap rather than the full porcelain cap by looking at my tooth condition. I want to insist on this point because the full porcelain cap in way costlier and I was ready to pay. \nBut he closely examined my teeth condition and suggested I go for less expensive (metal + porcelain) cap, because that suits my teeth the best.  \n\nI am very impressed with Dr Pujari' s treatment and recommend anyone with dental problems visit Dr Pujari. \n",

The tooth was filled once 6 years back. \n\nTotal procedure took 4 visits (including fixing cap/crown). Dr. Srivatsa  said he goes slow to avoid any reinfection after RCT. \n\n-  First visit (approximately 15 mins, By Dr MR Pujari):  The tooth was \ndrilled little bit and cleaned. Did not have pain after first session.   \n-  Second visit (approx. 45 mins): Tooth preparation was done and cap measurement was taken by Dr Pujari. Half of the RCT was done by Dr. Srivatsa. Dr. Srivatsa was friendly and patient.  \n-  Third visit (20 mins, Dr Srivatsa) : RCT was completed. \n-  4th visit (15 mins) : Cap fixing was done by some Lady doctor. \n\nOverall experience : Very good and painless RCT experience. \n\nCons : Not as such. \n\nNote : Not sure if I can mention it here. Doctor could have advised not to take food till local anesthesia subsides. I bit my lips many times (As sensation was nill I did not realize I was biting myself :) ) as I started taking dinner just after 3rd visit. I realized it only after sometime. ",

But  doctor expalined everything  abt the procedure in details and claered all my doubt without getting annoyed by my questions. The extraction procedure toom only around 15 mins. It was not painful at all. I  definitely like to visit to the doctor again when required.\n",

When I visited another clinic, they told me that the earlier RCT was not done properly and some of the canals were not filled and hence become exposed now and pain. He even shared couple of x-rays which i sent to dr Pujari for confirmation. Dr. Pujari confessed that he had done a huge mistake and said that he forgot to fill some canals. Is this explanation acceptable? He offered to rectify the same now, which other doctors says cannot be done and hence the entire process of RCT to be done again. Now imagine how careless Dr Pujari is? He forgets something during treatment and takes it so casually and does not even check after completing the treatment. I recommend NOT to visit this doctor.",

Unbelievable, Dr. M.R.Pujari removed her wisdom teeth in just 5 to 10 seconds. He has not referred any x-ray. It shows the doctor's experience. Looks like he is not expensive doctor and also dedicated to the service. He waited for about 30 mins, as we reached lately due to traffic. Post treatment, she feels very comfortable and normal. No swelling and no pain. Unfortunately, there is no 10 start rating system.  Thanks to the doctor.",

For dental procedures, hygiene is of prime importance and that was completely missing in the 32 Smiles clinic at Kundalahalli Gate. The walk via rickety steps to the first floor was a bad experience. The clinic need to be sanitized and hygienic for patients to feel comfortable and visit or else the clientele will decrease.",

Dentures were made (looked like he was forced), they were ok and worked good for first week. After which the holding clips twisted, never happened in earlier denture. Gave them back to him for repair, the wire again lost its hold after a week. On complaining he cited of warning such issues before treatment. Such issues ?

It would be nice if pamphlet is given to patients for general oral hyegine esp. for patients who cannot access internet. Thanks.",

He suggested that I should get Root Canal Treatment done because there may be a cavity between wisdom teeth and the one next to it. Also he gave medication for temporary relief which worked efficiently. Next day, I went for RCT and he quickly took x-ray just to confirm and he found that my teeth are clean and there is no cavity, but he doubted that infection reached till the roots which is causing the pain. He suggested to continue the medicine that he has given for 5 days and said I don't have to visit him again if there is no pain.\n\nAfter 5 days, I don't have the pain. He is just amazing.

Underwent composite layering once but it lasted for a little time. I got to know about this clinic and Dr pujari, visited here and met with pujari sir. He checked my case thoroughly and advised me for ceramic caping. With very simple words and diagrams he made the whole procedure understandable for me. I find it effective also cost wise.

Very friendly and honest doctor. He listens to patient's words completely and then starts check up which I liked a lot. He gives us all options and tells treatment cost and procedure before starting. But huge rush of patients. We need to wait but results are EXCELLENT. ",

Doctor explained everything in Telugu as my mother can understand only Telugu. I was happy that doctor knows lot of regional languages along with other languages. This really helped me and my mother. His treatment started with removal of her teeth which turned to be painless and was comfortable to my mom. He initiated denture fabrication and now after 2 months my mom can have all kinds of food. For a son this is the  happiest movement.\nThanks a lot to Dr. Pujari ",

We agreed and treatment was done in 15 days as it was a full denture case. Tooth removals were done by Dr. Pujari and it was painless for mother who was very scared initially. He could speak a good Hindi as my mother can understand only Hindi. He was very gentle while handling the case. Though there was some discomfort while giving anesthesia but that is negligible. Later denture fabrication was done along with Denture specialist Dr. Javad who also handled it very smoothly. My mother is happy now with her new teeth.\n\nConclusion\n\n1. Doctors and team are well qualified and experienced.\n\n2. They know most of the languages of south and north so no problem with senior citizens\n\n3. Cost comparatively less \n\n4. Treatments are painless\n\n5. Explanation about treatment, procedure and cost is very clear\n\n6. Easily reachable for people of Marathalli and kundalahalli ( except one way)\n\n",

Since I might get late, I requested through message to your personnel number 40min prior to your appointment. We even rescheduled your appointment on practo.But, You didnt reply at all. So we assumed that you are more interested in just booking rather than visiting a good doctor for painless treatment which should be a primary concern not the place. I even visited clinic where you had booked on same day but little late. But you didnt come at all and no response.\n\nKINDLY DO NOT PUT FALSE ALLEGATION.

I did some online research and saw good reviews about Dr. Pujari and consulted him next day. \r\nHe took xray and said that my previous root canal was not done properly by my previous dentist. I was disappointed as I had huge trust on my old dentist which I expressed to Dr. Pujari.\r\nDr. Pujari is so kind that he told this needs a repeat root canal which you can get it from your previous dentist free of cost. This one point clearly stated me that this doctor is not greedy and is honest with his diagnosis.\r\nI spoke to my old dentist regarding this and mailed him xray also but he didnt respond at all. I continued to have pain and when it became unbearable, I went back to Dr. Pujari. He did the root canal without causing me pain and my pain went off in just 30min. He gave discount as well. \r\nHe is the first dentist I have seen in my life who wanted to save patients money. Unlike other dentists who not only do mistakes in treatment but charge huge. \r\nDr. Pujari is an example to all dentists...\r\n",

If root canal fails, it is due to chronic infection,means if patient comes to us with late infection stage ,root canal cannot be guaranteed. At our clinic we do 100-150 root canals monthly out of which 5-10 can fail because poor prognosis of tooth. And it is same in all clinics of the world.

First of all Dr Pujari mostly doesn\u2019t do RCT. There is always some junior doctors for that. That is the most surprising fact. Regarding RCT, mine was not done properly hence infection started after few months. They said it is human level error from their side. Cleanliness and hygiene condition is very poor. You have to remove shoes even when the support staff keep on roaming with dirty shoes. The passage or ladder to go up stairs is very dangerous. Not easy to climb for healthy or older people. I really suggest they close the Kundalahalli branch and open somewhere else with proper amenities and experienced doctors.",

This is because the crown was fixed by ***** ************* intern not by the doctor. In my case doctor only came to check what intern are saying correct or not.

After searching for a good dentist and on my friends recommendation, I visited doctor pujari . He explained everything very nicely in simple terms and told me to go for extraction as root canal was not possible. I gave my approval. He did it with all care. It was a painless extraction. \n\nWhat I found in my experience is that , he is well versed with his work. His treatment was quick. Within seconds my badly decayed tooth was extracted. He has ability to make any kind of tough case simple and thats what as a patient we need. ",

It's your job to get it corrected by putting crown for it. Sometimes if infection of the tooth is more then it takes more than three visits and sometimes if a tooth has internal fracture obviously it will break. So doctor cannot be held for poor prognosis of your tooth. Our clinic has always refunded money if treatment fails. But if it's patient mistake or if it is due to long standing infection of your tooth, then we can't help. ",

It was not in hurry at all because I gave a separate time and appointment for this. Though this treatment you opted was temporary it was expected to stay for few months. But, since your teeth were fluoride affected composite binding capacity will be weak as there is less enamel. Crowns was the only best option for this which we had told you earlier before starting it, we had even shown you some previously done cases photos. Since you opted temp. solution we did it. We would have tried with liquid composite but you asked refund and we did it completely without taking a penny. Anyways we look forward to see you again.",

It is not operation. Many people know that wisdom tooth dont come out like a normal tooth and their removal is not simple. Only 10-20% of the cases it is removed easily without stiches. But if your tooth is impacted ,you cant help. Same in case of your wife. Cleaning tooth or simply giving medication wont solve problem. We give medication only as initial prophylactic measure to reduce infection. But permanent solution is surgical removal of wisdom tooth.",

As my upper wisdom tooth was properly placed and lower one also is proper in alignment just it was cavitated. I immediately opted for the root canal, my treatment was started and it was completely painless. Within a weeks time my treatment is over and m relieved of pain . it was a awesome experience.

He had advised me to go for the tooth removal as it was very badly damaged and it cannot be saved. Then he told me about the tooth replacement options. He started with the tooth removal. After a week of healing I visited back again for the replacement procedure. The whole treatment finished about in just two weeks and it was completely painless. I got full relieve from pain and I start chewing from both the sides which I was avoiding from a long time. I feel happy because I can now eat everything. Treatment cost is also very reasonable.",

He told me that this problem is mainly due to the tartar deposits that were there in my tooth and gum joint. Advised to go for one round of  tooth scaling. After the treatment my gum bleeding came down remerkably within a week and now it has stopped completely. It was completely painless procedure and doctor is very good.

Once the patient is ok with all then only we give appointment. We had told you about cost initially itself. You agreed for the next day appointment and cost. Any emergency case we attend always on same day and immediately like tooth ache. Because, ours is a small but very busy clinic with patient coming from all areas so its tough to do on same day. I manged your kid so gently that she underwent fillings comfortably next day.\nNow, coming to cost, if you see other doctor fees consultation itself starts from 200-500 and registration extra. Whereas I even didnt take any consultation on first day. I checked and gave you appointment next day for filling. I did two tooth colored fillings for your kid costing 500 each which is very less compared to other clinics which usually charge 600-800 per tooth. \"AND ITS NOT MORE IN MARKET\".\nTwo hundred you asked discount that also I gave you.

I didn't get scared with sudden action of his or the instruments because he was explaining each step. I was just comfortably lying on the chair and getting it done painlessly almost like having a nice spa experience. Though clinic is small and roads are not good that side but after reaching and undergoing treatment you will not feel disappointed. Finally for all of us good treatments matter most.

I did some online research and my friends recommendation helped me in reaching out Dr. Pujari. On first visit itself he made me and my father so comfortable and kept all dental concepts so clear that we could easily understand. We started with treatment and now 2 weeks after treatment and multiple visits, doctor has not only given a brand new smile to my father but also importantly my father can chew food now. He can eat both veg and nonveg comfortably. I am happy that all the money that I have spent for this treatment is worth it. He is an extremely talented and skilled dentist.

But other dentists sitting in big hospitals know only how to make big money from patients. \r\nThis dentist is honest, never gives unnecessary treatment advice, rates are reasonable.

You primarily have big cavity in wisdom tooth which needs removal because of it's wrong position. \n\nClinic has two x ray machines and we take if and if only necessary.\n\n When case is clear you cannot take x ray unnecessarily as it is radiation which probably you are not aware. However x ray is taken prior to treatment or if doctor is in doubt. You also had a molar cavity for which you have undergone filling I guess from another doctor. Even we had also  suggested filling but after wisdom removal. You have undergone  only a partial treatment from somewhere else. You missed a painless treatment from a good doctor. You will soon regret it.\nClinic is small but clean as much as possible. Thanks for your baseless feedback.",

Cant we wait for some time to get good treatment from a reputed and good  dentist?.\nUsually on weekends there will be huge rush because everybody wants to get treated from Dr. Pujari only. Some times though there are appointments , some walk-in patients who have severe pain enter directly. As a human being and doctor, I have to attend them first. So sometimes regular appointments gets delayed by sometime. I am sorry for that . But I cant help. People travel from far distance to see me and get treated from me only in case of emergencies.These are those people who are not much educated like you and dont know anything about online booking. Its my duty attend such  patient first who have severe pain. I hope you understand.",

Being busy doesn't mean a doctor would do such mistake. We always tell procedure, cost and side of treatment and then only we do treatment that too when patient agrees. You might have visited some other clinic and had written here by mistake. A extraction is performed under local anesthesia and not general anesthesia. So, patient knows and can feel everything on the side being treated except pain. No one ties your hand and legs during treatment.Your view is something like \"I visited a heart specialist and he removed by wrong heart\".",

I cannot do everything because just like medical we have specialities, in dentistry also we have around nine specialities. If your case is very complicated then only I transfer case to my associate who is more experienced in complicated endodontics. I have all specialists in my clinic and they coordinate with me for complicated case solving. If you have pain after treatment means your failed rct done some where else done badly or severe infection case which needs some time to solve. Patent should have patience.\nFinally results is what matters and patient satisfaction. All treatments are done by me except few. Huge number of patients my friend, how a person can handle alone without help. ",
