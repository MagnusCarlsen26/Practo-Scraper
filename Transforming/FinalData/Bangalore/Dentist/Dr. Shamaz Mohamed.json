I approached many dentists in my country Saudi Arabia. But many of them gave different opinions regarding the treatment. Non of them satisfied my heart. Moreover, as everyone know that the treatment cost here in Saudi is very expensive. I could have spent and got treated here in Saudi itself, but was not satisfied with the treatment. So one of my friend here in Saudi Arabia recommended and told me the good open options and excellent treatment in India. So I started googling for it. I came to know about Eiliyah Dental care through it. I read many excellent reviews aswel. I called Dr Shamaz and told him regarding my problems. He was so obliged and prepared a tentative treatment chart. I came down to Bangalore one fine day. I went to the Clinic (Eiliyah Dental care). I was so much impressed about this clinical setup. He reviewed my mouth completely. He then prepared a final treatment chart which was very convincing to me. He started the treatment the very next day. First day he completed my Root Canal Treatment (RCT), later two days he did few gum treatment. And 4th day he started with denture work. With in 10 days he completely rehabilitated my mouth. This is all at an very affordable cost, the cost which is just 25% of the estimated cost in Saudi Arabia, using state of the art sufesticated instruments and equipment. Alhamdulill\u0101h now I am very much satisfied and appreciate the skills of the doctors in this dental clinic. Know it is almost more than a year, Alhamdulill\u0101h I am free of all ailments. \n\nI highly recommend this Eiliyah Dental care for all the people who need dental treatment at an affordable cost. May Allah bless the Eiliyah Dental care and the doctors in it.",

Soon as i went there i waited for like 2-3 minutes before getting sanitized to walk in and the doctor was soo friendly and checked everything and gave me advise and also helped me with payment plan as well as explained in detail about the issues going on with my teeth. I was humbled and knew I was at a place where I'm safe to go through the treatment and wallah the next day I got most of my work done and the doctor as well as the helper nurse were great at their work *** **** *** **** ********** A big thank you tooth saviours \ud83e\uddb7",

After reading a lot about Dr. Shamaz Mohamed and his treatment, I fixed an appointment for my dental check-up. The initial consultation made me comfortable and I decided to go ahead with the required treatment. I had to undergo multiple root canal procedures  & fillings. Everything about the treatment procedure & charges was explained before the procedure only.\n The treatment was painless, quick and efficient. After root canal treatment and crown procedure, my tooth looks so natural even I can't judge where the cap is placed. I am really satisfied with the look of my new caps. I recommend Dr. Shamaz Mohamed ** *** ** *** **** ******** ** ********* ********* * He has not only given my smile back but also my phobia for dental treatment is gone now.",

I have researched and studied carefully on the number of  dental care options available in and around Bangalore and finally landed up on Eiliyah. To be very frank I also landed up based on Google reviews :) \nDoctor Shamaz was very open about the real situation of my trauma. Initially I was scared to do root canal but I don't have any other options to restore my smile but the procedure was very straight forward and easy. Doctor is very cooperative and it took almost an hour and half to finish the Canal, it was really smooth.\nThey are very strict about the hygiene and quality of the products they use, full mark to them for their assistance.\nBecause of them now I can smile again.",

In 2 sections they got the root canal done through a specialist who came to their clinic and did the root canal and he did the wonderful job too. In two more sections they did the trimming of my teeth done and on one final section they put the fixed full mouth denture in 3 hours. Both Dr Shamaz and his wife Dr Haleema are very good and do exceptional job in addressing the needs of the patients. I am from US and lived in US for past 33 years and the doctors in US are the best but Dr Shamaz and Dr Haleema are no less than US doctors. I am very happy that I took the decision of getting my denture done under them and did the wonderful job. I thank them from bottom of my heart.

I approached many dentists in my country Saudi Arabia. But many of them gave different opinions regarding the treatment. Non of them satisfied my heart. Moreover, as everyone know that the treatment cost here in Saudi is very expensive. I could have spent and got treated here in Saudi itself, but was not satisfied with the treatment. So one of my friend here in Saudi Arabia recommended and told me the good open options and excellent treatment in India. So I started googling for it. I came to know about Eiliyah Dental care through it. I read many excellent reviews aswel. I called Dr Shamaz and told him regarding my problems. He was so obliged and prepared a tentative treatment chart. I came down to Bangalore one fine day. I went to the Clinic (Eiliyah Dental care). I was so much impressed about this clinical setup. He reviewed my mouth completely. He then prepared a final treatment chart which was very convincing to me. He started the treatment the very next day. First day he completed my Root Canal Treatment (RCT), later two days he did few gum treatment. And 4th day he started with denture work. With in 10 days he completely rehabilitated my mouth. This is all at an very affordable cost, the cost which is just 25% of the estimated cost in Saudi Arabia, using state of the art sufesticated instruments and equipment. Alhamdulill\u0101h now I am very much satisfied and appreciate the skills of the doctors in this dental clinic. Know it is almost more than a year, Alhamdulill\u0101h I am free of all ailments. \n\nI highly recommend this Eiliyah Dental care for all the people who need dental treatment at an affordable cost. May Allah bless the Eiliyah Dental care and the doctors in it.",

Soon as i went there i waited for like 2-3 minutes before getting sanitized to walk in and the doctor was soo friendly and checked everything and gave me advise and also helped me with payment plan as well as explained in detail about the issues going on with my teeth. I was humbled and knew I was at a place where I'm safe to go through the treatment and wallah the next day I got most of my work done and the doctor as well as the helper nurse were great at their work *** **** *** **** ********** A big thank you tooth saviours \ud83e\uddb7",

Everything about the treatment procedure & charges was explained before the procedure only.\n The treatment was painless, quick and efficient. After root canal treatment and crown procedure, my tooth looks so natural even I can't judge where the cap is placed. I am really satisfied with the look of my new caps.

I have researched and studied carefully on the number of  dental care options available in and around Bangalore and finally landed up on Eiliyah. To be very frank I also landed up based on Google reviews :) \nDoctor Shamaz was very open about the real situation of my trauma. Initially I was scared to do root canal but I don't have any other options to restore my smile but the procedure was very straight forward and easy. Doctor is very cooperative and it took almost an hour and half to finish the Canal, it was really smooth.\nThey are very strict about the hygiene and quality of the products they use, full mark to them for their assistance.\nBecause of them now I can smile again.",

Dr Shamaz and his wife Dr Haleema both practicing in their Eiliyah Dental Care in Wilson Garden, Bangalore. They both did the wonderful job in taking care of my Dental needs. In 2 sections they got the root canal done through a specialist who came to their clinic and did the root canal and he did the wonderful job too. In two more sections they did the trimming of my teeth done and on one final section they put the fixed full mouth denture in 3 hours. Both Dr Shamaz and his wife Dr Haleema are very good and do exceptional job in addressing the needs of the patients. I am from US and lived in US for past 33 years and the doctors in US are the best but Dr Shamaz and Dr Haleema are no less than US doctors. I am very happy that I took the decision of getting my denture done under them and did the wonderful job. I thank them from bottom of my heart. If any one has any dental needs to be addressed -  Eiliyah Dental Care in Wilson Garden, Bangalore is the place to go.",
