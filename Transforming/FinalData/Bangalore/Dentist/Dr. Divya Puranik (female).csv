"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Examinations,Dental Braces Fixing,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,Got to know about Puranik's dental care while I was searching for a female othtodontist to get the dental braces. was impressed with the reviews and ratings seen on Practo and Google and decided to have a visit. The best thing about Doctor Divya is she is very responsive and addresses to the case proactively over WhatsApp and calls . She follows up about the patient on regular basis which allow us to share in case of any issues without hesitation. We had to go for wisdom tooth extraction and she got an expertise surgeon and the extraction was done so friendly and smoothly. She listen to the patient's concerns and suggest the right and required treatment. One good thing abo Dr Divya is she has her own clinic and you can get the concerns addressed w r t dental braces in fastest way unlike other orthodontist who visits their partners clinic ok monthly basis. I will post another review after few months of treatment and results.

,,0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Puranik to get braces fitted for my daughter to set right her misaligned teeth.
Right from day 1, Dr. Puranik was very friendly and helpful. 
She explained the entire process in detail, made my daughter shed her inhibitions towards braces and offered us all the available options clearly.
She let us choose the option as per our budget and never pushed or influenced us to go for expensive ones.
Dr. Puranik is very knowledgeable, fully approachable and flexible in modifying appointment timings. We've never had to wait for our turn even a single time. She makes herself available exactly at the appointment time.
We are so far very happy with her and highly recommend her.
We have several more sittings to go before the final outcome, so I'll post another review at the end.",2023-10-14 11:52:21,False,True,VENKATESH RAMANATHAN,Thank you! ,2023-10-14T13:30:27+0000,Dr. Divya Puranik
