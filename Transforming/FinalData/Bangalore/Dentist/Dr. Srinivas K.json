Despite consulting nearly seven doctors, her condition did not improve.\nThankfully, we were referred to Dr. Srinivas a month ago. He listened to her symptoms attentively and suggested conducting a biopsy. Within three days, the results confirmed that she had Oral Lichen Planus. Dr. Srinivas prescribed a course of medication, and to our surprise, within just 25 days, her condition had reduced by 70%. Now, after consistent treatment, her condition has improved by 95%, and she can enjoy spicy food once again.\nWe are immensely grateful to Dr. Srinivas for his exceptional care and expertise. His treatment has significantly improved my wife's quality of life, and we highly recommend him to anyone facing similar issues.\n",

Within a month of treatment I was able to open my mouth wide and there was clear evident of progress. I'm still undergoing treatment however as per Doctor examination in follow up Visits my disk is almost in its normal position and I could feel my pain is reduced drastically and I'm able to move my jaw comfortably. I highly recommend Doctor Srinivas for treatment of TMJ related disorders.",

This is a very rare disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout the body. It affects the mouth, Dry eyes, Joint pain. Even having proper food became difficult. Recently the situation was bad and there was severe bleeding from gums and redness in the gum. We approached Dr. Srinivas. He did a detailed investigation of the patient, coordinated with other rheumatologists and started the treatment with proper information to all the family members. Within two days of staring the medication, my mother was able to have light and soft food and within 10 days she had normal food. Post investigation during the first visit itself, doctor gave a Confidence that he will be able to reduce the impact by 90% within one-month time. Currently after one month, the situation is that she is in very good condition, taking proper food as normal. The gum bleeding is completely stopped and gum redness is also gone. I have never seen my mother taking food without any pains / issues in the last 8 years. This doctor is very gifted and am really glad to have approached him for treatment. \nWith this experience, I highly recommend Dr. Srinivas for any dental related issues as he is highly capable.",

No one gave me a proper explanation as to what happening with me. I use to get painful blisters in my mouth and it was causing difficulty in eating. On my visit to a ENT specialist, who identified that I might be suffering from  Lichen Planus, she suggested me to visit this doctor as he was a specialist in it.\n\nDr Srinivas, on consultation, spoke to the point. He quickly diagnosed my case. He gave me a thorough review of the potential causes, treatments and prevention measures. He did an oral biopsy to verify the issue and it came out positive for Oral Lichen Planus.  He then suggested a medicine for it along  control measures and changes in dietary habits. Since then I have visible improvement with my case. I would definitely recommend it. Hoping to see more improvements with his help.",

He listened to her symptoms attentively and suggested conducting a biopsy. Within three days, the results confirmed that she had Oral Lichen Planus. Dr. Srinivas prescribed a course of medication, and to our surprise, within just 25 days, her condition had reduced by 70%. Now, after consistent treatment, her condition has improved by 95%, and she can enjoy spicy food once again.\nWe are immensely grateful to Dr. Srinivas for his exceptional care and expertise. His treatment has significantly improved my wife's quality of life, and we highly recommend him to anyone facing similar issues.\n",

I'm still undergoing treatment however as per Doctor examination in follow up Visits my disk is almost in its normal position and I could feel my pain is reduced drastically and I'm able to move my jaw comfortably.

This is a very rare disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout the body. It affects the mouth, Dry eyes, Joint pain. Even having proper food became difficult. Recently the situation was bad and there was severe bleeding from gums and redness in the gum. We approached Dr. Srinivas. He did a detailed investigation of the patient, coordinated with other rheumatologists and started the treatment with proper information to all the family members. Within two days of staring the medication, my mother was able to have light and soft food and within 10 days she had normal food. Post investigation during the first visit itself, doctor gave a Confidence that he will be able to reduce the impact by 90% within one-month time. Currently after one month, the situation is that she is in very good condition, taking proper food as normal. The gum bleeding is completely stopped and gum redness is also gone. I have never seen my mother taking food without any pains / issues in the last 8 years. This doctor is very gifted and am really glad to have approached him for treatment. \nWith this experience, I highly recommend Dr. Srinivas for any dental related issues as he is highly capable.",

On my visit to a ENT specialist, who identified that I might be suffering from  Lichen Planus, she suggested me to visit this doctor as he was a specialist in it.\n\nDr Srinivas, on consultation, spoke to the point. He quickly diagnosed my case. He gave me a thorough review of the potential causes, treatments and prevention measures. He did an oral biopsy to verify the issue and it came out positive for Oral Lichen Planus.  He then suggested a medicine for it along  control measures and changes in dietary habits. Since then I have visible improvement with my case. I would definitely recommend it. Hoping to see more improvements with his help.",

It might sound trivial but my father's food intake reduced significantly due to the ulcers to a point that he started losing weight. \n\nWe had met 7 other doctors earlier over 2-3 months and none were able to diagnose or treat the ulcers. Hat tip to Dr.Srinivas for his willingness to listen thoroughly to the patient and taking detailed notes before even diving into the issue. It took him literally 2 minutes to diagnose that it was a fungal infection and prescribed medicines. In 2 weeks course, the ulcers disappeared. \n\nThank you very much, doctor! You're a godsend. \n\nThe clinic is spic and span. They follow all Covid-related precautions. The overall experience is a 10 on 10. Maybe 12 on 10!:)\n\n\n\n",
