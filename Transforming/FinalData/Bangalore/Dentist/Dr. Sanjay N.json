It was three years ago when this started (as it was continuation of orthodontic treatment which had started at some other place). I had other dental concerns which had to be addressed during the course of the orthodontic treatment. Dr.Sanjay ensured those were addressed as well. He also made sure his staff followed up with me for appointments. I would highly recommend Dr.Sanjay to anyone. You just have to trust him with the treatment plan without missing any appointments,  rest he will get it through. ",

I was very satisfied with the overall experience and the way in which the entire process was handled by the doctor and the clinic. Firstly, the doctor gives a clear understanding of the problem and the suitable treatment. Once the treatment is finalized, you don't have to worry about it again, since the course of treatment is handled in a very organised manner. I promptly received calls for my monthly appointments, and even when I had any issue in between the appointments, it was addressed immediately. The doctor is very friendly and discusses the details of the treatment and the progress in every appointment. The cost is a little on the higher side, but the quality of treatment was very good. I had no problem from the start to end, and I would definitely recommend Dr. Sanjay to anyone wanting an orthodontic treatment.",

I went to him to get the braces applied and get my teeth in place and the kind of patience shown by the doctor during my treatment is commendable instead of removing my few teeth and getting over with the treatment early he waited for the teeth to come in place which took little longer and helped in getting my teeth in place without removing any of them. I would like to thank you Dr. Sanjay from my heart for the treatment. He is very friendly and explains the issue very well. I would recommend him to everyone. \n\nP.S.: Patient also has to patient to get best out of the doctor.",

I was immediately happy with how transparent they were and how easy they were to use and remove and I didn\u2019t have to keep visiting my dentist. They fitted my lifestyle.They're comfortable and don't get in the way of normal activities like eating and chewing. \n\nThanks to the Invisalign treatment and Dr Sanjay I now feel so much more confident.",

It was three years ago when this started (as it was continuation of orthodontic treatment which had started at some other place). I had other dental concerns which had to be addressed during the course of the orthodontic treatment. Dr.Sanjay ensured those were addressed as well. He also made sure his staff followed up with me for appointments. I would highly recommend Dr.Sanjay to anyone. You just have to trust him with the treatment plan without missing any appointments,  rest he will get it through. ",

I was very satisfied with the overall experience and the way in which the entire process was handled by the doctor and the clinic. Firstly, the doctor gives a clear understanding of the problem and the suitable treatment. Once the treatment is finalized, you don't have to worry about it again, since the course of treatment is handled in a very organised manner. I promptly received calls for my monthly appointments, and even when I had any issue in between the appointments, it was addressed immediately. The doctor is very friendly and discusses the details of the treatment and the progress in every appointment. The cost is a little on the higher side, but the quality of treatment was very good. I had no problem from the start to end, and I would definitely recommend Dr. Sanjay to anyone wanting an orthodontic treatment.",

Like everyone (probably) I have negative dentist memories so am undeniably nervous in going but this dentist was calming and good at his job - I've noticed such a difference with my teeth \n\nTop notch from beginning to end, the Doc is super nice, friendly, informative and took care of my teeth with great care \n\nSmile now :)\n",

Smoking also causes a lot of stains .\nSo it differs from patient to patient.\nLooks like you have developed chromogenic bacteria ( repeated stain forming bacteria) \nWe have a solution for this .\nPlease feel free to reach out to us , so we can find a process to work together for a solution of ur stains .",
