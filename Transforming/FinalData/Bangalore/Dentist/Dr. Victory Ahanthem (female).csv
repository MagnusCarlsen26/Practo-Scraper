By nature, she is extremely sweet, caring and friendly. Has in-depth knowledge of dental procedures and very generously understands and listens to the problems of her patients! 

Dr. Victory explains her course of treatment in great details and advises what is best for the future of your teeth. If a procedure isn't necessary, she'd let you know!

She is equipped with a New & sparking clean clinic, latest equipments & tools, modern X-ray scanning systems and best in class team of Doctors, dental surgeon, assistants and lab technicians. She is very humble, down to earth and highly responsible. What really stands out is the subtle handling of her dental procedures, which is almost painless! 

Doctor pays lots of attention to details and follows hygiene and sterilisation protocols (like keeping sterilised tools in UV chamber) to the highest standards! What I really appreciate the most about Dr. Victory is that she has had a solution to every problem of mine and has resolved all my dental issues to the best of my satisfaction! 

Lastly, I'd like to mention that above all, Dr. Victory is a very genuine, friendly, humble and jolly, gem of a person, who shall even go out of her way to help you, should you have any pending problems/discomforts!
