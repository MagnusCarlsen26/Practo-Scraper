,,0,0,YES,Dr Priya and Dr Subash were very friendly *** ********* ******** They listened patiently to all my queries and replied each one of them with explanations and consequences. I went there assuming I had lots of issues related to my gums and retainers but they assured me not to worry and I had no issues..so I only got scaling done as part of my regular routine  consultation. Thanks a lot for all your suggestions really appreciate it. ,2020-09-23 06:40:20,False,True,Narmadha,,,
