When I first met him years back he had advised me to go for a few implantation.  I  contacted a few to know about their experience  of implantation  done elsewhere  which was negative.  So I hesitated to undergo as I am aged. I only underwent rootcanal  for a few few years back which was done excellently  by Dr. Reddy.  Having  convinced  I\n gathered courage  and went to him  for implantation.  I never expected that it would be done  painlessly.   Now  I a man of 84 is back with sweet sixteen teeth. Thanks to Dr. Venkateswara Reddy. ",
