I had extensive bone damage because of which no doctor was ready to do an implant even with bone graft.  Everyone suggested bridge which means scrapping off the perfectly fine adjacent two teeth for support. I was devastated after every doctor visit and then luckily came by Dr. Vathsala. Dr. Vathsala saw my scans and she told me I should continue to seek more opinion while she herself gets opinion from others. She got back to me in a day as promised and told me what I needed to hear. An implant was possible with bone graft but that the procedure will be expensive, healing will take a lot of time, and there are no guarantees. That's all I needed to hear, that there was indeed a chance that this might succeed. One year and multiple procedures later, I have an implant. My adjacent two teeth have been spared. It's worth every penny.  Dr. Vathsala is very kind, always smiling, easy to talk to, and makes sure you get the best possible options for your condition. I'm glad to have met her. ",

Dr Vatsala was very prompt in diagnosis that multiple RCT and metal caps have increased occlusion causing trauma to the jaw muscles. Dr Vatsala was kind enough to share a temporary pain reliving fix and long term permanent solution for my Mother. Dr Vatsala's approach to provide relief to the patient is commendable and she ensures utmost care and attention to each and every experience of the patient.

On calling Dr. Vathsala on a weekend, she immediately picked my call and we had a telephonic consultation. Next day, with all due permissions from authorities, Dr. Vathsala opened the clinic only for us. On consultation, doctor explained us the issue and treatment in detail. We were suggested RCT and the cost too was reasonable considering Bangalore standards. RCT was completed in single sitting and without any pain. Antibiotics were prescribed for next 5 days. However immediately after the treatment, the pain disappeared and my wife's tooth is back to normal. Thank you doctor for going beyond your call of duty and helping us during such times.",

I had extensive bone damage because of which no doctor was ready to do an implant even with bone graft.  Everyone suggested bridge which means scrapping off the perfectly fine adjacent two teeth for support. I was devastated after every doctor visit and then luckily came by Dr. Vathsala. Dr. Vathsala saw my scans and she told me I should continue to seek more opinion while she herself gets opinion from others. She got back to me in a day as promised and told me what I needed to hear. An implant was possible with bone graft but that the procedure will be expensive, healing will take a lot of time, and there are no guarantees. That's all I needed to hear, that there was indeed a chance that this might succeed. One year and multiple procedures later, I have an implant. My adjacent two teeth have been spared. It's worth every penny.  Dr. Vathsala is very kind, always smiling, easy to talk to, and makes sure you get the best possible options for your condition. I'm glad to have met her. ",

Dr Vatsala was very prompt in diagnosis that multiple RCT and metal caps have increased occlusion causing trauma to the jaw muscles. Dr Vatsala was kind enough to share a temporary pain reliving fix and long term permanent solution for my Mother. Dr Vatsala's approach to provide relief to the patient is commendable and she ensures utmost care and attention to each and every experience of the patient. She knows her craft so well and still ensures verification at every step with patient. Thanks doctor for helping my mom ,get rid of the pain while she enjoys her new set of caps \ud83d\ude42.",

On calling Dr. Vathsala on a weekend, she immediately picked my call and we had a telephonic consultation. Next day, with all due permissions from authorities, Dr. Vathsala opened the clinic only for us. On consultation, doctor explained us the issue and treatment in detail. We were suggested RCT and the cost too was reasonable considering Bangalore standards. RCT was completed in single sitting and without any pain. Antibiotics were prescribed for next 5 days. However immediately after the treatment, the pain disappeared and my wife's tooth is back to normal. Thank you doctor for going beyond your call of duty and helping us during such times.",
