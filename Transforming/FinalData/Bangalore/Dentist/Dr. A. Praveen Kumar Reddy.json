The kind of patience he had to explain what kind of products he is using, why he is using these product only and he also informed the multile products which are in available and which once we should not use and all this was very convenient and he explained it pretty nicely.

Also I wish the doctor could have explained me liitle bit more how to maintain and how prevent by the way of brushing or any other ways so that it would prevent the pain and also I have to ask for invoice, as they are not sending immediately after the treatment. I have already recommended the doctor for my husband but he didn't get the discount what I got for the same treatment.",

The kind of patience he had to explain what kind of products he is using, why he is using these product only and he also informed the multile products which are in available and which once we should not use and all this was very convenient and he explained it pretty nicely. Overall it was a fantastic experience. As prior to this also I have done RCT for one of my tooth and it was very painfull procedure but here it was prety good and I would recommend the doctor",

Also I wish the doctor could have explained me liitle bit more how to maintain and how prevent by the way of brushing or any other ways so that it would prevent the pain and also I have to ask for invoice, as they are not sending immediately after the treatment. I have already recommended the doctor for my husband but he didn't get the discount what I got for the same treatment.",
