"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I was having extreme tooth ache due to infected wisdom tooth as well as adjacent molar. My usual dentist told me that a specialist is needed to extract the wisdom tooth because of complications.  That's when I decided to consult Dr. Satish.
Dr. Satish explained me the problems very clearly and gave a plan of treatment. He was very friendly and reassured me about the treatment.
The extraction was done smoothly. I didn't even have any swelling after extraction.  
Once the wisdom tooth is removed, the root canal procedure for the adjacent tooth is also performed. 
 I would rate the whole experience as outstanding and would definitely recommend.",2020-08-15 05:12:07,False,True,Arjun Sanal,,,

Our baby was born with a Cleft palate. After delivery, the plastic surgeon of the hospital gave us hypothetical information about the complications of Cleft Palate which created great anxiety and fear about our baby's future. But when we met Dr. Sathish after 4 months of delivery at his clinic, he explained to us very well the whole idea about Cleft palate, symptoms, and its treatments. He explained to us the whole details of the surgery and post-surgery care. Dr. Sathish is a humble and well-experienced surgeon who is meticulous in his work and it shows. We felt peace in mind and hope regarding our baby's future after talking to Dr. Sathish. Our baby's surgery date was planned and accordingly, as per the schedule, the surgery was performed by Dr. Sathish and his team at Aster Hospital. We as a family are very happy with the results and our baby is doing well now. We would strongly recommend Dr. Sathish to all those parents like us who are having babies with Cleft Lips or Palate or planning to do Cleft Lips or palate surgery.
