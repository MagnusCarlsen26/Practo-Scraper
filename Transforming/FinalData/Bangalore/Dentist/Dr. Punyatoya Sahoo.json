My toddler gave everyone a hard time but Dr Sahoo remained patient and professional thru out. She was able to smoothen out the jagged edge of my child's tooh and gave us sound advice on how to do home treatment to prevent further damage. Her Brookefileld clinic is very new, great set up, spacious and modern looking all through out. Would definitely recommend patients to her.",

Without biting hard it will not come out and while having rice,dal no material specially hard materials cant come out . Add one more things if its deep and material cant hold I always advice to go for cap if I will agree I didn't tell on first time which I never ever missed out. When I mentioned on 2nd time then why didn't you go for cap treatment.  \n\nBlaming a doctor so easy she didn't do prepare treatment after advice to go for treatment why didn't go for treatment. Rude to child is not going to work . You knows why they will not corporate to us. Anyway you never know you will not know because you didn't read or study about child psychology.  Hold a second psychology means also you will think about his mental health no I'm talking about they are ability.  Please study and get knowledge before blaming doctor about their skill. \n\nIf you knows about DENTAL problems and how to prevent then you never blame doctor and if technology is improving to aware of things and knowledge not misused it .\n\n",

When in Bangalore we  visited to get the fillings examined by a ******** doctor. There was some filling material left on the spot which she recommended to redo and we promptly agreed.\nHaving a dental history myself,I asked a few questions and I found the answers fairly superficial .I got the feeling I made a mistake of booking her since she showed as Practo prime and popped up first on the app screen but too late in the game .\nThere was a broad advise of the kid not biting anything 'hard ' like a pencil . Candies,pencil ( of course) and anything slightly hard things were off menu.\nWithin 2 weeks one of the fillings completely fell off and we could not contact the doctor for about 10 days due to some issues . The kid was on a regular vegan diet of  mostly rice,daal all these days .\nWhen we visited  again ,she blamed the kid for doing things wrong like biting something hard. The doctor said,she had advised placing a cap on that area when she clearly said on the previous visit, a cap was not needed at that time !! She said I tell this to all -which means of course I needed better comprehension skills. She did the filling again -pretty rude and harsh with the kid and finished the procedure in a hurry.***** *** **** rudeness -too much to handle.She of-course promptly asked for her fees- pretty high - after that.Paid the fees and left with a deep feeling of regret at my choice of coming here .I am of-course going to consult another doctor to look at the kids teeth ** ***** ****** ********** *** **** ** ******* ***************** * ** **** *** *** **** * **** ************* ** ****** * ********** ****** *** ***** **** ******* ****** ** *** * *****  *** ** *** ******  *",

The crowns that were fixed on that didn't last for more than 3-4 days. We again went there and fixed it twice or thrice. She only blamed the kid saying that she is always trying pull it out thats why it is coming out. As the crowns were coming out several times *** **** ****** ** *** **** ** ******* *** ***** ************ i also  contacted different dentists to check the issue and understood that the issue is, the crown doesn't have a proper base to stick to the tooth as she made it very small. This was the scariest thing as the crown was coming out when the kid was having food. No medical emergency happened as my daughter was very careful while eating. Later i checked with other dentists and decided that i will not fix those crowns and made sure that the filling is proper. It was just that i lost 10000 rs only for crowns. After 2 months, my daughter started to get swelling on one of the tooth which had undergone half root canal treatment. As i have moved abroad, i showed it to one of the dentist here and they have referred me to a dental surgeon as it looks like there is some damage in the underlying nerves due to the earlier treatment and it is creating issues. After spending 25000-30000 rs on my daughter's teeth already in Bangalore, my kid have to again undergo so many more treatments and pains again. This is something that is not acceptable at all. I would recommend not to go in this doctor. I am sorry!! I didn't want to give any negative feedback, but i didn't see any other option after seeing the after effects of the treatment.",

Also, she very well explained about the treatment plan, duration, visit, cost. She is very professional, honest, straight forward. During and after the procedure I didn't get any pain. I came to her for gum problem, but she explained other dental problem as well.The best part is she allowed me to think. She didn't rush to the procedure. \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Punya to my friends and my family.",

Without biting hard it will not come out and while having rice,dal no material specially hard materials cant come out . Add one more things if its deep and material cant hold I always advice to go for cap if I will agree I didn't tell on first time which I never ever missed out. When I mentioned on 2nd time then why didn't you go for cap treatment.  \n\nBlaming a doctor so easy she didn't do prepare treatment after advice to go for treatment why didn't go for treatment. Rude to child is not going to work . You knows why they will not corporate to us. Anyway you never know you will not know because you didn't read or study about child psychology.  Hold a second psychology means also you will think about his mental health no I'm talking about they are ability.  Please study and get knowledge before blaming doctor about their skill. \n\nIf you knows about DENTAL problems and how to prevent then you never blame doctor and if technology is improving to aware of things and knowledge not misused it .\n\n",

When in Bangalore we  visited to get the fillings examined by a ******** doctor. There was some filling material left on the spot which she recommended to redo and we promptly agreed.\nHaving a dental history myself,I asked a few questions and I found the answers fairly superficial .I got the feeling I made a mistake of booking her since she showed as Practo prime and popped up first on the app screen but too late in the game .\nThere was a broad advise of the kid not biting anything 'hard ' like a pencil . Candies,pencil ( of course) and anything slightly hard things were off menu.\nWithin 2 weeks one of the fillings completely fell off and we could not contact the doctor for about 10 days due to some issues . The kid was on a regular vegan diet of  mostly rice,daal all these days .\nWhen we visited  again ,she blamed the kid for doing things wrong like biting something hard. The doctor said,she had advised placing a cap on that area when she clearly said on the previous visit, a cap was not needed at that time !! She said I tell this to all -which means of course I needed better comprehension skills. She did the filling again -pretty rude and harsh with the kid and finished the procedure in a hurry.***** *** **** rudeness -too much to handle.She of-course promptly asked for her fees- pretty high - after that.Paid the fees and left with a deep feeling of regret at my choice of coming here .I am of-course going to consult another doctor to look at the kids teeth ** ***** ****** ********** *** **** ** ******* ***************** * ** **** *** *** **** * **** ************* ** ****** * ********** ****** *** ***** **** ******* ****** ** *** * *****  *** ** *** ******  *",

The crowns that were fixed on that didn't last for more than 3-4 days. We again went there and fixed it twice or thrice. She only blamed the kid saying that she is always trying pull it out thats why it is coming out. As the crowns were coming out several times *** **** ****** ** *** **** ** ******* *** ***** ************ i also  contacted different dentists to check the issue and understood that the issue is, the crown doesn't have a proper base to stick to the tooth as she made it very small. This was the scariest thing as the crown was coming out when the kid was having food. No medical emergency happened as my daughter was very careful while eating. Later i checked with other dentists and decided that i will not fix those crowns and made sure that the filling is proper. It was just that i lost 10000 rs only for crowns. After 2 months, my daughter started to get swelling on one of the tooth which had undergone half root canal treatment. As i have moved abroad, i showed it to one of the dentist here and they have referred me to a dental surgeon as it looks like there is some damage in the underlying nerves due to the earlier treatment and it is creating issues. After spending 25000-30000 rs on my daughter's teeth already in Bangalore, my kid have to again undergo so many more treatments and pains again. This is something that is not acceptable at all. I would recommend not to go in this doctor. I am sorry!! I didn't want to give any negative feedback, but i didn't see any other option after seeing the after effects of the treatment.",
