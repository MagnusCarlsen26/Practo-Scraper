When I visited for the first time, I was a bit confused and not sure whether braces is the right choice for me and if yes, which ones shall I choose. Dr. Mahantesh explained me the use cases and helped me choosing the best one for me. After his suggestion I chose Damon Clear braces. It was good for me because of very low visibility when smiling, so I do not feel awkward at times in office or among friends. The process was supposed to last around a year. I got my tooth extractions as well (4 teeth, 2 from both sides) for getting the alignment better. For around 8-9 months, I used to have monthly visits for the tightening of the braces and getting it examined. Dr Mahantesh did the treatment very carefully, making sure that the progress is going towards the right direction. From the last 3-4 months, I am having a visit once in 3 weeks for the tightening of braces and changing of the wire.
