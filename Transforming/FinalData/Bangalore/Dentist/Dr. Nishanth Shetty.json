The clinic itself was clean, modern, and had a calming atmosphere, which really helped reduce any anxiety I had about the procedure.\nDuring the initial consultation, surgeon took the time to explain the extraction process in detail, addressing all of my concerns and questions. Their expertise and clear communication gave me confidence that I was in good hands.\nThe extraction itself was smooth and efficient. The surgeon and the dental assistants ensured I was comfortable throughout, frequently checking in on me and explaining each step as they proceeded. The procedure was much quicker and less painful than I had anticipated, thanks to their skillful approach.\nPost-extraction care was thoroughly explained, and I was given clear written instructions along with a prescription for pain management.\nI am extremely satisfied with my experience at Imex Care Clinic. The combination of a friendly staff, a knowledgeable and compassionate dentist, and a seamless procedure made what could have been a daunting experience remarkably easy. I highly recommend Imex Care Clinic to anyone in need of dental care, especially for those nervous about dental procedures. \n\nThank you, Imex Care Clinic for taking such great care of me!\n",

Their expertise and clear communication gave me confidence that I was in good hands.\nThe extraction itself was smooth and efficient. The surgeon and the dental assistants ensured I was comfortable throughout, frequently checking in on me and explaining each step as they proceeded. The procedure was much quicker and less painful than I had anticipated, thanks to their skillful approach.\nPost-extraction care was thoroughly explained, and I was given clear written instructions along with a prescription for pain management.\nI am extremely satisfied with my experience at Imex Care Clinic. The combination of a friendly staff, a knowledgeable and compassionate dentist, and a seamless procedure made what could have been a daunting experience remarkably easy. I highly recommend Imex Care Clinic to anyone in need of dental care, especially for those nervous about dental procedures. \n\nThank you, Imex Care Clinic for taking such great care of me!\n",

Nishanth, dr. Pooja and dr. Pratyushna(I guess name is correct) for explanation and treatment.\n\nAt other dental clinic near my house, dr told three cavity filling is needed and it would 2-3K per teeth filling. I was not convinced.\nYou can see two opp. advise from two different doctors.\nIt is very imp to have trusted doctor who really gives right feedback and not spoil your teeth with unnecessary treatment.",

He then explains it to you clearly what is the issue and what are the procedures available to go forward with. There will be more than one methods obviously which would depend on the pricing as well.2. Dr. Nishanth suggests best treatment with which we can go forward according to our problem.3. Dr. Nishanth is very genuine and transparent regarding the price point of view as well. And what i observed was he keeps the right pricing for the treatment procedures when compared to other dental clinics.I personally got my Teeth alignment done from here by opting for metal braces and i would say it's worth it. Even my friends are consulting him for all their tooth related problems. Just give it a shot and i bet Imprssns N Exprssns Clinic (Imex care) will be your one stop solution for all your teeth related problems. ",

Dr. Pooja , explained me the issue , after examining the x-ray (that took place in the clinic itself), and suggested for an extraction, giving a detailed insight on why that is the best possible remedy with the present situation. Dr. Nishanth , is very humble and cooperative and most of all, ensures that as a patient, you know every detail about your issue, the detailed resolution/procedure, why that procedure is needed, etc. etc. This helps to build the bond of trust with the doctors and today I underwent the extraction procedure and it went so smooth.  Not only he is highly skilled, he makes sure that you are comfortable throughout the procedure and extremely grounded.\n\nI would highly highly recommend \"Imprssns n Exprssns\"! And, would visit every time me or my family have any dental issue.\nThank you so much for spreading the good work..",

In actual, a dentist's job is to relieve ua from pain by providing us the best possible treatment. Dr.Nishanth Sir does exactly that for his patients. One doesn't feel the pain while undergoing a procedure as Dr.Nishanth has Magical Hands.\nBefore starting any treatment he takes us through our current medical condition and then suggests the treatment option and only post proper explaination proceeds with the treatment.\nAfter the treatment is done, he explains the patients in detail once again about the same and also on the way forward.\nOne of the best things about Dr.Nishanth Sir is that he is not driven my money and his motive is  to see his patients getting relieved from pain and smile before leaving his clinic.\n\nThank You God for Dr.Nishanth Shetty.\ud83d\ude0a\n",

He talked about the options, the number of visits and the cost involved. It went exactly the way he explained. \n\nAll my appointments were nicely scheduled with due reminders coming in from time to time and I was promptly attended to when I reached the clinic. In addition to being professional and masters at their work, the doctors attending to me were also very courteous, attentive and observant. This has made it so easy to connect with them and increased my comfort levels.\n\nThe clinic was very neatly maintained and were following all the covid precautions. This has made it more reassuring. \n\nThe whole treatment has happened the way he has explained and at each stage, they were telling me the next steps, which helped me with the clarity.\n\nI want to thank Dr Nishant for all his time and care.\n\nTill now, I was referring Dr Nishant based on what I have heard, but now I will refer him with a first hand experience. \n\nBest wishes to you Doc...Keep soaring high!",

My condition requires me to remove one tooth and get braces, and I know this is true since many other dentists have opined the same. The good thing about this visit was that he told me 'that' same way and also suggested other methods that which can be used to treat the same. Explained each process and why he believes one to be better than the other in my case. I live in Whitefield and I am happy to have found his clinic. In due course, over the next few months, I will definitely get my procedure done by him.\nComing to the money part, no where did I ever feel that I was being treated as a cash machine and that the treatments being suggested are witb due diligence to treat my actual problem. In my case, the gaps need to be filled and the only method is to get a pair of braces. He suggested that though this is NOT super important, but it is a permanent solution. The other solution would be to get a cleanup every 5-6 months (which anyway of all us should get done). ",

On the very first appointment itself I got my braces done at his clinic. \nHe is extremely professional, very patient and detail oriented Doctor. \nAccording to me, my dental alignment issue is bit complicated because I have consulted at least 5 doctors till date and my issue was never sorted ever since my teens. I had finally given up. But now after almost 15 years during this COVID season, I thought to give it one final try.  \nMy treatment started in Oct 2020 and to be very honest, I can see visible changes. Best thing is - as a patient now I trust the process and I feel confident with the treatment. \nI truly appreciate his patience level in providing solutions and altering the treatment accordingly. Many thanks Doc.\nI really look forward to completing my treatment and can\u2019t wait \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude42 \n\nTruly recommend Dr. Nishanth! Thank you! ",

She did an excellent job there without causing any inconvenience. \n\nWell, yesterday was the most surprising part. I met both Dr. Nishanth and Dr.Pooja. They did a fantastic job rectifying my tooth issues and cleaned up my teeth. They also explained the future treatment options. They approach every patient with a smile, which is a very valuable trait for a doctor - it would ease the patients\u2019 worries and give them confidence in the treatments. \n\nGo for them guys! You are in safe hands! \n\nFrom an extremely satisfied and happy patient. :) \n\nThank you, Dr. Nishanth and Dr. Pooja. Also thanks to Dr. Payal who kept on smiling the whole time. :)",

Doctors are very service minded and ethical. It's astounding to see such dentists at Bangalore where most are running businesses. It is one rare place with  ethics intact. They don't even charge for consultation and xray. I was told that I needed a root canal procedure done by a different dentist and was charged \u20b91200/- for consultation and xray but here Dr nishanth shetty completed cavity filling and scaling for \u20b91500/- . Save your health, time and money by visiting this place (impressns n expressns).",

Dr. Nishant in particular is very patient with patients\n (my kids and parents) and explains the problem, what needs to be done and provides proper advise. I have been to many dentists in Bangalore, but he is the best I have been to. Even my Kids are very comfortable getting treated by him. And its amazing that he charges only a fraction of what other dental clinics charge in the vicinity (less than 50%), and he does not charge for consultations either.  I would strongly recommend Imex Care, and I am sure you will not be disappointed !!!",

She had no pain after. 2) For my root canal and my case is a bit complex as there is a lot of infection but the team is taking bit slow and easy to ensure that infection is completely gone prior to further course of action . Overall very happy with the services ",

I did my homework online before visiting him. \nThe online reviews about microdermabrasion were unrealistic and when I visited him, he explained the entire concept to me in detail before going ahead with the treatment. He also set expectations right in the beginning and kept me posted with every instrument that touched my face. \nI highly recommend Dr. Shetty for any skin and dental needs :) \nThank you for the wonderful experience !

Have been visiting this Whitefield clinic since a few years now and would say it's very efficient and very well priced too. Dr. Nishanth is clear about treatment and options, and takes the time to patiently explain things as well. My last visit here was for a filling for part of my front tooth. He not only replaced it perfectly, on both aesthetic and function counts, but also removed a stain from another filling alongside. I'm always impressed at how he goes beyond the mere necessary to make sure he does a great job, and cares to make for attention to detail too. ",

My case included a minor surgery to get rid of my wisdom tooth, along with a RCT procedure for another tooth, and all these were done with a very minimal cost. \nThe best part was, all these procedures were done on me without letting me feel any pain! Even after the procedure, trust me I never felt any pain and swelling, probably because of the highest level of professionalism they maintained during my case. I would any day recommend anyone with their dental ailments, in and around Bangalore, to visit Dr.Nishanth's ImEx clinic to experience the best treatment in the city.\n\n- Libin",

I was one relieved patient post my consultation with him. Thank\nYou once again Doctor! ",

Entire Doctor Staff is very friendly,  humble and attentive. \nCost: I have been visiting few dental clinic arround AECS, Marathahalli area since 1 year for myself and my daughter (8 year old). Compare to any dental clinic this one is 3 times lower in terms of fee and charges for any check-up or treatment you take. Indeed, I would say they charge what is the actual cost of treatment and product they fit-in. \nAll doctors are well-versed with dental treatments knowledge.\n\nEntire process went smooth and got the tooth crown fitted, teeth cleaning and feeling.\nBest clinic near in Whitfield. \n\nThanks to entire staff\n",

Since I wasn\u2019t convinced with that, I decided to take second opinion in Imex clinic. One of my relatives suggested this clinic to me. I am glad I came here, they accurately diagnosed that it\u2019s nothing but the gum infection due to exposed gum and suggested a home care.\nThis is my second visit after an year for a regular yearly check up and am more than happy about their commitment towards treating patients right. \nHighly recommend this clinic ",

I pretty much always got an reply from him with in the day and an unscheduled appointment within a couple of days of asking.

He identified the issue  and mentioned that sorting the root cause could resolve many of the effects on its own. He also educated us on what treatments are time sensitive and what aren\u2019t keeping in mind the child\u2019s age.\n\nThe treatment was a simple and inexpensive one. My son just completed the 6 month treatment and the primary issue has been fully resolved. Many of the secondary issues too have improved substantially with no immediate need for braces. \n\nThe doctor has been a delight to deal with- being available when needed. Right diagnosis, prompt treatment, Providing the right information, recommending only necessary treatments. He was able to relate very well with my tween which made things much  easier. We simply can\u2019t recommend him enough. \n\nThe other staff and doctors in the clinic were also very friendly and helpful.",

His team Dr. Hema and others all are also very professional.\nI went there for wisdom tooth pain they have examined it and in most cases it would be tooth extraction but doctor suggested for small space creation activity with gum cutting which might fix the problem and there won't be any tooth extraction which is very painful procedure. And his small experimentation worked and I don't have to go through tooth extraction procedure. He is really good in his work, really appreciate it. \nThanks for all the help. ",

I feel even more apologetic that we were not able to address this issue before. \nI just wanted to explain to you that yours is an impacted third molar, which makes it a comparatively difficult case. If it were simple, we wouldn't have had to call a specialist. It was the surgeon's skill which made it look easy and you may have felt it is a simple case.\nOur charges are much lesser than any other clinic in the vicinity. That's a GUARANTEE. Still if there is something we can do to compensate, let me know.\nDr. Nishanth",
