When I was a child, one of my front teeth broke during playing. My front tooth was replaced by the dental bridge. That bridge was not good in look, moreover, fitting was so bad that I lived my life in a delusion that my mouth structure is such that my lips are not closing properly. After 11 years, I decided to do something about this bridge. I visited Dr. Mridula in May 2017. She checked my dental bridge and recommended for a change of dental bridge with zirconia premium. I went ahead with this procedure and replaced my old bridge with zirconia bridge. The outcome is very good. Now it looks natural and perfectly fitted. I am very happy with the look and fitting and it is one of my best investments. The doctor is meticulous in her approach because of this, I got the perfectly fitted dental bridge. A patient does not have to worry about anything, she will call up for follow-up if required. Patient is treated very well as Doctor and supporting staffs are humble. I highly recommend this clinic. Thank you, Doctor!\n",

Opened up of the tooth for pulp removal.\nDay 2- Root Canal procedure was done.\nDay 3- Filling of the teeth. Mould was taken for the dental cap.\nDay 4- Zirconium+ceramic cap was fitted.\n\nThere is a team of 4-5 doctors and assistants who work as a team on each patient.\nMajor procedures are done by Dr.Mridula herself and other procedures by remaining doctors. They discuss among themselves at each step to avoid any wrong judgements.\n\nThey are all well trained in the profession and the entire treatment went quite painless and troubleless for me.\nWell behaved, well explaining and well-coordinated team.\n\nThe expenses too seemed quite reasonable.\n\nI waited a month after my treatment to write this review to make sure there are no post-treatment issues.\n\nI will definitely recommend them to anyone in HSR and nearby areas.\n",

They said nothing much can be done and the procedure was correct. That time I really could not understand what the actual problem was. I was having major issues with eating and had consistent pain. I lived with the pain for months thinking that nothing could be done. \nFinally after reading up Dr Mridula's reviews I went to her. She understood the problem well and explained what could be done. She performed the procedure quite well and also calmed me down as I was bit hesitant based on my earlier experiences.

I made my booking at 4:00 AM on Sunday (the pain was so bad by then), and took an appointment for 9:00 AM with Dr. Mridula.\r\n\r\nThe doctor hadn't noticed her message until 8:30 AM I guess, but she promptly called me and requested if 10:00 AM is ok with me. I was ok.\r\n\r\nWhen I went in, the doctor was already in. She has a pleasing personality and quickly took my case history and went about her job in a very calm and soothing manner, explaining each step in detail (sometimes a tad too much detail for a non-BDS person I suppose, but she was nice enough to explain what I didn't understand in one go).\r\n\r\nI've faced multiple dentists in my life, for such is my history when it comes to dental care. Dr. Mridula is most definitely one of the best I have come across and her facility is also well equipped. She went about the tooth extraction (after showing me X-ray and explaining the situation) very well and it was painless and quick.\r\n\r\nShe also gave me recommendations of couple of other procedures I must be going for, though wasn't pushy about it. Over all, a very good experience at a time of real pain and emergency for me (on a Saturday late night / Sunday).\r\n\r\nThank you Doc!   ",

When I was a child, one of my front teeth broke during playing. My front tooth was replaced by the dental bridge. That bridge was not good in look, moreover, fitting was so bad that I lived my life in a delusion that my mouth structure is such that my lips are not closing properly. After 11 years, I decided to do something about this bridge. I visited Dr. Mridula in May 2017. She checked my dental bridge and recommended for a change of dental bridge with zirconia premium. I went ahead with this procedure and replaced my old bridge with zirconia bridge. The outcome is very good. Now it looks natural and perfectly fitted. I am very happy with the look and fitting and it is one of my best investments. The doctor is meticulous in her approach because of this, I got the perfectly fitted dental bridge. A patient does not have to worry about anything, she will call up for follow-up if required. Patient is treated very well as Doctor and supporting staffs are humble. I highly recommend this clinic. Thank you, Doctor!\n",

Opened up of the tooth for pulp removal.\nDay 2- Root Canal procedure was done.\nDay 3- Filling of the teeth. Mould was taken for the dental cap.\nDay 4- Zirconium+ceramic cap was fitted.\n\nThere is a team of 4-5 doctors and assistants who work as a team on each patient.\nMajor procedures are done by Dr.Mridula herself and other procedures by remaining doctors. They discuss among themselves at each step to avoid any wrong judgements.\n\nThey are all well trained in the profession and the entire treatment went quite painless and troubleless for me.\nWell behaved, well explaining and well-coordinated team.\n\nThe expenses too seemed quite reasonable.\n\nI waited a month after my treatment to write this review to make sure there are no post-treatment issues.\n\nI will definitely recommend them to anyone in HSR and nearby areas.\n",

They said nothing much can be done and the procedure was correct. That time I really could not understand what the actual problem was. I was having major issues with eating and had consistent pain. I lived with the pain for months thinking that nothing could be done. \nFinally after reading up Dr Mridula's reviews I went to her. She understood the problem well and explained what could be done. She performed the procedure quite well and also calmed me down as I was bit hesitant based on my earlier experiences.

I made my booking at 4:00 AM on Sunday (the pain was so bad by then), and took an appointment for 9:00 AM with Dr. Mridula.\r\n\r\nThe doctor hadn't noticed her message until 8:30 AM I guess, but she promptly called me and requested if 10:00 AM is ok with me. I was ok.\r\n\r\nWhen I went in, the doctor was already in. She has a pleasing personality and quickly took my case history and went about her job in a very calm and soothing manner, explaining each step in detail (sometimes a tad too much detail for a non-BDS person I suppose, but she was nice enough to explain what I didn't understand in one go).\r\n\r\nI've faced multiple dentists in my life, for such is my history when it comes to dental care. Dr. Mridula is most definitely one of the best I have come across and her facility is also well equipped. She went about the tooth extraction (after showing me X-ray and explaining the situation) very well and it was painless and quick.\r\n\r\nShe also gave me recommendations of couple of other procedures I must be going for, though wasn't pushy about it. Over all, a very good experience at a time of real pain and emergency for me (on a Saturday late night / Sunday).\r\n\r\nThank you Doc!   ",

I learned that when she treated me as I do consider myself a horrible patient in terms of being cooperative with the doctor. \n\nWill I recommend her as a good dentist to my friends? \nYes I will.

And in the same week we went for root canal. She is very supportive, kept me busy with her talks as I asked so that I dont feel much pain and mind gets diverted. staff members are also helpful. Her long experience can be seen in her work too.  She is kind and is not money oriented so wont advice you for big surgeries or root canal at first. **** **** **** ******** ******** ***** *** **** ******* **** *** *** *****",

I asked you to go get treatment with some other doctor. But you apologise and request me to do the treatment.\nYou came nearly 5 visit after that  and in the last visit you came with your family and got the check up done for your  son. if you were having so many issues why you brought your family. Also you asked for discount. I gave you discount also. \nAfter that you first gave negative recommendation with some random name \"Ruby Gupta\". We were not having any such name in our database. We followed through Practo and found that it was you. That was so surprising and shocking. I put lots of effort for your treatment and gave discount. Still you have grudge inside not sure for what. Even we called and asked why you have done that, again you misbehaved. \nWe, as doctor, serving patients with whole heart, but you don't have any rights to come and misbehave with us.\n\nRegarding Hygiene , we are using all disposable things like glass, gloves, suction tip, xray sleeves. Also sterilised instruments we are keeping in UV light chambers. After every patients my assistant cleans the chair with sterlizer cotton. We are using filtered/RO treated drinking water in dental chair.\nGod Bless You. best wishes",

The key points I like in her approach are:\n- She is very confident about her abilities as a dental specialist.\n- She explains the ailment and treatment procedure in great detail.\n- She is very considerate about pain and ensures that any procedure is done with least amount of discomfort to patient.\n- She always strives for high quality work and never does anything in haste.",

She explained the complete process, time taken for the procedure as well as the pricing for the same. I didn't want to come again and requested for the procedure to be done at the earliest. The dentist was very friendly, explained all details every step of the way, and made sure I was completely relaxed. The procedures were done in 2 hours time. Very very happy with the doctor.

All the doctors working in here are efficiently qualified and work as a team to deliver the best results to our patients. It has also been noted that you haven't turned up for our follow up visits which we recommend. You also booked for appointments yourself and didn't turn up.

She has taken out the fear from me because of her expertise. I would always recommend her to all my friends. And moreover the after removal steps she mentioned was very helpful. I didn't feel any pain though its been 6 days as of today. Worth the doctor to visit. Thanks Dr Mridula :)",

There is no such antibiotic in the world which will selectively kill the bad bacteria and protect your good ones. No doctor can comment on the above medicines. These are the safest and commonest medicine in dentistry.Ask your doctor to talk to me, I will brush their medicine knowledge.  If you were having any issues with the medicine,you should have called me or informed me.

Dr Mridula placed implant just after my tooth extraction by herself. Very helpful and professional staff; specially doctor is highly professional and experienced. I met one very old age couple who use to come from Noida for dental treatment. They keep on visiting Bangalore and do treatment by Dr Mridula only. Before coming to Avishi Dental, I visited one more clinic nearby but I was not satisfied after first consultation. Now I feel I made right decision. My personal experience, for any major surgery it\u2019s better to consult more than one doctor.*",

But last week i got to see doctor Mridula..She was highly professional and did my treatment with so much patience..moreover she made sure that the work was done on time as I had a flight to catch on the same day. I was very pleased with the outcome. Thank you so much Doctor..",

But the doctor took very great care not to break my tooth into two pieces.With extreme patience, she has managed to extract it in one piece\n\nAnd post the session, the way she has explained Do's and Dont's...... I already started to feel better already\n\nI would definitely recommend to everyone",

In one day itself she placed all the implants and my mother is absolutely fine. There was pain initially because of implant treatment but after sometime everything gone well. they don't only do treatment they take proper care even after that. Me and my mother  are very much satisfied with treatment and level of hygiene and professionalism. Highly recommend.",

So I visited to Avishi dental as referred by my neighbor.\nHere dr mridula checked me and told my wisdom tooth is giving me problem which I can't see in my mouth .she showed me in x ray and suggested tooth removal I was in pain so I told her to do immediately what ever can relieve my pain.she removed my tooth. I am ok now after a week she called me to cut my stitches . Very confident and good doctor highly recommended. I was planning to give 4.5 star because my treatment started after 10 min but again that was because of ongoing treatment of previous treatment.",

She prescribed meds over phone and it brought down swelling and pain and after coming back to Bangalore I got the full treatment done. Costs was also less compared to my previous experience at other places in Bangalore. Doc is very experienced and would recommend her to all my family and friends.",

She is friendly and explains each process while she carries out the treatment. I saw few kids getting treated happily talking with her. My treatment got completed in 1 week and was inexpensive.

After seeing your negative recommendation and reviews, we checked our records and found the bills, x-rays etc. 9 filling has been done and 2 RCT and 1post n core. RCT is some time painful if your thresh hold level is high for anesthesia. \nWhen you came to our clinic, you were blaming earlier doctor for bad treatment etc. It seems like it's your habit to blame the doctor instead of follow the doctors instructions.We clearly mentioned to you to maintain proper hygiene and revisit to cleaning done by dentist every 3 months, else nothing will stay. We have done perfect RCT , as we have x-ray of post and pre rct. \nYou can't always blame doctors when you are responsible for your hygienic conditions. front tooth filling was very large and in trauma bite with lower tooth i told you clearly if its not staying get your teeth align or get a permanent cap.\nand one more time suggesting to Practo, that attach these reviews from patients with patients profile. So that other doctors also can see the patient's concerns and doctor's reply on that.\n It will be helpful for all. \n regards \navishi dental world.",

I've always had this gut wrenching fear about going to the dentist, but after my first visit at Avishi Dental world, I can honestly say I look forward to my appointments. \r\n\r\nMy first visit with Dr. Mridula was my first dental appointment in years- needless to say I was a bit nervous. One of his dental hygienists performed X-rays & my  cleaning. She made me feel so at ease. It felt like I was talking to a friend of mine, even though she was cleaning my teeth! When it was time for Dr. Mridula to exam me, the comfort level remained the same. She was extremely knowledgeable about my dental work & answered ALL of my questions with ease. \r\n\r\nI couldn't be happier with the comfort and quality of work Dr. Mridula and his staff provided during my visit. I plan on returning in the near future to get started on care of my gum problem. I trust that Avishi Dental Care can give me the confidence that I need with my dental work! I highly recommend Dr. Mridula to anyone who is looking for a quality, comfortable dental experience.",

I really got frustrated due to the multiple appointments as there were specialists coming for each procedure. Even after so much of visits and getting it done from specialists the treatment had failed in a year. Later I visited Avishi Dental Clinic. Here Dr.  Mridula performs all the treatment by her self and finishes multiple visit work in single sitting itself.  That was quite impressive.  Within a day of treatment my mother was completely satisfied by the way the doctor handled her. Even though the charges are on a little higher side but she deserves it for the quality of work she does. I am very happy to have visited Dr.  Mridula.  Thank you doctor.",

Orthodontic treatments span across a certain amount of time and you always wanted to rush with the treatment. This was the same when we initiated the treatment for you and within a mere span of 2 months you were miraculously expecting results and without even raising a concern with us you ended up putting a negative review. Post this we made you understand the entire procedure to which you complied and you yourself took the review down. Due to the current situation we could not schedule cases that is not an emergency but we made sure to keep following up with our patients. But you were impatient even after the specialist recommending for the treatment to go along for some more months. You willingly took initiative to cessate the treatment gleefully saying that you were happy with the treatment done. We prioritize on making treatments as conservative as possible thereby retaining natural teeth. Your profile was impossible to be corrected without extractions. You yourself can compare your profiles now to how drastic the change has been. Atleast you could have raised a concern with us instead of happily going and repeating the same behaviour. Regards.",

We have explained all the procedure and implant also. Your attendant were insisting more about prognoses and outcome. This tooth we couldn't say good prognoses case. and even other doctor also cant say how long this tooth will survive\nI think you didn't get what i was trying to do. Moreover i was trying to save your tooth. As i believe in restorative dentistry. \n\nSome times doctors receive urgent calls while taking X-Ray and talking with patients. Not during surgical procedures. That is even more dangerous for doctors to use phone after wards.",

I saw improvements  in few months. After 4 months now my braces has been fixed. I am happy with the treatment going on. Thanks Dr Mridula and Dr Chandrasekar \nHighly recommended for braces",

You have not taken any treatment since then. Your  front 2 teeth were broken in 3 pieces. So i have explained you to get it operated and get prosthesis done. \nI have explained you expenses and treatment to be done. You only said that you will give us a call. \nIt should have been treated as you met with accident. No pre medication was required as it happened long back now the treatment has to be done. I am treating as per patient condition not as per patient.\n\nRegards,\nDr Mridula",

Also appointment time is not you procedure start timing. If doctor is treating other patients you should respect it. As same way you expect that doctor should treat you.\nWhy you came to \"all off the place\" after checking the location while booking appointment?? Just to put negative review it seems. \nNot sure what vibes you need, doctor consulted you  and told you all about your issues, even xray has been shared with you.You took prescription and left.\n\nAgain request to Practo to attach these reviews with patients profile so that other Dr will also come to know and keep positive vibes.\nRegards\nAvishi Dental World",

First thing she tried to do was save my tooth but damage was so bad that she recommended me root canal treatment. She is not atall a money minting doctor she will try her best to save your tooth and give you sanctification as patient. She did root canal for me and it was very clean , painless and wonderfully done. I am so happy with her treatment, that my family and many of friends have visited her. She always keep you informed about each step of treatment .I would highly recommend this doctor. Even if someone have made your case go bad , Dr. Mridula can fix it.   ",

But you insisted for the same day procedure. We told you that Dr Mridula is busy. We asked you to wait and all the procedures and charges was told you upfront. You should have been walked out. Not sure why you have opted for it just to write negative reviews it seems.\nAlso it was not a tiny filling, front tooth fillings comes under aesthetic as it has to polished.\nDr gave 45min for composite filling of 2 front tooth and we didn't charge extra for consultation, xray etc. Also here no one under training all doctors are experienced And the doctor who treated you is 5yr plus experienced doctor.\nRegards\nAvishi Dental world",

As a dentist it is our duty to explain and educate you with all the concerns in your oral cavity along with your chief complaint. Therefore, the consultation was regarding the same. Hereafter the decision is solely yours on what treatment you would like to proceed with. We never force any treatment on any patients but yes we do educate them. Owing to the current situation we are bearing all the expenses of the protective standards that we need to maintain for the sole reason of the safety of our patients. The consultation charges were already known to you when you booked an appointment for yourself and that is all that you have paid. Anyways do let us know if there is anything we can help you with. Regards!",
