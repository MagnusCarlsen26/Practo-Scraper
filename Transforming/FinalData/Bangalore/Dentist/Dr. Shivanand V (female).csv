"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Invisalign Orthodontics,",0,0,YES,"Iam currently at 9 months through my Invisalign treatment journey with SmileAlign Clinic, and the experience has exceeded my expectations.

Dr Shivananda is very patient, gentle and comprehensive in his treatment. While I was initially concerned about the level of compliance required for Invisalign to be effective, integrating it into part of my daily routine has turned out to be straightforward after the first couple of months from starting the treatment. In my experience, inculcating the habit (of removing/replacing aligners during mealtimes) is relatively easy once it has been formed.

My full treatment is estimated to take around 2 years, but I am already seeing significant gains, especially on my front teeth. Side benefits of Invisalign include (a) tremendous improvement in health of my gums with the increased attention and guidance from Dr Shivananda, and (b) greater attention in keeping to regular mealtimes (and avoiding snacks in between!).

Prices for both Invisalign and generic dental treatments are also very competitive / reasonable, in my opinion. I would highly recommend SmileAlign Clinic as a one-stop solution for any dental and orthodontic procedures.",2021-02-08 16:27:02,False,True,Anshul Srivatsava,,,

Throughout the two extractions in an hour, one was a very delicate surgery, Dr. Rathna handled it very gracefully. She gave me enough breathing space and helped in reducing my stress.

My treatment included implants, root canal surgery, bridges and crowns and the cost of this has been an enormous saving over what it would have cost in the UK.

",2020-05-22 13:47:21,False,False,Rasbina,"Dear Rasbina,

Thank you for your valuable feedback.
At the outset we would like to thank you for a positive acknowledgement on your previous treatment experiences with us. At the same time, we are unhappy to know that you were disappointed with the charges this time although you did not take the treatment from us. 

The current COVID crisis is a testing and trying one not just for patients and doctors but most of the population. More so for dentists especially as they have to work in the oral cavity and risk is as much as 100% transmission chances if a positive COVID patient is encountered. Since our screening protocols are strict we are sure that we might not encounter a “sick” COVID patient but there could be certain ASYMPTOMATIC COVID patients who show absolutely normal characteristics and parameters in the screening regulations. Hence we have to follow protocols set by the Government of India, Dental Council of India and Health & Family Welfare, Karnataka State inorder to safeguard and minimize the transmission of the disease to the patients, doctors, associate staff and the community at large.
To implement this, we will require DISPOSABLE Personal Protective Equipments (PPE). Some of them are:
1.	Non woven coverall gown ( For doctor and assistant)
2.	N95 masks (For doctor and assistant)
3.	Protective eyewear (For doctor and assistant)
4.	Face shield (For doctor and assistant)
5.	Additional 3ply masks and gloves

So the additional charges enforced upon you were for the above. These cost around Rs 1000-1500 for the good quality and the Government approved ones. A simple Google search will enable you to confirm and have a basic idea on costs of these in the market. The same was actually added along with the procedure cost to you. The procedure cost was unchanged from last time when you had approached us in the month of February. 

I hope you now understand the reason behind the increase in the costs which inturn is because of increase in the costs of the PPEs. We have already written a mail to the Government of Karnataka to help us curb the corruption which exists in certain sectors who are making using of the situation and are increasing the cost of the PPEs by 200-300%. Hopefully we get a positive and a hasty response. In the meantine, We would want to affirm and ensure that patient, staff and community safety is of prime importance to us at this crucial juncture and will continue to follow the protocols that is safe and accurate.

Thanks & regards,
