It was like she knew exactly what to do... didnt lose any time asked me whats wrong. Gave me a painkiller and called the specialist in front of me. She even kept the clinic open when the specialist got late.
Tooth was pulled out quickly she checked again on the xray if it was out fully.
I had maybe a small swelling which went away in a day.
Ive been to other dentists before who just give lectures and tell to come on another day after giving medicines. Dr Karishma has a no-nonsense approach and got the job done.",2022-10-13 05:44:21,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
