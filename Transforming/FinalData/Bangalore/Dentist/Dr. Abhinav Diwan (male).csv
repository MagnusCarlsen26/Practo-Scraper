Mine was a complicated case with multiple tooth extractions, root canals and advanced periodontal disease and severe crowding of teeth.  Sir explained me the entire treatment procedure in detail. Initially I was extremely anxious and scared to start the treatment. But Sir calmed my nerves and eased my anxiety at every step. Treatment was mostly painless. Sir would answer all my queries with great patience. He motivated me at every step and the final results are extremely satisfactory. I have had complete smile makeover and my gums are much  healthier than before. Infact the entire team of Family dental care clinic is extremely supportive. Thankyou Abhinav Sir.
