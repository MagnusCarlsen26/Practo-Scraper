My journey with Dr. Sharon began 15 years ago when I sought her expertise for a root canal and crown procedure. Remarkably, the crown she provided lasted a phenomenal 15 years, far surpassing the expected lifespan of 7 years. This alone speaks volumes about Dr. Sharon's proficiency and commitment to her patients' long-term oral health.\n\nReturning to Dr. Sharon for the implant procedure, I was once again impressed by her exceptional skill and efficiency. From the moment I walked into her office, I felt reassured by her warm demeanor and confident approach. Dr. Sharon meticulously explained every aspect of the implant process, ensuring that I felt fully informed and comfortable throughout.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Sharon apart is her unparalleled speed and efficiency in performing the implant procedure. In my opinion, she is unmatched in her field, delivering results with remarkable precision and swiftness. The implant she provided not only looks incredibly natural but also functions flawlessly, enhancing both my smile and confidence.\n\nI must also commend the entire team at Life Time Dental for their professionalism and dedication to patient care. From the receptionists to the dental assistants, everyone contributed to making my experience seamless and enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sharon and Life Time Dental to anyone seeking top-notch dental care in Bengaluru. Dr. Sharon's exceptional skill, coupled with her dedication to patient satisfaction, makes her the go-to dentist for anyone in need of dental implants or other procedures. Thank you, Dr. Sharon, for your outstanding service and for restoring my smile with the fastest and most efficient implant in the country!",

Obviously, I was very apprehensive of visiting the clinic given the current situation and tried to defer the visit for long. I had cancelled my appointment once before finally making up my mind to see the doctor. I stepped into the clinic with lot of notions and concerns about being safe however within few minutes of my visit to clinic, all of those concerns were swept off. Upon my entry, they asked me to wear a shoe cover and sanitize my hands. They took temperature reading and a pulse oximeter reading and then asked me to remove my mask and place it in a paper bag to avoid any contamination. After all this, I could see the doctor. The doctor listened to my problem with patience and intent, took some X-rays and started the treatment. The doctor who treated me was wearing masks, face-shield, and a PPE kit as a precautionary measure to ensure safety vice-versa.  The doctors were very professional and my whole experience of visiting the clinic was just wonderful.",

That's why I decided to visit her again for removal of another impacted wisdom tooth. Since I had travelled from a place 2600 kilometres from her clinic and I just had a day to stay in Bangalore, I decided to get RCT, bleaching and scaling too along with extraction. She is very helpful and she made sure that everything was done on time with no delay at all. All the procedures were done seamlessly. My brother who is very much scared of RCTs got 3 RCTs done at her clinic and he didn't even realise how smoothly it was done. Next time if he ever has to visit a dentist, he said he is going to her clinic straight away and I totally agree with him !",

My journey with Dr. Sharon began 15 years ago when I sought her expertise for a root canal and crown procedure. Remarkably, the crown she provided lasted a phenomenal 15 years, far surpassing the expected lifespan of 7 years. This alone speaks volumes about Dr. Sharon's proficiency and commitment to her patients' long-term oral health.\n\nReturning to Dr. Sharon for the implant procedure, I was once again impressed by her exceptional skill and efficiency. From the moment I walked into her office, I felt reassured by her warm demeanor and confident approach. Dr. Sharon meticulously explained every aspect of the implant process, ensuring that I felt fully informed and comfortable throughout.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr. Sharon apart is her unparalleled speed and efficiency in performing the implant procedure. In my opinion, she is unmatched in her field, delivering results with remarkable precision and swiftness. The implant she provided not only looks incredibly natural but also functions flawlessly, enhancing both my smile and confidence.\n\nI must also commend the entire team at Life Time Dental for their professionalism and dedication to patient care. From the receptionists to the dental assistants, everyone contributed to making my experience seamless and enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sharon and Life Time Dental to anyone seeking top-notch dental care in Bengaluru. Dr. Sharon's exceptional skill, coupled with her dedication to patient satisfaction, makes her the go-to dentist for anyone in need of dental implants or other procedures. Thank you, Dr. Sharon, for your outstanding service and for restoring my smile with the fastest and most efficient implant in the country!",

Obviously, I was very apprehensive of visiting the clinic given the current situation and tried to defer the visit for long. I had cancelled my appointment once before finally making up my mind to see the doctor. I stepped into the clinic with lot of notions and concerns about being safe however within few minutes of my visit to clinic, all of those concerns were swept off. Upon my entry, they asked me to wear a shoe cover and sanitize my hands. They took temperature reading and a pulse oximeter reading and then asked me to remove my mask and place it in a paper bag to avoid any contamination. After all this, I could see the doctor. The doctor listened to my problem with patience and intent, took some X-rays and started the treatment. The doctor who treated me was wearing masks, face-shield, and a PPE kit as a precautionary measure to ensure safety vice-versa.  The doctors were very professional and my whole experience of visiting the clinic was just wonderful.",

That's why I decided to visit her again for removal of another impacted wisdom tooth. Since I had travelled from a place 2600 kilometres from her clinic and I just had a day to stay in Bangalore, I decided to get RCT, bleaching and scaling too along with extraction. She is very helpful and she made sure that everything was done on time with no delay at all. All the procedures were done seamlessly. My brother who is very much scared of RCTs got 3 RCTs done at her clinic and he didn't even realise how smoothly it was done. Next time if he ever has to visit a dentist, he said he is going to her clinic straight away and I totally agree with him !",

She gave me other options like extraction/bridge etc.but all of them were over costly and needed the operation. She wanted me to undergo the treatment right away with no concern; or to look at the possibility of any alternative treatment which is not this harsh. I came home did gargal with warm slat water which was recommended by some other doctor earlier and it worked just fine. Its been over 4 months and i never had the toothache again. So, I would say it's little costly here.",

When I visited the clinic, I was really impressed the way they are maintaining all the precautionary measures not only to safeguard patients but also the doctors and staff. All the doctors and staff are truly professional, ethical and friendly. It was beyond one could imagine or see in normal clinic or hospital, especially during these Pandemic times. This encouraged me to get the treatment done right away. I am thankful to Dr Sharon & her team of experts for providing such a wonderful experience while treating my dental issues. I would strongly recommend and urge everyone to visit this clinic for any dental related issues.",

I live in the SF bay area and was nervous about seeing a different dentist than my regular one back home that I've been going to for over a decade (and had a bad experience with a dentist in India on the last trip).  However, Dr Sharon's practice is top notch and all the services I received were delivered with exceptional skill and for a fraction of the cost (cleaning, xrays, crown replacements and root canal).  The xray equipment and the crown quality are actually better than the standard insurance covered ones back in the US.  The dentists and endodontists communicate well, get patient buy-in, are kind and compassionate, and most importantly they are well experienced and highly skilled.  This is an efficiently run practice where appointments times are punctual and the front desk is warm and welcoming.  I would not hesitate to return to this clinic or recommend it to anyone.",

Thankfully i dint do a thing except cleaning and took second opinion from another dentist who made me confident that neither was needed. My thousands were saved.Go for small treatments and cleaning not for major works. Please beware. Dont trust blindky, take second opinion or third before spending money. Clinic is really clean and modern. Doctor is  friendly but her juniors handle you. But doubt is,Only costliest alternative were given to me. Not the one to conserve the tooth. O",
