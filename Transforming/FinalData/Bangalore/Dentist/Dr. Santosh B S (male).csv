"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Implant / RCT,",0,0,YES,"I had an issue with 3 teeth, after being exposed to cavity for a very long time, these teeth started decaying and at the end only the roots remained with the gum. I was unable to chew anything from that side. I was afraid of injections in my gum as I felt it to be very sensitive hence I delayed my visit to dentists. But the major problem came when I was about to get married and if I tried to smile for any of the pre wedding photoshoot, my pictures will appear very weird due to the missing teeth and I didn't like it. 
That's the time when I approached Dr. Santhosh and Dr. Shilpa. I explained them about my issue and my fear of infections. First, they analyzed the teeth by doing an x-ray and then explained all the possible solutions with time period from the begining till the end. I felt relaxed and was confident to start the process. They also kept us informed about all the other options if I am too afraid of the treatment. But, I was ready as I had faith on them for their knowledge and the way they were handling my case. It took multiple sittings to remove the roots from the missing teeth, let the gum heal. As I was nearing my wedding date, I wanted to get it done soon and I discussed this with them. They suggested about immediate implant after a CBCT of my bone in the gum to see if it is safe to do it sooner or not. And they were able to. I was so happy.
It's been 6 months of my treatment and my implants are still doing good, I didn't face any problem yet. And if I face, i am sure, I can depend on these 2 doctors at any point of time.
P.S -  always had a trust issue on finding a good doctor who will understand my problem and genuinely help me instead of demanding a lot of money from me and consider me a merely an opportunity for cash.
