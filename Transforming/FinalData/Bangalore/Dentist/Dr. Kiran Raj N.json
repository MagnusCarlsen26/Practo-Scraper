Post undergoing the procedure I had no issues the very same day. It was indeed a big miracle and my family was quite shocked at the outcome. Highly recommend him for people who fear visiting a dentist, he would make your life so much so earlier and also super light on your pocket.\nI was amazed at his consultation and procedure charges. It's hard to believe, that we can still avail quality services at such economical rates.\n",

He even convinced me that Root canal treatments are pain free and made me feel confident to go ahead for the root canal treatment . The myth and scaredness\u200b of injections were broken then day Dr.Kiran Raj started RCT treatment on my tooth. He administered anesthesia injection painlessly, RCT was done in 2 visits, he explained me each procedures step by step, shows me the X-rays, showed me all the sterilized files and instrument he used. And I got my cosmetic zirconia crown/ cap also done from him. I would recommend Dr.Kiran to all. ** ** ********** *** **** ******* *** *** ** *",

Post undergoing the procedure I had no issues the very same day. It was indeed a big miracle and my family was quite shocked at the outcome. Highly recommend him for people who fear visiting a dentist, he would make your life so much so earlier and also super light on your pocket.\nI was amazed at his consultation and procedure charges. It's hard to believe, that we can still avail quality services at such economical rates.\n",

The myth and scaredness\u200b of injections were broken then day Dr.Kiran Raj started RCT treatment on my tooth. He administered anesthesia injection painlessly, RCT was done in 2 visits, he explained me each procedures step by step, shows me the X-rays, showed me all the sterilized files and instrument he used.
