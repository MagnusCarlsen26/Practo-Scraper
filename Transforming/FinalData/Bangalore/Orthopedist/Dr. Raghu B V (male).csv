,,0,0,YES,"He has magic in his hands. ** *********** ********* ** **************** *** ***** ** ** ******. I was having issues with my left knee for the longest time.... Was advised kneee replacement surgery by other doctors and hospitals.... He didn't recommend it and treated my knee without me being touched by a knife.
He's extremely patient with his patients. Very polite, Listens keenly n then treats the issue. He makes sure there is a female assistant when his patient is a lady. 
It takes me close to 2hours 1way to visit his hospital since I stay at Horamavu.... But the journey was worth it.
God continue to bless and guide his work.
