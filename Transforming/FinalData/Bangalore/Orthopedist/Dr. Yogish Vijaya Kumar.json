Dr. Yogish patiently listened to the progression of the muscle problem and all its symptoms before doing a thorough physical examination. The onsite X-Ray facility at the clinic is very convenient and helps in quick diagnosis, making the entire experience quite seamless. We found Dr. Yogish to be quite informative and professional. He answered every question entirely, using terms that we understood clearly. ",
