But the moment I consulted Dr. Raghu, I knew I was in right hands. He was extremely calm, professional and made the right judgement for my case. I underwent MPFL surgery- ligament reconstruction surgery and the doctor did the surgery perfectly and also the rehabilitation plan which included his team of physiotherapists went perfectly well and I recovered very quickly. His entire team - Meenu, Nithya etc were very professional and helpful. I am very grateful towards Dr. Raghu. I would definitely recommend him to other patients.",

It took 4.5 months for me to get back after healing and to normal activities. Meanwhile, I have referred my friends and took my parents, father-in-law and the outcome was so good.\n\nEventually, 2 months back I had sports injury again, and had ACL reconstruction and Meniscus Bucket Tear Repair surgery. I went back again to Dr. Raghu and outcome was as expected. With his expertise in counselling, consultation and keep patient motivated, helped me to recover with fast pace. Even I have watched my knee surgery live and saw the nature of surgery and efficacy involved. I would like to highly recommend Dr. Raghu Nagraj. Thanks !",

Meanwhile, I have referred my friends and took my parents, father-in-law and the outcome was so good.\n\nEventually, 2 months back I had sports injury again, and had ACL reconstruction and Meniscus Bucket Tear Repair surgery. I went back again to Dr. Raghu and outcome was as expected. With his expertise in counselling, consultation and keep patient motivated, helped me to recover with fast pace. Even I have watched my knee surgery live and saw the nature of surgery and efficacy involved. I would like to highly recommend Dr. Raghu Nagraj. Thanks !",

My kid is all fine and happy now, back to her normal playful life.\n\nDr Sreejith(Physiotherapist), a cheerful and helpful person who made my kid feel very comfortable with every session. He used to check with us on her progress and ask her if she is doing her exercises every day. He was also concerned about the pain after the sessions but luckily, she didn\u2019t face any pain. She was very happy and was eagerly waiting to meet him for her sessions.\n\nWe also met doctor\u2019s manager Meenu mam, who is very approachable, supportive and helped us in all our queries and communications with the doctors.\nWe are very happy with my kid\u2019s speedy recovery by the efforts of this wonderful team and heartfelt thanks to Dr. Raghu Nagaraj, Dr Sreejith (Physiotherapist) and Meenu mam, for being helpful and guiding us through this journey of recovery.",

                "review_text": "Initially i had conversion with Dr.Raghu Nagaraj to know about TKR operation in detail and also about the cost for doing that .Raghu sir is down to earth, even though in his busy schedule he explained about TKR n gave his secretary number for more details.Later we met directly to meenu mam(secretary). She is very calm n cool person.The way of response from her was very satisfactory. That mainly made us to go under TKR operation at fortis cunningham road hospital.Even had a convertion with a different manager or secretary (Ramya manager, orthopedic)From the same hospital but different location(bannerugatta) was totally unsatisfactory.So we come to the conclusion n did a TKR operation for my mom at fortis, cunningham road.Now my mom is walking indepedentally without any support. Thanks to doctor Raghu Nagaraj.Special thanks to meenu madam because she guided properly about insurance claim, hospital procedures that really helped us a lot.",

So I  requested him to listen to my treatment explanation first so that he or you shouldn\u2019t get confused in the treatment and take it in a wrong way leading to incomplete treatment . I asked himTo ask his doubts later again though I had listened to him for a long time\nEarlier .
