The report revealed a complete tear of my right knee ligament. Sir patiently explained each and every question that my father asked with same way even thought its silly one and provided lot of confidence to my father, including the need for ACL reconstruction surgery and the precautions before and after the procedure. We proceeded with the surgery at the hospital and went successful. Sir provided excellent care and monitroing daily 2-3 times. He is very kind and friendly, suggested simple tablets and referred me to a Physiotherapist by taking extra care and explained about my surgery details. I highly recommend him for any orthopedic concerns.",

This may have to with issues with age and other bone related issues. \n\nOur main concern was weather to go for Ankle fusion if it does not heal completely. \n\nDoctor was patient to listen to all the history and explained issues with fusion and asked to continue with few exercises and confirmed that it might take more time heal.\n\nOne more thing I liked was to give few  tips to me and suggest physio for my shoulder pain without extra fee.",

The diagnosis was quick, he advised us for an MRI suspect the issue and later explained us clearly from the reports as to what has happened and what kind of surgery will be required. But above all what makes Dr. Shivareddy an ideal doctor is his humble and courteous nature towards the patient and his family, he was in direct contact with us and helped us with the insurance, admission process etc making it so easy for us. Its about that one touch which heals and gives confidence, for this we would like to thank the doctor and recommend him to others. ",

But receptionist didn't allow me to get in and was preferring some other walk in patient. Doctor protectively came out and called me at right time, which allowed me to complete my other planned works later.\nClinic needs to educate receptionists to allow patients who have the booking and address in time to clinic, else it beats meaning of booked appointment.\n",

Two years old son got injured and not able to stand and walk properly after a week also. Antibiotic was running a week 3 times a day, its suggested by pedestrian. We got scared and decided to consult orthopedist. Doctor did the check up and gave suggestion continue the observation and took the x-ray \"knee AP and lateral\" and consulted again. Doctor suggested to continue the same medicine 2 times a day for next 3days as it's light fracture. Followed the same and now baby is good, walking well. Thank you for valuable suggestion and direction. \n",
