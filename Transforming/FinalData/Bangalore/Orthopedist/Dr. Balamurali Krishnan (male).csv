"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Knee Replacement,Osteoarthritis Of The Knee,",0,0,YES,"I had my knee replacement surgery, done on August 3rd 2022 at Manipal Hospital Sarjapur Road, Bangalore. The surgery was done by Dr. Balamurali Krishnan. I am glad to say that I am immensely satisfied with the results and I would like to share my experience for the benefit of others.
When I first consulted Dr. Balamurali Krishnan in December 2021, I had two major issues. Chronic arthritic pain and my right leg was shorter than the left leg, forcing me to limp. My first impression was that I had come to the right person for treatment. Dr. Balamurali Krishnan patiently explained the issues I was having, the procedure he would be performing (if I decide to go ahead with surgery) and what outcome to expect. He was very realistic about the outcome. 

After surgery, the arthritic pain is totally gone, and the shortening is very minimal, For the 1st time in many years, I am able to walk without a limp.  I would like to thank Dr. Balamurali Krishnan for the excellent work that he has done. I also would like to thank his team members, Dr. Deepak, Dr. Rohit, Dr. Idris, Dr Razi and the hospital support staff. They were very friendly and very easy to approach with any queries and concerns throughout the treatment period. A good team indeed. 

Finally, about the hospital, the overall service and infrastructure were top class
I would definitely recommend Dr Bala & his team

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Fracture Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I suffered from femur fracture in 2017 and by God's grace, my colleagues took me to Dr. Balamurali Krishnan. Intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fracture was done by him and the same nail was removed successfully in 2019. I am back to as normal as I was before. He is a very charismatic and expert doctor. His patience, confidence, explanation, experience, and expertise is something which will make you recover better and quicker. I am very much grateful to him and thank him for everything. Unable to visit due to the Covid-19 situation. Will definitely visit him once things are back to normal again. Thank you, doctor.
