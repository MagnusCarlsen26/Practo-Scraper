She had both her knees operated on and on two separate occasions as she did not want both knees to be operated at the same time. As I live half way across the globe and due to work constraints, I was unable to be with her and had to rely on the extended family's support. But more importantly, I wanted to know that she was going to the right doctor! Based on family and friends recommendation, I had strongly suggested to mom that she go to a different doctor. I had even met the 'other' doctor (who shall remain unnamed). But she had a good friend and a neighbor who had recently had the same operation successfully completed by Dr. Sharath and so mom felt very inclined to go to this doctor. I was very apprehensive and so I decided to talk to the doctor (over the phone). I had a list of questions for the doctor to which the doctor very patiently answered and gave me such a good feeling that I too was convinced that mom had made the right choice in this doctor! All from 10,000 miles away. So, fast forward 6 months, following two total knee replacement surgery, which the doctor has informed me is called as staggered as it was operated on with a time gap of about 6 months in-between, mom is currently recovering from her 2nd TKR and the doctor is so amazing that I am so very humbled by his approach to his patients and their family. He is so concerned for his patients well being and genuinely a very good doctor. I recommend him highly and will continue to sing his praises to everyone that will listen. I wish Dr. Sharath and his family the best of everything that life has to offer. Thank you doc!",

I had great difficulties walking, sitting, lying down & even travelling. Walking was very embarrassing, coz I had developed a limp gradually without realizing.  I had to quit my work due, in ability to travel.\n\nAfter consulting several surgeons in Bangalore, I was referred to Dr Sharath in Ramaiah Hospital. He was very kind and offered to consult, though it was not his day for Consultation.\n\nHe just went through my X-ray, immediately gave me a date for admission and surgery. And said very confidently, these exact words \u201cI\u2019ll fix it\u201d.\n\nI went through the surgery in Ramaiah Hospital on the 31st of August 2019. And he kept his word, fixed me both physically & mentally. I recovered swiftly, comparatively and doing great since September 2019. I\u2019m back to my regular life and activities, I didn\u2019t go through any kind of post operative pain or stress or physiotherapy just followed up with the recommended out patient consultations and care.\n\nDr. Sharath K Ramanath in his \u201cProfession is Perfection @ it\u2019s BEST\u201d.\n\nI wish him well with his Future Accomplishments.\n\n\nRegards\nRabi\n*** **** *** *** ***** *********\n\n",

She had both her knees operated on and on two separate occasions as she did not want both knees to be operated at the same time. As I live half way across the globe and due to work constraints, I was unable to be with her and had to rely on the extended family's support. But more importantly, I wanted to know that she was going to the right doctor! Based on family and friends recommendation, I had strongly suggested to mom that she go to a different doctor. I had even met the 'other' doctor (who shall remain unnamed). But she had a good friend and a neighbor who had recently had the same operation successfully completed by Dr. Sharath and so mom felt very inclined to go to this doctor. I was very apprehensive and so I decided to talk to the doctor (over the phone). I had a list of questions for the doctor to which the doctor very patiently answered and gave me such a good feeling that I too was convinced that mom had made the right choice in this doctor! All from 10,000 miles away. So, fast forward 6 months, following two total knee replacement surgery, which the doctor has informed me is called as staggered as it was operated on with a time gap of about 6 months in-between, mom is currently recovering from her 2nd TKR and the doctor is so amazing that I am so very humbled by his approach to his patients and their family. He is so concerned for his patients well being and genuinely a very good doctor. I recommend him highly and will continue to sing his praises to everyone that will listen. I wish Dr. Sharath and his family the best of everything that life has to offer. Thank you doc!",

I had great difficulties walking, sitting, lying down & even travelling. Walking was very embarrassing, coz I had developed a limp gradually without realizing.  I had to quit my work due, in ability to travel.\n\nAfter consulting several surgeons in Bangalore, I was referred to Dr Sharath in Ramaiah Hospital. He was very kind and offered to consult, though it was not his day for Consultation.\n\nHe just went through my X-ray, immediately gave me a date for admission and surgery. And said very confidently, these exact words \u201cI\u2019ll fix it\u201d.\n\nI went through the surgery in Ramaiah Hospital on the 31st of August 2019. And he kept his word, fixed me both physically & mentally. I recovered swiftly, comparatively and doing great since September 2019. I\u2019m back to my regular life and activities, I didn\u2019t go through any kind of post operative pain or stress or physiotherapy just followed up with the recommended out patient consultations and care.\n\nDr. Sharath K Ramanath in his \u201cProfession is Perfection @ it\u2019s BEST\u201d.\n\nI wish him well with his Future Accomplishments.\n\n\nRegards\nRabi\n*** **** *** *** ***** *********\n\n",
