We did consult doctors in the past and had discussed about it including options of going for a surgery. However, we kept on postponing it. The last dislocation for me happened in August 2021 and it was quite severe. This is the time we had an opportunity to consult Dr. Sai Krishna B Naidu (Orthopedist, Sparsh Hospital, Yeshwanthpur, Bangalore). He examined me thoroughly and suggested a MRI. After analyzing the report, he explained us in detail the situation and status of my shoulder joint. I was diagnosed to have left shoulder Anteroinferior Bankart\u2019s lesion + Hill Sachs lesion. Dr. Sai Krishna recommended to go for Arthroscopy of Shoulder. He explained us clearly about the course of treatment and its benefits and gave us the confidence. We were very convinced and clear; and decided to go for the Shoulder Arthroscopy. Dr. Sai Krishna and his team did a fantastic job and the surgery was very successful. After all my sessions of Physiotherapy now I am very comfortable, relieved and glad. Dr. Sai Krishna is very friendly and approachable. He listens to all our queries patiently and answers them! He is very caring.\nAfter having done the Arthroscopy, now I feel that I took a great decision to go for it; and of course, I was very fortunate to have Dr. Sai Krishna doing it. We are very thankful to him.\nBased on my extremely good experience, I would recommend going for Arthroscopy for anyone with similar problems with shoulder without prolonging it. Dr. Sai Krishna would take a very good care. **** *** *** **** *** *** ******** *********** *** *** ** *** **** ******",

                "review_text": "I had a problem of my left shoulder getting dislocated for over past two decades. We did consult doctors in the past and had discussed about it including options of going for a surgery. However, we kept on postponing it. The last dislocation for me happened in August 2021 and it was quite severe. This is the time we had an opportunity to consult Dr. Sai Krishna B Naidu (Orthopedist, Sparsh Hospital, Yeshwanthpur, Bangalore). He examined me thoroughly and suggested a MRI. After analyzing the report, he explained us in detail the situation and status of my shoulder joint. I was diagnosed to have left shoulder Anteroinferior Bankart\u2019s lesion + Hill Sachs lesion. Dr. Sai Krishna recommended to go for Arthroscopy of Shoulder. He explained us clearly about the course of treatment and its benefits and gave us the confidence. We were very convinced and clear; and decided to go for the Shoulder Arthroscopy. Dr. Sai Krishna and his team did a fantastic job and the surgery was very successful. After all my sessions of Physiotherapy now I am very comfortable, relieved and glad. Dr. Sai Krishna is very friendly and approachable. He listens to all our queries patiently and answers them! He is very caring.\nAfter having done the Arthroscopy, now I feel that I took a great decision to go for it; and of course, I was very fortunate to have Dr. Sai Krishna doing it. We are very thankful to him.\nBased on my extremely good experience, I would recommend going for Arthroscopy for anyone with similar problems with shoulder without prolonging it. Dr. Sai Krishna would take a very good care. **** *** *** **** *** *** ******** *********** *** *** ** *** **** ******",
