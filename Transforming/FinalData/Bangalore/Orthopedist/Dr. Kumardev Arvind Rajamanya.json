When she turned 54 her knee joints resulted in abnormal swelling and\npaining. She Used to apply different Ayurvedic oils and Ayurvedic treatment. Took continuous\npainkillers for daily relief. Her Orthopedician gave 3 maximum steroid Injections on both the\nknees. All this resulted in temporary relief only but not permanent cure. 24\u00d77 pain was felt in\nboth knees. Unable to climb steps. She stopped walking despite doctor's advice resulting into\nweight gain. She stopped doing her yoga exercises as stretching legs was no more possible.\n1. First we had consulted Orthopedicians in Mumbai (as we were there) who advised knee\ntransplantation. Thereafter we shifted to Bengaluru and since 2016 onwards we started\nconsulting different doctors for their 2nd opinions. All most all the doctors from the very\nbeginning told that she required immediate Total knee implants of both the right and left legs as\nthe cartridge of both the legs was worn out.\n2. My son searched the Internet and concluded with information gathered based on ratings of Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya, Orthopedician, Manipal hospital, Whitefield, Bengaluru. Immediately we took appointment and consulted the\nDoctor. The doctor advised immediate both the knee transplantation as it was overdue from\n2016. He also told any further delay in surgery would result into bending of legs, the deformity of\nwhich cannot be repaired thereafter. The Doctor also very positively advised that my wife can\neasily go to the US after 3 months of surgery with good home Physiotherapy.\n3. Thereafter my wife underwent detailed blood tests required by the Doctor. Dr. Kumardev attended immediately and planned surgery first for Right knee\non 05/07/2021 morning. She has been fasting since the evening of 04/07/21. On 05/07/21 morning at\n08:00 am. She was taken into Operation Theater. We were told that my wife was given total General anesthesia and the surgery would take 2-3 hours. Right knee surgery was\nsuccessfully finished by 12:00 pm. and the Doctor told that he would take up surgery of her left\nknee on 08/07/2021 based on her tolerance of pain. Thereafter in the evening, Physiotherapy\nstarted for her and she was asked to walk with crutches. She was complaining some pain under\nanesthesia effect. But later in the evening and next day it was more. But by 07/07/2021 night\nThe pain got reduced and got ready for left knee surgery on 08/07/21. Accordingly, she was\noperated her Right knee on 08/07/21. Thereafter she was in the hospital for 5 days. She did\nphysiotherapy in the morning and night. She was discharged after that with instructions to\nundergo home physiotherapy for 3 months. We utilized the services of Mr. Jyothi Kiran,\nPhysiotherapist, Manipal hospital, Whitefield who was daily morning and evening used to visit\nour house and made my wife alright. He is a thorough professional in physiotherapy.\n4. Our interactions with Dr. Kumardev during this period was outstanding. His timely, deeply and\nadvice helped my wife to gain total confidence. She started walking at home\nwith the support of a physiotherapist for 2 months. But started walking independently without\ncrutches and others support. She was fully alright by 30/09/2021\nand we were happily ready to go to the USA from 08/10/2021.\n5. During 6 months of her USA stay, she visited various tourist places there and walked freely\nforgetting her pain that was there prior to surgery.\n6. During my wife's hospital stay we found that the staff attended her were highly educative and\nhelpful.",

                "review_text": "My Dad Mr. Y.S Bhat (aged 80 years) was suffering from knee pain from the last 7-8 years. Although it started with minimal pain in the initial years, it aggravated to unbearable pain in the last couple of years affecting his mobility in the recent months. Starting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Allopathy, etc. he tried almost all the therapies available to get relief from the pain \u2013 nothing really worked! Surgery was the last option on his mind - due to the apprehension of surgery, hospitalization, post-surgery recovery/dependency, success rate, fright, age, etc. \n\nWhen it almost reached an ultimatum, surgery was the only choice. Search began for the **** doctor and hospital with proved track record; finally was referred to Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya by our cousin Dr. Manjunath Bhat. While the reviews on the net were very encouraging, our first consultation with the Doctor further boosted our optimism, assurance, and trust to proceed with the surgery. His patient hearing (answering to every small question/clarifying doubts),  thorough examination, transparent/genuine diagnosis, understandably explaining the medical condition/problem, and the treatment options available to rectify the issue was extremely convincing and there was no looking back. Just with a single meeting, we were won over \u2013 and were visualizing the positive side of my Dad getting to normal (all constraints seemed to be of less importance).  After all the preliminary tests and procedures, my Dad underwent the left Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery in March 2020 at the Manipal Hospital, Whitefield under the able hands of the Doctor. \n\nDr. Kumardev kept checking on us at every step pre and post-surgery. His personal attention to every patient, even with his busy schedule from the initial stage is highly commendable/exceptional as it builds a very good rapport and helps the patient to foster trust \u2013 which is very important for the success of any procedure and recovery. He explained in detail the surgery procedure and all the care we should take almost every single day. \n\nDuring our stay in the hospital, the Doctor guided the Hospital staff at every step, took personal care, and monitored all the parameters regularly. My Dad was made to walk with an aide on the second day of the surgery and was discharged from the hospital on the fourth day. Dr. Kumardev\u2019s disciplined approach, extreme expertise in his area, and continuous monitoring/care helped in the speedy recovery of my Dad\u2019s condition. Doctor gave us an elaborate list of Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts post-surgery and during discharge which helped my father and us to take care of him. It is extremely fulfilling to see my Dad recover so quickly and back to his normal activity almost within about 1.5-2 months of the surgery. With the Corona pandemic, all the post-surgery consultations were handled remotely with minimum visits to the hospital which was extremely convenient, safe, and exhibited the true concern of the Doctor towards the patient.\n\nA big THANKS to the Doctor and all credit goes to him. His friendly, caring, considerate, compassionate, approachable, responsive, down to earth nature, and connect with the patients is something very unique! Overall our experience with Dr. Kumardev and the Manipal Hospital team was extremely good. We would highly recommend Dr. Kumardev amongst all our family and friends.  ",

Sha had a fall while walking in the campus where we stay. Looking at her condition we were worried that the fracture is of very bad type. \nAnyways we called the ambulance and took her to the hospital. \nThe nearest hospital was Manipal Whitefield (Near ITPL/ Opp Prestige Shantiniketan Mall)) and we were there in emergency in under 20 minutes. There the doctors immediately took her inside and after scans confirmed the fracture. Now it was a complicated one as she was 72 years old and her bone health was bad as well. The emergency doctor directed us to Dr Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya in OPD whom I met with the scan report and he explained the surgery process and how he is going to treat her.  One thing I have to add here is that mom's accident was on a weekend and on Sundays you have very few doctors who attend to surgeries. Anyways given my mom's condition Dr Kumardev took decision to do the surgery on Sunday itself and got her moved to inpatient from emergency. Surgery was long - almost 6 hours, and it was successful. Post surgery mom had to go through a elaborate physiotherapy plan. Very happy to state that after 6 months of surgery and rehab my mom was able to walk independently. It took time given her state but throughout this journey Dr Kumardev and his team has been extremely supportive and helped me through all queries. The doctor even shared his contact details and allowed me to reach out to him for immediate queries. Who does this in today's world? \nOverall I am thankful to God that I took the decision to take my mom to Manipal Whitefield and luckily met Dr Kumardev. Thankfully my mom is back on her feet and is totally independent like she was before. \n",

Big thanks to the expert Dr Kumardev, her life got completely transformed. From the days of continuous suffering, lack of mobility, dependency on others into independence in mobility, freedom and zero pain. Here are some important points to note while preparing for knee replacement surgery: 1. Patient's readiness and positive attitude is of prime importance. Dr Kumardev is very good at councelling. His soft voice and talking from Patient's view point gives big confidence booster.2. Since most of the cases it's a planned surgery, take your time to prepare thoroughly for 5-6 days of hospitalization 3. Depending on Patient's condition, doctor will take call if to do both knee replacement on same day or stagger over 2 days. **** ***** ** ******** ** **** ******. 4. Post surgery for first few days, there will be immense pain in legs. Both Patient and care taker need to be ready, have patience and faith in doctor. Just follow what he says. 5. Post discharge, most important is to do very sincere physiotherapy for at least for 2 months. A good physiotherapist is key. We were lucky to get Ankita as physiotherapist from Manipal hospital.6. There will be some pain during physiotherapy but if patient tolerates it for few days, it will help immensely for faster recovery and complete gain back of knee movement. Once again, big thanks to Dr Kumardev, his entire team and physiotherapist Ankita for this life transformation.",

I tried my best to convince my mother to get knee transparent for past 10 years. In 2017 I was able to convinced her to come with me to Manipal hospital.\nWe did all the test and she was diagnostic with grade 4 (Last stage) arthritis. We were almost ready to get the surgery but in the last moment she backed off (Due to fear mongering by relatives)\nFour year passed and pain start growing from bad to worse. This time pain was unbearable and finally she said \"YES\" to have surgery.\n\nI decided to take her to Manipal Whitefield again. One of my friends is working in Manipal and she suggested to have consultation with Dr Kumardev. As suggested by her we consulted Dr. Kumardev and my mother was diagnostic with same grade 4 arthritis!!\nDr Kumardev explained us everything in details about her condition and suggested to go for surgery. He explained everything patiently about surgery. He gave lot of confidence to my mother and finally my mother was more confident about surgery!!\nFinally, the judgement day came and on 24-Feb-2021 left knee was operated on and 26-Feb-2021 right knee was operated on. Both the surgeries were successful and she is in much better situation now.\nIt\u2019s very important to choose the right doctor for surgeries. I would highly recommend Dr Kumardev for orthopedic related issues. He is expert in his subject and take care of his patient very well.\n\n\nNote: Physiotherapy is must after surgery otherwise surgery will not be that effective. We did physiotherapy for two-month post-surgery.",

The injury was so bad that it was extremely difficult and painful to even lift her from the floor and put on a stretcher. We arrived in Manipal Hospital, Whitefield, Bangalore for treatment and admitted her to the emergency ward initially. From there on, hospital authorities, doctors and support staff completely took ownership for treatment. She was under treatment with Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya, senior Orthopedic Surgeon at Manipal Whitefield hospital who treated her extremely well during her hospital stay and after release, for surgery and post surgery treatment. Apart from the fact that he is highly qualified and competent at his profession, doctor was always available for consultation with patient and her family, very informative and helpful for the entire duration of her treatment. I can't thank him enough for his compassion, understanding, empathy in taking care of my mother. His advice, suggestions and medication had been spot on and time bound - and within 5 months my mother is close to resuming her normal life and travelling to home town at Kolkata. Manipal Hospital had also been very professional in handling patients safety during the Covid time and we felt completely safe during multiple visits to the hospital between Mar - Sep, 2020. I will always be grateful to Dr. Kumardev Rajamanya and Manipal Hospital Whitefield for the help, care and support received during the difficult time that we faced. ",

Also his legs used to appear bent while he walks. \n\n2. There was a time where the pain has become severe and we consulted doctor Kumar Dev Rajamanya from Manipal hospital Whitefield Bangalore. He looked at the Xray and explained why the problem is happening and how it has to be treated and how the care has to be taken after the surgery.\n\n3. We went ahead with surgery in December 2019. The surgery was done separately for each knee. We were in the hospital for 10 days. The treatment and the care at the hospital was so good. Doctor used to visit my father twice every day to let us know the measures to be taken to avoid infection and how to recover faster.\n\n4. Though my father was able to walk after the second day of the surgery with support stick. After the discharge my father took rest for 10 days at home and started to practice walking and all the physio exercises. He used to walk with support stick for 20 to 30 days but with care. After which he was able to walk without any support. \n\n5. I would like to Thank doctor Kumar Dev for all the help that he did to explain the things before the treatment during the treatment and after the treatment. He was always available for us on whatsapp and phone to clear all the doubts.\n\n6. I was worried before the surgery if it is really going to help my father to be able to walk normally. Now my father is completely alright and he is very happy. Still the doctor tells us to take proper care to not get infection and asks us to make sure not to avoid stairs, sitting cross legged. Thanks to the doctor once again for all the help that he did. \n",

When she turned 54 her knee joints resulted in abnormal swelling and\npaining. She Used to apply different Ayurvedic oils and Ayurvedic treatment. Took continuous\npainkillers for daily relief. Her Orthopedician gave 3 maximum steroid Injections on both the\nknees. All this resulted in temporary relief only but not permanent cure. 24\u00d77 pain was felt in\nboth knees. Unable to climb steps. She stopped walking despite doctor's advice resulting into\nweight gain. She stopped doing her yoga exercises as stretching legs was no more possible.\n1. First we had consulted Orthopedicians in Mumbai (as we were there) who advised knee\ntransplantation. Thereafter we shifted to Bengaluru and since 2016 onwards we started\nconsulting different doctors for their 2nd opinions. All most all the doctors from the very\nbeginning told that she required immediate Total knee implants of both the right and left legs as\nthe cartridge of both the legs was worn out.\n2. My son searched the Internet and concluded with information gathered based on ratings of Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya, Orthopedician, Manipal hospital, Whitefield, Bengaluru. Immediately we took appointment and consulted the\nDoctor. The doctor advised immediate both the knee transplantation as it was overdue from\n2016. He also told any further delay in surgery would result into bending of legs, the deformity of\nwhich cannot be repaired thereafter. The Doctor also very positively advised that my wife can\neasily go to the US after 3 months of surgery with good home Physiotherapy.\n3. Thereafter my wife underwent detailed blood tests required by the Doctor. Dr. Kumardev attended immediately and planned surgery first for Right knee\non 05/07/2021 morning. She has been fasting since the evening of 04/07/21. On 05/07/21 morning at\n08:00 am. She was taken into Operation Theater. We were told that my wife was given total General anesthesia and the surgery would take 2-3 hours. Right knee surgery was\nsuccessfully finished by 12:00 pm. and the Doctor told that he would take up surgery of her left\nknee on 08/07/2021 based on her tolerance of pain. Thereafter in the evening, Physiotherapy\nstarted for her and she was asked to walk with crutches. She was complaining some pain under\nanesthesia effect. But later in the evening and next day it was more. But by 07/07/2021 night\nThe pain got reduced and got ready for left knee surgery on 08/07/21. Accordingly, she was\noperated her Right knee on 08/07/21. Thereafter she was in the hospital for 5 days. She did\nphysiotherapy in the morning and night. She was discharged after that with instructions to\nundergo home physiotherapy for 3 months. We utilized the services of Mr. Jyothi Kiran,\nPhysiotherapist, Manipal hospital, Whitefield who was daily morning and evening used to visit\nour house and made my wife alright. He is a thorough professional in physiotherapy.\n4. Our interactions with Dr. Kumardev during this period was outstanding. His timely, deeply and\nadvice helped my wife to gain total confidence. She started walking at home\nwith the support of a physiotherapist for 2 months. But started walking independently without\ncrutches and others support. She was fully alright by 30/09/2021\nand we were happily ready to go to the USA from 08/10/2021.\n5. During 6 months of her USA stay, she visited various tourist places there and walked freely\nforgetting her pain that was there prior to surgery.\n6. During my wife's hospital stay we found that the staff attended her were highly educative and\nhelpful.",

                "review_text": "My Dad Mr. Y.S Bhat (aged 80 years) was suffering from knee pain from the last 7-8 years. Although it started with minimal pain in the initial years, it aggravated to unbearable pain in the last couple of years affecting his mobility in the recent months. Starting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Allopathy, etc. he tried almost all the therapies available to get relief from the pain \u2013 nothing really worked! Surgery was the last option on his mind - due to the apprehension of surgery, hospitalization, post-surgery recovery/dependency, success rate, fright, age, etc. \n\nWhen it almost reached an ultimatum, surgery was the only choice. Search began for the **** doctor and hospital with proved track record; finally was referred to Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya by our cousin Dr. Manjunath Bhat. While the reviews on the net were very encouraging, our first consultation with the Doctor further boosted our optimism, assurance, and trust to proceed with the surgery. His patient hearing (answering to every small question/clarifying doubts),  thorough examination, transparent/genuine diagnosis, understandably explaining the medical condition/problem, and the treatment options available to rectify the issue was extremely convincing and there was no looking back. Just with a single meeting, we were won over \u2013 and were visualizing the positive side of my Dad getting to normal (all constraints seemed to be of less importance).  After all the preliminary tests and procedures, my Dad underwent the left Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery in March 2020 at the Manipal Hospital, Whitefield under the able hands of the Doctor. \n\nDr. Kumardev kept checking on us at every step pre and post-surgery. His personal attention to every patient, even with his busy schedule from the initial stage is highly commendable/exceptional as it builds a very good rapport and helps the patient to foster trust \u2013 which is very important for the success of any procedure and recovery. He explained in detail the surgery procedure and all the care we should take almost every single day. \n\nDuring our stay in the hospital, the Doctor guided the Hospital staff at every step, took personal care, and monitored all the parameters regularly. My Dad was made to walk with an aide on the second day of the surgery and was discharged from the hospital on the fourth day. Dr. Kumardev\u2019s disciplined approach, extreme expertise in his area, and continuous monitoring/care helped in the speedy recovery of my Dad\u2019s condition. Doctor gave us an elaborate list of Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts post-surgery and during discharge which helped my father and us to take care of him. It is extremely fulfilling to see my Dad recover so quickly and back to his normal activity almost within about 1.5-2 months of the surgery. With the Corona pandemic, all the post-surgery consultations were handled remotely with minimum visits to the hospital which was extremely convenient, safe, and exhibited the true concern of the Doctor towards the patient.\n\nA big THANKS to the Doctor and all credit goes to him. His friendly, caring, considerate, compassionate, approachable, responsive, down to earth nature, and connect with the patients is something very unique! Overall our experience with Dr. Kumardev and the Manipal Hospital team was extremely good. We would highly recommend Dr. Kumardev amongst all our family and friends.  ",

Sha had a fall while walking in the campus where we stay. Looking at her condition we were worried that the fracture is of very bad type. \nAnyways we called the ambulance and took her to the hospital. \nThe nearest hospital was Manipal Whitefield (Near ITPL/ Opp Prestige Shantiniketan Mall)) and we were there in emergency in under 20 minutes. There the doctors immediately took her inside and after scans confirmed the fracture. Now it was a complicated one as she was 72 years old and her bone health was bad as well. The emergency doctor directed us to Dr Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya in OPD whom I met with the scan report and he explained the surgery process and how he is going to treat her.  One thing I have to add here is that mom's accident was on a weekend and on Sundays you have very few doctors who attend to surgeries. Anyways given my mom's condition Dr Kumardev took decision to do the surgery on Sunday itself and got her moved to inpatient from emergency. Surgery was long - almost 6 hours, and it was successful. Post surgery mom had to go through a elaborate physiotherapy plan. Very happy to state that after 6 months of surgery and rehab my mom was able to walk independently. It took time given her state but throughout this journey Dr Kumardev and his team has been extremely supportive and helped me through all queries. The doctor even shared his contact details and allowed me to reach out to him for immediate queries. Who does this in today's world? \nOverall I am thankful to God that I took the decision to take my mom to Manipal Whitefield and luckily met Dr Kumardev. Thankfully my mom is back on her feet and is totally independent like she was before. \n",

Big thanks to the expert Dr Kumardev, her life got completely transformed. From the days of continuous suffering, lack of mobility, dependency on others into independence in mobility, freedom and zero pain. Here are some important points to note while preparing for knee replacement surgery: 1. Patient's readiness and positive attitude is of prime importance. Dr Kumardev is very good at councelling. His soft voice and talking from Patient's view point gives big confidence booster.2. Since most of the cases it's a planned surgery, take your time to prepare thoroughly for 5-6 days of hospitalization 3. Depending on Patient's condition, doctor will take call if to do both knee replacement on same day or stagger over 2 days. **** ***** ** ******** ** **** ******. 4. Post surgery for first few days, there will be immense pain in legs. Both Patient and care taker need to be ready, have patience and faith in doctor. Just follow what he says. 5. Post discharge, most important is to do very sincere physiotherapy for at least for 2 months. A good physiotherapist is key. We were lucky to get Ankita as physiotherapist from Manipal hospital.6. There will be some pain during physiotherapy but if patient tolerates it for few days, it will help immensely for faster recovery and complete gain back of knee movement. Once again, big thanks to Dr Kumardev, his entire team and physiotherapist Ankita for this life transformation.",

I tried my best to convince my mother to get knee transparent for past 10 years. In 2017 I was able to convinced her to come with me to Manipal hospital.\nWe did all the test and she was diagnostic with grade 4 (Last stage) arthritis. We were almost ready to get the surgery but in the last moment she backed off (Due to fear mongering by relatives)\nFour year passed and pain start growing from bad to worse. This time pain was unbearable and finally she said \"YES\" to have surgery.\n\nI decided to take her to Manipal Whitefield again. One of my friends is working in Manipal and she suggested to have consultation with Dr Kumardev. As suggested by her we consulted Dr. Kumardev and my mother was diagnostic with same grade 4 arthritis!!\nDr Kumardev explained us everything in details about her condition and suggested to go for surgery. He explained everything patiently about surgery. He gave lot of confidence to my mother and finally my mother was more confident about surgery!!\nFinally, the judgement day came and on 24-Feb-2021 left knee was operated on and 26-Feb-2021 right knee was operated on. Both the surgeries were successful and she is in much better situation now.\nIt\u2019s very important to choose the right doctor for surgeries. I would highly recommend Dr Kumardev for orthopedic related issues. He is expert in his subject and take care of his patient very well.\n\n\nNote: Physiotherapy is must after surgery otherwise surgery will not be that effective. We did physiotherapy for two-month post-surgery.",

The injury was so bad that it was extremely difficult and painful to even lift her from the floor and put on a stretcher. We arrived in Manipal Hospital, Whitefield, Bangalore for treatment and admitted her to the emergency ward initially. From there on, hospital authorities, doctors and support staff completely took ownership for treatment. She was under treatment with Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya, senior Orthopedic Surgeon at Manipal Whitefield hospital who treated her extremely well during her hospital stay and after release, for surgery and post surgery treatment. Apart from the fact that he is highly qualified and competent at his profession, doctor was always available for consultation with patient and her family, very informative and helpful for the entire duration of her treatment. I can't thank him enough for his compassion, understanding, empathy in taking care of my mother. His advice, suggestions and medication had been spot on and time bound - and within 5 months my mother is close to resuming her normal life and travelling to home town at Kolkata. Manipal Hospital had also been very professional in handling patients safety during the Covid time and we felt completely safe during multiple visits to the hospital between Mar - Sep, 2020. I will always be grateful to Dr. Kumardev Rajamanya and Manipal Hospital Whitefield for the help, care and support received during the difficult time that we faced. ",

Also his legs used to appear bent while he walks. \n\n2. There was a time where the pain has become severe and we consulted doctor Kumar Dev Rajamanya from Manipal hospital Whitefield Bangalore. He looked at the Xray and explained why the problem is happening and how it has to be treated and how the care has to be taken after the surgery.\n\n3. We went ahead with surgery in December 2019. The surgery was done separately for each knee. We were in the hospital for 10 days. The treatment and the care at the hospital was so good. Doctor used to visit my father twice every day to let us know the measures to be taken to avoid infection and how to recover faster.\n\n4. Though my father was able to walk after the second day of the surgery with support stick. After the discharge my father took rest for 10 days at home and started to practice walking and all the physio exercises. He used to walk with support stick for 20 to 30 days but with care. After which he was able to walk without any support. \n\n5. I would like to Thank doctor Kumar Dev for all the help that he did to explain the things before the treatment during the treatment and after the treatment. He was always available for us on whatsapp and phone to clear all the doubts.\n\n6. I was worried before the surgery if it is really going to help my father to be able to walk normally. Now my father is completely alright and he is very happy. Still the doctor tells us to take proper care to not get infection and asks us to make sure not to avoid stairs, sitting cross legged. Thanks to the doctor once again for all the help that he did. \n",

                "review_text": "Few months back, my kid (4yrs) fell down in school while playing & his left elbow got swollen. Initially we thought it might be just joint dislocation & we took him to nearest hospital for first aid. School administration has provided the contact details of Dr. Kumardev to take second opinion on the criticality. As he working in Manipal hospital Whitefield, I thought he won't respond to us over phone call or thru whatsapp msg so easily. But surprisingly, he is really cool. He understood our situation, asked me to share the x-ray images & the reports over whatsapp. Then he provided his opinion that my kid's elbow had a fracture which can be corrected thru minor surgery. Then he also talked to the doctor who was doing first aid to my kid. Explained him what needs to be done until visiting Manipal. Since it was around 10PM, he asked us to observe in the night for any complications, if so asked us to visit hospital immediately, else asked us to bring our kid in the morning. We visited hospital next day early morning, Doctor already informed the facility for admission. Everything went very well with Doctor & the hospital. Surgery also went smooth. As it was the k-wire which they inserted into my kid's elbow to correct the position, there was one more follow up surgery to remove those wires. Initially we were scared regarding surgery & it's results. But everything went very well. We visited many times after the surgery to have a follow up consultation. Finally my kid elbow is normal as before. We are happy to see him doing everything as other kids. Thank you so much Dr. Kumardev for your special care towards the patients visiting you. You are not only giving treatment but also giving hope & moral support to their family. Which is really important for the one who visit any doctor. Thank you so much. I have also recommended you for many of my friends. ",

                "review_text": "I was looking for best possible orthopaedic treatment for my mother\u2019s elbow fracture after it became too complicated. She had to undergo two surgeries in last 18 months after she fell down on road and broke her ulna and radius. Unfortunately, her first surgery was done at a substandard hospital in Kanpur and ended up in implant failure, the second surgery was done at a better hospital and she was recovering but she fell down again and broke the implant while the ulna fracture was still non-union after 16 months of refixation.I had met Dr. Kumardev a month prior to this while he was treating my cousin who was admitted to Manipal hospital in emergency after a road accident. My cousin was recovering well after the major patella surgery and he had a very positive experience with Dr. Kumardev, so he asked me to discuss my mother\u2019s case with him. I sent him details of the case on whatsapp and took his opinion on phone all, he recognised me and discussed his treatment plan at length, I asked him about cost estimate as well and I was convinced to call my parents to Bangalore for surgery.This third procedure was so much more complex when compared to last two, as it involved removal of broken implant, non-union surgery and bone grafting. Fortunately, everything went as planned by Dr. Kumardev and my mother was discharged within 2 days of the admission.\u2028Dr was very serious about postoperative care and he prescribed best possible medicines to manage pain, ensure reunion and avoid any possible infection. He personally inspected the surgical wound on each followup visit until staples were removed.\u2028\u2028Apart from being a very talented orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Kumardev is a great human being too, he gives ample time to patients, tries to understand their problems and also explains about the treatment in detail. He is very approachable and extremely cooperative.When it comes to financial aspect of treatment, he understands patient\u2019s perspective as well. He helped me genuinely in the insurance claim process.I strongly recommend Dr. Kumardev.",

He is kind enough to explain the purpose of each test that is required. It gave us lot of confidence and increased credibility on doctor.\n \nHe initially performed surgery for left knee in the early morning. My mother shifted to room by afternoon. Doctor and Physiotherapist visited my mom in the evening and made her walk a little. We never expected that she could walk within hours of surgery. It gave us lot of confidence.\n \nThat\u2019s when mother decided to go ahead with right knee joint replacement also. Doctor performed surgery for right knee on third day of admission. Thanks to Doctor for taking it step by step and infusing confidence in us with not only with his words, but also with his actions.\n \nWe were in hospital for 1 week, doctor or his junior doctors used to visit us everyday and use to check the progress and perform dressing.\n \nWe opted for Physiotherapy sessions at home from Manipal, Whitefield. He gets all information from Physiotherapist on daily basis and suggests next steps. \n\nA discharge, doctor is always available on WhatsApp for any suggestions/ change in medicines/ Checking the progress of healing. Stitches were removed after 20 days of surgery.\n\nOverall it is best experience that we had with Dr Kumardev. My mother is quite happy with surgery and she is more confident.",

Despite that it resulted in a major injury because of the whole burden of my body weight. Post my elbow reduction, I did a research on whom to consult for the recovery. Thankfully Dr. Arvind's name came across.  There was a lot of fear and anxiety already on my mind regarding my ability to be at the same level of earlier fitness. However, after meeting him he gave me a candid review of the situation and the possibilities  in which the recovery may go in future. During the multiple sessions, he had been extremely careful open yet honest about the situation in hand.  What i liked the most is his entire approach to keep things simple without inducing a sense of fear. To a certain extent with the help of his motivation, I was psychologically more  geared up to put my effort towards the physiotherapy process.  In the beginning my dislocation also created a ligament injury and a certain extra bone growth. With the help of his suggested medication and methodological approach, I have healed mostly with the complete range of movement. My extra bone growth has also disappeared. In future also he will my remain go-to doctor for any orthopaedic related issues. My trust was further reinforced with his step by step approach. Feels good to get an opportunity 2 write a good review after long time. Meet him without any second thoughts if you have any orthopaedic or similar issues, you can thank me later :) ",

The pain was excrutiating and we felt extremely helpless as we rushed her to the Manipal Whitefield emergency. Dr Kumardev examined her and very quickly diagnosed that the peculiar and rare nature of the fracture was due to the condition of osteoporosis combined with bisphosphonate medication issues which had made her bones extremely brittle. He recommended surgery. He also proactively diagnosed that there was another weak point on her right Femur which would soon lead to a similar fracture if unattended. He recommended surgery for both the Femurs. His ability to beautifully articulate the issues and the procedures step by step with a lot of patience helped us understand and feel comfortable that the right direction was being taken. He even guided us to papers written by the clinical community for this rare issue. We had by then realised that this was a very rare kind of fracture and there were not too many case studies. We prayed for the best. Dr Kumardev handled both the surgeries personally and with a lot of care and sensitivity to our frequent doubts and questions. The post surgery care and follow ups were also very nicely handled by him and his lovely team. We have been going for follow ups to him for over a year and a half now and every visit is filled with the exact situation explained beautifully, a lot of positivity and a personal touch. He has also been very open to us reaching out to him on whatsapp and phone over the last 1.5 years each time giving us a patient listening and the right directions. We are extremely grateful that we were in such able and caring hands. Now my mother is back to her completely normal self.\nA special thanks to him and his team. God bless him as continues to help folks get back on their feet and use their limbs and bones to the fullest.",

He was very patient in explaining the entire process and the impact. During further investigations it was identified that the surgery will not be straightforward as due to years of damage and one limb shorter than other, due to which the regular adult implant could not be fitted, so Dr planned ahead and ordered the one which could fit with required modifications. He had to use the custom set up for the implant and was proactive in ensuring right measurement are done, the surgery went well and my Mother was on the way to recovery in the next 2 months. She followed this with 4 months of physio and m glad to say she's feeling better than ever, a lady who could not walk for more than 10 mins without feeling extra pain is now working out 30 mins a day, is going for regular swimming. I have full faith in Dr Arvind and how he handled this complex case. ",

My sister Nita Jindal had issues with left/right knee and she used to bend while walking. My brother and my bother in law are Doctors, my BIL used to show her in Varanasi and all Doctors advised for knee replacement. I advised them to show her to Dr. Kumar Dev once in Bangalore, post her visit to Doctor and after careful evaluation Doctor advised to get hip xray done as she was bending from 1 side. In xray it came that left hip was totally screwed. Post multiple meetings finally we went ahead with Dr. Kumar Dev for hip replacement and it was amazing decesion. He will guide you at each and every step ( both pre and post procedure). Doctor will make sure you are totally comfortable, give you best advise and assist you at each step with all care and details. Post 2 month we went again for right knee replacement and it was also successful. Recently post 4 months we went for followup and now my sister is all good, able to walk all straight. Thanks to Dr. Kumar Dev for all the help and support during 7 months long journey.",

He is an outstanding orthopaedic surgeon who not only possesses remarkable expertise but also exhibits immense compassion and dedication towards his young patients.\n\nFrom the moment we met him, Dr. Kumardev made us feel at ease. He took the time to thoroughly explain the injury, the treatment options, and the potential outcomes, ensuring we fully understood the situation and helped alleviate any anxiety he had about the procedure.\n\nThe surgical procedure performed by Dr. Kumardev was executed flawlessly, resulting in an optimal outcome. Post-surgery, he continued to closely monitor my son's progress and conducted regular follow-up appointments to ensure his recovery was on track.\n\nThanks to Dr. Kumardev\u2019s expertise and compassionate care, my son's recovery has been remarkable. His elbow has regained full functionality, and he is back to School( as per the the condition it was not looking possible to return within 4-5 months). We are forever grateful for the impact Dr. Kumardev has had on our son's life.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Kumardev to everyone who needs an orthopaedic surgeon for their child or any other family members.",

My mother was having knee pain and discomfort for any long time and tried various alternative but without much relief. She consulted many doctors for knee replacement related alternative but when last year she visited us to Bangalore, we took her to Dr Kumardev and as usual he explained her procedure for TKR in details and also post surgery procedure and care and what to expect. Right through from first appointment and up till post-Ops care, he with his team took good care, very supportive and ever reachable for any issues. Within 3 month of her surgery, she was back to normal day routine and traveled back as well. Now almost a year post her procedure, she walks and carry her daily routine like before.  I highly recommend Dr Kumardev for his attentiveness, patient care and support he provide throughout which gives lot of confidence to yourself and good care. ",

The doctor suggested knee replacement at the time only, but my father was not that confident enough to have the operation.\u00a0 Over those 2 years according to the doctor's prediction, the pain continued to worsen and worsen even after having multiple pain medications. As a matter of fact, we came back to the Dr, Kumardev after two years, and had bilateral knee replacement surgery on both knees in\u00a01st week of July'22.\u00a0His excellent surgery and counseling skill with the patient and patients-family members made everything very smooth. The surgery was extremely successful. Our heartfelt thanks to Dr Kumerdev for his excellent treatment during and after the surgery which gave a new life to my father at 72. I recommend anyone suffering from knee joint pain, please consult with Dr Kumardev without further delay.",

And after 3\u20134-year latter the pain started increasing gradually and I started taking painkillers to avoid pain and the way I walked was changed and one and half year back this increased so much that I was not able to stand for 5-10 minutes cause of pain. Then after I decided to get my knee replacement done and I got the reference of doctor Kumardev from my cousin's daughter as he did knee replacement of her in-law as well. So, I consulted him and after seeing my x-ray suggested to get both of my knee replacement done, cause my right knee was almost damaged as I used to put all my pressure on my right knee to avoid pain of my left knee. \nIn the starting of Jan 22, I got my surgery done by Dr. Kumardev. And his team was extremely helpful and careful during whole surgery process and after surgery process.\nAnd now after 9 month I am so much happy and thankful. I am doing all my work as I used to do before, driving car, scooter, walking 1-2 KM and I am extremely thankful to Dr. Kumardev. I\u2019ll will recommend him as well.\n",

We had been visiting various doctors for the past 10 years for my mom's knee problem. Every doctor had correctly suggested for knee replacement but somehow my mom never got the confidence to undergo this surgery until we met Dr. Kumardev on 21st March 2022. After the first meeting itself my mother was ready for an instant surgery which we got done on 1st April 2022. Given her extreme deteriorated knee conditions Dr. Kumardev gave her enough positivity and made her meet few of his patients who had already undergone a successful surgery. The whole approach of the doctor to have an instant connect with his patients and let them make the decision of when they would be ready for the surgery was a game changer in our case. There was no hurry no push which gave us confidence. From the 1st day we walked into his consultation room until today the whole experience has been smooth and effortless. From the 2nd month itself my mom started taking long walks and doing her regular recommended exercise. No day passes by when she doesn't thank Dr. kumardev for this new pain free life. \n\nWe can't thank you enough for the special, excellent care you have provided and for the unique gift you are to your patients.\u201d\n\n",

He gave us the confidence that she is under good hands and will recover quick. True to his diagnosis, surgery went well and she was discharged in 2 days. We were so happy with the service we received at the hospital. Dr. Kumardev was very kind to respond to us on phone inspite of his busy schedule and address our queries post surgery. My mother was very happy with the service and kind behavior she received from the doctor. Today she is doing absolutely fine and we thank God that we met Dr Kumardev at the right time. ",

I visited Manipal hospital and consulted Dr. Kumardev. He explained me the severity of my fracture, the treatment process and he also helped me to have my insurance claim fast tracked. He is a polite person and I found him more of a friend than a doctor though out the process.\n\nI had to go through OT, metal implants for 6 weeks and a subsequent process of implants removal. With this, fractured bones got joined and it couldn't have been any better.  My bother is a doctor and he appreciated the perfection that was achieved in fixing my fratures dislocation. \nAll this was achieved without any additional cut on my skin and without feeling a significant pain in this entire duration. During hospital admission, I interacted with few of his patient and everyone appreciated his expertize.\nIf you're seeking any consultation on Orthepedic, I'd suggest to consult him at-least once or as a second opinion least. \nWish you a faster recovery if you're going through a consultantion.\n",

After checking the reports Doctor advised knee replacement surgery for my father, however, the doctor informed my father that this surgery was only needed to improve his quality of life as my father's movements were restricted.  My father was hesitant, owning to corona we postponed the thought of surgery until May 2022. Finally, once my father after multiple opinions from various other doctors decided to go ahead with the same.  We zeroed in on this doctor mainly on the positive feedback on Practo and the detailed explanation of the procedure and the risks involved by the doctor.  Once my father was cleared for the operation the same was scheduled to suit our schedule and TKR was completed on both knees in 2 operations that were carried out with three days gap. Both the operations were completed successfully and after monitoring the process we were discharged 8 days post our joining. \n\nMy father is now in the recovery stage. He is healing well and the post-operation care and the support and guidance provided by the doctor were excellent. He personally visited and passed on detailed instructions to take care of the recovery process during various stages of post-operation and post-discharge.  \n\nCurrently, my father is making progress and undergoing physio sessions, I hope to add to the review in a month or two about his return to normalcy journey ",

When the accident occurred I was rushed into a nearby hospital where my initial surgery did not go well and I was constantly experiencing pain in my hand for 2 years. My bone was not joined and it was cross.\n\nThen one of my relatives referred me to Dr Kumardev and I'm glad that I visited him. He went through my xray and my previous treatment file and suggested that I go through nonunion fracture forearm with plates and screws and bone grafting surgery. He explained me all the risks and gave me time to understand completely what I would be going through. He was really patient to clear all my doubts and questions. The surgery went really well and my follow-ups post surgery have been great. \nIt's been almost 3 and half months since my resurgery. I got my Xray done 2 days back and the happy news is my bone is joining and the gap between it is reduced.I'm really grateful to Dr Kumardev for treating me and helping me get well.",

And we are indeed in touch with him once in a while and have been referring friends and relatives related to orthopaedic related treatment. I just want to highlight some of the experiences which we had with doctor 1) Dr Kumardev is very polite and softspoken 2) He listens to all our questions and answers with patience 3) He shared a whatsapp no with us which definitely helped in reducing the visits to hospital 4) When my mother is in ward he visits the ward frequently to check how she is doing 5) He is very friendly and approachable anytime 6) He understands the problem and gives right treatment. To summarize overall I had a postivie experience with Dr. Kumardev and even my mother is happy post surgery. Thank you doctor for your services and keep continuing.",

Dr. Kumardev helped us understand the impact of the accident and procedures he recommends as course of action. We understood complete process and was happy to know that he will be operating it next day. It was a 4 hours long operation and 2 plates were placed, one in my wrist and another in the elbow. Post operation, Dr. Kumardev and his team would visit twice daily to check on the progress.\nPost discharge, I used to visit him very 2 weeks for consultation and could feel the progress also evidently.\n\nHappy to inform, that I can now move my left hand normally. He is a great motivator as he is a great doctor.\n\nI would and have been recommending him to all my family and friends. ",

We admitted her in care of Dr. Kumardev in Manipal hospital during late March this year. When we met him the first time, with great empathy and patience he explained the complete details of the surgery.  The surgery was successfully completed with implants and nails as there were multiple fractures. \nDue to the pandemic and lockdown most of the hospitals were not doing surgery unless it was life critical and there were serious challenges in procuring the hi-quality metal implants required for the surgery and we could have been held up for days. With Dr Kumardev\u2019s help and tremendous efforts, the hospital was managed to get the appropriate implants in a day. During and post surgery, the support that doctor has provided is exceptional. It's been almost 4 months post surgery, my mother-in-law is all fine now and able to do the tasks on her own and walk with minimal support. We went for physio only couple of times during which the, the doctor was present and guided us.\nDr Kumardev is highly experienced, ************* *** versed with the latest update in orthopaedics. Most important he takes personal interest and care, always responsive which is extremely important during the treatment and recovery. We completely trust Dr. Kumardev and its a privilege to recommend him for any Orthopaedic related treatment.\nWe are ever thankful to Dr, Kumardev Rajamanya",

We were very scared  to see his forearm hanging at half as both the forearm bones were broken and completely dislocated.We got a recomendation to visit Dr.Kumardev who is working at  Manipal Hospitals,Whitefield. We were in literal stress about our Son's arm thinking about the scars,his future till we spoke with Dr.Kumardev. But the relief we got after speaking with him cannot be described in words. He explains the things to us in such a manner that it really motivates us.Apart from the medical/Surgical procedure which is his expertise, the way he spoke to my kid and explained him about the procedure before the surgery is really commendable. We have never seen Dr.Kumardev without a smile which shows the confindence in what he is doing.\nIf you see my Son's hand now we dont even realize that surgery has happened to him. There is not even a scar of 1 inch on his hand which shows his accuracy.\nSir, Thanks a lot once again and you will be remembered forever and may god bless you a longlife with health,wealth and prosperity.\n\nRegards\nSreevalli and R Karthik K",

I went to the doctor few weeks after my injury, thinking of some minor injury, which turned out to be a very bad one, high grade ACL tear, caught in MRI. Dr. kumardev initially advised for physiotherapy for few weeks, and then suggested to have it operated. This was very much anxious time for me as I was not sure if I would be able to go back to sports again. However,  the doctor promised that surgery and good physiotherapy would make things the same as earlier. Before surgery he talked to my family as well to convey the importance of physiotherapy. My family and I were much convinced that I was in good hands. The doctor always is so attentive to what I say, so calm and elaborate while explaining stuff, it creates a positiveness in the situation. His team at the Manipal hospital, Whitefield is very good,  my father said, who is an orthopedic doctor himself.  The surgery went well. Physiotherapy started within a few days after surgery. It's been 6 months after that now, I have started running again. The doctor says my recovery is going satisfactorily. I hope to get fully well soon.",

Sir also explained the procedure in detail with all the post surgery benefits and probable implications during post surgery recovery period.He has taken care of my father in law very well considering 75 yrs aged with history of cardiac problem,even he used to do the dressing also by himself with atmost care. It's been now more than a year since my father had knee replacement surgery by Dr.Kumardev and he is doing excellent without any problems.My father also having some pain in other knee but sir suggested not to do surgery and wait for alternative options and that makes a different than most of the medical practitioner today who push for surgery which I have seen a very common practice now a days.

I consulted two other doctors before and after Dr. Kumardev and finally opted Manipal Whitefield to get the TRP done. Dr. Kumardev is a very gentle *** ************* ******* He doesn't suggest unnecessary medicines and instead focus on overall well-being and recovery. \nThe total knee replacement operation went smooth and my father started mobilizing after 4 days of being operated. \nToday after 5 months of recovery, he is doing well and we are still in touch with Dr. Over phone and he give his consultation without hesitation.\n\nDoctor is really very good but I also want to point out that Manipal Whitefield is not the best in terms of nurses/staffs. Numerous times I have to ask for small things for the patient and can only be resolved after Dr intervene. But probably every hospital is like that. \n\nI would strongly suggest Dr. Kumardev Aravind for Ortho related problems.\n\nThank you doctor for all your support and good consultation for my father.",

From the very first consultation until post-surgery care, Dr. Kumardev has been straightforward, practical and helpful. What we hold in high regard is that he remembers his patients, and their exact concerns. In addition, he takes the time to explain, in depth, what the issue is, and what the most appropriate plan of action should be - including pros and cons. In this past year, we have visited him regularly, and followed his recommendations to the T, including regular physiotherapy. The result is that the patient is back on his feet, and the knee back to (almost) normal. I have in fact recommended him to friends and acquaintances, who also have had only good things to say about Dr. Kumardev. A doctor who is ************** experienced, patient and honest is hard to come by these days. Dr. Kumardev is one of them. Thank you Doctor!",

Since the condition of my mother is worsening gradually and I was afraid of her condition, I started exploring   hospitals and doctors in Bangalore. We  have also met few doctors along with Dr. Kumardev Arvind, Finally we decided to go with Dr Kumar Dev for mainly , the way he started looking at the issue and briefing about the current condition of the patient and  surgery , treatment ,physiotherapy/ healing . He also explained that if required we may have to go for extra road based on the bone strength/quality.  Doctor also spoke more practical on healing and timelines. I mean he has not given any high expectations on speedy recovery , So finally the left knee surgery took place on 27th January ,2020, since the condition of the bone was not good and extra road also installed , next day with the support my mother was able to start her walk!  We got discharged on 4th day after surgery!  Since my mother had  problem with another knee also, we decided to go for  second knee replacement  early Mar-20 based on the doctors advise and my convenience ,   this time   the quality of bone /strength of the bone was good , so the extra road was not installed. We have also observed the second surgery healing was much faster. Doctor was easily accessible at times when we need support. I really appreciate for his time. Now my mum is normally walking, and she is self.  Doctor also helped us in various administrative matters inside, which really helped us during this time.",

Dr. Kumar Dev explained about the fracture that has happened and advised fracture fixation with Intramedullary nail (Insertion of rod inside broken thigh bone). Next day post the accident, the operation was carried out for fracture fixation and broken bones were perfectly aligned. Truly I felt very lucky that I got right treatment on right time. Dr. Kumar Dev is very patient and explains every procedure in-detail, that's the most important thing which I liked very much. . Even the Doctor was available on what's app for any clarifications and doubts anytime.\n\nDuring the follow-up consultations, I was diagnosed that the fracture healing is taking more time which was a Delayed Union. Dr. Kumar Dev advised immediate Nail Dynamization (Removal of static screw of the implant). As advised I had undergone Nail Dynamization, which in turn improved the healing process drastically and now the fracture is healed (the broken bone is now connected with new bone tissue). I was very happy and was very grateful to Dr. Kumar Dev for advising right treatment on right time\n\nI personally also I liked Dr. Kumar Dev very much for his perfection, the patience and the way he explains the current state of injury and following treatment which is required.\n\nAm very thankful to Dr. Kumar Dev for helping me to get back to my normal life as earlier.\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Kumar Dev for all orthopedics related treatments.",

He was screaming in pain when we reached Manipal Hospital Whitefield ,in the emergency ward. He was promptly attended by hospital emergency staff and they called the Orthopedic team  immediately which is  lead by Dr Kumardev Rajamanya, who fixed the dislocation on time. The injury was pretty bad , with some his bones in pieces.  It was  Christmas holiday and I had low hopes on that any senior doctor would be available, but on call from the hospital Dr Kumardev visited us.  We were extremely tensed but Dr Kumardev assured us everything will alright and explained the entire treatment procedure.\n  Dr Kumardev exhibits extreme patience and understanding with patients and was available in whatspp and calls throughout the treatment, and  is surprising to see that he remembers the patient's details so accurately which is very rare at his  senior level. Very impressed with his humbleness and modesty, he treats everyone with respect and dignity and that  results in his team being highly efficient.\nThe Surgery was conducted on time by Dr Kumardev and his team  and the pain management was well taken care of and  the result-my husband was back on his feet walking normally in 3+ months. Another point to note, the well o-ordinated staff in Manipal specially all sisters, which never made feel  me anxious as a lone woman in this situation. The Private rooms in the hospital are well set up and have excellent facilities.\nWe are thankful beyond words to Dr Kumardev and his team.\nI would  strongly recommend Dr Kumardev for any ortho issues , doctor of high standards and is gifted with magical hands for any kind of  surgery.\n",

Kumardev sir and team for whom I m really greatful about.\n\nI under went two surgeries in Whitefield hospital , both done by Kumar Dev sir. \nThat is knee arthroscopic surgery and tendon repair surgery. Kumardev sir is one humble and kind person who helped just like my own brother starting from the day one when I went with the my thumb tendon injury to the day it got completely recovered. His style of patient hearing to what I say and his way of explaining things about what is their plan and what has happened and how it would heal was simply superb. My thumb had lost its movement completely. It was all his efforts that made me fit and perfect today. That four hours of surgery for the tender repair was really showcasing the efforts that he put for which I m fine today. He also took help from Dr. Ramani sir who is a plastic surgeon so that their are not more scars on my hand.\n\nI visited regularly and his suggestions an guidance and constant care helped me to recover my thumb movement.\nI don't know how much I m greatful to doctor Kumardev sir. \n\nAfter undergoing one surgery under him, I decided to fix leg injury which was pending from long time. He did that as well with utmost care and recently after the knee surgery , I did complete a Himalayan trek which was for nine days. Now I feel more confident. Again that to kumardev sir and Manipal team. \n\nOne more important thing is that I could handle this all alone is because of Kumardev sir. He has helped me even to during the cashelss insurance process though he was on leave that day. That is the level dedication he has for his pateiens and work. \nThank you sir. \n",

Local physician gave one tetawak and suggested to go for an xray. After scanning my right shoulder, got to know my collarbone got fractured broken into 3 pieces  :( bad day in my life. Before meeting my favorite doctor l, went to two other doctors one of them as suggested to wear a shoulder band not even pop and other doctor was so rough and arrogant felt he was an RMP doctor.\\n             On the next day took an appointment with Dr.kumardev rajamanya, alot of doctors don't realize how important it is to have administration like kumardev. The first point of contact is crucial! Started speaking to him of what was happened and we (me and my friend) spoke almost for 30mins. I know I was out of my mind when he suggested to undergo on clavicle surgery after that hearing started asking a bunch of questions, with so due and respect he was answering for all of my pointless and innocence questions. He was the person who took me to administration block with a smile in his face and putting his hand on my shoulders  ( Really I felt my brother was next to me). Its March 20th, I went under surgery and he suggested his friend who he also from the same orthopedic family because needed to go my hometown to recover. He has given his personal no got any contact which most of the doctor afraid or ignores to share it. He is to reply for every message of mine (\\\"Caring of his patients <3\\\"). At last I was completely recovered and fine by his beautiful treatment,  good part is I skipped having tablets for almost 6months ( Daily 2 I.e., 360 tabs) \\ud83d\\ude0b\\n           Finally there is one more doctor which I want to thank is Dr.Hari Kishore, I used to call him ANNA( means elder brother) and he is such a lovely person.\\n           \\*** **** ** *** *** ** ********* *** ******* *** ** ******* ****** Dr.kumardev Rajamanya is the man, **** ****** ****",

Had to under go 2 surgeries, 1st one to set my feet straight, once the swelling reduced the 2nd surgery went very well. Doctor used to talk to me when i was getting operated and explaining what they were doing which i felt was very good when i was awake (i used to sleep in between, ha ha ha). He is very positive and takes time for the wound to heal and does the surgery perfectly. I should my x-ray to my physiotherapist and other doctors and everyone said it was a perfect surgery. Each visit after the surgery he recognizes and explains me how the bone is healing and make you feel comfortable. Currently I am doing my swimming, playing cricket, walking almost 90% perfectly. There is no option to upload photos and videos else I would have posted them. Thank you again Dr Kumardev sir for treating me. ",

It's like a new birth for him.\nI highly recommend doctor Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya is very helpful ,listing all problems very patiently and he is full of positive vibes .",

He guided us step by step on post operation procedures and exercises.  He ensures to have a very friendly relationship with patient and their family and this helps in preparing well for surgery and post surgery period as well.\nI will definitely recommend Dr Kumardev for any kind of orthopaedic treatment.",

You not only cared for her, but us as well and we cannot thank you enough for that. After 10 days, you helped my Mom walk again, she was an exceptional case of Rheumatoid arthritis and the risk was high for a knee replacement surgery, but the confidence Doctor gave was exceptional and we cannot be more thankful.\nI would say Doctor Kumardev is not only a great Surgeon but surely a wonderful person too.\nWe would have never been able to go for high risk surgery if we had not found a Doctor like him.\n\nI am blessed to see my Mom walking again.\nThank you",

He is easily reachable over phone and watsapp after the surgery which I loved about him the most. He will help you out anytime and the behaviour of his team is very good. The thing I liked most that he will educate you about everything so you can cross check if everything is done in order since he cannot be around everytime.

We  decided to change doctor and visited Manipal hospital for follow up visits and consulted Dr Kumardev. He saw the latest x-ray and suggested to go for plate fixation based on severity of fracture. He did explain in detail pros and cons of having surgery vs natural healing process. As it was dominant hand, decided to go for surgery. Entire process from consultation till surgery was smooth. Dr is very helpful and attentive towards his patients. He was always available to clear any doubts we had.  I got my clavicle surgery done by Dr Kumardev. He is amazing surgeon. Never had any issues post surgery. I had speedy recovery after operation, shoulder movement is improved a lot. I am very much satisfied with his treatment and would highly recommend him for anyone looking for orthopedic needs.",

My brother followed his suggestion quite fully and he got recovered almost in a very minimal time. I would like to thanks Dr Arvind for his kind behaviours and attention towards us. I visited many times, but I never found him in a hurry. He always gives enough time to the patient to understand the issue and then explain everything in detail. We are very much satisfied with his treatment and I will always recommend him in case of orthopaedic need.",

He was detailed in providing explanations and proceeded with due diligence. The X-Ray reports on the level of correction that happened post-surgery were stupendous. Post-surgery follow-ups taking care to connect and provide guidance to the physiotherapist was ensured. I was really satisfied with his professionalism.

We had to rush to the hospital after about ten days after the fall, due to severe pain. Dr Kumardev immediately identified the problem with some diagnostic tests and has explained the impact of the fracture in great detail. Despite being such a busy doctor that he is, he took pains to make sure we are reassured that, a surgery is not necessary and it was a blessing given the advanced age of the mother. He shared his mobile number, and was constantly available for any clarifications and questions we had. Despite other complications such as osteoporosis and associated weakness of the bones, my mother recovered well due to expert advise and treatment from Dr Kumardev.\n\nI am thankful to Dr Kumardev and would highly recommend him for any orthopedic issues.",

Doctor was very kind enough to visit my mother at casualty and did the needful.  Next day Doctor operated my mother. My mother had severe osteoporosis and surgery was a difficult thing but yet Dr Kumardev Arvind sir completed the procedure without any complications. And we were back home in 5 days. Throughout our stay he was very patient with all our queries and helped my mother recover faster. We were so happy with my mother's recovery that we went back to him again when my mother required bilateral Knee Replacement. He did the surgery of Bilateral Knee Replacement without any complications. **** *** ********** * *** *** **** ** ** ** ********* ********** ******* *** an equally graceful human being.

After Removing my plaster, he always advised me for doing lot of knee exercise at home instead of sending to Physio department to avoid more exposure with regards to Covid 19. I am very much thankful to him for his advises, Great help and care. One thing I can say that Dr Arvind is the best Doctor ever I consulted for any kind of bone related problems.Even I consulted him for my mother, with few tablets and the exercises my mother got relief from her very old leg pain (due to Nerve). I have met many Doctors before for other Rheumatic problems but never found such a kind and competent doctor yet.Hats off to him, and Thanks a lot Dr. Arvind for your kind advises and care.",

My husband and our entire family were highly impressed which his excellent quality was evaluating the patient\u2019s condition and to come up with prefect solutions. He doesn\u2019t rushes to big procedures nor make hasty decisions. He does step by step procedures after detail examining. He underwent 2 stage surgical procedures: 1st surgery was with an external fixator and 2nd surgery with plates and screws.\nDuring the course of treatment, he used ask for frequent updates on his patient via Whatsapp/Emails. His friendly nature is also an extra add on to keep the patients and their families motivated!! \nToday we share healthy relationship with doctor and his wife as they have become our family doctors!",

For example, my mom (Shanti Das) who was treated by him pre-operating stage used to feel great and confidence in overcoming the difficulties whenever she used to visit him at Manipal, Whitefield. That is the positive impact we have seen from Dr. Kumardev. \nHe is a very very skilled surgeon who did an excellent job in replacing knee which was badly damaged over past 10 years. \nPost surgery care were extremely good at Manipal overall and in particular Dr. Kumardev and his fellow assistants.\nOverall me and my family had an excellent experience with Manipal, Whitefield.\n\nSuchibroto Das\n",

My mother felt confident that she came to the right place and went through total knee replacement surgery for both knees and Dr. Arvind made it easy. We have heard horror stories stories from a few friends and relatives who underwent Knee replacement. However, my mother recovered totally in less than 3 months and she is at home taking care of regular home chores with no issues. Dr. Kumardev continued to be in touch with us and provided guidance for a faster recovery. I strongly recommend Dr. Kumardev anytime.",

The doctor did an ********* surgery and replaced the hip ball. \nDr Kumardev is calm, methodical, ******** *** **** *************. The calmness and methodical approach reduced a lot of anxiety we had.\n\n I would definitely recommend this doctor for your treatment. ",

He is a very keen observer, would like to give a example here. Before I went inside his cabin he had come out to talk to some one and had given a casual look and when I went inside, he while explaining told me about my seating posture which he saw outside. \n\nI personally feel we have great doctor around us.

Dr. Kumardev explained me each and every bit of fracture, what will it take to fix it and assured me of the surgery that was going to happen. He also made sure that risks are mitigated, I was operated 2 days after my injury as there was swelling which would have otherwise made the surgery riskier. Dr. Kumardev emphasizes on the things that one MUST take care and follow for good recovery. He talks in a calm manner and gives apt time during follow ups. Such an experience is hard to find with all the doctors.\nI definitely recommend Dr. Kumardev for orthopedic issues. ",

He used the hardware conservatively and allowed smaller breaks to heal naturally.The surgery was successful and the post-operative guidance for rehabilitation was commendable. I am truly impressed by the professionalism and care extended by the doctor and his team. It certainly helped me recover faster, so much so that I was able to trek again within 6 months of my injury. \n\nDuring my stay I found the other staff punctual, helpful and kind. Thanks to the doctor and Manipal team for all the care extended and keep up the good work. ",

During the entire period of surgery our doctor was taking utmost care, even he asked us to connect through watsapp also, so that I can easily show him reports and share all the information.\nI must say, it is just because of our doctor, that we got courage to go for the surgery, and it really went smooth.

After a few months, with the doctor providing a lot of positive mental support to her, my mother was even given permission to travel back to her hometown. A recent x-ray shows a full healing of the fracture, which, given her osteoporosis condition, is commendable. We thank Doctor for all his efforts, and highly recommend him.",

I was distraught and then as a timely savior seven months ago I was advised with a high to consult Dr. Kumardev Arvind Rajmanya . After my first consultation with Dr. Rajmanya I was really impressed by his attentive , caring attitude  with detailed investigative methods . He suggested thatTKR ( Total knee replacement)was the only remedy to be pain free and walk with a gait . I consented , my trust and faith in him proved right . It has given me relief from the trauma I suffered . Post surgery he personally with his team of doctors and nurses meticulously took care of all the minute details for my recovery .He is always approachable for queries and advice even today!\nToday , at 68 yrs ,5 months after the surgery,I walk and carry on my normal daily activities with a renewed vigour.\n My heartfelt gratitude to Dr Kumardev Arvind Rajmanya.",

The surgery was especially a complicated one due to the nature of the dislocation of the bone and the area where it had broken. Whoever we showed the x-ray  told us of the criticality of the fracture. It was such a traumatic experience for both my husband and myself. \n\nDr. Kumardev has been an amazing reassurance during that journey. At each step, he did not mince words about the criticality of the injury and what options we had. My brother is a Orthopedic Doctor practicing outside Karnataka. Dr. Kumardev gave us all the information and even talked with my brother explaining what the current situation is and what the next course of actions were. He reassured us of what could be done at each and every step. \n\nToday, a year later my son has completely recovered from the injury. Dr. Kumardev was able to heal his wrist using the least minimally invasive operation (which was also pretty major). He has always been accessible over phone and hospital visits even after the surgery.. In my mind, he was the right person to have handled that case and there is no one even close to his expertise that I know of. We highly recommend him for any orthopaedics concerns .",

With recommendation from our known  doctor we met Dr.Kumardev rajamanya at maniapl hospital, Whitefield. Doctor did thorough check and advised for the knee replacement as this is the only option left because her joint bones were weak, fragile, eroded & deformed. My mother in law was not ready for it but doctor convinced her by explaining the condition and building the confidence. But the surgery was challenging as her bones were fragile, Doctor explained all the possibilities which can happen during the surgery and what are the the options available in terms of materials for the replacement. Surgery went smoothly and she was in hospital for one week. fourth day after first knee replacement she started walking with aid of support and physiotherapist. After the discharge, follow ups were smooth & doctor made sure she was not waiting for long time. The best part is, I was able to contact doctor any time. If he was busy, he used to call back later. This kind of care rarely seen as doctors are busy most of the times. But, Dr.Kumardev answering all our questions politely, even some time they are repetitive. My advice is to, pls go ahead without second thought * ** ** *** *******",

After six months of  therapy, I can surely say that my leg is as good as before in the age of 77.  His instructions during the therapy are very sweet. He would not force to do the therapy at all.He was really friendly to me. I had begun to see many  changes in my leg.I have literally looked forward in meeting Dr. Kumardev during these six  months. He is very attentive, a patient listener, a thorough professional, extremely trustworthy and friendly. He has a very comforting and soothing aura which makes the patient feel at ease. He is very passionate about his job and has helped me scheduling my appointments with him. If you are reading this and are going through a difficult, overwhelming phase in your life, all I would like to say is - - SEEK HELP, ASK FOR HELP. Because Dr. Kumardev is such a doctor that I can't belive so much of satisfaction on my knee in this age. It is really unbeliveable...... Once again Thankyou Doctor Kumardev.   ",

Without adequate post-surgery care, my son ran the risk of not fully recovering the mobility of his arm.\n\nDr Kumardev's keenness in full recovery of my child was beyond our expectation. There were critical moments during the recovery period, where he provided us timely advice, which has helped my son get back full mobility in the operated arm.\n\nWe highly recommend Dr Kumardev & wish him all the best.\n\n",

It was diagnosed as galeazzi fracture both forearm. Dr. Kumardev sir had made the surgery and gave the confidence to me and to my family members where we were in panic. Now I have completed 1year without any problem with the surgery, I strongly recommend Dr. kumardev sir for any orthopedic problems, last but not least when ever I met him he treated me as a friend rather than as a doctor.             \nThank you very much sir.",

Might it be the treatment ( we were told my husband had to get a surgery done for the problem he had but Dr. Kumardev had wonderfully gotdone with a procedure instead of a surgery)  or the solution to the problem at hand, the doctor was spot on great and amazing.\nThank you much doctor for the timely help and guidance through the entire process till he\u2019s back to his normal self.",
