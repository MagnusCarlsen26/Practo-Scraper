This was a very unusual case and my sister was suffering from intense pain. Sir was very systematic and performed bone grafting, filling in the cavity with bone fragments from her pelvic bone. Later xrays made it apparent that sir had done a fantastic job and no one would believe there ever was any cyst.That's why we went to sir again, this time for our mother's knee problems. Mom had fallen on one knee and had torn her ligaments. But she always suffered from intense knee pain. Mom was stubborn and didn't want to go through surgery, but with the careful analysis sir gave her, she saw reason. We were concerned since mom is obese and has high blood pressure but we didn't need to worry because she was in the best of hands. She was admitted to Apollo Jayanagar, where sir performed total knee replacement. The left knee was operated on Jan 3, and the right on Jan 6. Now, a month later, mom is walking well without any support. She even takes short strolls in the apartment park and she can climb up and down a single flight of stairs. In the months to come, we are sure that her progress will continue to be phenomenal.Sir's meticulous work is really inspiring. I have recommended him to several friends and colleagues and we will continue to visit him for all orthopaedic cases. He cares and explains everything so that everyone understand the healing process and the factors involved in the surgery.We are truly grateful for his support and advice.If you are considering any orthopedic related procedures, please contact him *** *** **** ******* *** **** **********",

My mother is really happy and healthy post the operation and is now able to walk for 30 min without stopping and able to perform all her daily chores independently.\n\nMy mother, aged about 65 years, was almost bed ridden and was not even able to move even with walkers. Her life was miserable.\nShe was scared of the very thought of knee operation esp. when some of her friends shared stories of pain, swelling post operation and during physiotherapy.\n\nThat is when we met Dr. Deepak Inamdar in Jayanagar. He did diagnosis and explained the benefits of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. He asked us to do couple of test to determine the suitability of operation. Based on test, he recommended couple of medications and asked to do some leg exercises while sitting down as prep for surgery. My mother\u2019s all muscles were all gone and has no strength.\n\nDoctor fixed the operation after 10 days and performed TKR on both knees within gap of 3 days. Total hospital time of 10 days and post that my mother was back on her feet. He recommended physiotherapy sessions which started from day 2 itself and continued for a month, post sutures removal. Doctor started making her walk from day 2 itself and within 15 days from operation, my mother was able to walk (slowly) without any support.\n\nPain management was excellent she never felt any pain thorough out the hospital stay and post that during physiotherapy. All our myths were dispelled and my mother was really surprised that how she went thru all of this with help of Dr. Inamdar.\n\nI would also like to share that we were happy to see that doctor would always visit the patient and talk so cheerfully, encourage for the future and answer any questions/doubts we have. He even came to see the patient on the day of bangalore bandh esp. when I did not see any other doctor visiting their patients on that day. Kudos !\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr.Deepak Inamdar if someone is planning to undergo Knee Replacement. The physiotherapy plan was also well designed to suit his age and condition.\n\nThank you so much Doctor.",

It's been an end to end smooth sail process as my mom was in the right hands that's Dr.Inamdar. Certain key factors considered while consulting were:1)Clear communication about pre-tests, pre-operative measures, surgery process, post surgery pain mgmt & care, recovery process, risk factors, follow-ups, Insurance & cost mgmt.2)Doctor was accessible for any query regarding the surgery.3)One of the most important thing is that he is the single point of contact for consulting & surgery which plays a crucial role in building the trust & comfortability for the patient.The competence level in terms of technical proficiency(diagnosis/surgery), thoroughness, carefulness & the accountability of the doctor has been highly appreciated.Few other plus points has been the location, the facilities @the clinic & the ease of appointment.I would highly recommend the ortho patients to contact the doctor for treatment.",

After a month of presurgical care, surgery was completed on both knees with a day's interval.  My mother was noticed to be confident immediately after surgery and after a week, she slowly progressed to gait training with quad Walker and in a month's time progressed to walking stick.

We got to Dr.Deepak through one of my friends and visited him. Dr. Deepak is very humble and clarified all our doubts about the surgery and gave good details about it.\n\nWe went with robotic based surgery for both knees at apollo hospital. Doctor was informing us on every details about the surgery and the process, we were upto date. We took admission on Apr 26th, left leg operation was done on Apr 27th and right leg operation was done on Apr 29th. My father walked with support of walker after the surgery. Due to the utmost care by the doctor, my father had very less pain post surgery.\n\nThe best part is seeing my father walk and handle things. It's been 3 months and my dad is far better than before. He is able to walk for long on his own.\n\nAll the credit goes to Dr.Deepak. Thanks sir!",

Therefore I did go for the surgery; I was truly amazed at the pace of recovery and support I received. I also rode my bike to the Himalayas within 6months of the surgery which was truly amazing and I had zero issues post that.\nI definitely would recommend Dr. Deepak and let me tell you that you are in safe hands.

His diagnosis is accurate, he has maximum patience to explain even the minute details and post surgical care is unmatched.  I am into the 4th week of my surgery and recovering well.  He is caring, understanding and sensitive to the patient's needs and treats them to alleviate their suffering.  Thank you doctor.",

By the time the x-ray was ready he had already penned down the prescription of all the medicines, physio-therapy needs etc.  The x-ray revealed exactly as he had diagnosed the problem. My wife took physiotherapy with Dr. Aiswarya who is also available at the clinic.  Dr. Aiswarya a smart young girl could nicely explain what care needs to be taken for this problem and also taught and ensured that what is taught was practiced.\n Dr. Deepak Inamdar is highly professional, humble and talks nicely to the patient and clarifies all our doubts. He has an air of confidence and human touch which makes the patients to relax and further comforts towards getting cured.\nMy wife is relieved of the pain and the Dr. on followup has prescribed one more medicine for better joint lubricity.\n",

I had been for heel spur surgery, I lost all hope to continue play football because other doctors said you can\u2019t play or run after surgery. My cousin recommended Deepak Inamdar so he said he will do it and he did it in simple manner and it worked. It feels like miracle I can play football or run without pain now. He is like god for me now.\nHe treats us as if we are one of their family member.\nAnswers every doubts and clears it.\nOnly thing is he writes expensive medicines which is good for better treatment.

This was a very unusual case and my sister was suffering from intense pain. Sir was very systematic and performed bone grafting, filling in the cavity with bone fragments from her pelvic bone. Later xrays made it apparent that sir had done a fantastic job and no one would believe there ever was any cyst.That's why we went to sir again, this time for our mother's knee problems. Mom had fallen on one knee and had torn her ligaments. But she always suffered from intense knee pain. Mom was stubborn and didn't want to go through surgery, but with the careful analysis sir gave her, she saw reason. We were concerned since mom is obese and has high blood pressure but we didn't need to worry because she was in the best of hands. She was admitted to Apollo Jayanagar, where sir performed total knee replacement. The left knee was operated on Jan 3, and the right on Jan 6. Now, a month later, mom is walking well without any support. She even takes short strolls in the apartment park and she can climb up and down a single flight of stairs. In the months to come, we are sure that her progress will continue to be phenomenal.Sir's meticulous work is really inspiring. I have recommended him to several friends and colleagues and we will continue to visit him for all orthopaedic cases. He cares and explains everything so that everyone understand the healing process and the factors involved in the surgery.We are truly grateful for his support and advice.If you are considering any orthopedic related procedures, please contact him *** *** **** ******* *** **** **********",

My mother is really happy and healthy post the operation and is now able to walk for 30 min without stopping and able to perform all her daily chores independently.\n\nMy mother, aged about 65 years, was almost bed ridden and was not even able to move even with walkers. Her life was miserable.\nShe was scared of the very thought of knee operation esp. when some of her friends shared stories of pain, swelling post operation and during physiotherapy.\n\nThat is when we met Dr. Deepak Inamdar in Jayanagar. He did diagnosis and explained the benefits of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. He asked us to do couple of test to determine the suitability of operation. Based on test, he recommended couple of medications and asked to do some leg exercises while sitting down as prep for surgery. My mother\u2019s all muscles were all gone and has no strength.\n\nDoctor fixed the operation after 10 days and performed TKR on both knees within gap of 3 days. Total hospital time of 10 days and post that my mother was back on her feet. He recommended physiotherapy sessions which started from day 2 itself and continued for a month, post sutures removal. Doctor started making her walk from day 2 itself and within 15 days from operation, my mother was able to walk (slowly) without any support.\n\nPain management was excellent she never felt any pain thorough out the hospital stay and post that during physiotherapy. All our myths were dispelled and my mother was really surprised that how she went thru all of this with help of Dr. Inamdar.\n\nI would also like to share that we were happy to see that doctor would always visit the patient and talk so cheerfully, encourage for the future and answer any questions/doubts we have. He even came to see the patient on the day of bangalore bandh esp. when I did not see any other doctor visiting their patients on that day. Kudos !\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr.Deepak Inamdar if someone is planning to undergo Knee Replacement. The physiotherapy plan was also well designed to suit his age and condition.\n\nThank you so much Doctor.",

Certain key factors considered while consulting were:1)Clear communication about pre-tests, pre-operative measures, surgery process, post surgery pain mgmt & care, recovery process, risk factors, follow-ups, Insurance & cost mgmt.2)Doctor was accessible for any query regarding the surgery.3)One of the most important thing is that he is the single point of contact for consulting & surgery which plays a crucial role in building the trust & comfortability for the patient.The competence level in terms of technical proficiency(diagnosis/surgery), thoroughness, carefulness & the accountability of the doctor has been highly appreciated.Few other plus points has been the location, the facilities @the clinic & the ease of appointment.I would highly recommend the ortho patients to contact the doctor for treatment.",

We got to Dr.Deepak through one of my friends and visited him. Dr. Deepak is very humble and clarified all our doubts about the surgery and gave good details about it.\n\nWe went with robotic based surgery for both knees at apollo hospital. Doctor was informing us on every details about the surgery and the process, we were upto date. We took admission on Apr 26th, left leg operation was done on Apr 27th and right leg operation was done on Apr 29th. My father walked with support of walker after the surgery. Due to the utmost care by the doctor, my father had very less pain post surgery.\n\nThe best part is seeing my father walk and handle things. It's been 3 months and my dad is far better than before. He is able to walk for long on his own.\n\nAll the credit goes to Dr.Deepak. Thanks sir!",

Therefore I did go for the surgery; I was truly amazed at the pace of recovery and support I received. I also rode my bike to the Himalayas within 6months of the surgery which was truly amazing and I had zero issues post that.\nI definitely would recommend Dr. Deepak and let me tell you that you are in safe hands.

His diagnosis is accurate, he has maximum patience to explain even the minute details and post surgical care is unmatched.  I am into the 4th week of my surgery and recovering well.  He is caring, understanding and sensitive to the patient's needs and treats them to alleviate their suffering.  Thank you doctor.",

We met Dr. Deepak Inamdar and immediately he diagnosed the root cause and asked us to take an x-ray. By the time the x-ray was ready he had already penned down the prescription of all the medicines, physio-therapy needs etc.  The x-ray revealed exactly as he had diagnosed the problem. My wife took physiotherapy with Dr. Aiswarya who is also available at the clinic.  Dr. Aiswarya a smart young girl could nicely explain what care needs to be taken for this problem and also taught and ensured that what is taught was practiced.\n Dr. Deepak Inamdar is highly professional, humble and talks nicely to the patient and clarifies all our doubts. He has an air of confidence and human touch which makes the patients to relax and further comforts towards getting cured.\nMy wife is relieved of the pain and the Dr. on followup has prescribed one more medicine for better joint lubricity.\n",

From the outset the care provided by him was transparent , procedure and waiting period clearly explained. \nThe surgery was carried out at Apollo hospital. The standard of care was top notch. He diligently followed up post surgery and appropriate rehabilitation was organised by his team.\nMy dad is very happy with the outcome of the surgery and he is doing extremely well 1 year following the surgery.\nI would highly recommend him, with my professional background as a sports physician in the United Kingdom.",

I was happy to meet him in the first instance as he has time to talk to you about the problems. He explained me the causes and future course of action in the first visit. And in just 4 months on the third visit in Feb 2019 my pain is reduced by more than 75%. The pain which i had 24/7 is now reduced to some of the days only. I am relieved from the pain and happy to met him and refer him for best and speedy treatment. Visit the doc at Orthone Jayanar. He will talk with you in detail about your problems.",

Exactly after one year I had been on a bike ride in my Thunderbird to Kolli hills which is around 300km from Bangalore. This was my first ride after the surgery, the feeling was amazing. And I have also started playing badminton.\nThank you Dr Deepak \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a\nWish you Marry Christmas and Happy New year.",
