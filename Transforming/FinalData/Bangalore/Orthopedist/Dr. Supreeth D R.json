He was readily available on WhatsApp for any questions I had, which made a significant difference in managing my condition. Additionally, he provided personalized recommendations for vitamin-rich foods, ensuring that I could incorporate them into my diet easily.\n\nDr. Supreeth's expertise, combined with his patient-centric approach, has greatly improved my condition.

He took the time to listen to my concerns and provided thorough explanations, which alleviated my fears. Dr. Supreeth creates a comfortable environment where you can openly share your issues. Additionally, I enjoyed practicing Kannada with him during my visits hehe.... He is not only an exceptional orthopedic doctor but also a wonderful human being. Highly recommend!",

He was readily available on WhatsApp for any questions I had, which made a significant difference in managing my condition. Additionally, he provided personalized recommendations for vitamin-rich foods, ensuring that I could incorporate them into my diet easily.\n\nDr. Supreeth's expertise, combined with his patient-centric approach, has greatly improved my condition.

He took the time to listen to my concerns and provided thorough explanations, which alleviated my fears. Dr. Supreeth creates a comfortable environment where you can openly share your issues. Additionally, I enjoyed practicing Kannada with him during my visits hehe.... He is not only an exceptional orthopedic doctor but also a wonderful human being. Highly recommend!",

I was going a little heavy with leg excercises due to which a pain started to happen in my right knee whenever I use to go downstairs or put a little pressure.\n\nAfter going through a lot of reviews I thought of visiting Dr. Supreeth as he seemed a lot more active not only on practo but helping other patients with there questions on other platforms.\n\nHe deligently checked and examined my knee and suggested me knee excercises and Vitamin D3 with Calcium. I have been following it regularly, it has been 15 days and pain has reduced a lot.\n\nAll in all I'll from my personal experience would recommend Dr. Supreeth. Thank You once again sir for the treatment.",

He explained my problem in simple lay man language and confirmed that it is indeed sero negative arthritis. He ruled out any problem in my spine by examining and suggested me few stretching exercises and life style changes to reduce the frequency of arthritis attack. He didn't prescribe any new medicines and asked me to continue the ones which I already have for my arthritis. He spent enough time and cleared all my doubts regarding the arthritis pain. Thank you doctor.",
