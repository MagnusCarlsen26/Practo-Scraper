"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Hip Replacement,",0,0,YES,"Hi Everyone,

Greetings...

I was recommended a Total Hip Replacement Surgery in July 2019, due to some past injury commonly known as AVN (Avascular Necrosis). I had great difficulties walking, sitting, lying down & even travelling. Walking was very embarrassing, coz I had developed a limp gradually without realizing.  I had to quit my work due, in ability to travel.

After consulting several surgeons in Bangalore, I was referred to Dr Sharath in Ramaiah Hospital. He was very kind and offered to consult, though it was not his day for Consultation.

He just went through my X-ray, immediately gave me a date for admission and surgery. And said very confidently, these exact words “I’ll fix it”.

I went through the surgery in Ramaiah Hospital on the 31st of August 2019. And he kept his word, fixed me both physically & mentally. I recovered swiftly, comparatively and doing great since September 2019. I’m back to my regular life and activities, I didn’t go through any kind of post operative pain or stress or physiotherapy just followed up with the recommended out patient consultations and care.

Dr. Sharath K Ramanath in his “Profession is Perfection @ it’s BEST”.

I wish him well with his Future Accomplishments.


Regards
Rabi
