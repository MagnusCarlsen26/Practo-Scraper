I was so scared and consulted many doctors on Practo. All the doctors suggested me to go fo a surgery based on my MRI report. But Dr. JV Srinivas refused to look at my MRI scan and he performed my clinical examination and said I don\u2019t need a surgery.  However, he suggested me to do basic home remedy and revisit after 6 weeks. I am sharing this here so that someone can get benefit out of my experience. I am really grateful to my friend who recommended me to consult this doctor.",

But Dr. JV Srinivas refused to look at my MRI scan and he performed my clinical examination and said I don\u2019t need a surgery.  However, he suggested me to do basic home remedy and revisit after 6 weeks. I am sharing this here so that someone can get benefit out of my experience. I am really grateful to my friend who recommended me to consult this doctor.",
