I visited him in Columbia Asia refferel hospital, yeshwanthpur. He examined me and told me that about 60 to 70 percent of my knees are damaged so he told knee replacement surgery is the only option and the best solution for my problem. The surgery was planed after a week and I went through the surgery on 29th October 2021 by Dr.Kiran chouka and It went brilliantly well and you don't belive it I was able to walk within 24 hrs of the surgery with no pain, so I am going for my left knee replacement also which is scheduled on 2nd November 2021.I went through my second surgery ie..the left knee replacement  as scheduled on 2nd November and it also went on very well in fact it got over earlier than the previous one  it did all my knee exercises after afew hours of surgery and I walked the next morning with the support of walker.

He asked her to take some x-rays to check for the latest condition, post which he suggested knee replacement(TKR).
Dr Kiran did not ask to get the surgery done immediately. Instead he gave enough confidence to my mother about the surgery and explained the entire procedure. He also showed some of his patients videos (which included the doctors own mother's post TKR surgery). He assured her that she will be able to complete her Char-dham Religious Trip this year itself and this is when my mother felt confident that she is in safe hands. 
Finally my mother decided to go ahead with the surgery at Apollo Hospital Sheshadripuram where Dr Kiran Chouka is Head of Orthopedic Department. He made sure that everything went smoothly from the time my mother got admitted till the time of discharge. Additionally Dr. Kiran Chouka made some special arrangements to ensure that my mother felt comfortable and the surgery was 100% successful. 
Post surgery my mother was able to walk a few steps on the very next day itself and physiotherapist used to visit twice a day in the Hospital (It is normally once in other hospitals).
Dr Kiran Chouka wanted my mother to walk out of the Hospital on her own right from the beginning and miraculously, with very little support my mother was able to walk out of the hospital on her own.
Going an extra mile, he himself also arranged for a very good skilled physiotherapist to come home everyday for 3 weeks (minimum) and I am already looking forward to the day when my mother will walk without any pain.
Dr Kiran is a genius and extremely passionate towards his work. At such a young age he has excelled in the field of Orthopedics and yet is very down to earth. Dr Kiran does not have the urge to surpass others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at any cost.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"The problem that I had was unique and occurs during heavy lifting in sports. The Bicep tendon was ruptured not in the shoulder (proximal which has a 99% occurrence rate) but at the elbow (distal 1% occurrence). So I know it will be difficult to find a surgeon who has done such a surgery. However, when I met Dr Kiran Chouka, just listening to my symptoms, he was able to diagnosis what the problem was and where the tendon has ruptured. 

He explained me the complete procedure of the surgery, how complex it is, and what things he needs to take care of because of my body built and the type of bones that we Indians have in the elbow. He also said surgery is not necessary if I am are not going to perform certain activities in my day-to-day life.

What I observed are:

1. He is a very confident person.
2. He is an artist and wants to perform surgery as an artist. That means he wants the surgery to be perfect with minimal incision. 
3. Similar traditional surgeries will involve higher incision areas, whereas, for me, the incision was very minimal. Such a type of surgery will take a longer time and require a huge amount of patience.
4. The post-surgery dressing was perfect, with pain vanishing within a day.
5. After 3 visits (in 1.5 months) the doctor asked me no further visits are necessary unless I have any problem.

I am posting this experience after 2.5 years of surgery because I wanted observe the post-surgery complications. However, there are no complications. I am able to perform each and every activity that I used to perform before. And there are no visible marks on my incision point.
