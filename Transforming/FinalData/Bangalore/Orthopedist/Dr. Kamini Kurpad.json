Before meeting Dr kamini I meet few other doctors and every one said to go for surgery Immediately.  \n\nLater One of my friend suggested \"the fracture and orthopaedic clinic\" and I went there and  showed MRA report to Dr Kamini and she told its complete tear and I need to under go surgery but not immediately. Madam explained the complete procedure step by step and the time line involved in each stage. \n\nAfter one month i.e in month of April I undergone surgery at Columbia Asia yeshwanthpur and Operation was successful. Prior one day before the surgery I admitted in hospital and next time morning Dr Kamini did surgery.  Operation took approx 1 to 2 hours and by noon I am back to hospital room.\n\nI would like to say a big thanks to Dr Kamini",

It's been exactly a week now after my surgery and apart from mild pain I am confident that I will get back to my fitness lifestyle soon with full potential soon.\nThank you so much Dr. Kamini. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

We were made to wait for over 30minutes and then we were consulted by Dr Sreenivas. My mother was not at all comfortable but she had no other option. Once they confirm appointment they shud  stick to it or atleast attempt to inform the patient if there is any change in the appointment doctors' availability. We were charged a hefty fees and we were left unsatisfied.\n",

Madam explained the complete procedure step by step and the time line involved in each stage. \n\nAfter one month i.e in month of April I undergone surgery at Columbia Asia yeshwanthpur and Operation was successful. Prior one day before the surgery I admitted in hospital and next time morning Dr Kamini did surgery.  Operation took approx 1 to 2 hours and by noon I am back to hospital room.\n\nI would like to say a big thanks to Dr Kamini",

We were made to wait for over 30minutes and then we were consulted by Dr Sreenivas. My mother was not at all comfortable but she had no other option. Once they confirm appointment they shud  stick to it or atleast attempt to inform the patient if there is any change in the appointment doctors' availability.
