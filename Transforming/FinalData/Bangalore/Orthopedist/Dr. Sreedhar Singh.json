                "review_text": "I found Dr. Sreedhar Singh on Practo while looking at orthopedists for my father with severe lower back pain. Though I could not get the appointment on same day due to public holiday, I had to book it for next day evening(Doctor is available at the clinic only from 5:30pm to 7:30pm).\n\nOn the appointment day we reached 10mins prior to our booking time (5:50pm) and there were already many people waiting in the clinic. The person at the reception desk took all the details about my father and when asked if we could go in to meet the doctor at our allotted time, he said we have to wait as he would be sending inside on FCFS basis( then what\u2019s the use of booking the appointment online?) We patiently waited for an hour, where as the person at the desk sent 2-3 already known people(who had come after us) inside to meet the doctor. When asked, he said it\u2019s a follow up to show X-ray / Operation cases etc and gave some excuses. Since it was our first visit and booked online he told us to wait and it would take time to meet the doctor as the clinic wasn\u2019t open previous day. He didn\u2019t even seem to care in spite of saying my father cannot sit for too long as he has back pain. He rudely said don\u2019t keep asking again and have to wait till he says. I was so disappointed with his way of working and behaviour.\n\nFinally, it was our time to meet the doctor. He was polite and good. Doctor communicated well with us and took the details of the ailment, when & how my father has the pain. He went through previous reports for the cause of pain and checked the affected parts thoroughly. Doctor was quick in understanding the problem and advised to go for a fresh X-ray report to diagnose the issue. Later he explained very clearly without any exaggeration on what\u2019s happening and the cause for the pain with images( X-ray report displayed on his Comp Screen). Practically explained us the future course of treatment with medicines and physiotherapy(which is at the corner of the building). Medication and treatment suggested by the doctor seems to be simple and promising as my father is feeling better after two days of taking medicines & Physiotherapy. Hoping for the best. \n\nI would definitely recommended Dr. Sreedhar Singh to others with 4star ratings (-1 due to staff\u2019s disappointing behaviour and bit heavy charges for the services like consultation, X-ray and Physiotherapy.)",

On my day of appointment- I visited the clinic and felt nice to find it neat, clean and peaceful & well maintained. After 20 minutes, I went to visit the doctor. He started off by asking concerns and was quick to understand the problem. The best part was that he not only treated us with medicines but also at cognitive/mental level. He encouraged us to make lifestyle changes and involve my Mother in outdoor activity (she is a housewife from 35 years and unfortunately has faced lot of health issues). He suggested that he will start his treatment but we as a family must motivate her, boost her confidence and change her environment. We loved his idea and from very next day we started incorporating these changes. And, I must admit it has really worked! Even though her treatment has just begun, Nowadays she is much happier and we as a family have also corrected our lifestyle habits. On our second visit (he suggested us to come with some Tests/ X-rays done) - he assured my Mother of no major health issues and that she should stay more happy & peaceful and take less tension. For our family, visit to Dr Sreedhar has truly been transforming and we cannot Thank the Doctor enough. I just hope that by the end of  treatment (which will go on for few months) my Mother is fit as a fiddle.",

He shooed away my kids impolitely when one of the younger one was admiring the skeleton image printed on a vinyl sheet, saying it will break, i am sure vinyl sheets aren't made of bones Doc?  being a internally renowned doctor he should know better how to treat and inspire young children. IF children cannot accompany their parents inside he must display a board clearly mentioning the same.\r\n\r\n2. The doctor's ability to interact with the patient patiently is very poor. probably he is busy but then he does get paid for his time.\r\n\r\n3.The big unethical prescription, the doctor was informed that the patent was a hindu vegetarian, he has however prescribed a particular oral supplement which is derived from animal source and we realized this only after buying these medicines and because I can read english and the patient my mother does not, who would have swallowed the medicine as god send without knowing the source. How insensitive and unethical is this international doctor, he should be sued for negligence. \r\n\r\n4.The doctor is definitely busy and doing brisk business showing off his certificates on the wall behind him. It is unfortunate that indian doctors come back to india and behave like they have learnt nothing from the international experience. its a shame.",

He really trusts himself with his decisions and that is great. But I think that he can do a little better with communication. Its great that he trusts his judgement but he needs to be patient and listen calmly.  He is always in an extreme hurry and that does not feel satisfying. As patients we tend to have a lot of (silly) doubts and we need him to clarify everything so that we feel better mentally as well, because a major part of dealing with physical problems involves mental work. All in all he is good. I will go to him again.",

There we had to pay Mr. Singh's visiting charge and new registration and we were okay with that.\nI asked him about Onco CT Scan but he was rushing too much but he didn't explain it properly.\nAlso we told him we are getting only \"PET CT Scan\" by searching \"Onco CT Scan\", that time he said we will do PET Scan also after this.

Dr. Singh puts cast in 2-phases costing Rs9000, until below calf irrespective of me reporting calf pain and suggesting Medically approved boot for Phase-2. Also asked for Physiotherapy to strengthen the muscles for Phase-2, but nothing. On top spent Rs8000 for 2 MRI\u2019s due to wrong prescription (he wrote Ankle Joint instead of Achilles Tendon), which anyways Dr didn\u2019t check or discuss. Besides paid Rs500 for each visit, where some visits were just for waiting and 5mins chit chat. Altogether spent Rs20000 in less than 2months with Dr. Singh. \n\n23rd June, 2017, due to acute pain in the calf had to rush for Bangalore Baptist Hospital, Hebbal, where they had to cut my old cast and gave me the option of a full cast @ Rs2500 for another month or Rs9000 boot, along with Physiotherapy. \n\nOn comparing the procedures mentioned above, one can confirm upon Dr. Singh\u2019s unprofessional decision making process. Whereas one should be more compassionate and work on robust recovery plans for the patients. \n",

I didn't had an appointment any how I called the doctor and he suggested me to come over. As I went to the clinic, it was a big rush, but still the front office gave me an appointment. I waited for almost 1 hour. The doctor saw me arround, checked and prescribed me medicine. After a weeks ordial with pain I could sleep peacefully that night. I am still on medication and the pain is slowly subsidising. Thanks doctor Sreedhar Singh.\r\nPlease note take prior appointment.",

Though I could not get the appointment on same day due to public holiday, I had to book it for next day evening(Doctor is available at the clinic only from 5:30pm to 7:30pm).\n\nOn the appointment day we reached 10mins prior to our booking time (5:50pm) and there were already many people waiting in the clinic. The person at the reception desk took all the details about my father and when asked if we could go in to meet the doctor at our allotted time, he said we have to wait as he would be sending inside on FCFS basis( then what\u2019s the use of booking the appointment online?) We patiently waited for an hour, where as the person at the desk sent 2-3 already known people(who had come after us) inside to meet the doctor. When asked, he said it\u2019s a follow up to show X-ray / Operation cases etc and gave some excuses. Since it was our first visit and booked online he told us to wait and it would take time to meet the doctor as the clinic wasn\u2019t open previous day. He didn\u2019t even seem to care in spite of saying my father cannot sit for too long as he has back pain. He rudely said don\u2019t keep asking again and have to wait till he says. I was so disappointed with his way of working and behaviour.\n\nFinally, it was our time to meet the doctor. He was polite and good. Doctor communicated well with us and took the details of the ailment, when & how my father has the pain. He went through previous reports for the cause of pain and checked the affected parts thoroughly. Doctor was quick in understanding the problem and advised to go for a fresh X-ray report to diagnose the issue. Later he explained very clearly without any exaggeration on what\u2019s happening and the cause for the pain with images( X-ray report displayed on his Comp Screen). Practically explained us the future course of treatment with medicines and physiotherapy(which is at the corner of the building). Medication and treatment suggested by the doctor seems to be simple and promising as my father is feeling better after two days of taking medicines & Physiotherapy. Hoping for the best. \n\nI would definitely recommended Dr. Sreedhar Singh to others with 4star ratings (-1 due to staff\u2019s disappointing behaviour and bit heavy charges for the services like consultation, X-ray and Physiotherapy.)",

On my day of appointment- I visited the clinic and felt nice to find it neat, clean and peaceful & well maintained. After 20 minutes, I went to visit the doctor. He started off by asking concerns and was quick to understand the problem. The best part was that he not only treated us with medicines but also at cognitive/mental level. He encouraged us to make lifestyle changes and involve my Mother in outdoor activity (she is a housewife from 35 years and unfortunately has faced lot of health issues). He suggested that he will start his treatment but we as a family must motivate her, boost her confidence and change her environment. We loved his idea and from very next day we started incorporating these changes. And, I must admit it has really worked! Even though her treatment has just begun, Nowadays she is much happier and we as a family have also corrected our lifestyle habits. On our second visit (he suggested us to come with some Tests/ X-rays done) - he assured my Mother of no major health issues and that she should stay more happy & peaceful and take less tension. For our family, visit to Dr Sreedhar has truly been transforming and we cannot Thank the Doctor enough. I just hope that by the end of  treatment (which will go on for few months) my Mother is fit as a fiddle.",

He shooed away my kids impolitely when one of the younger one was admiring the skeleton image printed on a vinyl sheet, saying it will break, i am sure vinyl sheets aren't made of bones Doc?  being a internally renowned doctor he should know better how to treat and inspire young children. IF children cannot accompany their parents inside he must display a board clearly mentioning the same.\r\n\r\n2. The doctor's ability to interact with the patient patiently is very poor. probably he is busy but then he does get paid for his time.\r\n\r\n3.The big unethical prescription, the doctor was informed that the patent was a hindu vegetarian, he has however prescribed a particular oral supplement which is derived from animal source and we realized this only after buying these medicines and because I can read english and the patient my mother does not, who would have swallowed the medicine as god send without knowing the source. How insensitive and unethical is this international doctor, he should be sued for negligence. \r\n\r\n4.The doctor is definitely busy and doing brisk business showing off his certificates on the wall behind him. It is unfortunate that indian doctors come back to india and behave like they have learnt nothing from the international experience. its a shame.",

He really trusts himself with his decisions and that is great. But I think that he can do a little better with communication. Its great that he trusts his judgement but he needs to be patient and listen calmly.  He is always in an extreme hurry and that does not feel satisfying. As patients we tend to have a lot of (silly) doubts and we need him to clarify everything so that we feel better mentally as well, because a major part of dealing with physical problems involves mental work. All in all he is good. I will go to him again.",

There we had to pay Mr. Singh's visiting charge and new registration and we were okay with that.\nI asked him about Onco CT Scan but he was rushing too much but he didn't explain it properly.\nAlso we told him we are getting only \"PET CT Scan\" by searching \"Onco CT Scan\", that time he said we will do PET Scan also after this.

Dr. Singh puts cast in 2-phases costing Rs9000, until below calf irrespective of me reporting calf pain and suggesting Medically approved boot for Phase-2. Also asked for Physiotherapy to strengthen the muscles for Phase-2, but nothing. On top spent Rs8000 for 2 MRI\u2019s due to wrong prescription (he wrote Ankle Joint instead of Achilles Tendon), which anyways Dr didn\u2019t check or discuss. Besides paid Rs500 for each visit, where some visits were just for waiting and 5mins chit chat. Altogether spent Rs20000 in less than 2months with Dr. Singh. \n\n23rd June, 2017, due to acute pain in the calf had to rush for Bangalore Baptist Hospital, Hebbal, where they had to cut my old cast and gave me the option of a full cast @ Rs2500 for another month or Rs9000 boot, along with Physiotherapy. \n\nOn comparing the procedures mentioned above, one can confirm upon Dr. Singh\u2019s unprofessional decision making process. Whereas one should be more compassionate and work on robust recovery plans for the patients. \n",

I didn't had an appointment any how I called the doctor and he suggested me to come over. As I went to the clinic, it was a big rush, but still the front office gave me an appointment. I waited for almost 1 hour. The doctor saw me arround, checked and prescribed me medicine. After a weeks ordial with pain I could sleep peacefully that night. I am still on medication and the pain is slowly subsidising. Thanks doctor Sreedhar Singh.\r\nPlease note take prior appointment.",
