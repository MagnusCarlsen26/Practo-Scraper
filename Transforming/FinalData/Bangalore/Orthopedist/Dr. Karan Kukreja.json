Standing for longer than 20 minutes and activities like climbing stairs and squatting were extremely painful. After conducting a thorough examination he diagnosed her with early-stage knee osteoarthritis and recommended three weeks of physiotherapy along with muscle strengthening exercises, which significantly alleviated her pain. We liked that Dr. Karan closely monitored her progress periodically and provided constant motivation to adhere to the exercise regimen. He emphasizes the importance of exercise and a healthy lifestyle for long-term benefits instead of just prescibing medicines. His proficiency in local languages (Kannada)  did help in making the patient comfortable and no matter how many questions we really appreciate his patience and care. We  would highly recommend  him for any ortho related ailments or surgeries.",

When we went through X-ray the screw has been broken inside also the tibia bone didn\u2019t get joined properly. \n\nThen we got to know about Dr. Karan from one of our relative, who has been treated for ankle fracture from him. He was very much satisfied with his treatment. He is one of the best orthopedic doctor. \n\nWe consulted Dr. Karan. He went through the x-ray and examined my father-in-law. He clearly explained what the problem is and what kind of treatment has to be done. He went through medical records of earlier surgery. He gave enough time to clarify all our queries. He suggested for exchange nailing treatment to replace the existing rod. Within two days he operated. The operation was really successful. He properly guided us how to put slowly weight on that leg and how much rest is required. Finally my father-in-law is able to walk freely. In the recent x-ray it clearly showed good progress of bone formation in the joint. \n\nEntire treatment process was very smooth. Dr. Karan is very much approachable to clarify all queries. Post operation also we visited couple of times to his clinic \u2018Life Orthocare\u2019 for dressing and consultation. I definitely recommend Dr. Karan for any kind of orthopedic treatment.\n",

After 4 unsuccessful surgeries,I came to Dr.Karan Kukreja after an Orthopedist recommended him. He went thru my medical history and the complications of my previous surgeries. He was determined to fix my bone n make me surgery-free.  He did a detailed analysis of my bone and came up with a solution,though I was hesitant initially but got convinced by his sincerity and dedication towards his patients. My bone healed after 5 years of failed surgeries (6 in total).Its been a year of the last surgery, my hand is normal now and am able to do all the work with the hand including driving 2 wheeler. Am really grateful n thankful to Dr.Karan for saving me from more surgeries. He is the best Ortho in Bangalore,very calm,composed,knows his field ,has in-depth knowledge,explains the problem as many times as patients ask without getting irritated. Thank you so much Dr. for giving me hospital free life.",

His approach is clearly indicative of 'first do no harm'. Add to it, he is communicative, and has a re-assuring aura about him. Doctor is well learned and  very bright in my opinion. Mother's recovery was also smooth and painfree and results were good. He explains everything at every stage: consultation, pre and post surgery, and keeps your expectations practical and real by making you aware of every issue and prospective solution, and the extent achievable. \n\nIn short , he is honest and makes no false promises. Guess, that what he means by patient centric approach.\nI have  to sincerely thank him and his entire team for everything, and recommend him strongly.\n",

Unlike other doctors who only show interest in patient if the issue is complex or they can do an upcoming surgery on him/her , Dr Karan is very different. He treats everything with equal seriousness. I have seen doctors tend to neglect minor issues and feel interested only when they see a chance to do surgery . For a patient every issue even a small one is important as it is about his/her health.  Dr  Karan is definitely that doctor who will hear to your small queries and small issues and address them completely.  He gives full information and doesn't rush.  Today I could see he was very  busy yet he addressed my every issue every query. I left happy and with a light heart . Lot of respect for you doctor. \n. Thank you . You are gem .",

Standing for longer than 20 minutes and activities like climbing stairs and squatting were extremely painful. After conducting a thorough examination he diagnosed her with early-stage knee osteoarthritis and recommended three weeks of physiotherapy along with muscle strengthening exercises, which significantly alleviated her pain. We liked that Dr. Karan closely monitored her progress periodically and provided constant motivation to adhere to the exercise regimen. He emphasizes the importance of exercise and a healthy lifestyle for long-term benefits instead of just prescibing medicines. His proficiency in local languages (Kannada)  did help in making the patient comfortable and no matter how many questions we really appreciate his patience and care. We  would highly recommend  him for any ortho related ailments or surgeries.",

He got treated in Sparsh hospital by another doctor. There he got closed reduction internal fixation done in both the bones. Started recovering and was able to walk after 3 months. \n\nSoon after 1 year he started pain in left leg tibia bone. When we went through X-ray the screw has been broken inside also the tibia bone didn\u2019t get joined properly. \n\nThen we got to know about Dr. Karan from one of our relative, who has been treated for ankle fracture from him. He was very much satisfied with his treatment. He is one of the best orthopedic doctor. \n\nWe consulted Dr. Karan. He went through the x-ray and examined my father-in-law. He clearly explained what the problem is and what kind of treatment has to be done. He went through medical records of earlier surgery. He gave enough time to clarify all our queries. He suggested for exchange nailing treatment to replace the existing rod. Within two days he operated. The operation was really successful. He properly guided us how to put slowly weight on that leg and how much rest is required. Finally my father-in-law is able to walk freely. In the recent x-ray it clearly showed good progress of bone formation in the joint. \n\nEntire treatment process was very smooth. Dr. Karan is very much approachable to clarify all queries. Post operation also we visited couple of times to his clinic \u2018Life Orthocare\u2019 for dressing and consultation. I definitely recommend Dr. Karan for any kind of orthopedic treatment.\n",

My bone healed after 5 years of failed surgeries (6 in total).Its been a year of the last surgery, my hand is normal now and am able to do all the work with the hand including driving 2 wheeler. Am really grateful n thankful to Dr.Karan for saving me from more surgeries. He is the best Ortho in Bangalore,very calm,composed,knows his field ,has in-depth knowledge,explains the problem as many times as patients ask without getting irritated. Thank you so much Dr. for giving me hospital free life.",

His approach is clearly indicative of 'first do no harm'. Add to it, he is communicative, and has a re-assuring aura about him. Doctor is well learned and  very bright in my opinion. Mother's recovery was also smooth and painfree and results were good. He explains everything at every stage: consultation, pre and post surgery, and keeps your expectations practical and real by making you aware of every issue and prospective solution, and the extent achievable. \n\nIn short , he is honest and makes no false promises. Guess, that what he means by patient centric approach.\nI have  to sincerely thank him and his entire team for everything, and recommend him strongly.\n",

Unlike other doctors who only show interest in patient if the issue is complex or they can do an upcoming surgery on him/her , Dr Karan is very different. He treats everything with equal seriousness. I have seen doctors tend to neglect minor issues and feel interested only when they see a chance to do surgery . For a patient every issue even a small one is important as it is about his/her health.  Dr  Karan is definitely that doctor who will hear to your small queries and small issues and address them completely.  He gives full information and doesn't rush.  Today I could see he was very  busy yet he addressed my every issue every query. I left happy and with a light heart . Lot of respect for you doctor. \n. Thank you . You are gem .",

He said I should wait for a few weeks to see if these simple remedies work otherwise we might have to go ahead with some other measures.\n\nThe only problem I had was with the mismanagement of wait time. People were randomly standing around waiting to enter the consultation room. There was a nurse but we had to ask her to call us as people who came to the clinic after us were trying to get their check-up done before us. It would be great if they could just have a simple token system to call out patients according to their wait times.",
