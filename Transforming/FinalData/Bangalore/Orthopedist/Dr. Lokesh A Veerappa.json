I agree that the dressing done by my junior doctor was flimsy because the patient insisted on it not being tight.     However,the second time dressing was done well.  Doing plastic surgery on a 1cm wide wound, which would automatically heal given sometime is not what I recommend.

Calling the doctor is an inappropriate action as he will be occupied in patient care, surgeries etc. I do not encourage phone calls as it is not recommended by the Medical Council of India and any mistaken information passed on makes doctor liable. This is what I tell  all patients, that they can WhatsApp me and I'll get back to them later. I've never been discourteous to my patients however they behave.If you find my action inappropriate suit yourself.",

I vaguely remember (under anesthesia ), he was taking my name after surgery saying that, 'Ajay it's done successfully'.\nI will definitely recommend Dr Lokesh.\n",

I agree that the dressing done by my junior doctor was flimsy because the patient insisted on it not being tight.     However,the second time dressing was done well.  Doing plastic surgery on a 1cm wide wound, which would automatically heal given sometime is not what I recommend.
