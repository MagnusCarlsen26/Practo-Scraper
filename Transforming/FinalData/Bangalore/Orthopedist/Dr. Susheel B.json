I went to him with a boxer\u2019s fracture on my right hand to seek a second opinion. Not only did he explain the injury and treatment in a detailed yet simple manner, he and his team also helped us with finding the most affordable way to get the procedure done. His team co ordinated with us throughout the surgery process, provides us guidance with insurance and most of the paperwork. I had two surgeries - a k wire implant and its subsequent removal 5 weeks later. And both of them went as smooth as it possibly could have been. His recommendation on diet and supplement medicines were well informed and I had a full recovery in less than two months. He always motivated and kept my spirits up during the scheduled consults. I would recommend him 10/10 for any orthopaedic issue you may be facing. Bless you, Doctor!",

Dr Susheel simply dismissed to see the films saying you have got it done from a low cost MRI and their films won't be good. \n\nI was surprised with this behaviour. How can a doctor comment about quality of films without even looking at it? Or was he perhaps upset that I didn't get MRI done from the centre he asked me to go to * *** ******* ******** Then he dismissed me saying come tomorrow with reports. I felt humiliated having spent time and money to get what the doctor asked me to and he just dismissed it! \n\nI eventually went to a reputed hospital and a reputed Ortho there * *** ******* *** *** ***** *** ******* *** ********** * ** ******* ****** **** * ***** **** ***** ***** ***** ******* ** *** *** ***** *** ** **** **** **** * **** ****** ** ******** *** ******** \n\nDo doctors like Susheel even understand the trouble a patient goes through in terms of time and money spent for the test? How can you just dismiss a patient just because he did not get MRI done at your preferred diagnostic centre?

I went to him with a boxer\u2019s fracture on my right hand to seek a second opinion. Not only did he explain the injury and treatment in a detailed yet simple manner, he and his team also helped us with finding the most affordable way to get the procedure done. His team co ordinated with us throughout the surgery process, provides us guidance with insurance and most of the paperwork. I had two surgeries - a k wire implant and its subsequent removal 5 weeks later. And both of them went as smooth as it possibly could have been. His recommendation on diet and supplement medicines were well informed and I had a full recovery in less than two months. He always motivated and kept my spirits up during the scheduled consults. I would recommend him 10/10 for any orthopaedic issue you may be facing. Bless you, Doctor!",

Dr Susheel simply dismissed to see the films saying you have got it done from a low cost MRI and their films won't be good. \n\nI was surprised with this behaviour. How can a doctor comment about quality of films without even looking at it? Or was he perhaps upset that I didn't get MRI done from the centre he asked me to go to * *** ******* ******** Then he dismissed me saying come tomorrow with reports.

You asked for certificate for bed rest, which I denied as you are not taking any active medical treatment. I clearly told, I can\u2019t as I believe it won\u2019t heal with staying at home. Asked you to do MRI if you are in doubt, which was also not acceptable for you. \nIf you would have told in reception that you are looking for a medical certificate, they would have not entertained you at all. By doing that you would have allowed patients who we\u2019re waiting to get treated some more earlier space. Kindly take out from your mind that you have paid, so you are entitled to your views. It\u2019s treating doctors decision to do best for his patients. Instead of wasting time expressing your frustration here, which is of minuscule significance , go ahead & get yourself treated before it becomes too late. All the best for your ankle.",
