"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"
I am feeling profound honoured and proud to write about very senior and highly learned Dr.RaviKumar Mukartihal who is not only wonderful and excellent  Orthopedic and Robotic surgeon but also a great human being which I experienced in my first ever examination of both knee problems. He explained everything to me in a very clear manner. He was also very kind and friendly. Due to his great expertise and experience in Robotic knee surgery and looking to his mighty confidence in me I got ready for bilateral Total knee replacement on 23rdJuly 2022. During my hospital stay he was so cooperative and helping nature attitude. Resultantly I am able to recover so fast even within 12days of surgery I am able to walk without any Walker/stick or any support.At the time of stitch removal On 14thday I entered into hospital on foot even without any support. All hospital staff surprised to see my fast recovery. All credit goes to Dr Ravi who always inspired me with smiling face during stay in hospital and showed great confidence in me that I would recover very fast.Even after discharge from hospital he is kind enough to reply my each and every WhatsApp messages so quickly with building up a great satisfaction of my all querry.
Dr. Ravi is incredible. Not only has he taken great care of my health, but also he is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It‚Äôs rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. Hence I came all the way from Jaipur Rajasthan to Bengalore for TKR at very reasonable cost .I highly recommend becoming his patient!

Great medical office, wonderful and warm experience from start to finish. Appreciate Dr.Ravi taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options.

Wonderful experience with Sparsh hospital Bengalore where Dr. Ravi is a wonderful surgeon, and the staff was always helpful and kind. They ensured I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up. I am so glad and lucky that I chosen Dr Ravi for TKR and would highly recommend to anyone. I started to walk daily on an average 4 to 5km with out any problem within two months of TKR. Once you meet personally you started to love him as a great Doctor at the same time wonderful cooperative human being.
I highly recommend Dr RaviKumar Murkatihal, Bengalore for TKR and even for any ortho problem also.
