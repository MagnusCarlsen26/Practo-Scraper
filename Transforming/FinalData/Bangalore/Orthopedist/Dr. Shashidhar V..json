Then I approached Practo surgeries and they suggested me to meet Sir, which I did and that has been a big turning point for me. He was so patient during consultation and asked me to explain the whole incident and also even checked about my past medical history, post listening to the same he explained about my condition in a lay man's language which helped me understanding the same better. Then he suggested me to undergo further 2 weeks of rest as it was my first episode of dislocation, which really helped and it saved me from an surgery. He suggested me to undergo 3 weeks of physiotherapy to regain the strength and movement of the hand, which I am currently doing. Out of my personal experience I had a great experience with Sir and can't thank him enough of for the support and guidance. I would without any doubt would suggest him to all my family and friends. God bless him for his kindness and caring mentality.",

He gives a lot of time to his patients and takes effort to explain the possibilities and outcome of each of the procedure. He makes sure that the patient and the family are happy and connects with them on a regular basis. I was not next to my mother when she underwent the surgery, but I did not have to worry because I knew my mother was taken care by the doctor and was in the best hands!  \n\nI wish all the doctors work like him and give enough time and concern to each and every patient. I am not making any offensive statement here, but I have seen most of the doctors are here to make only MONEY! but Dr Shashidhar is definitely not one of those. He makes sure that the decision that is taken is only for the benefit of the patient without any personal motive. \nI can't thank him enough for all the good he has done to our family. We all owe him lot of respect and love!",

This helped keep up my spirits and stay calm during the surgery. \n\nI was given crystal clear instructions on do's and don'ts post surgery and also on physiotherapy. \n\nDoctor was personally following up with me on my progress and was answering all the questions I had. \n\nOverall, the surgery was successful and my leg is strong and stable today and I profusely thank Dr. Shashidhar for the same. \n\nPost my surgery, I have referred some friends when they had orthopaedic issues and all of them have come back with the same opinion. \n\nMy relatives have also undergone knee replacement surgeries through Dr. Shashidhar and are doing great today. \n\nCalm, professional, friendly and approachable - these are what define him!

I had visited 4 orthopedicians and neurologists and I was always misguided that it was my cervical issue but he was the one to find out that I had rheumatoid arthritis and it had already affected my shoulder joint. Even the knee and hip joint were associated but with his treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, my knee and hip joint recovered. For shoulder joint he performed a successful arthoscopy, without which I would have lost my left hand mobility completely. The level of patience and time he gives for case study is commendable. His friendliness and smile makes the patient feel that there is nothing major and boosts the self confidence. I thank him from the bottom of my heart.\n ",

Then I approached Practo surgeries and they suggested me to meet Sir, which I did and that has been a big turning point for me. He was so patient during consultation and asked me to explain the whole incident and also even checked about my past medical history, post listening to the same he explained about my condition in a lay man's language which helped me understanding the same better. Then he suggested me to undergo further 2 weeks of rest as it was my first episode of dislocation, which really helped and it saved me from an surgery. He suggested me to undergo 3 weeks of physiotherapy to regain the strength and movement of the hand, which I am currently doing. Out of my personal experience I had a great experience with Sir and can't thank him enough of for the support and guidance. I would without any doubt would suggest him to all my family and friends. God bless him for his kindness and caring mentality.",

He gives a lot of time to his patients and takes effort to explain the possibilities and outcome of each of the procedure. He makes sure that the patient and the family are happy and connects with them on a regular basis. I was not next to my mother when she underwent the surgery, but I did not have to worry because I knew my mother was taken care by the doctor and was in the best hands!  \n\nI wish all the doctors work like him and give enough time and concern to each and every patient. I am not making any offensive statement here, but I have seen most of the doctors are here to make only MONEY! but Dr Shashidhar is definitely not one of those. He makes sure that the decision that is taken is only for the benefit of the patient without any personal motive. \nI can't thank him enough for all the good he has done to our family. We all owe him lot of respect and love!",

I had visited 4 orthopedicians and neurologists and I was always misguided that it was my cervical issue but he was the one to find out that I had rheumatoid arthritis and it had already affected my shoulder joint. Even the knee and hip joint were associated but with his treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, my knee and hip joint recovered. For shoulder joint he performed a successful arthoscopy, without which I would have lost my left hand mobility completely. The level of patience and time he gives for case study is commendable. His friendliness and smile makes the patient feel that there is nothing major and boosts the self confidence. I thank him from the bottom of my heart.\n ",

He replaced both my father's knees during last year. He professionally handled the surgeries to our complete satisfaction. His handling of post surgery really gave confidence to our family. Now, my father walks like 50 year old though his actual age is 86 years.\n His down to earth attitude helped us in getting the lab tests done and results known very early.\n\nPost this surgery, I recommended him for many within our family and they are also completely satisfied with his professional treatment.\n\nA big thanks to you Shashidhar for your help in knee replacement for my father.  You deserve a very big applause for your professional handling of the situation. \n\nI very strongly recommend Dr. Shashidhar for any consultation and surgery.",

After the diagonosis, he prescribed physiotherapy and some drugs. \n\nAfter 3 sittings if physiotherapy, back pain vanished. \n\nI was thinking that this is going to be a big problem with more sufferings and frequent visits to hospital. Right after the diagonosis and prescriptions, most importantly after speaking to the doctor, my inhibitions got answered.  I really thank  doctor for this.\n\nOverall, Dr Shashidhar is a great person to talk to and get the medical clarifications (He spends time speaking and answering all doubts) and makes it easy to go through the treatment.\n\nThanks again Doctor.\nVaidyo Narayano Harihi!!",
