Ten years ago, he operated on my sister for a benign cyst in her left heel. This was a very unusual case and my sister was suffering from intense pain.

Later xrays made it apparent that sir had done a fantastic job and no one would believe there ever was any cyst.That's why we went to sir again, this time for our mother's knee problems. Mom had fallen on one knee and had torn her ligaments. But she always suffered from intense knee pain. Mom was stubborn and didn't want to go through surgery, but with the careful analysis sir gave her, she saw reason. We were concerned since mom is obese and has high blood pressure but we didn't need to worry because she was in the best of hands. She was admitted to Apollo Jayanagar, where sir performed total knee replacement. The left knee was operated on Jan 3, and the right on Jan 6. Now, a month later, mom is walking well without any support. She even takes short strolls in the apartment park and she can climb up and down a single flight of stairs. In the months to come, we are sure that her progress will continue to be phenomenal.Sir's meticulous work is really inspiring.
