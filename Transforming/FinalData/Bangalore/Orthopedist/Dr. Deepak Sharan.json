In his haste, doesn't even respond to patient's questions properly * ********** **** ** **** **** ****** ** ***** ***** ***** ********** For my ankle pain, he asked for x-ray, bone density test (3000+) and full blood test (again 3000+) from his own clinic. Physiotherapy again from his own clinic of which I took 14 to 21 sessions without any improvement. Also took vitamin D, calcium etc. for 3 months and other tablets as per his advice without an iota of improvement. Ended up spending more than 10k over his treatment and many long hours of wait. Once on asking about the technique of one of his physiotherapists, was very rudely snubbed saying, \"He is the expert not you, don't question\". Please stay away from him & all Recoup clinics for your own well being.",
