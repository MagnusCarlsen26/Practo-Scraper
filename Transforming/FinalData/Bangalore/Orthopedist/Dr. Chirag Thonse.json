                "review_text": "Dr. Chirag Thonse, an absolute magician! True magic in his hands and I can say it by my firsthand experience. My ACL reconstruction was due for almost 3 years and what I did during this time was researched and tried all possible means to have my ligament back to avoid an operation. Now with the numerous videos on YouTube about ACL repair/reconstruction of which few are motivating by a step and few demotivating back by several steps, to sum up on the outcome of the research that I did, I was confused and afraid of a surgery and hence the reason to the delay. Well I must admit that I have consulted many Doctors and have no count of the number of MRI\u2019s that I have taken in an expectation to see if my ligament has improved by time. Dr. Chirag Thonse was one such doctor whom I met and with the discussion on the approach and the confidence he gave me I was convinced, at that point I felt I need to get the reconstruction procedure done right away then and there. It was in March 2020 that I consulted Dr. Chirag and in April 2020 I underwent the surgery, mind you it was the lockdown and yes he operated my ACL with the pandemic around. On the experiences from the blogs and videos that I had I was certain of the post operation pain and was nervous beyond normal. The day of operation, it was no less than thriller with my heart pounding hard and all the prep-up going on for the procedure. Finally I was at the operation theatre witnessing the entire procedure on the TV/monitor while Dr. Chirag and team were in action. After the operation I was under care for almost 2 hours and later shifted to my ward. All that I was awaiting and prepared for was the post-op pain, the night of the operation I experienced it but not to the extent that I had read and watched. I thought probably it is the anesthesia and the pain management doses keeping me away from pain. The next day morning I was made to walk, yes you heard it was the very next day and it was indeed surprising that I was doing absolutely fine and walked quite a distance with the Physio\u2019s support (never expected this at all). Only disappointment was that there was no pain at all that day, all my expectation was in vain :). I got discharged on the second day. After a week I called up Dr. Chirag and expressed the expectation that I had and I asked Doctor, how can there be no paint at all? He smiled and said, that\u2019s why people get their ACL surgery done with me. I must also stress on the fact that Dr. Chirag leaves no stone unturned in terms of taking care of his patients, I have been in touch with him for 8 months now, I am able to jog, jump and squat. I am really blessed and fortunate to have the ACL surgery done by him. He guides you at every step on the journey to progress and the upcoming milestones, to top it all his patience is that of a Saint for the number of patients he has and he operates on a day to day basis. **** *** **** **** **** ** *** ** ** ************* *** *** ****** * **** *** * ********* Thank you Doctor for what you have done, I will remain thankful to you forever\n",

He patiently  listened & allowed me to speak to give him all the details like how the injury happened, which part of my knee I had more pain etc. After analyzing my injury, with the help of knee model, he explained me in detail about my injury & what was the impacted of injury. After looking at the MRI scan, he did not rush & asked me undergo surgery immediately, but took 10 days\u2019 time to analysis further with medication & some exercise. \n\nI had to undergo ACL & Meniscus balancing surgery. For Dr. Chirag his patients are more important to him, he takes care of them very well and treats them with utmost care. Either its pre or post-surgery, he make a point that his patients understand everything about the injury, surgery & medication by explaining even the smallest of the things that we need to know. He explained the procedures clearly & post operation what are step of recovery process and how long it will take by giving the timeline including the Physiotherapy process. He put me across to the best physiotherapists, he takes extra care of his patient by giving & getting the right treatment done his patients.\n\nDr. Chirag has a wonderful team, they made me to feel so comfortable & helpful during my stay in hospital. I would like to Thank all the team members of Doctor & special call out to Mrs. Yasmin for all her support, right from day one.\n\nThank a lot Dr. Chirag for everything you have done and wish you lots of success in you future",

It was almost 2 months I was on crutches and I didn't notice improvement and came to India where my uncle referred Dr. Chirag. He analyzed the case and suggested me to go for an Arthroscopy MPFL Reconstruction and physiotherapy pre and post surgery. I wasn't prepared for the surgery. He gave enough confidence to go for it. He even helped in the insurance process. \n\nI had surgery 7 months ago. I followed all his instructions. Whenever I had clarification, I used to ask him over Whatsapp.   I'm happy with post-surgery results. I'm thankful **** * ***** * **** doctor. \n\nHe is professional, friendly, approachable, and goes the extra mile.

Alright, we continued for a month, then again visited. The meeting, response and everything remained same very cold, I mean there was no personal touch at all, as if we are meeting for the first time, no patient history no track, simply a visit. I was a little frustrated by this time as my mother was not getting better. As it was about 2 months now, I asked doctor any idea how much time it is going to take, shall we change physiotherapy, or basically is there a plan. The answer was again very cold that \u201cit\u2019s going to take one year and I\u2019m not a physiotherapist so cannot tell what needs to be changed\u201d.

Chirag Thonse had no patience to listen with empathy, nor explain the medication properly. He rushed through the entire consultation & walked off abruptly after giving a medical opinion. My mother tried showing him the old prescriptions & medical files of consultations with specialist hospital, but he just shut the file & said, there's no need to see it. We were offended by his rude behaviour & impatient nature. On Asking him to repeat the medication prescribed, he stared at my mother & directed her to go out & speak to the assistant to explain. We had a a bad experience with him & were uncomfortable with his behaviour. The second time we visited him in the hennur clinic & faced a similar rushed consultation with him. We will never return again to consult with him, as we prefer to pay & see a doctor that has patience, ******** ** ****** * **** *** ***** *** *** ** *** * ********* I don't recommend chirag Thonse to anyone.

So I went to Dr Chirag Recomened by my physio... He explained me the whole problem... And Recomened a surjery to be done.  The costing of the surjery was very reasonable. When I arranged my finances... I was admitted in Vikram hospital and there the surgery went very smooth... Even there was a madam... She helped me the best possible way, starting from before surgery meeting the doctor to getting admitted in the hospital, and following up every now and then. Keeping me updated. She was very kind and helpful. I was able to see what was going on for the whole time..in the operation theatre\n\n Every time I had any doubt Chirag sir and madam  would address it with care. Even post surgery also the medicines which he suggested helped me to recover faster. Overall a great experience. Now it has been around 5 months.. And I can swim and cycle.. And started jogging also. Overall a amazing experience. And yes a great great team ortho clinic. Wish you all the best. ",

She was petrified of Doctors and refused to visit one. A friend recommended Dr Chirag and there was no looking back.  On her very first visit to the Doctor, he patiently listened to all her complaints and answered all her questions. She was convinced that she was in safe hands and agreed to go ahead with the surgery. He convinced her that she will be able to walk normally again.\n\nMost importantly the surgery was a success and her recovery was uneventful. She was made to walk the next day of the surgery.  This was incredible.\n\nEveryone whom we came into contact with both at the Clinic and the hospital - the Radiologist, the anesthesiologist, the nurses, the physiotherapists,, the Doctor's personal assistants all went out of their way to make the patient comfortable during her 4 day stay in the hospital.\n\nDr Chirag is a friendly, patient, compassionate, dedicated Doctor whose only aim is to put his patients back on their feet. Doctor is personally involved in the post operative recovery of his patients and never fails to answer or return a call.\n\nA great Doctor and a blessed human being!!  \n",

All i had to share were my policy details and his people took care of the rest.\nEven post surgery he has been very helpful in clearing any doubts. He encourages you to keep him updated.\nHis confidence rubbed off on me and I was able to take walks as long as 90 mins within the first week of surgery.\nI met with other doctors but no one took the time to explain the procedure and time of recovery to go back into specific activities.\nAlso the fact that I didn\u2019t have to go through insurance agents was a huge plus. All I did was show up to the hospital.",

I consulted Dr in 2016 for a torn right knee ACL from a motorcycle crash 4 years ago, surgery was performed as a last resort option considering my willingness to return to full body contact sports at active level. Dr Chirag coordinated prehab, surgery and post operative rehab / physiotherapy with utmost care considering my active sporting lifestyle. It was critical that I follow the routine diligently and glad I did... A year after surgery I was back to playing amateur football and competitive cycling without any pain or buckling of knee. Dr added to the physiotherapy routine more strengthening and power workouts during subsequent follow up visits and I since lost 10+ KGs mostly in body fat. Thanks to Dr Chirag and his efficient team of physiotherapists, I have now surpassed my pre surgery fitness levels and find myself racing for LBB Racing Team in  elite category. Thanks much Sir.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Chirag Thonse, an absolute magician! True magic in his hands and I can say it by my firsthand experience. My ACL reconstruction was due for almost 3 years and what I did during this time was researched and tried all possible means to have my ligament back to avoid an operation. Now with the numerous videos on YouTube about ACL repair/reconstruction of which few are motivating by a step and few demotivating back by several steps, to sum up on the outcome of the research that I did, I was confused and afraid of a surgery and hence the reason to the delay. Well I must admit that I have consulted many Doctors and have no count of the number of MRI\u2019s that I have taken in an expectation to see if my ligament has improved by time. Dr. Chirag Thonse was one such doctor whom I met and with the discussion on the approach and the confidence he gave me I was convinced, at that point I felt I need to get the reconstruction procedure done right away then and there. It was in March 2020 that I consulted Dr. Chirag and in April 2020 I underwent the surgery, mind you it was the lockdown and yes he operated my ACL with the pandemic around. On the experiences from the blogs and videos that I had I was certain of the post operation pain and was nervous beyond normal. The day of operation, it was no less than thriller with my heart pounding hard and all the prep-up going on for the procedure. Finally I was at the operation theatre witnessing the entire procedure on the TV/monitor while Dr. Chirag and team were in action. After the operation I was under care for almost 2 hours and later shifted to my ward. All that I was awaiting and prepared for was the post-op pain, the night of the operation I experienced it but not to the extent that I had read and watched. I thought probably it is the anesthesia and the pain management doses keeping me away from pain. The next day morning I was made to walk, yes you heard it was the very next day and it was indeed surprising that I was doing absolutely fine and walked quite a distance with the Physio\u2019s support (never expected this at all). Only disappointment was that there was no pain at all that day, all my expectation was in vain :). I got discharged on the second day. After a week I called up Dr. Chirag and expressed the expectation that I had and I asked Doctor, how can there be no paint at all? He smiled and said, that\u2019s why people get their ACL surgery done with me. I must also stress on the fact that Dr. Chirag leaves no stone unturned in terms of taking care of his patients, I have been in touch with him for 8 months now, I am able to jog, jump and squat. I am really blessed and fortunate to have the ACL surgery done by him. He guides you at every step on the journey to progress and the upcoming milestones, to top it all his patience is that of a Saint for the number of patients he has and he operates on a day to day basis. **** *** **** **** **** ** *** ** ** ************* *** *** ****** * **** *** * ********* Thank you Doctor for what you have done, I will remain thankful to you forever\n",

He patiently  listened & allowed me to speak to give him all the details like how the injury happened, which part of my knee I had more pain etc. After analyzing my injury, with the help of knee model, he explained me in detail about my injury & what was the impacted of injury. After looking at the MRI scan, he did not rush & asked me undergo surgery immediately, but took 10 days\u2019 time to analysis further with medication & some exercise. \n\nI had to undergo ACL & Meniscus balancing surgery. For Dr. Chirag his patients are more important to him, he takes care of them very well and treats them with utmost care. Either its pre or post-surgery, he make a point that his patients understand everything about the injury, surgery & medication by explaining even the smallest of the things that we need to know. He explained the procedures clearly & post operation what are step of recovery process and how long it will take by giving the timeline including the Physiotherapy process. He put me across to the best physiotherapists, he takes extra care of his patient by giving & getting the right treatment done his patients.\n\nDr. Chirag has a wonderful team, they made me to feel so comfortable & helpful during my stay in hospital. I would like to Thank all the team members of Doctor & special call out to Mrs. Yasmin for all her support, right from day one.\n\nThank a lot Dr. Chirag for everything you have done and wish you lots of success in you future",

It was almost 2 months I was on crutches and I didn't notice improvement and came to India where my uncle referred Dr. Chirag. He analyzed the case and suggested me to go for an Arthroscopy MPFL Reconstruction and physiotherapy pre and post surgery. I wasn't prepared for the surgery. He gave enough confidence to go for it. He even helped in the insurance process. \n\nI had surgery 7 months ago. I followed all his instructions. Whenever I had clarification, I used to ask him over Whatsapp.   I'm happy with post-surgery results. I'm thankful **** * ***** * **** doctor. \n\nHe is professional, friendly, approachable, and goes the extra mile.

When I insisted and asked that shall we come and meet you, he very casually said \u201cyes, you may come\u201d. Second meeting as well was cold and he simply said to continue physiotherapy. Alright, we continued for a month, then again visited. The meeting, response and everything remained same very cold, I mean there was no personal touch at all, as if we are meeting for the first time, no patient history no track, simply a visit. I was a little frustrated by this time as my mother was not getting better. As it was about 2 months now, I asked doctor any idea how much time it is going to take, shall we change physiotherapy, or basically is there a plan. The answer was again very cold that \u201cit\u2019s going to take one year and I\u2019m not a physiotherapist so cannot tell what needs to be changed\u201d.

Was made to wait for more than 2 hours & on finely meeting him. *** ** **** **** ******** **** **** My mother is aged 70 years & takes time to process information. Chirag Thonse had no patience to listen with empathy, nor explain the medication properly. He rushed through the entire consultation & walked off abruptly after giving a medical opinion. My mother tried showing him the old prescriptions & medical files of consultations with specialist hospital, but he just shut the file & said, there's no need to see it. We were offended by his rude behaviour & impatient nature. On Asking him to repeat the medication prescribed, he stared at my mother & directed her to go out & speak to the assistant to explain. We had a a bad experience with him & were uncomfortable with his behaviour. The second time we visited him in the hennur clinic & faced a similar rushed consultation with him. We will never return again to consult with him, as we prefer to pay & see a doctor that has patience, ******** ** ****** * **** *** ***** *** *** ** *** * ********* I don't recommend chirag Thonse to anyone.

So I went to Dr Chirag Recomened by my physio... He explained me the whole problem... And Recomened a surjery to be done.  The costing of the surjery was very reasonable. When I arranged my finances... I was admitted in Vikram hospital and there the surgery went very smooth... Even there was a madam... She helped me the best possible way, starting from before surgery meeting the doctor to getting admitted in the hospital, and following up every now and then. Keeping me updated. She was very kind and helpful. I was able to see what was going on for the whole time..in the operation theatre\n\n Every time I had any doubt Chirag sir and madam  would address it with care. Even post surgery also the medicines which he suggested helped me to recover faster. Overall a great experience. Now it has been around 5 months.. And I can swim and cycle.. And started jogging also. Overall a amazing experience. And yes a great great team ortho clinic. Wish you all the best. ",

She was petrified of Doctors and refused to visit one. A friend recommended Dr Chirag and there was no looking back.  On her very first visit to the Doctor, he patiently listened to all her complaints and answered all her questions. She was convinced that she was in safe hands and agreed to go ahead with the surgery. He convinced her that she will be able to walk normally again.\n\nMost importantly the surgery was a success and her recovery was uneventful. She was made to walk the next day of the surgery.  This was incredible.\n\nEveryone whom we came into contact with both at the Clinic and the hospital - the Radiologist, the anesthesiologist, the nurses, the physiotherapists,, the Doctor's personal assistants all went out of their way to make the patient comfortable during her 4 day stay in the hospital.\n\nDr Chirag is a friendly, patient, compassionate, dedicated Doctor whose only aim is to put his patients back on their feet. Doctor is personally involved in the post operative recovery of his patients and never fails to answer or return a call.\n\nA great Doctor and a blessed human being!!  \n",

All i had to share were my policy details and his people took care of the rest.\nEven post surgery he has been very helpful in clearing any doubts. He encourages you to keep him updated.\nHis confidence rubbed off on me and I was able to take walks as long as 90 mins within the first week of surgery.\nI met with other doctors but no one took the time to explain the procedure and time of recovery to go back into specific activities.\nAlso the fact that I didn\u2019t have to go through insurance agents was a huge plus. All I did was show up to the hospital.",

I consulted Dr in 2016 for a torn right knee ACL from a motorcycle crash 4 years ago, surgery was performed as a last resort option considering my willingness to return to full body contact sports at active level. Dr Chirag coordinated prehab, surgery and post operative rehab / physiotherapy with utmost care considering my active sporting lifestyle. It was critical that I follow the routine diligently and glad I did... A year after surgery I was back to playing amateur football and competitive cycling without any pain or buckling of knee. Dr added to the physiotherapy routine more strengthening and power workouts during subsequent follow up visits and I since lost 10+ KGs mostly in body fat. Thanks to Dr Chirag and his efficient team of physiotherapists, I have now surpassed my pre surgery fitness levels and find myself racing for LBB Racing Team in  elite category. Thanks much Sir.",

We choose this doctor because of a lot of positive reviews.\nMy mother's right knee was displaced and her leg wasn't straight she used to hobble but she did not experience any pain.\nThe doctor suggested knee replacement surgery and we went ahead with it as he assured us that\nthis is a common operation and within a couple of weeks, my mother could walk normally.\nHe didn't caution us at all about any potential failures *** ******* ******* ***** *** **** *********** ****** *** *** **** *** ****** Even after 4 months my mother's leg still isn't straight \nand she still hobbles. The bad part is that she experiences slight pain when she walks but at night the pain \nbecomes so unbearable that she has to take a pain killer.\n\nThe doctor tried to place plaster twice (one week each) post surgery but the moment the plasters are removed\nthe leg goes back to the same position. ***** ****** ******* ** *** ******** ** ** *** **** ** ********** The bad part is he also placed the \nblame on my mother once stating that the patient is not co-operating and the problem is in her mental \nstate and asked us to get counseling.\nThere is no sympathy from the doctor's side.**** ********* *** ************** **** ** **** **** * **** ****** ** *** *** ** ******** ********* **** **** **** \n\nAt present we are consulting another doctor and we are seeing improvements.\nAlthough the leg still isn't straight at least the pain has reduced a lot and there is no need to take painkillers.\n\nWe really regret getting this surgery done. We would never recommend this doctor to anyone.",

I told myself that how he was so right I thanked God and Dr Chirag.\nDr Chirag treated me with orthoscopy and HTO surgery on my right knee successfully 15 days ago.\nLong ago, I have got some meniscus injury but managed it with physio and regular exercises.  Over the last year, my pain has increased, and I referred the physio by an orthopaedic doctor. However, the pain has become medium severe over the previous two weeks.\nI went back to the same reputed hospital, where I showed earlier. After seeing the X-ray, the orthopaedic surgeon has advised me for the total knee replacement as an only option. With my shock, I agreed to the surgery immediately, but somehow, I was not convinced, considering my X-ray report.\nMy friends, known doctors and relatives have advised me for a second opinion. Also, I enquired from several patients who underwent such surgeries. Finally, I have referred to Dr Chirag firmly to have a second opinion before the knee replacement.\nDr Chirag has seen my X-ray and examines my knee movements physically, and at the outset, he said, you are not the candidate for the knee joint replacement. However, to decide the proper treatment, he asked me for an immediate MRI.\nRuling out total knee replacement, He gave me the right option for minimum invasive surgery to repair my Meniscus and bone realignment through arthroscopy and HTO, respectively.\nAfter two weeks of the successful surgery, I am recovering well and feeling relieved with the postoperative procedure.\nWhat I felt best with my treatment experience with Dr Chirag is his approach to conserve the natural knee joint as much as possible, correct diagnosis of the problem and treatment, a huge passion for his field, and his and his team's professionalism.\nI admire him a lot *** ***** *** ** *** **** *********** ******** ********* ********* ** *******My gratitude to you, Dr Chirag!\n",

In my case i needed an ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair . Its been 9 weeks since surgery and i am walking and jogging properly without any pain. Dr chirag sir also put me across to the best physio therapists and takes care of every patient so that they get right treatment. He has a wonderful team , they made me so comfortable during my stay in the hospital. I would like to thank all the team members of doctor especially dr suman sir  and also Yasmin mam at the clinic for all the support and taking care of all the appointments. I highly recommend dr chirag sir for any orthopaedic or sports injury.",

Since hospitals were not my choice, i decided to bear the pain, but it got to an imbearable situation and surgery was necessary.  So i decided to take an opinion from several doctors just so i could avoid the surgery. Then i was directed to see Dr. Chirag Thonse on the first visit the way it was communicated to me by Dr. Thonse. I got the confidence to agree to the surgery. On my 2nd visit I decided to go ahed with the surgery, for this I am happy my quick decision saved me a lot of pain, and the amazing thing was I started walking without assistance in the 3rd week. After physio I was able to start work within 50 days after the surgery. Thanks to Dr. Thonse.",

His office keeps track of every movement . More than the hospital, it was his office that bailed us out when the hospital service was inept and deficient.\nAlso, he does not overcharge,  more importantly, he has the mids touch on surgeries. I would advice potential patients to just submit themselves to his care. May God bless him.",

Dr Chirag is an excellent orthopedic and I would highly recommend him for an of my friends and colleagues suffering from ACL conditions.",

The only changing statement seemed to me was a surgery but the fear always remained to get into the right and experienced hands. Nevertheless I had heard a lot about Dr Chirag and he was beyond my expectations . He not only has an admiring personality but also has this charming personality and a humbleness towards his profession. I don't think I could get into much safer hands. Thanking you .",
