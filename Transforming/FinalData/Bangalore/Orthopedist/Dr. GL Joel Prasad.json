Tried all modalities but to no avail . All that was required was ' one touch to my spine  ' by Dr joel to diagnose right away that I had a bad muscle spasm and no bony issue . Though I requested for an x Ray he outrightly declined stating that an x Ray is of no use to me as he's already diagnosed the condition. Just one day of meds is all what I required to get significant relief in my symptoms . Very happy with his immaculate diagnosis, minimal investigation and treatment. ",

Consulted dr Joel for the same and what impressed me the most was his way of approach in talking to patients and allowing them to explain their issues completely . Further he examined me and explained that I had a small tear which needed a small surgery . He alleviated all my concerns about the condition and assured me that I will be as before following the surgery . I feel much better now and my knee feels strong and sturdy after the repair . Highly appreciate dr Joel for his healing hands and highly highly recommend him .",

I feel so much better after consulting him . Gives minimal meds and focuses more on allowing the body to heal. Highly recommend him. ",

Though I requested for an x Ray he outrightly declined stating that an x Ray is of no use to me as he's already diagnosed the condition. Just one day of meds is all what I required to get significant relief in my symptoms . Very happy with his immaculate diagnosis, minimal investigation and treatment. ",

He alleviated all my concerns about the condition and assured me that I will be as before following the surgery . I feel much better now and my knee feels strong and sturdy after the repair .
