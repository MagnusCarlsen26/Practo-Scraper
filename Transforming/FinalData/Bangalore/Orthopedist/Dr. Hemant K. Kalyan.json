Remember they had cancelled my appointment on Saturday earlier. \r\n\r\nI told that I can't come again. So I ll wait. As there were no seat vacant. I went out. Soon I got a seat and sat there for around 1 hour 15 mins. After which I enquired again. \r\n\r\nThe receptionist had not queued me. Thinking that I ve left. And hence had to wait more. \r\n\r\nThe staff their are not at all courteous and will always be in hurry. This being a doctor's clinic atleast patient expect to be heard.  Atleast treat people as people and not animal. \r\n\r\nI met doc after  2 hours of waiting. \r\n\r\nDoctor is very good. But this clinic is extremely bad. \r\n\r\n",

They cannot say what is potential wait time.\nManipal should review the setup.\n\nUpon meeting doctor, he completed consult in 2 mins with surgery is required and he can do it only tomorrow and cannot tell other slots available.\nHe didn\u2019t care to explain what is actual details of surgery and options. Just showed a picture.\nUpon reaching hospital that night , I was told ONLY general ward is available. This I returned and started to look for another doctors and hospital.\nThis episode has left me with bad feeling about Manipal management.",

They cannot say what is potential wait time.\nManipal should review the setup.\n\nUpon meeting doctor, he completed consult in 2 mins with surgery is required and he can do it only tomorrow and cannot tell other slots available.\nHe didn\u2019t care to explain what is actual details of surgery and options. Just showed a picture.\nUpon reaching hospital that night , I was told ONLY general ward is available. This I returned and started to look for another doctors and hospital.\nThis episode has left me with bad feeling about Manipal management.",
