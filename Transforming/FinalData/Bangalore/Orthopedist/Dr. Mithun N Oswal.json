He needed immediate surgery with titanium plates and it took nearly a year for him to walk properly again as he is a senior citizen. He eventually recovered well and fine now.\n\nFrom our first contact, the doctor promptly attended to my father's case, providing all the necessary care. Most good doctors fulfill their basic responsibilities, but only a few go the extra mile to ensure their patients receive the best care possible. This doctor did exactly that.\n\nHe ensured we received the right services at the Hospital, helped us through the insurance process, conscious about the budget, provided comprehensive information on the recovery timeline, and outlined the necessary measures and medications. He was also very attentive to my parents' needs, given their age, and was always available for direct assistance. \n\nGiven that my parents live in a different city, he followed up with them for weeks after the surgery to ensure my father was recovering well. He even provided a reference for another doctor in the other city if needed.\n\nI've never met a doctor like him and strongly recommend him for any orthopedic care.",

Most good doctors fulfill their basic responsibilities, but only a few go the extra mile to ensure their patients receive the best care possible. This doctor did exactly that.\n\nHe ensured we received the right services at the Hospital, helped us through the insurance process, conscious about the budget, provided comprehensive information on the recovery timeline, and outlined the necessary measures and medications. He was also very attentive to my parents' needs, given their age, and was always available for direct assistance. \n\nGiven that my parents live in a different city, he followed up with them for weeks after the surgery to ensure my father was recovering well. He even provided a reference for another doctor in the other city if needed.\n\nI've never met a doctor like him and strongly recommend him for any orthopedic care.",

I had a driving accident in 2020 which resulted in Radius Shaft Fracture with DRUJ Instability in my Left forearm. Under Dr. Mithun's consultation, I underwent surgery and recovered more than 95% of wrist movements within weeks. 2 weeks ago, I underwent another surgery under him to get the implants removed and have observed no pain since then.  He is soft spoken, explains the issue with care and in detail and takes care of his patients like family members. Henceforth, I highly  recommend him for any orthopaedic consultations. ",
