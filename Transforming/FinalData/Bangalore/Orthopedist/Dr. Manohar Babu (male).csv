"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spine Injury,",0,0,YES,"Dr Manohar Babu is Gem of a person. I had a spine injury in the month of Jan 2024. I am a crohn's patient . Because my disease was active i had become too weak to an extent that i could not even move my limbs. So taking  me to a doctor was impossible. I stay in Belagavi. So my daughter visited the  local doctors and asked for home visits. None of them obliged. Then she went to Bengaluru and visited Dr Manohar Babu and showed  the X-Ray and explained him thr problem. Without a second thought he started with the medication .and now i am almost normal. Because i was not in a position to go in for surgery,he treated me with just bedrest and simple medication. In addition he suggeste me for physiotherapy. Dr Raghvendra Singh ,KLE belagavi , helped me with physiotherapy.
His humility, patience and accurate
 treatment is worth appreciating. He is always available  on phone.. His is  compassionate . So talking to him was very nice. Thank you doctor. Ever grateful to you doctor. ",2024-07-19 13:23:56,False,True,Saraswati D. Joshi ,,,

Dr. Manohar helped us to explain the issue and the process of surgery which made us confident. He was very precise and patient to answer our questions.
The surgery he did was excellent. My son's thumb got in shape perfectly and the alignment was accurate. He recovered pretty fast and now he is quiet back at good health.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"Last April, my 12-year-old daughter experienced hip joint pain and had elevated ESR levels. We consulted several prominent orthopedicians in the city and underwent two MRIs, multiple X-rays, and two needle biopsies. Unfortunately, none of these provided a clear path to the right treatment.

Then we had the opportunity to consult with Dr. Manohar Babu sir. From our first consultation, we felt a renewed sense of hope and trust in him. He is a man of few words, but his actions speak volumes. The medications he prescribed alleviated her pain, but he wanted to ensure there were no other complications, so he suggested an open biopsy.

Dr. Manohar Babu sir prepared us mentally and gave us the confidence to trust him with our beloved daughter's care. Thanks to his expertise and the grace of God, the procedure went well. It has been almost a year since then, and our daughter is much better, with her symptoms completely vanished. Dr. Manohar Babu continues to guide us with regular consultations, providing us with a sense of ease and reassurance.

He has been our strength during a time when we felt lost and uncertain. We are deeply grateful for his dedication and care.",2024-05-27 19:28:03,False,True,Rajesh Manjunath,,,

Sir is very helpful for patients in early detection and diagnosis of ortho related problems and also helps in fast recovery of patients. He is very polite and listens patiently to all the concerns of patients. He is very capable of curing critical ortho cases with proper treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Disorders,",0,0,YES,"My mother had a very painful problem of limping and numbness in a leg for years. By sheer luck, we came across Dr Manohar Babu, an orthopaedist, and he detected the root cause within 2 days. (We had checked several places before that, but the problem went on undetected all the time.) Dr Babu turned out to be a life saver for her when it was revealed in a chest MRI that she had a benign tumour in the spine, which had been growing day by day.

Within 2 weeks of detection, we got her operated at Apollo, Bannerghata to remove the tumour. The surgery lasted for a mammoth 8+ hours, if we include the time spent in administering anesthesia and post operational monitoring by the doctors and paramedics. Dr Babu was very well assisted by Dr Karthik R, a neurosurgeon, in the procedure.

No words of gratitude would suffice for Dr Manohar Babu for saving the life of my mother, as I later I learnt that a number of people have lost their lives due to late or non-detection of the root cause in similar problems. I would highly recommend everybody to consult Dr Babu if you or any one you know suffers from any such problem. 

Since times immemorial, we have been reading that doctors are Gods in human form. I have seen with my own eyes the God in the form of Dr Manohar Babu.  Dr Babu, May God bless you with a long and healthy life and bless you and your family with all the happiness and good health.",2021-06-08 10:44:57,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
