                "review_text": "Dr Vivek is very much intelligent as a Doctor and an honest and humble person to help patients. The first time I broke my left knee, other doctors suggested knee surgery, but Dr. Vivek examined my leg physically and X-ray carefully and confirmed that only 4-5 weeks of rest with a belt (or plaster) is required and really after 5 weeks, my leg was like the way it was before without any surgery.\n Unfortunately, the second time my right ankle was fractured and he suggested around 10 days rest due to swelling on my right leg ankle. For double confirmation, I consulted other Hospital (Ortho Special), and they suggested 2 surgeries. One for outer roads which will help in reducing swelling and the second for plates which can be operated once the swelling is cured.  Again, Dr. Vivek saved me from one extra operation, he asked me to wait as he was sure that the swelling will be reduced (by keeping my leg up the whole time). And then he directly operated directly for plate placement. \nIt is 3 months now after surgery and I am fully fine like before. Last week when I started walking there was a pain in my leg but Dr asked me to keep it up with some additional exercise. Now I am thankful to this generous and humble person. I would surely recommend to get his consultation before any otrho related issues or surgery.",

We rushed to the hospital and he handled the situation in a very calm and collected way. He took a quick X-ray of the hand and suggested a small surgery which was successful without conducting other unnecessary tests. This is a review that I am writing after 15 days of the incident and my son is doing great. While I have seen other kids with a lot of problems in their treatment, leading to less mobility, such issues are not bothering us.\n\nI would definitely recommend anyone Dr Vivek for any kind of Orthopedic issue .",
