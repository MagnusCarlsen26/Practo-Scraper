I went to a very famous hospital and all that i got is plan and packages. \n\nThrough some colleagues i got to kmow about doc Suresh and reached Apollo spectra. The care that he took to me was amazing.\n\nHe promised me that my surgery will be pain less and he delivered more than that. It is 4 th week now after the surgery and guess what i am typing with both hands. \n\nTo me he is a saviour. My suggestion to you is please do visit with proper appointment, however if it is emergency he give give priority to you.\n\nThank you doctor.",

Soft tissue can be relatively diagnosed  clinically and bony problem should be addressed with help of x.rays . Regarding the exercises if the principles of the exercises are not followed then defenitely pain will increase. And I don't think you had come for review again. Regarding later quiry it's your body which has to respond to the treatment not to blame the medicines or the doctor. Me watching cctv camera will be for a purpose and answering a pH call would be for some emergency from hospital Regards Dr Suresh",

Soft tissue can be relatively diagnosed  clinically and bony problem should be addressed with help of x.rays . Regarding the exercises if the principles of the exercises are not followed then defenitely pain will increase. And I don't think you had come for review again. Regarding later quiry it's your body which has to respond to the treatment not to blame the medicines or the doctor. Me watching cctv camera will be for a purpose and answering a pH call would be for some emergency from hospital Regards Dr Suresh",

When I saw Dr. Suresh Kumar profile I felt his profile is the best suite for my problem. Doctor Identified the problem Immediately by physical examine , but to verify he asked me to go to scan. \n\nFinally the scan results are same as he told to me. He suggested to  undergo for a surgery. Surgery completed successfully and my heeling is fast, I am recovering well.  These are the his expertise's in giving treatment patients. He is the best in Peroneal Tendon related issues\n\nThe best part is he will talk to you very politely , he is calm and listen to your problem. The way he treats to his patients is awesome. ",
