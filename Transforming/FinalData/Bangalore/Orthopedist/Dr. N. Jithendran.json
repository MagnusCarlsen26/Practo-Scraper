I visited him for a tendon injury in my left hand with little hope of recovery, as my first surgery with a different doctor had failed, and I needed tendon grafting for the second attempt. Despite my low expectations, I proceeded with the surgery. Thanks to Dr. Jithendran's extensive experience, I was able to recover 90% within a month. My heartfelt thanks to the doctor for the great results.\n\nDr. Iyer's approach is compassionate and thorough, which made me feel confident and comfortable throughout the process. His expertise and dedication are evident in his work, and I am grateful for the care and support he provided. I highly recommend Dr. Jithendran Iyer to anyone in need of plastic surgery or consultation.\n\nUpdate after 2 months: Blessed with a baby boy. I have fully recovered and am now able to hold my newborn son properly. I am incredibly grateful to doctor for making this possible",

But he assured that it will be cleared after couple of months so that his nose looks 100% natural.

Despite my low expectations, I proceeded with the surgery. Thanks to Dr. Jithendran's extensive experience, I was able to recover 90% within a month. My heartfelt thanks to the doctor for the great results.\n\nDr. Iyer's approach is compassionate and thorough, which made me feel confident and comfortable throughout the process. His expertise and dedication are evident in his work, and I am grateful for the care and support he provided. I highly recommend Dr. Jithendran Iyer to anyone in need of plastic surgery or consultation.\n\nUpdate after 2 months: Blessed with a baby boy. I have fully recovered and am now able to hold my newborn son properly. I am incredibly grateful to doctor for making this possible",

Upon searching for guidance, I came across positive Google reviews about Mr. Jitendran. I promptly contacted him, and to my relief, he not only provided immediate guidance on precautions to take for the amputated finger but also shared relevant videos through WhatsApp. \n\nOn the 2nd of August, we reached Bangalore at 12:30 PM. Even before we arrived at the hospital, Mr. Jitendran had already communicated with the staff to prepare the operation theater. However, as we weren't fully aware of how serious is the surgery and the duration it would require, we had concerns about the financial aspects. Unfortunately, due to these concerns, we hesitated and decided to return to our hometown.\n\nUpon reaching a nearby hospital, we came to comprehend the severity of the injury. Realizing the urgency, the parents made the decision to proceed with the surgery despite the late hour of 10:00 PM. I immediately reached out to Mr. Jitendran, explained the situation, and he assured us that he would perform the surgery.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, at 2:45 AM, the operation theater was readied, and by 3:20 AM, the surgery commenced. The procedure concluded at 11:40 AM, and I am immensely grateful that it went well. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Jitendran for his exceptional kindness, dedication, and commitment.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend consulting Mr. Jitendran for any surgical needs, given his remarkable qualities:\n\n1. **Patience:** His patient and attentive approach helps ease anxieties.\n2. **Availability:** Mr. Jitendran's responsiveness is unparalleled. He promptly attends to queries through WhatsApp and phone calls.\n3. **Dedication:** His unwavering commitment to his patients' well-being is truly commendable.\n4. **Friendliness:** He creates a comfortable environment with his friendly disposition.\n5. **Down-to-Earth:** Despite his expertise, he remains approachable and grounded.\n\nIt is because of these qualities that I firmly believe he is an excellent choice for any surgical consultation or medical assistance within his specialization. Once again, a heartfelt thank you to Mr. Jitendran for his exceptional care and support.\n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to the staff and administrative department of TrustWell Hospital for their exceptional cooperation and support, even in the early hours. Your dedication and assistance are deeply appreciated.",

Before discovering Dr. Jitendra, we had visited several Multispecialty hospitals and consulted with various experts. While I acknowledge the capabilities of those professionals, our primary concern was finding a surgeon who would not only possess the necessary skills but also exhibit genuine care and compassion towards our young child. We were fortunate to have found Dr. Jitendra, whose attentiveness and dedication surpassed our expectations. I firmly believe that he extends the same level of attention and care to all his patients.\nDr. Jitendra's vast experience as a surgeon is evident when one delves into the numerous blogs he has authored, showcasing the successful completion of complex plastic surgeries. Over the years, his extensive training has equipped him to handle even the most challenging cases with ease. I can only imagine the immense difficulty involved in performing delicate sutures on my son's tiny hands, given his tender age of one. It is with profound gratitude towards both God and Dr. Jitendra that I can confidently state that everything went exceptionally well.\nLastly, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Dr. Jitendra for his approachability and accessibility throughout this entire process. His talent and skill will undoubtedly benefit many others, and I wish him continued success in his career.",

With good care was given to him . We\u2019re happy that my brother is 80% recovered  and for that we have been to Dr.Jithendran for treatment , he has recovered almost now . \nIt\u2019s a great honour even to write about you, most importantly the way you try to improve yourself as a better doctor and keeping in touch with your patients is so heart touching.\nI strongly believe doctor is not someone who just cure illness of the patient but also boosts the morale of the patient so that they can feel much better than ever. it was there in your treatment for sure.what else can one ask for from a doctor.\n To put simple about how to express my gratitude \u2013 No one wants to see a doctor being a patient,  but it\u2019s worth to keep in contact with someone like you who is a well established overall person.\nIts so good to see my father come back to normal , thanks for your treatment with personal care .\nThanks for your support sir.

He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, answer all of my questions, and ensure that I felt comfortable throughout the entire process. His expertise and attention to detail were evident from the beginning.\n\nThe surgery itself was a complete success, and I experienced minimal pain and discomfort during the recovery period. Dr. Jithendra's surgical skills are truly remarkable, and I couldn't have asked for a better outcome.\n\nFurthermore, the post-operative care and follow-up appointments were just as impressive. Dr. Jithendra and his team closely monitored my progress, provided guidance on wound care, and made sure I was healing properly. Their dedication to my well-being was evident at every stage.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Jithendra to anyone in need of lipoma surgery. His professionalism, surgical skill, and compassionate care are second to none. My experience under his care was outstanding, and I am grateful for the excellent results. Thank you, Dr. Jithendra, for your expertise and the positive impact you've had on my life.",

Came back to Bangalore, as I work here. After 10 days also , I was not able to lift my fingers. Got worried and contacted Dr. Jiten after seeing reviews on practo and Google. Went to sparsh hospital near Bomsandra. After seeing my hand he just told it's a tendon cut, will have to do surgery . Got admitted same day. He reopened my stichtes and repair all the tendon cut in 1 hour. As it was 13 days old cut, it was difficult to do, but he did it nicely. Next day I was discharged from hospital. Visited every week for status and feedback. After one month, got physiotherapy kit . And now after 1 more month , I am typing with same fingers. Got my all fingers working like normal. Able to do my code as well daily work with my right hand easily. Thanks to him, who made my life normal. He has always smiling face. He talks like a Friend.

Accidently I poured very hot boiling water on to my feet. Never knew that I will start getting such huge boils on all my toes. Thought this kind of boils is justcommon and went to a clinic close by to my working place. I leant a  very hard lesson from the treatment given to me.whom to trust and whom not to? My treatment was so bad that it worsened the situation.  Actually, on 14th of December,  2018 I stepped into Sparsh to get my leg dressed up . Sometimes we hear say that things do happen for a purpose. I stepped into Sparsh because the doctor with whom I was taking my treatment prior was unavailable..probably this was another way of God to save my leg. I was attended by Dr Jitendra immediately and the very same day was admitted because the condition of my leg was very bad.After a week I was discharged with an advice for the Skin grafting for speedy recovery.  Though my husband was insisting on getting my skin grafting done in Hyderabad, because he works there , I was confident on Dr Jitendra only.i got my skin grafting done this 12th January and I am happy that my toes are getting better day by day.thank God I was in good hands and I should congratulate the entire  team for their dedicated work...kudos to the whole crew.

When shown it to local doctor they said not possible to recover the finger so suggested to take it to Sparsh hospital. We had come with little hope. The surgery was done only next day by dr. Jitendran. After a week of surgery one finger recovered well but  other with 95% ambutation  had chance of bone exposure but can wait for 3 weeks to. Check the progress . We didn't want to go for surgery so we preferred waiting to see if it heels. During this period we had regular visits  to doctor on weekly basis.Later as it was not heeling after 3 weeks So doctor suggested to do resurgery. And this time he said cross finger surgery was required. My wife was really worried as this would mean two more surgery. But by doctors magic and god's grace, this operation was ended up just reconstruction of finger and nail bud repair. Later after few weeks that finger also got rectified. We were really happy that we got the fingers and nails back and able to function normally after almost 4 months. We are really great full to dr.jitendran for bring back her fingers to normal. ",

However, from the moment I met you, your warm and compassionate nature put me at ease. Your deep knowledge and experience in plastic surgery were evident, and I knew I was in capable hands.\n\nThe surgery you performed four months ago has been a life-changing experience for me. Not only have you skillfully corrected the appearance of my finger, but you have also restored its functionality, allowing me to do things I thought I would never be able to do again.\n\nI am truly amazed by the results and cannot thank you enough for the positive impact you have had on my life. The transformation has not only improved my physical well-being but has also given me newfound confidence and self-assurance.\n\nYour dedication and commitment to your patients are commendable, and I am grateful for the genuine care and attention you provided throughout the entire process. You have not only helped heal my finger but also brought closure to a chapter of my life that had long been a source of discomfort.\n\nDr. Jitendran, you are not only an exceptional plastic surgeon but also a wonderful human being. Thank you for making this journey to recovery so smooth and successful. I am forever indebted to you for your remarkable skills and compassionate care.\nThank you!!",

Jithendran, for the exceptional care and expertise provided during my recent surgery for an amputated right thumb. In fact before meeting Dr. N. Jitherndran we visited two hospital's - Trust-In Hospital and HOSMAT Hospital both the hospital examined me and told that we cant get the amputated finger back to life, as a miracle with help of my Uncle Mr. Edward Jeevan we connected to Dr. Manish Samson (Apollo Hospitals) with his reference we were able to connect with the Plastic and Reconstructive surgeon Dr. N. Jithendran. From the moment I entered the hospital, Dr. N. Jithendran and their team ensured that I felt comfortable and confident in their abilities.\\n\\nDr. N. Jithendran demonstrated a remarkable level of skill and precision throughout the entire surgical process. Their knowledge and experience were evident, and they went above and beyond to explain the procedure to me, addressing all my concerns and ensuring that I fully understood what to expect.\\n\\nNot only did Dr. N. Jithendran successfully reattach my amputated finger, but they also took the time to provide thorough post-operative care instructions. They showed genuine compassion and empathy, making me feel supported during the recovery period. Thanks to their meticulous work and attentiveness, my finger is healing well, and I am already regaining functionality.\\n\\nI am incredibly grateful to have been under the care of such a skilled and compassionate surgeon like Dr. N. Jithendran. Their professionalism, expertise, and genuine care for their patients make them an outstanding healthcare provider. I would highly recommend Dr. N. Jithendran to anyone in need of specialized surgical care. Thank you once again for your remarkable skills and the positive impact you've had on my life.\\",

Within 15 minutes I went to the nearest orthopaedic hospital, however the doctor & team concluded that they needed to cut the exposed bone of the finger top (amputation) & close it, which means shortening the finger. Luckily God\u2019s grace before taking me to OT, I called my friend Dr. Soumya (Sasya Sanjeevini Panchakarma Center, Gokarna) & explained my situation to her. She contacted Dr. Narayan Hegde Mysore immediately & he gave Dr. N Jithendran Sir\u2019s contact details. I reached out to Dr. N Jithendran Sir via call and explained whatever I can and shared pics via WhatsApp. He told me to come to his clinic and assured me no need to cut my finger. Initially the nearest\u00a0hospital doctor was not ready to discharge me & then Dr. Jithendran Sir convinced\u00a0him via call, then I went to Dr. Jithendran Sir's clinic. He inspected my finger & gave 2 possible\u00a0options, i.e., refixing the finger top or reconstruction of the lost finger top depends on the tissues condition of the crushed part. Later he found that the crushed part was unfit for refixing (microscopic observation) and went for reconstruction of the lost finger top using the cross finger flap method.\u00a0After regular follow\u00a0up/ checkup, I am glad to say that Dr. Jithendran Sir saved my finger, else it would have been a lifetime regret. Dr. Jithendran Sir is very clear about the methodologies and final outcome. and\u00a0He is very reachable for any doubts and most importantly he is very kind hearted. I am recovering now and my finger\u00a0is almost fine, it will take some more time to\u00a0complete recovery. However I am relieved\u00a0a lot now compared to the day the tragic incident happened. I am grateful to Dr. Jithendran Sir forever for saving my finger & my friend Dr. Soumya for giving the lead. In words I can not explain my gratitude towards Dr. Jithendran Sir, just beyond the limits.\n*** ** *** **** ****** * ****",

Third finger without first cut of it... As I have lost full first cut with bone... It's wasn't possible to extend the length at the time.\n\nI was unable to provide my missing parts to doctor due to misguided instruction by a doctor at my town... But even then doctor done a complex surgery to get my fingers functioning.\n\nHere is my story of accident\n----------------------------\n\nAt a Friday evening 5pm\nI had cut three fingers on my hand while cleaning my bike chain, then I immediately went to nearest hospital in my town Dharmapuri, TN.\n\nAt 5:20pm... The doctor from that hospital simply said this can't be attached, only flap is possible... didn't believe that was the case...\n\nthen at 9:00pm I immediately travelled to Bangalore St John's hospital there doctors asked me for missing parts, but sadly the hospital at my town simply dumped those in bin saying it's no use \ud83d\ude22. Then the doctor from St.johns told that without missing parts it's not possible to get fingers back to the same length.\n\nI was devastated \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22, lost hope and admitted for morning surgery.\n\nThen my sister was with me at the time to help me out, started searching in Google/Practo for surgeon in Bangalore... then we found Dr N.Jithendran and then we called him...\n\nWe called him morning at 8pm,\nHe picked our call immediately and asked about our case then he immediately understood and told us there was a possibility of reconstructive surgery...\n\nThen I was discharged from st John's and went to Phoenix hospital where Dr N Jithendran also arrived and performed the surgery.\n\nI was surprised at the speed and hope he gave... I'm so blessed now by Dr Jithendran sir... My fingers are functioning back like normal and now I can write and do work.",

I\u2019m really glad, i met the doctor and got the surgery under his guidance. I would say he is the best when it comes to customised patient care.

The results were really great and the finger seems to have developed like original. \nBest thing about Dr Jithendran is apart from being very professional he is very empathetic as well. Although he was very busy, but he was always able to provide quick feedbacks via mobile. \nI would highly remommend him.",

My son underwent a plastic surgery in his right leg. His right leg muscles and skin was crushed in a accident. He was in a severe pain when we reached Dr. Jithendran. Dr. Jithendran was very confident that he would save my sons leg. He also gave us good support and confidence throughout my sons treatment. As promised my sons leg was saved. He is in recovery and Dr. Jithendran is still guiding us. He was honest and humble to us throughout the treatment. He has a great positive vibe and a cheerful gesture with the patients. I am thankful and grateful for his help and wish him all the best for his upcoming endeavour in future",

We found him online when my 6 years old daughter got hurt with a swing while playing and got a large vertical cut in lower lip. Three doctors told us that she needs surgery for the cut - which required anesthesia. That is when we found Dr Jitendran online. First he entertained us at 10PM at his apartment as the clinic was closed.  He told us that the surgery isn't mandatorily required and if required, it can also be taken care of when the kid grows up. He recommended cleaning up the wound and applying T-bact. Within a week, the wound healed. There is a negligible scar, visible only when looked very closely, which might go away as the kid grows up. Thank you Dr. Jitendran for taking the time out of your personal life and entertaining us late night - and most important - avoiding the unnecessary surgery on 6 year old kid. ",

He just predicted what may the reason for heavy blood flow. Later he found the Root cause for the continuous flowing of blood & gave solution for it & later he did the Operation Successfully. From Analysis of blood flow until operation, he calmly explained the each & every procedure with possibilities. Now I see very good improvement in my brother foot. I just want to say you Thank you Sir\u2026.!",

Barring the initial anaesthetic injection, I didn\u2019t feel a thing, it was completely painless, and he managed to extricate the entire tumor in a clean and precise manner. \n\nWhat makes Dr. Jithendran a truly phenomenal surgeon beyond his experience and impeccable skill, is his commitment to contributing to the medical fraternity by sharing his vast experience. I was pleased to see that due to this procedure being rather rare because of the uncommon location of the glomus tumor, he recorded the entire process with my consent while explaining every step so that it would benefit other surgeons should they come across a case similar to this. \n\nIt was important to me to find a doctor who not only possesses the skill to perform complex procedures but who also prioritizes patient care. I am very fortunate to have found Dr. Jithendran who possessed both qualities in abundance, and would highly recommend him. ",

Then I was very happy that the injury can cure without the surgery as other doctors prefered only surgery for cure. Then Dr. Jithendran sir did a casting to my left hand and asked me to give it a rest for 4 weeks. Then after 4weeks he removed my casting and to do exercise my left hand in hot water for 15days. Now my hand is recovered and there is no pain. I am very grateful and thankful to Dr. Jithendran sir. I am really happy.",

After a lots of research I came to know about Dr N. Jithendran. I met him at Apollo Clinic. He recommended to go for surgery (the only cure for gynecomastia) and assured that it would be painless, scarless. Trust me, the surgery was done neatly with no scar and the procedure was completely painless and hassle free. It\u2019s the 4th day after the surgery, and I am able to move freely and do my regular routine work. If anyone\u2019s having gynecomastia, I highly recommend Dr N Jithendran who is highly experienced and at the same time very polite and friendly as a human being. I\u2019ll always be grateful to Dr N Jithendran for giving my life a new shape and confidence. ",

Jithendran and saw many good reviews about him. I met him at Phoenix hospital. I found him to be very down to earth and he patiently cleared all my doubts. The surgery was completed on 24/09 and I was discharged from the hospital on the same day. After the surgery there was no discomfort and surprisingly there was no visible mark on my chest. No one would ever make out that I had this surgery - it was a literally spotless. Also, I could go back to work with 1 day of rest. Post surgery he proactively contacted me and checked if I am doing fine. With Dr. Jithendran you are in \u2018safe hands\u2019 and he is truly a magical surgeon. I am very happy with the outcome and highly recommend him for any Plastic and Reconstructive surgeries. Thank you to Dr.Jithendran and team !!",

Jitendran, and without further adue we contacted him and booked a flight from Chittagong, Bangladesh afterwards. At first we were about nervous about the whole surgery processing, but with much carefulness he explained us everything and we felt relieved. He and his team were so much dedicated towards the whole surgery and even after the surgery as well. It's been 2 months since her surgery took place, and we are satisfied by the hospitality and care.",
