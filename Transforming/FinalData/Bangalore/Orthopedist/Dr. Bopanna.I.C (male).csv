When it comes to this doctor, he talks very nicely, he gave a suggestion about what we have to do, what treatment I need to take, he explained clearly about my problem. I had a spinal cord problem so I visited many hospitals but they said to do the operation but this doctor told me that there is no need of operation for now taking medicines we will see later. He gave a lot of time for the consultation, ** **** **** ********** I would recommend the doctor to my friends. I am very happy with the explanation of my health issue.
