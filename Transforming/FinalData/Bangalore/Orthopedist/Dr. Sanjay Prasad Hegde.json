I was also treated with food, rest and supplements alone and a detailed dos and don'ts to get normal from the joints issue I had. He is very lively caring Doctor who simplifies the problem for a patient. He also accurately diagnoses what the problem is. If we simply adopt the suggestions he guides to get over with the problem, then we are sorted. I recommended Dr Hegde to many people and everyone had tremendous recovery. I also depend on Dr Hegde for other doctors reference because of the immense faith in his knowledge and kindness. We need more doctors like him in the world.",

I was wrongly treated for arthritis by a popular specialist in bangalore and I was almost bed ridden when my father took me to his doctor - Dr Sanjay Prasad Hegde. Dr Hegde had already treated my father's knee problem - avoided knee replacement surgery, and got him to be normal in 6 months. I was also treated with food, rest and supplements alone and a detailed dos and don'ts to get normal from the joints issue I had. He is very lively caring Doctor who simplifies the problem for a patient. He also accurately diagnoses what the problem is. If we simply adopt the suggestions he guides to get over with the problem, then we are sorted. I recommended Dr Hegde to many people and everyone had tremendous recovery. I also depend on Dr Hegde for other doctors reference because of the immense faith in his knowledge and kindness. We need more doctors like him in the world.",
