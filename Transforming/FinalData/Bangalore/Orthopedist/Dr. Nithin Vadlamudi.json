My father 72 Years undergone hip surgery on 15-Sep-20. *** ****** ** *** ****** ******* ** ************ *** **** **** ** **** ******* He was so genuine, responsible, caring, concerned about us that cannot be described through words. More than all as per my personal experience I have never seen a surgeon being so helpful, supportive, healer & kind. In my view the other name for humanity is Dr. Nithin Vadlamudi. He possesses great skill of surgery. My father is now started walking with the help of walker & I'm sure he will start walking normally in coming days. Dr. Nithin is a professional who just don't do his job as just another job he does it with 100% & long lasting cure. He respects his profession & more importantly he follows it ethically. This behaviour of Dr. Nithin remains same to every patient he meets, which is unbelievable. He even helped us reducing hospital charges, implant expenses & above all this he even waived off his charges with the hospital & asked them not to charge us (imagine who will do this in today's world).Dr. Nithin is my super hero, inspiration, idol & next to God.My father's wound also got completely healed in just 7 days from surgery. The time he came out of the OT & said operation went very well. I had a smile with tears. It's all because of you sir. Dr. Nithin & his clinic receptionist was constantly following up since my first appointment in their clinic in fact even today i receive whatsapp message asking about my dad's condition. What else for a patient want.* **** *** ****** *** *** **** *** ******* **** ***** ******* ******",

I went with my father for checkup knee pain and he has listened to my father\u2019s problem and answered all our questions. He made me understand the root cause of the pain. He did the operation in Apollo hospital and 3rd days onward my father able to walk and he was helped us too much. So, he is the best orthopaedic surgeon and an excellent doctor I met till date I can vouch him for any Orthopaedic issues.\n\nI would highly recommend VNC Orthopaedic Clinic and he doesn't charge too much. I must say that it's so hard to find an honest doctor like Dr Nithin \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb.\n\nSpecially thanks Mahendra (Physiotherapist) was also very friendly, patience and polite doctor and the way he handled each session of physiotherapy helped my mom to recover very well after the surgery. Overall it was a very good experience with the entire team.\n\nRegards,\nM Prasad Babu",

My father was almost standstill for last few years and even taking 5 steps was a hard thing for him. Luckly I found VNC Clinic online and spoke to Dr Nithin initially. What amazed me is his humbleness to listen. I remember it was an one hour consultation call during lockdown wherein Dr Nithin saw all reports of my father over whatsapp and explained me his views and how should we go about it.\n\nAround 45 days later, Dr Nithin operated my father and ensured a smooth hospital discharge after 5 days. His engagement level with my father and with me had been out of the world. He is always approachable, listens to your problems and provides a well round consultation and follow up conversations. Post discharge, Dr Nithin kept a constant watch on my father's improvement and progress. He makes best use of the technology to stay engaged with the patient and caretakers. This gave lot of flexibility to me to ensure that my father does not have to venture out unnecessarily during Covid times.\n\nBesides being a skillful surgeon, Dr Nithin is a very humble human being and comes out as a well rounded personality with full of empathy - this is a hall mark of his character and the efficacy of his clinic. VNC premise is nice and clean. Receptionist is very helpful and ensures you and your patient is well taken care during entire patient engagement lifecycle.\n\nI would never forget his gesture when he drove down to see off my father on the road after being discharged.\n\nDr Nithin also diagnosed my mother's back problem and referred the case to more suitable spine surgeon. My mother got operated a month later by different surgeon but Dr Nithin ensured that he is present during surgery and have daily engagement level with my mother during her hospitalization.\n\nThank you VNC and Dr Nithin for your exemplary patient service. I wish you a great journey ahead in serving the patients and people in need.\n\nWith Gratitude !\nVineet Sood",

He told me the side effects as well, that I will feel dizzy for first two days of medication. You should visit him for any muscle, ortho issues. If you treated or treating with some other doctor and not completely satisfied, you can definitely visit him once to get a second opinion. I made three visits due to on and off strains. He said my upper back will recover slowly and suggests stretch exercises. I felt completely satisfied with each vist. Thanks Dr. Nithin.",

My father 72 Years undergone hip surgery on 15-Sep-20. *** ****** ** *** ****** ******* ** ************ *** **** **** ** **** ******* He was so genuine, responsible, caring, concerned about us that cannot be described through words. More than all as per my personal experience I have never seen a surgeon being so helpful, supportive, healer & kind. In my view the other name for humanity is Dr. Nithin Vadlamudi. He possesses great skill of surgery. My father is now started walking with the help of walker & I'm sure he will start walking normally in coming days. Dr. Nithin is a professional who just don't do his job as just another job he does it with 100% & long lasting cure. He respects his profession & more importantly he follows it ethically. This behaviour of Dr. Nithin remains same to every patient he meets, which is unbelievable. He even helped us reducing hospital charges, implant expenses & above all this he even waived off his charges with the hospital & asked them not to charge us (imagine who will do this in today's world).Dr. Nithin is my super hero, inspiration, idol & next to God.My father's wound also got completely healed in just 7 days from surgery. The time he came out of the OT & said operation went very well. I had a smile with tears. It's all because of you sir. Dr. Nithin & his clinic receptionist was constantly following up since my first appointment in their clinic in fact even today i receive whatsapp message asking about my dad's condition. What else for a patient want.* **** *** ****** *** *** **** *** ******* **** ***** ******* ******",

I went with my father for checkup knee pain and he has listened to my father\u2019s problem and answered all our questions. He made me understand the root cause of the pain. He did the operation in Apollo hospital and 3rd days onward my father able to walk and he was helped us too much. So, he is the best orthopaedic surgeon and an excellent doctor I met till date I can vouch him for any Orthopaedic issues.\n\nI would highly recommend VNC Orthopaedic Clinic and he doesn't charge too much. I must say that it's so hard to find an honest doctor like Dr Nithin \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb.\n\nSpecially thanks Mahendra (Physiotherapist) was also very friendly, patience and polite doctor and the way he handled each session of physiotherapy helped my mom to recover very well after the surgery. Overall it was a very good experience with the entire team.\n\nRegards,\nM Prasad Babu",

My father was almost standstill for last few years and even taking 5 steps was a hard thing for him. Luckly I found VNC Clinic online and spoke to Dr Nithin initially. What amazed me is his humbleness to listen. I remember it was an one hour consultation call during lockdown wherein Dr Nithin saw all reports of my father over whatsapp and explained me his views and how should we go about it.\n\nAround 45 days later, Dr Nithin operated my father and ensured a smooth hospital discharge after 5 days. His engagement level with my father and with me had been out of the world. He is always approachable, listens to your problems and provides a well round consultation and follow up conversations. Post discharge, Dr Nithin kept a constant watch on my father's improvement and progress. He makes best use of the technology to stay engaged with the patient and caretakers. This gave lot of flexibility to me to ensure that my father does not have to venture out unnecessarily during Covid times.\n\nBesides being a skillful surgeon, Dr Nithin is a very humble human being and comes out as a well rounded personality with full of empathy - this is a hall mark of his character and the efficacy of his clinic. VNC premise is nice and clean. Receptionist is very helpful and ensures you and your patient is well taken care during entire patient engagement lifecycle.\n\nI would never forget his gesture when he drove down to see off my father on the road after being discharged.\n\nDr Nithin also diagnosed my mother's back problem and referred the case to more suitable spine surgeon. My mother got operated a month later by different surgeon but Dr Nithin ensured that he is present during surgery and have daily engagement level with my mother during her hospitalization.\n\nThank you VNC and Dr Nithin for your exemplary patient service. I wish you a great journey ahead in serving the patients and people in need.\n\nWith Gratitude !\nVineet Sood",
