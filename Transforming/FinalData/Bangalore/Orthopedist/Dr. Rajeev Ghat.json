Yes, very much impressed with their coordination & management.\nThere are more reason why I am so much impressed by Dr. Naveen & Dr. Rajeev.\nI had come to \u2018Sports Orthopedics Institute\u2019 with my 4 yrs old AC Joint dislocation injury. This place was my last stop or destination of my hunt to know what are the treatment options I could have, for last 4yrs. Ever since the injury happened, I had seen 4 supposedly best orthopedic surgeons of the town, 2 among them were even foreign return retd. Doctors, but couldn\u2019t even tell me what has actually happened inside the skin at my left shoulder, why 1 of the bone end is bulging up and what should be done to it. One retd. Visiting doctor suggested me to undergo a month physiotherapy treatment (if I am not wrong then this works when issue is at rotator-cuff), however I got that done too very religiously (that costed me a bomb too), when the X-ray report had nothing about rotator-cuff.\nI tried again after 4 yrs to see if I can find some better doctor online, who can tell me what are the treatment options available for my injury in our country. In the process, read few recommendation about Dr. Dynamic Duo and gave a last try after complete disappointment for the doctors of the town. But to my surprise, I found them coming down to the phone line just like any friend awaiting for your call for quite sometime. Welcome with such a bright smile on their faces. But the most important thing for me was they kind of understood how exactly I had the injury in gym. Unlike any other clinic or doctors, they both examined me separately and suggested me very frankly, what can be done & what %age of strength can be expected back in future. Also, they were kind enough to suggest me should I go for the surgery or not.\nEven though this place is closely 30kms away from my place, now after meeting them I don\u2019t know any other orthopedic surgeons in Bangalore city for any future consultations(God forbid).",

Since I started experiencing the pain after a dance-fitness session, we first went forth with an X-Ray to look for possible fractures. Since the X-Ray didn't reveal any abnormalities, we went forth with an MRI to check for possible nerve damage. Meanwhile, I was able to move my fit a little more over the course of 3 days. When the MRI did not reveal any abnormalities either, he asked me if I had a tendency to cross my legs for too long. Turns out I had crossed my legs for too long and pinched the nerve which resulted in the foot drop. After a rest for about 3 weeks and some calcium and vitamin D supplements, I was good as new.\nI have rarely come across such amazing doctors who take time to explain to the patient what could be wrong and how they'll go about fixing it. And that too doing it right! Needless to say, this guy is an absolute gem.",

This place was my last stop or destination of my hunt to know what are the treatment options I could have, for last 4yrs. Ever since the injury happened, I had seen 4 supposedly best orthopedic surgeons of the town, 2 among them were even foreign return retd. Doctors, but couldn\u2019t even tell me what has actually happened inside the skin at my left shoulder, why 1 of the bone end is bulging up and what should be done to it. One retd. Visiting doctor suggested me to undergo a month physiotherapy treatment (if I am not wrong then this works when issue is at rotator-cuff), however I got that done too very religiously (that costed me a bomb too), when the X-ray report had nothing about rotator-cuff.\nI tried again after 4 yrs to see if I can find some better doctor online, who can tell me what are the treatment options available for my injury in our country. In the process, read few recommendation about Dr. Dynamic Duo and gave a last try after complete disappointment for the doctors of the town. But to my surprise, I found them coming down to the phone line just like any friend awaiting for your call for quite sometime. Welcome with such a bright smile on their faces. But the most important thing for me was they kind of understood how exactly I had the injury in gym. Unlike any other clinic or doctors, they both examined me separately and suggested me very frankly, what can be done & what %age of strength can be expected back in future. Also, they were kind enough to suggest me should I go for the surgery or not.\nEven though this place is closely 30kms away from my place, now after meeting them I don\u2019t know any other orthopedic surgeons in Bangalore city for any future consultations(God forbid).",

Since I started experiencing the pain after a dance-fitness session, we first went forth with an X-Ray to look for possible fractures. Since the X-Ray didn't reveal any abnormalities, we went forth with an MRI to check for possible nerve damage. Meanwhile, I was able to move my fit a little more over the course of 3 days. When the MRI did not reveal any abnormalities either, he asked me if I had a tendency to cross my legs for too long. Turns out I had crossed my legs for too long and pinched the nerve which resulted in the foot drop. After a rest for about 3 weeks and some calcium and vitamin D supplements, I was good as new.\nI have rarely come across such amazing doctors who take time to explain to the patient what could be wrong and how they'll go about fixing it. And that too doing it right! Needless to say, this guy is an absolute gem.",
