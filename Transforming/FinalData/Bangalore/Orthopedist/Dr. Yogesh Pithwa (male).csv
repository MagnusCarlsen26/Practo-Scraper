"Treatment satisfaction,","Spinal Therapy,",0,0,YES,"I visited the Doctor yesterday as I was not able to sleep due to backpain.  I went with a MRI report and he asked me some questions and also asked me to walk in three different formats in front of him. After he advised me to get MRI printouts along-with three x-rays. After  examining the Xrays and MRI printout,  he explained the causes for my paid and also advised me to get one blood test to give final opinion/advice. After the blood test he explained the gravity of the problem and prescribed medicines. I recommend the doctor as he spends time on examining the reports X-rays, MRI print outs etc., before giving final opinion and/or prescribing further course of action\. My only request to the Doctor is to give extra one or two minutes time to the patients if they have some doubts to clear. Since he did not explain what medicines I should take and what exercises I can do. To this question he said that everything is explained in the printouts. From the printout , I got 50% of the info / clarifications I wanted. I am visiting the Doctor on 4th of July, I hope he would give one or two minutes extra time to clear my doubts.  As I said the Doctor is very good in his evaluation of patients, only one suggestion to give a minute or two to clear the docuts.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My Mother-in-law was suffering with server pain left leg for couple of years and it was increasing over the time and it reached a stage where she was unable to stand/walk for more than 10min. we consulted couple of Ortho/Spine specialists and we were suggested to go for spine surgery to remove the disk compression and herniation to get rid of pain. After spending lots of time, We finally decided to go with Yogesh sir based on his credentials and experience. Based on the MRI and other reports, he suggested a 3level surgery (L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1) and  mentioned its going to be super-Major surgery. He explained clearly about severity of the case, risk involved in the surgery along with proposed surgical procedure. It is really appreciable the way he made us comfortable and built the confidence in my mother-in-law. Finally surgery was performed in the month of Aug 2022. The surgery went for more than 8hours and it was told all went well. It was informed that the disk compressions were removed at all 3levels and implanted Artificial cages at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.

my Mother-in-law started walking slowly on day-3 with the help of physiotherapist and we were discharged from hospital on day-6. She started recovering slowly - of course she had bit of tough time in the recovery process. But, the kind of support from Yogesh sir post surgery really helped her uplifting her confidence level and made her walk for more than 30min in a single stretch within 3weeks of time.  Its now 6months and she is completely free of pain and could lead her normal life without any sort of pain.

We would like to convey our sincere gratitude to Yogesh sir for giving her life back.

I strongly recommend Yogesh  sir for his finest skill-set, experience, post surgery care and the patient interaction.
