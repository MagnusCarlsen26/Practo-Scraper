Because good reviews can be bought and written by relatives but bad reviews r mostly genuine. \nAnyways so I took my mom today to see this doc. She has severe knee pain. So once he checked her knee and X ray he suggested that we could do 2 things. Surgery or Medication. So he said first go watch the AV. We did. Once we went bk to him he said ok so let me knw once u r ready. We said we did not want surgery yet but we wanted suppliments for time being till we make a decision. He said no supplements can help. I told him he said so and to give pain killer. To that he said go to a Family doctor. Seriously only if doctors knew how it feels to be on the other side patients would recover  half there itself by just doctor\u2019s consoling them. Anyways. The hospital \u201cApolo specially \u201c in Jayanagar was also very disappointing. No co Ordination. Not recommending at all",

As per his advice we got X-ray done and we went to show the report, Doctor Pai said both the knees are fine.. but when my mother In law said she is getting itching in both the knees in operated area...Doctor Sanjay Pai replied in a rude way that \"For that u should go to skin specialist \" if u have caugh will you come to me\" and showed the door to go out....my mother in law was getting itching only in knee operated area not on other part of body....I felt she asked a relevant question.... I felt Mr Sanjay Pai is very rude and unprofessional and doesn't give time to patients to explain their health issues.\nI dont recommend him. \nTill u get operated u ll be treated royaly and  any doubts will be answered but once after operation is done your treatment will be different ...\nI don't recommend him.",

Because good reviews can be bought and written by relatives but bad reviews r mostly genuine. \nAnyways so I took my mom today to see this doc. She has severe knee pain. So once he checked her knee and X ray he suggested that we could do 2 things. Surgery or Medication. So he said first go watch the AV. We did. Once we went bk to him he said ok so let me knw once u r ready. We said we did not want surgery yet but we wanted suppliments for time being till we make a decision. He said no supplements can help. I told him he said so and to give pain killer. To that he said go to a Family doctor. Seriously only if doctors knew how it feels to be on the other side patients would recover  half there itself by just doctor\u2019s consoling them. Anyways. The hospital \u201cApolo specially \u201c in Jayanagar was also very disappointing. No co Ordination. Not recommending at all",

In hurry burry he asked us to get XRay done... As per his advice we got X-ray done and we went to show the report, Doctor Pai said both the knees are fine.. but when my mother In law said she is getting itching in both the knees in operated area...Doctor Sanjay Pai replied in a rude way that \"For that u should go to skin specialist \" if u have caugh will you come to me\" and showed the door to go out....my mother in law was getting itching only in knee operated area not on other part of body....I felt she asked a relevant question.... I felt Mr Sanjay Pai is very rude and unprofessional and doesn't give time to patients to explain their health issues.\nI dont recommend him. \nTill u get operated u ll be treated royaly and  any doubts will be answered but once after operation is done your treatment will be different ...\nI don't recommend him.",
