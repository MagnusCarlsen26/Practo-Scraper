As the bone fracture was too much to do a plaster,he suggested for a minor surgery to fix an implant(as a long term/once and for all solution). We understood his suggestions and got admitted there same day.\nHe actively informed us about the OT availability which might delay the surgery. Though it took time OT to get free but afterwards rest of the procedure went very well and implant was fixed successfully(as planned) :-)\nHe regularly visited in ward after the surgery and cleared all our doubts. His team helped in preparing various necessary documents for insurance approval.\nBest thing about him is his politeness,vast experience and patience to answer all your queries. He never gets irritated while answering the queries.\nUnlike most of the Doctors, he shared his mobile number too in case of any help require!\n\nI strongly recommend him and his team! BIG thanks to them for all their help and expertise:-)",

As the bone fracture was too much to do a plaster,he suggested for a minor surgery to fix an implant(as a long term/once and for all solution). We understood his suggestions and got admitted there same day.\nHe actively informed us about the OT availability which might delay the surgery. Though it took time OT to get free but afterwards rest of the procedure went very well and implant was fixed successfully(as planned) :-)\nHe regularly visited in ward after the surgery and cleared all our doubts. His team helped in preparing various necessary documents for insurance approval.\nBest thing about him is his politeness,vast experience and patience to answer all your queries. He never gets irritated while answering the queries.\nUnlike most of the Doctors, he shared his mobile number too in case of any help require!\n\nI strongly recommend him and his team! BIG thanks to them for all their help and expertise:-)",
