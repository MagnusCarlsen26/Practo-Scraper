Dr Kocheeppan is a highly skilled orthopedic surgeon who instilled confidence throughout the entire process.\n\nHis expertise was evident from the initial consultation. He clearly explained the procedure, answered all my questions patiently, and addressed any concerns I had. During the surgery itself, I felt completely at ease thanks to his professionalism and experience.\n\nDr Kocheeppan encouraged me to start physiotherapy before the surgery, and this pre-surgical physiotherapy proved to be invaluable. As a result, my rehabilitation process after the surgery was smooth and pain-free. I'm now recovering well and on track for a full return to activity. Dr. Kocheeppan's surgical skill, guidance, and commitment to comprehensive patient care played a vital role in this positive outcome.\n\nMoreover, Dr Kocheeppan also performed a successful knee replacement surgery on my father-in-law, which further solidified my impression of him as a well-rounded and highly skilled orthopedic surgeon who excels in both ACL reconstruction and joint replacements.\n\nIf you're looking for a top-notch orthopedic surgeon for ACL reconstruction, knee replacement, or any other orthopedic need, I highly recommend Dr Pradeep Kocheeppan. His expertise, combined with his focus on comprehensive patient care, makes him an outstanding doctor.",

We kept the faith on him, and we were not wrong. He did the surgery, device implanted into the broken bones. After the accident, it was a dream for me that I would walk again. Yes, after the initial recovery period. I started walking prpoerly. I believe, it became possible because of Dr. Pradeep Kocheeppan's treatment. \nThank you Doctor. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

My father was loosing balance and was about to fall if I was not supporting him  that time. But doctor kept sitting.\n\n> After this  kind of examination and by reading the fathers  latest xray report ( done from a different hospital as asked by a different doctor) he immediately turned to my father and kept telling him that he should go only for knee replacement no matter what risk is there , but the patient and only the patient should  take that risk. He may die in the process but thats how it should be . He should be ready to take the risk by his own decision\n\n> He indirectly pointed towards me and kept telling my father that your children may not take your responsibility for operation but it is their duty to  take this up..  **** ** ********** ** **** ***** **** **** **** * * *** ** *** *** *** *** *** **** *** *** *** **** **** ** *** *** ****** *** **************.

Dr Kocheeppan is a highly skilled orthopedic surgeon who instilled confidence throughout the entire process.\n\nHis expertise was evident from the initial consultation. He clearly explained the procedure, answered all my questions patiently, and addressed any concerns I had. During the surgery itself, I felt completely at ease thanks to his professionalism and experience.\n\nDr Kocheeppan encouraged me to start physiotherapy before the surgery, and this pre-surgical physiotherapy proved to be invaluable. As a result, my rehabilitation process after the surgery was smooth and pain-free. I'm now recovering well and on track for a full return to activity. Dr. Kocheeppan's surgical skill, guidance, and commitment to comprehensive patient care played a vital role in this positive outcome.\n\nMoreover, Dr Kocheeppan also performed a successful knee replacement surgery on my father-in-law, which further solidified my impression of him as a well-rounded and highly skilled orthopedic surgeon who excels in both ACL reconstruction and joint replacements.\n\nIf you're looking for a top-notch orthopedic surgeon for ACL reconstruction, knee replacement, or any other orthopedic need, I highly recommend Dr Pradeep Kocheeppan. His expertise, combined with his focus on comprehensive patient care, makes him an outstanding doctor.",

After the preliminary investigation, Doctor at the emergency told us surgery needs to be done. In that situation first name of the Doctor came in our mind was Dr. Pradeep Kocheeppan as we visited earlier also, very nice, well behaved, has the ability to take right decision. We kept the faith on him, and we were not wrong. He did the surgery, device implanted into the broken bones. After the accident, it was a dream for me that I would walk again. Yes, after the initial recovery period. I started walking prpoerly. I believe, it became possible because of Dr. Pradeep Kocheeppan's treatment. \nThank you Doctor. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

Then it is upto you to decide if you are going to spend your time/ energy / money in seeing this doctor\n> The doctor did not even touch my father  or examined his knee by making him physically\n> The doctor kept sitting on his chair and asked my father (who is having balance issue as no strength in one knee) to stand erect by keeping his foot together so that he can observe the difference by sitting on his chair a far apart . My father was loosing balance and was about to fall if I was not supporting him  that time. But doctor kept sitting.\n\n> After this  kind of examination and by reading the fathers  latest xray report ( done from a different hospital as asked by a different doctor) he immediately turned to my father and kept telling him that he should go only for knee replacement no matter what risk is there , but the patient and only the patient should  take that risk. He may die in the process but thats how it should be . He should be ready to take the risk by his own decision\n\n> He indirectly pointed towards me and kept telling my father that your children may not take your responsibility for operation but it is their duty to  take this up..  **** ** ********** ** **** ***** **** **** **** * * *** ** *** *** *** *** *** **** *** *** *** **** **** ** *** *** ****** *** **************. Just that we are scared to take him for an operation at this age, as I also have an ailing mother to look after.

Still he stood far hands tied back and asked me about the exercise I do and I said yoga and at times I go to gym. Then he started Talking like scolding About the exercises that our generation do and I was asked to stand straight near wall and by just looking he concluded you will need a surgery on your legs because your legs are little bend and if you dont  go for surgery now but you will have to do It in your future to correct your legs it seems And then told me now you do these tests and come back whenever youre done and I was like what.

After I got complete knee extension, then surgery was fixed.\n\nDuring my stay @ Apollo Jayanagar in July, Dr. Pradeep and his team successfully operated my ACL. Since there was also a tear of meniscus, Dr. Pradeep recommended me to loose my weight and told that strictly I should not have belly fat. Doctor prescribed me a 1200 cal diet and Core Strengthening exercise. \n\nI followed Dr.Monica's (Physiotheraphist) advice for the post-operative physiotherapy and core strengthening exercise. \n\nIts been 5 months now, I'm very happy with Dr.Pradeep's team.\n\nOne should carefully listen to what doctor's are saying and strictly following to what they are saying. \n\nI Thank Dr. Pradeep & team and Apollo hospital for taking care of me.\n",

If I have paid for 15 minutes of time-slot, why does the doctor wishes me to get out within 4-5 minutes? A patient needs to understand about the root cause, prevention and cure better and it is just fair to let them have the share of Doctor's time for which they have been duly compensated. \n\nAlso, I wanted to know more about what will happen in case of a relapse for which I didn't get a clear response. Please note that a back pain/ spinal injury is a very painstaking experience and a patient would be scared of not getting it again. \n\nI have a lot of respect for medical profession and I hope the doctor takes this feedback in a constructive way.",
