Since the X-Ray didn't reveal any abnormalities, we went forth with an MRI to check for possible nerve damage. Meanwhile, I was able to move my fit a little more over the course of 3 days. When the MRI did not reveal any abnormalities either, he asked me if I had a tendency to cross my legs for too long. Turns out I had crossed my legs for too long and pinched the nerve which resulted in the foot drop. After a rest for about 3 weeks and some calcium and vitamin D supplements, I was good as new.
