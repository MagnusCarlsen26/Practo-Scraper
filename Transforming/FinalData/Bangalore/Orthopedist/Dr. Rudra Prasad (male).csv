"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,Meniscus Injury,Knee Arthroscopy,",0,0,YES,"Let me be very specific. I tore my ACL way back in 2017. I was in search of a good doctor to replace it for almost 3 years. i did my homework by researching websites, taking multiple consultations with 10+ orthopaedic surgeons, going to Udupi kasturba Manipal all the way from Bengaluru to meet the case expert and I even went to the extent of meeting Indian orthopedic association chairman. Eveywhere i heard only one name Dr. Rudraprasad! zeroing in on the doctor, i started my R&D right from his date of birth to his medical license number, his year of graduation, his awards accolade and what not. Finally after many years of painstaking research, money spent, it was crystal clear in my  mind that, It was dr. rudraprasad, the doctor i should go for.. to much of my amazement he stayed just few blocks away from my home in Bengaluru!!

When i met him, it was all ease right from diagnosis of the issue to explanation of the problem.. Finally we fixed a date of surgery.. I had trusted him so much that, my anaesthetist told me i was murmuring his name during the surgery under the effect of sedation!

Surgery went very well with doctor showing me on camera the injury and explaining me the process of acl reconstruction to cater my curiosity.. 

any procedure is guaged by its after effect.. i had little pain once anesthesia went down, and i remember taking very few doses of painkiller thereafter.. 16 th day into surgery i got my stitches removed today (dr. rudraprasad removed it himself! generally doctors ask nurses to do it.. this shows doctors' concern towards his patients).. 

ill tell you all readers that there is no pain without painkillers and im quickly on my road to recovery! I would like to conclude by this parting statement which is fixed in my brain now

Orthopedics = Dr. Rudraprasad

PS:  there is one problem when u got to meet the doctor. u need to be prepared to wait for long unless u got an appointment. since patient rush is huge for him",2021-02-06 13:56:51,False,True,Dhanush,,,
