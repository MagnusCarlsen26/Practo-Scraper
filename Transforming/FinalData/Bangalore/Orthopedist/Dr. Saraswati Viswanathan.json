The day we still remember by last year our 9 years old daughter had a severe injury which ended up with hip bone fractured. That was a pandemic 1st stage so initially we took her to some ortho doc who dint diagnosed properly din even mind to take physical examination for her and sent us back to home saying nothing to worry. We faced the challenged part of our life for about a week. She couldn't able to walk and tolerating the pain. Then we realised we have to get second opinion. And we took her to Doc Anil. As soon as he saw the child he took x ray and clearly explained she needs emergency surgery and recoemmded doc Saraswathy to us. That was the moment we were totally collapsed and not able to come out of that shock. Then we gotta met her next day for surgery. All the process were done so fast actually. Timely intervention, the way the doctor clearly explain us about the risk factors, her empathy towards our daughter, dedication work the surgery was successful and she was the one who keeps following us for regular checkups. The best part is even our child is too attached with her. More than a doc n patient we could feel the motherly bonding between doc and our daughter. Totally we felt we were in safe hands and whatever she advised worked very well for our child and she started walking. Even recent days we had done implant exit also as per her advice. And she is doing good n we feel our daughter had got a new life. All because of her efforts, passionate towards her profession. Wish u all the best doc. I strongly recommend doc Saraswathy to all those who are in needy.\n\n",

Both her hips were dislocated at birth and she underwent 3 surgeries between the age of 2 months to 1.5 years, from another renowned hospital. Right hip got clinically reduced but left hip was still dislocated. From past three years, we consulted multiple doctors to find the best treatment plan and got to know about Dr. Saraswati. She was very appealing on our first meeting and most importantly my daughter felt very comfortable with her. So we got our daughter operated under the supervision of Dr. Saraswati at Sparsh Hospital, Infantry Road on 31st October 2022. I am really thankful to Dr. Saraswati and also the Hospital Staff for giving the best care to my daughter. I am also grateful to God and Dr. Harshini in getting to know about Dr. Saraswati (a very friendly doctor) at the right time.",

The day we still remember by last year our 9 years old daughter had a severe injury which ended up with hip bone fractured. That was a pandemic 1st stage so initially we took her to some ortho doc who dint diagnosed properly din even mind to take physical examination for her and sent us back to home saying nothing to worry. We faced the challenged part of our life for about a week. She couldn't able to walk and tolerating the pain. Then we realised we have to get second opinion. And we took her to Doc Anil. As soon as he saw the child he took x ray and clearly explained she needs emergency surgery and recoemmded doc Saraswathy to us. That was the moment we were totally collapsed and not able to come out of that shock. Then we gotta met her next day for surgery. All the process were done so fast actually. Timely intervention, the way the doctor clearly explain us about the risk factors, her empathy towards our daughter, dedication work the surgery was successful and she was the one who keeps following us for regular checkups. The best part is even our child is too attached with her. More than a doc n patient we could feel the motherly bonding between doc and our daughter. Totally we felt we were in safe hands and whatever she advised worked very well for our child and she started walking. Even recent days we had done implant exit also as per her advice. And she is doing good n we feel our daughter had got a new life. All because of her efforts, passionate towards her profession. Wish u all the best doc. I strongly recommend doc Saraswathy to all those who are in needy.\n\n",

Both her hips were dislocated at birth and she underwent 3 surgeries between the age of 2 months to 1.5 years, from another renowned hospital. Right hip got clinically reduced but left hip was still dislocated. From past three years, we consulted multiple doctors to find the best treatment plan and got to know about Dr. Saraswati. She was very appealing on our first meeting and most importantly my daughter felt very comfortable with her. So we got our daughter operated under the supervision of Dr. Saraswati at Sparsh Hospital, Infantry Road on 31st October 2022. I am really thankful to Dr. Saraswati and also the Hospital Staff for giving the best care to my daughter. I am also grateful to God and Dr. Harshini in getting to know about Dr. Saraswati (a very friendly doctor) at the right time.",
