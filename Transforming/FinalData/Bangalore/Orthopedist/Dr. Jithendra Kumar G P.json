My knee was highly unstable then, very difficult to walk.\n\nGot my ACL reconstructed by him , followed by 10 days of Physiotherapy & 2 more follow up consultation. Got back to sports in about 8 months and now it is 8 years over, still active with games-surgically fixed knee is stable. \n\nI highly recommend him for joint related issues. He is transparent on what he can and which is beyond his specialized skill sets.\n\n\n ",
