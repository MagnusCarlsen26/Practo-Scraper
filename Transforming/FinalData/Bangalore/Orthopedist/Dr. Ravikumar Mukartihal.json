He explained everything to me in a very clear manner. He was also very kind and friendly. Due to his great expertise and experience in Robotic knee surgery and looking to his mighty confidence in me I got ready for bilateral Total knee replacement on 23rdJuly 2022. During my hospital stay he was so cooperative and helping nature attitude. Resultantly I am able to recover so fast even within 12days of surgery I am able to walk without any Walker/stick or any support.At the time of stitch removal On 14thday I entered into hospital on foot even without any support. All hospital staff surprised to see my fast recovery. All credit goes to Dr Ravi who always inspired me with smiling face during stay in hospital and showed great confidence in me that I would recover very fast.Even after discharge from hospital he is kind enough to reply my each and every WhatsApp messages so quickly with building up a great satisfaction of my all querry.\nDr. Ravi is incredible. Not only has he taken great care of my health, but also he is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. Hence I came all the way from Jaipur Rajasthan to Bengalore for TKR at very reasonable cost .I highly recommend becoming his patient!\n\nGreat medical office, wonderful and warm experience from start to finish. Appreciate Dr.Ravi taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options.\n\nWonderful experience with Sparsh hospital Bengalore where Dr. Ravi is a wonderful surgeon, and the staff was always helpful and kind. They ensured I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up. I am so glad and lucky that I chosen Dr Ravi for TKR and would highly recommend to anyone. I started to walk daily on an average 4 to 5km with out any problem within two months of TKR. Once you meet personally you started to love him as a great Doctor at the same time wonderful cooperative human being.\nI highly recommend Dr RaviKumar Murkatihal, Bengalore for TKR and even for any ortho problem also.\nNathmal Jain,\nRajasthan\n(Retd AGM, SBI)\n\n.",

Although we had taken multiple opinions on what should be the best solution, it was a blessing to have met Dr.Ravi Kumar as he gave us the best advise and did not push us to take a decision in a hurry. The best quality doctor was that he also took an opinion from his senior doctor Dr.Sharan Patil to give us the confidence on the procedures planned. He also performed the surgery and shared the up to date updates on my father's condition. Very happy with his service.",

He explained everything to me in a very clear manner. He was also very kind and friendly. Due to his great expertise and experience in Robotic knee surgery and looking to his mighty confidence in me I got ready for bilateral Total knee replacement on 23rdJuly 2022. During my hospital stay he was so cooperative and helping nature attitude. Resultantly I am able to recover so fast even within 12days of surgery I am able to walk without any Walker/stick or any support.At the time of stitch removal On 14thday I entered into hospital on foot even without any support. All hospital staff surprised to see my fast recovery. All credit goes to Dr Ravi who always inspired me with smiling face during stay in hospital and showed great confidence in me that I would recover very fast.Even after discharge from hospital he is kind enough to reply my each and every WhatsApp messages so quickly with building up a great satisfaction of my all querry.\nDr. Ravi is incredible. Not only has he taken great care of my health, but also he is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. Hence I came all the way from Jaipur Rajasthan to Bengalore for TKR at very reasonable cost .I highly recommend becoming his patient!\n\nGreat medical office, wonderful and warm experience from start to finish. Appreciate Dr.Ravi taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options.\n\nWonderful experience with Sparsh hospital Bengalore where Dr. Ravi is a wonderful surgeon, and the staff was always helpful and kind. They ensured I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up. I am so glad and lucky that I chosen Dr Ravi for TKR and would highly recommend to anyone. I started to walk daily on an average 4 to 5km with out any problem within two months of TKR. Once you meet personally you started to love him as a great Doctor at the same time wonderful cooperative human being.\nI highly recommend Dr RaviKumar Murkatihal, Bengalore for TKR and even for any ortho problem also.\nNathmal Jain,\nRajasthan\n(Retd AGM, SBI)\n\n.",

The best quality doctor was that he also took an opinion from his senior doctor Dr.Sharan Patil to give us the confidence on the procedures planned. He also performed the surgery and shared the up to date updates on my father's condition. Very happy with his service.",
