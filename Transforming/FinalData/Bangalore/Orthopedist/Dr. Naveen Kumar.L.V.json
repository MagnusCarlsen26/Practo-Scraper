Else I would be suffering from early arthrities. for second opinion, we went to another multi speciality hospital. The second doctor told not to go for meniscus replacement as it is done in very rare cases. but he suggested to have both meniscus repair and ACL Reconstruction.  Both the doctors had said that the cost would be around 4 to 5 lakhs. we were too scared and visited Dr. Naveen Kumar at sports orthopedic clinic based on . Just by talking to him all our tensions and fears were gone. he is a gem of doctor and rearest to find.He explained the problem by showing the pictorial representation so I knew what my issue is. he spent around 60 minutes to explain what my issue is. by physical examination , he ruled out all the unnecessary surgeries suggested by other doctors, eventhough we were asking. While operating also, he examined  the knee and confirmed that ACL reconstruction is not required. In today's world,where most of the doctors suggesting unnecessary extra surgeries even though it is not all required for the sake of money based on my consultations with the most reputed doctors in big corporate hospitals in Bangalore, Dr.Naveen is the doctor who never ever suggests unnecessary surgeries.Even after the surgery he regularly followups with patients. He is available on phone call and WhatsApp. it's been 4 weeks and I am able to walk without any support. He is a gem of doctor who is patient friendly anybody can trust him blindly..",

While the reviews here has already set pretty high expectations for me, my experience with him in person exceeded even those. Coming to the actual consultation, what I liked the most about him was that he was extremely patient in answering all my queries. Even though I had already decided that I should go ahead with the surgery (based on the MRI scan report and my research), he made sure I understood the pros and cons of going ahead with the surgery. The appointment is normally only for 15 mins, but he spent a good 45 mins with me  (thankfully there was no patient waiting at that time). Despite this long first appointment, he did not charge me for the follow up appointment even though I visited again after 8 days (his policy states that 2nd consultation is free until 7 days). Coming to the surgery, I strongly doubt if I could've had any better outcome. Based on my MRI scan, it seemed extremely unlikely that he would be able to save my Meniscus, but Dr.Naveen managed to save it as soon as he saw the opportunity during the surgery. It has been just 18 days since my surgery and I'm already able to walk fairly comfortably (with a slight limp which I'm sure will go away soon). The knee seems to be quite stable too.Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better surgeon and consultant for my knee issues.

Else I would be suffering from early arthrities. for second opinion, we went to another multi speciality hospital. The second doctor told not to go for meniscus replacement as it is done in very rare cases. but he suggested to have both meniscus repair and ACL Reconstruction.  Both the doctors had said that the cost would be around 4 to 5 lakhs. we were too scared and visited Dr. Naveen Kumar at sports orthopedic clinic based on . Just by talking to him all our tensions and fears were gone. he is a gem of doctor and rearest to find.He explained the problem by showing the pictorial representation so I knew what my issue is. he spent around 60 minutes to explain what my issue is. by physical examination , he ruled out all the unnecessary surgeries suggested by other doctors, eventhough we were asking. While operating also, he examined  the knee and confirmed that ACL reconstruction is not required. In today's world,where most of the doctors suggesting unnecessary extra surgeries even though it is not all required for the sake of money based on my consultations with the most reputed doctors in big corporate hospitals in Bangalore, Dr.Naveen is the doctor who never ever suggests unnecessary surgeries.Even after the surgery he regularly followups with patients. He is available on phone call and WhatsApp. it's been 4 weeks and I am able to walk without any support. He is a gem of doctor who is patient friendly anybody can trust him blindly..",

While the reviews here has already set pretty high expectations for me, my experience with him in person exceeded even those. Coming to the actual consultation, what I liked the most about him was that he was extremely patient in answering all my queries. Even though I had already decided that I should go ahead with the surgery (based on the MRI scan report and my research), he made sure I understood the pros and cons of going ahead with the surgery. The appointment is normally only for 15 mins, but he spent a good 45 mins with me  (thankfully there was no patient waiting at that time). Despite this long first appointment, he did not charge me for the follow up appointment even though I visited again after 8 days (his policy states that 2nd consultation is free until 7 days). Coming to the surgery, I strongly doubt if I could've had any better outcome. Based on my MRI scan, it seemed extremely unlikely that he would be able to save my Meniscus, but Dr.Naveen managed to save it as soon as he saw the opportunity during the surgery. It has been just 18 days since my surgery and I'm already able to walk fairly comfortably (with a slight limp which I'm sure will go away soon). The knee seems to be quite stable too.Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better surgeon and consultant for my knee issues. I would strongly recommend him to anyone considering ACL Reconstruction or Meniscectomy.",

                "reply_text": "Thanks for the review! Firstly, we need to note that the patient had advanced arthritis of the ankle.  This was clearly explained. At her age, with other medical problems, we did not want to suggest an ankle replacement surgery for her. Pain medications are not a long term solutions for this. As the patient had stiffness of the smaller joints of the foot as well, it was recommended that she does some simple stretches to keep the foot muscles supple. These are generic exercises and do suit for all age groups. It was clearly explained to the patient and family that these exercises will take 4 to 6 weeks of regularity before one can expect improvement. As the family had concerns, I had personally phoned them and discussed these issues. Inspite of that, when people expect long standing issues to get better within 10 days or 3 weeks, I am at loss for words. Fortunately, vast majority of our patients are not looking for a list of medications to be prescribed, but are ready to do the exercises for long enough period. For people who struggle to do the exercises themselves, there is always an option of taking help from physiotherapists, but that would mean one needs to be ready to shell out 15 to 20K for physio sessions. \nWe do understand that people come to us with lot of hope. But patients need to understand that there is a difference between a sorcerer (Baba) and a Doctor and need the patience to go through the treatment and return back to clinic for review when necessary.\nLastly, yes we do have generic list of exercises for a lot of orthopedic conditions. Sometimes, the same list of exercises may be applicable to two different conditions. They work for most patients provided they stick to it!\nBest wishes\n-Dr Naveen",

They are just forwarding a set of exercises to everyone irrespective of age and severity, whether they are 75 years old or 30 years old!!! My mother did the exercises for 2 days and her swelling and pain increased, she got swelling at the back of the ankle also, ******* *** *** **** ** *** ***** *** ***** **** ******** ** *** ***** ***** For myself, I continued doing the exercises exactly in the way they had told, but after 10 days or so, I also developed pain at the back of the ankle, and the heel pain is still there.  I had come here with lot of hope after looking at doctor's qualification and reading the reviews, in fact waited for 3,4 days to show him only since he was out of station, but it was of no use.  Looks like they are interested only in problems related to bones, for pains they are just handing over exercises and sending away.",

During my X-ray time she use to ensure that I am comfortable and always carrying smile in her face.  She is such a nice lady. Now coming to doctor,the time you will enter his room you will be greeted with his smile and a warm welcome, he is a kind of gem which our society needs. From the starting of my procedure for fracture and dislocation he explained everything to us in detail and solved all our queries, He was transparent and there was nothing he has hidden from us throughout the treatment. Since after my POP was removed the lockdown was there, so whatever doctor suggested exercises I followed those. And in 3 months, my hand became normal and i started all my daily activities. It\u2019s been one year I am following up with the doctor and his advices. I can do all kinds of exercises, play all kinds of sports and there is nothing I can\u2019t do now. And my wrist is now as strong as it was. So whatever bone problem you have blindly go to him and leave everything on him. Follow his advices and you will come back to your normal life again. \n** ** ****** ******* ** *** *** ********* *** *********** ********** *** ********** \nThe society needs many more like you doctor. \nThank you so much!!",

He had observed my knee bruises and swelling, diagnosed accurately and suggested a X-ray for both knees. As it was evident from X-ray that there was no fracture, he had provided me medication, knee cap and had advised to take complete rest for a week. \n\nFurthermore, in the next consultation, he examined my leg movements and diagnosed that my right knee wasn\u2019t improving as much as the left knee. My MRI of the right knee indicated insertional tendinosis involving distal quadriceps tendon, which Dr. Naveen is treating me perfectly with the equipment I need such as ROM knee brace, abundant rest and simple exercises.\n\nI have complete faith in Dr. Naveen that I will get better soon with time and the treatment path he provides. I have no words to describe a perfectionist like him and my gratitude towards him. The world needs you sir!",

He has practised for years in UK and performed thousands of surgeries over there and now practising in Bangalore, so you can get quality consultation with reasonable prices in India. Surgery is always a scary word, as a small mistake by surgeon can ruin our body. However, Dr. Naveen does surgeries almost everyday, so anyone can believe on his hands expertise. He always welcome his patients with cute smile, which all will like. I visited him some 5 months back for ACL tear and he explained the problem in detail with plus and minus both. He is a tech savvy doctor and explains issues first using animations of human bones and muscles over TV screens in his clinic, that gives confidence to anyone. He gives less medicines and provides you physiotherapy/exercises to keep your body healthy and for fast recovery. After discussing with him, I went for ACL reconstruction surgery over Apollo Hospitals and post surgery on 9th day, I was able to walk slowly-2 without any support. After 4 weeks of surgery, I was able to return to my workplace. He has treated my wife also for muscles and nerves pain related problems and she is also doing well now.He is our family doctor now. I'll highly recommend him for any bones and muscles related problems consultation.",

I am totally convinced with his expertise advice and last week went for ACL reconstruction surgery with him. \n\nDr Naveen Kumar's friendliness and gentle nature, my whole family became fan of him.\n\nHe will give confidence and supports human values.\nToday is first week after the surgery, now I gained much more confidence and could able to walk independently and perform regular activities normally.  Dr Naveen has advised me physiotherapy protocol, currently I am practicing those exercises. \n\nAfter few months(3-6 months) I will try to share my experience and situation again. Hoping, my ACL reconstruction surgery went well and I will back to sports activities within few months from now. \n\nBased on my personal experience with Dr Naveen, I will strongly recommend him for his humanity nature and his surgical expertise. \n\nThank you Dr Naveen.\n",

Her knee pain had become so unbearable that she could barely walk. Initially, she was hesitant to undergo surgery due to the fear and skepticism surrounding it. However, after much persuasion, we finally convinced her to see Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V.\n\nBefore the surgery, I had consulted with a few knee specialists and orthopedics in Bangalore based on Google and Practo reviews. However, my experience with them was quite disappointing. They seemed more focused on promoting their services rather than advising us on the best course of action. It was only after meeting with Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. that we felt reassured.\n\nDr. Naveen Kumar L.V. was very patient and understanding. He listened to our concerns and suggested the best options available for my mother's condition. He did not rush us into making a decision, but instead gave us a week to think it over. He even spoke to my mother personally, explaining the procedure and reassuring her that everything would be alright. His kindness and compassion towards his patients are truly admirable.\n\nThe surgery was a success, but the road to recovery was not easy. My mother was in a lot of pain for the first week. However, Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. made sure to visit her every day and help her with simple exercises. He was very attentive and reassuring, which made all the difference. Two months after the surgery, my mother is now able to walk comfortably without a stick. We are all delighted to see her progress and feel grateful to Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. for making it possible.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. is not just a brilliant doctor, but also a kind and compassionate human being who deeply cares about his patients. His professionalism, expertise, and kindness have left a lasting impression on me and my family. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a trustworthy and reliable orthopedic surgeon. Thank you, Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V., for everything you have done for my mother and our family. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.",

The young girl who performs the X-ray is one of the kindest staffs in the clinic, who had made my mom very comfortable in the process because of her immense pain while bending or stretching the knee.\nFurthermore, Doctor had examined the X-ray and provided a detailed summary of the report that the X-ray doesn't potray a serious injury or a fracture. Hence, a step-by-step diagnosis, medication and treatment path was provided to my mom along with the exercise leaflets, which are self-explanatory. At present, my mom's knee pain has decreased to a greater extent.\n\nAlso, last year my mom had visited Dr. Naveen since she had excruciating pain in her left hand near the thumb, which had lasted for almost 2 months. During the consultation, doctor closely observed and accurately diagnosed this condition as De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Consequently, my mom had decided to take the injection as suggested by the doctor, which was extremely painful momentarily. However, within few days, her condition and pain had reduced evidently and she followed the treatment path, exercises provided by the doctor. Over the next few weeks, the pain had completely subsided. Thanks to Dr. Naveen for everything so far and kudos to his excellence, precision, presence of mind and so on. God bless!\n\nPS: The clinic premises are hygienic and the staffs are amicable and approachable.",

I got reference of  Dr. Naveen from my friend and visited in April. Dr. Naveen was first doctor who did not insist to undergo surgery for my issue based on my reports. I would specially highlight the systematic approach of doctor where he treated first the issue of radiating pain in my leg and than muscle stiffness issue. He prescribed only medicines which were actually necessary. Today I have recovered 60-70% mainly because of exercises suggested by doctor than medicine.",

In my very first visit in May 2022, I was pleasantly surprised that he diagnosed the problem in my knee just by clinical examination, without referring to my MRI Scan. He thoroughly explained me the treatment and estimated timeline of recovery. It assisted me in making up my mind for surgery. \n\nOn the operation table, he made me absolutely comfortable and the surgery was totally successful. \nPost-surgery consultations have enhanced my confidence and I'm gradually recovering. \n\nDr. Naveen is a kind human as well, very friendly, gave sufficient time to me and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.

He answered all my queries and addressed my concerns and did it all with a smile. How I wish more doctors could be like him! Also, staff at the Sports Orthopedic Institute are super organized. From appointment to tests and billing, everything was done efficiently without any delay. The doctor recommended a few exercises to me, which were all documented as PDF and shared with me through WhatsApp on spot. No unnecessary fuss over registration of new patients, paperwork, etc. I've never met a more professional and organized healthcare team so far. Heartfelt thanks to Dr. Naveen and his team!",

I asked about how much more I need to wait, there was no definite answer. At the end they said we will refund. While, I understand the emergency but if slots are given then we should stick to that schedule. I am ok with one reschedule as well but no response later on is a challenge.

So finally after consulting a couple of times, I decided to go for surgery and he motivated and made sure I was not afraid of surgery since it is the first surgery I'm going through.\nStarting from consultation till post-surgery his treatment is very impressive and reliable.\nThe guidance of post-surgery is also excellent.

I consulted him for lower back and hip pain, he diagnosed the issue and explained me the treatment plan/time. I was in distress because my previous consulting doctor told me that it's a disk prolapse and I have to urgently go for a MRI scan. Dr Naveen examined me and well, it was a sprain and Dr Naveen, didn't even mentioned of MRI or anything. I am healing now, he said it will take little time. Thank you sir. God bless him. ",

He recommends natural process to heal as mush as possible and would not straightaway right you 5-10 medicines.

His diagnosis is apt and he doesn't prescribe anything without need. He initially did a physical examination and then suggested to get a MRI, after which suggested a surgery to repair the torn meniscus. He didn't remove the meniscus(which is easier) but repaired it, so that I don't face difficulties later due to less cushioning.He was really helpful before, during and after my surgery, readily available on phone whenever I had doubts. It's been 6 months and I am doing well. Thanks Doctor. :)",

As per report impression I had high grade ACL tear in left knee and meniscus tear also. Doctor Naveen confirmed that there is only ACL tear  but there might be no tear in meniscus after observing the report. After thorough check up he explained the benefits of ACL reconstruction and suggested to go for it. I underwent surgery on Nov 12 th. Surgery was successful and he confirmed again that there is no meniscus injury while doing surgery. He made me to walk on the same day of surgery with the help of walker which gave me the confidence. Recently I had my consultation after 6 weeks post surgery, doctor confirmed that I am doing good and he suggested to go for agility training also. I am happy with my current situation post surgery and thank Doctor Naveen. I wish him a good career in future and a good health. I will recommend doctor Naveen. ",

We were there for 7 days and doctor helped us to get well in 7 days only.. Me and my wife is so happy . Best part he explained us everything and told us the remedy. he was least interested in medicine prescribing. which is rare now a days. He insisted on exercises and physio. And miracle happened. Visit him without fear .. he will surely help you.At last - Thanks Doctor for helping us.",

At this moment I'm still undergoing physiotherapy, I wouldn't be able to say much, however I'll just say that- I liked the way Dr.Naveen welcomes you in and listen to the problem. He explained the issue with the help of pictures on a monitor, which of course is not a new thing but very few doctor bother to explain the issue with the help of pictures, diagrams, models. Honestly I have been to many of them. It's sometimes really helpful if a doctor takes a few minutes extra and explain the problem. He didn't ask for any unnecessary test for the moment and explained the reason for that. I would strongly recommend him. Hope he keeps listening to patient patiently in future as well. Thanks.",

I actually felt better just by his humble behaviour and the way he explained my issue. Did not insist on any tests and only 'suggested' not imposed a surgery. He was on time for the surgery at 630am and completed as promised. I was able to walk the same day. If you are looking for a person who treats you like a friend with utmost respect, look no further.\n\nI think I would go to see him even without any reason!",

Sincerest thanks to Dr Naveen.  He has even shared some googled documents, pdfs, exercise materials over email. He is someone who genuinely tries to solve the problem at its aptest way. When I have left from my appointment, i folded my hands and conveyed my NAMASKARAM, that much I was impressed with the way he clarified my issue. He is highly educated in the ortho area, so many certifications and awards that he has got would really prove Vaidyo Narayano Hari...\n\nThank you very much Dr Naveen.",

After examining my reports, he explained me about ACL surgery in detail and also identified a meniscal tear which had to be repaired, which was unseen by other doctors. He explained me the issue and surgery process in detail. He motivated me through out, during the surgery as well as post surgery. He always made me take an extra mile because of which my recovery was faster and smoother. He is very patient while listening to the problem and explains the problem in detail.His energy and dedication towards the patients is adorable. Thanks a lot Dr.Naveen for all the support, guidance during my recovery process. I would definitely recommend him for any kind of ortho problem.",

He was very thorough. he went through my MRI negatives in detail and explained in layman terms of opting for surgery and as well as not opting for surgery. the way he explained made me opt for surgery considering the long term benefits. The crucial difference for me is the prehab exercises. I blindly followed. now post surgery I could walk without support in exactly 5 days after the surgery. Thanks doctor for being wonderful and thorough with the diagnosis and the precision surgery. Highly recommended Ortho doctor with a fair bit of humane touch in Bangalore. ",

Went for consultation with City's 2 big hospital's & Ortho Surgeons.With the MRI report they have suggested me the ACL reconstruction as there is complete ACL tear. Still i was not convinced, hence when i was exploring Practo, i got to know about Dr. Naveen. Thanks Practo!. When i met Dr. Naveen, me and my family were so much impressed they way he spent time and explained about the injury. BTW he didn't compel for the surgery.All the queries and doubts were clarified by Dr. Naveen very politely and friendly manner.  Fortunate that we have Doctors like Naveen in the city who are not just money orientd. He is the person with ethics and good principles.He is the one gives much importance to every patients. Without any hesitation I fixed the surgery date and the surgery went very well. Doctor took much care and spent the time with me during pre-surgery and post surgery(even inside the ICU). This gave me confidence level high, i was discharged the next day itself. Under Dr's advice am recovering fast.Now i am undergoing Physio and there is early recovery that i could anticipate. I always owe big thanks to Dr.Naveen sir, ** ** *** **** ****** * ***** **** i could strongly recommend to other people.People can visit Dr's Clinic at Koramangala , you will feel the treatment closer to your heart.",

Dr Naveen after examining my MRI report, explained me the injury and procedure to treat the same. i was advised for a artroscopy surgery for both ACL and meniscus Reconstruction. I was really scared of surgery n took my own sweet time to prepare mentally for the surgery. I underwent the surgery on 7 April at Manipal Sarjapur Road. Dr Naveen treated me on the same and it was a day care surgery. It was a painless one as promised by the doctor. Now I am currently in the recovery phase and i am recovering well with the physio therapy methods suggested by doc. Overall he has a great team of surgeons who will help you throughout the recovery phase.. Thanks to the whole team and I would definitely recommend DR Naveen to my family and friend..",

Doctor doesn't create a panic and explains the problem in detail and clearly let's the patient understand the options and consequences of the treatment if any. Also, doctor always responds to call or message responsibly. Would highly recommend Dr.Naveen. It is always better to invest on consultation fees to a good dr. rather than ending up with partial treatments with multiple doctors.",

When running full clinics every day, it is humanly impossible for me to attend to telephone calls. I wish there were more than 24 hours in a day! \nInspite of this, I have spoken to you once on phone already 4 days post first consultation. When you expected second phone call 8 days later, you were offered a free follow-up appointment. As you didn't want to opt for it, you were told to drop the mail. Infact, you received a prompt answer to that mail as well. Moreover, regarding your medical condition, we had a clear discussion that it will take atleast 4 weeks of exercises, and was not going to resolve within in a week. I can definitely make the promise to meet my patient\u2019s needs, but not always meet their expectations! \nBest wishes \n- Dr Naveen",

After getting the MRI done, I found out that a part of the labrum had completely been torn off and surgery was the only option to fix it. That is when on my search for doctors for my surgery I met Dr. Naveen. He was suggested to us by a friend. After meeting the doctor, I had no second thoughts that he is the doctor I want to get my surgery done from. He has a very positive attitude and helped me understand my shoulder condition and what procedure he would do in the surgery,  the recovery time and finally getting back to sports. It has been 3 months my surgery was done, I have gained my range of movements and now am working on strengthening of the shoulder as suggested by the doctor during follow-ups. I am pretty happy with my progress of recovery as is the doctor.",

In some it just pulls the end of the tendon away from the bone and in others, a chunk of bone gets pulled out with the tendon. In both of these injuries, the treatment remains the same, which is splinting them. I avoid unnecessary xrays, as the treatment is same for both conditions. Secondly finger cot splint given to you covers the whole finger and is the only option we have over here. I hope that you are still being treated with the splint till it heals and not some \u201cmajor surgery for the major fracture\u201d! And,  thanks for the strong recommendation! \nBest wishes\n- Dr Naveen",

We have not seen you further to that. \nFortunately, 95% of all the patients I see, are keen to understand the problem and do the exercises, rather than just taking medications.
