On March 14th 2021, I reached home, after running 10K in the nearby ground and started plucking flowers. I fell from the wall and fractured right leg near ankle (shattered my calcaneus bone). We visited almost each and every orthopedic surgeon\u2019s office in my home town. Each one of those doctors said, \u201cWe can\u2019t do surgery but they can put hard cast (plaster of Paris) around the fractured leg and it will heel on itself\u201d. They also said, \u201cGetting back to normal walking style is difficult and you won\u2019t be able to run again\u201d. These words (won\u2019t be able to run again) hurt me more than the physical pain from fracture. It was like Sun setting in the West and never rising in the East. Felt like, my life turned upside down forever. \nWe (me and my husband, also a marathon runner) explored all the options and called each and every doctor we knew personally. My cousin (a Gynecologist) and her husband (also a Doctor) posted about my case in almost every Doctor\u2019s group they knew. Most of the Doctors in those groups referred Dr. Darshan Kumar as the best Orthopedic surgeon to consult. \nBased on my cousin\u2019s reference, I consulted Dr. Darshan Kumar. He assured me saying \u201cThis is a very complicated fracture, don\u2019t worry I handled much more complicated ones and be positive\u201d. Doctor performed the surgery in a very deliberate manner for couple of hours. As soon as operation is done, doctor told my husband, \"You want her to run again, don\u2019t worry we will make her run again\".\nDr. Darshan Kumar is a terrific, ************** sensitive, confident, caring, informative provider that I have complete faith and trust in. I trusted him so much that I didn\u2019t consult physiotherapy doctor during my recovery and simply followed his suggestions. He is great with his patients and he gives you all the time you need during an office visit and makes sure all of your concerns and questions are addressed. He truly cares about his patients. Dr. Darshan sir combines expertise and a willingness to listen and discuss. He\u2019s very empathetic and listens to our concerns. He takes time with the patient to help them with their issues. \nHe has been with us at every stage of the recovery and am very thankful for his excellent diagnosis and a pitch perfect operation. Really efficient, on point, respectful and great personality. Hands-down the most effective and efficient doctor visits I\u2019ve had.\nThrough his staff, we came to know Vajubhai Vala, the then Governor of Karnataka was treated by Dr. Darshan Kumar when the Governor fractured his finger in Raj Bhavan Garden. Some foreigners visit him regularly. Some athletes (His name is Subhash) were able to compete at national level after successful surgeries by Dr. Darshan Kumar. \nOn a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most severe damage) my fracture is rated 10 by all doctors. Where ever I am in the future, I will be very grateful to the doctor, because of him, I am able to walk normally and run normally. I am posting this review on the first day I am able to run again. I am indebted to Dr. Darshan for making me run again and for helping me to lead a normal life again. \nDr. Darshan Kumar is well known for his skills, compassion, empathetic, commitment and very well updated with his excellence in Orthopedics, so I recommend Dr. Darshan Kumar in a heartbeat to anyone looking for ***** Orthopedic Surgeon\u201d.\n",

Always the first impression will be either the Best or worse, likewise, we had a very best impression by Dr.Darshan Jain in our first visit. \n\nDr.Darshan Jain is an Compassionate, Humble and Explanative on the problem and procedure and even he promised us that both the hands will be operated with 100% confidence of normal functioning of all affected figures post surgery whereas grafting may required for one hand which is little severe. \n\nFinally, we had surgery for both hands one after another over a period of 1 month time with interval of 15 days from first hand surgery. \n\nAs promised by Dr.Darshan Jain he has completed the surgery and procedure of both the hands successfully with 100% functioning of both hands like earlier and that to be surprisingly without Grafting for severe one also keeping in mind of my Father-In-Law's health condition as he was an heart patient with Diabetic. \n\nI would strongly recommend all the needy person who are seeking Orthopedic Surgery/Orthopedic Treatment/Advice on Ortho related issues to visit Dr.Darshan Jain at least once for better treatment and solutions; he is the best Orthopedic Surgeon ever I seen, as I had met more than 15 Orthopedic Surgeons in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shimoga and Manipal over a period of 2 years and we never had confidence of re-functioning of affected figures by any of the Orthopedic Surgeons whom we met except Dr.Darshan Jain and even my Father-In-Law is doing normal farming work post surgery whereas earlier he could not mix the food while eating, hold the pen to write etc... \n\nOnce again I reiterate, meet Dr.Darshan Jain at least once and get rid of your Orthopedic problems. \n\nRegards, \nJayaram Gowda. \nBirur, Chickmagaluru Dist.\n",

Dr. Darshan treated both, me (for carpal tunnel syndrome) and my wife (for tennis elbow and knee pain). We both have come out of these problems long back, because of the very effective treatment given. \n\nMy wife was fully out of the tennis elbow problem (in less than a month's time) which had persisted for a long time. \n\nI am also 100% alright with no sign of the Carpal tunnel syndrome today. A quick background: I used to work using my mobile phone, for more than 7 to 8 hours per day (which went on for months together). This lead to Carpal tunnel syndrome (right hand), which was rightly diagnosed by Dr. Darshan. The severity was as such wherein, I couldn't literally fold my right hand fingers. However, I underwent the surgery as advised by Dr. Darshan in the timeframe suggested. Surgery was indeed successful and in less than a week's time my fingers became flexible. While the recovery period was just around 2 weeks, Dr. Darshan suggested few do's and don'ts, that I followed religiously. My right hand showed great pace of recovery, but my other hand already had similar symptoms but not to the extent of severity in the hand that got operated.. Dr. Darshan then advised to give some time for my other hand (left hand), to analyse rightly if a surgery is required for that hand as well... As time passed (many months, with Dr. Darshan's supervision), the pain in my other hand subsided fully, while the hand that got operated was also perfectly fine. Special thanks to Dr. Darshan for giving me back my life (hand). \n\nDr. Darshan is down to earth and is a Godly human being. He does his job as a service *** *** ** **** ***** **** **** *** ******* ******** **** ****** One should have trust in him and follow his instructions, to see the best results - which I did very religiously and got the best results with just one hand being operated and the other getting healed without an operation. Today, I can lift buckets of water in both the hand and all the credit goes to Dr. Darshan. Thank you Doctor... While the Technology has got so advanced, it also has disastrous effects on people mostly, who get addicted to mobile phones and computers. Such people land up in hospitals... Am sharing my experience in the form of this review, to help such people to get routed to you Dr. Darshan. Thanks once again.",

Within few minutes I was admitted to MS Ramaiah hospital. I was immediately attended by Orthopedic and vascular team who were available at that time.e. My hand was in a very very bad condition. Team was discussing to amputee my hand since it was badly affected. My parents were in deep pain after listening by health condition. Then came Dr Darshan Kumar Jain who analyzed my hand condition and denied amputation. He gave hope and confidense to my parents that hand can be saved and it can function normally. I was operated for almost 4 hrs. Day by day my hand started responding. My muscle was also crushed and there was a very big wound near my elbow joint. Initially my fingers movement started. Skin grafting was done by Dr Darshan which helped me to heal the wound. Dr Darshan gave me self confidence during his everyday visit. My confidense level was improving when ever I was speaking with him. He was explaining all my queries though he was too busy. Now it's almost 4 months from my injury. My hand movements improved a lot. I am able to lift more than 5 kilos now from my injured hand, able to move my wrist and elbow. Dr Darshan came in the form of God in my life who saved my hand. Can't just imagine my life without a hand if it was amputed. Me and my family would like to thank him for his service to his profession who is treating patients like me. ",

As they say if your doctor is having a smile on his face always and talks to you in a comforting tone be friendly with you and not scare you, half of your troubles are gone then and there itself, rest have faith in him and you will be fine . Just be as you are Doctor Darshan never do change, had a very positive experience with you. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a ",

Later was operated for the fracture by the wrist arthroscopy procedure. Very happy about post surgery experience . The surgery was done so  perfect , no one can notice that I had got a surgery done on my hand. Easy to talk to him and he always responds himself instantly via phone call and WhatsApp message. Now it is almost two months after surgery and now hands are all good and fully healed. So satisfied with the surgery done by the best hand surgeon . **** *** **** **** ** ** *** ** *** **** **** ******* *** **** ** ********** * *** ****** *** **** ** ** *** **** **** ******** Surely will recommend  Dr  Darshan sir to anyone and I am sure that everyone will be satisfied with his work as doctor and also will love him as a person \n",

On March 14th 2021, I reached home, after running 10K in the nearby ground and started plucking flowers. I fell from the wall and fractured right leg near ankle (shattered my calcaneus bone). We visited almost each and every orthopedic surgeon\u2019s office in my home town. Each one of those doctors said, \u201cWe can\u2019t do surgery but they can put hard cast (plaster of Paris) around the fractured leg and it will heel on itself\u201d. They also said, \u201cGetting back to normal walking style is difficult and you won\u2019t be able to run again\u201d. These words (won\u2019t be able to run again) hurt me more than the physical pain from fracture. It was like Sun setting in the West and never rising in the East. Felt like, my life turned upside down forever. \nWe (me and my husband, also a marathon runner) explored all the options and called each and every doctor we knew personally. My cousin (a Gynecologist) and her husband (also a Doctor) posted about my case in almost every Doctor\u2019s group they knew. Most of the Doctors in those groups referred Dr. Darshan Kumar as the best Orthopedic surgeon to consult. \nBased on my cousin\u2019s reference, I consulted Dr. Darshan Kumar. He assured me saying \u201cThis is a very complicated fracture, don\u2019t worry I handled much more complicated ones and be positive\u201d. Doctor performed the surgery in a very deliberate manner for couple of hours. As soon as operation is done, doctor told my husband, \"You want her to run again, don\u2019t worry we will make her run again\".\nDr. Darshan Kumar is a terrific, ************** sensitive, confident, caring, informative provider that I have complete faith and trust in. I trusted him so much that I didn\u2019t consult physiotherapy doctor during my recovery and simply followed his suggestions. He is great with his patients and he gives you all the time you need during an office visit and makes sure all of your concerns and questions are addressed. He truly cares about his patients. Dr. Darshan sir combines expertise and a willingness to listen and discuss. He\u2019s very empathetic and listens to our concerns. He takes time with the patient to help them with their issues. \nHe has been with us at every stage of the recovery and am very thankful for his excellent diagnosis and a pitch perfect operation. Really efficient, on point, respectful and great personality. Hands-down the most effective and efficient doctor visits I\u2019ve had.\nThrough his staff, we came to know Vajubhai Vala, the then Governor of Karnataka was treated by Dr. Darshan Kumar when the Governor fractured his finger in Raj Bhavan Garden. Some foreigners visit him regularly. Some athletes (His name is Subhash) were able to compete at national level after successful surgeries by Dr. Darshan Kumar. \nOn a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most severe damage) my fracture is rated 10 by all doctors. Where ever I am in the future, I will be very grateful to the doctor, because of him, I am able to walk normally and run normally. I am posting this review on the first day I am able to run again. I am indebted to Dr. Darshan for making me run again and for helping me to lead a normal life again. \nDr. Darshan Kumar is well known for his skills, compassion, empathetic, commitment and very well updated with his excellence in Orthopedics, so I recommend Dr. Darshan Kumar in a heartbeat to anyone looking for ***** Orthopedic Surgeon\u201d.\n",

Always the first impression will be either the Best or worse, likewise, we had a very best impression by Dr.Darshan Jain in our first visit. \n\nDr.Darshan Jain is an Compassionate, Humble and Explanative on the problem and procedure and even he promised us that both the hands will be operated with 100% confidence of normal functioning of all affected figures post surgery whereas grafting may required for one hand which is little severe. \n\nFinally, we had surgery for both hands one after another over a period of 1 month time with interval of 15 days from first hand surgery. \n\nAs promised by Dr.Darshan Jain he has completed the surgery and procedure of both the hands successfully with 100% functioning of both hands like earlier and that to be surprisingly without Grafting for severe one also keeping in mind of my Father-In-Law's health condition as he was an heart patient with Diabetic. \n\nI would strongly recommend all the needy person who are seeking Orthopedic Surgery/Orthopedic Treatment/Advice on Ortho related issues to visit Dr.Darshan Jain at least once for better treatment and solutions; he is the best Orthopedic Surgeon ever I seen, as I had met more than 15 Orthopedic Surgeons in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shimoga and Manipal over a period of 2 years and we never had confidence of re-functioning of affected figures by any of the Orthopedic Surgeons whom we met except Dr.Darshan Jain and even my Father-In-Law is doing normal farming work post surgery whereas earlier he could not mix the food while eating, hold the pen to write etc... \n\nOnce again I reiterate, meet Dr.Darshan Jain at least once and get rid of your Orthopedic problems. \n\nRegards, \nJayaram Gowda. \nBirur, Chickmagaluru Dist.\n",

Dr. Darshan treated both, me (for carpal tunnel syndrome) and my wife (for tennis elbow and knee pain). We both have come out of these problems long back, because of the very effective treatment given. \n\nMy wife was fully out of the tennis elbow problem (in less than a month's time) which had persisted for a long time. \n\nI am also 100% alright with no sign of the Carpal tunnel syndrome today. A quick background: I used to work using my mobile phone, for more than 7 to 8 hours per day (which went on for months together). This lead to Carpal tunnel syndrome (right hand), which was rightly diagnosed by Dr. Darshan. The severity was as such wherein, I couldn't literally fold my right hand fingers. However, I underwent the surgery as advised by Dr. Darshan in the timeframe suggested. Surgery was indeed successful and in less than a week's time my fingers became flexible. While the recovery period was just around 2 weeks, Dr. Darshan suggested few do's and don'ts, that I followed religiously. My right hand showed great pace of recovery, but my other hand already had similar symptoms but not to the extent of severity in the hand that got operated.. Dr. Darshan then advised to give some time for my other hand (left hand), to analyse rightly if a surgery is required for that hand as well... As time passed (many months, with Dr. Darshan's supervision), the pain in my other hand subsided fully, while the hand that got operated was also perfectly fine. Special thanks to Dr. Darshan for giving me back my life (hand). \n\nDr. Darshan is down to earth and is a Godly human being. He does his job as a service *** *** ** **** ***** **** **** *** ******* ******** **** ****** One should have trust in him and follow his instructions, to see the best results - which I did very religiously and got the best results with just one hand being operated and the other getting healed without an operation. Today, I can lift buckets of water in both the hand and all the credit goes to Dr. Darshan. Thank you Doctor... While the Technology has got so advanced, it also has disastrous effects on people mostly, who get addicted to mobile phones and computers. Such people land up in hospitals... Am sharing my experience in the form of this review, to help such people to get routed to you Dr. Darshan. Thanks once again.",

Within few minutes I was admitted to MS Ramaiah hospital. I was immediately attended by Orthopedic and vascular team who were available at that time.e. My hand was in a very very bad condition. Team was discussing to amputee my hand since it was badly affected. My parents were in deep pain after listening by health condition. Then came Dr Darshan Kumar Jain who analyzed my hand condition and denied amputation. He gave hope and confidense to my parents that hand can be saved and it can function normally. I was operated for almost 4 hrs. Day by day my hand started responding. My muscle was also crushed and there was a very big wound near my elbow joint. Initially my fingers movement started. Skin grafting was done by Dr Darshan which helped me to heal the wound. Dr Darshan gave me self confidence during his everyday visit. My confidense level was improving when ever I was speaking with him. He was explaining all my queries though he was too busy. Now it's almost 4 months from my injury. My hand movements improved a lot. I am able to lift more than 5 kilos now from my injured hand, able to move my wrist and elbow. Dr Darshan came in the form of God in my life who saved my hand. Can't just imagine my life without a hand if it was amputed. Me and my family would like to thank him for his service to his profession who is treating patients like me. ",

As they say if your doctor is having a smile on his face always and talks to you in a comforting tone be friendly with you and not scare you, half of your troubles are gone then and there itself, rest have faith in him and you will be fine . Just be as you are Doctor Darshan never do change, had a very positive experience with you. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a ",

Later was operated for the fracture by the wrist arthroscopy procedure. Very happy about post surgery experience . The surgery was done so  perfect , no one can notice that I had got a surgery done on my hand. Easy to talk to him and he always responds himself instantly via phone call and WhatsApp message. Now it is almost two months after surgery and now hands are all good and fully healed. So satisfied with the surgery done by the best hand surgeon . **** *** **** **** ** ** *** ** *** **** **** ******* *** **** ** ********** * *** ****** *** **** ** ** *** **** **** ******** Surely will recommend  Dr  Darshan sir to anyone and I am sure that everyone will be satisfied with his work as doctor and also will love him as a person \n",

It was such an amazing experience for us, as the very first moment we met him, he introduced himself to us, thoroughly examined my dad's injured hand, explained clearly the condition, what has to be done and gave us full confidence to face the surgery. He was keen in listening each and every doubts  we had and guided us about the whole treatment procedure. Moreover, after the surgery, he has insisted on us to come and meet him personally for all the follow-up sessions in order to know the improvement in hand condition and the natural growth expected to happen. Thank you dear Dr. Darshan. ",

Dr. Darshan did a detailed analysis to figure out that apart from Carpel tunnel syndrome, the right hand also has Synovitis which is the root cause for the pain. Within couple of weeks a simple key hole surgery was performed and my mother fully recovered - completely relieved from pain. Thank you Dr. Darshan for your help!",

Dr suggested physiotherapy bcuz of which 75% improvement is there.  The Dr is very simple and he didn't suggest to undergo operation,  but earlier the other Dr we met  had  suggested immediate operation of the compressed nerve.  I am v much grateful \ud83d\ude4f to Dr Darshan Kumar Jain and he is the best Hand surgeon in Bangalore.
