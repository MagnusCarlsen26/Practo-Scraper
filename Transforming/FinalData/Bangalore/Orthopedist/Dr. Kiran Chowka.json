I was suffering from left  knee pain from past one and half years and later my both knees started to pain and from past few months it was sevear pain. So I decided to consult a doctor and searched the net for some doctors, I saw Dr.Kiran chouka reviews were very good so I thought of consulting him. I visited him in Columbia Asia refferel hospital, yeshwanthpur. He examined me and told me that about 60 to 70 percent of my knees are damaged so he told knee replacement surgery is the only option and the best solution for my problem. The surgery was planed after a week and I went through the surgery on 29th October 2021 by Dr.Kiran chouka and It went brilliantly well and you don't belive it I was able to walk within 24 hrs of the surgery with no pain, so I am going for my left knee replacement also which is scheduled on 2nd November 2021.I went through my second surgery ie..the left knee replacement  as scheduled on 2nd November and it also went on very well in fact it got over earlier than the previous one  it did all my knee exercises after afew hours of surgery and I walked the next morning with the support of walker. I have to say I can already feel the difference in my right knee.  It's really a good feeling all thanks to Dr.kiran chouka who's been a wonderfull , encouraging,  supporting and offcourse a wonderfull surgen and a excellent doctor.",

She was very skeptical about the TKR surgery to be done and this is when I took her to Dr Kiran Chouka at **** **** ***** ******* ** ******* ****** The doctor took sufficient amount of time to understand the issue that my mother was facing. He asked her to take some x-rays to check for the latest condition, post which he suggested knee replacement(TKR).\nDr Kiran did not ask to get the surgery done immediately. Instead he gave enough confidence to my mother about the surgery and explained the entire procedure. He also showed some of his patients videos (which included the doctors own mother's post TKR surgery). He assured her that she will be able to complete her Char-dham Religious Trip this year itself and this is when my mother felt confident that she is in safe hands. \nFinally my mother decided to go ahead with the surgery at Apollo Hospital Sheshadripuram where Dr Kiran Chouka is Head of Orthopedic Department. He made sure that everything went smoothly from the time my mother got admitted till the time of discharge. Additionally Dr. Kiran Chouka made some special arrangements to ensure that my mother felt comfortable and the surgery was 100% successful. \nPost surgery my mother was able to walk a few steps on the very next day itself and physiotherapist used to visit twice a day in the Hospital (It is normally once in other hospitals).\nDr Kiran Chouka wanted my mother to walk out of the Hospital on her own right from the beginning and miraculously, with very little support my mother was able to walk out of the hospital on her own.\nGoing an extra mile, he himself also arranged for a very good skilled physiotherapist to come home everyday for 3 weeks (minimum) and I am already looking forward to the day when my mother will walk without any pain.\nDr Kiran is a genius and extremely passionate towards his work. At such a young age he has excelled in the field of Orthopedics and yet is very down to earth. Dr Kiran does not have the urge to surpass others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at any cost.\nI am extremely thankful to Dr Kiran Chouka for everything he has done *** ** ** *** **** ********** ******* * **** *** **** *****  I will definitely vouch for him on any given day.",

The Bicep tendon was ruptured not in the shoulder (proximal which has a 99% occurrence rate) but at the elbow (distal 1% occurrence). So I know it will be difficult to find a surgeon who has done such a surgery. However, when I met Dr Kiran Chouka, just listening to my symptoms, he was able to diagnosis what the problem was and where the tendon has ruptured. \n\nHe explained me the complete procedure of the surgery, how complex it is, and what things he needs to take care of because of my body built and the type of bones that we Indians have in the elbow. He also said surgery is not necessary if I am are not going to perform certain activities in my day-to-day life.\n\nWhat I observed are:\n\n1. He is a very confident person.\n2. He is an artist and wants to perform surgery as an artist. That means he wants the surgery to be perfect with minimal incision. \n3. Similar traditional surgeries will involve higher incision areas, whereas, for me, the incision was very minimal. Such a type of surgery will take a longer time and require a huge amount of patience.\n4. The post-surgery dressing was perfect, with pain vanishing within a day.\n5. After 3 visits (in 1.5 months) the doctor asked me no further visits are necessary unless I have any problem.\n\nI am posting this experience after 2.5 years of surgery because I wanted observe the post-surgery complications. However, there are no complications. I am able to perform each and every activity that I used to perform before. And there are no visible marks on my incision point.\n\nThank you doctor for the treatment.",

Dr. Kiran did not rush into any conclusion, he spents sufficient time (30mins+) with the patients to understand the concern every time we met him.  He could easily empathize with my mother & assured her that he will make her walk independently within 3 weeks of TKR Surgery. \n\nBy God\u2019s grace & healing power through Dr. Kiran my mother is now relieved of her knee pain & is able to walk independently.\n\nGod has indeed blessed you with an ability to comfort patients with your warm attitude. You are a God\u2019s sent angel to our prayers\u2026May God Bless you abundantly while you are on this mission to heal more & more such patients. \n",

After two ACL reconstruction both on my right knee in 2007 & left knee in 2014, I managed to twist my left knee & tore my ACL with complex Meniscus tear again in July 2021, I consulted Dr.Kiran Chouka & with his confidence diagnosis we planned to go ahead with the ACL reconstruction & Meniscus repair, he was very clear to make me understand on the procedure & the entire treatment. We finally went ahead with the surgery on 20th Oct 2021 in Columbia Asia Hebbal & the doctor showed me live surgery procedure to build that confidence mentally to know what he was doing & how it was done so it gave me a boost to know what procedure my knee underwent. I would like to thank the entire team who performed the surgery right from the Anesthesia Specialist Dr.Chandrashekar who played good songs during procedure to Dr.Kiran Chouka's team of doctors - Santosh, Tarun, Devraj & the whole nursing staff who was part of the procedure. With confidence & what next & how to strengthen my both legs with the next physiotherapy sessions, I am signing off to follow the next adventure journey.",

There is a saying that goes like \"If you cant teach it to a six year old, then you dont understand the thing\". Now I am no 6 year old, but the way Dr. Kiran explained the anatomy of the knee and the exact problem that I was facing, I was pretty sure that he knows all about this and my case was in the best hands.\nThe complete process and formalities of the surgery were done without any hassle and I was even shown the live surgery where the Dr. communicated with me and highlighted the issues and steps being taken to resolve them. It was one of a kind experience for me the way this entire surgery was carried out. \nDr. Kiran and his entire team will make you feel at home all the time and is highly recommended for orthopaedic surgeries.",

My son had a fall while cycling and on taking to a nearby hospital was advised he needs to go thru a surgery and plate/screws implants are required. I was lucky to find Dr.Kiran Chouka on time and reached out to him. He was patiently waiting for us in Apollo Hospital around 6.30pm, saw my son's injury and explained us the details of injury/bone breakage and how he would operate on the injury. The next day operation was performed and for our luck Dr Kiran managed to complete the process without any implants and just with a pin which was removed over the next 2 weeks. The best part of the surgery was NO external part in my son's hand which will cause any kind of discomfort as he grows up. Lastly, really appreciate the patience and passion Dr. Kiran has towards treating his patients and special mention about the way he treats kids.. He personally did the dressing of both the PoP and the Green bandage after removal of the pins",

Due to few suggestions given I had taken a chance of visiting an ayurvedic center for the same in which a Puttur Cut was done for my hand and this was continued for the next three months since the incident. However, there was no signs of recovery and my wrist started growing in a wrong position and my bones were crushed inside into pieces and this was known to me after a MRI scanning was done and due to this I had lost hope that I would fight back again as I'm an International Muay Thai Indian player who won  a Silver Medal in World Muay Thai Championship held in Bangkok ,5 Times National gold medalists in India and won various competitions so far. Then one of our family doctor (Dr.Dhamodar) suggested Dr.Kiran Chouka the best orthopedic surgeon in india for my treatment. At first I went with 0% hope but the way I was treated and given a ray of hope was simply amazing which made me get a hope of recovery. I was suggested a surgery had to be done which lasted for 3-4 hours and Dr. Kiran Chouka had taken a huge risk in doing this surgery for me as it was a complicated case. But with his hardwork and our family prayers my hand is recovering at its best and I'm very thankful to Dr. Kiran Chouka for bringing my hand almost to an old form in just one month of surgery dated (19/01/2021).",

I was suffering from left  knee pain from past one and half years and later my both knees started to pain and from past few months it was sevear pain. So I decided to consult a doctor and searched the net for some doctors, I saw Dr.Kiran chouka reviews were very good so I thought of consulting him. I visited him in Columbia Asia refferel hospital, yeshwanthpur. He examined me and told me that about 60 to 70 percent of my knees are damaged so he told knee replacement surgery is the only option and the best solution for my problem. The surgery was planed after a week and I went through the surgery on 29th October 2021 by Dr.Kiran chouka and It went brilliantly well and you don't belive it I was able to walk within 24 hrs of the surgery with no pain, so I am going for my left knee replacement also which is scheduled on 2nd November 2021.I went through my second surgery ie..the left knee replacement  as scheduled on 2nd November and it also went on very well in fact it got over earlier than the previous one  it did all my knee exercises after afew hours of surgery and I walked the next morning with the support of walker. I have to say I can already feel the difference in my right knee.  It's really a good feeling all thanks to Dr.kiran chouka who's been a wonderfull , encouraging,  supporting and offcourse a wonderfull surgen and a excellent doctor.",

She was very skeptical about the TKR surgery to be done and this is when I took her to Dr Kiran Chouka at **** **** ***** ******* ** ******* ****** The doctor took sufficient amount of time to understand the issue that my mother was facing. He asked her to take some x-rays to check for the latest condition, post which he suggested knee replacement(TKR).\nDr Kiran did not ask to get the surgery done immediately. Instead he gave enough confidence to my mother about the surgery and explained the entire procedure. He also showed some of his patients videos (which included the doctors own mother's post TKR surgery). He assured her that she will be able to complete her Char-dham Religious Trip this year itself and this is when my mother felt confident that she is in safe hands. \nFinally my mother decided to go ahead with the surgery at Apollo Hospital Sheshadripuram where Dr Kiran Chouka is Head of Orthopedic Department. He made sure that everything went smoothly from the time my mother got admitted till the time of discharge. Additionally Dr. Kiran Chouka made some special arrangements to ensure that my mother felt comfortable and the surgery was 100% successful. \nPost surgery my mother was able to walk a few steps on the very next day itself and physiotherapist used to visit twice a day in the Hospital (It is normally once in other hospitals).\nDr Kiran Chouka wanted my mother to walk out of the Hospital on her own right from the beginning and miraculously, with very little support my mother was able to walk out of the hospital on her own.\nGoing an extra mile, he himself also arranged for a very good skilled physiotherapist to come home everyday for 3 weeks (minimum) and I am already looking forward to the day when my mother will walk without any pain.\nDr Kiran is a genius and extremely passionate towards his work. At such a young age he has excelled in the field of Orthopedics and yet is very down to earth. Dr Kiran does not have the urge to surpass others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at any cost.\nI am extremely thankful to Dr Kiran Chouka for everything he has done *** ** ** *** **** ********** ******* * **** *** **** *****  I will definitely vouch for him on any given day.",

The Bicep tendon was ruptured not in the shoulder (proximal which has a 99% occurrence rate) but at the elbow (distal 1% occurrence). So I know it will be difficult to find a surgeon who has done such a surgery. However, when I met Dr Kiran Chouka, just listening to my symptoms, he was able to diagnosis what the problem was and where the tendon has ruptured. \n\nHe explained me the complete procedure of the surgery, how complex it is, and what things he needs to take care of because of my body built and the type of bones that we Indians have in the elbow. He also said surgery is not necessary if I am are not going to perform certain activities in my day-to-day life.\n\nWhat I observed are:\n\n1. He is a very confident person.\n2. He is an artist and wants to perform surgery as an artist. That means he wants the surgery to be perfect with minimal incision. \n3. Similar traditional surgeries will involve higher incision areas, whereas, for me, the incision was very minimal. Such a type of surgery will take a longer time and require a huge amount of patience.\n4. The post-surgery dressing was perfect, with pain vanishing within a day.\n5. After 3 visits (in 1.5 months) the doctor asked me no further visits are necessary unless I have any problem.\n\nI am posting this experience after 2.5 years of surgery because I wanted observe the post-surgery complications. However, there are no complications. I am able to perform each and every activity that I used to perform before. And there are no visible marks on my incision point.\n\nThank you doctor for the treatment.",

Dr. Kiran did not rush into any conclusion, he spents sufficient time (30mins+) with the patients to understand the concern every time we met him.  He could easily empathize with my mother & assured her that he will make her walk independently within 3 weeks of TKR Surgery. \n\nBy God\u2019s grace & healing power through Dr. Kiran my mother is now relieved of her knee pain & is able to walk independently.\n\nGod has indeed blessed you with an ability to comfort patients with your warm attitude. You are a God\u2019s sent angel to our prayers\u2026May God Bless you abundantly while you are on this mission to heal more & more such patients. \n",

After two ACL reconstruction both on my right knee in 2007 & left knee in 2014, I managed to twist my left knee & tore my ACL with complex Meniscus tear again in July 2021, I consulted Dr.Kiran Chouka & with his confidence diagnosis we planned to go ahead with the ACL reconstruction & Meniscus repair, he was very clear to make me understand on the procedure & the entire treatment. We finally went ahead with the surgery on 20th Oct 2021 in Columbia Asia Hebbal & the doctor showed me live surgery procedure to build that confidence mentally to know what he was doing & how it was done so it gave me a boost to know what procedure my knee underwent. I would like to thank the entire team who performed the surgery right from the Anesthesia Specialist Dr.Chandrashekar who played good songs during procedure to Dr.Kiran Chouka's team of doctors - Santosh, Tarun, Devraj & the whole nursing staff who was part of the procedure. With confidence & what next & how to strengthen my both legs with the next physiotherapy sessions, I am signing off to follow the next adventure journey.",

There is a saying that goes like \"If you cant teach it to a six year old, then you dont understand the thing\". Now I am no 6 year old, but the way Dr. Kiran explained the anatomy of the knee and the exact problem that I was facing, I was pretty sure that he knows all about this and my case was in the best hands.\nThe complete process and formalities of the surgery were done without any hassle and I was even shown the live surgery where the Dr. communicated with me and highlighted the issues and steps being taken to resolve them. It was one of a kind experience for me the way this entire surgery was carried out. \nDr. Kiran and his entire team will make you feel at home all the time and is highly recommended for orthopaedic surgeries.",

My son had a fall while cycling and on taking to a nearby hospital was advised he needs to go thru a surgery and plate/screws implants are required. I was lucky to find Dr.Kiran Chouka on time and reached out to him. He was patiently waiting for us in Apollo Hospital around 6.30pm, saw my son's injury and explained us the details of injury/bone breakage and how he would operate on the injury. The next day operation was performed and for our luck Dr Kiran managed to complete the process without any implants and just with a pin which was removed over the next 2 weeks. The best part of the surgery was NO external part in my son's hand which will cause any kind of discomfort as he grows up. Lastly, really appreciate the patience and passion Dr. Kiran has towards treating his patients and special mention about the way he treats kids.. He personally did the dressing of both the PoP and the Green bandage after removal of the pins",

Due to few suggestions given I had taken a chance of visiting an ayurvedic center for the same in which a Puttur Cut was done for my hand and this was continued for the next three months since the incident. However, there was no signs of recovery and my wrist started growing in a wrong position and my bones were crushed inside into pieces and this was known to me after a MRI scanning was done and due to this I had lost hope that I would fight back again as I'm an International Muay Thai Indian player who won  a Silver Medal in World Muay Thai Championship held in Bangkok ,5 Times National gold medalists in India and won various competitions so far. Then one of our family doctor (Dr.Dhamodar) suggested Dr.Kiran Chouka the best orthopedic surgeon in india for my treatment. At first I went with 0% hope but the way I was treated and given a ray of hope was simply amazing which made me get a hope of recovery. I was suggested a surgery had to be done which lasted for 3-4 hours and Dr. Kiran Chouka had taken a huge risk in doing this surgery for me as it was a complicated case. But with his hardwork and our family prayers my hand is recovering at its best and I'm very thankful to Dr. Kiran Chouka for bringing my hand almost to an old form in just one month of surgery dated (19/01/2021).",

Unfortunately my hubby came to be covid +  asymptomatic and doctors were regretting to do his surgery and few asked me double the surgery cost and due to our financial crisis we had to wait for 14 days and did home isolation . I was very nervous as his  hand condition was  getting severe day by day and he was suffering with pain . And finally Dilipji gave us Dr.Kiran Chouka contact number and he immediately responded and called us  and said  even if it comes positive test he will do the surgery as we cannot delay it any more. After two days surgery was done and my husband right arm was saved  . Dr.Kiran is so down to earth, full of positivity and very helpful. ** ** ** ***** **** ** *** ** ** *** ** ******** We are Greatful to you sirji. You are a saviour and a protector.",

But none of the doctors gave the confirmation or the confidence of the condition post replacement. But when we visited Dr Kiran Chouka, the way he did explain about her condition, the procedure of the treatment was really nice. Followed by that he gave the confidence that post surgery, she will be able to walk like a normal human being. The way he spoke was like magic. My mom had not said OK to any of the doctors for the surgery. But after listening to him, on same visit, she said OK. And we scheduled the surgery with a weeks time. And the way Dr Kiran handled the case was amazing. One thing we liked about him is the connect with the patient is superb(hardly found in many doctors). With his words we can make it out that treating some who is suffering with knee pain is his passion. \n\nWord strongly recommend to vist Dr Kiran Chouka if you are suffering for arthritis and trust me, you will be like \"yes. He is the one who can make the pain vanish like anything\". \n\nAfter my mom, it was my aunt who got treated by Kiran and the result is same.\n\nWhenever my mom and my aunt meet, for sure they will talk about DR Kiran and thank him.",

My grandfather was completely against the surgery since he was around 80years old, but when we consultated dr.kiran he made us understand the consequence of getting done the knee replacement and its benefits. His words bought lot of confidence in my grand father. As there is a saying \"Where there is a will there is a way\" felt so true wen we spoke to him.Finally he made up his mind to get operated and there was tremandous results in 2 weeks of post surgery. Now he is completely independent in doing all his work and he is very confident n healthy.he is able to do walking for about 1km without any difficulty.\nAll thanks to dynamic n highly skilled Dr.Kiran chouka, Every patient needs a doctor like u. My high reccomandation to all patients who is suffering from arthritis.",

I would definitely recommend Dr Kiran Chouka for knee replacement surgery. After the surgery within a week my father was walking independently and also started using steps slowly. For my father initially there was bit knees pain and gradually knees pain are reduced. Dr Kiran sir teams, physio and Manipal hospital staffs are very much supportive. Its good to do physio for 3weeks after surgery and beyond that shall continue as per patients comfort. Thanks a lot to Dr. Kiran Chouka sir, his team, physio and Manipal hospital staffs for the successful surgery now my father is doing very well.",

It has been two months since the surgery, wherein I was put through Physio theraphy sessions under the care of  keroj kumar for a month, who comes across as a very caring, efficient professional. I am feeling very good now ,and have almost got back my mobility like it was prior to the knee pain. Wish all the very best to Dr.Kiran and his team",

I had a successful surgery 2 weeks back and will be able to walk in 2 months. All thanks to the doctor. Without his help and support we wouldnt even think of this day. Myself and my wife would recommend people to go to Dr. Kiran. He is really magical. Thanks doctor for everything..\nIn all, I am very thankful to Dr Kiran Chouka and his team.

He treats his patients as if they are his own family members.\nMy mother was suffering from severe knee pain from past 2-3 years, we consulted many doctors and took the treatment, but there was no improvement. One fine day we met Dr. Kiran Sir and then he explained about the surgery and necessary procedures, we got the confidence to proceed with knee replacement surgery. The operation was successful and now my mother is able to walk as earlier without pain. I am writing this review 2 months post surgery.\nNo words are enough to appreciate his treatment, hard work, dedication. He is highly experienced and knowledgeable Doctor.\nHeartfelt thanks to Dr. Kiran Chouka for being supportive *** **** ****** to my mother.\nAlso, I must say that he has very good team with his assistant/associate doctors and Physiotherapists. I honestly recommend Dr. Kiran Chouka Sir for knee replacement surgery. \n",

He had multiple fractures ,his thigh bone was completely broken. More of this he is suffering from a rare disease called Osteopetrosis.it was a complicated case for the doctor.We had no other option,we had go through a surgery. Dr Kiran Chouka explained each and every detail of the case .But it was a challenge to do a surgery on this type of bone.Yet we had no other choice. I was not even  assured of success post operation. Dr Kiran Chouka promised me that he is going to his job against the nature and the rest is left to God. The surgery went well and I was told that only time can answer. We were discharged after 5 days .And it was a miracle to see the patient recover so soon. Now after 2 months he is walking without any support. Thanks to Dr Kiran Chouka who took this challenging case and made this successful. He is a friendly guy, every time with a beautiful smile on his face. It is great to see a young doctor with multiple success. Now I am suggesting him to many people I know. I thank Dr Kiran Chouka whole heartedly and God bless him more success in his career. Thank you Dr for being so understanding and for saying not to worry and saying that you are like my brother. And you have done the best for me.\n\n",

He assessed the situation with utmost professionalism and composure.Got an X-ray done immediately.I needed surgery, so he explained everything in detail about the nature of the injury. Made me understand all the possibilities of the surgery and set the right expectation for the recovery and rehabilitation time-line. I was concerned with infection in the wound as it had a very bad cut  that too with dust , grease and what not in it. In OT, he first took the utmost care to clean the wound to the maximum extent possible.When he showed me a pic of my wounded  after cleaning, it was very satisfying I wish I could share the   pictures here. Unbelievable !! Through out the surgery he kept talking to me about my hobbies, what all I do, and even shared his interest. The whole experience was so relaxing !! Post surgery, after getting discharged he still take my call and finds time to talk to me  Thank you Dr. Keep up the extraordinary work ! God bless ! ",

Unfortunately, her bone got a slight bent then which deteriorated over a period of time. She was having acute pain in her knees all the time. She was unable to climb stairs, walk for few meters, stand for more than few minutes. Dr. Kiran explained the issue, correction process and timelines of the treatment. He decided to conduct TKR on both knees. He conducted surgery to straighten the left leg bone and TKR for left leg as a single operation. After few months, he conducted the surgery for right leg TKR. He is always kind and encouraging with words. After more than 1 year of surgery now, my mother is going for daily walking for more than 2-3 Kms. She is doing regular exercise. Recently, the lift in my apartment got repaired, when my mother was returning from walking. She climbed 90 stairs( to 5th floor) without much problem. My mother is 69 yrs now. I am already recommending Dr. Kiran for consulting for any Ortho issues to my friends, co-workers and relatives.",

One of my cousin referred us to Dr Kiran Chouka, with no doubt i can say he is very experienced doctor in Bengaluru for replacing the knee. At our first visit itself he was friendly and explained the root cause of the knee pain. Within 1week he helped us to schedule the Knee surgery at Colombia Asia hospital. Surgery took almost 4hrs and it was successful. Post surgery knee pain has gradually reduced and mom is able to walk without the walker, thats the happy moment for us.. On the whole any person who is suffering from Knee pain or any Ortho related issues, please visit Dr Kiran to happily walk pain free for 20yrs..",

Keep up the good work doc. ",

Any patient would immediately repose faith in him. Two months after this incident I happen to fall and suffer from severe fracture on my left hand (humerus bone). The fracture was extremely bad and painful. But,the ever smiling Dr kiran's approach on this was really comforting. After the surgery of almost 4 hours,my family was satisfied with the successful results and Dr kiran spoke to me and his words was so satisfying that it seemed like nothing ever happened. It's his aggresive approach in any of such situations, through which the patients recovery is faster than expected. I would recommend such a wonderful doctor to anyone who suffers from any orthopedic related problems.",
