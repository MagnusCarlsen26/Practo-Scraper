Had she been polite or smiled even once, it would have covered up rest of the negatives.\n\nAbout the clinic-I was charged 700 by Apollo Clinic for the consultation, however Practo mentions it as 650 and I wasn\u2019t even provided a receipt of it. When I asked about the change in fees, the receptionist was pretty impolite.",

She was the most lousiest doctor we ever consulted, she absolutely could not communicate the issues in detail with us/the patient. She just checked the patient, told us about the infection and noted down the prescription. She clearly looked in a hurry to leave the clinic, and did not even communicate the do's and don'ts, aftercare etc. Infact we had to ask her on our own about why the fever, blood pressure and all. The doctor paid no attention to detail and just wanted to prescribe the medication and leave. After paying 600 for the consultation charges (which is huge for a 7 years experience doctor) we had to leave the clinic with such an experience wondering what else could have the doctor possibly looked into. ********** ***** ******* lack of communication with the patient and not comforting enough. Please choose your general physicians wisely.",
