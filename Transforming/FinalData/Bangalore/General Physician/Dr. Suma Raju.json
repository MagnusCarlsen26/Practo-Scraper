What impressed me was the way Dr. Suma spoke with my mother.  Even though it was our first visit, she spoke with us like we were family.  When we asked about my mother\u2019s creatinine levels, Dr. Suma managed to ease off my mother\u2019s worries instantly.   Dr. Suma is much more than a competent Doctor. She is a fine human being, compassionate, and really concerned about her patients.  She is extremely patient and gives her advice calmly.  She explains everything clearly and she does not hesitate to answer any number of questions.   Even if it is anything other than nephrology, she is willing to give general advice.  A meeting with Dr. Suma does not give you the feeling that you are at a hospital.  An excellent Doctor, I highly recommend Dr. Suma Raju.",

When we asked about my mother\u2019s creatinine levels, Dr. Suma managed to ease off my mother\u2019s worries instantly.   Dr. Suma is much more than a competent Doctor. She is a fine human being, compassionate, and really concerned about her patients.  She is extremely patient and gives her advice calmly.  She explains everything clearly and she does not hesitate to answer any number of questions.   Even if it is anything other than nephrology, she is willing to give general advice.  A meeting with Dr. Suma does not give you the feeling that you are at a hospital.  An excellent Doctor, I highly recommend Dr. Suma Raju.",
