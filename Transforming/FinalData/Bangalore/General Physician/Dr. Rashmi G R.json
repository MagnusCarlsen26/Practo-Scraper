She had a wonderful experience with Dr Rashmi who is really an excellent person, has lot of medical abilities and helped my mom in reducing her medicines which she was using for the past 12 years. Without Dr Rashmi and her coach Nilufur it wouldn't be possible for my mom to reduce her hba1c to 5.7% now . Excellent and commendable support from all the team members, staff i must not forget to thank their for hospitality and  how they greet their patients at the clinic. It's very clean and neat atmosphere. The diabetes therapy was a great experience to be true. Overall I am very grateful and thankful to Dr Rashmi and the entire team of Sugarfit family. I highly recommend Sugarfit to my family relatives and my friends. Thanks Sugarfit for helping my mom reverse her diabetes so easily \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f ",

She had a wonderful experience with Dr Rashmi who is really an excellent person, has lot of medical abilities and helped my mom in reducing her medicines which she was using for the past 12 years. Without Dr Rashmi and her coach Nilufur it wouldn't be possible for my mom to reduce her hba1c to 5.7% now . Excellent and commendable support from all the team members, staff i must not forget to thank their for hospitality and  how they greet their patients at the clinic. It's very clean and neat atmosphere. The diabetes therapy was a great experience to be true. Overall I am very grateful and thankful to Dr Rashmi and the entire team of Sugarfit family. I highly recommend Sugarfit to my family relatives and my friends. Thanks Sugarfit for helping my mom reverse her diabetes so easily \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f ",
