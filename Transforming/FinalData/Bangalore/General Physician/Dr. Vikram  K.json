Even though I am not diabetic currently, but my motive to join this program was to manage my pre-diabetic levels. Doctor Vikram's knowledge of the subject and his way of dealing with diabetes amazed me as I started to notice the results within one week after I followed his guidance. Earlier I used to see 130 - 135 fasting and 170-190 postprandial readings and it's now been more than two months and my readings have been pretty much under control (100-110 FBS) and (130-140 PP). I would strongly recommend this program to anyone who would like to manage diabetes or just want to lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you Dr. Vikram and team for showing me the path to diabetes reversal. ",

Even though I am not diabetic currently, but my motive to join this program was to manage my pre-diabetic levels. Doctor Vikram's knowledge of the subject and his way of dealing with diabetes amazed me as I started to notice the results within one week after I followed his guidance. Earlier I used to see 130 - 135 fasting and 170-190 postprandial readings and it's now been more than two months and my readings have been pretty much under control (100-110 FBS) and (130-140 PP). I would strongly recommend this program to anyone who would like to manage diabetes or just want to lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you Dr. Vikram and team for showing me the path to diabetes reversal. ",
