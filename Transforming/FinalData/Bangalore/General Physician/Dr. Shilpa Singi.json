Also she does not believe in prescribing unnecessary and lots of medicines, tests etc. Believes in a very targeted minimalist medicines approach which avoids all side effects.\nMy wife has been suffering from stomach problems for over 20 years. We consulted dozens of very senior Gastro specialists in Delhi and Bangalore without any success. But Dr Shilpa was able to diagnose problem (after almost an hour long talk with my wife) and prescribed only one medicine which has worked so well like a miracle.\nThanks a lot Dr Shilpa. May we get many more doctors like you. ",

I met her when I was diagnosed with Diabetes and was really tensed because of getting diagnosed in my early 30s. Dr. Shilpa instantly made me comfortable and had a great empathy. She gives enough time to patients and develops a great bond. After 3 months of treatment and significant improvement in my health be it my noticeable weight loss as a result of diet and workout suggested by her or be it my diabetes being in control, I want to heartily thank Dr. Shilpa for her treatment, help and instilling confidence in me. I wish we have more such calm, patient and understanding doctors around.  This is my warm recommendation for Dr. Shilpa",

Also she does not believe in prescribing unnecessary and lots of medicines, tests etc. Believes in a very targeted minimalist medicines approach which avoids all side effects.\nMy wife has been suffering from stomach problems for over 20 years. We consulted dozens of very senior Gastro specialists in Delhi and Bangalore without any success. But Dr Shilpa was able to diagnose problem (after almost an hour long talk with my wife) and prescribed only one medicine which has worked so well like a miracle.\nThanks a lot Dr Shilpa.

I met her when I was diagnosed with Diabetes and was really tensed because of getting diagnosed in my early 30s. Dr. Shilpa instantly made me comfortable and had a great empathy. She gives enough time to patients and develops a great bond. After 3 months of treatment and significant improvement in my health be it my noticeable weight loss as a result of diet and workout suggested by her or be it my diabetes being in control, I want to heartily thank Dr. Shilpa for her treatment, help and instilling confidence in me. I wish we have more such calm, patient and understanding doctors around.  This is my warm recommendation for Dr. Shilpa",
