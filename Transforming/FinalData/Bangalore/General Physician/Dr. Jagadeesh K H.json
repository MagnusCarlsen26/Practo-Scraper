Dr. patiently listened to us and guided us appropriately.He spent time listening to us and patiently answered all our questions with details. He was not in a hurry to do many tests and did what's required for the issue. Very happy with the Dr. experience and I would recommend Dr. Jagadeesh.This is my 1st visit after it became Manipal Hospital. (Earlier it was Columbia Asia)I felt a whole new level of professionalism, speed and care for patients with all staff members of MH. ",
