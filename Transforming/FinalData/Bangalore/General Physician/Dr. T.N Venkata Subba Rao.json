I got to know Dr T N Venkata Subba rao sir from my cousin and I took my mother to him. He is basically Diabetic specialist, but still I took my mother and went for consultation. Seeing her condition, he immediately spoke with the concerned dept doctor at Vikram hospital, booked appointment for us and asked us to go and consult him. After that it took almost a year for her to come back to normal condition. Now she is slowly recovering and able to walk, sit and stand on her own. During the first consultation itself the doctor informed us this will take nearly 2-3 years to get cured and as they told I can see the difference in her health.\n\nBut I can assure you that if you need correct diagnosis and treatment, I would recommend you to visit Subba Rao sir and take his advise specially if you are diabetic\n\nRegards,\nDurga Siva Prasad",

He is treating my father, Anantha Ramaiah garu for the last 3yrs and sugar controls are well maintained with his prescription. He is not a one who directly start giving medicine. He ask us to get full body checkup and analyse each and every part and even suggest in other areas too and get diagnosed by other references. That's his speciality.\nThe fb sessions he is providing now with Sandeep are excellent.\nHopefully you guys will utilise these sessions.\n\nThanks",

He gave us the right and relevant contacts which helped me to fix relevant appointments and tests\n4.
