She recommended few investigations and then it showed that my sugar levels are also uncontrolled so as my bp. She suggested good medicines for each n every health issue of mine and few good advices. Today after one month again I visited her and now my creatinine is within normal range and sugars also reduced. I'm very happy with her consultation and now feeling energetic also. I do recommend her who is seeking for good advice and consultation. ",

She recommended few investigations and then it showed that my sugar levels are also uncontrolled so as my bp. She suggested good medicines for each n every health issue of mine and few good advices. Today after one month again I visited her and now my creatinine is within normal range and sugars also reduced. I'm very happy with her consultation and now feeling energetic also. I do recommend her who is seeking for good advice and consultation. ",

As a good doctor I should not reveal any details regarding the patient and I'm not going to do that.\n\nRegarding fitness - you should see the two pages of recommendation that were written by me after full evaluation of your mother in law with advice that has to be followed by her prior to surgery. Additionally, I also consulted for you mother in law's sleeping issues on your husband's demand (though she was not my patient) and I wrote medication for her.\n\nIt's very shameful that you know only half of the story and you're putting feedback like this, that too anonymously.

The ECG was done & we met with Dr. Darshini Mehta. As soon as we entered her chamber, she asked us to close the door & asked for 500 bucks extra. We had already paid the consultation fees & registration charges at the billing desk earlier. Despite that she demanded another 500 bucks to give to her & not at the billing desk. We were stunned by her behavior & my husband had to give 500 bucks without getting any receipt from her.  She then just wrote that the patient is fit for the surgery. Is this how you consult a doctor there?",
