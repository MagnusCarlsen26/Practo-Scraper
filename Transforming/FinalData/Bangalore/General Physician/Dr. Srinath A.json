She has been taking insulin and other medicines like janumet, vobligose for last 5-6 years. We came across this centre through a friend and attended Dr Srinath consult. His treatment plan, approach to diabetes management was very different. He helped us use this technology of continuous monitoring of sugar and told my mother what js affecting her levels. The centre provides support for all diabetes management. My mother sugar has come from 300 to 110 in fasting, and medicine also gone down. Appreciate the treatment of doctor and his team. ",
