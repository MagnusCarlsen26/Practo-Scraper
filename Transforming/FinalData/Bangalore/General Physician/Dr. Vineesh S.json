It was very unfortunate that the Test report of scrup typus came late. The test was given at st. John hospital and they delayed the report for more than three days. During that period fever was not reduced it was on &off. The  moment I received  that report, I came & meet Dr Vineesh, we started taking proper antibiotics orally based on his suggestion. Finally my wife started recovering slowly. along with antibodies medicine we took dolo 650 to control the fever. at end of 5th day course still she was felling so tired and fever badly. unfortunately she also had her period at the end of 5th day course. we were very lucky to  meet Dr  Vineesh, he was very good and understands our problems very well. And Finally Dr Vineesh suggested antibiotics over iv for 3days. it was helped her lot. she  completely recovered now \n\nI would highly recommend him.",

It was very unfortunate that the Test report of scrup typus came late. The test was given at st. John hospital and they delayed the report for more than three days. During that period fever was not reduced it was on &off. The  moment I received  that report, I came & meet Dr Vineesh, we started taking proper antibiotics orally based on his suggestion. Finally my wife started recovering slowly. along with antibodies medicine we took dolo 650 to control the fever. at end of 5th day course still she was felling so tired and fever badly. unfortunately she also had her period at the end of 5th day course. we were very lucky to  meet Dr  Vineesh, he was very good and understands our problems very well. And Finally Dr Vineesh suggested antibiotics over iv for 3days. it was helped her lot. she  completely recovered now \n\nI would highly recommend him.",
