Minimum with long term resolutions and avoid getting sick again and again & it worked. Yes i was surprised too that recommended lifestyle changes fixed by fever issues even when i was scared. Good thing is that he usually prescribe things in a way that you don't have to revisit.\n\nOn another note, avoid visiting him on weekend. Its badly packed. His schedule is extremely tight and you might not get a good outcome. He wont see things properly and will be usually in hurry to clear patients as thr is usually an extremely long queue & absolutely no walk-ins allowed.\n\nMy experience on general medicine has been good so far and never visited on anything higher so for that you need someone else's feedback.",

I was asked what medicine do I use for my Diabetes.   When I showed the medicines I was using, the South Africa Physician said the prescribed medicines were latest available in the market and are very good.  I was very happy to hear that the Dr Manohar uses all the knowledge he acquired from various seminars and workshop. He has also treated my parents and has been treating my wife and my mother in law.  I also appreciate the Dr. Manohar for his social awareness and giving back to the society.

Even on asking how he arrived at the drug, he says it's better than Cefatoxime marked sensitive on the report. It is never a game of better among things not even tested on the report. \n\nTurns out both are third generation cephalosporins, and it doesn't make sense to prescribe one not tested sensitive in the report. Another two third generation cephalosporins were tested resistant in the report, Ceftadizime and Ceftriaxone. It was risky to prescribe an untested antibiotic.\n",

It took a few days for the WBC to come up. I am thankful to Dr. Manohar for the various matters, some of them being; \n1.\tMy family doctor who is a senior Endocrinologist coordinated with Dr.Manohar for my treatment, he was kind enough and obliged to keep him in the loop seamlessly. \n2.\tDr.Manohar often had my lab results at the tip of his fingers and compared the numbers with ease. \n3.\tWith his PPE and with seven days of continuous stint with covid patients, he was kind and gave me a patient hearing and also discussed the immediate next plans. \n4.\tI am an experienced patient and with that I say, he handled my matter with utmost authority on the subject and with care. \nI am highly grateful to him to have supported my case in this very difficult covid situation.  \nRegards\nShruthi ",

Good thing is that he usually prescribe things in a way that you don't have to revisit.\n\nOn another note, avoid visiting him on weekend. Its badly packed. His schedule is extremely tight and you might not get a good outcome. He wont see things properly and will be usually in hurry to clear patients as thr is usually an extremely long queue & absolutely no walk-ins allowed.\n\nMy experience on general medicine has been good so far and never visited on anything higher so for that you need someone else's feedback.",

I was asked what medicine do I use for my Diabetes.   When I showed the medicines I was using, the South Africa Physician said the prescribed medicines were latest available in the market and are very good.  I was very happy to hear that the Dr Manohar uses all the knowledge he acquired from various seminars and workshop. He has also treated my parents and has been treating my wife and my mother in law.

It is never a game of better among things not even tested on the report. \n\nTurns out both are third generation cephalosporins, and it doesn't make sense to prescribe one not tested sensitive in the report. Another two third generation cephalosporins were tested resistant in the report, Ceftadizime and Ceftriaxone. It was risky to prescribe an untested antibiotic.\n",

It took a few days for the WBC to come up. I am thankful to Dr. Manohar for the various matters, some of them being; \n1.\tMy family doctor who is a senior Endocrinologist coordinated with Dr.Manohar for my treatment, he was kind enough and obliged to keep him in the loop seamlessly. \n2.\tDr.Manohar often had my lab results at the tip of his fingers and compared the numbers with ease. \n3.\tWith his PPE and with seven days of continuous stint with covid patients, he was kind and gave me a patient hearing and also discussed the immediate next plans. \n4.\tI am an experienced patient and with that I say, he handled my matter with utmost authority on the subject and with care. \nI am highly grateful to him to have supported my case in this very difficult covid situation.  \nRegards\nShruthi ",

This person was quite busy with his stuffs and not bother of listening carefully as what i am telling to him. At the end he could not even give me a reason as why this might be happening and instead he said he would try a medicine to see if that works. And then finally he prescribed a medicine. He wrote a medicine and even didn't mention the power of the medicine. Now what power medicine am I supposed to buy? So should i go 40 kms (as i do not have his contact details) and ask him to mention the power or he should have mentioned it at that time itself? **** ***** *** **** ** *** ********* **** ****** *** ***** ** * **** ******* *** *** **** ** ** ******* **** ** *** ******** *** *** **** **** I paid and visited with some hope not to get such responses.
