I texted you 2 minutes before the actual appointment time and the video call was not answered for the next 8 minutes when I had to initiate the audio call. Hence I understand there was less time but I thought you still narrated the entire clinical history. I have also brought it to the notice of practo support team regarding the technical issues of the video call not going through. Apologies for the same.\nAlso the consultation is giving you free chat messages for the next 7 days where you can ask any doubts or queries to the doctor and it's not just one point consultation. \nI hope your daughter has recovered well by now. Thankyou for your valuable feedback.",
