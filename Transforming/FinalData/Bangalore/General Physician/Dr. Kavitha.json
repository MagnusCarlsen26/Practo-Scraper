When we first came to know about our diabetic conditions, we were bit worried and had a very negative mind set. But after meeting Dr.Kavitha, in the first meeting itself, the confidence that she gave us helped us a lot to control the sugar levels. The way she treated us, medicine and advice she gave helped us a lot. We really are thankful to her for being so friendly and helpful to fight against diabetes and lead a normal life",
