,,0,0,YES,The doctor was over an hour late. Apollo clinic in Bellandur has one of the most ineffective practices in patient management ,2024-07-08 08:05:10,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Wait time,","Preventive Medicine,",0,0,NO,"I waited for more than 30 minutes, and the doctor still didn't show up. We are also working professionals and have to plan out the day around such events. Doctors can't take timings for granted and leisurely walk in whenever they want. If there is a delay expected, you need to inform the patients so that we can plan our schedules better as well. 
Also, the clinic is in such a bad location. There is no parking, there is a board saying 'parking for doctors only'. I had to drop my wife off and had to continuously roam around in the car due to the non-existence of parking. Such information should be communicated on the listing. Parking for such a big clinic is pretty obvious.",2024-01-11 07:38:31,False,False,Supreet Singh,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Stomach pain and stomach upset,",0,0,YES,"I tried Dr. Bindu 2 years back when my family physician wasnt available and I am so glad we happen to meet her. she has a knack of identifying underlying issues with such ease that most doctor's of todays times are not very capable of and most rely on a zillion lab test. She is a patient listener, will probe and understand the issues before recommending any tests (avoids unnecessary lab tests) and avoids prescribing unnecessary medicines and antibiotic. She was able to diagnose my problem so well which was wrongly diagnosed with another doctor at one of the corporate hospitals. Her pragmatic approach and her great sense of gut feeling is what me and my family love the most. She is always so approachable and now I visit Dr. Bindu for my whole family including my 4 year old daughter and my parents too. Thanks a zillion Dr. Bindu!",2021-09-21 11:21:48,False,True,Bhavana Shah Devireddy,,,
