More than half of the illness went off after meeting her as she allowed me to explain my problem and gave the medicines accordingly.  \nSecond time I went for throat infection and cough.  She really made me feel comfortable to tell my problems and checked physically properly and gave medicines. As I already mentioned her vibrations are powerful to cure us both physically and emotionally.  \nEven I used ask some questions through what's app.  She used to reply for them also. Very rarely we get such doctors now a days. Thank you so very much  doctor for everything U did.  Please remain same as it is the immense benefit for the mankind.  I highly recommend Dr.Ameena. Thank you again\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

In cases where further investigation is needed she recommends the same and does not unnecessarily give medication.\nI 100% recommend her.\nYou will not be disappointed\n\n",

She extended her help through calls & whatsapp , she reviewed the lab results online and even offered second opinion about the diagnosis and treatment management. These were one step ahead in doctor-patient relationship which helped me at the receiving end. She takes enough time to listen to our queries, actively listens to our issues at hand and suggests better options available. I strongly recommend Dr Ameena. She is approachable on emergencies.

Dr Ameena has always been available in addressing emergencies rather my anxieties and gives me the right advise and assurance  with no delay. She always goes out of her of way to ensure you are doing well. Her follow up on how well you are doing is something very personal to me, running on such a tight schedule , she still makes time to check on your progress.\nThank you so much Doctor.  ",
