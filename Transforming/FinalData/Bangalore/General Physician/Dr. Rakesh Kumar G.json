The doctor didn\u2019t even bother to check the details about my reports my age and instead told the receptionist Archana, I need to get that check up done again.\n\nThis is a very bad experience from the hospital. Never visiting again.",

Doctor is a good listener and gives ample opportunity for the patient to explain his health condition. Rakesh is such a doctor who believes that less medication or only the required dose that will help the patient. He encourages his patients to also participate in healing his own issues by practicing home remedies.  The doctor gives appropriate medical guidance. I recommend Dr. Rakesh based on his expertise and experience  in his field. ",
