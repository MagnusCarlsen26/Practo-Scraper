I had a bad experience only with this doctor Sudhindra. I booked an appointment this saturday at 3:10pm, and reached on time. I was asked to wait for more than 45 mins. I enquired again, that's when I saw the doctor walk out in front of me. The receptionist ran behind, literally pleaded for me. Doctor did not show any kind of empathy, he threw a rude look and walked away. The staff was embarrassed to faced me, more was I. I had to leave and book an appointment elsewhere. Will never recommend such a doctor to anyone.",

I enquired again, that's when I saw the doctor walk out in front of me. The receptionist ran behind, literally pleaded for me. Doctor did not show any kind of empathy, he threw a rude look and walked away. The staff was embarrassed to faced me, more was I. I had to leave and book an appointment elsewhere.
