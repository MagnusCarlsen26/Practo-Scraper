I was suffering with fever and loose motion after a travel history and local physician in my town diagnosed me with typhoid as the widal test came positive and the medicines which he suggested were very strong ones .

I wanted to take a second opinion as I was suspicious over the diagnosis of ‚Äútyphoid ‚Äú 
Then I searched and found dr Raja . He told me that by my appearance I don‚Äôt seem to be down with typhoid (can you believe it ? He was seeing me over video call ) , and widal test usually comes positive if done in initial 3-4 days of normal viral fever also /usually not a correct report . Hence he advised me to do a blood culture report and in the interim he put me on mild antibiotics and probiotic treatment . And I started feeling much improved from second day onwards and almost recovered in span of 4 days .
Also the blood culture report ruled out any presence of pathogens there by making the chance of typhoid as null and void .

So thank you Dr Raja for saving me from becoming guinea pig . I highly thank you for your sharp acumen, knowledge , anticipation , human touch and friendly approach .
Doctors like you are tough to find .I have no second thought in recommending you for the betterment of society .my since thanks again and May gud bless you always .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Typhoid Fever Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I highly recommend the doctor. 

A few weeks ago, I was running a very high temperature. We had consulted two doctors before visiting Dr Raja and they had asked us to wait for 3 days for the temp to come down as it was most likely viral fever in their opinion. But after 3 days, the temperature was still running very high (103-104). When we visited Dr Raja at his clinic, he listened to us patiently and quickly conducted a few tests. Since I had no other symptoms, the doctor studied the case thoroughly and even consulted his peers to make an accurate prognosis.  He was very clear with his approach and explained to us the possible causes and treatment in detail. 

Finally, it turned out to be a rare case of typhoid which had caused severe liver inflammation. But by the time the typhoid results were in, I was already on the medication for it!

I was hospitalized in his clinic for 4 days and the staff (esp. Ms Jennifer & Ms Zainab) took very good care of me. We are very grateful to the doctor and the staff for all the help provided during that period.
