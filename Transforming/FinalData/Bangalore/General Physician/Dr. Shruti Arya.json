My father and I got covid and my father was badly impacted with pneumonia (70%), hard to breathe without an oxygen mask, and in a danger zone. I was entering the same zone, but contact Dr. Shruthi at the right time where she guided us every day, had call with us and family members to explain the situation. She was very patient explaining all medical terms that we had questions for. During our treatment, she herself became Covid+, but that didn't stop her to give her best to us. Must appreciate her knowledge and expertise in the medical line,  and would highly recommend her.",

In night, they ran few more tests, and full body CT Scan which is very rare, generally it is run in specific body part to conclude on issue as iti s very dangerous to get so much exposure to rays. Again no explanation on why. All test reports came fine as nothing was there. She requested for few more test for which reports are expected after 2 days and nothing to do hospital admission and on my request discharged me as I didn\u2019t see any reason for admission.  I received reports and met doctor again with reports of tests where my viral ebv-vca Antibody to Viral Capsid comes 104 where limit is 20 and wbc improving.

I was scared that it may ne kidney stone.Finally after Rs.8500 spent on the scan, it revealed to be muscular pain. So why was I exposed to radiation? I reported the incident to Manipal Hospital's Management, but they justified the CT Scan. Manipal has a bad reputation for the similar experiences. Would not recommend the doctor as well as the hospital.",

I sent doctor with reports as she was on leave next day. She asked me to get admitted on urgent basis on seeing my wbc count high without explaining the need and said need to run more tests. In night, they ran few more tests, and full body CT Scan which is very rare, generally it is run in specific body part to conclude on issue as iti s very dangerous to get so much exposure to rays. Again no explanation on why. All test reports came fine as nothing was there. She requested for few more test for which reports are expected after 2 days and nothing to do hospital admission and on my request discharged me as I didn\u2019t see any reason for admission.  I received reports and met doctor again with reports of tests where my viral ebv-vca Antibody to Viral Capsid comes 104 where limit is 20 and wbc improving.
