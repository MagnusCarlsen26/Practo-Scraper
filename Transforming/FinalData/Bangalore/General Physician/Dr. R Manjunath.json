I had to request the doc in emergency to attend my wife and then he treated her. She was given some injections in the saline. post that we were asked to pay or else saline needle will not be removed .. I was asked to go to billing counter to pay and there were hardly anyone on the front desk.. I had to request to take the bills.. I wasn\u2019t explained about what the charges were all about and was asked to pay approx  4300 I was already feeling restless coz of being distressed and tired.. this is not the way you treat a patient who comes with lot of hope..

Next day on 1st my wife\u2019s report was sent to me via email and I did not receive my report.. I had to call the number mentioned in the email 20 times and I was transferred from one line to the other.. I was asked to collect it physically despite being positive.. next day had to rush my wife as she has discomfort in her stomach.. we at emergency  ward was made to Aga Ian wait for 30 mins.stating Manjunath was in rounds he will come n he never turned up. I had to request the doc in emergency to attend my wife and then he treated her. She was given some injections in the saline. post that we were asked to pay or else saline needle will not be removed .. I was asked to go to billing counter to pay and there were hardly anyone on the front desk.. I had to request to take the bills.. I wasn\u2019t explained about what the charges were all about and was asked to pay approx  4300 I was already feeling restless coz of being distressed and tired.. this is not the way you treat a patient who comes with lot of hope.. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Manipal hospital ever. ",

May be due to corona scarcity, he might have avoided the practical examination. The staff was very cooperative. It took only 5 minutes for X-ray. When I took the reports, the doctor was already left. I was redirected to visit after one week. I neither visit again nor took those medications. The reason was that, I am not a nonsmoker but I smoke occasionally. I have mentioned it when he asked. But in prescription, it was mentioned that I smoke on a regular basis. So it made me confused about whether those medicines were suitable or not. I didn't get a chance to solve my doubts as he was already left.",
