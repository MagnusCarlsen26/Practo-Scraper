,,0,0,YES,"Dr Soubhagyamoyee  is very kind, humble, knowledgeable, well experienced and very friendly Doctor. I along with my family member have consulted  for multiple health issues and she always suggested us the right treatment by God's grace. she always listens to our concerns  with so much of patience and answers all of them with a smile. It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.I’m eternally grateful and I’ll always be thankful to Dr Soubhagyamoyee for her support and kindness .",2024-01-04 09:09:05,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

She also made comments about ********, questioning gender equality and mentioning maternity leaves. ** **** **** *** ******** **** ** **** *** ***** ************* Eventually, I sought a second opinion at another clinic, ***** * ********** ***** ** ******** ***** *** ******** ****** **********
