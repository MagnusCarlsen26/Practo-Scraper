My HbA1c dropped from 9.6 to 6.4 demonstrating the effectiveness of her approach.\n\nI\u2019m very impressed with the service at the Sugar.fit diabetes clinic in HSR Layout. The health counsellors, Misba, and operations manager Akhilesh, have been incredibly supportive and professional, offering excellent guidance and care. The clinic is always clean and well-maintained, thanks to the dedicated housekeeping staff. Their attention to hygiene adds to the positive experience at the center. Thank you to the entire team for your exceptional service!\n\n",

When I started the programme, my HbA1c values were shockingly high at 8.5%. After following the personalized plan by the Doctor, health coach and the dedicated team, my HbA1c values have reduced to an outstanding 5.7%. This huge improvement has improved both my health and my entire quality of life.\n\nThe Sugarfit personnel deserve special recognition. They are really supportive, ************* and always willing to help with any questions or issues. ` Their encouragement and expertise have made the major change in my health.\n\nThe clinic is in excellent condition. It is well-equipped with modern amenities and offers a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. Appointments are well-organized, resulting in short wait times and a seamless overall experience. \n\nTo summarize, I strongly suggest Sugarfit's diabetes reversal programme to anyone wishing to control and potentially reverse their diabetes. Its combination of professional medical advice, supportive staff, and outstanding facilities sets it apart.",

The health counsellors, Misba, and operations manager Akhilesh, have been incredibly supportive and professional, offering excellent guidance and care. The clinic is always clean and well-maintained, thanks to the dedicated housekeeping staff. Their attention to hygiene adds to the positive experience at the center. Thank you to the entire team for your exceptional service!\n\n",

When I started the programme, my HbA1c values were shockingly high at 8.5%. After following the personalized plan by the Doctor, health coach and the dedicated team, my HbA1c values have reduced to an outstanding 5.7%. This huge improvement has improved both my health and my entire quality of life.\n\nThe Sugarfit personnel deserve special recognition. They are really supportive, ************* and always willing to help with any questions or issues. ` Their encouragement and expertise have made the major change in my health.\n\nThe clinic is in excellent condition. It is well-equipped with modern amenities and offers a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. Appointments are well-organized, resulting in short wait times and a seamless overall experience. \n\nTo summarize, I strongly suggest Sugarfit's diabetes reversal programme to anyone wishing to control and potentially reverse their diabetes.
