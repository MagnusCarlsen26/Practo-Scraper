While I appreciate the opportunity to receive medical care at your facility, I felt compelled to share my concerns about the professionalism and demeanor of Dr. Somnath during my visit.\n\nDuring the appointment, Dr. Somnath displayed several behaviors that I found concerning. For example, when I attempted to ask questions about my father condition, Dr. Mitra seemed dismissive and rushed, providing minimal explanations and failing to address my concerns adequately. Additionally, there were instances where Dr.Mitra tone came across as condescending, which made me feel uncomfortable and unheard as a patient.\nAs a result of Dr. Somnath, I left the appointment feeling frustrated and unsure about my treatment plan. This experience has eroded my trust in dr ability to provide compassionate and competent care. Although I have been referred to him by Dr Palankar. Even though I thought of admitting my patient under Dr. Somnath but by seeing his behaviour I can't go forward to get treatment of my father ***** **** ************** *******",

Instead he told that his patient is going to miss his flight and hence he has to prioritise and I was asked to wait. \nHorrible experience from such an experienced doctor. After being in the hospital for so long, Looks like he has forgotten that he is a doctor to help people in pain!!!! ",

While I appreciate the opportunity to receive medical care at your facility, I felt compelled to share my concerns about the professionalism and demeanor of Dr. Somnath during my visit.\n\nDuring the appointment, Dr. Somnath displayed several behaviors that I found concerning. For example, when I attempted to ask questions about my father condition, Dr. Mitra seemed dismissive and rushed, providing minimal explanations and failing to address my concerns adequately. Additionally, there were instances where Dr.Mitra tone came across as condescending, which made me feel uncomfortable and unheard as a patient.\nAs a result of Dr. Somnath, I left the appointment feeling frustrated and unsure about my treatment plan. This experience has eroded my trust in dr ability to provide compassionate and competent care. Although I have been referred to him by Dr Palankar. Even though I thought of admitting my patient under Dr. Somnath but by seeing his behaviour I can't go forward to get treatment of my father ***** **** ************** *******",

On top of that when I asked how much time is it going to take l, the doctor started shouting in front of everyone and said this is not how it works with me. People who walked in first will get treated first and that's how you have to keep waiting and stay on his door. Keep asking that how much time more ? ** **** *** ***** ******** ** ****** **** *** ******* * *** *** ******** * Please do not confuse people by saying appointment.
