We are extremely satisfied with her accurate diagnoses and, most importantly, the thorough explanations and guidance she provides for the next steps.\n\nOne of the most remarkable qualities of Dr. Sumanjita is her accessibility. She is always available to address any concerns or questions, regardless of the time of day. Her prompt responsiveness and willingness to provide guidance and reassurance make us feel valued and supported as patients. What impresses me the most about Dr. Sumanjita is her willingness to take on a significant amount of responsibility and diligently follow up. She goes the extra mile to ensure that her patients receive the necessary follow-up care, prescriptions, or referrals, leaving no stone unturned in their well-being.\n\nWhen it comes to diagnosing and treating ailments, she is not content with merely addressing the symptoms; instead, she is driven to identify the underlying root cause of the problem. Her genuine listening skills, empathy, and creation of a supportive environment make patients feel comfortable sharing their concerns with her.  Dr. Sumanjita's ensures that she is well-updated about the latest advancement in the medical field, guaranteeing that her patients receive the best possible care and treatment.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Sumanjita has demonstrated exceptional support and assistance to many of our friends and relatives remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her dedication to provide help and support to those during the need of the hour is truly commendable.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sumanjita to anyone seeking a doctor who consistently goes above and beyond for their patients. \n",

Great that you took her to neurologist as per my advice and her condition had been addressed appropriately. \nAs per your concerns towards multivitamin and calcium , actually for elderly people these will add benefits rather than doing any harm . So your mother can continue those . Regarding return of medicines to pharmacy, I am not the concerned person, and individual pharmacy has individual policies. So I couldn\u2019t help on that . \n As a responsible physician and clinical cardiologist my first responsibility towards patient is to Diagnose the disease , treat the disease if it\u2019s in my domain , If disease is not falling in my domain then to refer to the appropriate department. In this case I am happy that I had directed her to appropriate department and got treated properly. \n Hope you understand the visibility and limitations of a medical professional. Doctor doesn\u2019t mean everything one single doctor can do . That's why there are different departments and different specialisations , super specialisations are available in medicine. \n",
