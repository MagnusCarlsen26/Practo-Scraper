,,0,0,NO,"Visited doctor for our 6 months baby who had a bad cold and cough. First of all, I don’t understand the concept of not having a sitting place in the paediatrician room, really not sure on the rationale. We have not found the doctor to be affectionate and thorough. Even after taking the medicine, our baby cough increased a lot and she got an ear infection. As a first time parent, we normally have lots of questions and to my surprise our questions were answered with only bare minimum details and we felt doctor did not had time. No check was done to know the history of the baby as we were visiting for the first time. ",2022-07-22 16:34:04,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
,"Childhood Infections,",0,0,NO,"They charged a registration fee as hospital charges worth Rs.400, which they forced us to pay. It is not mentioned on Practo. This is unprofessional behaviour. Neither will I visit the doctors again nor Birthplace hospital for anything in the future. ",2023-02-21 04:34:32,False,False,Asmita Joshi,,,
