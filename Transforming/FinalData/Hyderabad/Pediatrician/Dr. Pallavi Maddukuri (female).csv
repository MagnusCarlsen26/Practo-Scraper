"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Paediatric Critical Care,",0,0,YES,"She saved my child’s life. My child was having continuous fever and every doctor just prescribed usual medication and sent us home. She was the one who said something different ... she looked at my child’s tummy and felt something wrong. Indeed it was first stage of cancer.  This early detection saved my child !!

God bless her with all the success and knowledge
