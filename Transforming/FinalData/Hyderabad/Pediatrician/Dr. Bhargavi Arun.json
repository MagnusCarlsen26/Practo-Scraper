She had a warm and friendly demeanor that immediately put us at ease. She took the time to listen to my concerns, and then she explained everything in a way that was easy for me to understand. She was patient with my child, answering all of their questions and making them feel comfortable.\n\n*** ******** ** ** ********** ******* *** ************* ****** *** I trust completely with my kid's health. From the first moment I met her, I was impressed by her vast knowledge of medicine and her ability to explain complex medical concepts in a way that was easy for me to understand. She is always up-to-date with the latest medical research and treatments, and she approaches each patient with a thoughtful and thorough understanding of their individual health needs. I am consistently impressed by her ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions with precision and care. Dr. Bhargavi's expertise, combined with her compassionate and attentive bedside manner, make her an exceptional doctor.\n\nThroughout the visit, I could tell that Dr. Bhargavi truly cares about her patients. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and that we left feeling satisfied with our visit. I feel lucky to have found such a caring and compassionate pediatrician for my child, and I would highly recommend Dr. Bhargavi to anyone looking for a friendly and skilled pediatrician.",

We discussed how my daughter was feeling and Doctor gave us a good listening ear. She prescribed good medication. She was thorough and followed up the next day to check if my daughter was feeling better and I told her that yes, as a matter of fact she was. She showed great care and empathy not only for my child but also for me, a very concerned parent. I strongly recommend Dr Bhargavi Arun. Not many doctors today really bother to get to the heart of the problem..they just want to quickly close the discussion and move on to the next patient. But Dr. Bhargavi is different- SHE TRULY CARES. ",

She was patient with my child, answering all of their questions and making them feel comfortable.\n\n*** ******** ** ** ********** ******* *** ************* ****** *** I trust completely with my kid's health. From the first moment I met her, I was impressed by her vast knowledge of medicine and her ability to explain complex medical concepts in a way that was easy for me to understand. She is always up-to-date with the latest medical research and treatments, and she approaches each patient with a thoughtful and thorough understanding of their individual health needs. I am consistently impressed by her ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions with precision and care. Dr. Bhargavi's expertise, combined with her compassionate and attentive bedside manner, make her an exceptional doctor.\n\nThroughout the visit, I could tell that Dr. Bhargavi truly cares about her patients. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and that we left feeling satisfied with our visit. I feel lucky to have found such a caring and compassionate pediatrician for my child, and I would highly recommend Dr. Bhargavi to anyone looking for a friendly and skilled pediatrician.",

We discussed how my daughter was feeling and Doctor gave us a good listening ear. She prescribed good medication. She was thorough and followed up the next day to check if my daughter was feeling better and I told her that yes, as a matter of fact she was. She showed great care and empathy not only for my child but also for me, a very concerned parent. I strongly recommend Dr Bhargavi Arun. Not many doctors today really bother to get to the heart of the problem..they just want to quickly close the discussion and move on to the next patient. But Dr. Bhargavi is different- SHE TRULY CARES. ",

She is very adorable for her nature and behaviour . I haVent seen someone who treats child like her own child. \n2. Listens your query in detail and explains you solutions with patience ( which general doctors don't do)\n3. If you got appointment at 6 . you will be meeting her at 6 thats for sure. She is punctual and respects our time .\n4. She don't prescribe  unnecessary medicines . suggest as per need which make us belive that she is not corporate doctor but pure children's doctor.\n\n\n",
