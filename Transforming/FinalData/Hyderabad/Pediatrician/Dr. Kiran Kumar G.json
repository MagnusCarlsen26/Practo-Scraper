He thoroughly explained the treatment plan, addressing all our concerns with patience and clarity. His expertise and attentive care played a pivotal role in Noorain's recovery.\n\nThanks to Dr. Kumar's diligent efforts, Noorain is now healthy and back to her normal self. We are deeply appreciative of his dedication and the excellent medical attention she received. I highly recommend Dr. Kiran Kumar to anyone in need of expert medical care.",
