My Son is 3 months old,  since few days  he is not able to take milk properly and crying most of the time when i try to feed him. We visited various hospitals like Fernandez, Rainbow but none of the doctors there were able to identify the issue.\n\nVery rarely we will see doctors spending time with patients  but Dr Uday is an exception he spent 30 mins with us and he went through each and every details of my son to get a better understanding of the issue.\n\nDr Uday thoroughly checked my son and confirmed my son has mild infection in the stomach which is causing him discomfort while taking milk. Dr Uday suggested few medicines for 5 days and assured us that he will take milk from the 2nd dose of medicine and to our surprise my son started taking milk from the 2nd dose of medicine. We could see lot of improvement in my son within 5 days and now my son is able to take milk without any issues.\n\nHatsoff to Dr Uday for his timely diagnose and treatment. ",

He has been extremely good at building bond with small kids and spends quality time both with the kids as well as the accompanying parent.

First of all the doctor does not take payments for vaccination through credit cards, he only accepts cash. Secondly, he started preaching the parents for not maintaining a single file for the baby with out listening or understanding out side of the story. We have recently relocated here in Hyderabad and so we have 2 files. ******** *** *** ** ******** * ** ***** *** ****** *** ****** *** **** * ************** He shouted on the baby for crying, while administering the vaccines, he asked us to hold the baby's hands and feet, he did not have any nurse or help in his chamber. Once the vaccines were given, the site was bleeding and the doctor denined us even a single piece of cotton to stop the blood. Not professional behavior **** ** *********** ************* Overall, I am never going back to Dr. Sahu again nor would I recommend any parent to do so. ",

My Son is 3 months old,  since few days  he is not able to take milk properly and crying most of the time when i try to feed him. We visited various hospitals like Fernandez, Rainbow but none of the doctors there were able to identify the issue.\n\nVery rarely we will see doctors spending time with patients  but Dr Uday is an exception he spent 30 mins with us and he went through each and every details of my son to get a better understanding of the issue.\n\nDr Uday thoroughly checked my son and confirmed my son has mild infection in the stomach which is causing him discomfort while taking milk. Dr Uday suggested few medicines for 5 days and assured us that he will take milk from the 2nd dose of medicine and to our surprise my son started taking milk from the 2nd dose of medicine. We could see lot of improvement in my son within 5 days and now my son is able to take milk without any issues.\n\nHatsoff to Dr Uday for his timely diagnose and treatment. ",

First of all the doctor does not take payments for vaccination through credit cards, he only accepts cash. Secondly, he started preaching the parents for not maintaining a single file for the baby with out listening or understanding out side of the story. We have recently relocated here in Hyderabad and so we have 2 files. ******** *** *** ** ******** * ** ***** *** ****** *** ****** *** **** * ************** He shouted on the baby for crying, while administering the vaccines, he asked us to hold the baby's hands and feet, he did not have any nurse or help in his chamber. Once the vaccines were given, the site was bleeding and the doctor denined us even a single piece of cotton to stop the blood. Not professional behavior **** ** *********** ************* Overall, I am never going back to Dr. Sahu again nor would I recommend any parent to do so. ",

You were accommodated and seen from 7:09 pm to 7:24 pm; a total of 15 minutes,which is the standard norm of clinic according to Ptacto. A through examination was done and vaccinations were given after finding no medical contraindications . On your previous visit you had encouragingly commented in my visitor book \" patient hearing good diagnosis\". I appreciate your gesture. In this clinic the vaccines are dispensed and not sold, so you got a total receipt. If you have any doubt, you can verify the rate on internet. I apologise for not coming upto your expectation. I shall improve.",
