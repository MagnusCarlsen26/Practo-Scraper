I was being operated by two doctors in Manju hospitals .And one of them was Dr. Prashanth. This was the first time ever i had met with such an accident and i had given up all hopes . But he calmed me down ,assured me everything will be fine. Xrays and various reports were being taken and i had to be operated . And i had two plates and screws fixed . I was under doctors observations for 3 to 4 days . And after which i was discharged . I had a cast for almost 4 weeks and i was asked to rest . After which it was removed and then i was being asked to walk by putting 25% weight initially and slowly increasing it gradually. I am still recovering. But i am very much happy with entire process of treatment and guidance that i got from Dr. Prashanth. He is very knowledegable and helpful. And he is always ready to clear your doubts abt ur bone healing process or any other issues. I would definitely like to recommend him to more n more atients like me . ** ** *** ** *** **** *********** ******* * **** **** ***. Thank u doctor. ",
