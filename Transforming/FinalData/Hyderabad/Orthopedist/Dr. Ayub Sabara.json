For her age, the normal progression of recovery to normal unassisted walking can take up to 1 year \nMoreover, Dr Ayub  is a very polite doctor with a human healing touch, making the patient cheerful and reassured\nI conclude by asserting that our landing with Dr Ayub was fortuitous and auspicious \nGod bless DrAyub\n",
