"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Joint Replacement Surgery,Lateral Epicondyle Release (Tennis Elbow),",0,0,YES,"I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Madhu Kiran, who is not only a friendly doctor but also treats patients with exceptional care. Recently, I experienced his expertise firsthand when he quickly resolved my Tennis Elbow issue. My wife also received excellent treatment for severe back pain, resulting in a complete recovery.

Most importantly, my mother, who had suffered from severe leg pains for the past 10 years and spent a lot of money without relief, found hope with Dr. Madhu Kiran. His clear explanation of her condition and the confidence he instilled in her led her to agree to a joint replacement surgery, which was a resounding success. My mother is now fully recovered and thriving.

Thank you so much, Dr. Madhu Kiran. We are deeply grateful for your exceptional care and wish you continued success in your practice.",2024-05-29 05:06:12,False,True,Aditya ,,,
