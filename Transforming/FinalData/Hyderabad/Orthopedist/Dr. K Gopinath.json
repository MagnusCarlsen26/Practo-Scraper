His treatment procedures include minimum and only essential medicines, and his explanations for the ailment that the patient is suffering through are simple that are understood by the patient. His friendly nature makes patients believe that they are in safe hands. He is more than a family doctor for us, rather I would say that he has become an inseparable part of my family now. I'm always grateful that he's been very supportive throughout my disease journey. Thank you very much, Dr. Gopinath, for making me survive without any health problems now.",

It actually effects both doctor and patient. \n\nPatients and their caretaker come at the designated time, but due to urgency, or see other patients, he forget that he need to attend attend or treat the patients in the treatment area while doing consultation. \n\nThey wait for hours and hours from morning till evening just to have a 15-30 minutues of his time.  He could have informed them earlier about the delay in advance or every 2 hours or regular intervals, he could take 30 min off and treat the earlier patients.  \n\nWe understand his time is precious and had to attend when emergency comes and leave the rest...but not this way.   Was little disappointed with this mis-management of such renowned doctor. ",

His treatment procedures include minimum and only essential medicines, and his explanations for the ailment that the patient is suffering through are simple that are understood by the patient. His friendly nature makes patients believe that they are in safe hands. He is more than a family doctor for us, rather I would say that he has become an inseparable part of my family now. I'm always grateful that he's been very supportive throughout my disease journey. Thank you very much, Dr. Gopinath, for making me survive without any health problems now.",

It actually effects both doctor and patient. \n\nPatients and their caretaker come at the designated time, but due to urgency, or see other patients, he forget that he need to attend attend or treat the patients in the treatment area while doing consultation. \n\nThey wait for hours and hours from morning till evening just to have a 15-30 minutues of his time.  He could have informed them earlier about the delay in advance or every 2 hours or regular intervals, he could take 30 min off and treat the earlier patients.  \n\nWe understand his time is precious and had to attend when emergency comes and leave the rest...but not this way.   Was little disappointed with this mis-management of such renowned doctor. ",
