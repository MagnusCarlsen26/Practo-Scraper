"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","ACL &PCL Reconstruction,",0,0,YES,"I visited Doctor for ACL reconstruction and meniscus surgery.
I had torn ACL and visited few Doctors for ACL reconstruction surgery. Did online research and with reference from distant friends, met Dr. Prabhat. After carefully listening to the problem and the surgical procedure, finally decided to go with Dr. Prabhat. He explained  everything for all my questions (some very silly questions as well), and got confidence after meeting and talking to him.  My observations are - he is very patient, friendly and care for patients.  

After all the  pre-tests and formalities and insurance approvals, I got my surgery done on  22nd Apr 2019.  I was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day and discharged on the same day. Met the doctor again on 10 May 2019 for stitches removal.  I went to meet Dr for consultation by walking with knee brace support from hospital entrance. 
I started walking without walker and brace immediately after few days from then. For Physiotherapy I used the 3rd party services initaially. When I met next time after a month for consultation, he is not happy with the progress and suggested me to take help from the Physio who works for him and gave his improvement suggestions to Physio.
Next time when i met after 2 months, The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress. Its almost 9 months since surgrey done and didnt face any issues. 

Venkat who is support staff, was very helpful for all the appointments and scheduling my surgery. Rohit, Phsio, did my physiotherapy and helped me to recover fast!

I strongly suggest Dr. Prabhat for all ACL surgeries and consultation!

Thank you Dr!

HAPPY KNEE. In the view of negative feedback given by one of my patients parent two months back, I wish to discuss about MONEY AND ETHICS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. And DETERIORATING OPINION ON DOCTORS.
I see an average 30-40patients a day which around 6000/year. If 8 out of 6000 give me a negative feedback, I don’t worry as mostly are about delays in clinic which are beyond my control during an emergency case. But even if one patient comments about about my MEDICAL ETHICS, that hurts me and make me look into my inner conscious and question myself “am I the unethical person the lady is taking about.” 
I will give an example of how PATIENTS INTERPRET DECISION MAKING.
I saw a 12year old child with knee dislocation. Scan shows ligament tear which needs surgery. If you go for a second opinion, there is very fair chance the doctor won’t agree with surgical decision as we know that most patients coming second opinion don’t want surgery at that point. Does this mean that first date is unethical ? Of course I see on a daily basis where surgery was wrongly suggested when there is absolutely no indication. 
KNEE LIGAMENT INJURIES NEED SURGERY NOT TO IMPROVE PAIN, but to prevent any instability in future which when untreated leads to arthritis in joint over 5years. So if you treat a ACL TEAR  patient without surgery, he will walk again in properly in few weeks. That doesn’t mean surgery is not required at all.  Most  people slowly damage the joint because of knee jerking with every step and worse with running or playing sports. How do I make patient understand the long term issues. 
I operate some knee ligament injuries immediately after injury and some even 4-5 years after the ligament tear. The difference between those two cases  is the damage done to joint in patients who have delayed surgery. 
So QUESTIONING ETHICALITY OF A GOOD DOCTOR IS WRONG.  We study close to 30years to understand the intricacies in decision making. How can a person judge a doctor  based on information gathered in few minutes from google or from another doctor ? 
Please question yourself, before posting demoralising statements.",2020-02-03T16:55:50+0000,Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi

My rule of ethics which I strictly adhere-
1. Diagnose the condition
2. Given them treatment options
3. If surgery is the best option, then I wait for patient to ask me how much it cost for surgery
4. Only after patient understands surgery will help, then we ask them if they have pay for their treatment or insurance. 
Under no circumstance either me or my junior consultants or my staff should enquire about insurance. 
If I reach a stage where money will drive me, then I think I will certainly consider looking another job. I always believed and taught my juniors,” do the best for your patients, money will come”, in a span of 40years of medical practice , we all can make decent money, but that shouldn’t be the driving force.
