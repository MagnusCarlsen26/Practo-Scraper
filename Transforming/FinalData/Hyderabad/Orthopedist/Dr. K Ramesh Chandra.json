The consultation fee is quite reasonable and he rather desisted me to go for the avoidable screenings and other related tests and rather focused on ground breaking physio therapy treatment, which is a fair indicator that he is more patient centric in addressing their problems and not otherwise.moreover I would equally appreciate the physiotherapist referred by him in the same hospital. they are equally awesome. they are exceptionally well in their services and strike at the roots of the problem. I really liked how meticulously they give ear to each of the details shared by you with them. the facilities at the site and the overall ambience is worth mentioning and gives you a soothingly vibes. Overall, I could cut a feeling that I was in the safe hands.my best wishes to the hospital and all of their team members for a great success.",

The consultation fee is quite reasonable and he rather desisted me to go for the avoidable screenings and other related tests and rather focused on ground breaking physio therapy treatment, which is a fair indicator that he is more patient centric in addressing their problems and not otherwise.moreover I would equally appreciate the physiotherapist referred by him in the same hospital. they are equally awesome. they are exceptionally well in their services and strike at the roots of the problem. I really liked how meticulously they give ear to each of the details shared by you with them. the facilities at the site and the overall ambience is worth mentioning and gives you a soothingly vibes. Overall, I could cut a feeling that I was in the safe hands.my best wishes to the hospital and all of their team members for a great success.",
