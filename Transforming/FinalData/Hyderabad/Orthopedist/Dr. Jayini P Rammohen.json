This is exactly where Dr. Jayini P Rammohen excels. He not only listen to you patiently about each and every minute detail of your problem but will also give you detailed explanation about your condition. \n\nAfter I was told that I needed a shoulder surgery for Bankart lesion, I consulted a lot of doctors to verify whether I actually needed a surgery or not. Although every doctor\u2019s diagnosis were same, it was only when I met Dr Jayini, I was fully confident about going for the surgery. \n\nI was beyond impressed with my experience at Dr. Rammohen\u2019s office. I find that doctors usually are distracted or rushed when visiting their patients, but not with Dr. Rammohen. He gave full attention even for my post-op visits and would patiently listen to all my worries and the progress I made. I had the sense that my doctor REALLY cared about my whole being and not just the fact that I needed a physical exam and some other work done. We also discussed vitamin supplements and he made recommendations as to what I need.  He even helped dealing with the insurance which is not at all his job, really keeps no stone unturned when it comes to looking after his patient. Also, despite having a busy practice, I\u2019m almost always able to schedule an appt.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Rammohen to anyone that values their health and wants a doctor that\u2019s holistic, empowering, and a true team player! **** ** ********* ************* *** ********** ********** *** ** *** **** ******* **********",

She told me another doctor is 10 yrs experience but when I checked in practo, he was 4 yrs of experience. I waited for him also for more than half an hour. Then also the same staff told me that it will take more time for him to come. I requested to refund the money. By the time another staff talked to Dr Jayini in front of me and told me that he is not feeling well and will not visit the Hospital today. This was a shock to me because already the previous staff told me that he is in emergency surgery. They asked me to come next day to receive the check in which they will deduct registration fees and the 15%(as I paid through debit card). Nobody was concerned and I was calling again and again to confirm the mode of payment. When I went next day to receive the check, they told me as it is a small amount so we will pay you through cash. They should have given me the amount same day instead of wasting my time to revisit. I did not got chance to meet any doctor for these 3 days and the behavior of the staff in Pace Hospital is very indifferent and lot of inconvenience is caused to me because of them. They should have closed the slot in Practo if the doctor is not available in first case.",

The reason for writing this review is to benefit the patients not the doctor. Because it is important for a patient to find the right and genuine doctor in this competitive environment. \nComing to Dr. Jayini P Rammohen, I had visited him at Revive clinic in lingampally initially and later at Pace hospital for treatment of my mother and also my wife. He politely listened to them explained what went wrong and what needs to be done. ** *** ***** *** **** ********* ****** Above all he gives lot of confidence to the patient. I am not giving the details of treatment here but I wanted to underline that he is more focused on accurate diagnosis of the problem and giving the right medication to correct that, which makes the doctor great. He correlated different tests results and explained the possible reasons for that. In addition the physiotherapists who worked under him are well qualified and trained by the doctor. Doctor is compassionate and  empathetic to the patient needs. He also suggested the places for fitness equipment where I can get at an affordable price. He is passionate towards his profession but not the money. Please keep up the great spirit sir. Thank you. ",

I am a 25-year-old male, when I was 17 years old I had a basketball injury that led to a ligament tear in my right knee. I was never able to treat it since then because no doctors could detect it. Everywhere I go they used to give me some ointments and send me back home. I was under the impression that I have knee pains because I was overweight. When I moved to Hyderabad, a\u00a0similar thing happened to me once again. my knee used to hurt when I was hitting the gym. I went to doctor Jayani, he listened to my story, asked me to walk, he observed my walk, just my walk. without any physical contact or examination, he said, \"How are you even able to walk, your ligament is torn. Your leg wobbles when you take steps\". I was shocked to hear that. I mean it's a 7-year-old injury, I might have consulted 4-5 doctors since then and none of them told me that this might be something bigger than just an overweight knee pain issue. \nLast year I got my knee operated by Dr. Jayani. It's been over 16 months and never ever have I looked back since. Thanks, Doctor Jayani!! You are truly amazing!",

This is exactly where Dr. Jayini P Rammohen excels. He not only listen to you patiently about each and every minute detail of your problem but will also give you detailed explanation about your condition. \n\nAfter I was told that I needed a shoulder surgery for Bankart lesion, I consulted a lot of doctors to verify whether I actually needed a surgery or not. Although every doctor\u2019s diagnosis were same, it was only when I met Dr Jayini, I was fully confident about going for the surgery. \n\nI was beyond impressed with my experience at Dr. Rammohen\u2019s office. I find that doctors usually are distracted or rushed when visiting their patients, but not with Dr. Rammohen. He gave full attention even for my post-op visits and would patiently listen to all my worries and the progress I made. I had the sense that my doctor REALLY cared about my whole being and not just the fact that I needed a physical exam and some other work done. We also discussed vitamin supplements and he made recommendations as to what I need.  He even helped dealing with the insurance which is not at all his job, really keeps no stone unturned when it comes to looking after his patient. Also, despite having a busy practice, I\u2019m almost always able to schedule an appt.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Rammohen to anyone that values their health and wants a doctor that\u2019s holistic, empowering, and a true team player! **** ** ********* ************* *** ********** ********** *** ** *** **** ******* **********",

Next day when I reached Pace Hospital, after waiting for half an hour, one of the staff told me that the doctor had to go for an emergency surgery and asked me to come after 2 hrs or meet another orthopedic. She told me another doctor is 10 yrs experience but when I checked in practo, he was 4 yrs of experience. I waited for him also for more than half an hour. Then also the same staff told me that it will take more time for him to come. I requested to refund the money. By the time another staff talked to Dr Jayini in front of me and told me that he is not feeling well and will not visit the Hospital today. This was a shock to me because already the previous staff told me that he is in emergency surgery. They asked me to come next day to receive the check in which they will deduct registration fees and the 15%(as I paid through debit card). Nobody was concerned and I was calling again and again to confirm the mode of payment. When I went next day to receive the check, they told me as it is a small amount so we will pay you through cash. They should have given me the amount same day instead of wasting my time to revisit. I did not got chance to meet any doctor for these 3 days and the behavior of the staff in Pace Hospital is very indifferent and lot of inconvenience is caused to me because of them. They should have closed the slot in Practo if the doctor is not available in first case.",

He politely listened to them explained what went wrong and what needs to be done. ** *** ***** *** **** ********* ****** Above all he gives lot of confidence to the patient. I am not giving the details of treatment here but I wanted to underline that he is more focused on accurate diagnosis of the problem and giving the right medication to correct that, which makes the doctor great. He correlated different tests results and explained the possible reasons for that. In addition the physiotherapists who worked under him are well qualified and trained by the doctor. Doctor is compassionate and  empathetic to the patient needs. He also suggested the places for fitness equipment where I can get at an affordable price. He is passionate towards his profession but not the money. Please keep up the great spirit sir. Thank you. ",

I am a 25-year-old male, when I was 17 years old I had a basketball injury that led to a ligament tear in my right knee. I was never able to treat it since then because no doctors could detect it. Everywhere I go they used to give me some ointments and send me back home. I was under the impression that I have knee pains because I was overweight. When I moved to Hyderabad, a\u00a0similar thing happened to me once again. my knee used to hurt when I was hitting the gym. I went to doctor Jayani, he listened to my story, asked me to walk, he observed my walk, just my walk. without any physical contact or examination, he said, \"How are you even able to walk, your ligament is torn. Your leg wobbles when you take steps\". I was shocked to hear that. I mean it's a 7-year-old injury, I might have consulted 4-5 doctors since then and none of them told me that this might be something bigger than just an overweight knee pain issue. \nLast year I got my knee operated by Dr. Jayani. It's been over 16 months and never ever have I looked back since. Thanks, Doctor Jayani!! You are truly amazing!",

My pain got relief from Day 1 and as soon as I start  Physiotherapy in the same hospital my pain was gradually decreased.\nFinally after 4 days of treatment 80% of my problem is solved. I fly back to Saudi Arabia with proper guidance both from Dr. Jayini and Dr. Manjula (Physiotherapy). Doctors suggested me to continue the workouts which I am doing and my pain is greatly reduced.\nThe close relatives and friends who saw me before treatment and after are wondered by the great recovery. \nI really thank to Dr. Jayini, Dr. Manjula for their support and treatment. I suggested the hospital to my relatives and friends.",

With expertise in the field of Ortho, the Doctor has treated PCL avulsion injury without surgery.  As we all are aware of the fact that most of  the doctors will go for surgery in such cases. Awesome.  \nOnly after an years review the doctor went for ACL reconstruction surgery.  ******* ** ** ** *** ** *** ****  ******* ** ***** ** *****  He is safe and very good hand in getting treated.\nI extend my heartful thanks to Dr.Jayini P.Rammohen for using his vast experience and enormous patience in treating my son.\nHis care before and after operation is appealing.\nI once again thank Dr.Jayini P.Rammohen for successful treatment, Dr. Thota Shalini for introducing Pace Hospitals.\nMy special thanks to Dr.Govind Verma for everything.\n\nRegards\nS.PRAVEEN CHANDRA",

We came all the way from Vizag for my severe backpain in Jan 17 to Hyderabad, from our point of view probably he is the only Doctor who can find the exact root cause of back pain within my first impression (visit), and after using his medication and treatment, now I feel relaxed and happy from the pain (not to forget this is subject to regular physio exercises and ergonomics during his medication). Thank you Doctor for all your support !! Srinivasa and Swati from Vizag.",

Doctors used to give pain relievers or suggested steroid injections but as soon as medication was stopped, pain started to amplify. But consulting Dr. Jayini P Rammohan was a blessing to our family.  He is so patient while listening our issues, he tries to build confidence level of the patient. He examined my mother\u2019s case history thoroughly and tried to target the root cause of the problem. Also he did not prescribe unnecessary medicines or tests. In just 3 months by using suggested medication, undergoing physiotherapy and doing strengthening exercises sincerely, her pain has got relived so much. I strongly recommend him for lower back pain without second thoughts.",

Neither does he force you to take expensive medical tests like Vitamin D, Calcium, etc. He is also very friendly and you will develop an instant connect with him.

NOTE: suggestion for a surgery is based upon your problem . So if it's still there better go for surgery.",

After having an xray, doctor said it is fractured however it is level 1 sprain and gave meditation. Along with that he also suggested/demonstrated exercise that I need to after my swelling is reduced. Doctor also suggested for Vitamin D, B12 and Calcium test, which came out as deficient for me. I am currently getting vitamin shots. I am extremely satisfied and thank doctor jayani..!! \n\nA big thank you to the extremely polite and skilled staff of the clinic!! :)",

I waited for 90mins , even after that also they were that my turn will come after 2 more patients. Finally I had to leave the place n visit another doctor.",

There is lots of difference between 15 days of treatment of another doctors and 3 days of Dr. Jayini's treatment.Consultation fee and test costs are a bit high, but in areas like Kothaguda/Kondapur/Gachibowli/Hitech, where the cost of living is pretty much high, theres no such preference except health when it can be treated in such a good way, money comes later.",

I reached befkre time and staff informed me that dr is at lunch and would come in 20 mins.\nThey made me sit ouside. And when doctor came they didnt even inform that dr is back. I went to see doctor and staff would not find my file that i gave 10 mins back. Instead of finding themselves they made me go to reception n look. Doctor went to pharmaxy for 10 mins leaving patients outside. I waited 45 mins.\nMy apt was at 3 and i met dr at 3:50.\nDoctor was not very friendly. He doesnt even greet people. Treatment ans suggestions were ok.",

I am now 69 was not able even to raise my hands. I have consulted few orthopedists at Pune and spent considerable amount of money and time towards treatments but no relief at all from pain. Finally, under this worrying condition, one of my friends advised me to consult Dr Jayini Rammohen and it was in June'18 first week I took appointment of Dr Jayini Rammohen and met him. It took hardly 5 minutes for him to identify the problem and prescribe D vitamin plus physiotherapy for 5 days. One may not believe that after 5 days of the above treatment, the pain in my shoulders totally disappeared and I started doing all tough asanas ie sirsasana (headstand pose), sarvangasana etc etc and it's a miracle that has happened. Coming to Dr Jayini Rammohen, I found him very friendly, noble, highly professional besides being thorough in quickly identifying the problem of the patient. His professional and communicative skills to explain the problem of the patient are exemplary. All the supporting staff in Pace Hospital are very friendly and highly cooperative. I feel much privileged to be a patient of Dr Jayini Rammohen and it's a boon that such super speciality hospital exists in Hitech city. ",

After thorough examination he prescribed medicine unlike other doctors who immediately start writing costly tests without depending upon their physical diagnosis. He explained to us in detail what the problem is and the course of treatment he is going to follow. \r\nHe asked us to take a x Ray only because we were coming from far away place to reduce our burden of visiting him in short time. \r\nIt is very rare now a days to find a doctor who gives patient hearing even after shelving huge amount of money and spending our time. I strongly recommend Dr Mohen to all. ",

Starting first aid, counselling and  until surgery he was very considerate and it was all smooth. Now after 3 months my hand feel almost normal. One thing where he stands out is he does not care much about money, which is very uncommon these days. Hopefully at some point of time, removal of plate will be as smooth. Thank You Doctor!!",

I was surprised by this and didn't take the Vitamin D test, forget about the injections. I know Vitamin D is required for proper ortho functioning, but i'm better off getting it from sun :).",

He'd suggest lifestyle changes that are leading to weak-joints or frequent sprains.\n\nHe actually asked my friend to squat in clinic to check his posture and eventually ended up correcting his posture for relief from incessant knee pain. In another story, he sent my mom away without any prescription when she had to visit the doctor for pain in old ankle injuries. He just recommended new shoes for full recovery. In both cases, his treatment was of permanent nature and symptoms never repeated.\n\nHe's very honest, explains everything really well and will target the problem at root cause without raising any unnecessary alarms. Highly recommended. ",

As I didn't able to control my pain, he suggested MRI Lunar Spine, and thank god, the report suggests that everything was fine except small muscle spasms and minor disc bulging.
