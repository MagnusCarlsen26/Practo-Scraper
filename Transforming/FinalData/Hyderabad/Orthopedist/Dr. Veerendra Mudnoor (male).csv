"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Therapy,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Veerendra is one of the most experienced doctor I would personally recommend. I had a disc slip in my cervix way back in 2014. I wasn't aware of his existence. So when I went to Mythri Hospital in Chandanagar, I was referred to him. He made an excellent diagnosis and started with step by step medication. Though I had an acute pain however he didn't jump into conclusion that it was a disc slip. Through step by step medication he diagnosed the right problem and made me cure in 2 months. My condition was serious when I first met him. However he didn't hurry up. Instead he did a thorough diagnosis to identify the root cause of the problem and got me recover. My friends who had similar cases ended up in surgery which I didn't. Today also I refer my family and friends to him for any orthopedic issues. My sincere gratitude and heartfelt thanks to him for being always available to take care of us.",2021-06-17 09:55:36,False,True,Shubhankar Bhattacharya,,,
