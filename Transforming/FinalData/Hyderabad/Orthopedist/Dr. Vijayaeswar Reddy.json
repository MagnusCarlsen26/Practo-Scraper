He is very polite and has lot of patience to listen to every information from the patient. He had recommended lab tests that were only necessary to be done and provided genuine medicines for the problem. He is easily reachable through phone and last but not the least the charges are not expensive.\n\nI would highly recommend the Doctor to anyone looking for Orthopedic problems.",
