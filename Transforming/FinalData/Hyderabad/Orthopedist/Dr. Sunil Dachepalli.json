                "review_text": "Writing a review for this doctor is very difficult to be expressed in words but still i would share my story here with this doctor.I got to know about this doctor from one of my family doctor in Kolkata.So as i was not in Hyderabad i mailed this doctor about my mom's right knee pain with her previous medical prescriptions and x-rays. After he saw that mail we had a telecommunications and i got confidence on this doctor and book a flight to hyderabad from Kolkata with my parents. After examining my Mom thoroughly and doing some tests he suggested total knee replacement for my Mom, but we got very scared as per some other relatives comments who had done their surgery somewhere else and operation was not successful. When i shared their story with this doctor he directly sent me to a patient whome he had just operated 2 weeks back and came to hospital on that day for stitch removal. So we went to that gentleman and took his very good reviews on the operation done by this doctor and he was also able to move and bend his leg for a full flexion just after 2 weeks of his both knee replacement done. The doctor also sent us to a patient in ot recovery room who was walking first time just after 4 hours  of his knee t replacement done.After seeing all this we got confidence and went for a total knee replacement surgery for my Mom s right knee. After the operation doctor made her walk just after 4 hours of her surgery and from next day her Physiotherapy got started in the hospital. The highest pain for my Mom after the surgery was 3 out of 10, that too after doing Physiotherapy ,which was quite less for her rather than previous knee pain.\n\nNow it has been 2 weeks and my mom is now walking without any Walker support. She also went upstairs just at the second day of her operation. Now her painkiller is also just paracetamol and no heavy painkiller is prescribed to her still she won't be complaining about any pain to me even after her Physiotherapy.\n\nIt is actually my mom's words to every person who is having a knee pain and need a knee replacement but not doing so by thinking that it may get failed and tolerating this pain they all should go to this doctor and made this operation done by him if needed.\n\nIn a word i can tell this doctor is the most transparent, responsive, helpful , friendly person in this earth i have ever met as a doctor.*** ***** *** ***** ******* *** ** * **** **** ** ** ********* ** *** *** *** ****** ** *****",

After he saw that mail we had a telecommunications and i got confidence on this doctor and book a flight to hyderabad from Kolkata with my parents. After examining my Mom thoroughly and doing some tests he suggested total knee replacement for my Mom, but we got very scared as per some other relatives comments who had done their surgery somewhere else and operation was not successful. When i shared their story with this doctor he directly sent me to a patient whome he had just operated 2 weeks back and came to hospital on that day for stitch removal. So we went to that gentleman and took his very good reviews on the operation done by this doctor and he was also able to move and bend his leg for a full flexion just after 2 weeks of his both knee replacement done. The doctor also sent us to a patient in ot recovery room who was walking first time just after 4 hours  of his knee t replacement done.After seeing all this we got confidence and went for a total knee replacement surgery for my Mom s right knee. After the operation doctor made her walk just after 4 hours of her surgery and from next day her Physiotherapy got started in the hospital. The highest pain for my Mom after the surgery was 3 out of 10, that too after doing Physiotherapy ,which was quite less for her rather than previous knee pain.\n\nNow it has been 2 weeks and my mom is now walking without any Walker support. She also went upstairs just at the second day of her operation. Now her painkiller is also just paracetamol and no heavy painkiller is prescribed to her still she won't be complaining about any pain to me even after her Physiotherapy.\n\nIt is actually my mom's words to every person who is having a knee pain and need a knee replacement but not doing so by thinking that it may get failed and tolerating this pain they all should go to this doctor and made this operation done by him if needed.\n\nIn a word i can tell this doctor is the most transparent, responsive, helpful , friendly person in this earth i have ever met as a doctor.*** ***** *** ***** ******* *** ** * **** **** ** ** ********* ** *** *** *** ****** ** *****",

Patiently listens to the problems. Others orthopedics simply say do exercises but sir will personally show you how to do the exercise.\nAs I trust only him I again visited Sunil sir for my knee pain, he checked in his ways and said there is no problem he gave me medicines for 15days, now my knee is fine. Honestly I suggest everyone who have any orthopedic issues mist visit this doctor once.",

I met sunil @ innovate clinic and just because of his diagnosis I understood that I have minor francture . he has suffered some medicines and fitness activities I need to follow for speed recover and they worked well .. . My wife has pain in joints and we consulted many doctors but no one diagnosed what was wrong .!! We met sunil last month and she is perfect now ...

He genuinely cares about his patients well-being and recovery. My son has very fast recovery and he was comfortable after the two days of surgery.Previously he  has undergone the same to the left knee with another doctor but took 15 days for recovery.

Recently at work I have had to carry a heavy weight laptop back and forth, I walk a kilometer with it everyday, and my shoulders hurt and i was afraid that I would worsen the cramps in my shoulders and i went to the docter to get a certificate so i can either take a light weight computer or a trolley instead of a bag. ( as a safety net before can earn the money needed to strengthen my shoulders) I paid for the consultation, but never got a certificate, as the doctor assumed and berated me for behaving like an old woman etc... He never listened to the issue.   He kept going on about wanting me to get back to normal life as if i dont want that.. As a  single woman living alone, I do everything i can to be strong enough to carry out my daily chores, and the docter had no right to judge, berate me. He wasted my money, my time and broke my trust.",

When we were planning to do total knee replacement of both legs of my wife, literally we were full with confusion as well as risk. We asked many individuals regarding this treatment, some are successful some are not. \nWhen we met Dr Sunil. His confidence regarding total knee replacement was so high. After 1st meeting itself we decided for total knee replacement for both legs. He is not only a great doctor but also a remarkable person. His behavior and politeness is fantastic. Here I'll add other supportive doctors also, all are very generous and caring. Added one more doctor name Dr Anusha, She is like very close to every patient. Her carness and behavior is like family person.\nThen we were afraid of doing knee replacement for both legs within a period of 15 days. But now even we can't believe that all the operation and treatment has accomplished. \nIt is like miracle, only because of Dr Sunil ; Yoshada Hospital- Samajiguda.\nNow we are much satisfied with treatment.\nThank you for your service.",

I met Dr. Sunil along with my friend for his father's knee replacement consultation. I was impressed by the way he talks and makes the patient very comfortable. Very rarely you would see someone with good skills and knowledge.  Here is the reason for my statement\n\nAfter few months i did visit him for ankle related issues and he tracked out that due to ligament tear I've started putting weight and pressure on my left leg. He gave me confidence to go under knife and it helped me also after that i've lost about 12kgs and feeling young and fresh. \n\nLater i've taken my aunt and uncle for knee replacements both were happy. All my interactions and insurgencies under him went well.\n\nThanks Dr.DC keep smiling.",

I am surprised to see your comment about referring to specific diagnostic centres. I usually ask everybody where they live and suggest places closer to them, I do not have personal interest in any of the diagnostic centres. But I suggest some places which are not worth your money if you ask for those centres. After having vast Orthopaedic experience ( Almost 19 plus years) I try to investigate if required. If I can't diagnose your condition the first time and keep asking you to visit me again and again, I don't think it's convenient for you. I can only treat appropriately based on the correct diagnosis rather than giving you blanket medication. If you still feel that you didn't get appropriate management , you can have free consultation again.",
