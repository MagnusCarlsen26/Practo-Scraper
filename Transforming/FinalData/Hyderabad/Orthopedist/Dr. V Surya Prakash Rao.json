She was in a lot of pain and was hardly able to walk.\nDr Surya took ample time to walk both her and me through the issue. He explained how this could be resolved with physiotherapy and exercise. He strongly advised against surgery and explained that the pain is temporary and is only due to inflammation.\nHe also has a great sense of humour, even my mom was so happy after meeting him. He set her mind at ease and she was already feeling better right after walking out of his chamber.\nIt has been 5 days since she started physiotherapy and she's already walking with a spring in her step and is even able to climb stairs.\nThank you so much Sir! We are blessed to have you as my mum's doctor",

Surgery was the only option but due to her old age backbone surgery was too risky as per doctors, family and friends. We lost all hopes before i went through the reviews of Dr. V Surya Prakash Rao and consulted him. In the first meeting itself he was confident to cure my mother through a painless surgery. Just one hour after the surgery my mother was able to walk and now today she is able to walk without any support too. The patient gets 50% cured before the surgery itself by his warm behaviour.  A Great Doctor , Great human being and God.",

Hospital staff were after money and pushing us for operation when my father was severely critical  - acute sepsis with multiple organ dysfunction and sever back pain. He was persistent on not needing for an operation immediately but instead recover through better immunity build up and less meds. over the course of 15 months my father took meds and we noticed many sideeffects including peripheral arthritis and blindness, I recall a time when my father was not able to see anything and Dr Surya Prakash replied to my email spontaneously and we could see positive signs with his eyesight within a week. We have so much faith on him that we didn't see any General physician or pulmunologist after 5 months of treatment as they were mostly after visiting fees or otherwise confusing. On the other hand Dr Surya Prakash was highly professional and asked to pay visit only after 6 months and gradually but surely we saw the progress. My father is now recovering quick, he is no longer in bed, moving around and doing house work at ease. A lot of credit goes to this experienced and sincere doctor for handling the case with sensitivity and with the sole aim of helping the patient. ",

He strongly advised against surgery and explained that the pain is temporary and is only due to inflammation.\nHe also has a great sense of humour, even my mom was so happy after meeting him. He set her mind at ease and she was already feeling better right after walking out of his chamber.\nIt has been 5 days since she started physiotherapy and she's already walking with a spring in her step and is even able to climb stairs.\nThank you so much Sir!

Just one hour after the surgery my mother was able to walk and now today she is able to walk without any support too. The patient gets 50% cured before the surgery itself by his warm behaviour.

Hospital staff were after money and pushing us for operation when my father was severely critical  - acute sepsis with multiple organ dysfunction and sever back pain. He was persistent on not needing for an operation immediately but instead recover through better immunity build up and less meds. over the course of 15 months my father took meds and we noticed many sideeffects including peripheral arthritis and blindness, I recall a time when my father was not able to see anything and Dr Surya Prakash replied to my email spontaneously and we could see positive signs with his eyesight within a week. We have so much faith on him that we didn't see any General physician or pulmunologist after 5 months of treatment as they were mostly after visiting fees or otherwise confusing. On the other hand Dr Surya Prakash was highly professional and asked to pay visit only after 6 months and gradually but surely we saw the progress. My father is now recovering quick, he is no longer in bed, moving around and doing house work at ease. A lot of credit goes to this experienced and sincere doctor for handling the case with sensitivity and with the sole aim of helping the patient. ",
