Once I reach there he immediately took XRAY but the XRAY was very badly taken, it was all black, and he never explain me any thing regarding my problem. Straight away by seeing that black xray he diagnosed that I was having a hairline fracture and have to do plaster on my left ankle region. I was in tremendous pain so without thinking for a second I obliged. he did  the plaster but with in hours the plaster went loose, when I called him saying the plaster is getting loose he said it's okay. After a week the plaster is broken badly, when I called him again he said that is not a problem. like wise the day came when he is suppose to remove the plaster. on that day after removal of the plaster I felt uneasiness on that region which I was feeling for quite some time now and informed the same to the doctor. To my surprise he advised me to get an MRI scan done as he was doubtful what could have been went wrong. I was really frustrated and left immediately. Even now also I feel uneasiness on my ankle area. I consulted another renowned  doctor with all XRAY and prescription, he was really shocked seeing the black XRAY and told me he didn't understand how based on that xray some one could treat a patient. Later he advised me to do another xray and after that it was found that for the hair line fracture the way the plaster has been done, the healing was not proper and for that the bone shape got bigger and hence the uneasiness. I would not recommend this doctor to anybody. I don't know how in practo he is getting that good rating.",

But they again took the consultation fee of RS 200 , even after spending nearly RS 5000 on X-ray and treatment. This was not so for the other doctor ( orthopedic) , whom I had visited for the same bone fracture issue of my nephew. By charging consultation fee ,again and again just by citing trivial reason like , previous consultation is for only 7 days even after taking full treatment with them is definitely losing the trust and good will of the patients in my  opinion. I strictly recommend the hospital management to consider the policy of charging consultation fee , who took complete treatment with them for certain period like minimum 1 month.",

Once I reach there he immediately took XRAY but the XRAY was very badly taken, it was all black, and he never explain me any thing regarding my problem. Straight away by seeing that black xray he diagnosed that I was having a hairline fracture and have to do plaster on my left ankle region. I was in tremendous pain so without thinking for a second I obliged. he did  the plaster but with in hours the plaster went loose, when I called him saying the plaster is getting loose he said it's okay. After a week the plaster is broken badly, when I called him again he said that is not a problem. like wise the day came when he is suppose to remove the plaster. on that day after removal of the plaster I felt uneasiness on that region which I was feeling for quite some time now and informed the same to the doctor. To my surprise he advised me to get an MRI scan done as he was doubtful what could have been went wrong. I was really frustrated and left immediately. Even now also I feel uneasiness on my ankle area. I consulted another renowned  doctor with all XRAY and prescription, he was really shocked seeing the black XRAY and told me he didn't understand how based on that xray some one could treat a patient. Later he advised me to do another xray and after that it was found that for the hair line fracture the way the plaster has been done, the healing was not proper and for that the bone shape got bigger and hence the uneasiness. I would not recommend this doctor to anybody. I don't know how in practo he is getting that good rating.",

But they again took the consultation fee of RS 200 , even after spending nearly RS 5000 on X-ray and treatment. This was not so for the other doctor ( orthopedic) , whom I had visited for the same bone fracture issue of my nephew. By charging consultation fee ,again and again just by citing trivial reason like , previous consultation is for only 7 days even after taking full treatment with them is definitely losing the trust and good will of the patients in my  opinion. I strictly recommend the hospital management to consider the policy of charging consultation fee , who took complete treatment with them for certain period like minimum 1 month.",
