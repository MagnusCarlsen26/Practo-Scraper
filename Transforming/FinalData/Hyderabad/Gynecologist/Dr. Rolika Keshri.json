She guides the patient in the best way possible. Highly recommended.She has been a great help in this difficult phase of pregnancy while the covid second wave was going on. Our parents could not visit us and we could not travel to our home town. She suggested every good thing possible for a healthy pregnancy.when scans were not scheduled she consulted us online, which was again helpful being covid time. Had a elective c section, she did it without any hassle or complications. She was extremely supportive in the entire process and one can see, she loves her work and puts a lot of effort in delivering healthy baby. She is empathetic towards any pain or problem you go through. simply amazing Doctor. ",
