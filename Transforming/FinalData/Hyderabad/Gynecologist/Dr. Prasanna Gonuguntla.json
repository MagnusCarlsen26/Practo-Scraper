She said she will check with dr & get back I waited & called again there was no response then I called again from another no she answered & said dr is busy in surgery & cannot meet me in evening 7-9 slot bcz assistant was not answering I went into practo again to book appointment and doctor was accepting fresh appointments between 7-9 slot so basically they don't want to take the existing patient revisit",
