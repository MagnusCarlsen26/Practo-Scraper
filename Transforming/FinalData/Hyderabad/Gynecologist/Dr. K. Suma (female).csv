We have visited prasad infertility hospital for pregnancy test. We had followed all the doctor instructions and visited regularly for check up. Used all medicines and injections.

Then doctor advised on prescription for one progesterone but nurse have given 2 progesterone. Then suddenly my wife started bleeding like anything and she was about to fall on the floor then they asked us to go for second opinion.
