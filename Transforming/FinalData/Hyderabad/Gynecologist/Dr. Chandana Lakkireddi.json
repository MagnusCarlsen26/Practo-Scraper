I don\u2019t  know why they insist/mandate Aadhar details for general consultation and regular checkups.  This clinic located in Banjara Hills, has to improve their ambiance to crate a positive environment. \n\nThe only positive point is the Dr approach to understand, hear and analyse the issue and will suggest only the required tests. \n\n\nThe staff should learn to consolidate all should have one single billing.  I made 3 payments in one consultant. \n\nDo not agree for blood tests in this clinic. They are outsourcing the tests and will not share the reports, even on request to share online they are reluctant.",

We visited multiple fertility centres for five years before coming to Nova but all in vain as almost all the fertility centres intimidated us in the name of age factor and directly suggested to go for IVF treatment and as a last attempt we visited Dr Chandana and she is the first doctor who suggested to go for IUI instead of IVF and we are happy to share that in the first attempt of IUI the result came out positive and my wife is pregnant now. Though pregnancy is a long journey getting the ***** treatment from the right doctor is very important as well and Dr Chandana came to our rescue when we were really stressed out due to infertility.\n\nDr Chandana is an excellent doctor and she made us comfortable with detailed explanation about the treatment. Dr Chandana treats her patients with empathy as most of the couples are in a state of depression because of infertility and I strongly believe if you come across the right doctor you can overcome infertility and Dr Chandana rightly fits the bill in terms of a perfect doctor.\n\nDr Chandana patiently listens to her patients concerns and will always help in clearing her patients doubts. We are extremely happy with her treatment and she is really a ray of hope for wannabe moms. I suggest everyone who is suffering with infertility problem to visit Dr Hari Chandana Madam and just blindly believe in her treatment, positive results will follow.",

My issue isn't resolved yet and am yet to go through some procedure as advised but I liked the way Doctor patiently listened through the problem, investigated and scanned herself, and further explained the possible causes and how she would like to handle it step by step. First experience was very good at every stage at the hospital from the time we entered till we exited. Thanks to Chandana madam and Nova as well for the approach in handling patients efficiently.",

I made 3 payments in one consultant. \n\nDo not agree for blood tests in this clinic.

We visited multiple fertility centres for five years before coming to Nova but all in vain as almost all the fertility centres intimidated us in the name of age factor and directly suggested to go for IVF treatment and as a last attempt we visited Dr Chandana and she is the first doctor who suggested to go for IUI instead of IVF and we are happy to share that in the first attempt of IUI the result came out positive and my wife is pregnant now. Though pregnancy is a long journey getting the ***** treatment from the right doctor is very important as well and Dr Chandana came to our rescue when we were really stressed out due to infertility.\n\nDr Chandana is an excellent doctor and she made us comfortable with detailed explanation about the treatment. Dr Chandana treats her patients with empathy as most of the couples are in a state of depression because of infertility and I strongly believe if you come across the right doctor you can overcome infertility and Dr Chandana rightly fits the bill in terms of a perfect doctor.\n\nDr Chandana patiently listens to her patients concerns and will always help in clearing her patients doubts. We are extremely happy with her treatment and she is really a ray of hope for wannabe moms. I suggest everyone who is suffering with infertility problem to visit Dr Hari Chandana Madam and just blindly believe in her treatment, positive results will follow.",

When my first cycle failed and i was left no hope and  two embryos, she carefully chose a treatment plan that wont lead to a future failure  n that choice came to be true . All thanks to god for helping us find her. . Im pregnant now 5 weeks , for the first time in 7 yrs . She is the true definition of a doctor. Listens to her patients , hears all their concerns , answers all their doubts and is Worried abt the patient\u2019s condition more than anything else . Her only focus is solving the patients problem. I would recommend her for everyone out there , trying fr a chance at parenthood . She is the one . ",
