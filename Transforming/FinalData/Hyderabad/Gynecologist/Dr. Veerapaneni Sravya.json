I had visited for my infertility issue. I had previous miscarriage history, pcod and sub septate uterus where miscarriages are prone. Dr. Sravya explains the possible options and started treatment as per our choice, I conceived after 4 months of the treatment and detected to be high risk pregnancy at 5th week where I had series of blood clots till 8th week coz of SCH. I was literally ready for one more miscarriage news. I still can't forgot saying the same with Dr Shravya and she held my hand and said \"You have to think positive for positive things to happen\" and she gave me lot of courage, hope and strength with her words.. for people with infertility more than physical treatment counseling Is required the hope need to be rooted which is done perfectly by Dr. shravya. miraculously my baby is viable and at 13 weeks I was detected with placenta previa, Dr. Shravya guided me and monitored me through out my pregnancy with weekly checkups. slowly placenta moved little up as per folow up scans... she never gave unnecessary medicines or tests at anytime..  even when I ask for medicines for some of the pregnnacy side effects she strictly say no to medicines but try home rememdies. she promised to my family that she will try to safely deliver the baby along with mother..At 38 weeks I had delivered a healthy baby boy through c sec.. but it was detected at the time of surgery that placenta is still attached to uterus.. and had to do complicated surgery which was fatal in some cases...  Dr Shravyana was also in the surgery room.. with in mins of starting the surgery I heard my baby cry which is the best moment in my entire life.. the next moment I saw complete tension mode in face of both the doctors I can see them discussing vigorously I understood something is wrong.. the next moment I know I am vomiting,my epidural anesthesia is almost wearing off im feeling the pain and movements in abdomen... both the doctors and anesthesiologist everyone is trying to make me cool.. I tried to calm myself by thinking about my new born.. but nothing worked finally Dr had to put me in local anesthesia and i remember waking up with pain.. but with releif anf happy faces of both the Dr's, nurses and my family surrounding by me. it's second life for myself. forever grateful to Dr Shravya and Dr shravanya for saving my life and bringing my cute little pie to the world as promised. I highly recommend Dr Shravya and Dr Shravanya to everyone.. especially for critical cases like me... clinic may be small in kukatpally but rest assured with the talents of Dr Shravya and Dr Shravanya you and your baby are in safe hands.

Initially I wanted my delivery to be done at my home town Warangal ,as my parents live there. During my follow up at Poornima hospital, i spoke to a couple of patients who underwent delivery at Poornima hospital. They were happy and  for a lady with High BP during delivery , she told me that the doctor checked on her hourly and deliveries went smooth .\n\n I discussed with my parents and convinced them that i want my delivery to be done in Hyderabad. Initially reluctant,later we arrived at Poornima hospital. My amniotic fluid was less with baby inverted ( Breech is the term Doctors use) . So i had to undergo Ceserean section , i remember entering Operation theatre and from then when i woke up , i remember Dr Sravya handing over the baby to me with a broad smile ,such a nice memory . I had pain for 12 hours following surgery , which gradually decreased and was discharged after 2 days .\n\n I worked with Team leader/ HR who show infinity level attitude despite not knowing ,then there is Dr Sravya filled with knowledge and no attitude .Hence i recommend her 10/10 for any gynacological procedure.",

I was in Dubai for the past 1 year and on follow up with Dr Reshma Devjani in Dubai ,she explained everything in detail that i require surgery,however i could not afford the treatment there . So when i visited Hyderabad i was reluctant to approach any doctor , as i was afraid they would be arrogant. On advice of family friend ,i visited Dr Sravya . She completely changed my opinion about Doctor ,she is such a cool personality in answering any silling questions ,at the same time she maintains 100 percent clarity on the next step . I liked her approach and underwent uterus removal at Poornima hospital. I was following her up for next 2 weeks . She has inspired me at both professional level and personal level . A huge shout out to you Madam .",

Guess what she made sure she had the instruments required for surgery before hand and also spoke to the staff assisting surgery .The surgery and follow up went on well ,pain reduced after a day and she discharged me on my 3rd day . I feel indebted to her ,as she is really such a sweet ,humble and knowledgeable soul . May God shower blessings on her and her family.",

I had visited for my infertility issue. I had previous miscarriage history, pcod and sub septate uterus where miscarriages are prone. Dr. Sravya explains the possible options and started treatment as per our choice, I conceived after 4 months of the treatment and detected to be high risk pregnancy at 5th week where I had series of blood clots till 8th week coz of SCH. I was literally ready for one more miscarriage news. I still can't forgot saying the same with Dr Shravya and she held my hand and said \"You have to think positive for positive things to happen\" and she gave me lot of courage, hope and strength with her words.. for people with infertility more than physical treatment counseling Is required the hope need to be rooted which is done perfectly by Dr. shravya. miraculously my baby is viable and at 13 weeks I was detected with placenta previa, Dr. Shravya guided me and monitored me through out my pregnancy with weekly checkups. slowly placenta moved little up as per folow up scans... she never gave unnecessary medicines or tests at anytime..  even when I ask for medicines for some of the pregnnacy side effects she strictly say no to medicines but try home rememdies. she promised to my family that she will try to safely deliver the baby along with mother..At 38 weeks I had delivered a healthy baby boy through c sec.. but it was detected at the time of surgery that placenta is still attached to uterus.. and had to do complicated surgery which was fatal in some cases...  Dr Shravyana was also in the surgery room.. with in mins of starting the surgery I heard my baby cry which is the best moment in my entire life.. the next moment I saw complete tension mode in face of both the doctors I can see them discussing vigorously I understood something is wrong.. the next moment I know I am vomiting,my epidural anesthesia is almost wearing off im feeling the pain and movements in abdomen... both the doctors and anesthesiologist everyone is trying to make me cool.. I tried to calm myself by thinking about my new born.. but nothing worked finally Dr had to put me in local anesthesia and i remember waking up with pain.. but with releif anf happy faces of both the Dr's, nurses and my family surrounding by me. it's second life for myself. forever grateful to Dr Shravya and Dr shravanya for saving my life and bringing my cute little pie to the world as promised. I highly recommend Dr Shravya and Dr Shravanya to everyone.. especially for critical cases like me... clinic may be small in kukatpally but rest assured with the talents of Dr Shravya and Dr Shravanya you and your baby are in safe hands.

Initially I wanted my delivery to be done at my home town Warangal ,as my parents live there. During my follow up at Poornima hospital, i spoke to a couple of patients who underwent delivery at Poornima hospital. They were happy and  for a lady with High BP during delivery , she told me that the doctor checked on her hourly and deliveries went smooth .\n\n I discussed with my parents and convinced them that i want my delivery to be done in Hyderabad. Initially reluctant,later we arrived at Poornima hospital. My amniotic fluid was less with baby inverted ( Breech is the term Doctors use) . So i had to undergo Ceserean section , i remember entering Operation theatre and from then when i woke up , i remember Dr Sravya handing over the baby to me with a broad smile ,such a nice memory . I had pain for 12 hours following surgery , which gradually decreased and was discharged after 2 days .\n\n I worked with Team leader/ HR who show infinity level attitude despite not knowing ,then there is Dr Sravya filled with knowledge and no attitude .Hence i recommend her 10/10 for any gynacological procedure.",

So when i visited Hyderabad i was reluctant to approach any doctor , as i was afraid they would be arrogant. On advice of family friend ,i visited Dr Sravya . She completely changed my opinion about Doctor ,she is such a cool personality in answering any silling questions ,at the same time she maintains 100 percent clarity on the next step . I liked her approach and underwent uterus removal at Poornima hospital. I was following her up for next 2 weeks . She has inspired me at both professional level and personal level . A huge shout out to you Madam .",

But i wanted surgery to be done only by Dr Sravya ,as i felt much more comfortable with her. So i requested her , to come there and do my delivery. Guess what she made sure she had the instruments required for surgery before hand and also spoke to the staff assisting surgery .The surgery and follow up went on well ,pain reduced after a day and she discharged me on my 3rd day . I feel indebted to her ,as she is really such a sweet ,humble and knowledgeable soul . May God shower blessings on her and her family.",

Dr. Sravya explains the possible options and started treatment as per our choice, I still can't forget that she's saying she held my hand and said \"You have to think positive for positive things to happen\" and her words become true. I got my pregnant after following her guidelines and she gave me lot of courage, hope, and strength with her words.  She never gave unnecessary medicines or tests at anytime.. Even when I ask for medicines for the pregnancy, due to side effects, she strictly said no to medicines, but she said try home remedies.",

However since my symptoms were persisting and with the size of the cyst increasing , she discussed surgery will be the best option . I was very nervous before the surgery and took my entire family to her. We shot about 40 to 50 questions to her , she was so patient and explained everything in an elobarate manner ,  instantaneously my family was satisfied and we went ahead with the surgery . Now my surgery scars are healing and i have no pain . She is definitely a go to person for any medical problem for me .",
