Instead, heard our problem very patiently and suggested some diagnostic procedures so that she can arrive at the exact diagnosis of the problem and suggest us the right kind of treatment. After seeing the reports, she suggested Laparoscopic surgery, for which we agreed readily and she performed the surgery within a week. Now, my wife is recovering very fast and thank God she is relieved of all the trauma & menopausal problems she had faced for the last 2 years. We are very much thankful to Dr. Neeraja Valli garu for all this. I strongly recommend Dr. Neeraja Valli garu.",

Instead, heard our problem very patiently and suggested some diagnostic procedures so that she can arrive at the exact diagnosis of the problem and suggest us the right kind of treatment. After seeing the reports, she suggested Laparoscopic surgery, for which we agreed readily and she performed the surgery within a week. Now, my wife is recovering very fast and thank God she is relieved of all the trauma & menopausal problems she had faced for the last 2 years. We are very much thankful to Dr. Neeraja Valli garu for all this. I strongly recommend Dr. Neeraja Valli garu.",
