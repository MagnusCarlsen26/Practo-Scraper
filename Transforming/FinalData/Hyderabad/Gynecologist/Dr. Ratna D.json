Dr Ratna gave us special care and attention, was available on WhatsApp for any of our queries. Also she doesn't prescribe too much of hormonal medicines unnecessarily. We got a positive jus after ,3-4 visits only. I would really recommend this doctor for any one who is planning for pregnancy. Once you start consulting her, You can just relax as she will take care of things for you and ensure you get what you need.",

We got a positive jus after ,3-4 visits only. I would really recommend this doctor for any one who is planning for pregnancy.

When we went to pharmacy to our surprise there is no increase of dosage. We went and asked her and she said she FORGOT. Then she corrected the prescription to increased dosage.\n\n2. In the next consultation, she didn't mention the composition of the tablet. My wife asked her that the tablets are different than the previously prescribed ones and she said SORRY I FORGOT and she corrected the prescription.\n\n3. In the next consultation, she forgot to tell to stop a certain medication which she asked us to stop in the previous consultation.

I was dissatisfied with the sense of punctuality of the doctor and the professionalism of the hospital. They did not even bother to inform me. The patients have to wait always.

Doc never rushed us, either with decision making or the course of treatment and clearly explained the pros and cons at every step of the way. She reverts quickly to the silliest of queries over texts or calls, easily accessible beyond work hours as well. We highly recommend her. ",
