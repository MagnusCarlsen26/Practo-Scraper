I used to come from uppal to kondapur for her consultation. Though i was very nervous to travel but her continous support made my journey easy. She predicts the problem ahead and gives medication accordingly. She handles high risk pregnancy patients more efficiently. She always prefers normal delivery and encourages prenatal exercises. I delivered safely and healthy baby in her hands. I thank you very much mam from babitha",

I used to come from uppal to kondapur for her consultation. Though i was very nervous to travel but her continous support made my journey easy. She predicts the problem ahead and gives medication accordingly. She handles high risk pregnancy patients more efficiently. She always prefers normal delivery and encourages prenatal exercises. I delivered safely and healthy baby in her hands. I thank you very much mam from babitha",
