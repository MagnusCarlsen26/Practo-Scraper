Very patient listener and a fantastic medical guide and above all a wonderful person.\n\nReferred a couple of ladies to visit her and every one of them has come back to thank me. \n\nRecommend her for her knowledge and humane approach to any problem or good news. Thank her for not being the run-of-the-mill doctor.",
