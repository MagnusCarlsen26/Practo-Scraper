There on we continued for monthly checkups and also when required. In every consultation she explained about reports of both mother and baby health.\n\nUnfortunately we need to plan our delivery in my hometown but not in Hyderabad, so we moved to our hometown after 8th month consultation. In last consultation also she guided what needs to be done for remaining months.\n\nLast week we blessed with Baby Boy, both mother and child are doing good.\n\nThank You Mam",

I strongly recommend her for her professionalism, care , explanation during the visit and she gives enough time to listen to us. She is very friendly and explains each and everything clearly with lot of patience(if she feels we didnt get the complete information she will repeat everything again ). During this pregnancy I had few issues, But she made me strong spreading the positivity. whenever I met her I feel so confident and comfortable because she will make sure i understand the issue and follow her suggestions. Thanks a lot Mam for everything..",

She listened patiently about our questions and clearly explained that there is no need to worry due to covid(About Vaccination/Hospitalization/Baby Health....)\n\nAfter speaking to her we are clear that COVID is not a constraint for continuing with pregnancy. There on we continued for monthly checkups and also when required. In every consultation she explained about reports of both mother and baby health.\n\nUnfortunately we need to plan our delivery in my hometown but not in Hyderabad, so we moved to our hometown after 8th month consultation. In last consultation also she guided what needs to be done for remaining months.\n\nLast week we blessed with Baby Boy, both mother and child are doing good.\n\nThank You Mam",

Timely Ultrasound was advised \nbut it was delayed by 3 days for reasons best known to you.\n3. I hope you appreciate the fact that the doctor has taken every effort to talk to you and examine you(even outside the regular clinic consultation hours) and advised you to visit the hospital immediately as the scan was abnormal. But you did not( reason again best known to you).\n4. It is the duty of the doctor to explain everything to the patient (not demotivate) and caution her ,especially when something is not going right.\n5. After all this, blaming a doctor for ?scar ectopic/?miscarriage is very unprofessional.\n\nThank you",
