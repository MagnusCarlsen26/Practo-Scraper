She was always available to address my concerns and provided personalized care that exceeded my expectations throughout my pregnancy. She provided treatment with utmost care as I have complication in my journey. Thank you very much Mam for encouraging normal delivery and bringing my little one into the world. \nOne more best thing is treatment provided here is affordable by anyone and unlike other multi specialty hospitals, Pooja Mam gives patients time to listen all their concerns and provides treatment giving them positive hope. Undoubtedly I would recommend her to all the expecting mothers.",

After the initial diagnosis she explained me everything in detailed and she said that there is no need to worry about the issue. But, I have so many queries about pregnancy, Dr.Puja answered all my queries in proper way with very much patience. She started the treatment, few weeks later I was conceived. I continued my pregnancy journey with Puja mam. And I decided that I don't want to change my Dr until my delivery because I loved her dedication towards the patient.\n            When I was in my 3rd month I had faced bleeding problem she worried so much, At that time Dr suggested to me that there is no need to visit the clinic , if u have any issues send ur family member I will provide medication. It shows her responsibility towards  her patients.\n            In my 7th month, I was admitted in hospital due to severe pains, on that day she took the right decision at the right time. I am glad to have a doctor like Puja mam.  I don't have words to tell about the day of my delivery..... When I entered into OT  her eyes says something for me  (I'm there for you).\n           Finally...We were  blessed with a baby boy \ud83d\ude0d....\n              Thank you soo much mam\ud83d\ude0a...I know it's a small word....but you are goddess of my life\ud83d\ude0d.",

She won't recommend much medicine,at the same time she won't give a chance for other issues.She Prescribes the medicine in advance and tells that if you feel the symptoms use this medicine otherwise not required.She was always positive in her approach and helped me steer through my pregnancy in the most convenient manner. She is full of knowledge and has extensive experience in this field. She knows the patient's concern very well and found her highly supportive during the consulting sessions. Unlike others she spent a lot of time listening to each and every concern of the patient .Most of my friends also get treated by her and no one given any concern about her treatment.Thank you so much Dr. Puja from the bottom of our hearts for taking such good and wonderful care of us\nYou are an amazing Doctor and a wonderful person!! Lots of respect and regards to you!!\nWe highly recommend her.",

I decided to visit the hospital \u201cLife care\u201d run by Dr Puja Lavania. In the beginning I was very apprehensive but the moment I met the doctor and heard her , I was relieved of tension. \n\nI met Dr Puja Lavania , I am touched to the core of my heart by the way she explained to me , diagnosed the issue and started with the treatment on the same day. She is a hidden gem in the city of Hyderabad . Her professional persona ,the way she interacts with empathy & patience is unmatchable . I truly recommend her for any gynae related treatment/deliveries. \n\n\n\nHer professional experience reflects the way she explains to the patients . I am thankful all the other doctors were not available on that day  (Sunday), else I would have missed this great opportunity of meeting this amazing doctor . She deserves all the love and respect for her noble work in making our lives easy.\n\nHighly recommend ma'am for your issues . #hiddengem***********#valueformoney",

After the initial diagnosis she explained me everything in detailed and she said that there is no need to worry about the issue. But, I have so many queries about pregnancy, Dr.Puja answered all my queries in proper way with very much patience. She started the treatment, few weeks later I was conceived. I continued my pregnancy journey with Puja mam. And I decided that I don't want to change my Dr until my delivery because I loved her dedication towards the patient.\n            When I was in my 3rd month I had faced bleeding problem she worried so much, At that time Dr suggested to me that there is no need to visit the clinic , if u have any issues send ur family member I will provide medication. It shows her responsibility towards  her patients.\n            In my 7th month, I was admitted in hospital due to severe pains, on that day she took the right decision at the right time. I am glad to have a doctor like Puja mam.  I don't have words to tell about the day of my delivery..... When I entered into OT  her eyes says something for me  (I'm there for you).\n           Finally...We were  blessed with a baby boy \ud83d\ude0d....\n              Thank you soo much mam\ud83d\ude0a...I know it's a small word....but you are goddess of my life\ud83d\ude0d.",

She won't recommend much medicine,at the same time she won't give a chance for other issues.She Prescribes the medicine in advance and tells that if you feel the symptoms use this medicine otherwise not required.She was always positive in her approach and helped me steer through my pregnancy in the most convenient manner. She is full of knowledge and has extensive experience in this field. She knows the patient's concern very well and found her highly supportive during the consulting sessions. Unlike others she spent a lot of time listening to each and every concern of the patient .Most of my friends also get treated by her and no one given any concern about her treatment.Thank you so much Dr. Puja from the bottom of our hearts for taking such good and wonderful care of us\nYou are an amazing Doctor and a wonderful person!! Lots of respect and regards to you!!\nWe highly recommend her.",

I decided to visit the hospital \u201cLife care\u201d run by Dr Puja Lavania. In the beginning I was very apprehensive but the moment I met the doctor and heard her , I was relieved of tension. \n\nI met Dr Puja Lavania , I am touched to the core of my heart by the way she explained to me , diagnosed the issue and started with the treatment on the same day. She is a hidden gem in the city of Hyderabad . Her professional persona ,the way she interacts with empathy & patience is unmatchable . I truly recommend her for any gynae related treatment/deliveries. \n\n\n\nHer professional experience reflects the way she explains to the patients . I am thankful all the other doctors were not available on that day  (Sunday), else I would have missed this great opportunity of meeting this amazing doctor . She deserves all the love and respect for her noble work in making our lives easy.\n\nHighly recommend ma'am for your issues . #hiddengem***********#valueformoney",

However, after meeting Dr. Puja with scared and disheartened heart, I explained the background to Dr. Puja who listened with very Patience. Initially she made me comfortable with her own way of understanding the case, explaining the problem made me feel so good and she brought confidence in me that problem can be solved with series of medication and surgery as very last step to give thought. Now with the medication only she controlled the PCOD and performed the IUI which was success in first attempt. There is no turnback and do not need any secondary opinion now, the kind of support she gave us was satisfactory, awesome, and extraordinary. She is so tolerant with me and answered all the queries with more patience. She recommends only to get necessary tests performed which are worthful. I highly recommend her for any Gynecology related treatments.",

It all started from there. The reports took almost a month to come back. We had to follow up so many times. Expectation setting is very poor. No follows done. Finally after the reports arrived we were advised to contact after the next conception. We tried to reach them after conception and the response was extremely poor. Imagine the anxiety the mother is going through. We did not receive a response until we had to pay for the call which is fine but the way it was done was extremely disheartening for us. Even after we paid and promised an appointment we had to follow multiple times for the call. Again, very poor expectation settings. I understand the dynamics but a little empathy and kindness goes a long way, especially for an expecting mother who has had a miscarriage and is anxious. I hope such incidents won't happen with anyone. All the best! ",

She listens to all your problems carefully and along with suitable advice she gives you a confidence to beat that problem. In fact she was so generous that answered my concerns through whtsapp as well.I had my baby through vaginal delivery during locked down in May at Lifecare hospital and it went swift because of Dr. Puja only. Also, what touched my heart was, she brought me meals for 2 days till I was there at Lifecare since circumstances were really incomprehensible due to locked down.Many Thanks Dr. Puja, you are not only a proficient doctor but a wonderful person I met in life. You really deserve all the good ratings and good wishes.",

She has been there every time we needed her and walked us through our never ending list of doubts, concerns and worries like a friendly figure.\nWe are very happy and satisfied with the services and especially the care we got. The consultation fee, scanning charges and lab charges are also quite cost conscious. A big thank you to all!\nOverall highly recommended.",

Provides practical advices..scans and medication and tests are done only if needed...and most importantly she responds to queries and messages even at mid night... It's very rare to find people who spend so much time listening to their patients .. Most of our issues seem to be solved with her sweet gesture and the time she spends with her patients.. Thank you so much :) \n",

The visit was random as the clinic was near by my residence and since then i had continued my consultation only with her. My entire journey was made easy n beautiful following her advice. It was her expertise at check up and analysing the child that everything went on smoothly. She has never advised unnecessary scans and tests but wherever required she went ahead with all the ways in which she could cooperate.The best part of her consultation is her friendly behaviour and the bond that u create over time, I find it more than of a patient n a doctor . If at all I had faced any health inconvenience during my pregnancy, Dr Pooja was just a call or message away even at midnight.  I extend my whole hearted gratitude to Dr pooja and Lifecare for this.Saumya",

After trying for good 6 years but everytime we failed but in March 2020 we got the news but with a doubt of being a false alarm. It was Puja Mam who confirmed us that we are very soon going to be parent. Your effort of not giving up on your patients is the only thing that make you an epitome of justifying your profession. ** **** ***** *** ****** *** ****** ******* ** ***** From day one you kept us motivated for normal delivery and whenever we visited your clinic we returned home with a smile on our face of having everything going smooth. You never advised unnecessary medicines or anything else that a couple wouldn't want to go through. Even during the pandemic situation you and your staff were always available online. When we look back we realise before approaching you, we have visited multiple hospitals and most of the time we were advised for either \"IUI or IVF\" which made us believe that we can never be natural parent and today we are happy and proud parent of a baby girl that has been delivered through \"Normal delivery\".We are really so obliged to you and your staff who were so dedicated and committed even on the festival day. Thanking you and your staff for once will not be enough. We highly recommend Dr. Puja Lavania to all the couples who want to hear the squeal of an angel in their life. ",

One of my colleagues suggested consulting Dr. Puja Lavania for PCOD treatment. We have visited Life Care Gynaecology hospital for Dr. Puja Lavania's consultation. We explained the background to the doctor, who listened with great patience.\nThe doctor has suggested a few investigations and, based on her hormone levels, she advised her to follow the medications for 3 months. We decided to continue with Dr.Puja Lavania after the initial visit because we were impressed with the way she analysed the complications and offered the best solution, and as a result, my wife is pregnant (in the fourth month of treatment).\nThe hospital staff are also very supportive and they help us in all ways we need. They are 100% recommended and more than worthy.",

Excellent doctor and her diagnosis is very accurate.\n2. She don\u2019t recommend unnecessary tests.\n3. Very approachable and affordable health care setup.\n4. Empathic doctor\n5. Her staff(specially Divya) is also very good.\n\nIn short I highly recommend her. Now a days you will not find such doctors frequently. Thanks doctor for everything you did for us.",

She is excellent in her work as well as she is very motivating. Her confidence gives confidence to the patient. I am a kind of person who has a fobia of medical treatments but still she handled me very properly. I always cross verified all the tests she recommended to do every month and I found that she never missed anything. I have blessed with baby girl in August. even though having some complications she handled situation very properly and helped us to get our baby girl safely. I will be always thankful to dr. Pooja.",

Before Dr. Pooja I visited two more doctors(one of the top most doctors in City) where the basic tests for infertility were not done completely which are utmost important to check for conceiving but pooja mam did those tests in first cycle and identified my infertility cause suggested course for that problem. And also she is the one who suggested to check natural cycle with follicular scan in middle of cycle to avoid unnecessary medicines if naturally my body is responding(which was not checked by previous doctors). Thank you soooo soooo soooo much mam for your service. With your interaction I got confidence a lot in terms of leading my infertility. ",
