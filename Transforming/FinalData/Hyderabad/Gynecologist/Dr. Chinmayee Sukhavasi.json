The staff, from reception to nursing to the brilliant medical team, were not only highly professional but also genuinely empathetic. They understood the emotional toll that infertility takes on couples and provided a safe space for us to share our concerns and fears.\n\nOur journey began with a thorough examination and an in-depth discussion about our medical history. Dr. Chinmayee took the time to explain every aspect of the fertility treatments available to us, tailoring her approach to our unique situation. This personalized care was a refreshing change from previous experiences where we often felt like just another case.\n\nOne of the standout features of Feminova was her commitment to transparency. We were informed about the potential risks and success rates of each procedure, enabling us to make informed decisions about our fertility treatment. This open communication fostered trust and allowed us to feel in control of our journey. \n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Chinmayee to anyone on a similar journey. The combination of expertise, compassion, and a patient-centric approach makes this clinic stand out in the realm of fertility treatments. Our experience here has been nothing short of transformative, and for that, we are forever grateful!",

The staff, from reception to nursing to the brilliant medical team, were not only highly professional but also genuinely empathetic. They understood the emotional toll that infertility takes on couples and provided a safe space for us to share our concerns and fears.\n\nOur journey began with a thorough examination and an in-depth discussion about our medical history. Dr. Chinmayee took the time to explain every aspect of the fertility treatments available to us, tailoring her approach to our unique situation. This personalized care was a refreshing change from previous experiences where we often felt like just another case.\n\nOne of the standout features of Feminova was her commitment to transparency. We were informed about the potential risks and success rates of each procedure, enabling us to make informed decisions about our fertility treatment. This open communication fostered trust and allowed us to feel in control of our journey. \n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Chinmayee to anyone on a similar journey. The combination of expertise, compassion, and a patient-centric approach makes this clinic stand out in the realm of fertility treatments. Our experience here has been nothing short of transformative, and for that, we are forever grateful!",

Advised for few tests following the procedure.\n\nBased on the reports she even suggests is there any chance of medical management or we need to go surgery.\n\nIn my mother case, both the options were possible so Doctor explained and left the discussion on us. We went ahead for Hysterectomy surgery.\n\nSurgery took place in Ankura Gachibowli, everything went very smooth and my mother is doing fine. She is also doing very good now. \n\nDr.Chinmayee Sukhavasi was always available over the call if needed.\n\nI will recommend Dr. Chinmayee Sukhavasi.",

We have received 5-6 calls asking us to reschedule the appointment considering the lunch time of the doctor and later got a call to reschedule it again because the doctor had to  go for a surgery. Finally, after cancelling all our plans to accomodate these impromptu requests - voila! the doctor becomes available and we get another call to come in 15-30 mins.Time management folks! The least that is expected from a clinic.",

Other clinics we were called for embryo transfer at 9am and my wife started spotting in the noon and the transfer was done at 6pm. This is a very ethical and patient focused centre. I highly recommend Dr. Chinmayee and Feminova Fertility Clinic as the best fertility clinic in Hyderabad. Kudos to the team !",

Other clinics we were called for embryo transfer at 9am and my wife started spotting in the noon and the transfer was done at 6pm. This is a very ethical and patient focused centre. I highly recommend Dr. Chinmayee and Feminova Fertility Clinic as the best fertility clinic in Hyderabad. Kudos to the team !",
