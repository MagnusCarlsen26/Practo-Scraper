I felt like It was a business going on there.\r\n  i could not effort this costly treatment and continue to next  month  anymore  so visited another Doctor .\r\nDR.Jayaprada(11 years experience)\r\nObestetrician and Gynaecologist\r\nDR.Jaya is very friendly and listened to  all my problems and gave me counsiling.\r\nDR.Bhavani gave medicines worth of 2400/-Rs.....where as Dr.Jaya gave me medicines worth of 1000/-RS\r\nDR.BHavani charged 2600 for test(Scan, Thiroid, blood.etc)... DR. Jaya is  charging 1200 for the same tests.\r\n Consultation fee Dr.Bhavani  500/-RS.... Dr.Jaya 250/-( not worried about it as she is more experienced)\r\nAlmost i spent  2850/-RS  more. This amount really matters for me.\r\n\r\nI don't suggest anyone not  to go to this doctor... if you can effort you can go. I just  Explained the things that i  experienced.

DR. Jaya is  charging 1200 for the same tests.\r\n Consultation fee Dr.Bhavani  500/-RS.... Dr.Jaya 250/-( not worried about it as she is more experienced)\r\nAlmost i spent  2850/-RS  more.
