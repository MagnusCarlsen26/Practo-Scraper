She suggested a hospital where she takes care of deliveries for her patients and gave her word that no other doctor would touch her patient  (we didn't want any other doctor except Radhika man).We were constantly consulting her at Diya fertility center as the due date was approaching,We contacted her at 9AM in the morning when water broke and based on the symptoms she asked us to admit my wife at the hospital in AS rao nagar.She cancelled all her other appointments and came down to the hospital by 10AM, after checkup she advised that we should wait till the pains are more frequent and didn't want to prescribe any injections for pains.she came back at 2PM and prescribed injections for pains as per the situation and left.The hospital staff were constantly updating her about the situation.She was back at 5:30PM and  delivered a baby girl.I never expected doctors to be so commited in todays world. I would definitely recommend her if you are expecting a baby and  looking for a doctor to consult.",

She suggested a hospital where she takes care of deliveries for her patients and gave her word that no other doctor would touch her patient  (we didn't want any other doctor except Radhika man).We were constantly consulting her at Diya fertility center as the due date was approaching,We contacted her at 9AM in the morning when water broke and based on the symptoms she asked us to admit my wife at the hospital in AS rao nagar.She cancelled all her other appointments and came down to the hospital by 10AM, after checkup she advised that we should wait till the pains are more frequent and didn't want to prescribe any injections for pains.she came back at 2PM and prescribed injections for pains as per the situation and left.The hospital staff were constantly updating her about the situation.She was back at 5:30PM and  delivered a baby girl.I never expected doctors to be so commited in todays world. I would definitely recommend her if you are expecting a baby and  looking for a doctor to consult.",

I'm blessed with a baby girl after 5 cycles of treatment and IUI performed by Radhika madam. Madam has been quite reliable and fulfilled our dream of becoming parents, despite me having hypothyroid and PCOS condition. Both me and my husband are quite thankful to madam for our happiness. \n",
