When I got to know that am pregnant, my go to person was Dr.Madhumathi.\nThough I was been in other state until my second trimester, she was always a call away to advice and guide me. Her investigations are deeper and makes sure her patient is perfectly alright. In a word, journey with such doctor is stress free and happy. \nI strongly recommend Dr madhumathi for any of your gynic problems and obstetrics",
