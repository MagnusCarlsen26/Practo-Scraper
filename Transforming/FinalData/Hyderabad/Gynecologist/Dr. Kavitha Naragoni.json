Dr Kavitha Madam thorough evaluation and understanding of family history allowed for a comprehensive approach to healthcare, and I am immensely grateful for her attention to detail.\n\nThe successful outcome of the surgery is a testament to Dr Kavitha Madam skill and commitment to excellence. Dr Kavitha Madam guidance and support throughout the entire process alleviated any apprehensions I had, and I felt reassured knowing I was I safe hands.\n\nAs we know, time is very precious and most of them do not have a patience/willingness to listen to the patient\u2019s concerns but she answers the questions with patience and clarity that truly set a benchmark, what a doctor needs and patients expect from any doctor.\n\nI feel very fortunate that we still have such an amazing doctor in the healthcare system. Kavitha Madam, you are the best doctor I have ever met from the genealogical dept. \n\nWishing you Kavitha Madam a continued success in your practice and endeavors.\n\nThis is my genuine Feedback and Thank you. \n",

Doctor arrived, not even bothered about my pain and sense my emergency. She told me that it might be a miss carriage and asked my husband and me to decide whether we want go for surgery or a natural clean. When asked more about surgery she was not ready to explain and asked us to hurry up and take the decision. she was so careless which made us take second opinion about the Hospital and we rushed to Fernandez , where scanning was done immediately and told that my baby was still alive.\r\n\r\nNow you guys decide how to rate her and this so called hospital on their commercial advice given to the patients.\r\n\r\nWe were also told that taking patient at this time is of high risk but i was safe until i reach Fernandez\r\n\r\nEventually my miss carriage happened next day but not when i was at KIMS. They could have killed by their treatment if we would have continued there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n",

Dr Kavitha Madam thorough evaluation and understanding of family history allowed for a comprehensive approach to healthcare, and I am immensely grateful for her attention to detail.\n\nThe successful outcome of the surgery is a testament to Dr Kavitha Madam skill and commitment to excellence. Dr Kavitha Madam guidance and support throughout the entire process alleviated any apprehensions I had, and I felt reassured knowing I was I safe hands.\n\nAs we know, time is very precious and most of them do not have a patience/willingness to listen to the patient\u2019s concerns but she answers the questions with patience and clarity that truly set a benchmark, what a doctor needs and patients expect from any doctor.\n\nI feel very fortunate that we still have such an amazing doctor in the healthcare system. Kavitha Madam, you are the best doctor I have ever met from the genealogical dept. \n\nWishing you Kavitha Madam a continued success in your practice and endeavors.\n\nThis is my genuine Feedback and Thank you. \n",

Doctor arrived, not even bothered about my pain and sense my emergency. She told me that it might be a miss carriage and asked my husband and me to decide whether we want go for surgery or a natural clean. When asked more about surgery she was not ready to explain and asked us to hurry up and take the decision. she was so careless which made us take second opinion about the Hospital and we rushed to Fernandez , where scanning was done immediately and told that my baby was still alive.\r\n\r\nNow you guys decide how to rate her and this so called hospital on their commercial advice given to the patients.\r\n\r\nWe were also told that taking patient at this time is of high risk but i was safe until i reach Fernandez\r\n\r\nEventually my miss carriage happened next day but not when i was at KIMS. They could have killed by their treatment if we would have continued there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n",
