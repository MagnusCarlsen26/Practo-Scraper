It\u2019s rare to find a doctor such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. In every single hospital I faced disappointment and depression but at Prasad's hospital, Dr. Shravanya has shown result in 3 months. Now I am pregnant. I am very lucky to have such a doctor and the staff was always very helpful and kind. I highly recommend to approach Dr. Shravanya to any issues related to infertility.  We are immensely happy with the way the she takes cares of each and every aspect in terms of mental and physical support required by the patient. She also respond for calls and messages (24x7), this is impeccable quality we never seen in any doctor. \nWhole hearted thanks to DR. Shravanya and the entire staff for extended support. \n",

Not only she has taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. In every single hospital I faced disappointment and depression but at Prasad's hospital, Dr. Shravanya has shown result in 3 months. Now I am pregnant. I am very lucky to have such a doctor and the staff was always very helpful and kind. I highly recommend to approach Dr. Shravanya to any issues related to infertility.  We are immensely happy with the way the she takes cares of each and every aspect in terms of mental and physical support required by the patient. She also respond for calls and messages (24x7), this is impeccable quality we never seen in any doctor. \nWhole hearted thanks to DR. Shravanya and the entire staff for extended support. \n",
