She will not over complicate any complaint that we face during pregnancy and believes in natural treatment.

She has encouraged me during every visit towards natural and normal delivery. She never gave any additional medicines but just iron and calcium.

I have reached 39weeks and when I still has not got pains, she has done a 5secs method of stripping and next day early morning baby started making way out.

I am fortunate to consult her and I happily delivered a baby boy very smoothly and labour went only for 15mins. I truly recommend and give credit to Jasmine doctor for a Miraculous journey towards motherhood.",2021-10-27 14:25:55,False,True,Anoosha,,,

Whenever someone who doesn't not conceive naturally,they always come for medical help. All the test are done to rule out why some one does not conceive . To make formation of eggs, tablet and injection are given. Even after conceiving,to support pregnancy tablet are given.abortion is not in the hand of doctor. 
Giving life is only in god's hand,we can only help u out with present available technique.

Many of my patients conceive and gone through similar treatment and succeeded also.
There is consultation charges in every hospital and clinic which everyone pays. U can check in other fertility centre too.
If u have any abortion,u will have pain.if ur pain not decreasing ,then u have to come and consult me. Not writing and guiding the public here. 

Every one are quite educated here and they can know the doctor treatment very well.          

I have many patients,who I have helped in conceiving, guiding in pregnancy and delivering too. 

Few pt didn't conceive also. Every one is educated here and they know very well whether treatment and test are going right or wrong. If someone does not like treatment,they are free to consult other doctors. 
Even u have written such things by guiding public  (who are  intelligent and educated with every information), still I feel sorry for u bcoz u had a miscarriage. 
God help both of u to concieve.best of luck in your life and future.
Even best of the hands in the world may not bring life to the earth .
