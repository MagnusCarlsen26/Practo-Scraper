With a calm and reassuring demeanor, she effortlessly translated complex medical jargon into easily understandable language, ensuring I comprehended every aspect of my health concerns. Her ability to listen attentively and answer my questions in a comprehensive yet empathetic manner made each visit a comforting experience.\n\nOne thing I truly appreciated about Dr. Tanuja was her unwavering commitment to patient care. She never rushed through appointments, taking the time to address all my concerns, instilling a sense of confidence and trust in her expertise. Her genuine concern for my well-being extended beyond the examination room, as she consistently followed up on treatments and test results, showcasing her dedication to providing holistic care.\nThe depth of Dr. Tanuja's knowledge and her ability to convey information were exemplary. While Dr Tanuja communication skills and dedication to patient care were commendable. \n\nAll I would finally say is that Dr Tanuja remains an exceptional gynecologist whose empathetic communication style and commitment to patient welfare shine brightly. I wish her all the very best and all the success to come.\n\nThanks and regards,\nSydney Hall, Victoria Wilson parents of Shrewyn Hall \n\n\nNOTE: SHE IS A DOCTOR A FRIEND AND THE BEST \u2764\ufe0f",

With a calm and reassuring demeanor, she effortlessly translated complex medical jargon into easily understandable language, ensuring I comprehended every aspect of my health concerns. Her ability to listen attentively and answer my questions in a comprehensive yet empathetic manner made each visit a comforting experience.\n\nOne thing I truly appreciated about Dr. Tanuja was her unwavering commitment to patient care. She never rushed through appointments, taking the time to address all my concerns, instilling a sense of confidence and trust in her expertise. Her genuine concern for my well-being extended beyond the examination room, as she consistently followed up on treatments and test results, showcasing her dedication to providing holistic care.\nThe depth of Dr. Tanuja's knowledge and her ability to convey information were exemplary. While Dr Tanuja communication skills and dedication to patient care were commendable. \n\nAll I would finally say is that Dr Tanuja remains an exceptional gynecologist whose empathetic communication style and commitment to patient welfare shine brightly. I wish her all the very best and all the success to come.\n\nThanks and regards,\nSydney Hall, Victoria Wilson parents of Shrewyn Hall \n\n\nNOTE: SHE IS A DOCTOR A FRIEND AND THE BEST \u2764\ufe0f",

It was my mistake that I didn't want to give that tension to a girl who is about to write her MBA exams ...and it has got nothing to do with female anatomy .This is how we break  news   to anyone if we r suspecting cancer...first we speak to the attendants and then to the patient irrespective of their age...and worse conduct...?I was all filled with sympathy that a 19 yr old girl has to go through this but this is wat u make out of my concern.
