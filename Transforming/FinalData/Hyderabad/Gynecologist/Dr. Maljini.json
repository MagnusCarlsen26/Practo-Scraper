Choosing a right hospital was a very important decision for us during this sensitive phase of pregnancy . I have heard one of our colleagues speaking very high about Dr Maljini and the Cloudnine team. After going through multiple discussions with family and friends & the reviews by other patients. We felt very positive and went ahead with cloudnine. The appointments were very well scheduled with minimal waiting without any discomfort to the patients. We scheduled an appointment with Dr. Maljini madam while my wife was in her 3rd month. The moment we spoke to her on the day of the visit - we realized that it is the best decision of our life by consulting her. She is very kind, supportive, understanding and patient. Her expertise, compassion and dedication made a significant impact on my wife's physical and emotional well-being. She is just a call away to guide us sail through this pregnancy journey to address any concerns or questions within no time. We are extremely grateful for her personalized attention and guidance from the early stages till this point of time.

Dr. Maljini  is approachable and responsive.  She has a calming effect on the patient, which is much needed especially during any difficult phase in the pregnancy.  \n\nThroughout my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery phase mam was very supportive which made my pregnancy  journey comfortable. \n\nShe is a fabulous doctor and thanks to her I am blessed with a healthy baby girl.

Makes suggestions rather than just tell what has to be done, her instead ability to not hand out a list of tests to be done at every complaint instills confidence in her as a Doctor. Started to visit her for a bad menses problem and since then she has just been a call away for me. As a woman patient that is a big support system to have always. All friends who I have recommended her to have always come back satisfied. Recommend her to all women who want a genuine and supportive doctor when in a health issue. ",

Her treatment approach isn't centric to giving medication, she offers natural remedies and suggestions which were very helpful during my pregnancy phase. \n\nI suffered with a severe phase of vomiting during my first trimester, and mam's treatment helped me get through the phase. Dr. Maljini  is approachable and responsive.  She has a calming effect on the patient, which is much needed especially during any difficult phase in the pregnancy.  \n\nThroughout my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery phase mam was very supportive which made my pregnancy  journey comfortable. \n\nShe is a fabulous doctor and thanks to her I am blessed with a healthy baby girl.

She has the most calming effect on any patient in any anxiety phase. She makes you so comfortable that one can talk about the health issue in detail and ask all questions that she answers patiently. Makes suggestions rather than just tell what has to be done, her instead ability to not hand out a list of tests to be done at every complaint instills confidence in her as a Doctor. Started to visit her for a bad menses problem and since then she has just been a call away for me. As a woman patient that is a big support system to have always. All friends who I have recommended her to have always come back satisfied. Recommend her to all women who want a genuine and supportive doctor when in a health issue. ",
