"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Laparoscopic Surgery (Obs & Gyn),",0,0,YES,"About Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu

I came to know about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu after doing an online search regarding the best Laproscopic surgeons in Hyderabad. After reading several experiences that her pateints have shared on various online forums, I was more optimistic about my problem being resolved in the best possible way. When I first met her on 23rd Jan 2021 in her clinic, I was little nervous about how to get started with sharing my previous health issues. The way Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu received me and made me comfortable and gave me time to settle down, I felt it to be very good. She was very kind and patient to listen to my entire story and gave me the confidence that everything's gonna be alright. She has a very striking personality and has a positive energy all around her, I personally felt like sometimes its the way you are made to feel by doctors matters the most while going for a medical procedure. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu suggested me to undergo a pelvis scan test which I got it done as per her suggestion at Dr. Madhavi Scan Center. I had several follow up sessions with her and I always made sure that I ask her the questions and clear the thoughts in my mind and Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu was very polite in answering them all. I was diagnosed with a 5 cm fibroid (which I already knew) after the pelvis scan report was out and I wanted to get that removed by Laproscopic surgery. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu explained me the risks related to the surgery very clearly and assured me not to be too scared about it and prepared me to be ready mentally. She was not hesitant about sharing any relevant information and at the same time never looked to hurry the proceedings. She advised me to get the medical tests done wich were relevant going for the laproscopic surgery. She also prepped me with the required things to be done and carried leading to the surgery. Finally I had my laproscopic surgery done by Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu and her team as planned on 20th Feb 2021 in Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills and the entire experience was very good and smooth. I was able to stand up, walk, get discharged and go home the very next day i.e. 21st Feb 2021. I met the doctor again after a week post the surgery as advised and felt satisfied with the treatment received. 

The best thing I liked about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu is her humblessness and down to earth attitude. She connects with her pateints in a very friendly nature and not like typical old school doctors (no offence here) and she doesn't get offended to answer our layman/silly questions and has good sense of humour in her answers. Indeed, I feel good and take pride that we have a doctor like Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu in our society and country and we need more doctors as such. I would definitely reccommend Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu to all the ladies who have or undergoing women's related health issues. GOD bless her with best of  health, peace  and life full of bliss.",2021-05-11 11:09:34,False,True,G Srinivas Rao,,,

DR Vimee Bindra is the best gynecologist I have ever come  across.

After further investigations Dr vimee explained that I will have to undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy.she clearly also mentioned i might have a chance of open surgery because of the huge fibroid size but always assured me that she will try her best to avoid it.
