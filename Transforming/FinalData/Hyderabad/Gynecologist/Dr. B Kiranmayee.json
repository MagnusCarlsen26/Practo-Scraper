On the day of my delivery I was almost 10 cms dilated by the time I reached the clinic, Dr kiranmayee mam immediately called the ambulance  and came along with us in the ambulance and assured me that everything will be well and she is there to take care of me and my baby. I have delivered a beautiful baby girl via normal delivery, which wouldn't have been possible without kiranmayee mam. Thanks a lot for the positivity and encouragement you have given during my delivery. I strongly recommend Dr kiranmayee mam for all those who are looking for a positive birth experience.",

It's not just a feedback I would like to share my experience with everyone so that you will get more confidence towards Doctor's treatment. One thing I want to clearly say please have trust on your doctor,people may deviate with other opinions during your treatments and don't lose patience while you go for fertility treatment it's more important to have faith on your doctor if you trust Dr Kiranmayee ,she will do wonders and it happend in my case friends. Most importantly the way she treat patients as more than a doctor like a friend ,I have been to other fertility clinics no where I see this much care and detailed explanation during treatment. Dr. Kiranmayee dedication at her work really impressive specially if you have scans or procedures even on holidays or festivals what ever the day it might be she will make herself available ,I have never seen this dedication in any of the doctor's I visited till date.i hope my message will be useful for at lease some people who is really looking for correct doctor.",

Dr. Kiranmayee\u2019s temperament and her preference for natural methods of conceptions are the reasons why we held on to her right till the \u201cbeginning\u201d of a new phase of our lives. Her constant follow-ups, check-ups and scans continued for a few months when my husband was hit with COVID-19 in Nov\u201920. Doc advised us to take a break for a few months till he recovers fully. We finally conceived in Apr\u201921 and it has been a roller-coaster ever since. Since that time, Dr. Kiranmayee started keeping a personal tab on my well-being and this increased as we progressed through the trimesters. She has been with us every step of the way. She was with us even after labor -advising, counselling, guiding, all of it. Her patience, reassuring and calm demeanor were the strongest reasons why we were so stress-free throughout the gestation period. From a point where, as a couple, we were thinking that we might have to go for IUI or IVF, to giving birth via the natural process, all of this was possible only because of her expertise.\n\n \n\nIf you\u2019re a couple who\u2019s planning a baby and are looking for a trust-worthy doctor, she is the one you need to talk to.",

Luckily we were introduced to doctor by another doctor. Firstly doctor makes the patient comfortable and discuss about the issues and gives solution accordingly in a very comfortable way. I was given treatment accordingly. I got the HSG tube test done and some other tests done, results got Success .I followed all the advices and treatment given by doctor. I conceived Pregnancy in the Second cycle after first cycle was done and we are very happy to be treated by her. Dr Kiranmayee herself does all the scans and check her patients regularly and closely. She has lots of patience and never gives false hopes. She is very fast and quick in her approach. During my Checkups she took utmost care to conceive pregnancy and good health. I was asked to do monthly tests to keep a check on my health. Thankfully it is going on smoothly. Dr Kiranmayee will never leave you alone in any circumstances and she is available at any time in the entire day-to-day life for clarifying the doubts. Simply She is always with you. We and our family are also so proud of Dr Kiranmayee. She is Simply Awesome Doctor in today\u2019s world. Thank you so much Dr Kiranmayee Madam.",

One thing I want to clearly say please have trust on your doctor,people may deviate with other opinions during your treatments and don't lose patience while you go for fertility treatment it's more important to have faith on your doctor if you trust Dr Kiranmayee ,she will do wonders and it happend in my case friends. Most importantly the way she treat patients as more than a doctor like a friend ,I have been to other fertility clinics no where I see this much care and detailed explanation during treatment. Dr. Kiranmayee dedication at her work really impressive specially if you have scans or procedures even on holidays or festivals what ever the day it might be she will make herself available ,I have never seen this dedication in any of the doctor's I visited till date.i hope my message will be useful for at lease some people who is really looking for correct doctor.",

Dr. Kiranmayee\u2019s temperament and her preference for natural methods of conceptions are the reasons why we held on to her right till the \u201cbeginning\u201d of a new phase of our lives. Her constant follow-ups, check-ups and scans continued for a few months when my husband was hit with COVID-19 in Nov\u201920. Doc advised us to take a break for a few months till he recovers fully. We finally conceived in Apr\u201921 and it has been a roller-coaster ever since. Since that time, Dr. Kiranmayee started keeping a personal tab on my well-being and this increased as we progressed through the trimesters. She has been with us every step of the way. She was with us even after labor -advising, counselling, guiding, all of it. Her patience, reassuring and calm demeanor were the strongest reasons why we were so stress-free throughout the gestation period. From a point where, as a couple, we were thinking that we might have to go for IUI or IVF, to giving birth via the natural process, all of this was possible only because of her expertise.\n\n \n\nIf you\u2019re a couple who\u2019s planning a baby and are looking for a trust-worthy doctor, she is the one you need to talk to.",

Also the medication was so simple that I had to mix the medicine in 1 litre water and drink it.It gained a lot of trust in me.\nLater I consulted mam for pregnancy and mam tracks everything very closely and gives best suggestions. I am happy that I got conceived in first month my pregnancy trial.\nAlso staff is very good and they do a followup even if I forget to visit the clinic.You also have a testing center just beside the clinic which is very easy and helpful for your blood tests.\n\n************************************\nI highly recommend everyone to visit Kiranmayee clinic for any gynic issues.",

She treated my wife with nominal medication for the complications she had during pregnancy and treated us like family . In the pendemic situation of Corona also she was in contact over phone and whatsapp and checked her on time. She always motivated us and helped us understand all our queries. She waited for almost 24hours patiently for normal delivery and never encouraged us for C section but due to some medical issues we were forced to do C section and that was also done very nicely under her guidance. Thank you so much Dr Kiranmayee for your help and support and at last I would recommend her to everyone as she is not at back of money and gives priority to patient's situations and health first. ",

I consulted doctor kiranmayee we want to become parents please give me treatment. She noted all the problems and started treatment from last month. Regular scans and medication. We were surprised that in the first cycle i got a pregnancy test positive. In last one year we struggled to become pregnant. Doctor scanned and gave suggestions to take care why because she suspected small bleeding clots in Uterus. Suggested to take weekly injections and regular medication. No weight lifting, no long travelling etc. She cares for patients in a very friendly manner. I trust my doctor to get a healthy baby at this time. I strongly recommend Doctor Kiranmayee for all types of health issues. She will care for patients and deafnetly you will fulfill your dreams. Once again thank you so much to doctor Kiranmayee from the bottom of my heart. I will update my experiences this pregnancy.",

I have had slip disc earlier so she made sure the process was very smooth while egg retrieval and embryo transfer. she made sure that we followed her plan quite religiously and to our luck we conceived in the first attempt of IVF.\n\nI recommended her to my friends and family to consult her for any gynic related issues.",

As Vijaya nursing home is a 24/ 7 hospital and we take care of emergencies so at times it gets difficult to see patient on time when we have to attend an other patient who has come on emergency basis. Our staff are striving best to provide consultation to them at the earliest especially those who are in 9th month. Regret the inconvenience caused. Will definitely put our efforts to give best service to you!\n\nRegards, \nDr. B. Kiranmayee",
