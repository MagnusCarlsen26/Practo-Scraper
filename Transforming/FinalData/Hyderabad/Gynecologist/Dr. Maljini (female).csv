My wife is very skeptical about hospitals in general. Choosing a right hospital was a very important decision for us during this sensitive phase of pregnancy . I have heard one of our colleagues speaking very high about Dr Maljini and the Cloudnine team. After going through multiple discussions with family and friends & the reviews by other patients.
