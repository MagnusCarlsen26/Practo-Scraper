She never gave any additional medicines but just iron and calcium.\n\nI have reached 39weeks and when I still has not got pains, she has done a 5secs method of stripping and next day early morning baby started making way out.\n\nI am fortunate to consult her and I happily delivered a baby boy very smoothly and labour went only for 15mins.

I am consulting her since 3months now and she makes sure to answer all our questions and makes us feel at ease.  She made sure not to call me to visit frequently amidst the covid times.So far,  my initial months have not been easy but she is extremely generous and guides you correctly everytime you visit her.From my experience,  she is all you'll need to be the supporting pillar in your pregnancy too. We are glad to have found her.",

                "review_text": "Dr Jasmine has been very friendly, she listens very patiently and she will not be oberwhelmed to handle the first pregnancy excitement.\n\nShe will not over complicate any complaint that we face during pregnancy and believes in natural treatment.\n\nShe has encouraged me during every visit towards natural and normal delivery. She never gave any additional medicines but just iron and calcium.\n\nI have reached 39weeks and when I still has not got pains, she has done a 5secs method of stripping and next day early morning baby started making way out.\n\nI am fortunate to consult her and I happily delivered a baby boy very smoothly and labour went only for 15mins. I truly recommend and give credit to Jasmine doctor for a Miraculous journey towards motherhood.",

After going through a lot of reviews online,  we thought of visiting Dr. Jasmin, which I think was our best decision. I am consulting her since 3months now and she makes sure to answer all our questions and makes us feel at ease.  She made sure not to call me to visit frequently amidst the covid times.So far,  my initial months have not been easy but she is extremely generous and guides you correctly everytime you visit her.From my experience,  she is all you'll need to be the supporting pillar in your pregnancy too. We are glad to have found her.",

Not only she delivered the baby successfully but also she managed to keep my wifes hypertension post delivery on check. She made a genuine effort to meet my wife and the baby personally everyday to keep a check on them. She is a thorough professional with a human touch. I would highly recommend Jasmin mam. ",
