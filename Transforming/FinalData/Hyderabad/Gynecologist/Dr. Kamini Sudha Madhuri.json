I have visited this doctor in the last trimester (9th month)of my pregnancy and we were very much worried that we have changed our doctor and came to a new person in the peak time but all those worries went into vain after meeting you. With all your friendly, soothing & positive words I became very much confident that I'm in safer hands. She maintains all the patient records very nicely & updates the record after every visit to her. She spends ample time towards patients and listens all our queries and addresses them in a polite way. She is always approachable at any time over calls or messages to address our concerns. She treats with utmost care and prescribes only minimal medicines and encourages for only normal delivery. She was more friendly to me, and I was very comfortable with her and she explained about the delivery process many times very patiently as I was afraid of having normal delivery. She removed all the fears and provided much support during my labour. But at the end, due to some issues I have opted for C section and she even motivated me after chosing c sec. But finally I have delivered a Beautiful Baby Girl under her supervision and post pregnancy follow up is also awesome. We were extremely happy and fully satisfied with your treatment & we made a good decision by choosing you in my pregnancy journey. Will never forget ur care towards me and ur smiling face and words u said after delivering my baby. Finally I would extend my sincere gratitude to you and it was my pleasure to meet such a wonderful person like u. From bottom of my heart i would thank you for making my journey smoother & successful. I would highly recommend this doctor. Hope you make many smiles alike us to all the patients with your treatment!! Wishing you all the best :) ",

One of the best things about the doctor is that she is available round the clock for any kind of emergencies. She is very friendly and gives ample time during each visit. Even though my delivery took place unexpectedly at 3PM in the midnight , doctor and her entire team were available for me within few minutes after reaching the hospital. Would definately recommend the doctor for twin pregnancy care and delivery. ",

I have visited this doctor in the last trimester (9th month)of my pregnancy and we were very much worried that we have changed our doctor and came to a new person in the peak time but all those worries went into vain after meeting you. With all your friendly, soothing & positive words I became very much confident that I'm in safer hands. She maintains all the patient records very nicely & updates the record after every visit to her. She spends ample time towards patients and listens all our queries and addresses them in a polite way. She is always approachable at any time over calls or messages to address our concerns. She treats with utmost care and prescribes only minimal medicines and encourages for only normal delivery. She was more friendly to me, and I was very comfortable with her and she explained about the delivery process many times very patiently as I was afraid of having normal delivery. She removed all the fears and provided much support during my labour. But at the end, due to some issues I have opted for C section and she even motivated me after chosing c sec. But finally I have delivered a Beautiful Baby Girl under her supervision and post pregnancy follow up is also awesome. We were extremely happy and fully satisfied with your treatment & we made a good decision by choosing you in my pregnancy journey. Will never forget ur care towards me and ur smiling face and words u said after delivering my baby. Finally I would extend my sincere gratitude to you and it was my pleasure to meet such a wonderful person like u. From bottom of my heart i would thank you for making my journey smoother & successful. I would highly recommend this doctor. Hope you make many smiles alike us to all the patients with your treatment!! Wishing you all the best :) ",

One of the best things about the doctor is that she is available round the clock for any kind of emergencies. She is very friendly and gives ample time during each visit. Even though my delivery took place unexpectedly at 3PM in the midnight , doctor and her entire team were available for me within few minutes after reaching the hospital. Would definately recommend the doctor for twin pregnancy care and delivery. ",

I visited the doctor after seeing almost 10 other doctors and was most satisfied with the way she treated me. Mine was a complicated pregnancy since m diabetic and I was too anxious. She understood my anxiety and was extremely patient with me. ******** *** ****** ********* *********** ****** ***** ** ********** I would come across something and ask her for tests, etc but she would explain that unless something is wrong, those tests aren\u2019t necessary. The bottom line is from being told by a doctor that I can\u2019t conceive to delivering a healthy baby naturally isn\u2019t an easy feat and Dr Sudha supported us throughout the journey. Even when I went for post partum  check up, she was very warm. She actually came out of the clinic to our car to meet our baby and that says a lot considering she is so busy. Overall you will find a very warm person who will guide you through your journey and be extremely supportive. I would strongly recommend her. We will always remain grateful to her. My husband calls her our angel.",

My wife conceived next month and we found that in 7th week. Our journey from 8th week to delivery had been smooth despite of few complications my wife faced. Doctor prescribed right medicines to overcome all complications. She gives chance to patients to ask questions and answers in detail. Always available a text away for queries. I didn't get a chance to express gratitude in person, so I'm taking this as an opportunity to thank Sudha madam for smooth experience.",
