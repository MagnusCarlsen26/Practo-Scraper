I conceived for the second time after 4.5 years of my first baby at the age of 39 and delivered after turning 40.\nI would recommend her for any kind of infertility/pregnancy/menopause treatment and I am sure your prayers would be answered with her treatment.

I think you're disturbed with this loss but if you go back and try to recollect I've seen your reports already and it doesn't a take experienced doctor hours to go through a report and she conceived within no time that means treated effectively with minimal medications . Coming to waiting time this is not uncommon as we treat patient priority wise . And about playing games on the mobile replying to patients who text on WhatsApp and seek online medical advice like you then yes I was playing games ,and if I don't reply to them they call me without waiting for my  reply like how you used to call . And one fine night you called me late evening and wanted to come to me where ever I am as you were very anxious about the well being of the baby .so you came to me inspite of asking you to come to sanctum the next morning and you came very late to the clinic making me wait past my clinic timings and also the other scan centres were closed around this time so couldn't help u people. And last but not least if you conceive with or without treatment you need to take certain precautions for about 10-12 weeks and travelling and all that is at your own risk. I've been treating at sanctum for the past 3 years and have an overall experience of 14 years and many people conceived and gave birth naturally at sanctum itself without any issues. THANK YOU .\n",

I conceived for the second time after 4.5 years of my first baby at the age of 39 and delivered after turning 40.\nI would recommend her for any kind of infertility/pregnancy/menopause treatment and I am sure your prayers would be answered with her treatment. Just have belief and trust in her.",

From day one to today as we blessed with baby boy Doctor guidance and interest made us happy parents. Doctor is reachable for 24/7 and the special care on each patient is mind blowing. I strongly recommend couples facing infertility problems to just visit once and follow the doctor\u2019s advice and trust will surely be happy parents like us.

Madam handled my wife and baby with utmost care, her staff are also very supportive and have nicely taken care of my wife and baby during the stay in the nursing home. Nursing home is clean and hygienic, well maintained. Overall It was a delightful experience and I highly recommend madam for any maternity or gynecological related issues.",

I think you're disturbed with this loss but if you go back and try to recollect I've seen your reports already and it doesn't a take experienced doctor hours to go through a report and she conceived within no time that means treated effectively with minimal medications . Coming to waiting time this is not uncommon as we treat patient priority wise . And about playing games on the mobile replying to patients who text on WhatsApp and seek online medical advice like you then yes I was playing games ,and if I don't reply to them they call me without waiting for my  reply like how you used to call . And one fine night you called me late evening and wanted to come to me where ever I am as you were very anxious about the well being of the baby .so you came to me inspite of asking you to come to sanctum the next morning and you came very late to the clinic making me wait past my clinic timings and also the other scan centres were closed around this time so couldn't help u people. And last but not least if you conceive with or without treatment you need to take certain precautions for about 10-12 weeks and travelling and all that is at your own risk. I've been treating at sanctum for the past 3 years and have an overall experience of 14 years and many people conceived and gave birth naturally at sanctum itself without any issues. THANK YOU .\n",
