,"Maternal Care/ Checkup,Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,Pregnancy Tests,",0,0,YES,"Thanks is just a small word, and there‚Äôs nothing that can express our gratitude towards Dr.SriDevi.
Doctor has been with us for our entire pregnancy journey, believe me every visit is a pleasure full one. We had two unsuccessful conceiving during last two years (when we consulted different doctors), but our confidence got boosted multi fold right from our first check up with Dr.SriDevi.
She never prescribed unnecessary medications or unnecessary tests. And Dr used to explain the importance of each medicine and test prescribed.
She always spent good amount of time with us, cleared all our doubts and misconceptions, taught us the right things. (This is something we were lacking during our past two bitter experiences with different doctors).  This developed a special bond for us with the doctor, She is like our family member now.
Doctor and Staff were always available at anytime. We had few ‚Äúfalse alarms‚Äù during and after 36 weeks of pregnancy, and had to rush to hospital on a Sunday, and few times in late hours. 
Kudos to Staff, they were super responsive on the phone call and readily available in the hospital, take LST tests and send them to doctor and guidance of doctor at those critical times were really a boon to us.
Thanks to Dr.SriDevi and Team (Anusha, Sandhya, Sireesha, Amani, Leela, Radha, Kamala, Aayamma, Hope I ve not missed any name here :) ) for all your support.
Now we have our baby, and We will miss all of you, seems like a last of college when we bid farewell to all our good friends and teachers :)
All the best to all the staff, Wish a lot more success to Dr.SriDevi",2023-11-10 09:44:16,False,True,Manoj Sai Mandela,,,

Dr. Ragi took detailed note of my past history and took all measures to protect my pregnancy by all means. My overall pregnancy journey has been smooth.

I am extremely blessed  to have Dr. Ragi as my consultant in this pregnancy journey. Though my pregnancy journey has been overall smooth, surprisingly my water broke at 4am on 35th week. My husband called Sai Neha hospital at that odd hour 4am to inform emergency. Within 5 mins, Dr. Ragi called back and has been all throughout over phone and guided me till I took admission. She was constantly there and ensured that I have safe delivery. I am extremely grateful to her the way she dealt the emergency situation and ensured my and my baby's safety. I strongly recommend her for consultation. I have earlier visited many gynaecologists who would charge Rs. 700/- for consultation but wouldn't even spare 7 minutes for you.
