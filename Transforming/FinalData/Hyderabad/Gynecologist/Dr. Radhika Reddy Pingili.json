I didn\u2019t knew how to react. It was a mixed feeling as somewhere in my heart I knew that I cannot carry the baby for long. I was 5 weeks 6 days pregnant And, we were advised by the doctor to abort the baby, we took opinion of pulmonologist too but he advised us the same. So with a heavy heart we had to go for MTP. Post MTP, I suffered from various health issues (thyroid, anemia\u2026) I worked on my health. Got all the tests done again and then tried to conceive. We tried for 2-3 years, but didn\u2019t get any positive result. \nThen we decided to consult a infertility specialist and hence we reached out to Dr. Radhika. After our first meeting with the doctor, we had immense trust in her as she was approachable, honest and forthright. She explained us everything well in the initial appointments that later we didn\u2019t had any questions to ask but just the faith in her expertise. She advised her to go for IVF ICSI and counselled us briefly about the same. It was a costly affair but all worth it. We started our IVF journey in the month of February, 2023  and now (May,2023), we are over the moon to announce our first pregnancy. Trust in doctor leads to wonders. \nCannot thank Dr. Radhika enough to have have walked with us in this journey and supporting us all the time. \nMay God bless her! \n\nWe are grateful and blessed \ud83d\ude07 \nSeeking love and blessings for the days to come in our parenthood journey \ud83d\ude4f\n-Harshu and Sudhanshu \n",

But you have waited so long for this happiness, have a little more patience. Not everyone gets success in 1st attempt. It varies for every couple. So be patient and stay positive. That\u2019s what worked for me.\nWe have been trying to conceive for 8 years. I have been struggling with PCOD due to which I had unbalanced hormone issues. I did stimulated ovulation cycles, ovarian drilling but no result. Then shifted to Hyderabad and looked for an IVF specialist nearby online. That\u2019s how I met my doc Dr. Radhika Reddy Pingli. She was very polite, positive, calm and reassuring that we will go down this path together to help me conceive. We straightaway asked for IVF as we had waited for a long time.\nWe conceived the first time (1st FET) itself, but unfortunately I had early miscarriage naturally. My beta HCG levels dropped. That\u2019s when it hit me badly as if I can never be a mother. But I kept my patience and I had to face the failure for next 2 FETs as well. 3 failed FETs and I was heartbroken but I did not lose my hope and my trust on Dr. Radhika. As she said, she really walked down this path with us. She understood my emotional situation, always offered positive advice and was always available on phone outside the hospital hours. She adapted to changes in my treatment to provide the best for me. She is very friendly and a good listener. We are blessed and I am 7 months pregnant right now. Though my conceiving journey was also a bit tensed but she helped me get through the first 5 months smoothly and I could see the happiness on her face too, which showed her concern for me. She helped us to choose a gynaecologist to continue with.\nThanks to Dr. Radhika, it\u2019s my dream come true to be a mother. Though it took us more than a year due to this pandemic situation and 3 FET failures but all's well that ends well. We highly recommend her to anyone aspiring to be parents but facing difficulties. We will definitely meet her with our baby once the situations are normal cause she is the one who gave us this happiness and I can never thank her enough.",

We visited almost all the big named hospitals in Gachibowli/Chandanagar/Lingampally/Kondapur/Madhapur areas of Hyderabad giving the doctors all the time and money they wanted and ended up with no positive results. We were almost at the edge of losing hope to have baby. A doctor in one of the hospital during a routine checkup then referred us to Dr. Radhika.\n\nWe went to see her and were highly impressed by the friendly nature, vast knowledge and experience she's got and decided to go with the treatment plan she suggested.  Looking at the various procedures done by other doctors, Dr. Radhika gave us the suggestions to go with other options for 2-3 months while preparing my wife for IVF with necessary medication and lifestyle changes.  Ovum pickup was done in the month of November and the Embryos were frozen. She then checked for the best situation (health/lining/mental preparedness etc.) for next  2-3 months and then finally did the Embryo Transplant in the first week of March. She waited for Dec/Jan/Feb to ensure the best suitable body condition for the ET in order to avoid any kind of risks. She doesn't compromised on that even when we were asking her to do ET early. She explained us all the reasons whenever asked and we were satisfied by her explanations always.\n\nFinally, we got the reports for my wife's pregnancy and it's positive!! We are so very happy/excited and are so grateful to Dr. Radhika who brought happiness to our lives!!\nThank you Dr. Radhika!! You are God's sent Angel for us!! Thank you so much!!\n\nI highly recommend her.",

She first listens to our problems and has a great potential and experience in diagnosis and treatments. It was the wisest decision by us to consult Dr.Radhika for our problem. It is the 4th Year of our married life and after one miscarriage,  one of our family friend advised us to visit Dr.Radhika for treatment.\n\nWe took our first appointment in Sep-2021, and by the time I'm sharing my story in Jan-2022 my wife is 3rd month pregnant. Before consulting Dr.Radhika, we visited 2,3 hospitals but none of them were able to spot the problem. She carried out few tests and procedures, and explained us the problem and that was not so serious. She assured us that within 6 months of affordable treatment, all the minor issues will be gone. But it didn't even take that long, just within 3 months of treatment my wife has become pregnant. \n\nI strongly recommend every couple out there with fertility problems, to consult Dr.Radhika. She has lot of patience to listen to us before starting any treatment. She clearly explains the problem and the procedures before she starts the problems. Not only the Doctor, but also Innovate Fertility Clinic staff are so polite and helpful. Once again, thanks a million Dr.Radhika ma'm.",

I didn\u2019t knew how to react. It was a mixed feeling as somewhere in my heart I knew that I cannot carry the baby for long. I was 5 weeks 6 days pregnant And, we were advised by the doctor to abort the baby, we took opinion of pulmonologist too but he advised us the same. So with a heavy heart we had to go for MTP. Post MTP, I suffered from various health issues (thyroid, anemia\u2026) I worked on my health. Got all the tests done again and then tried to conceive. We tried for 2-3 years, but didn\u2019t get any positive result. \nThen we decided to consult a infertility specialist and hence we reached out to Dr. Radhika. After our first meeting with the doctor, we had immense trust in her as she was approachable, honest and forthright. She explained us everything well in the initial appointments that later we didn\u2019t had any questions to ask but just the faith in her expertise. She advised her to go for IVF ICSI and counselled us briefly about the same. It was a costly affair but all worth it. We started our IVF journey in the month of February, 2023  and now (May,2023), we are over the moon to announce our first pregnancy. Trust in doctor leads to wonders. \nCannot thank Dr. Radhika enough to have have walked with us in this journey and supporting us all the time. \nMay God bless her! \n\nWe are grateful and blessed \ud83d\ude07 \nSeeking love and blessings for the days to come in our parenthood journey \ud83d\ude4f\n-Harshu and Sudhanshu \n",

I did stimulated ovulation cycles, ovarian drilling but no result. Then shifted to Hyderabad and looked for an IVF specialist nearby online. That\u2019s how I met my doc Dr. Radhika Reddy Pingli. She was very polite, positive, calm and reassuring that we will go down this path together to help me conceive. We straightaway asked for IVF as we had waited for a long time.\nWe conceived the first time (1st FET) itself, but unfortunately I had early miscarriage naturally. My beta HCG levels dropped. That\u2019s when it hit me badly as if I can never be a mother. But I kept my patience and I had to face the failure for next 2 FETs as well. 3 failed FETs and I was heartbroken but I did not lose my hope and my trust on Dr. Radhika. As she said, she really walked down this path with us. She understood my emotional situation, always offered positive advice and was always available on phone outside the hospital hours. She adapted to changes in my treatment to provide the best for me. She is very friendly and a good listener. We are blessed and I am 7 months pregnant right now. Though my conceiving journey was also a bit tensed but she helped me get through the first 5 months smoothly and I could see the happiness on her face too, which showed her concern for me. She helped us to choose a gynaecologist to continue with.\nThanks to Dr. Radhika, it\u2019s my dream come true to be a mother. Though it took us more than a year due to this pandemic situation and 3 FET failures but all's well that ends well. We highly recommend her to anyone aspiring to be parents but facing difficulties. We will definitely meet her with our baby once the situations are normal cause she is the one who gave us this happiness and I can never thank her enough.",

We visited almost all the big named hospitals in Gachibowli/Chandanagar/Lingampally/Kondapur/Madhapur areas of Hyderabad giving the doctors all the time and money they wanted and ended up with no positive results. We were almost at the edge of losing hope to have baby. A doctor in one of the hospital during a routine checkup then referred us to Dr. Radhika.\n\nWe went to see her and were highly impressed by the friendly nature, vast knowledge and experience she's got and decided to go with the treatment plan she suggested.  Looking at the various procedures done by other doctors, Dr. Radhika gave us the suggestions to go with other options for 2-3 months while preparing my wife for IVF with necessary medication and lifestyle changes.  Ovum pickup was done in the month of November and the Embryos were frozen. She then checked for the best situation (health/lining/mental preparedness etc.) for next  2-3 months and then finally did the Embryo Transplant in the first week of March. She waited for Dec/Jan/Feb to ensure the best suitable body condition for the ET in order to avoid any kind of risks. She doesn't compromised on that even when we were asking her to do ET early. She explained us all the reasons whenever asked and we were satisfied by her explanations always.\n\nFinally, we got the reports for my wife's pregnancy and it's positive!! We are so very happy/excited and are so grateful to Dr. Radhika who brought happiness to our lives!!\nThank you Dr. Radhika!! You are God's sent Angel for us!! Thank you so much!!\n\nI highly recommend her.",

She first listens to our problems and has a great potential and experience in diagnosis and treatments. It was the wisest decision by us to consult Dr.Radhika for our problem. It is the 4th Year of our married life and after one miscarriage,  one of our family friend advised us to visit Dr.Radhika for treatment.\n\nWe took our first appointment in Sep-2021, and by the time I'm sharing my story in Jan-2022 my wife is 3rd month pregnant. Before consulting Dr.Radhika, we visited 2,3 hospitals but none of them were able to spot the problem. She carried out few tests and procedures, and explained us the problem and that was not so serious. She assured us that within 6 months of affordable treatment, all the minor issues will be gone. But it didn't even take that long, just within 3 months of treatment my wife has become pregnant. \n\nI strongly recommend every couple out there with fertility problems, to consult Dr.Radhika. She has lot of patience to listen to us before starting any treatment. She clearly explains the problem and the procedures before she starts the problems.

Right from the first visit, she heard out our concerns completely (unlike other doctors who simply asked us to get tests without even talking to us) and only then suggested a treatment plan accordingly. Every step of the way, she explained the reasons for the next stage of treatment and counselled us to take the right decision without forcing us to take any specific step.  We faced multiple challenges during our journey to conceive (multiple IUIs, IVF), but her vast experience with these situations and her friendly & caring attitude made it easy for us to completely trust her on the treatment plan. Her decisions were never rushed and she waited for the right time for my body to be supportive of next treatment steps. She is also extremely approachable and responded to all our questions throughout patiently.  Thanks to her efforts, our prayers are now answered and we are looking forward to our baby's arrival soon! Highly recommend anyone facing infertility issues to visit Radhika mam!",

Even after conceiving,I was too anxious which would've surely irritated someone, what with the incessant questions but she has been so patient throughoutand that helped me get through the first trimester and after that when I had to choose a gynaecologist to continue with, she actually helped me find one which was not very easy because I don't get comfortable very soon but somehow she understood this and she helped me find someone who I was comfortable with which honestly she didn't have to do. She couldve just referred me to anyone but she knew how special this is for us and more than anything I think that's the reason I would recommend her. Because she knows how important this is for us. In short you will feel that positivity instantly and trust me that's what you need more than treatment. ",

After many years of not being able to conceive, I was terrified to start my journey with a fertility doctor. Now I can happily say that getting consulted under Dr Radhika Reddy Pingili was my best decision ever. The greatest quality is that she puts patients at ease. She is quick and decisive and does not recommend un wanted tests even after prompting. It\u2019s very evident that she has a full understanding of what her patients may be going through emotionally, physically, and spiritually. I had so many questions and was so confused at the beginning, but she knew exactly how much to answer me and also quickly deviate my thoughts from wandering into unwanted queries, which is very important for any IVF patient. My success was actually important to her. An amazing feeling from a doctor these days. \nWe had a game plan and I am proud to say I am 6 weeks pregnant. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Dr. Radhika and me and my husband just can\u2019t thank her and her team enough. \nI know how tough a decision it is to choose the right fertility doctor and I would heart-fully recommend her to anyone who is having fertility issues.

During our first consultation Mam listened to our concerns and suggested to do a scan for which I am very scared and didn\u2019t cooperate but Mam pampered and cared me a lot. My first scan was so scary as I am not prepared mentally. Gradually Radhika Mam\u2019s pampering and care made me come out of that mindset. Most of the doctors nowadays directly jump to conclusions and suggest some or other treatments to become parents. Dr. Radhika\u2019s way was totally different first did a scan and later went for all blood works to know hormonal levels and suggested vitamin based on the result. We did continue the medication and hoped for the best and continue visiting clinic regularly every month for scans and blood work to conceive naturally with my PCI\u2019s condition for 4months but later we decided and asked ourselves for quick results then we were informed about other methods and the best is IVF went ahead we have started our IVF journey in the month of may 2022 with the outstanding medical and moral support provided by Radhika Mam we got the positive result in the month of June 2022. After that we are doing regular follow ups during my pregnancy and suddenly on a Sunday started seeing heavy bleeding during end of 3 rd month morning and immediately contacted Mam who is available when needed over mobile and immediately Mam asked to come down to clinic and performed scan and confirmed everything is good and we need to take good care as there is slight sub chronic heamarage for which we are following Mam advise and care. Finally I would suggest Dr. Radhika Reddy for any fertility or gynaecology related issues she plays multiple roles (friend, mother,sibling etc) when needed for a woman",

Have a follow up soon to get complete diagnosis and start treatment but the whole initial interaction with Dr.  Radhika, the way she handled me, the way the scan was conducted.... everything was smooth and well done. I am very observant of how a doctor treats the patients too(being from a doc's family) (apart from the actual problem solving and treating) and in that she was perfect. She put me at ease, was very approachable and soft spoken and also very confident in reassuring me. Feeling much calmer than I was before meeting her and am confident that my issues will be handled well.\n\nThe staff was also very good, did their job really well, specially the drawing of blood for sample. It was done pretty well.",

I was looking for a doctor who has undergone training in US or Europe and after a lot of due diligence until came across Dr Radhika. My biggest worries with Ivf abroad was trust and the unknown. \n\nDr Radhika put all my worries at ease from the very first call. She took care of all our treatment plan, tests, results etc. Dr Radhika coordinated all our treatment from A to Z. We all know how it feels once the IVF journey starts, I highly Recommend Dr Radhika as she is honest, trustworthy and compassionate.\n",

But to much of our apprehension, she kept us knowing all the reasons and remedies to get rid of the problem in a very transparent way. And finally we conceived at the first month itself. And she didn't even prescribed any single medication for treatment. She only followed all the natural procedures. We are very happy and thankful to her and can suggest to visit her for treatment related to infertility. Thank you Ma'am.\n\nSanta",

My wife had miscarriage and the doctor supported us during covid also. Clinic is in the main area which is close to my house and the management staff is also very supportive. I would suggest to visit the doctor once as your gynecologist. The clinic also provides infertility treatment and IVF. I have seen many couples leaving happily after successful conception.

She explains everything so well and gives you all the positive energy that you needed the most. She is very supportive and even resolves your queries on phone as well. I remember when I had to undergo one surgery due to some complications,she was so supportive with not only me but with my husband also who was very scared of the whole situation. She was constantly in touch with me on phone and made sure that I recover quickly. I am in owe of her for lifetime for helping us in embracing the most important aspect of life as being a parent.\nThank you so much Dr.Radhika :)",

Moreover she was very friendly and patient while listening to our problems and within few months from the initial miscarriage my wife conceived again and she is doing fine this time under her guidance. I would like to recommend Dr. Radhika for couples who are facing issues with infertility or miscarriages. Thanks Dr. Radhika. Good luck. ",

The perspective of a couple changes in the first meet itself. Unparalleled persona she has!\n\nAt Innovate, She does the scan, she spends quality time with patients with absolutely no hurry, boosts up your mental strength as well. \n\nFortunately by God's grace and Ma'am's power, I'm at my early stage of pregnancy now. Huge thanks to Ma'am for everything.",

Now I am in 4th Month.  There are no words to express the joy of being pregnant\nWe started our treatment with Dr. Radhika Reddy Pingili from November. \n\nShe suggested before going to do IVF we will try for one last IUI and we were so worried about my next step because I had 5 failed IUI's on me but all were failed in various hospitals.  Finally, she succeeds to us to agree for one IUI. Before IUI she did one laparoscopy first, diagnosed right and then I conceived at the first IUI at Radhika Mam's Clinic.  \n\nThere are no words to express the joy of being pregnant. Now the long-awaited day came n I was declared PREGNANT. for the first time in my life.\n\nThanks a lot mam. we'll be always grateful to you. ",

However, without asking to wait for few more days she had done tests worth 15000. Also, she gave the medicines worth 10000 for a month in the first visit itself and folecular tracking from the 3rd day of the periods in alternate days without goving chance to conceive for a month or two. However, we were reluctant to spend that much money as our reports were OK and we waited for the day of the period. Now we are happily pregnant without any medicines and with proper diets.\n\nNote: The fees mentioned are only visit fees. There are additional registration fees involved and compulsory trans vaginal checkup worth 1200 involved in the first visit itself.",

She has been a constant support, and has always taken out time to explain the intricacies behind a decision. While she presents all the options available with utmost sincerity, she also ensures that there is an educated decision taken and we decide the course we would want to take. Apart from that, despite a huge footfall, Dr. always made our experience very very interpersonal, and we felt right at home, even when the times were not the greatest. The support staff is equally adept, supportive and ever present to make one's experience the best possible in the given circumstances.We had visited the Dr after TTC for a few months. After several tests, a definite reason for infertility could not be determined, and hence she suggested IVF. We finally received success in the 2nd frozen embryo transfer cycle. She was with us, every step of the way, earnestly trying to help us achieve the joy of parenthood. We are, and shall be, forever grateful. Highly recommend.",

Our hope has begun once we got a reference from one our close relatives who also a patient of Dr. Radhika Reddy Pingili. First and foremost thing I would like to mention about Dr. Radhika madam is her deep understanding of the subject and her evaluation of the patient status before going with actual treatment. She is very much friendly and gives ample time to the patients to explain the problem and discusses clearly all the possibilities of the treatment. She has very good expertise in the treatment and she tried multiple options for me (my case was bit complex) in the IVF treatment and after passing all hurdles now we are seeing positive results which is very happy news for us. Needless to say that, now our hope has becoming stronger which began some time back. Doctor is monitoring me regularly and gives suggestions whenever required. She is always available for any queries or doubts during emergencies and answers the questions patiently.\n\nWe are very thankful to madam for all the above and we feel very lucky enough that we met Dr Radhika who is not only a doctor but a nice human being.",

It is often associated with inauspicious, unlucky myths and the woman goes through a lot of social and family pressure. Under these circumstances, what we look for is an expert in treating the infertility problem. At the same time, one who is very honest, could understand our social pressure, economical condition, physical health and gives the right hope and apt solution. Doctor Radhika is a perfect blend of these. Being skeptical, we used to ask her many questions and She is very patient in addressing all and never rushed the appointments. After our failed IUI cycles, we would like to consider other alternatives like Ayurveda before getting into IVF (Because of its cost and hormonal medications). Doctor was very supportive, didnt discourage us even a little bit about this. After six months, we went back to her for IVF. What we saw in IVF was truly a miracle, thanks to all the scientists and our doctor, we are pregnant now. Since she brought the wonders of science into our life, she is always our \"Wonder Woman\" :) She is very supportive in all our disappointed situations and always dedicated in getting the fruitful results. We are very happy to have our doctor by our side in this strenous journey!",

At innovate clinic there is a direct connect between patient and doctor. No matter how busy she is, you will always get out of clinic fully satisfied and all your questions answered. I admired her way of working and the kind of person she is. *** ********* ** *** ******* ** ***********  When we started our treatment after reviewing all my reports we worked to bring some components to  favorable values and finally when we went for IVF in first shot it's positive.  She never rushes for things but takes enough time to review even minutest of details to not miss anything out and do everything to the perfection. I highly recommend her to everyone  who are struggling with getting pregnant as the clinic logo itself says\"hope begins here\" and i can't agree more. \n\nMy journey to motherhood has just started, and yes i m going through the fear and anxiety of early pregnancy but its my faith on God and  trust on Dr. Radhika  are the two things giving me strength that i will sail through it.\n\nThanks from bottom of My heart Ma'am. I Can't thank enough to God that I met you. Humbled to core.\nPadmini",

But this time with the help of Dr Radhika, case study of the previous failed 3 IVF cycles was done and guided accordingly which was successful in our 4th Cycle. \n\nAppreciate the Doctor for reviewing the history of the previous cycles and putting up a proper , comfortable and perfect plan for us to get the 4th cycle positive. hoping for the best, fingers crossed.",

We have approached Dr. Radhika Ma'M through references. \n\nTrue to her reputation, we found her to be very meticulous, ************** and friendly. What we liked the most is that she considers the patient's best interests and prescribes her treatment. She also understands emotional issues around fertility treatment and offered her advice that instilled confidence and faith in us.\n\nAnother excellent thing about her is that she adapts her treatment according to the patient and never makes you go for unnecessary tests or surgeries. She is also available for advice and support outside hospital hours. \n\nThanks to Radhika Ma'M's treatment, we became pregnant within 4 months since starting the treatment. We highly recommend her to anyone having infertility issues. ",

In the very first visit we realised that she is the one. She is very friendly and possesses vast knowledge in her subject. Other doctors suggested me to do a myomectomy which we were not keen to do but she only suggested me to take injections instead of operation in order to reduce the fibroids. It was her positive attitude from the very beginning that all my frustrations gradually faded away and I became confident. Under her treatment all my problems got minimised and now I am on my family way. She was always there for me, just a call or message away. Another important aspect of her personality is that she never runs after money. She only prescribes/suggests things which are actually needed for treatment. Highly recommend her.",

I have pcod problem where my periods are irregular, she first checked with natural iui and then next month she went with stimulated iui.She regularly monitored every cycle of treatment carefully and explained the problem in detail. During iui process, she diagnosed that the cervix is tight and advised us to go for hysteroscopy which is a basic surgery.Then she did iui the next month which is a success. Now ,I am 2 months pregnant.I would strongly recommend  her for any infertility  problems,the way she welcomes every patient with smile and the way she explains the problem and treatment is fabulous. She answers to each and every question patiently.

She is so nice that she personally informed me over phone about my reports as she had some emergency call and she won't be able for check up today. She didn't give me unnecessary medicines and as I am detected with hypothyroidism she has recommended me for an endocrinologist. I am very much satisfied with her as she is experienced, well mannered, highly committed towards her profession and patients.",
