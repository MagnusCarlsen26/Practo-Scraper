,,0,0,YES,"I recommend  Dr. Susmitha Reddy

We have recently visited her clinic located at Nizampet for pregnancy related checkup . My wife has little bit nervous and many questions about her health and pregnancy, but doctor listens all of them patiently and helped in boost her confidence level. She is so nice and down to earth kind of attitude make us more comfortable.

Her suggestions and experience really working well for my wife. I really appreciate your help Dr. Susmitha Reddy.

Moreover she responds to our call in case of any urgent matters and make her self highly available whenever required.

One suggestion to all from my side please don't go by brand like Rainbow, Fernandez etc instead go by doctor and her experience.

Hope all works well with you. Have a great day.

Best Regards,
Ravikanth Manik.
