I hope this would help someone to find a good doctor and a good hospital....\n\nIt has been more than 11 months that the doctor and her wonderful team at Birth Place Hospital brilliantly delivered my baby (it was NVD) ...and now Iam surprised to witness the fact that Dr Samatha still recognizes me. \n\nWe went for our baby's routine checkup with a pediatrician at Birth Place Hospital, Gatchibowli .. and Dr Samatha didnot hesitate to come and have a talk with me and my husband to know about my daughter's well abouts when she saw us waiting there.\n\nThis shows how much the doctor is dedicated and committed towards her profession and patients. *********** *** ******* ** *** **** ****** ** ** ********** if you are some like me going through the process for the first time and have many questions that are bothering for a hassle free delivery. \n\nAnd also Birth Place Hospital, it is one of the best hospitals in the city which is well maintained and clean. I am very happy that I could find this hospital in Hyderabad. Really appreciate the management for maintaining the hospital so well and also for hiering doctors like Samatha which makes us feel like being at home.. each and every penny spent is worth spending.\n\n",

She explained us the entire procedure and gave us good set of tips on exercise and meditation, which really worked. She ensured that we are well informed on every aspect of delivery at the right time and helped me calm down my anxiety levels, which are quite common for expectant mothers. She encouraged me to continue work and lead a normal life as she rightly said that - Pregnancy is not a disease, it is a beautiful experience and indeed, it is. I cannot thank her enough for making the whole experience of delivering my son so memorable and least painful with the affection she gave me during the process. In addition, I would like to mention that she takes care of her patient post-delivery and stresses on taking good care of the mother. Lastly, I would definitely advice anyone to go to Birthplace and to Doctor Samatha if you do not want to stress and do not want to bother yourself much.",

Really appreciate the management for maintaining the hospital so well and also for hiering doctors like Samatha which makes us feel like being at home.. each and every penny spent is worth spending.\n\n",

She explained us the entire procedure and gave us good set of tips on exercise and meditation, which really worked. She ensured that we are well informed on every aspect of delivery at the right time and helped me calm down my anxiety levels, which are quite common for expectant mothers. She encouraged me to continue work and lead a normal life as she rightly said that - Pregnancy is not a disease, it is a beautiful experience and indeed, it is. I cannot thank her enough for making the whole experience of delivering my son so memorable and least painful with the affection she gave me during the process. In addition, I would like to mention that she takes care of her patient post-delivery and stresses on taking good care of the mother. Lastly, I would definitely advice anyone to go to Birthplace and to Doctor Samatha if you do not want to stress and do not want to bother yourself much.",
