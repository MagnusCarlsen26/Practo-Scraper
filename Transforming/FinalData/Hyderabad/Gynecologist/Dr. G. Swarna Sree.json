We were seeing doctor swarna from the very beginning. Her superlative degree of experience and knowledge has helped us to imbibe the qualities that are generally required to be a parent. The amount of experience that she brings on the table is simply immense and vast. The complete delivery process was carried out very seamlessly and absolutely with no hassle. From every corner of the hospital I was guided things step by step. The articulating capacity of each individual associated with our pregnancy is outstanding. Thankyou would be a too small word for me to dust off the experience of us with Zoi. The one hospital I have seen where the doctor says c section will not be done since the path is fully functioning and favorable for a natural or normal delivery. Hats off to our lady in shining armour Dr swarna who led this really well and gave all of us a sigh of relief. \n\nMy gratitude and appreciation will also remain for Mr venkat who handled my insurance process to be complete without any intervention of mine post signing the set of insurance documents. Mr venkat ensured that he managed the entire process so well that I had zero involvement. The support and level of knowledge Mr Venkat has is worth commendable !!!!  Lastly I would like to conclude saying that we have a very special relationship that has built over a period of time with zoi. A beautiful relationship which is filled with care,love,trust,dedication and commitment.\n\nIt is imperative for us to stand out and deliver superior results which Zoi has proved in my case and I am sure in other cases as well. Good luck and all the best Zoi hospital Somajiguda !! Way to go and many more to come.\n\nRegards\nAniket & Barnali.",

I know the doctor for a very long time I met her In Vivekananda hospital I am a regular patient to her. But then in the joy hospital, this was my first visit. The doctor's behavior is very good very cool and friendly. Hospital everything is good except for the reception they make us wait for a long time we patients have to stand in a line for the billing and for collecting the reports. There are only two persons in the reception at least they can have one more person in the reception and the pharmacy also whatever medicines we need almost all 50% of the medicines will be not available there. \\r\\n\\",

We were seeing doctor swarna from the very beginning. Her superlative degree of experience and knowledge has helped us to imbibe the qualities that are generally required to be a parent. The amount of experience that she brings on the table is simply immense and vast. The complete delivery process was carried out very seamlessly and absolutely with no hassle. From every corner of the hospital I was guided things step by step. The articulating capacity of each individual associated with our pregnancy is outstanding. Thankyou would be a too small word for me to dust off the experience of us with Zoi. The one hospital I have seen where the doctor says c section will not be done since the path is fully functioning and favorable for a natural or normal delivery. Hats off to our lady in shining armour Dr swarna who led this really well and gave all of us a sigh of relief. \n\nMy gratitude and appreciation will also remain for Mr venkat who handled my insurance process to be complete without any intervention of mine post signing the set of insurance documents. Mr venkat ensured that he managed the entire process so well that I had zero involvement. The support and level of knowledge Mr Venkat has is worth commendable !!!!  Lastly I would like to conclude saying that we have a very special relationship that has built over a period of time with zoi. A beautiful relationship which is filled with care,love,trust,dedication and commitment.\n\nIt is imperative for us to stand out and deliver superior results which Zoi has proved in my case and I am sure in other cases as well. Good luck and all the best Zoi hospital Somajiguda !! Way to go and many more to come.\n\nRegards\nAniket & Barnali.",

The doctor's behavior is very good very cool and friendly. Hospital everything is good except for the reception they make us wait for a long time we patients have to stand in a line for the billing and for collecting the reports. There are only two persons in the reception at least they can have one more person in the reception and the pharmacy also whatever medicines we need almost all 50% of the medicines will be not available there. \\r\\n\\",
