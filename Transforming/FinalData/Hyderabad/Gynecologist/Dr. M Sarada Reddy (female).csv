They always 0vercharge and once when i confronted the staff they told that they have taken advance payment for our next visit and tests. can any hospital do so without even telling the patients? i never went to thi hosital post this incident. and i have to collect 2500 rs that they charged in advance for scanning. You never get to see the scanned report as they not even provide hard copy for your reference. *** *** * **** *** ***** ***** **** *** ** **** ** ****** ************ ,2020-01-11 10:23:44,False,False,Ragini Yadav,"One copy is given to the patient

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Sarada Reddy First of all, I think she is a brilliant physician and surgeon. But, what really makes her stand out is how she made me feel like I was her only patient and that she would spend as much time with me as I needed. she was incredibly thorough in not only asking me about my history, but in explaining all my options. she called before my surgery to see if I had any more questions, and she called several times after to see how I was doing and to update me on the results. she emphasized that I should feel free to contact her any time with any questions. I think the highest compliment one can give a doctor is that they treat a patient like a member of their family and Dr. Sarada did that for me. I feel so lucky to have found her!",2022-01-04 09:28:11,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
