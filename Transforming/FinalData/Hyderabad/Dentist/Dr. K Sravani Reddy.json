I was in pain from several days due to cavity in my two uper tooth. I used to have difficulty in eating or drinking any cold food and felt sensitivity. At the peak of the pain, I couldn't eat anything. Once I was in pain for whole night and couldn't get relief even after taking painkillers. I was very worried because I also had to submit my dissertation in few days and it was too difficult to do it with such severe pain. Next day I went to her clinic and told her my problem. After patiently and calmly listening to my problem, she made me comfortable and suggested me root canal treatment for both teeth which would take 3-4 sittings. I was very curious and had many queries in my mind regarding this procedure, she answered my all questions and explained everything in detail. I accepted her advice and started my treatment with her. On the first day I was very scared but she convinced me that I would not feel any pain in whole procedure due to anesthesia and if I feel any discomfort I just had to raise my hand. She was right. It was a painless procedure with full comfort. She was very gentle and carefull with the tools. Initially I did not like the bitter taste of Gel which is applied before anesthesia so she offered me fruit juice to remove that bad taste, everything was fine after it without any discomfort. All meetings were painless and comfortable like this only and in 3-4 sittings she disinfected my teeth, filled them with Gutta percha and reshaped them to put crown on it. Her one assistant didi (sister) was also very supportive and helpful. she was removing excessive saliva through a device from my mouth during whole procedure. Right now I am not feeling any pain and I can eat anything without any sensitivity or discomfort. I am very happy and have recently submitted my dissertation, it was not possible without removing this severe pain from my teeth. Now I have just one appointment on Monday for fixing crown on both teeth. I am very satisfied with the treatment and whole process of it. It would look exaggeration to say this but I have never met such a calm, understanding and sweet doctor like Sravani Mam. I want to recommend Dr Sravani Mam for all patients who are suffering from any problem related to teeth like me. Don't be hesitant and scared about anything, just get the treatment, remove the problem and enjoy life. My big thanks to Sravani Mam for my proper treatment and patiently answering my all curious questions. All the best to her for her bight future !",

Hopefully the last one will also be removed in another week and then an implant beside the tooth will be placed which was emptied earlier few years ago. And as my teeths are shifting sides and making the tooth aesthetics look inappropriate. I am getting a bridge done soon. I may have mentioned the Doctor that I am not that sound financially hense, I may have to split the treatment accordingly. To whi h the Doctors was supportive and helped me hot down a plan so that the entire treatment can be performed appropriately in the due time over the course on an year. I would definitely recommend the. Linic and the Doctors specially. Also the medication being provided are mostly generic and very pocket friendly. Which should be applauded. ",

I was in pain from several days due to cavity in my two uper tooth. I used to have difficulty in eating or drinking any cold food and felt sensitivity. At the peak of the pain, I couldn't eat anything. Once I was in pain for whole night and couldn't get relief even after taking painkillers. I was very worried because I also had to submit my dissertation in few days and it was too difficult to do it with such severe pain. Next day I went to her clinic and told her my problem. After patiently and calmly listening to my problem, she made me comfortable and suggested me root canal treatment for both teeth which would take 3-4 sittings. I was very curious and had many queries in my mind regarding this procedure, she answered my all questions and explained everything in detail. I accepted her advice and started my treatment with her. On the first day I was very scared but she convinced me that I would not feel any pain in whole procedure due to anesthesia and if I feel any discomfort I just had to raise my hand. She was right. It was a painless procedure with full comfort. She was very gentle and carefull with the tools. Initially I did not like the bitter taste of Gel which is applied before anesthesia so she offered me fruit juice to remove that bad taste, everything was fine after it without any discomfort. All meetings were painless and comfortable like this only and in 3-4 sittings she disinfected my teeth, filled them with Gutta percha and reshaped them to put crown on it. Her one assistant didi (sister) was also very supportive and helpful. she was removing excessive saliva through a device from my mouth during whole procedure. Right now I am not feeling any pain and I can eat anything without any sensitivity or discomfort. I am very happy and have recently submitted my dissertation, it was not possible without removing this severe pain from my teeth. Now I have just one appointment on Monday for fixing crown on both teeth. I am very satisfied with the treatment and whole process of it. It would look exaggeration to say this but I have never met such a calm, understanding and sweet doctor like Sravani Mam. I want to recommend Dr Sravani Mam for all patients who are suffering from any problem related to teeth like me. Don't be hesitant and scared about anything, just get the treatment, remove the problem and enjoy life. My big thanks to Sravani Mam for my proper treatment and patiently answering my all curious questions. All the best to her for her bight future !",

Hopefully the last one will also be removed in another week and then an implant beside the tooth will be placed which was emptied earlier few years ago. And as my teeths are shifting sides and making the tooth aesthetics look inappropriate. I am getting a bridge done soon. I may have mentioned the Doctor that I am not that sound financially hense, I may have to split the treatment accordingly. To whi h the Doctors was supportive and helped me hot down a plan so that the entire treatment can be performed appropriately in the due time over the course on an year. I would definitely recommend the. Linic and the Doctors specially. Also the medication being provided are mostly generic and very pocket friendly. Which should be applauded. ",
