"Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I recently had a Root Canal Treatment at RootCosmo with Dr. Neethu Nanda, and the experience was absolutely outstanding! From the moment I entered the clinic, I was greeted by a warm and friendly staff that made me feel right at home.

Dr. Neethu Nanda is truly exceptional. Her expertise and gentle approach turned what I expected to be a daunting procedure into a smooth and comfortable experience. She took the time to explain each step, ensuring I felt informed and at ease throughout. The procedure was virtually painless, thanks to her skillful and meticulous care.

The clinic itself is state-of-the-art and impeccably clean, which further reassured me of the high standards maintained at RootCosmo.

If youâ€™re looking for top-notch dental care with a personal touch, this is the place to go. Thank you, Dr. Neethu Nanda, for your exceptional service and care!
