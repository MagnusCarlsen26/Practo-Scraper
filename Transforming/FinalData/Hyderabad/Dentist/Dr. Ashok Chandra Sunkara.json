See, everyone needs a good dentist in their lives. It has always given me jitters. And what makes it even more uncomfortable is the general attitude of the dentist towards their patient .  I found Dr Ashok  to be very professional and thorough at his work and at the same time so jovial, understanding and mild mannered. He makes his patients feel at ease the moment one enters his clinic. Same goes for his staff Rajeshwari, hema and other staff itself. I might not have been to any better clinics maybe but, I can say that this was the best dental clinic I've visited so far. The whole ambience there, the staff, the doctor, makes it so easy for a person like me to visit that place again.",

He makes his patients feel at ease the moment one enters his clinic. Same goes for his staff Rajeshwari, hema and other staff itself.

We were concerned as extraction can be painful and we had a bad experience in the past with another dentist. We met Dr Ashok Chandra first and he explained the process, took the X-ray and explained in detail the extraction process and how close the tooth to nerves and any side effects etc but also assured us it will be smooth. It was an excellent treatment. My wife felt no pain during the treatment. Thank you dr Ashok and team.",
