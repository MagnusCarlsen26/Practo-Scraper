- Straightforward & clear in his approach & thinking

In my opinion, Dr. Vinay is a very kind, patient, and supportive doctor. He offers the best advice, explains the procedure, acts quickly, and works to relieve tooth discomfort. He doesn't leave you waiting in the course of the treatment for too long.

My teeth were shaking so badly. I suffered while eating and drinking too. After checking my teeth, he said one of my teeth is in bad condition and going for removal is the best. The other tooth which was shaking too, he said that it was minor and just painkillers will do fine. He was right! The extraction was painless and I'm happy with that. Great dentist who knows what to do.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I visited Medics Dental Care for wisdom tooth extraction. Doctors here are friendly and explain things in detail. During the time of extraction, Dr. Vinay controlled my fear assuring he is in safe hands, thereby reducing anxiety.
He took time to clearly explain precautions to take care of after the treatment and to avoid future problems. Pricing is also affordable I can say. I fully recommend this clinic to everyone.
