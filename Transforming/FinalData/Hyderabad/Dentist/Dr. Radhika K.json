After searching for Dentist in Google I stumbled upon Shambhala. I scheduled an appointment for Zoom (teeth whitening) and met Dr. Radhika, a beautiful woman with a personality to suit. She was personable and informative on many topics related to cosmetic dentistry and dental maintenance.She was courteous and thoroughly educated that I immediately felt I needed to become a regular patient. With a problematic crown, I consulted with Dr.Surendra and Dr.Radhika who worked seamlessly together. They operated the dental practice with a spa-like quality which was calming, tranquil and efficient.  Dental treatments should be worry free and the environment of the procedures should support positive influences and negate stressors. They have reached a level of mastery that is needed and welcomed . This entire team from reception and finance  and dental examination is flawless. You'll receive a winning smile without undue stress or dental anxiety when you choose these professionals. Get you smile together at Shambhala Dental Spa and Wholeness",

Kudos for reading a human mind vigilantly  and helping it place at a comfortable zone initially and then proceed with an appropriate treatment and ensure a relaxing recovery post surgery is a highly positive sign in any medical practitioner.
