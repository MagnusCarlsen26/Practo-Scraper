She is very cordial in nature and very soft spoken. Dr. Pallavi's expertise and a willingness to listen and discuss my questions helped me to nullify my doubts and fear regarding my surgery. It\u2019s rare to find a senior surgeon like Dr. Pallavi with such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. Dr. Pallavi's Clinic - Sri Sai Dental Hospital is the to-go hospital for Dental care.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Pallavi for genuine dental care and treatment and becoming her patient!",
