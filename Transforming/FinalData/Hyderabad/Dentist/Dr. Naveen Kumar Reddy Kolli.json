Finally we went to a famous paedodontist in a prime location in Pune, who took many visits without any positive result and again asked us to go for general anesthesia.  But Dr Naveen Reddy \n in Hyderabad, with his expertise saved our daughter from GA and she was very much comfortable in getting the whole treatment done with just minimal visits.  We wholeheartedly thank Dr Naveen Reddy for the best treatment on a five year kid. Kid is happy after that without any complaints. Strongly recommend Dr Naveen for kids dental complaints.",

We went to many doctors in Pune, all of them asked us to for general anesthesia for the kid. We were very much scared in giving general anesthesia for such a small kid. Finally we went to a famous paedodontist in a prime location in Pune, who took many visits without any positive result and again asked us to go for general anesthesia.  But Dr Naveen Reddy \n in Hyderabad, with his expertise saved our daughter from GA and she was very much comfortable in getting the whole treatment done with just minimal visits.  We wholeheartedly thank Dr Naveen Reddy for the best treatment on a five year kid. Kid is happy after that without any complaints. Strongly recommend Dr Naveen for kids dental complaints.",
