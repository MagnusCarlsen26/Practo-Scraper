I visited the clinic multiple times in the past week for the treatment of my two teeth, one lower right and another lower left, which were causing a lot of inconvenience. Dr Aparajita treated me. She was excellent in diagnosing the problem and never had any ambiguities about the procedures of treatment. She not only explained to me about the problem explicitly, but also told me clearly during the treatment the medicines and other things she is using. I felt extremely comfortable during the multiple lengthy sittings as she treated with alacrity. She kept asking me whether I am getting any pain or feeling any discomfort repeatedly during the treatment. Her post treatment care was amazing, as she frequently enquired about the condition of the teeth. I liked her knowledge, confidence, energy and diligence which set apart a doctor from others in the profession.",

However, I showed to three highly recommended doctors before coming to Dr. Aparajita. All the other doctors were unable to identify the injury and sometimes looking to cross sell other services that were not relevant. In case of persistent pain, the only default option that they said was root canal without a second thought. When I came to Dr. Aparajita, within few minutes she was able to identify the fracture on my tooth and provided me a detailed understanding of the issue as well as treatment options available. For the first time I was told about the fracture- all other senior doctors within the practice failed to even identify the issue in the first place. Post this first visit, Dr. Aparajita was my go to dentist! My treatment included some minor procedures which were a breeze. Her treatment approach is not intrusive and taking the easy route but trying to assess the different options with the patient with pros and cons in short and long term which gives you comfort in the process and makes you feel part of the decision making. I saved my tooth ultimately with minor surgery rather than loosing it completely and didnt even have to do a RCT which was the only option provided by all other doctors. Highly recommend Dr. Aparajita to all dental patients in Hyderabad.\u00a0 \n",

The treatment options were explained very clearly by the doctor and a preparatory medication was also suggested. On the day of the Root Canal treatment, I was given the clear explanation of the process. Once the process started, the doctor found that the decay has not gone up to the pulp and hence I was not required to undergo the RCT. I was only given filling and advised to check the pain or sensitivity after the anaesthesia wears off. I am very impressed by Dr. Aparajita\u2019s professionalism and sound knowledge. Any other doctor would have gone ahead with the RCT even though it is not required. She is also very friendly and keeps you informed of the progress during the process. I strongly recommend her.",

She was friendly and professional, explained me problem, causes, solution (RCT) and reason behind choosing the solution so I was fully aware/educated about my issue. Dr Aparajita  has skilled hands in dentistry as during nearly 40 minutes of treatment procedure I did not feel slight pinch and also during the procedure she kept talking to me and explaining what procedure she s performing which felt good and gave me confidence. Now after the treatment I have got rid of my pain and my tooth is in very good shape. I would thank Dr Aparajit and also would recommend her to anybody who is looking for dental treatment.",

As for wait time is concerned, she mentions a lead time if any RCT procedure already going on, else she will ask to wait for 15-20 mins. Plus point, she makes sure to follow up on any issue long after treatment has been completed. She is the best there is as far as RCT or fillings/crown implanting is concerned.",

She was excellent in diagnosing the problem and never had any ambiguities about the procedures of treatment. She not only explained to me about the problem explicitly, but also told me clearly during the treatment the medicines and other things she is using. I felt extremely comfortable during the multiple lengthy sittings as she treated with alacrity. She kept asking me whether I am getting any pain or feeling any discomfort repeatedly during the treatment. Her post treatment care was amazing, as she frequently enquired about the condition of the teeth. I liked her knowledge, confidence, energy and diligence which set apart a doctor from others in the profession.",

                "review_text": "I injured my tooth while eating, early this year.\u00a0 I never felt a pain like that on my tooth and was sure something is serious. However, I showed to three highly recommended doctors before coming to Dr. Aparajita. All the other doctors were unable to identify the injury and sometimes looking to cross sell other services that were not relevant. In case of persistent pain, the only default option that they said was root canal without a second thought. When I came to Dr. Aparajita, within few minutes she was able to identify the fracture on my tooth and provided me a detailed understanding of the issue as well as treatment options available. For the first time I was told about the fracture- all other senior doctors within the practice failed to even identify the issue in the first place. Post this first visit, Dr. Aparajita was my go to dentist! My treatment included some minor procedures which were a breeze. Her treatment approach is not intrusive and taking the easy route but trying to assess the different options with the patient with pros and cons in short and long term which gives you comfort in the process and makes you feel part of the decision making. I saved my tooth ultimately with minor surgery rather than loosing it completely and didnt even have to do a RCT which was the only option provided by all other doctors. Highly recommend Dr. Aparajita to all dental patients in Hyderabad.\u00a0 \n",

The treatment options were explained very clearly by the doctor and a preparatory medication was also suggested. On the day of the Root Canal treatment, I was given the clear explanation of the process. Once the process started, the doctor found that the decay has not gone up to the pulp and hence I was not required to undergo the RCT. I was only given filling and advised to check the pain or sensitivity after the anaesthesia wears off. I am very impressed by Dr. Aparajita\u2019s professionalism and sound knowledge. Any other doctor would have gone ahead with the RCT even though it is not required. She is also very friendly and keeps you informed of the progress during the process. I strongly recommend her.",

                "review_text": "This was my first visit to any dentist and I must say it was a seamless & painless process. I was troubled by cavity/pain in one of my tooth for which I had visited  Dr Aparajita. She was friendly and professional, explained me problem, causes, solution (RCT) and reason behind choosing the solution so I was fully aware/educated about my issue. Dr Aparajita  has skilled hands in dentistry as during nearly 40 minutes of treatment procedure I did not feel slight pinch and also during the procedure she kept talking to me and explaining what procedure she s performing which felt good and gave me confidence. Now after the treatment I have got rid of my pain and my tooth is in very good shape. I would thank Dr Aparajit and also would recommend her to anybody who is looking for dental treatment.",

She doesn't give wrong treatment and will inform what is the correct on for us patients, including the budget for an RCT. She is not into revenue making. As for wait time is concerned, she mentions a lead time if any RCT procedure already going on, else she will ask to wait for 15-20 mins. Plus point, she makes sure to follow up on any issue long after treatment has been completed. She is the best there is as far as RCT or fillings/crown implanting is concerned.",

This gives confidence to the patients. She did the RCT almost painfree and after the treatment also there was not much pain. She explained the medicines to be taken, what those medicines are for. This is infact the first time I did not get any other side effects like stomach upset etc on taking an antibiotic. This is because the doctor checked with me on my usual side effects on taking an antibiotic and she prescribed tablets to avoid those side effects as well. I would recommend the doctor to everyone.",
