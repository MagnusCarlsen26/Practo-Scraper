Gone through few reviews across each of them few negatives. I choose Dantam Chintal location. Name and the reviews attracted me along with reasonable fees. First consultation I had my x ray of tooth and Dr Sneha explained me why it happened, what's to next. I was suggested for removal of two teeth and two root canals. Explained and showed different caps with there benefits,  pricing. I choose good quality caps. Initially planned all in two to three sittings for saving my time but I later preferred for one root canal , extraction,  cleaning one after one. Totally 9 sittings I think was there every 3 to 4 days. was given anesthesia for extraction, root canal job. Extraction was painless little pain for anesthesia and one day slight pain. was given pain killers, antibiotics initially. Later was asked to use only if pain is there. Dr Harsha was there for first time cap measurements. The way he handled looks like top experienced doc. He gave some suggestions to Dr Sneha and Team for cleaning of my teeth as priority before fixing caps.

I had to undergo the tooth extraction because I had no gaps followed by digital footprint and then applying set of aligners. But by that time the process started, everyone in my family and friends were thinking that I was wasting my money, time and effort in doing this. I was just committed to my words but totally shattered inside. During the extraction process I broke down. Dr. Sandeep as an orthodontist just asked me the reason and he just comforted me as if he is kind of a god father. He hugged me and said to be patient at least for 1 year and then show the world whether I were wrong in my decision. And now I am after 2 years: confident, satisfied, happy and cheerful. I have answer for everyone that my decision was correct. During covid time even, Dr. Sneha had called in person and asked to not to panic as clinic will operate with utmost safety and they had helped me in getting temporary retainers. Because I had completed just my tray during the lockdown and my new tray had not arrived. And guys! They did not charge me even for that.
That's my story. I would definitely recommend this clinic to people who want a smooth and hassle free treatment for them. And lastly thank you to Dr. Sneha and Dr. Sandeep.",2020-12-14 15:56:19,False,True,Subha,,,

"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Cavities,Scalling,",0,0,NO,"I am writing this review after 3 months of my root canal treatment. I had a small cavity in one of my premolars which I wanted to get fixed. Doctor suggested me for a root canal and post that capping over it.

It took 3 sessions for my root canal and one session for capping. My root canal sessions were all painful even after anesthesia. This was almost 3 weeks of work. Even after capping I was in pain for 10 days. Doctor told me its healing pain.

3 months after I still have consistent mild pain while chewing food. May be its still healing.

I could have gone back to doctor for this but there are a few reasons listed below which stopped me. * ***** ***** **** *********** ******* *** *** *********** *** **** ***** ** ****** ******* While placing the capping tooth doctor asked me to match the tooth color and size by showing it to me on a little mirror. It was not properly visible on it so I requested her to confirm herself if it goes well. I trusted her. And she said its all good.

Reality is not just the color, but the size of the tooth also does not match.

Charges for root canal: Rs. 4500
Chares for capping: Rs. 12000

I also got my teeth scaling done on last day and I forgot to ask for charges beforehand. **** ****** ****** *** ******* *** ******* ** * ***** *** *** ** ****** **** *** **** *** ** ***** **** ** ***** **** ******** When I went for billing doctor took a pause for telling the charges. ** *** **** ****** ** ***** *** ******* ** ******* *** **** * *** **** ***** * ******* ***** ******* ******* **** ***** *** **** *** *** ** ** * ****** ********* ** **** * ****** ******* **** ***** ** **** ****** ******* *** * *** ** **** *** **** ** ******",2021-10-09 06:41:49,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hello ,
I hope I could answer all the doubts you had over the call on the same day of this review.
This reply is for others going through your review on our page .
You have visited our facility in March and we have advised you for an RCT..
you have revisited us in July with pain in that tooth which was severely infected as you have delayed treatment for 4 months.
That is the reason we took three appointments for RCT as we cannot fill it until the infection comes down.(3 appointments along with crown fixing in a span of 10 days)
All the appointments were done under anesthesia ,
yes, you might have had pain during the procedure, if infection was very active.
About the price-you said u want to go with the best ..we fabricated the crown with an INTRAORAL SCANNER(very rarely available in any dental facility, for accuracy ,instead of gooey impressions)
-and from DENTCARE-best possible crown you can opt for.
alternatively, we have given price options starting from 2000INR.
And lastly we give enough time for everyone, for shade matching and acceptance of the crown .
yes in a mirror-only possible option without any color hue and saturation differences if seen in cameras and screens,(the small mirror is the mouth mirror used to show back teeth).
..and coming to the size of your crown ,
you had an RCT for a molar and you are comparing your tooth to a premolar which is definitely smaller in size.
And if you are comparing it with the opposite corresponding molar of the same jaw, the amount of structure remaining in your natural tooth after removing the caries, decides the size of final prosthesis to prevent fractures.
please consider the fact that all the teeth do not have the same anatomy.
also scaling visible stains if removable(if not fluorosis or smoking stains)-will be removed completely.
other than those-shade of the teeth wont change with basic scaling.
hope this helps,
thank you!",2021-12-25T10:48:12+0000,Dr. Sneha Lakshmi Nagineni

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,",0,0,YES,Dantam is a place where they charge for the treatment and not the no of visits made. In my case the infection remained for some time and they did not create any fuss or overcharge me. Instead I was given 3 to 4 dressings with no additional charge. The charges were all transparent. Though I found the crown charge a bit high but guess Hyderabad rates are pretty high as such compared to Bangalore. Doctor Harsha saw me first and did the root canal treatment. It was done well. Dr Naimisha completed the RCT on a different day and even gave me dressings as the infection persisted. Finally Dr Sneha fixed the ceramic tooth. I am most satisfied by the friendliness and professionalism of the Doctors and other staff. They have a parking space too so you need not fear your car being towed away. Thanks to Dr Surabhi who explained me all the does and don't. I strongly recommend Dantam for all dental treatments.,2021-07-20 14:30:17,False,True,Sudeepto Mukherjee ,,,

Issues as to why it didn’t work in the past and what could be solution to those issues. We found her so sensible and got completely convinced that she’s the right doctor to trust completely on.

Since then we had multiple visits for measurements etc and my dads denture is working well (he has some initial teething issues which we hope would sort out soon - I’ll confirm in this story once all fixed). Best things about Dr Sneha 1) completely engaged and focuses on precision 2) extremely patient in answering all queries multiple times 3) clinic feels like corona free for good hygiene measures taken.

you have visited us with a very bad oral hygiene and bleeding gums. we have suggested you to undergo deep cleaning of your entire mouth, and we have charged 3 k for the same. which is a very very very nominal price. 
coming to your follow up appointment for a filling ,yes we have different specialities in dentistry which deal with different treatments, and we do only speciality treatments (as in ,treatment wise distribution to that particular MDS doctor).The names of all the specialists available are prominently displayed in all the premises, along with registrations.
Even if  you have insisted the same doctor to do all the dental procedures, due to the lack this information, there is a particular protocol to be followed by us.
Hence, we did not entertain your appointment request.
As we maintain utmost transparency, the same was conveyed over phone to you, which made you upset...we at Dantam give a lot of care and attention to each and every one of our patients. and during these covid times,we did not stop treating patients and fulfilled our duties like we were supposed to do. hence your public bashing.
 our precautions and sterilization protocols are at the top notch which cannot be denied, and hence our ratings and reviews...it’s very unfortunate that even well informed  patrons like you could not understand all this and instead of approaching the dentist/clinic prior, for the same, just one sided opinion is posted.
we at Dantam try to educate all our patients and do treatments with complete consent...
please be well informed, clear all your doubts with your NEXT dentist(not us definitely) before concluding, and please maintain your oral hygiene well.
get well soon,
hope we could explain ourselves.
