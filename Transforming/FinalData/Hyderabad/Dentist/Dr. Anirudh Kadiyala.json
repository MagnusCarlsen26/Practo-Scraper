Dr. Anirudh has done re-root canal and fixed my teeth problem in single visit and I didn't experience any discomfort during and after treatment. Dr. Anirudh was very friendly and highly experienced Dentist. Also the hospital staff has made follow-up calls to know about my teeth health. It was really a good experience for me at Ak dental. Highly recommend this dental clinic and specially Dr.Anirudh. ",

But I was having continuous issues with those teeth and had paid so much for treatment and wasted my time. After knowing about AK Dental, I've visited the clinic and got treatment from Dr. Anirudh and I was really satisfied and very happy with the treatment. Dr. Anirudh has done re-root canal and fixed my teeth problem in single visit and I didn't experience any discomfort during and after treatment. Dr. Anirudh was very friendly and highly experienced Dentist. Also the hospital staff has made follow-up calls to know about my teeth health. It was really a good experience for me at Ak dental. Highly recommend this dental clinic and specially Dr.Anirudh. ",

But I was little hesitant, because I meet a lot of ppl due to my work. So he suggested invisible braces and they have everything about these braces. I've got these braces as suggested by them and now I've got perfect teeth with no discomfort. I've suggested this clinic to my cousin and she is also undergoing orthodontic treatment here.",
