Before meeting Dr.Teja I have visited 4 Dental doctors in the last 12years, there treatment made my oral health more worse. My front teeth are in zig-zag shape and my 3 corners of teeth are affected with Root canal and crowns were laid which lead to more cavities and gaps between my teeth. Whenever I have my food, food gets stuck in every corner. After meeting Dr.Teja I came to know I have severe gum issues, she explained everything with utmost patience and suggested Laser gum surgery. It took time to heal my gums, now my gums are in proper shape. Then in a step by step process replaced all my previous crowns in 3 corners. Now I have perfect teeth crowns where there is NO food lodging. After years I'm enjoying my after meal experience. I'm really thankful to her lfor the complete treatment. I highly recommend her for any sort of teeth issues. Clinic is very hygienically maintained at all times. Friendly staff, I'm satisfied with the whole treatment. 5 star service and hospitality.",

The moment we stepped in the clinic the experience was completely different and the clinic was very hygienic and were following all covid protocols and my parents felt at ease immediately. Doctor took enough time to diagnose and suggest appropriate treatment. Most importantly the personal connect with my parents and regular follow up with them is what impressed me the most. I highly recommend Dr Tejadeepthi gaaru and her team of doctors who are very professional *** ************** They use latest equipments during treatment and ensure it's a painless procedure. Dental problems are the most we as common people ignore....recommend say cheese clinic to all of you and sincere advice not to postpone your dental problems and try to get them treated at the initial stage itself......Thank you Say Chesse....",

She went by my feedback than blindly proceeding with the x-ray and that is when, it was found that a cavity was there in the aching tooth. She explained that root canal needs to be done. Again during the process, she didnt blindly gave me anesthesia but rather was asking me regularly if the RC process was painful. I had no pain and my root canal was done without anesthesia.\n\nShows excellent profesionalism --> I had appointments in the morning as well as in the late evening also, but whether its 10 AM or 9 PM appointment doctor maintains same energy levels and takes her own time to treat the patient. This is something that is rare in most of the doctors. Doctor has loads of patience and will clarify all the doubts with a smile.\n\nEconomical --> Few of my friends told me that their doctor never suggested them different variations of crowns but only the costliest ones. Whereas i was told about different types of crown and was given an option to choose and that too at a very good price. From whatever i have heard in my friend circle, Dr. TejaDeepthi charges relatively less.\n\nReachable --> Doctor is reachable in case if you need to clarify any doubts with almost no delay.\n\nOverall very happy with Dr. TejaDeepthi. There is no second thought of me recommending the doctor.\n",

I was smiling with my teeth closed, since there were few missing teeth, and in a group photo, people used to identify my horrid appearance clearly.  but now am so happy, that I can mingle with people easily and willing to take snaps /selfie. Thanks Dr. Deepthi for all your dedicated service\n\nI had also undergone RCT treatment in her clinic without pain. The doctor advised me to take pain killer, in case I had any pain, but it was unbelievably that I didn't experience any pain. Really a marvellous doctor.\n\nAm a physicist and a mathematical modeller. As a researcher, if we need to do such engineering, we really need to do an RPT,scanning and then arrive at the precision. She was able to do it just by looking at the x rays and the measurements through her fingers. I really appreciate her devoted abilities and her experience in doing such measurements.\n\nIf she was a cardiologist or a vein specialist, she would have saved several lives, with her precision\n\nLastly, I came to know from the treatment, that sugar levels starts decreasing with reduced bacterial infection, which I was not able to reduce using allopathic drugs. Am not aware of how, this happens, but to all diabetics, whose sugar levels cannot be brought down, I suggest u to do a complete cavity cleaning to remove the bacterial infection.\n\nThanks once again Dr. Deepthi\n",

Before meeting Dr.Teja I have visited 4 Dental doctors in the last 12years, there treatment made my oral health more worse. My front teeth are in zig-zag shape and my 3 corners of teeth are affected with Root canal and crowns were laid which lead to more cavities and gaps between my teeth. Whenever I have my food, food gets stuck in every corner. After meeting Dr.Teja I came to know I have severe gum issues, she explained everything with utmost patience and suggested Laser gum surgery. It took time to heal my gums, now my gums are in proper shape. Then in a step by step process replaced all my previous crowns in 3 corners. Now I have perfect teeth crowns where there is NO food lodging. After years I'm enjoying my after meal experience. I'm really thankful to her lfor the complete treatment. I highly recommend her for any sort of teeth issues. Clinic is very hygienically maintained at all times. Friendly staff, I'm satisfied with the whole treatment. 5 star service and hospitality.",

Doctor took enough time to diagnose and suggest appropriate treatment. Most importantly the personal connect with my parents and regular follow up with them is what impressed me the most. I highly recommend Dr Tejadeepthi gaaru and her team of doctors who are very professional *** ************** They use latest equipments during treatment and ensure it's a painless procedure.

She went by my feedback than blindly proceeding with the x-ray and that is when, it was found that a cavity was there in the aching tooth. She explained that root canal needs to be done. Again during the process, she didnt blindly gave me anesthesia but rather was asking me regularly if the RC process was painful. I had no pain and my root canal was done without anesthesia.\n\nShows excellent profesionalism --> I had appointments in the morning as well as in the late evening also, but whether its 10 AM or 9 PM appointment doctor maintains same energy levels and takes her own time to treat the patient. This is something that is rare in most of the doctors. Doctor has loads of patience and will clarify all the doubts with a smile.\n\nEconomical --> Few of my friends told me that their doctor never suggested them different variations of crowns but only the costliest ones. Whereas i was told about different types of crown and was given an option to choose and that too at a very good price. From whatever i have heard in my friend circle, Dr. TejaDeepthi charges relatively less.\n\nReachable --> Doctor is reachable in case if you need to clarify any doubts with almost no delay.\n\nOverall very happy with Dr. TejaDeepthi. There is no second thought of me recommending the doctor.\n",

I was smiling with my teeth closed, since there were few missing teeth, and in a group photo, people used to identify my horrid appearance clearly.  but now am so happy, that I can mingle with people easily and willing to take snaps /selfie. Thanks Dr. Deepthi for all your dedicated service\n\nI had also undergone RCT treatment in her clinic without pain. The doctor advised me to take pain killer, in case I had any pain, but it was unbelievably that I didn't experience any pain. Really a marvellous doctor.\n\nAm a physicist and a mathematical modeller. As a researcher, if we need to do such engineering, we really need to do an RPT,scanning and then arrive at the precision. She was able to do it just by looking at the x rays and the measurements through her fingers. I really appreciate her devoted abilities and her experience in doing such measurements.\n\nIf she was a cardiologist or a vein specialist, she would have saved several lives, with her precision\n\nLastly, I came to know from the treatment, that sugar levels starts decreasing with reduced bacterial infection, which I was not able to reduce using allopathic drugs. Am not aware of how, this happens, but to all diabetics, whose sugar levels cannot be brought down, I suggest u to do a complete cavity cleaning to remove the bacterial infection.\n\nThanks once again Dr. Deepthi\n",

I was very anxious about the dental appointment and any procedure as it always sounded very painful and hectic, but Dr. Tejadeepthi was very patient and spend a lot of time during the whole procedure with utmost care and communication. She takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice, which makes her a great doctor. \n\nMy treatment had multiple stages, teeth extraction, dental bridges and implant. Considering the whole procedure, doctor made sure to address all of them with patience, care and perfection.\n\nI highly recommend the doctor for everyone.\n",

She also proactively identified a potential future issue and suggested a remedy to avoid root canal. Most of all she is very friendly and made sure the experience is lovely for her patients. An awesome overall experience and now I know why she named her clinic \"Say Cheese\". Definitely brings a smile throughout the process and even after you left.",

Every one went to her. \nRCT was complicated but she handled very well. \nFor denture procedure she brought in a specialist and go it all done in record time. Also suggested us to not go for expensive denture as the expensive one was more cosmetic than anything. My uncle is 74 years old and doctor took care of him really well. \n\nVery very friendly and genuine. Takes the extra effort to explain and make us comfortable. Very clear about the cost the treatment will involve. \n\nMany times didnt even charge consultation fees. ",

She didn\u2019t charge a single penny after I made her lump sum payment.  She used to daily message me fir enquiring about my recovery.
