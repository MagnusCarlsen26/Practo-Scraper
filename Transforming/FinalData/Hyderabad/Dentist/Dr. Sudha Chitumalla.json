She is very professional, approachable and showed flexibility per my timings. I never knew I had cavities which could get worse if it was not addressed immediately. Dr.Sudha also suggested me about tooth aligners to get my tooth in shape, I liked the concept and went ahead with it. It also required tooth extraction, she was very patient and flexible during the extraction. Overall, I'm happy with Dr.Sudha and would surely recommend her. ",
