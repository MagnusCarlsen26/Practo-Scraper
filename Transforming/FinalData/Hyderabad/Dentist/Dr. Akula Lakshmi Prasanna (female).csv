"Value for money,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Surgical Tooth Extraction,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I went to Dr.Smiles for checking my wisdom teeth and sensitivity on one my other teeth. Dr. Lakshmi was good enough to examine the nature of my teeth, reason for sensitivity in one of my tooth and how it could be solved through home remedies without any treatment which was more helpful and satisfying solution. 

She also explained me about the issue with my Lower wisdom teeth’s nature of growth, issues that could come up in future and impact to other teeth. 

A quick X-ray around the table was taken and removal surgery was recommended for both my lower wisdom tooth with all required explanations which quickly helped me in taking up a decision right away.

Dr. Lakshmi was quick enough to find a surgeon immediately and arranged for the surgery in next one hour.

A detailed X-ray was taken and Dr.Abdul (Surgeon) was there in clinic with all required equipment to carry on the surgery. He explained me the procedure and patiently answered all my questions as I was quiet nervous about it. Things to take care post surgery was also clearly explained to my satisfaction.

The surgery started, I was given anaesthesia on local area and both my lower wisdom tooth was removed in an hour. Thanks to Dr.Abdul for his quick actions and closing the surgery in a smooth way. 

Dr.Lakshmi was having the precautions to take care documented in a detailed note and list of medicines and why those medicines were prescribed. These helped me in saving time post surgery.

I was kept aware of how the next three days would be and what precautions should be carried out during the time. These were really helpful in crossing the immediate next days post surgery.

There was call from Dr.Smiles on consecutive days asking about how I was doing and helped with my doubts I had.

An overall experience was smooth and I would say the Doctors helped me in crossing the hard days post extraction on a much smoother way.

On 5th day I got my stitches cleared and the surgical site was checked and ensured all are good.

Will recommend Dr.Smiles within Kondapur compared to other many dental clinics that are available in same location.

The cost is comparable and descent as per the enquiries I had with other dental hospital / clinic in Kondapur, Hyderabad.

Keep up the good work Dr.Smiles - Kondapur.
