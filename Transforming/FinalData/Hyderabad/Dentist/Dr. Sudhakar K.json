Doctor is very nice and he explained really well about the implants procedure and gave us treatment plan. Normally implants are very costly and not affordable. But here implant treatment is really affordable and they also give us additional discount. Although the price was on the lower side there was no compromise on treatment quality. The implants are of international brand and they also prove us with warranty. I would recommend 100% to all those looking for dental treatments.",

Dr Sudhakar explained clearly after examining my teeth which treatment suits best for my teeth with the help of some software. As my teeth are over crowded at some place and there were gaps in between, doctor suggested me to go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Although Invisalign is more convenient, he told it will take longer time to get the result compared to braces. So I finally decided to get braces and I don't regret my decision. Doctor has literally saved me from getting whole in the pocket (as Invisalign is much costlier) and also saved my precious time. I'm so thankful.",

The implants are of international brand and they also prove us with warranty. I would recommend 100% to all those looking for dental treatments.",

Dr Sudhakar explained clearly after examining my teeth which treatment suits best for my teeth with the help of some software. As my teeth are over crowded at some place and there were gaps in between, doctor suggested me to go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Although Invisalign is more convenient, he told it will take longer time to get the result compared to braces. So I finally decided to get braces and I don't regret my decision. Doctor has literally saved me from getting whole in the pocket (as Invisalign is much costlier) and also saved my precious time. I'm so thankful.",

Dr. Sudhakar was very meticulous when fitting the braces, ensuring they were comfortable and effective. During each follow-up visit, he adjusted the braces as needed and monitored my progress. The staff at AK Dental Clinic were always welcoming and supportive. Additionally, the wait time for each appointment was minimal. I never had to wait long to be seen, and the appointments always started on time. If you're looking for an affordable and effective teeth straightening treatment, I highly recommend Dr. Sudhakar",

There were many positives reviews for this one, so I planned my visit here by getting appointment online. I had consulted Dr Sudhakar and told him the treatment I've got in another clinic. As expected he told to get crowns and explained about the types of crows available. I asked for zirconia crowns. The staff took measurement and asked to come again after 5 days. On 4th day, they only called to remind me of the appointment and confirmed with me. Next day I had a smooth crown placement and it fitted well. It has been a week after that and I've no issues till now. I've to specially mention about the clinic ambience, it was simple and calming. The wait time was also short and staff are extremely friendly.",

At the first visit, I had consultation with Dr. Sudhakar and he did initial examination and explained about the treatment required. Doctor is calm and reassuring. Inspite of the high quality of treatment, the cost was very affordable compared to other clinics I researched. I suggest this clinic for everyone and definitely you will get the treatment absolutely valued for your money.",
