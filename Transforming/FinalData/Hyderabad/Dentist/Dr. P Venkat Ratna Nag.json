Before saying that Dr.Venkat is an extraordinary doctor, I want to tell Dr.Venkat that you are an extraordinary human being. Thanks for showing so much care and concern.\r\n\r\nSorry, My Name Suresh, working as a Software Professional and recently I met with an accident and lost my front right teeth and you know, I really did a lot of research in internet and visited  couple of hospitals to enquiry about the my teeth re-placement and few things that I heard on internet is IMPLANTS and BRIDGING.\r\n\r\nAfter I saw/read a lot of videos/articles in youtube/blogs on IMPLANTS and BIRDGING of pros and corns and I feel IMPLANT is best compare to BRIDGING but it will take at least 3 months of time, but as a software professional I don't have that much of time and mean while I cant smile in front of client/colleagues and it was really embracing to me.\r\n\r\nFinally I heared about Dr.Venkat is best for IMPLANTS and I visited to THE DENTAL SPECIALISTS hospital in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad and I had a small checkup and given a lot details and information about IMPLANTS and finally Dr.Venkat told that it will be done with in 30 mins...............I said Wow........and blown out my thoughts.\r\n\r\nDr.Venkat treating with modern and enhance technology with Fast and Zero Pain IMPLANT treatment and you know, he made it less than 30 mins and he made me smile :) with zero pain and the treatment is totally painless with less time.\r\n\r\nFinally but not least and I got option to get Reimburse this treatment because of RTA (Road Transport Accident)\r\n\r\nI also appreciate your staff for arranging tests, scheduling appointments and handling insurance procedures with seamless effort.\r\n\r\nSaying \u201cThank You\u201d seems so insufficient but I can find no words that truly express my feelings appropriately.\r\n\r\nFinally thanks for giving such a great experience in my life :)\r\n",

After a visit to this clinic all the fears i had about a dentist went in vain. It is a very comfortable and modern day clinic.\r\n\r\nAll the doctors were very co-operative and the staff was very humble and gentle. I liked the atmosphere both inside and surrounding the clinic. \r\n\r\nI recommend Dr. Venkat's clinic to everyone as i am certain that no patient at the dental specialists will return unhappy or in a unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nMy treatment though a long one did not seem so because of Dr.Venkat and his team of dental specialists. they are not only named the dental specialists but are proficient in their work and can take time out for helping any patient day and night.\r\n\r\nThe office is immaculate, the staff is super friendly, and prompt. Everyone seemed very educated and knowledgeable when they were explaining things to me. Will certainly be booking my next cleaning here!\r\n\r\n I'm so glad I went to him -- the atmosphere in the office is tranquil, he is really nice to speak with, he did not make me feel guilty about not coming to the dentist in over a year, and he saw me immediately! I highly recommend him!\r\n \r\nI went to Dr. Venkat as a recommendation from a coworker. She had extensive work done with her and had wondering reviews. Dr. Venkat was thorough and explained everything he was doing. He event asked when I needed to get back to work so he could fit within my schedule.Definitely a thumbs-up Highly recommmended!\r\n\r\nThank you for my new smile!\r\n\r\nEvery treatment I have had has been excellent. From a normal check up through to my recent cosmetic treatment (to even-up my smile), the dentist has been excellent! The dentist is always very clear & friendly & keeps track on my ongoing treatment.\r\n\r\nI recently asked if there was anything they could do to even-up my smile (having a baby tooth at the front of my mouth) and I was given 6 options in different price ranges, but the recommendation was actually for the cheapest option! I love my 'new' tooth and now feel so much more confident, plus people keep commenting on my smile!\r\n\r\nThere's a really personal service from everyone at the surgery. Even though it's a surgery, it feels like going to a local treatment where they have known me for years & know what I need!\r\n\r\n",

                "review_text": "After suffering from a bad set of teeth for number of years and due to the fact that the treatment in Australia is very expensive, I finally decided to look into international dentistry. \r\n\r\nMy biggest worry was a missing toot in front with a lot of bone loss and dentists in Australia suggested a bone grafting procedure which can be a very time consuming process. Also most of my tooth were very sensitive and needed either root canal procedures or extractions. Another important factor was the time I can spend overseas due to my employment commitments.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the testimonials and reviews on \u2018The Dental Specialist\u2019 I contacted the clinic and received all the answers for my concerns. Dr. Venkat recommended a full mouth rehabilitation and offered a ten day timescale to complete the procedure with a very reasonable price tag. Also, his implant technique does not require a bone grafting and can be completed in few days.\r\n\r\nDr. Venkat and his dental team were carried out all the necessary procedures in a very professional manner within the ten day period on a hygienically up to date clinical environment. One thing I noticed during my time at the clinic, highly appreciated and grateful for that when I stand in front of a mirror now, was the time spent by Dr. Venkat on varies fittings and adjustments to achieve his vision on how my set of teeth should look after the procedure. It felt like I am observing an artist who is completing a great art work.",

An introspection of various procedures; Root canal, Flap surgery, Implant (twice) which I have undergone over a decade testifies my delightful experience.  \n\nWhy I consider The Dental Specialists as a Dental Health Consultants for my family and me?\n\nWe have stumbled around a couple of clinics before we settled down here. Dr Venkat Ratna Nag adopts a tactical approach to the problem. His analytical ability to diagnosis, improved techniques in the procedure, a qualitative practice makes the patient feel comfortable, confident during the procedure and done-well feeling post treatment like that in my case. The updated equipment including Cameras and X-ray unit all in house, use of genuine dental material and above all the focus on the patient by the doctor and the supporting staff is remarkable. The environment is really a feel good factor; you don\u2019t feel you walked into a Dental Clinic.\n\n\nWhat made this Clinic an epic Dental Studio? \n\nThe Doctor couple chose the Pain of Disciplin in developing a Clinic into a studio therefore they are the successful practitioners in dental health care in the City. Qualitative approach will always drive efforts to desired results. The Doctor couple\u2019s relentless hard work to provide a holistic experience turns the pain into a smile. Availability of best equipment in house and a team of well qualified and experienced specialists differentiate this Studio from a conservative Clinic with a green colour curtain hanging on the door, a reception table outside and lone doctor inside a dingy room.\n\nDo I recommend This Studio to others?\n\nThe tolerance level in Health care is zero precision level. Thousands of thoughts invades a patient\u2019s mind before deciding where to go for his treatment. Perception leads decision making process. This perception becomes a reality post treatment. I am knowledgeable to the reality as one of most delighted patient. I highly recommend this dental Studio for all Dental Health consultations and treatments. Undoubtedly the treatment is affordable.\n\nPrasad. Duvva\nHyderabad",

Dr. Arshiya is one of such good doctors. Dr. Srirama is very informative and guiding towards preventive dentistry than just treatment oriented. Dr. Venkat, even if he is the Chief of this clinic, he is very soft and kind hearted. I am very much satisfied with their treatment. ",

After a visit to this clinic all the fears i had about a dentist went in vain. It is a very comfortable and modern day clinic.\r\n\r\nAll the doctors were very co-operative and the staff was very humble and gentle. I liked the atmosphere both inside and surrounding the clinic. \r\n\r\nI recommend Dr. Venkat's clinic to everyone as i am certain that no patient at the dental specialists will return unhappy or in a unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nMy treatment though a long one did not seem so because of Dr.Venkat and his team of dental specialists. they are not only named the dental specialists but are proficient in their work and can take time out for helping any patient day and night.\r\n\r\nThe office is immaculate, the staff is super friendly, and prompt. Everyone seemed very educated and knowledgeable when they were explaining things to me. Will certainly be booking my next cleaning here!\r\n\r\n I'm so glad I went to him -- the atmosphere in the office is tranquil, he is really nice to speak with, he did not make me feel guilty about not coming to the dentist in over a year, and he saw me immediately! I highly recommend him!\r\n \r\nI went to Dr. Venkat as a recommendation from a coworker. She had extensive work done with her and had wondering reviews. Dr. Venkat was thorough and explained everything he was doing. He event asked when I needed to get back to work so he could fit within my schedule.Definitely a thumbs-up Highly recommmended!\r\n\r\nThank you for my new smile!\r\n\r\nEvery treatment I have had has been excellent. From a normal check up through to my recent cosmetic treatment (to even-up my smile), the dentist has been excellent! The dentist is always very clear & friendly & keeps track on my ongoing treatment.\r\n\r\nI recently asked if there was anything they could do to even-up my smile (having a baby tooth at the front of my mouth) and I was given 6 options in different price ranges, but the recommendation was actually for the cheapest option! I love my 'new' tooth and now feel so much more confident, plus people keep commenting on my smile!\r\n\r\nThere's a really personal service from everyone at the surgery. Even though it's a surgery, it feels like going to a local treatment where they have known me for years & know what I need!\r\n\r\n",

                "review_text": "After suffering from a bad set of teeth for number of years and due to the fact that the treatment in Australia is very expensive, I finally decided to look into international dentistry. \r\n\r\nMy biggest worry was a missing toot in front with a lot of bone loss and dentists in Australia suggested a bone grafting procedure which can be a very time consuming process. Also most of my tooth were very sensitive and needed either root canal procedures or extractions. Another important factor was the time I can spend overseas due to my employment commitments.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the testimonials and reviews on \u2018The Dental Specialist\u2019 I contacted the clinic and received all the answers for my concerns. Dr. Venkat recommended a full mouth rehabilitation and offered a ten day timescale to complete the procedure with a very reasonable price tag. Also, his implant technique does not require a bone grafting and can be completed in few days.\r\n\r\nDr. Venkat and his dental team were carried out all the necessary procedures in a very professional manner within the ten day period on a hygienically up to date clinical environment. One thing I noticed during my time at the clinic, highly appreciated and grateful for that when I stand in front of a mirror now, was the time spent by Dr. Venkat on varies fittings and adjustments to achieve his vision on how my set of teeth should look after the procedure. It felt like I am observing an artist who is completing a great art work.",

An introspection of various procedures; Root canal, Flap surgery, Implant (twice) which I have undergone over a decade testifies my delightful experience.  \n\nWhy I consider The Dental Specialists as a Dental Health Consultants for my family and me?\n\nWe have stumbled around a couple of clinics before we settled down here. Dr Venkat Ratna Nag adopts a tactical approach to the problem. His analytical ability to diagnosis, improved techniques in the procedure, a qualitative practice makes the patient feel comfortable, confident during the procedure and done-well feeling post treatment like that in my case. The updated equipment including Cameras and X-ray unit all in house, use of genuine dental material and above all the focus on the patient by the doctor and the supporting staff is remarkable. The environment is really a feel good factor; you don\u2019t feel you walked into a Dental Clinic.\n\n\nWhat made this Clinic an epic Dental Studio? \n\nThe Doctor couple chose the Pain of Disciplin in developing a Clinic into a studio therefore they are the successful practitioners in dental health care in the City. Qualitative approach will always drive efforts to desired results. The Doctor couple\u2019s relentless hard work to provide a holistic experience turns the pain into a smile. Availability of best equipment in house and a team of well qualified and experienced specialists differentiate this Studio from a conservative Clinic with a green colour curtain hanging on the door, a reception table outside and lone doctor inside a dingy room.\n\nDo I recommend This Studio to others?\n\nThe tolerance level in Health care is zero precision level. Thousands of thoughts invades a patient\u2019s mind before deciding where to go for his treatment. Perception leads decision making process. This perception becomes a reality post treatment. I am knowledgeable to the reality as one of most delighted patient. I highly recommend this dental Studio for all Dental Health consultations and treatments. Undoubtedly the treatment is affordable.\n\nPrasad. Duvva\nHyderabad",

Thank God we didn't start our treatment in that hospital which doesn't even think from customers perspective.

I came here with a very complicated case of wisdom tooth which was hurting the in the lower jaw region and Doctors helped me to understand the situation & remedial measures.

He is aged 77 and to do implant at this age I had to be sure that I am at the best place and with the experienced doctor who is specialised in Implants. It took me 6 months of research to finalise this place. I booked appointment with Dr. Venkat who is considered as he best for Dental Implant in Hyderabad based on online reviews and from previous patients experience with him. I had a lengthy discussion with Dr.Venkat regarding my dads medical history and also his dental issues. I wanted to take it slowly and preserve as much as possible his natural teeth and go for minimum number of implants. He explained me what happened in my dads case and how the bridge made him lose his good teeth in long run. We decided to go for fencing to protect his frontal teeth and go with four implants. He did an amazing job with very little to negilible pain during the whole process. From there Dr. Ruthika took care of the dental imprint and regular check up to make sure everything is fine. What made it more special about the whole experience is the regular call from the front desk to make sure the patient health is fine and there is no pain or discomfort for the patient. It\u2019s once if the best experience I ever received from any Hospital or dental clinic ever.",

The clinic is very homely and fun with all young and energetic staff around. After treatment care is appreciated as they continuously keep in touch with me and ask if I am fine or not. They have always respected my age and took my adivises. I wish them all good luck and would like to refer this doctor to all my family and friends. ",

So they strategically completed about 60% of my treatment and the rest will be completed in the coming months on my next visit.\nI appreciate the work done by all the doctors, they handled my case very professionally.\nDr. Venkat ensured I was in good hands at all times. Flow of treatment, from initial check up to further consultations, went very smooth and as per schedule keeping my departure in mind. I find this place very comfortable and clean. \nI want to thank you all for being very helpful and kind.\nLooking forward to my next visit.\n\nRegards,\nMOEZ KANANI\n",
