"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Oral Surgery Procedures,Maxillo Facial Treatment,Oral Lesions Screening,",0,0,YES,"Following testimonial for Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy includes details of how we interacted with him for my mother’s treatment which I felt was necessary for me to convey the admiration for Dr. Reddy which I developed during the treatment and I hope this helps families like us to find the right care and treatment for their loved ones in time...

We came across Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy when looking for a Maxillofacial surgeon for a second opinion for my mother. We had consulted a local dentist at first who diagnosed ulcerations and prescribed a local application of an ointment. However, as the issue did not subside even after 3-4 weeks of continuous use of the medication, we decided to go for a second opinion. This is when we came across Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy. 
Dr. Reddy was very courteous and patient with us in trying to get to know the history of the ailment, the symptoms my mother was experiencing and what we had been doing to address it. Dr. Reddy upon his examination of the issue suspected it to be a squamous cell carcinoma and advised we get a few tests done to be certain of the diagnosis. It turned out to be the same and Dr. Reddy did not squander time anymore and was very transparent in his conversations with us and made sure we understood the illness and the treatment process. Reassurance from the doctor that this is nothing to be worried about and that we came to him at the right time was really comforting, a relief to know it would all be fine after the treatment is complete. The treatment was a 2-stage process where the tumour would be removed by a surgical procedure first followed by a full round of radiotherapy. 

We completed all hospital formalities to prepare for the surgery. Dr. Reddy was the surgeon and after the surgery was complete, he was very articulate in making us understand how the tumour and adjacent margins were successfully removed. Dr. Reddy also visited my mother in the hospital as part of the daily rounds to see how she was recovering and if there was a need to address any minor expected post-surgical issues. He was very supportive and positive in his consultations with my mother and this I feel played a major role as  this not only gave reassurance to my mother that all will be well, but also it gave us, the family, the mental strength we needed to remain positive in the situation and support my mother in her recovery. 
Dr. Reddy forewarned us that radiotherapy (RT) is the more complex part of the treatment which would require my mother to be patient and brave at the same time. He was also very proactive in sharing some medical articles on the illness and the treatment so that we wouldn’t rely on unverified online sources for the information and take unnecessary stress. The advice from Dr. Reddy helped my mother prepare mentally for the RT and it helped us, the family to prepare a plan as to how we would care for our mother during the treatment addressing any expected side-effects (darkening of the skin at the site, ulcerations in the mouth, loss of appetite, general weakness, etc.). Even during RT, Dr. Reddy advised us to visit him once a week for him to observe how my mother was responding to the treatment and if any medication would be required for the expected side-effects. There were times when my mother was experiencing pain due to ulcerations following RT and swallowing food became difficult. We informed Dr. Reddy about the symptoms immediately and he was kind enough to call us in his clinic the next day to examine the symptoms which shows he responds to urgency promptly, really does care for his patients and wouldn’t try to avoid any follow-up visits his patients might seek. The due diligence and care for his patients displayed by Dr. Reddy was truly motivational and very refreshing to see for me personally. All in all, Dr. Reddy has ensured all his patients experience very high standards of care and treatment at his clinic and I, have no doubts absolutely in recommending Dr. Reddy to everyone who are reading this testimonial to make sure their loved ones get the skilled treatment and care under Dr. Reddy’s supervision. 

To the patients and their families: Though it is easy to overlook but it is very important that in cases like my mothers’ it is very important for the patient and the family to be positive, motivated and show the courage required to conquer the illness. The treatment might be tough to endure but if you are able to remain positive, self-motivated, and courageous right through, you and your loved ones WILL emerge victorious from this. Just keep alive that zeal to live! and the courage to overcome all odds to spend many more years with your loved ones!

To Dr. Reddy: I have no words to say how grateful our family is to him for the care, patience and proactiveness he had shown during my mother’s treatment. Thank you, Dr. Srinivas Reddy, hope this testimonial helps others find the right care and treatment for their loved ones.",2021-07-09 12:29:54,False,True,Karthik Raju Gollapalli,,,

Srinivas Reddy  when looking for a oral surgeon for a second opening, I went to my regular dental clinic as I was having swollen gum and puss leaking from the back of my jaw teeth and upon examination and scans 1st doctor said it would need a surgery, didn't explain me what was the issue just said my wisdom tooth is very far  up in the jaw bone and its a major surgery  and  they had arranged a consultation with another oral surgeon who explained that its a cyst in my jaw bone which is causing the problem and I would need a surgery and It would cost some where about 2.2 lacs without insurance and if I my insurance is approved it would cost 1.2lacs. which has given me stress and sleepless nights they  looked online and found Dr. V. Srinivas Reddy and visited his clinic . He looked at my previous reports and explained me there is cyst and  its not major  problem but the surgery would come under major surgery as the location of wisdom tooth is very far and cant keep my open for so long and would be painful which cannot be operated under local anesthesia. I would need to go under General Anesthesia. Also explained there is a  nerve very close to the cyst which can impact my sensation on the lower left side lip and teeth.

Once I got the scan report he explained to me what is impacted and what would be possible post surgery recovery  stages and things I would experience post surgery. After talking to him I felt little relaxed.  On 14th Sep my surgery was done in Omni hospital and it went much smoother and faster than I imagined in my head. I had asked him to remove my other wisdom tooth as well while under anesthesia the day before. which he did.  My other wisdom tooth also was little further up close to my sinus socket.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"My wife was suffering with OKC symptoms two years back and we visited multiple dental hospitals near chandanahar and jubilee hills areas. Those are well established and well known dental hospitals. They could not diagnose the problem completely and did surgery to remove cyst. Since they did not completely checked, there was another cyst found inside once the first surgery completed. Again another surgery was done within a month duration. But, within 6 months when pain reoccured, we visited them again, they told cyst growth happened again in same location and this time it is more deep and spread. They asked us to get ready for another surgery. While we were not having clue on how to go about it, by gods grace, some one from our community suggested us to meet Dr Srinivas garu @ SmileTime dental, Kukatpally. While we already visited multiple bigger dental hospitals already, so, we were not sure on that advice, but, we thought, we will get opinion from Dr Srinivas and took an appointment and visited. Dr Srinivas, has gone through our past and present reports and checked thoroughly and explained in detail about the procedure to be followed. In fact, the cyst was present at 4 locations inside and not just at 1 or 2 locations. We understood that Dr Srinivas got tremendous experience with these kind of surgeries and almost weekly three or four days he will be dealing with these OKC and other related surgeries. We were very happy and very much convinced after talking to doctor. Surgery happened successfully on Oct 2021. The surgery cost as well was very much optimized with the help of Dr.Srinivas. We were very happy with evey interaction that we had with the doctor, prior to surgery and post follow-up s that we had post the surgery. Now it is 8 months competed after the surgery, my wife is not having any symptoms and not having any problems. Any one having OKC and related issues, please visit Dr Srinivas at SmileTime dental, Kukatpally, we are sure, you will get the best treatment and you will be happy that you are at right place and getting the best and correct guidance and treatment. Thank you so much to Dr Srinivas garu.
