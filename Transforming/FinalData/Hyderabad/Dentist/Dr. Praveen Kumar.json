I had absolutely no clue on how this treatment is undergone and Dr. Praveen explained very well initially and made me comfortable. It almost took close to 5-6 months to complete the entire treatment. Dr. Praveen was never in hurry and he took a good time to let my parents settle after every surgical process. The appointments were quite well planned and precautions during this covid time were also observed greatly.  He never was behind the money unlike other clinics but made sure the treatment goes well and patient satisfaction he kept as a primary goal. Always provided the right suggestions when we were worried after the surgical treatment. \n\nBoth my mother and father are satisfied and very happy with the implants. Although they cannot speak local language they both were never hesitant to visit the clinic alone. Doctor made sure they are still comfortable. \n\nOnly some of improvements i would suggest mainly during the surgical process.  Below are improvement around the surgical procedure.\n1. Getting the X-rays was a big time struggle for both my parents though my mother had gaggling issue.  So some alternative which can be improvised and make the process little easier.\n\n2. There was a little more time taken during first treatment to find the right size of implant however was already improvised with the subsequent appointments.\n3. Try and avoid to keep longer threads after the stitches. Also if the x-ray chip can be cleaned a little more frequently before taking x-ray. I know sometimes its difficult to do that but just a suggestion. \n\n4. Only one instance which really worried me was the one when there was already an implant placed and was plucked hard and the other one was placed in. There was a lot of bleeding for my mother. Though Doctor Praveen again gave the right suggestions and that reduced the worry and at the end was all fine. \nIt was a long journey of treatment as both my mother and father were getting treated. Overall an experience with Dr Praveen and the entire staff was very pleasing and satisfying. I would definitely recommend Doctor Praveen the way he treats and make his patients comfortable. \nMy parents have the same say as well. :)\n\n \n\n",

Dr.Praveen Kumar is an expert in the field and is friendly, Soft spoken and makes the patients comfortable with his Compassion. He is leading a Professional, Friendly, and  Highly Skilled Team of Doctors. \nOur whole family had our dental issues sorted out here. We are attended by Dr.Praveen Kumar, Dr.Sowjanya and Dr.Gowthami during our treatment i.e., Wisdom Teeth Extraction, Root Canal Treatment, Scaling, Polishing, Capping and other issues. \nThey did an EXCELLENT and AWESOME JOB. We are quite happy with the PAINLESS treatment and the care taken by them. They are all so friendly, helpful, compassionate and gave detailed information about the problem, cause of the problem, treatment being done and future care etc. And the treatment charges are MINIMAL and  MODERATE when compared to other Super Speciality Hospitals. Front office is Ably managed by one Mr.Prashanth who has coordinated our Appointments during our treatment. \nWe never imagined that a visit to Dentist will be so PLEASANT. After comparing our experience with our relatives and local Contacts we can confidently say that JODENT is the BEST PATIENT FRIENDLY DENTAL HOSPITAL in Hyderabad.

I had absolutely no clue on how this treatment is undergone and Dr. Praveen explained very well initially and made me comfortable. It almost took close to 5-6 months to complete the entire treatment. Dr. Praveen was never in hurry and he took a good time to let my parents settle after every surgical process. The appointments were quite well planned and precautions during this covid time were also observed greatly.  He never was behind the money unlike other clinics but made sure the treatment goes well and patient satisfaction he kept as a primary goal. Always provided the right suggestions when we were worried after the surgical treatment. \n\nBoth my mother and father are satisfied and very happy with the implants. Although they cannot speak local language they both were never hesitant to visit the clinic alone. Doctor made sure they are still comfortable. \n\nOnly some of improvements i would suggest mainly during the surgical process.  Below are improvement around the surgical procedure.\n1. Getting the X-rays was a big time struggle for both my parents though my mother had gaggling issue.  So some alternative which can be improvised and make the process little easier.\n\n2. There was a little more time taken during first treatment to find the right size of implant however was already improvised with the subsequent appointments.\n3. Try and avoid to keep longer threads after the stitches. Also if the x-ray chip can be cleaned a little more frequently before taking x-ray. I know sometimes its difficult to do that but just a suggestion. \n\n4. Only one instance which really worried me was the one when there was already an implant placed and was plucked hard and the other one was placed in. There was a lot of bleeding for my mother. Though Doctor Praveen again gave the right suggestions and that reduced the worry and at the end was all fine. \nIt was a long journey of treatment as both my mother and father were getting treated. Overall an experience with Dr Praveen and the entire staff was very pleasing and satisfying. I would definitely recommend Doctor Praveen the way he treats and make his patients comfortable. \nMy parents have the same say as well. :)\n\n \n\n",

However, the first meeting with Dr.Praveen Kumar sir is quite reassuring and all our doubts/fears are cleared. Dr.Praveen Kumar is an expert in the field and is friendly, Soft spoken and makes the patients comfortable with his Compassion. He is leading a Professional, Friendly, and  Highly Skilled Team of Doctors. \nOur whole family had our dental issues sorted out here. We are attended by Dr.Praveen Kumar, Dr.Sowjanya and Dr.Gowthami during our treatment i.e., Wisdom Teeth Extraction, Root Canal Treatment, Scaling, Polishing, Capping and other issues. \nThey did an EXCELLENT and AWESOME JOB. We are quite happy with the PAINLESS treatment and the care taken by them. They are all so friendly, helpful, compassionate and gave detailed information about the problem, cause of the problem, treatment being done and future care etc. And the treatment charges are MINIMAL and  MODERATE when compared to other Super Speciality Hospitals. Front office is Ably managed by one Mr.Prashanth who has coordinated our Appointments during our treatment. \nWe never imagined that a visit to Dentist will be so PLEASANT. After comparing our experience with our relatives and local Contacts we can confidently say that JODENT is the BEST PATIENT FRIENDLY DENTAL HOSPITAL in Hyderabad.  Thank you Dr.Praveen Kumar sir, Dr.Sowjanya madam and Dr.Gowthami Madam\ud83d\ude4f",

And next myself I have had a fear of dentists and was very scared to get the rootcanal done and asked him if it can be done painless.. As he promised it was totally painless...He explains everything and answers to each and every question with lots of patience..  Even during the procedure he explains everything What he is going to do... I would surely recommend him...Thank you so much Dr.Praveen.",
