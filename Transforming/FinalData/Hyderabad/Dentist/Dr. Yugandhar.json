I have visited national dental care for unbearable tooth pain,dr.Yugandhar garu & dr.sunehra has started looking into the issue & after examining 2 teeth are damaged they advised me to go for a rootcanal for 1 tooth and the other 1 was went for implant.\n\nI was very scared of doing Rootcanal but after starting the treatment I got to know dr sunehra is expert on it.\n\nforemost, i would like to commend your professionalism & expertise throughout the entire process.From the initial stage (consultation) to the final stage of the rootcanal treatment & implant treatment, you demonstrated a deep understanding of the procedure & consistently kept me well-informed and comfortable. Your ability to explain complex concepts in a clear manner made me feel at ease and confident.\n\nThe implant procedure itself was executed by dr\nSrinivas with utmost care.your attention detail and commitment to achieving optimal results were evident every step of the way. I appreciate the way you took the time to assess my unique situation of the treatment plan to meet my specific needs.your expertise & experiences shine through,and I felt reassured knowing I was in safe hands.\n\nAlso, I want to appreciate the exceptional care i received from you and your staff. Your team was friendly, accommodating and efficient, making each visit a pleasant experience. The clinic environment was clean and well maintained,creating a comfortable atmosphere that contributed to my overall satisfaction.\n\nAll the best for the team NDC\ud83d\udc4d",

I didn't find time to go back and get it treated. Later when i checked the prices. Treatment here is a costly than outside. Knowing all these I still took a chance and referred my in-laws for treatment there. *** ********* ** ********* *** **** **** * ***** ** ***** *** *** ********** When we took a step back they're speaking about the discount which they haven't provided me when I was treated. The patients who agree for the treatment will not get any discount here. If you say no to the treatment, thats when you'll get a discount. They do a lot of followups to get the treatment done.. they treat u so good that u can't say a no out of hesitation. They do a lot of followup for a 5 star rating on google reviews as well. When they handover the summary post treatment they'll for sure with a warm talk and nice smile ask for a 5 star review for which u hesitate again even to reduce a star.\n\nI'm not against the clinic.. just asking everyone not to fall for the behavior, respect, smiles, etc. **** ** *** ***** ******* ***** **** ******* It's we who should be mindful and compare the cost, treatment and follow up reviews and then take a decision. You're spending a lot of hard earned money for your dental issues. Its no wrong in thinking twice in an effort to save. Please don't go here looking at these reviews. These are all exaggerated. Consider the 1 star and 2 star reviews as well and think wise.",

I have visited national dental care for unbearable tooth pain,dr.Yugandhar garu & dr.sunehra has started looking into the issue & after examining 2 teeth are damaged they advised me to go for a rootcanal for 1 tooth and the other 1 was went for implant.\n\nI was very scared of doing Rootcanal but after starting the treatment I got to know dr sunehra is expert on it.\n\nforemost, i would like to commend your professionalism & expertise throughout the entire process.From the initial stage (consultation) to the final stage of the rootcanal treatment & implant treatment, you demonstrated a deep understanding of the procedure & consistently kept me well-informed and comfortable. Your ability to explain complex concepts in a clear manner made me feel at ease and confident.\n\nThe implant procedure itself was executed by dr\nSrinivas with utmost care.your attention detail and commitment to achieving optimal results were evident every step of the way. I appreciate the way you took the time to assess my unique situation of the treatment plan to meet my specific needs.your expertise & experiences shine through,and I felt reassured knowing I was in safe hands.\n\nAlso, I want to appreciate the exceptional care i received from you and your staff. Your team was friendly, accommodating and efficient, making each visit a pleasant experience. The clinic environment was clean and well maintained,creating a comfortable atmosphere that contributed to my overall satisfaction.\n\nAll the best for the team NDC\ud83d\udc4d",

I didn't find time to go back and get it treated. Later when i checked the prices. Treatment here is a costly than outside. Knowing all these I still took a chance and referred my in-laws for treatment there. *** ********* ** ********* *** **** **** * ***** ** ***** *** *** ********** When we took a step back they're speaking about the discount which they haven't provided me when I was treated. The patients who agree for the treatment will not get any discount here. If you say no to the treatment, thats when you'll get a discount. They do a lot of followups to get the treatment done.. they treat u so good that u can't say a no out of hesitation. They do a lot of followup for a 5 star rating on google reviews as well. When they handover the summary post treatment they'll for sure with a warm talk and nice smile ask for a 5 star review for which u hesitate again even to reduce a star.\n\nI'm not against the clinic.. just asking everyone not to fall for the behavior, respect, smiles, etc. **** ** *** ***** ******* ***** **** ******* It's we who should be mindful and compare the cost, treatment and follow up reviews and then take a decision. You're spending a lot of hard earned money for your dental issues. Its no wrong in thinking twice in an effort to save. Please don't go here looking at these reviews. These are all exaggerated. Consider the 1 star and 2 star reviews as well and think wise.",

The consultation fee and Xray charges are reasonable considering their maintenance and equipment. Doctor was friendly and tried his best to explain what he wanted to. Staff was courtesies too. These guys are no less than a corporate hospital.\n\nBut no where, except here, I have seen an X ray given on a paper but not on a film. Even the paper on which doctor has written his suggestions and the cost of the treatment had been taken by the reception staff and did not allow to take it with me and the reason they sited was patients are loosing the files and that's why they aren't giving it to them. To some degree it' could be a valid reason but there are plenty of options. Right ? They have everything online so nothing will happen even if a patient lost the entire file.\n\nAn other patient who got some treatment said that it was really of less pain and for those who don't bother much about money it's one of the best places.",

Based on the reviews on the practo we went to this hospital as a second opinion.  In the first meeting itself we were very much impressed by Dr. Yugandhar sir's approach towards the patient, very clear explanation and friendly nature.  It was covid time and we were skeptical about to get the treatment or not, but the hospital is very clean and maintains all the hygiene which is required during covid time.  As the issue was with the multiple teeth(6 crown and 1 implant) there was multiple sittings and the follow up by the staff of the hospital was awesome.   Thank you Yugandhar sir and the staff for the treatment provided.   Moreover the price for the treatment was also reasonable.",

First thing you notice here is the cleanliness and a lounge like waiting area..calms down your nerve immediately. You are offered mineral water and a cup of coffee by a smiling staff..take that..! You meet an expert doctor that explains you the process in every detail and removes any anxiety. You experience the  state of the art machinery where you can see the insides of your teeth on a LCD display. This was the 1st time I saw my teeth and understood the extent of the problem. Then you go through the painless experience during the treatment where they clearly explain at each step. At the billing time, you are pleasantly surprised to notice that they didn't charge you for consultancy, or X-ray...and they give you all medicines that they prescribed...free of cost. I am still finding it all hard to believe. All in all...5 Star Experience..!!",

At that time, they received us and Dr.Yugandar guided us well. And no consultation fee was taken at that instance. But  recently 2 days back we visited NDC again. Our experience was too bad this time..because we have taken appointment in prior but they even didn't have our number and name even after reaching the hospital. Felt bad about that. waiting time is too much. Finally consulted the doctor but this time..our experience with the doctor is too bad & we felt NDC became too expensive. Think once.Thank You!",

Surprised to see the doctor I booked the appointment is not available in seat, I had consultation with some young doctor. \nI was said to take X-ray to identify the issue. Taken it for a cost of 500/- and later they said to go for laser cleaning at the cost of 5K. \nI said that I need to take second opinion before attempting the solution they prescribed. \nWhen I requested to mention the treatment on Doctor\u2019s letter head, they denied it. \nWhen I requested for x-ray, they have printed it on a printer which has no clear print. \nNot a worth of visiting the clinic.
