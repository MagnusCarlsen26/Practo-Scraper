Even though I\u2019m late as my Child is a bit nervous, Dr. Tejaswi agreed to make an appointment as soon as possible. She had to take out one tooth and did very carefully and slowly, talking and playing with my daughter.The other thing I need to mention is that they really care more about the patients than about prices!!!",
