"Doctor friendliness,","Artificial Teeth,",0,0,YES,"Before visiting her, I was undergoing root canal treatment from another Dentist. But after going treatment for one and a half month, there was no relief, instead there was deterioration. I had been taking pain killers for more than one and a half month. Then I thought better to consult some Endodontist. Through Practo, I got her appointment. After thorough investigation, she started treatment. Today I am perfectly alright. She didn‚Äôt charge a single penny after I made her lump sum payment.  She used to daily message me fir enquiring about my recovery. Her nature is far from commerciaCharacter 
All the best to her",2022-04-29 12:47:58,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
