I feel like they provided a lot useful information in every one of our visits. Dr. Deepesh never rushes us, but always explains what is going on with our kids and what his recommendations are. Highly recommend this practice, specially if you have little ones who are nervous about seeing the dentist.",

Dr. Deepesh was extremely helpful and so patient! He made sure all the issues were discussed properly by asking different questions and making sure we did not have any doubts left unanswered. We got the cavities treated and filled and never once felt being rushed (which usually most doctors do!!) Sneha Ma'am helped with tooth cleaning and scaling with great patience and finess. They reach out for regular follow-ups to ensure the treatment is working and if there are any additional questions.Overall extremely satisfied and highly recommend Dr. Deepesh and his team for all kind of dental consulting.",

Dr. Deepesh was extremely helpful and so patient! He made sure all the issues were discussed properly by asking different questions and making sure we did not have any doubts left unanswered. We got the cavities treated and filled and never once felt being rushed (which usually most doctors do!!) Sneha Ma'am helped with tooth cleaning and scaling with great patience and finess. They reach out for regular follow-ups to ensure the treatment is working and if there are any additional questions.Overall extremely satisfied and highly recommend Dr. Deepesh and his team for all kind of dental consulting.",
