Even with the ongoing pandemic she agreed to meet me the next day. No wait time at all.She did a full checkup, showed me the xray results on tehnscreen which is right on top of the operating area.Exaplined all the issues to me - regarding my brdige, small cavities that were forming, plaque formation etc. Post explaining all the current issues she then moved on to carefully explaining and planning our a complete dental hygiene regime for me. I realised that why it is important to go the dentist regularly cause we may feel we are doing everything right but there is a reason why they are the specialists.Have visited many dental clinics before but giggles and Jyoti maam are league apart. Extreme care is taken to ensure that the clinic is safe during the pandemic. If you require dental examiniation Giggles should be your fisrt stopJyoti ma'am is fantastic!!P. S. : Will add more post my complete treatment.",

Even with the ongoing pandemic she agreed to meet me the next day. No wait time at all.She did a full checkup, showed me the xray results on tehnscreen which is right on top of the operating area.Exaplined all the issues to me - regarding my brdige, small cavities that were forming, plaque formation etc. Post explaining all the current issues she then moved on to carefully explaining and planning our a complete dental hygiene regime for me. I realised that why it is important to go the dentist regularly cause we may feel we are doing everything right but there is a reason why they are the specialists.Have visited many dental clinics before but giggles and Jyoti maam are league apart. Extreme care is taken to ensure that the clinic is safe during the pandemic. If you require dental examiniation Giggles should be your fisrt stopJyoti ma'am is fantastic!!P. S. : Will add more post my complete treatment.",

After examination, Dr Jyothi explained the condition in a very comprehensive manner and was very patient in answering my multiple queries during the process. I am really impressed with her inter-personal skills to involve her patients in a shared-decison making, as well as with the treatment she provided. She explained in detail the follow-up care that needs to be taken and also shared best practices to follow a healthy oral hygiene. \n\nFollowing my very positive experience, I took my spouse and child, and later, even my in-laws to Dr. Jyothi and Dr. Deepesh for regular check-up, and all of them are really satisfied with the treatment, care & guidance they have received.\n\nIn addition, I have to mention about the nice and organised set-up, clean ambience, and polite behaviour of all staff.\n\nI would definitely recommend their services to everybody",

So yes, unlike other dentists she won't just ask you to do some drastic procedures. \n\nWe found the clinic during a dental emergency and we've been loyal to them ever since.  Also, they have an LCD screen on top of the dental chair so you can watch videos during the treatment. ",
