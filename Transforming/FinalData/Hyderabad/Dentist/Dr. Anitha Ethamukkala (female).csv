"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Metal Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I went to Dr Anitha’s clinic for my daughter’s treatment after reading reviews online and I am glad we made the right decision. We had previously seen a dentist in KSA where half of her treatment for dental alignment was done. Ever since we moved to India we constantly received confusing remarks about the treatment she underwent , and most of the dentists we went to, said that the treatment was all wrong and will cost us a lot to get everything rectified.
Dr Anitha was the first and the only dentist who listened to our concerns patiently, who reassured us that nothing was majorly wrong with my daughter’s teeth and everything could be handled without worry. She is a highly skilled doctor, has very professional mannerisms and extremely kind towards patients and their families. A lot of dentists we consulted previously were only fees oriented  and didn’t really pay attention to our needs, Dr Anitha on the other hand has reasonable charges and will only do what is needed. My daughter kept asking her questions and she never hesitated in answering any of them. 
Me and my daughter are fully satisfied with the treatment we received and would recommend her to everyone else.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I am NRI, I treated abroad but I was not satisfied with abroad  treatment, one of my friend recommended me Dr. Anitha, 
I have undergone root-canal surgeries two times and fixed bridges and composite filling,from Dr. ANITHA. 4 years ago and still I have no isdues with her treated teeths. I Would highly recommend her to anybody who is in need of any dental procedures visit  her During consultation, she very patiently explained the procedures that had to be done. The only issue that really concerned me was the pain associated with these treatments, but Dr. ANITHA assured me that there would virtually be no pain at all. And contrary to popular belief, the root canal surgery  was almost painless. Her team is brilliant and they take utmost  care of you. 
I had to reschedule my appointments 3-4 times she was always at help. Definitely check her out if you are in need of any dental procedures.” I give her  Five Star5* Rated Review.  I found Dr. Anitha 's rates are very reasonable and fully satisfactory  guaranteed treatment . I introduced her with my  family, friends and in laws  they are all very happy and satisfied with her treatment and soft behaviour . I strongly recomend her, I am sure if you visit once to her clinic you will fully satisfied with her treatment and her behaviour.
