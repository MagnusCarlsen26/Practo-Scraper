I am happy that dhe understands patients needs rather than keeping her gains at priority. I would definitely consult her to maintain my dental health.",

Like many people, I too deferred my dental treatments thinking that they are too costly & are usually not covered by insurance companies.\n\nFinally there came a day where I had to bite the bullet, and see a dentist. And here comes our caring professional Dr. Nikitha, who is passionate about her work, and more than anything, someone who had that patience of a mountain.\n\nWhen I visited Partha Dental with a hesitation about the treatment costs, Dr. Nikitha examined my gum related issue, and explained me what the issue is, what needs to be done, how much it costs, and how many sittings would it take to complete the treatment along with her availability throughout the length of my treatment.\n\nDr. Nikitha maintains a transparent relation with the patients, and always let the patients choose what's feasible for them. Gives different options, and appropriate suggestions which put the patients at ease. She discusses the treatment costs accurately, and sets the right expectations at the very beginning of the treatment.\n\nWhile there was an old saying, \"We get our disease cured at the very first sight of the right doctor, although no treatment is done\", Dr. Nikitha stands as a true example for that (Especially in today's world).\n\nI personally recommend Partha Dental, especially Dr. Nikitha for her expertise, subject knowledge & a caring attitude.\n\n@Dr. Nikitha, thanks for being sooo kind and caring throughout my treatment sessions, and for treating my family members too.\n\nWe thank Partha Dental Team for having extra-ordinary doctors like Dr. K Nikitha, and I am happy that it's not just me, but my family members are happy with her treatment too.\n\nGood Day :)   ",

Like many people, I too deferred my dental treatments thinking that they are too costly & are usually not covered by insurance companies.\n\nFinally there came a day where I had to bite the bullet, and see a dentist. And here comes our caring professional Dr. Nikitha, who is passionate about her work, and more than anything, someone who had that patience of a mountain.\n\nWhen I visited Partha Dental with a hesitation about the treatment costs, Dr. Nikitha examined my gum related issue, and explained me what the issue is, what needs to be done, how much it costs, and how many sittings would it take to complete the treatment along with her availability throughout the length of my treatment.\n\nDr. Nikitha maintains a transparent relation with the patients, and always let the patients choose what's feasible for them. Gives different options, and appropriate suggestions which put the patients at ease. She discusses the treatment costs accurately, and sets the right expectations at the very beginning of the treatment.\n\nWhile there was an old saying, \"We get our disease cured at the very first sight of the right doctor, although no treatment is done\", Dr. Nikitha stands as a true example for that (Especially in today's world).\n\nI personally recommend Partha Dental, especially Dr. Nikitha for her expertise, subject knowledge & a caring attitude.\n\n@Dr. Nikitha, thanks for being sooo kind and caring throughout my treatment sessions, and for treating my family members too.\n\nWe thank Partha Dental Team for having extra-ordinary doctors like Dr. K Nikitha, and I am happy that it's not just me, but my family members are happy with her treatment too.\n\nGood Day :)   ",
