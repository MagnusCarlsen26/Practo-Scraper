The reception and support staff is quite professional in fixing appointments and sticking to it. They use latest apps for reminder and keep you updated with your appointment and schedules from time to time.\n\nIf you are looking at a dental doctor who does not create the hype about your treatment and just sticks to the basics and treats you with almost care, then this is the clinic you should visit.\n\n*** ***** ** *** **** ** ****** **** *** **** ***** **** I had visited the clinic multiple times and always had a good experience.\n\nThank you doctor.

The rates are quite reasonable when compared to most of the corporate dental doctors in the area.\n\nThe lab is well equipped and has all the facilities required. The waiting area is well maintained. The reception and support staff is quite professional in fixing appointments and sticking to it. They use latest apps for reminder and keep you updated with your appointment and schedules from time to time.\n\nIf you are looking at a dental doctor who does not create the hype about your treatment and just sticks to the basics and treats you with almost care, then this is the clinic you should visit.\n\n*** ***** ** *** **** ** ****** **** *** **** ***** **** I had visited the clinic multiple times and always had a good experience.\n\nThank you doctor.

Taking into account of the fluctuations in the sugar and BP, it was advised that the treatment need to be taken up immediately and accordingly the extraction was done immediately.  Immediately the removed dentures were supported by alternative temporary dentures. Later, the dentures were fixed in the next two or three sittings. The entire treatment was completed in six weeks during ten sittings for x-ray, extraction, temporary support and later for fixing the crowns duly grating the teeth and bridge the teeth with the support of healthy teeth.",
