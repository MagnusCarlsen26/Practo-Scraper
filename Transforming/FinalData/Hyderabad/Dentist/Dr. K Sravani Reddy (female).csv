"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"I am taking root canal treatment from Sravani Mam. She is very knowledgeable, understanding and sweet person. I was in pain from several days due to cavity in my two uper tooth. I used to have difficulty in eating or drinking any cold food and felt sensitivity. At the peak of the pain, I couldn't eat anything. Once I was in pain for whole night and couldn't get relief even after taking painkillers. I was very worried because I also had to submit my dissertation in few days and it was too difficult to do it with such severe pain. Next day I went to her clinic and told her my problem. After patiently and calmly listening to my problem, she made me comfortable and suggested me root canal treatment for both teeth which would take 3-4 sittings. I was very curious and had many queries in my mind regarding this procedure, she answered my all questions and explained everything in detail. I accepted her advice and started my treatment with her. On the first day I was very scared but she convinced me that I would not feel any pain in whole procedure due to anesthesia and if I feel any discomfort I just had to raise my hand. She was right. It was a painless procedure with full comfort. She was very gentle and carefull with the tools. Initially I did not like the bitter taste of Gel which is applied before anesthesia so she offered me fruit juice to remove that bad taste, everything was fine after it without any discomfort. All meetings were painless and comfortable like this only and in 3-4 sittings she disinfected my teeth, filled them with Gutta percha and reshaped them to put crown on it. Her one assistant didi (sister) was also very supportive and helpful. she was removing excessive saliva through a device from my mouth during whole procedure. Right now I am not feeling any pain and I can eat anything without any sensitivity or discomfort. I am very happy and have recently submitted my dissertation, it was not possible without removing this severe pain from my teeth. Now I have just one appointment on Monday for fixing crown on both teeth. I am very satisfied with the treatment and whole process of it. It would look exaggeration to say this but I have never met such a calm, understanding and sweet doctor like Sravani Mam. I want to recommend Dr Sravani Mam for all patients who are suffering from any problem related to teeth like me.
