I usually do not write any reviews, but the experience made me write this.\n\nAs everyone, I was always scared of hospitals and doctors, more so was scared with dental related issues due to my previous experience and the pain I had to go through. But my situation and health condition demanded that I visit a dentist. So, I began to search for a female doctor near by my home, so that I will be a bit more comfortable in explaining my fear towards dental issues. Accordingly, I reached out to Google and read many posts. I chanced upon a post regarding a dental care. I started reading more and post reading the google reviews, I decided that I would go to Sharanya Dental Care.\n\nWhen I met Dr. Sumedha the first time, she made me so much comfortable that I almost forgot about my condition. The way she treated me was awesome. She was so patient with me, answering my so many doubts and unending questions. She was very patient in listening to me and the way she treated was very professional. Initially, I imagined that I would have to go through lot of pain. But surprisingly, here was a doctor who seems to believe in pain-free treatment. After a while I was so comfortable with her and the most satisfying factor was the painless treatment. She explained me each and every thing in-detail on what I should take care. Even post treatment she helped me offline when ever I faced any dental issues without hesitation. Although the clinic looks not so spacious, it is right on the main road and easy to access and commute. As for the question that rises in every mind, she charges very reasonably, unlike many others.\n\nI really appreciate her work and patience. I definitely recommend her.",

I usually do not write any reviews, but the experience made me write this.\n\nAs everyone, I was always scared of hospitals and doctors, more so was scared with dental related issues due to my previous experience and the pain I had to go through. But my situation and health condition demanded that I visit a dentist. So, I began to search for a female doctor near by my home, so that I will be a bit more comfortable in explaining my fear towards dental issues. Accordingly, I reached out to Google and read many posts. I chanced upon a post regarding a dental care. I started reading more and post reading the google reviews, I decided that I would go to Sharanya Dental Care.\n\nWhen I met Dr. Sumedha the first time, she made me so much comfortable that I almost forgot about my condition. The way she treated me was awesome. She was so patient with me, answering my so many doubts and unending questions. She was very patient in listening to me and the way she treated was very professional. Initially, I imagined that I would have to go through lot of pain. But surprisingly, here was a doctor who seems to believe in pain-free treatment. After a while I was so comfortable with her and the most satisfying factor was the painless treatment. She explained me each and every thing in-detail on what I should take care. Even post treatment she helped me offline when ever I faced any dental issues without hesitation. Although the clinic looks not so spacious, it is right on the main road and easy to access and commute. As for the question that rises in every mind, she charges very reasonably, unlike many others.\n\nI really appreciate her work and patience. I definitely recommend her.",
