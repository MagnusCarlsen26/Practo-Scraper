Thought of removing all the teeth as i am not able to bear the pain.\n\nDuring all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out and multiple gum problems\n\n\n\nI know Dr.Venkat since early 2014, when i met him at his hospital as a final hope before removing all my teeths.\n\n\nwithin a span of few weeks i feel so comfortable and my problem got resolved which i am facing from my childhood\n\n\nI find that Dr. Venkat takes time to explain all the procedures. he explains all the pros and cons of the treatment so that I can make an independent judgment and he never apply pressure if \n\ni was not ready for the procedure.\n\n\nquality work has been done on my teeth.\n\n\nDoctor Never gave me any false expections , he was very clear with his work and if patient forces to do any treatment which he feels not required, he dont recommed that procedure.(Amazing doctor)\n\n\nThe professionalism and friendliness of the Doctor is outstanding\n\nTill today, I had no hint of any issues with my teeth and visit frequently for every 3 months for general check up\n\n\n\nMy sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr.Venkat my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.",

One moment he was talking to me how he will remove the tooth and in a minute it was out I didn't feel a thing. Of course afterwords medicine helps a lot too.\n\nImplants - I had two implants done by Dr. Venkatesh. This was done in within a 45 minutes. This is not about timing but also perfection.\n\nIn other words you can trust the consultation, judgment and cost here @ V DENTIS CARE.",

I've got a dental bridge perfectly done with 0% pain/post effects accommodating the veryyy short time i had on hand.\nDr. Venkatesh's friendly & serene demeanor does the trick for one to get the treatment done at peace without a second thought.Everything gets very well explained, the best options available for treatment, the procedure including post effects, care that needs to be taken etc if any beforehand. Clinic is Uber neat, well-equipped & staff is very cordial.\nOverall i surely recommend Vdentis ! Be rest assured that they treat your smile as their priority !\n\nThanks for everything and All the very best !",

Moreover, he is very friendly, explains every intricate detail of whatever he does, knowledged, organized and self-confident.  I underwent tooth extraction, rct, filling, crowning and scaling at vdentis, srinagar colony, hyd. As dental procedures are mostly associated with pain, here, utmost care was taken to eliminate pain at each level of my treatment. If any person is looking for an affordable and qualitative dental procedure, then vdentis is the right choice. Venkatesh garu!! I appreciate and thank you once again for restoring my tooth. Wish you all the very best.",

Thought of removing all the teeth as i am not able to bear the pain.\n\nDuring all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out and multiple gum problems\n\n\n\nI know Dr.Venkat since early 2014, when i met him at his hospital as a final hope before removing all my teeths.\n\n\nwithin a span of few weeks i feel so comfortable and my problem got resolved which i am facing from my childhood\n\n\nI find that Dr. Venkat takes time to explain all the procedures. he explains all the pros and cons of the treatment so that I can make an independent judgment and he never apply pressure if \n\ni was not ready for the procedure.\n\n\nquality work has been done on my teeth.\n\n\nDoctor Never gave me any false expections , he was very clear with his work and if patient forces to do any treatment which he feels not required, he dont recommed that procedure.(Amazing doctor)\n\n\nThe professionalism and friendliness of the Doctor is outstanding\n\nTill today, I had no hint of any issues with my teeth and visit frequently for every 3 months for general check up\n\n\n\nMy sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr.Venkat my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.",

One moment he was talking to me how he will remove the tooth and in a minute it was out I didn't feel a thing. Of course afterwords medicine helps a lot too.\n\nImplants - I had two implants done by Dr. Venkatesh. This was done in within a 45 minutes. This is not about timing but also perfection.\n\nIn other words you can trust the consultation, judgment and cost here @ V DENTIS CARE.",

I've got a dental bridge perfectly done with 0% pain/post effects accommodating the veryyy short time i had on hand.\nDr. Venkatesh's friendly & serene demeanor does the trick for one to get the treatment done at peace without a second thought.Everything gets very well explained, the best options available for treatment, the procedure including post effects, care that needs to be taken etc if any beforehand. Clinic is Uber neat, well-equipped & staff is very cordial.\nOverall i surely recommend Vdentis ! Be rest assured that they treat your smile as their priority !\n\nThanks for everything and All the very best !",
