As a patient, you need to be a bit more proactive and less generous, otherwise you'll probably end up waiting for a lot more time than required.\n\nBut again, I was really satisfied with the doctors there, so that's why I'd still recommend this place and specifically Dr. Sai Kiran.

As a patient, you need to be a bit more proactive and less generous, otherwise you'll probably end up waiting for a lot more time than required.\n\nBut again, I was really satisfied with the doctors there, so that's why I'd still recommend this place and specifically Dr. Sai Kiran.
