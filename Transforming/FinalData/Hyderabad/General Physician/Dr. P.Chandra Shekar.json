This was one of the negative experience. Doctor didn't see the patient or even try to diagnose him. Over a call, he was more inclined towards two things. Continue the same medicine and take him to hospital for a physical diagnosis. Since the patient is on a wheel chair it's difficult to take him out so we chose video consultation. Secondly it's well understood that we are continuing the same old medicine. I don't expect to hear neuro specialist saying this even before swing the previous prescription which was written by a general physician . My video consultation was mis leading and not actually a video call.  When I asked the same question doctor realized that he must do a video call to examine the patient after all the recommendation was shared. ** **** ****** * ***** **** *** *** **** ** ** *** ******* * ***** *** *** *** So what was the end result - nothing.\nDid i pay for the service - yes. \nWill i again consult home no\nDo i recommend the doctor to anyone- ******** *** ****** not at all\nDiagnosed the patient - No\n\n\n",
