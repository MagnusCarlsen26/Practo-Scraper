I completely fed up with my allergy and lost hope that this will continue life long. One day I strongly decided to investigate why this allergy is affecting me then one fine day I started reasearching good doctors again. During my reasearch I heard about life science homeopathy. Intially I dont have trust because of my last experiences anyhow decided to take one more try with life science. Trust me this doctor has vanished my 7 years of dust allergy problem in week. I was flabbergasted and felt very happy. Finally I found a true doctor. He is the only one can solve mostly all the problems in a very systematic manner. I strongly recommend everyone to take a test if you have any problems.,2021-01-03 07:21:45,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
