After reports came we did the follow-up consultation and he prescribed some medicines ********** **** ******** *** * **** ***** ****** ****** **** ** ******* *** ** ******. We decided to visit again after couple of weeks they charged another INR 800. During consultation when we told there was no improvement, he finally said there is a specialist in another hospital he knows and asked us to consult that doctor.  Basically, it is a way to compensate cost for the expensive hospital prescribing expensive tests and then just giving pain killers. He could have prescribed other doctor during the first visit but that would not have served the purpose.

The doctor sits in Arete Hospital ** **** ***** ***** ******** ** ************** The fees was INR 800 plus INR 200 for first time. After initial consultation he prescribed some tests which was done there and costed about INR 11K. After reports came we did the follow-up consultation and he prescribed some medicines ********** **** ******** *** * **** ***** ****** ****** **** ** ******* *** ** ******. We decided to visit again after couple of weeks they charged another INR 800. During consultation when we told there was no improvement, he finally said there is a specialist in another hospital he knows and asked us to consult that doctor.  Basically, it is a way to compensate cost for the expensive hospital prescribing expensive tests and then just giving pain killers. He could have prescribed other doctor during the first visit but that would not have served the purpose. Anyway, please stay away ** **** ****** ** *** **** *** ******** *** *** ** **** **** ******** **** *** ********  ",
