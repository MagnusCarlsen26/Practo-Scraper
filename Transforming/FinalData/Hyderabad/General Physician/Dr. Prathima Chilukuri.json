The way she explains things is very pleasing. She answers even the silliest questions you ask. My wife really wished she was her Gynaecologist who did the delivery. Her way of getting to know each and every problem from you is marvelous. She literally filled the entire page with just the observations from what she got from the conversation. She will not suggest more medicines as other doctors do. We are running short of adjectives to tell about our experience. Probably the best doctor we have ever seen.",
