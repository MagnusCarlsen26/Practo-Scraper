But the staff n lab incharge are very anxious n rude behaviour. They make us to wait for 3-4 hrs for only one Treadmill test which takes 10 mins time. They neither refunded my amount nor make the test.We suffered a lot with small kid of 3 years. Better to avoid diagnostic tests in aware global hospital. ",

But while waiting outside his room (quite surprisingly he keeps the door open to all keeping no privacy to a patient's diagnosis), we could see from outside that keeping the patient waiting even in front of him he was busy with multiple calls n WhatsApp chats and not to forget catering to MRs and clicking pictures with them. **** *** ***** ******* *** **** **** ** ****** * **** * ****** ***** *** ***** **************! After such a long wait, (and yes while we kept on waiting for the Dr to start talking to us, ** *** ***** **** **** *** ******** ********** ****** ** ******** we were ****** referred to the dietician sitting next room ******* ****** ****** ********* ** **** ******* ****** ******** ** ******* ****** *** ***** ***** **** *** ******** **** **** ****** *** ************** *********  Will definitely neither suggest anyone to visit this doctor nor will we ever visit him again *** ******** *** *********",
