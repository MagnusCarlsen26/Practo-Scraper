After our consultation with Mr.XYZ, the actual doctor came at 11:00am and read the lab reports suggested the medication.\n\nThe Doctor explained everything well, but, if he could manage himself in time will be appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

Though our comment i too early but still we wish to  make the first impression.\n\n  Doctor is very really friendly and feel that  has a human approach.  Spends time  with the patients which rarely see with other top doctors.  We really felt we approached the right doctor for our heart health.    We hope we never be disappointed in the days to come for our heart related problems.  we wish the doctor very best.\n\n",
