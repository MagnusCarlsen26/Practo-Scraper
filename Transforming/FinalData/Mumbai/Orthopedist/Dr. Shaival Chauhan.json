He is the modern indian doctor who doesn't make you fall in the trick of consuming extra medicines and conducting extra tests etc. Would recommend this doctor to anyone who is in pain and suffering.

Dr shaival chauhan performed microscopic disc decompression in my case due to which I was able to recover completely within 24 hours. I would highly recommend Sharan Hospital and Dr Shaival  Chauhan for anyone seeking treatment for back pain and spine pain. \n\nThe entire staff was very helpful and this is a very good set up for spine care .",

Initially we were very afraid about surgery but after meeting him the decision was very easy to make.\n\nHe is very transparent in explaining the procedure , he never insisted on surgery but at the same time he explained very calmly how the surgery is performed , how is the recovery and what precautions will be needed . \n\nThe amount of attention and care which we received here was very touching, it\u2019s a small set up but what I liked was they give a lot of individual attention to every patient , the doctors is very approachable and friendly . They even answer the smallest of doubts , which is very helpful because we were very afraid of surgery . \n\nLike any other patient , what we liked was , they treated us like family and it felt like a home out here",

So I travelled to bombay to get operated by him \n\nI am very glad I came here with this fracture because of the care I received at this hospital . I admire how relaxed they made me feel during my hospitalisation and my surgery was a big success . I started moving my hand the next day and I am very satisfied with my treatment . \n\nHe did his best at explaining the surgery and even drew a diagram of the steps of the surgery for me . \n\nVery few doctors explain so well and i am happy that I put my trust in him",

I was seen straight away and my surgery was completed the same day.\n\nDr shaival knowledge as an orthopedic surgeon is exceptional. I was not just pleased but extremely delighted. I am so glad I was in his care. \n\nThe hospital staff is a bunch of lovely people. Patient care is in their DNA.  Special thanks nurse Priya and Surekha. The busines manager Kashmiri is extremely polite and proffesional\n\nBeing a UK resident, I found the care at Sharan hospital similar to what I have experienced in London. There was one difference- Staff here took care of me as thier own. I highly recommend Sharan hospital. \n\n",

I found the doctor and his staff very professional. during a couple of previous consultations elsewhere I was advised surgery for my knee issues but Dr Shaival advised me to wait for a couple of months and started me on physio and some medications . Luckily I was able to avoid surgery. \nI would recommend him to anyone who wants a thoroughly scientific and professional opinion.",
