He didn't go for any xray as he was confident about the problem.\nHe advised me some exercises and minimum medicines.\nThe best part, I was always able to do my follow up online from my residing country. I highly recommend Dr Atul.",

After numerous visits to various doctors, she had decided that she won't undergo knee replacement surgery. But when we met Dr Patil, he explained the whole issue to her. He was thorough with his evaluation, kind, and informative. He suggested knee replacement for both her knees. But mom somehow agreed to go for right knee replacement. All this was done and agreed and within a week we went for operation in mid-March. Post operation he suggested physiotherapy. And today my mom is fully fit. She's goes for her walks and also climbs stairs. For any issues, Doctor is available to respond on phone or WhatsApp. Overall very happy with his treatment and would highly recommend him.",

After numerous visits to various doctors, she had decided that she won't undergo knee replacement surgery. But when we met Dr Patil, he explained the whole issue to her. He was thorough with his evaluation, kind, and informative. He suggested knee replacement for both her knees. But mom somehow agreed to go for right knee replacement. All this was done and agreed and within a week we went for operation in mid-March. Post operation he suggested physiotherapy. And today my mom is fully fit. She's goes for her walks and also climbs stairs. For any issues, Doctor is available to respond on phone or WhatsApp. Overall very happy with his treatment and would highly recommend him.",

Dr patil managed it very calmly and applied stitches on it. He explained us all the injuries in details at midnight and assured us nothing was serious. He did an emergency x ray at night where it was found that there was fracture around knee joint. Dr applied plaster and did all first aid management for that. \n\nSeriously i would recommend him for any bone related issues as he explains everything in details and patiently. ",

Today, only after two months since my surgery, I am very pleased with the results. The pain on my right leg has subsided. It feels like a miracle! My experience has been extremely positive. I credit this to the great effort and expertise of Dr. Atul Patil and his entire surgical team. This procedure has given me the ability to continue to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The result of my recent surgery is beyond my expectations. For any future patients that are experiencing decisions about this procedure, I wholeheartedly recommend it.  \u201d",
