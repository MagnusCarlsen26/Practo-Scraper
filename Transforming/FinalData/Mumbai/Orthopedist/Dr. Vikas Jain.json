For the past 30 days I was not able to walk, couldn't attend my office and literally I was  bedridden. My calf and back of thigh of left leg was very painful. We have consulted many doctors but could not be relieved of pain. Once I happen to see good  reviews of Dr.Jain on Practo and we decided to consult him once .We met Dr Vikas Jain and in first appointment only he made me very comfortable. After his consultation and doing MRI we came to conclusion that we have to  do surgery and I was operated by Dr Vikas for slip disc. It was successful operation and  I was able to walk on the second day of surgery itself and now I am  able to walk and sit properly. Troughout all appointments, surgery and routine check-up, Dr Vikas was so humble, friendly, ready to help any time and for that I highly appreciate him and want to recommend him for any spine related problem like slip disc etc.\n",

The spinal operation which Dr Vikas Jain performed on my mother was very very complicated but he performed it very well. My mother is in good health now. Dr Vikas Jains personal follow up with his patients is very good for example he called personally on my mobile number to inform me that he is out of country for one week and gave me the necessary instructions to follow up in his absence. He also asked me to call him or send a WhatsApp message if his mobile is not reachable. It very rare to see this kind of person attention given to a patient. I really appreciate Dr Vikas Jains kindness and his sincerity towards his profession.\n\nI would request ever one to pls once try Dr Vikas Jains treatment. He is very good doctor.",

For the past 30 days I was not able to walk, couldn't attend my office and literally I was  bedridden. My calf and back of thigh of left leg was very painful. We have consulted many doctors but could not be relieved of pain. Once I happen to see good  reviews of Dr.Jain on Practo and we decided to consult him once .We met Dr Vikas Jain and in first appointment only he made me very comfortable. After his consultation and doing MRI we came to conclusion that we have to  do surgery and I was operated by Dr Vikas for slip disc. It was successful operation and  I was able to walk on the second day of surgery itself and now I am  able to walk and sit properly. Troughout all appointments, surgery and routine check-up, Dr Vikas was so humble, friendly, ready to help any time and for that I highly appreciate him and want to recommend him for any spine related problem like slip disc etc.\n",

The spinal operation which Dr Vikas Jain performed on my mother was very very complicated but he performed it very well. My mother is in good health now. Dr Vikas Jains personal follow up with his patients is very good for example he called personally on my mobile number to inform me that he is out of country for one week and gave me the necessary instructions to follow up in his absence. He also asked me to call him or send a WhatsApp message if his mobile is not reachable. It very rare to see this kind of person attention given to a patient. I really appreciate Dr Vikas Jains kindness and his sincerity towards his profession.\n\nI would request ever one to pls once try Dr Vikas Jains treatment. He is very good doctor.",
