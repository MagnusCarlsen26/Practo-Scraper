Dr. Satyen diagnosed it as a disc herniation case and properly explained what was the underlying issue that was causing the excruciating pain. He advised to go with the minimally invasive surgery and explained the specifics of the same. After my surgery in USSH hospital, I was able to walk the very next day-with support; and in three days-without any support. Dr. Satyan embraces latest techniques and technology in surgery/ medical science, which helped me in solving the issues of my spine, and aided early recovery.Another great thing about him is that the way he communicates with the patients, instills confidence that we are in good hands. He calmly answers all the questions, no matter how trivial they are. I highly recommend Dr. Satyen for any spine/back related problem. Once again, thank you for helping me.",

I decided not to go for such a big surgery as my mom was around 60 years. Then I got to know about doctor Satyen Mehta and took appointment. He explained in detail on what can be done to make my mom standup and he did laser surgery which only took few hours. And only finger size cut on the back. After one hour of surgery he entered the room and holded my mom's hand asked her to stand up. i couldn't believe that she started walking. He saved my mom twice.",

He advised to go with the minimally invasive surgery and explained the specifics of the same. After my surgery in USSH hospital, I was able to walk the very next day-with support; and in three days-without any support. Dr. Satyan embraces latest techniques and technology in surgery/ medical science, which helped me in solving the issues of my spine, and aided early recovery.Another great thing about him is that the way he communicates with the patients, instills confidence that we are in good hands. He calmly answers all the questions, no matter how trivial they are. I highly recommend Dr. Satyen for any spine/back related problem. Once again, thank you for helping me.",

I decided not to go for such a big surgery as my mom was around 60 years. Then I got to know about doctor Satyen Mehta and took appointment. He explained in detail on what can be done to make my mom standup and he did laser surgery which only took few hours. And only finger size cut on the back.

He would always answer the call and solve all our queries patiently. It\u2019s very rare that a surgeon at his level who is always so busy takes such kind of personal interest in the patients well being. He is very kind, empathetic and encouraging. We had been to few doctors before we got to know about Dr. Mehta Sir. \nWe feel doing the spine surgery with him was the best decision we could have ever made! Such an excellent doctor and such a positive experience. Thank you Dr. Mehta Sir. \nWe will be strongly recommendation to everyone.
