"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Osteoporosis,",0,0,YES,He is very professional and his diagnosis was spot on. He guided us on the right treatment and also alerted us what to not to get swayed with. My mom had knee issues so besides treatment he guided us why we shouldn’t go for knee replacement which some others doctors may prescribe. Her knee was all good in sometime. When we were changing cities he got us in touch with the right doctor to continue the treatment. He even replied on emails when I needed help from the other city.
