At doctor's direction I went for TKR surgery of my left knee on 9th Jan 20, and discharged on 11th Jan.In these 3 days they practiced standing, walking staircase climbing ,really wonderful experience.Now 20 days over ,had good physiotherapy due to this I can walk and climb staircase without any support\nMPCT hospital has good staff and doctors especially Dr.Deepali Rathod,and staff Sonali madam and Yaksha madam are very service motive & other staff are also good\nI recommend MPCT to all required peoples",

But since the last 10/15 years, I am suffering from severe knee pain and am unable to walk. As a result, I lost self-confidence and confined myself to the four walls of my house. I did a lot of treatment, met quite a few doctors and many suggested knee replacement surgery but I was not convinced.  \n\nMy two sisters-in-law did their knee replacement surgeries with Dr Santosh Shetty and after seeing their progress and their confidence I approached Dr Shetty who explained the difficulties I may face later on and the benefits of knee replacement. \n\nFinally, I have gone through the right knee replacement and my knee which was meant inwards has straightened out making me feel much better. Waiting to get totally free of knee pain after my left knee replacement. I thank Dr Santosh Shetty for his guidance and treatment. \n",

At doctor's direction I went for TKR surgery of my left knee on 9th Jan 20, and discharged on 11th Jan.In these 3 days they practiced standing, walking staircase climbing ,really wonderful experience.Now 20 days over ,had good physiotherapy due to this I can walk and climb staircase without any support\nMPCT hospital has good staff and doctors especially Dr.Deepali Rathod,and staff Sonali madam and Yaksha madam are very service motive & other staff are also good\nI recommend MPCT to all required peoples",

But since the last 10/15 years, I am suffering from severe knee pain and am unable to walk. As a result, I lost self-confidence and confined myself to the four walls of my house. I did a lot of treatment, met quite a few doctors and many suggested knee replacement surgery but I was not convinced.  \n\nMy two sisters-in-law did their knee replacement surgeries with Dr Santosh Shetty and after seeing their progress and their confidence I approached Dr Shetty who explained the difficulties I may face later on and the benefits of knee replacement. \n\nFinally, I have gone through the right knee replacement and my knee which was meant inwards has straightened out making me feel much better. Waiting to get totally free of knee pain after my left knee replacement. I thank Dr Santosh Shetty for his guidance and treatment. \n",
