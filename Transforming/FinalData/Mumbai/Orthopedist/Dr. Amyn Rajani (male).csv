"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I am posting this review on behalf of my father,  Zoeb Zoomkhawalla, currently aged 84.

Here is his experience in his own words.
__________

I had been suffering from osteoarthritis in both the knees for 10 years, or more. I had consulted many doctors. All of them had suggested total knee replacement.

I was reluctant to undergo this procedure because I had come across cases which had failed. I continued with medication and exercise for a long time. However, these failed to give any substantial relief. The pain in my knees continued to worsen, and I reached a stage when the pain was no longer bearable and I could not walk for even two minutes.

I consulted Doctor Amyn Rajani, who also happens to be a family friend. After seeing my reports, he suggested a partial knee replacement for both knees. He assured me that I would be able to walk within two days from the date of the surgery. He also assured me that we could do the replacement for both the knees at one time. His assurance gave me the much needed confidence to undergo the surgery.

I underwent the surgery sometime in December 2019. As he had assured me, I was able to walk on the very second day. On the third day, I had discarded the walker and was walking unaided. Within one month of the surgery, I was able to take a short holiday. During my stay at the resort, I was able to climb the staircases very comfortably three to four times a day.

Over time, the movements have become more flexible and I am completely comfortable going on walks and climbing stairs.

Doctor Rajani has done a fantastic job and helped me to lead a normal life and get back to all my previous activities. I can confidently recommend him to anyone who has a similar problem.

When we met Doc Amyn Rajani he was very friendly and confident man. He described the procedure wholly. He took the time to make sure all her doubts are cleared by explaining the type of procedure and advantages of the system. We felt assured getting the surgery done knowing that he was very confident about the process. Finally my mother had a total knee replacement with Doc Amyn Rajani in Saifee Hospital . The surgery went smoothly . she was walking right after the surgery . her physical therapy started very next day and same continued at home right after she got discharged from hospital. She has no pain after few days and now she walks like a young lady. I would highly recommend Dr Amyn Rajani and his team..,2021-09-13 05:55:09,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

Unfortunately the treatment advised to you was for 9 days which would have ended on 17th of June, and you had been advised that incase of any emergency or excessive pain you will need to go to the emergency room of  the hospital and you will be attended to.
 
When the doctor met you for the first time on 8th of June 2020, he spent quality time with you explaining everything in detail, inspite of which you have kept messaging the doctor every day since your first visit from 8th June to 12th June, even without completing the course of treatment. 

Unfortunately,  if the doctor keeps replying to all messages, he will be on the phone the whole day, which is practically impossible.
