I was scared and nervous when you suggested a surgery for the issue. Which I think is common reaction when we heard the word \u201cSurgery\u201d. \nYou build the confidence and complete trust from the pre-entrance testing to post-surgery.\n\nI was impressed with the professionalism *** ***** **** ***** *** ********* *** ********** We were all accomplished by very professional, caring staff members. I have never had such a great experience with a medical team.\n\nYou and your staff should all be very proud of the service and care you provide to those of us that have parts of our bodies that just wear out!!  \n\nYou are a fantastic physician/surgeon, a wonderful person and you have a gift for making your patients really feel important & cared about. \nI will continue referring you to everyone I know.\n\nI am forever grateful to you.\n-- Ravindra  Malkasare\n",

Doc listened to the problem properly and guided me really well and explained my situation throughly. We decided to go ahead and do a surgery for the fracture and the bankart repair. After listening to stories from other friends who went through the same process and the pain involved, I was very sceptical. The surgery went very smoothly, literally no pain involved. From day 1 of the surgery, Dr Yajuvendra Gawai gave me excerises so that I wouldn't get a frozen shoulder which really boosted my confidence. The healing process has been smooth so far. I would recommend anyone to him! ",

                "review_text": "I visited Dr Gawai for my recurring shoulder dislocation problem. This time was different, I was in an accident and also had a greater tuberosity fracture. Doc listened to the problem properly and guided me really well and explained my situation throughly. We decided to go ahead and do a surgery for the fracture and the bankart repair. After listening to stories from other friends who went through the same process and the pain involved, I was very sceptical. The surgery went very smoothly, literally no pain involved. From day 1 of the surgery, Dr Yajuvendra Gawai gave me excerises so that I wouldn't get a frozen shoulder which really boosted my confidence. The healing process has been smooth so far. I would recommend anyone to him! ",

He suggested physio therapy and some medicine as my Vitamin D was also very low. After following Dr. Yajuvendra 's advice the pain has gone  and now i am fit and able walk more than 6km without any pain. I would strongly recommend Dr. Yajuvendra for any kind of sports injury , joint pains , back pain etc. ",

She appreciated Dr. Gawai's patience and his willingness to describe the entire process in two languages.",
