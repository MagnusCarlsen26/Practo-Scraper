,,0,0,YES,"My father aged 89 years had an unfortunate fall at home and broke his femur near the hip. Our family doctor whom we completely trust and go to for advice on all medical issues immediately recommended Dr Siddharth Shah. Dr Shah was very clear with his diagnosis. At the same time he was very patient and explained the specific issue with us and the mode of treatment going forward. Since it was an issue requiring immediate treatment he organised for the procedure to take place on a holiday at the hospital. I am sure the timeliness of the operation helped in ensuring better recovery for my father. In these COVID times with all hospitals taking extra care and restricting meetings between patients and their relatives, Dr Shah took extra effort in explaining to the nursing team to ensure proper care and attention to be given to my father in our absence during his stay at the hospital. Further, even for meetings, Dr Shah would come down and meet us in the lobby of the hospital to assuage all our apprehensions regarding my father’s condition and his progress. He would promptly and clearly respond to all clarifications sought on Whatsapp. Finally the proof is…my father is noticeably getting better and we are grateful to Dr Shah for his treatment.
