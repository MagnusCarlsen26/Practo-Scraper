These things matter a lot. Quite a caring doctor. May he be blessed with a long and healthy life so that he can heal more and more patients.\n\nIn today's world, it is difficult to find a medical practitioner who insists on saving money thereby recommending **** surgery.\n\nCan't thank you enough, Dr. Sachin Bhonsle :-)",

Then he claimed that there was a hairline fracture in her ankle joint and hence plastered it for 3 weeks making my slightly immobile mother completely immobile. Once the plaster was removed since the pain persisted,he then ruled out the cause of the swelling and pain was due to fracture. I think Dr Sachin was extremely insensitive and *********** in handling this case. When we subsequently went to other Orthopedic doctors, they all questioned the fracture angle.  I wouldn't suggest anybody to take their dear ones to this doctor due to the lack of a proper attitude towards diagnosis and treatment.  ",

Then he claimed that there was a hairline fracture in her ankle joint and hence plastered it for 3 weeks making my slightly immobile mother completely immobile. Once the plaster was removed since the pain persisted,he then ruled out the cause of the swelling and pain was due to fracture. I think Dr Sachin was extremely insensitive and *********** in handling this case. When we subsequently went to other Orthopedic doctors, they all questioned the fracture angle.  I wouldn't suggest anybody to take their dear ones to this doctor due to the lack of a proper attitude towards diagnosis and treatment.  ",
