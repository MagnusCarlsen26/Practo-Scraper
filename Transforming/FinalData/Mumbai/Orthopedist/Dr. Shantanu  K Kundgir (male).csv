"Value for money,","Sprain,",0,0,NO,I was quite glad to find a doctor on a Sunday to treat my wife’s sprained foot. However the billing process was a bit suspicious. Firstly the doctor said that they don’t accept Cashless and that I will need to get it reimbursed from practo. Also the plaster that he applied seemed a bit inflated cost wise. Earlier I was not being given a bill and was quoted 4400/- and when I insisted for a bill they hiked it to 4800/- with no break up of costs of plaster material. The date was also marked incorrectly on the bill whereas it was correct on the prescription. These kinds of issues (might be harmless) however draw suspicion.,2020-03-09 06:34:49,False,False,Verified Patient,Cleared u everything....I given bill with breakup...bill was not hiked it was 4700...don't misguide....thanks....,2020-03-09T13:45:47+0000,Dr. Shantanu  K Kundgir
