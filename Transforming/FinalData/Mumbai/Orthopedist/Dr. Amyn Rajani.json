He made the entire thing sound very small and answered all my query very nicely and softly. Knowing 4 other similar cases in my friend circle who were bed ridden for 4-6 weeks i feared i will also have go through the same. But the Doc assured me that i will be out of home (forget the bed) on 10th day. I can start going to my office and carry out all my routine activities without anybody\u2019s help.\n\nSurgery was done very nicely as told earlier. During the surgery also he explained me what was being done to make me feel comfortable. Next day, he visited me made me walk. I was amazed. He suggested a very good physio therapist and discharged me on the very next day of surgery unlike other doctors who insist on 2-3 days post surgery and physio after about 10 days. Needless to say that the physio suggested by him is also very thorough in her work \n\nEverything happened very smoothly as mentioned to me before the surgery. I was on my feet on the next day. In 3 days i was walking in the house without the walker. On 7th day i was allowed to resume office !!!! On 15th day i was allowed to drive....Wonderful. After ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair I never expected my life to become normal in 15 days.*** ***** ** *** **** **** **** *** ***** ** *** ************He is a cool person...very calm and smiling everytime i meet him.....\nVery confident of what he says and actually proves that to you.....*** ** ******** ** *** ********* *** **** **** *****************\nHe makes these fearful surgery sound like a game of cards.....\n\nI would strongly recommend him for any orthopedic related issues.\n",

I had consulted many doctors. All of them had suggested total knee replacement.\n\nI was reluctant to undergo this procedure because I had come across cases which had failed. I continued with medication and exercise for a long time. However, these failed to give any substantial relief. The pain in my knees continued to worsen, and I reached a stage when the pain was no longer bearable and I could not walk for even two minutes.\n\nI consulted Doctor Amyn Rajani, who also happens to be a family friend. After seeing my reports, he suggested a partial knee replacement for both knees. He assured me that I would be able to walk within two days from the date of the surgery. He also assured me that we could do the replacement for both the knees at one time. His assurance gave me the much needed confidence to undergo the surgery.\n\nI underwent the surgery sometime in December 2019. As he had assured me, I was able to walk on the very second day. On the third day, I had discarded the walker and was walking unaided. Within one month of the surgery, I was able to take a short holiday. During my stay at the resort, I was able to climb the staircases very comfortably three to four times a day.\n\nOver time, the movements have become more flexible and I am completely comfortable going on walks and climbing stairs.\n\nDoctor Rajani has done a fantastic job and helped me to lead a normal life and get back to all my previous activities. I can confidently recommend him to anyone who has a similar problem.\n\nZoeb Zoomkhawalla.\n__________\n",

When my daughter had a fall I took her to Dr. Rajani, he examined her and concluded that Ria had an ACL tear. He was so confident of his diagonosis even without us having done any MRI for her. He asked us to get the MRI done and the MRI confirmed the same. He made Ria feel very comfortable and explained the surgery in great detail to her and me. He made the entire thing sound very small and answered all my query very patiently. It gave Ria immense faith in him and was extremely calm when she underwent the surgery and the recovery was also very fast. His team of doctors and physio are also extremely compassionate and fabulous. From the second day Ria began walking and in 4 days Ria was walking and doing her chores without help. Thank you Dr. Amyn Rajani and his whole team....More power to you...",

A friend suggested Dr  Amin Rajani. This doctor explained everything in lay mans terms and made me feel comfortable. He is also an arthroscopic surgery expert.  I finally got myself operated at saifee hospital in May 2017. The Dr. Met my family before and after the operation . The Dr . Personally came the next day and made me walk. He doesnt leave things to his team of assistants. Takes care himself. Post operation also when I had to visit him , he personally removes the stitches rather than tell his assistants to do it. Answers all questions patiently. My family was very happy with him. Answers phones at odd hours. Always patient and understands thats patients would be worried. Gives choice of various rooms and packages. A lot of my friends have been operated by him and all are doing well including me. \nThanks doctor for taking utmost care.\nRegards ",

Needless to say after receiving rave reviews I decided to meet him.The moment I met Dr. Rajani , he completely put me at ease. After a thorough physical examination,he suggested MRI . His preliminary diagnosis was SPOT ON which was confirmed by the reports.After properly explaining what the options were available - a surgery (medial meniscectomy ) was suggested. Ordinarily I would have got nervous. But Dr. Rajani's confident,professional & humanistic approach allayed all my fears - to the extent that I was actually looking forward to the surgery. On 18th October 2016, surgery  \ntook place - & believe me it was a breeze. Infact on the same day in the evening when he specially came to see me, he made me JOG,JUMP etc.- and I was actually able do it without any pain. It speaks volumes about the confidence he has in his work.This confidence is infectious & actually makes you confident about the whole thing. I would definitely recommend Dr. Rajani - ******* ** ** *** ** *** **** * *** *** *** ********** **** ***  **** *** ** **** ****** *********** ********** **** ** ****  ",

Our family doctor immediately told us to visit Dr. Amyn Rajani. The first interaction with Dr. Rajani was very professional. Looking at her right shoulder and X-ray, Dr. Rajani told us that the right shoulder is damage very badly and surgery is required immediately. I remember my mom asking him one question \u201cWill I ever be able to have food with my right hand\u201d and his reply to that was \u201cyou will be able to move your right hand 360 degree\u201d. Dr. Rajani always keeps on smiling and because of positive vibe, we were confident that my mom would recover very fast. \n\nMy Mom underwent her right shoulder implantation surgery in April 2018. Dr. Amyn Rajani and his team are professional and extremely skilled. He was very co-operative and is a kind-hearted person.  After her discharge from the hospital, Dr. Amyn Rajani recommended my mom for Physiotherapy. In a matter of just over 9 months, she underwent a second surgery with Dr. Amyn Rajani for the removal of implantation. For the first time in her life she is happy with herself and she is on the way to speedy recovery. Her quality of life has improved, and all the credit goes to Dr. Amyn Rajani.\n",

He made the entire thing sound very small and answered all my query very nicely and softly. Knowing 4 other similar cases in my friend circle who were bed ridden for 4-6 weeks i feared i will also have go through the same. But the Doc assured me that i will be out of home (forget the bed) on 10th day. I can start going to my office and carry out all my routine activities without anybody\u2019s help.\n\nSurgery was done very nicely as told earlier. During the surgery also he explained me what was being done to make me feel comfortable. Next day, he visited me made me walk. I was amazed. He suggested a very good physio therapist and discharged me on the very next day of surgery unlike other doctors who insist on 2-3 days post surgery and physio after about 10 days. Needless to say that the physio suggested by him is also very thorough in her work \n\nEverything happened very smoothly as mentioned to me before the surgery. I was on my feet on the next day. In 3 days i was walking in the house without the walker. On 7th day i was allowed to resume office !!!! On 15th day i was allowed to drive....Wonderful. After ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair I never expected my life to become normal in 15 days.*** ***** ** *** **** **** **** *** ***** ** *** ************He is a cool person...very calm and smiling everytime i meet him.....\nVery confident of what he says and actually proves that to you.....*** ** ******** ** *** ********* *** **** **** *****************\nHe makes these fearful surgery sound like a game of cards.....\n\nI would strongly recommend him for any orthopedic related issues.\n",

I had consulted many doctors. All of them had suggested total knee replacement.\n\nI was reluctant to undergo this procedure because I had come across cases which had failed. I continued with medication and exercise for a long time. However, these failed to give any substantial relief. The pain in my knees continued to worsen, and I reached a stage when the pain was no longer bearable and I could not walk for even two minutes.\n\nI consulted Doctor Amyn Rajani, who also happens to be a family friend. After seeing my reports, he suggested a partial knee replacement for both knees. He assured me that I would be able to walk within two days from the date of the surgery. He also assured me that we could do the replacement for both the knees at one time. His assurance gave me the much needed confidence to undergo the surgery.\n\nI underwent the surgery sometime in December 2019. As he had assured me, I was able to walk on the very second day. On the third day, I had discarded the walker and was walking unaided. Within one month of the surgery, I was able to take a short holiday. During my stay at the resort, I was able to climb the staircases very comfortably three to four times a day.\n\nOver time, the movements have become more flexible and I am completely comfortable going on walks and climbing stairs.\n\nDoctor Rajani has done a fantastic job and helped me to lead a normal life and get back to all my previous activities. I can confidently recommend him to anyone who has a similar problem.\n\nZoeb Zoomkhawalla.\n__________\n",

When my daughter had a fall I took her to Dr. Rajani, he examined her and concluded that Ria had an ACL tear. He was so confident of his diagonosis even without us having done any MRI for her. He asked us to get the MRI done and the MRI confirmed the same. He made Ria feel very comfortable and explained the surgery in great detail to her and me. He made the entire thing sound very small and answered all my query very patiently. It gave Ria immense faith in him and was extremely calm when she underwent the surgery and the recovery was also very fast. His team of doctors and physio are also extremely compassionate and fabulous. From the second day Ria began walking and in 4 days Ria was walking and doing her chores without help. Thank you Dr. Amyn Rajani and his whole team....More power to you...",

A friend suggested Dr  Amin Rajani. This doctor explained everything in lay mans terms and made me feel comfortable. He is also an arthroscopic surgery expert.  I finally got myself operated at saifee hospital in May 2017. The Dr. Met my family before and after the operation . The Dr . Personally came the next day and made me walk. He doesnt leave things to his team of assistants. Takes care himself. Post operation also when I had to visit him , he personally removes the stitches rather than tell his assistants to do it. Answers all questions patiently. My family was very happy with him. Answers phones at odd hours. Always patient and understands thats patients would be worried. Gives choice of various rooms and packages. A lot of my friends have been operated by him and all are doing well including me. \nThanks doctor for taking utmost care.\nRegards ",

Later when I showed him my MRI TEST reports he fully explained me why and how it happened and how it can be reconstructed.\n\nHe made me feel very comfortable and explained the surgery in  detail. He made the entire thing sound very small and answered to all my query very nicely every time when I asked him. Surgery was done successfully. During the surgery he explained me what was being done to make me feel comfortable. Next day, he visited me made me walk.  In fact even post surgery he doesn't let patient go on his way. He got a amazing followup till the time he feels that the patient is fully recovered. In my case there was problem wherein my stitches did not heal. For which he had been continuously guiding me with the required medicine's and how to do the dressing for faster healing. \n\nIn short I would highly recommend him for any orthopedic issues.\n\nRegards\nHarish Nair",

His preliminary diagnosis was SPOT ON which was confirmed by the reports.After properly explaining what the options were available - a surgery (medial meniscectomy ) was suggested. Ordinarily I would have got nervous. But Dr. Rajani's confident,professional & humanistic approach allayed all my fears - to the extent that I was actually looking forward to the surgery. On 18th October 2016, surgery  \ntook place - & believe me it was a breeze. Infact on the same day in the evening when he specially came to see me, he made me JOG,JUMP etc.- and I was actually able do it without any pain. It speaks volumes about the confidence he has in his work.This confidence is infectious & actually makes you confident about the whole thing. I would definitely recommend Dr. Rajani - ******* ** ** *** ** *** **** * *** *** *** ********** **** ***  **** *** ** **** ****** *********** ********** **** ** ****  ",

When I tore my acl for the\nfirst time I was a little hesitant whether the operation was the only way to fix my acl. I consulted with 2 doctors in Mumbai and Dr Rajani. After all these inquires I had come to the conclusion of getting a Surgery. During the inquiry process with Dr Rajani, he was able to diagnose the problem without even looking at the MRI. He also suggested that I must do the operation immediately as I had spent one month confirming the injury. While the whole process was smooth I was a little nervous as this was my first operation but he made sure to give me the give me all the comfort and confidence I needed.I can happily confirm that my recovery went according to plan and even when I tore my acl for second time, the first person I went for an inquiry was Dr Rajani as had confidence in his ability .It was a good experience and I will definitely recommend Dr Rajani.",

Looking at her right shoulder and X-ray, Dr. Rajani told us that the right shoulder is damage very badly and surgery is required immediately. I remember my mom asking him one question \u201cWill I ever be able to have food with my right hand\u201d and his reply to that was \u201cyou will be able to move your right hand 360 degree\u201d. Dr. Rajani always keeps on smiling and because of positive vibe, we were confident that my mom would recover very fast. \n\nMy Mom underwent her right shoulder implantation surgery in April 2018. Dr. Amyn Rajani and his team are professional and extremely skilled. He was very co-operative and is a kind-hearted person.  After her discharge from the hospital, Dr. Amyn Rajani recommended my mom for Physiotherapy. In a matter of just over 9 months, she underwent a second surgery with Dr. Amyn Rajani for the removal of implantation. For the first time in her life she is happy with herself and she is on the way to speedy recovery. Her quality of life has improved, and all the credit goes to Dr. Amyn Rajani.\n",

He gave the comfort levels before and after surgery.  Subsequent therapy is going on... and I am sure everything will be fine.

It was a labral tear on my right shoulder, that required a surgery known as an arthroscopic Bankart\u2019s repair. Also there were large cysts in the shoulder capsule, which had to be decompressed. Choosing a surgeon is a very important step for a procedure involving sensitive parts like the shoulder joint. Once I consulted Doctor Amyn Rajani, * **** **** * *** ****** *** **** ****** ** *** ***** *** ** ******** He was quick to diagnose the problem even before seeing the MRI scans and extremely proactive in explaining the procedure. I went under the knife in January 2020, and now within two and a half months, my shoulder is almost back to full ranges and strengthening is the only bit left out. I sincerely thank Dr. Amyn Rajani and his team for their preoperative and postoperative care that made undergoing this surgery very easy for me!",

The initial days after the surgery were difficult but Dr.Rajani took good care and guided me well. It's been almost a year now and I'm physically a 100% fit with no complications. I shall always be thankful to Dr.Rajani for all his help, his guidance and his friendly approach that he provided to me.\nGod bless him. ",

He clears all doubts/ queries and explains the disorder and treatment protocol to the patient and caregiver in a very comforting and friendly manner.  Has a brilliant team that is very cooperative and efficient. Post-operative care has also been a good experience.

The first ortho who saw her advised a total knee replacement, we went for a second opinion and got in touch with Dr. Rajani. \n\nAfter going through the case he recommended a partial knee replacement. He took the pains of explaining in detail the implication, after care and differences of total and partial knee replacement. \n\nHis pleasing demeanor makes patients and caregivers feel safe and comfortable. Even post-surgery the way he hand holds and kindly sees the patient through on the path of recovery is commendable. And his impeccable sense of dressing is just icing on the cake. \n\nMy mother is back on her morning walks and pretty much does most of the tasks she used to do before the surgery. Highly recommend Dr. Amyn Rajani.\n\n",

Before visiting the Doctor my mother  could hardly walk for 20 meters without great pain...we came to know about Doctor Amyn Rajani through Practo and we are really glad that we did. After consulting him we opted for Saifee Hospital where she underwent the bilateral TKR... And today..after more than a year the condition of my mother is as different as day and night . The most unique quality about the doctor is that he understands the fears and concernes of patient and her family members.. on the first day itself he asked my mother if she is willing to undergo the surgery as it matters in terms of healing and recovery.... and he always always answers the phone which is sometimes really necessary... although bilateral surgery does take it's toll and she felt very weak for quite some time and during physiotherapy it does hurt.. there is no other option as such to get rid of the pain permanently.. .and after the operation within a week my mother started walking  with the help of Walker and after two weeks she could walk by herself....last time she visited us she could walk more than a kilometer .. we are glad we chose him for the surgery...\n",

After meeting him, I was happy and satisfied with the consultation and therefore decided to go ahead with the surgery. Within a span of 4 weeks I was back to normal without leg shortening, limping or pain. At present, I am following up with the Dr A M Rajani and physiotherapy. Infact I would confidently and surely recommend Dr A M Rajani to people who are looking forward for a hip or joint replacement.   \n",

Not once have I doubted on his ability and he has done a super commendable job.  He made me extremely comfortable & explained in details my medical issues.\r\nHe is absolutely precise in his diagnosis. He ran through the entire process of hospitalization/ surgery/ the no. of days stay in the hospital/ post surgery treatment.  \r\nNot only does he recommend a good physio therapist for post surgery exercise, he also continuously keeps in touch with the physio to check-out the patients progress. \r\nHe ensures that we keep up the follow-up appointments to check out the healing process.\r\nHe is always accessible whenever I had any questions or doubts on phone or what's App.\r\nWithout doubt, I would recommend Dr. Rajani strongly to anybody who has bone-related medical issues.\r\n",

The entire process, from first consultations till discharge went smoothly and I was  well informed about each step of the process. The post-operative physiotherapy was done by Dr. Meenakshi Punamiya with utmost care. Having everything in one place made it not only convenient, but also beneficial since the doctors knew exactly how my treatment was going. The staff members were helpful too.\n\nIt was a long process, but knowing I was treated by the very best in the field put my mind at ease. It went like a breeze and I am content with the results I see.",

He took the time to make sure all her doubts are cleared by explaining the type of procedure and advantages of the system. We felt assured getting the surgery done knowing that he was very confident about the process. Finally my mother had a total knee replacement with Doc Amyn Rajani in Saifee Hospital . The surgery went smoothly . she was walking right after the surgery . her physical therapy started very next day and same continued at home right after she got discharged from hospital. She has no pain after few days and now she walks like a young lady. I would highly recommend Dr Amyn Rajani and his team..",

His words \" if it was the case of his mother, he would go with only left knee\" is really touched me very much. He always do a favour to patient. Once you visit his clinic, you will came to know his achievement, records and most importantly a documentary movie showing the surgical procedure, comparison of before and after treatment of his past patients and many more useful informations. I must recommend Dr Amyn Rajani to all.\n",
