She immediately diagnosed me for Pericoronitis which was in a severe condition and she recommended me to Dr. Tejas Mhatre for the wisdoom tooth extraction. He is very young and seemed with not much with great experience but he proved me wrong. Generally, Every one wishes to go to a doctor with a grey hair for the sake of experience. I am very scared of Hospital treatments and was much more during extraction but Dr. Tejas Mhatre made me feel very relaxed and comfortable. He guided me about the process before very nicely. During the course of extraction, He asked if I was comfortable or not at regular intervals making me feel more confident. He gave an estimate of 30 mins but just when I thought the process has begun, he shocked me by saying \" Gaurav its done !! \" I was spellbounded with his expertise, high efficiency & Skill. He took mere unbelievably mere 9 minutes to do the extraction. He took utmost care of Hygiene & my comfort. Dr Tejas has a very pleasing personality, is extremely talented. My whole experience was completely painless. Later, I was having discomfort with the edge of the bone near the extracted area. Dr. Anviti grinded that portion and treated me well. She didnt charge anything extra for that :) ",

Now it was time of extraction & RCT.. I didn\u2019t expect the extraction of my wisdom teeth was done in just 15 mins n hardly any pain. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DR ANVITI.

She immediately diagnosed me for Pericoronitis which was in a severe condition and she recommended me to Dr. Tejas Mhatre for the wisdoom tooth extraction. He is very young and seemed with not much with great experience but he proved me wrong. Generally, Every one wishes to go to a doctor with a grey hair for the sake of experience. I am very scared of Hospital treatments and was much more during extraction but Dr. Tejas Mhatre made me feel very relaxed and comfortable. He guided me about the process before very nicely. During the course of extraction, He asked if I was comfortable or not at regular intervals making me feel more confident. He gave an estimate of 30 mins but just when I thought the process has begun, he shocked me by saying \" Gaurav its done !! \" I was spellbounded with his expertise, high efficiency & Skill. He took mere unbelievably mere 9 minutes to do the extraction. He took utmost care of Hygiene & my comfort. Dr Tejas has a very pleasing personality, is extremely talented. My whole experience was completely painless. Later, I was having discomfort with the edge of the bone near the extracted area. Dr. Anviti grinded that portion and treated me well. She didnt charge anything extra for that :) ",

She not only fixed my chipped tooth also she corrected my other teeth which were giving a bad look to my smile. She explained it to me why my tooth chipped off and how we are going to correct it also she explained it to me via videos how my other tooth also had few cavities. I immediately got it corrected and the expeirence was great. I am very happy with the consulation and the whole treatment is because it was all so systematic. For a person like me who is not aware of whats going on with my teeth and totally scared to visit a dentist, she has removed all my fear and since my smile has turned out to be better i am even happier.\r\nI would definately recomment her to all my friends,family and collegues. Thanks doc ! \r\nAnd also thanks to the staff for co-operating with my late appoinments. ",
