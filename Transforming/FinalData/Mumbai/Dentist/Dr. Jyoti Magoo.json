As he was a little anxious, we used the nitrogen gas and it worked like magic. He allowed doctor to do the fillings and followed all instructions soo well..even for my younger son, dr Jyoti explained the entire treatment to me so well and is always available on the phone to guide and help. One line which proves I made the right decision to take him to Dr Jyoti was my 5 year old son saying when we were leaving that this dental visit was much much better than he could imagine. Thank you soo much dr Jyoti for easing Jordyns anxiety as well as  mine :). I don't mind travelling all the way from Kharghar for the boys dental visits with you because it's totally worth the effort. Thanks once again. See you in December \ud83d\ude00",

Doctor Jyoti was sooo sweet and friendly with both the children, explaining exactly what she was doing throughout to both me and him.My older son immediately loved her and started talking alot. As he was a little anxious, we used the nitrogen gas and it worked like magic. He allowed doctor to do the fillings and followed all instructions soo well..even for my younger son, dr Jyoti explained the entire treatment to me so well and is always available on the phone to guide and help. One line which proves I made the right decision to take him to Dr Jyoti was my 5 year old son saying when we were leaving that this dental visit was much much better than he could imagine. Thank you soo much dr Jyoti for easing Jordyns anxiety as well as  mine :). I don't mind travelling all the way from Kharghar for the boys dental visits with you because it's totally worth the effort. Thanks once again. See you in December \ud83d\ude00",
