The procedure was totally painless thanks to good anaesthesia. The process of implants settling and gum healing went very smoothly, without any complications, which was confirmed by Dr. Vipin Mahurkar with a couple of follow-up appointments. During the most recent appointment, after the surgery, I was happy to hear from Dr Vipin Mahurkar that my implants are ready for the last stage-putting the makeup teeth with crowns and this procedure was done by Dr Pallavi Mahurkar, (cosmatic Dentistry & smile designing specialist).  Dr Pallavi and Dr Dhwani Kapadia were working patiently on me to give me replacement of missing teeth as well as my smile. Overall I\u2019m very happy with the work that Dr. vipin Mahurkar & Dr Pallavi Mahurkar and their entire team has done for me. I have been feeling great and more confident ever since the surgery. I couldn\u2019t have done it without Dr Vipin & Dr Pallavi's special skillset and support, so thank you!  I will highly recommend Dr Vipin Mahurkar  & Dr Pallavi Mahurkar to everyone who is afraid of visiting Dentist. ",

I came with my very own set of unique and challenging issues, that was NEVER too much for Dr.Pallavi, Dr.Vipin & Dr.Shraddha and their team to handle.\nAfter a blind examination, upon which my needs were identified and recommended action discussed (same needs as already outlined in my home country) we set about a plan of action. Much work was to redo a third parties dentistry previously undertaken in my home country, which had culminated in eventual destructive infections, cysts and additionally bone loss caused by that.\nDr.Pallavi (a renowned Dentist & Cosmetic Smile Design Artiste) Dr.Vipin  ( a renowned Dentist & Dental Implantologist), Dr. Shraddha (a renowned and deftly skilled dentist) and Dr. Ashwini (a renowned Dentist & Root Canal Specialist) partnered with the very able and peerless technician,  Mr.Wasim (a renowned Crown and Veneer Specialist), managed to work nothing short of magic on my infected and receding gums , broken, decaying and damaged teeth AND for a patient with a lifelong lack of confidence in my smile and teeth, managed to transform me, to give me a beautiful, entirely natural smile with the best quality porcelain veneers and crowns on the market today, priced affordably which allowed me a first-time confidence in my smile. A smile, I have NEVER had.\nFurther assisting this team was a group of assistants from Ziya who kept me organized with all the intricate timings and arrangements to Vaishnavi, Vishmita, Rani who cared for me and knowledgably and expertisely assisted with dental work at hand.   \nTo Dr. Pallavi and the Dental Team and her very able and professional dental assistants and office manager, my many many thanks and heartfelt gratitude for an experience that was superb and for giving me the opportunity to smile, in a way I hadn\u2019t done since I was a little girl, a long long time ago. \nThank you!\nWarmest and Sincere Regards,\nBernadette Collins\n",

The procedure was totally painless thanks to good anaesthesia. The process of implants settling and gum healing went very smoothly, without any complications, which was confirmed by Dr. Vipin Mahurkar with a couple of follow-up appointments. During the most recent appointment, after the surgery, I was happy to hear from Dr Vipin Mahurkar that my implants are ready for the last stage-putting the makeup teeth with crowns and this procedure was done by Dr Pallavi Mahurkar, (cosmatic Dentistry & smile designing specialist).  Dr Pallavi and Dr Dhwani Kapadia were working patiently on me to give me replacement of missing teeth as well as my smile. Overall I\u2019m very happy with the work that Dr. vipin Mahurkar & Dr Pallavi Mahurkar and their entire team has done for me. I have been feeling great and more confident ever since the surgery. I couldn\u2019t have done it without Dr Vipin & Dr Pallavi's special skillset and support, so thank you!  I will highly recommend Dr Vipin Mahurkar  & Dr Pallavi Mahurkar to everyone who is afraid of visiting Dentist. ",

I came with my very own set of unique and challenging issues, that was NEVER too much for Dr.Pallavi, Dr.Vipin & Dr.Shraddha and their team to handle.\nAfter a blind examination, upon which my needs were identified and recommended action discussed (same needs as already outlined in my home country) we set about a plan of action. Much work was to redo a third parties dentistry previously undertaken in my home country, which had culminated in eventual destructive infections, cysts and additionally bone loss caused by that.\nDr.Pallavi (a renowned Dentist & Cosmetic Smile Design Artiste) Dr.Vipin  ( a renowned Dentist & Dental Implantologist), Dr. Shraddha (a renowned and deftly skilled dentist) and Dr. Ashwini (a renowned Dentist & Root Canal Specialist) partnered with the very able and peerless technician,  Mr.Wasim (a renowned Crown and Veneer Specialist), managed to work nothing short of magic on my infected and receding gums , broken, decaying and damaged teeth AND for a patient with a lifelong lack of confidence in my smile and teeth, managed to transform me, to give me a beautiful, entirely natural smile with the best quality porcelain veneers and crowns on the market today, priced affordably which allowed me a first-time confidence in my smile. A smile, I have NEVER had.\nFurther assisting this team was a group of assistants from Ziya who kept me organized with all the intricate timings and arrangements to Vaishnavi, Vishmita, Rani who cared for me and knowledgably and expertisely assisted with dental work at hand.   \nTo Dr. Pallavi and the Dental Team and her very able and professional dental assistants and office manager, my many many thanks and heartfelt gratitude for an experience that was superb and for giving me the opportunity to smile, in a way I hadn\u2019t done since I was a little girl, a long long time ago. \nThank you!\nWarmest and Sincere Regards,\nBernadette Collins\n",
