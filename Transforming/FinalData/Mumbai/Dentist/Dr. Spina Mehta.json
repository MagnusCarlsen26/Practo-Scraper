Dr. Spina is a thorough professional and she went step by step:1.  She explained and examined the situation. 2. Took immediate measures to stop further damage to teeth. 3. She explained me the treatment plan.This review is after I got my Root Canal Treatment done, Dr. Spina spoke to me, comforting me throughout the Root Canal.. She explained the need to do it without anaesthesia. And true to her words, there was no pain after the treatment. Another wonderful thing is, she accepts online payments via Google Pay too which is really relaxing for people like me who hardly carry cash. I am pretty satisfied with the Doctor and she finished my treatment earliest on my request as I was travelling next week. I would definitely recommend her to my family members and even to other people. ",

Dr. Spina is a thorough professional and she went step by step:1.  She explained and examined the situation. 2. Took immediate measures to stop further damage to teeth. 3. She explained me the treatment plan.This review is after I got my Root Canal Treatment done, Dr. Spina spoke to me, comforting me throughout the Root Canal.. She explained the need to do it without anaesthesia. And true to her words, there was no pain after the treatment. Another wonderful thing is, she accepts online payments via Google Pay too which is really relaxing for people like me who hardly carry cash. I am pretty satisfied with the Doctor and she finished my treatment earliest on my request as I was travelling next week. I would definitely recommend her to my family members and even to other people. ",
