The treatment has made a huge difference to my teeth, and my life, and I have only Dr. Nilo to thank for it. She was extremely patient, cooperative and responsive with her work. Also, the treatment was relatively affordable as compared to the other doctors that I had consulted. All in all, a great experience! Would definitely recommend Dr. Nilo to all those looking for dental treatments in Mumbai.",
