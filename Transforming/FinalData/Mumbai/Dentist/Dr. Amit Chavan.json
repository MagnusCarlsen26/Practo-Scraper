                "review_text": "Hi, My names Chris and i would like to give you a brief insight or history of dental work I've had completed over the last 15 odd years and a testimonial on dental work that has just today been completed at Smile Again Dental Clinic at East Dadar in Mumbai India. By the time i was 45 i had been suffering numerous dental problems and had about 8 teeth missing from both the upper and lower jaw, luckily for me they were all back teeth and not visible from the front. Over the next 5 or so years these problems continued and led me to having more teeth removed and bridges fitted to both jaws. Over the next 9 years I had root canals completed, more teeth removed and the upper bridge had to be shortened. Then in  February this year the lower bridge broke away   due failing teeth. By this time I had had enough of constant dental work, minimal time between infections, pain etc. Amongst other things i could no longer smile, chew food and felt pretty miserable and embarrassed by it all. Knowing that removable plastic like dentures for the want of a better mame which I wasn't keen on were my only affordable option In Australia i decided to look overseas and find what was available. I then had some scans of my upper and lower jaw taken and sent these to different dental clinics in 3 countries I had chosen from my researching the internet.   From the replies, phone calls, quotes etc and further research I decided that India was were I would be heading. By the time I was ready to go I had been in contact with 10 clinics in India and had narrowed it down to 6, I made appointments with the 6 clinics for the 1st week to feel them out, get quotes and see what they suggested, of the 6 one was discounted at the 1st appointment leaving 5. After follow up appointments another 3 were discounted. I then chose Smile Again for numerous reasons such as professionalism, truthfulness, clinic amenities and general feeling about the staff and Dr Amit. Well after 2 visits over 6 months I have finished my treatment and couldn't be more happier with the results. I would like to thank Dr Amit and the staff for everything and am contactable through the Dr if you want further information from me.",

Together you make a great team and have been extremely caring & compassionate, and have the desire to make your patients happy with the results.\n\nI visited Smile Again - my first visit to a dentist ever - to get my teeth cleaned and get dental braces. A true professional that he is, Dr Amit Chavan patiently made me aware of several of my persistent dental problems, which I had been practically ignoring my entire life. He listened to my concerns and addressed them in a compassionate and professional manner. Later based on the tests and dental x-rays, he recommended Cosmetic Dentistry as an alternative to dental braces.\n\nThis is when Dr Dhruti Raut Chavan stepped in to give me a complete transformation, that too in just 4 sittings. Thank you! I owe you a big one for putting the smile back on my face at the age of 40... true to the name of your clinic 'Smile Again'!\n\nTo top it, Smile Again is very clean and nicely organized. What's also noteworthy is the sunny yellow coloured interiors that exude warmth and instantly cheers you up and the amazing fan at the reception that's symbolic of the mouth mirror - very conceptual and piece of art! also, the whole staff is super friendly and make you feel comfortable during your whole visit.\n\nYou will always be my dentist, and even though I will be living hundreds of miles away, I will come down to Smile Again, for all of my dental needs. \n\nThank you for always smiling and for spreading smiles :)\n\nWarm regards and best wishes always,\nSarita",

Kudos to Dr Lubaina who is a thorough professional at her work, understand the patient\u2019s requirement and treats accordingly. \nDuring the initial consultation with Dr Amit Chavan he took me through the entire process involved in setting my teeth right, and I thought it was great in terms of giving me the much-required confidence.\nOverall a superb experience and my gratitude towards Dr Amit Chavan, Dr Lubaina Tapia and the team of assistants who took care of me and gave a fantastic experience and more importantly removed the fear in me in the first sitting.   \nThank You once again to give back my SMILE \ud83d\ude0a \n",

The thouroness of the work was fantastic and I had minimal/no pain during this period.\nThe the next part of the treatment was to insert.the cement onto the filling and complete the root filling, this was carried out by Dr. Lubaina and she was excellent in doing this phase of the treatment and also explained the work being done and also advices on the nest stage that needed to be done, this was to place a cap on the filling. Unfortunately I was unable to have the cap inserted to to my insufficient time in Mumbai.\nI would like to thank Dr\u2019s Amit, Hitesh, Lubaina and all the wonderful supporting staff.\nI would have no reservation in recommending Dr. Amit and his team for dental care.\n",

I was very pleased the way the appointment went through this app.\nI selected a vicinity close to my residence for the treatment needed, on visiting i was treated in a very professional manner on recommendation to go in for a root canal i opted for it and spoke to Dr. Amit himself who explained me the process in detail . I was given a package of Rs.3500/- plus the cap as per choice and told this would take around two to three turns . I found this figure a bit on the higher side and discussed the same with the doctor who gave me confidence saying this is the best they can do. Looking at the clinic i opted for it and there started my first seating at the end of a 45 minute seating i was told to pay Rs.3700/- which i paid without arguing. Day before i was scheduled for my next appointment so i also took my mom along who had a tooth issue too,I finished my seating and left for work and my mom was also recommended a same treatment which she too opted for. Yesterday i had two appointments one at 11am the other at 12am so my mom opted to take the first slot and when i was about to reach there i got a call saying my appointment is postponed for 1pm in turn i said wont be able to make it then and choose to go today . On date after my seating i was asked to pay Rs.1800/- on which i argued and was told these are additional charges for x-ray etc , in turn i said i was given a package saying this is an all inclusive package excluding the cap, due to Dr. Amit not being present they called him up and he instructed them i had to pay , without creating any nuisance i paid up and said i wont be keen taking my treatment further with them and left. I received a call form Dr. Amit saying he will recheck why was not told about the additional cost and course and assured me a call back from the clinic which i received but to my surprise it was to check whats the call taken for my moms tooth cap , neither i was offered a refund nor got an apology . Found this very unreal and worth putting up so all users and Practo  can be aware that such small things hammer the reputation of a firm and the provider. Have no grudges against anyone in here just a lesson learnt so sharing .\nThe treatment on the whole and the clinic ambience is good , but looking at these issues i chose to continue with some one who can stand and abide by their words and is more transparent in dealing , this i guess is the thumb rule in any service related consumer sovereign market !",

This was a fairly complex issue as this cavity had been there for a while in one of my central incisor. They were very friendly since the start and made sure I was comfortable during the entire process. Dr. Dhruti, Dr. Amit and their entire staff is very hard working and flexible for the patient. They were always available at convenient timings during weekends, considering my hectic travelling schedule during weekdays. The final result of the crown implant is an exact match with my other incisors, which was something I was very skeptical at the beginning, however the result is outstanding! It has also resulted in my teeth being more aligned than what it was before.\n\nPlease do give them a visit in case of any dental issues, they\u2019re one of the very  qualified, friendly and hard working doctors I\u2019ve come across in Mumbai.

Dr Amit has an eye for detail, explained the problem minutely and advised the treatment. Doctor makes you so comfortable with his approach that you tend to feel problem is less.He also advised long term view of taking care of teeth. Overall I would strongly recommend the professionalism and 10 out of 10 rating. Approach to clinic is very easy and it is 100 meters from Dadar station (east)",

Also staff of clinic is very much friendly, sweet and courteous and the follow up is always at its best.

By the time i was 45 i had been suffering numerous dental problems and had about 8 teeth missing from both the upper and lower jaw, luckily for me they were all back teeth and not visible from the front. Over the next 5 or so years these problems continued and led me to having more teeth removed and bridges fitted to both jaws. Over the next 9 years I had root canals completed, more teeth removed and the upper bridge had to be shortened. Then in  February this year the lower bridge broke away   due failing teeth. By this time I had had enough of constant dental work, minimal time between infections, pain etc. Amongst other things i could no longer smile, chew food and felt pretty miserable and embarrassed by it all. Knowing that removable plastic like dentures for the want of a better mame which I wasn't keen on were my only affordable option In Australia i decided to look overseas and find what was available. I then had some scans of my upper and lower jaw taken and sent these to different dental clinics in 3 countries I had chosen from my researching the internet.   From the replies, phone calls, quotes etc and further research I decided that India was were I would be heading. By the time I was ready to go I had been in contact with 10 clinics in India and had narrowed it down to 6, I made appointments with the 6 clinics for the 1st week to feel them out, get quotes and see what they suggested, of the 6 one was discounted at the 1st appointment leaving 5. After follow up appointments another 3 were discounted. I then chose Smile Again for numerous reasons such as professionalism, truthfulness, clinic amenities and general feeling about the staff and Dr Amit. Well after 2 visits over 6 months I have finished my treatment and couldn't be more happier with the results. I would like to thank Dr Amit and the staff for everything and am contactable through the Dr if you want further information from me.",

Together you make a great team and have been extremely caring & compassionate, and have the desire to make your patients happy with the results.\n\nI visited Smile Again - my first visit to a dentist ever - to get my teeth cleaned and get dental braces. A true professional that he is, Dr Amit Chavan patiently made me aware of several of my persistent dental problems, which I had been practically ignoring my entire life. He listened to my concerns and addressed them in a compassionate and professional manner. Later based on the tests and dental x-rays, he recommended Cosmetic Dentistry as an alternative to dental braces.\n\nThis is when Dr Dhruti Raut Chavan stepped in to give me a complete transformation, that too in just 4 sittings. Thank you! I owe you a big one for putting the smile back on my face at the age of 40... true to the name of your clinic 'Smile Again'!\n\nTo top it, Smile Again is very clean and nicely organized. What's also noteworthy is the sunny yellow coloured interiors that exude warmth and instantly cheers you up and the amazing fan at the reception that's symbolic of the mouth mirror - very conceptual and piece of art! also, the whole staff is super friendly and make you feel comfortable during your whole visit.\n\nYou will always be my dentist, and even though I will be living hundreds of miles away, I will come down to Smile Again, for all of my dental needs. \n\nThank you for always smiling and for spreading smiles :)\n\nWarm regards and best wishes always,\nSarita",

Kudos to Dr Lubaina who is a thorough professional at her work, understand the patient\u2019s requirement and treats accordingly. \nDuring the initial consultation with Dr Amit Chavan he took me through the entire process involved in setting my teeth right, and I thought it was great in terms of giving me the much-required confidence.\nOverall a superb experience and my gratitude towards Dr Amit Chavan, Dr Lubaina Tapia and the team of assistants who took care of me and gave a fantastic experience and more importantly removed the fear in me in the first sitting.   \nThank You once again to give back my SMILE \ud83d\ude0a \n",

The thouroness of the work was fantastic and I had minimal/no pain during this period.\nThe the next part of the treatment was to insert.the cement onto the filling and complete the root filling, this was carried out by Dr. Lubaina and she was excellent in doing this phase of the treatment and also explained the work being done and also advices on the nest stage that needed to be done, this was to place a cap on the filling. Unfortunately I was unable to have the cap inserted to to my insufficient time in Mumbai.\nI would like to thank Dr\u2019s Amit, Hitesh, Lubaina and all the wonderful supporting staff.\nI would have no reservation in recommending Dr. Amit and his team for dental care.\n",

I was very pleased the way the appointment went through this app.\nI selected a vicinity close to my residence for the treatment needed, on visiting i was treated in a very professional manner on recommendation to go in for a root canal i opted for it and spoke to Dr. Amit himself who explained me the process in detail . I was given a package of Rs.3500/- plus the cap as per choice and told this would take around two to three turns . I found this figure a bit on the higher side and discussed the same with the doctor who gave me confidence saying this is the best they can do. Looking at the clinic i opted for it and there started my first seating at the end of a 45 minute seating i was told to pay Rs.3700/- which i paid without arguing. Day before i was scheduled for my next appointment so i also took my mom along who had a tooth issue too,I finished my seating and left for work and my mom was also recommended a same treatment which she too opted for. Yesterday i had two appointments one at 11am the other at 12am so my mom opted to take the first slot and when i was about to reach there i got a call saying my appointment is postponed for 1pm in turn i said wont be able to make it then and choose to go today . On date after my seating i was asked to pay Rs.1800/- on which i argued and was told these are additional charges for x-ray etc , in turn i said i was given a package saying this is an all inclusive package excluding the cap, due to Dr. Amit not being present they called him up and he instructed them i had to pay , without creating any nuisance i paid up and said i wont be keen taking my treatment further with them and left. I received a call form Dr. Amit saying he will recheck why was not told about the additional cost and course and assured me a call back from the clinic which i received but to my surprise it was to check whats the call taken for my moms tooth cap , neither i was offered a refund nor got an apology . Found this very unreal and worth putting up so all users and Practo  can be aware that such small things hammer the reputation of a firm and the provider. Have no grudges against anyone in here just a lesson learnt so sharing .\nThe treatment on the whole and the clinic ambience is good , but looking at these issues i chose to continue with some one who can stand and abide by their words and is more transparent in dealing , this i guess is the thumb rule in any service related consumer sovereign market !",

This was a fairly complex issue as this cavity had been there for a while in one of my central incisor. They were very friendly since the start and made sure I was comfortable during the entire process. Dr. Dhruti, Dr. Amit and their entire staff is very hard working and flexible for the patient. They were always available at convenient timings during weekends, considering my hectic travelling schedule during weekdays. The final result of the crown implant is an exact match with my other incisors, which was something I was very skeptical at the beginning, however the result is outstanding! It has also resulted in my teeth being more aligned than what it was before.\n\nPlease do give them a visit in case of any dental issues, they\u2019re one of the very  qualified, friendly and hard working doctors I\u2019ve come across in Mumbai.

They did a very thorough replacement of my old filling before changing the crowns.\n\nThey even accommodated my requests when I had to leave urgently and wanted to prepone my treatment.\nI would have given them a hug and a thanks if not for Corona.\n\nI would highly recommend them at Smile Again Dadar East.\n\nInfact the nurse staff are also wonderful and were extremely welcoming. \n\nA big thanks to everyone.",

Dr Amit has an eye for detail, explained the problem minutely and advised the treatment. Doctor makes you so comfortable with his approach that you tend to feel problem is less.He also advised long term view of taking care of teeth. Overall I would strongly recommend the professionalism and 10 out of 10 rating. Approach to clinic is very easy and it is 100 meters from Dadar station (east)",

Also staff of clinic is very much friendly, sweet and courteous and the follow up is always at its best. I would recommend Dr. Dhruti and Dr. Amit Chavan for dentals issues as both of them are Very proficient and also good by nature.\n\nThanks Smile Again !!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI would visit again for sure!!!",

The surgery was painless, I had local anastesia so I was even abkle to observe what kind of instruments does doctor use. It's already one week - I do nkt have pain, I only had swollen cheek for the first 3 days,but now it's ok.\nIt was absolutely positive experience.",

I underwent smile makeover with laminate veneers of my front 6 teeth and the result is just outstanding. I got back my long last smile thanks to Dr.Amit and Dr. Dhruti.

But, with Dr. Rupashree the anesthesia felt like nothing but a new experience. Not exaggerating, but yeah I used to wait the next sitting. Everything was smoothly done and in minimum sittings. The staff is very understanding and helpful. I\u2019ve visited this place only\u00a0 couple of times and met these people only 5-6 times may be ;but trust me\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\n\r\nIt feels like I\u2019ve known them forever \u2026\u2026.\r\nAmazing experience at Smile Again Dental Clinic.",
