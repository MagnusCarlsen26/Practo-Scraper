,,0,0,YES,"I recently visited Dr. Kavitha for a teeth cleaning and was thoroughly impressed .

Dr. Kavitha herself was professional, gentle, and thorough. She explained each step of the procedure clearly and made sure I was comfortable throughout the appointment. The teeth cleaning itself was painless and efficient, and I left feeling fresh and confident with my clean teeth.

What stood out to me was Dr. Kavitha's attention to detail - she pointed out some areas that needed extra attention and took the time to explain how to improve my oral hygiene at home.
