He had patiently explained the problem in depth and its solution in a way my family members understood. I first went through an orthodontic procedure to correct my teeth positioning which took quite some time. The positioning came right by 2022 when he referred me to Dr Chintamani Kelkar who would be handling my surgery (maxillary osteotomy). The two doctors had great cooperation and kept me engaged in the process descriptions. The post-surgery consultation with Dr. Ravijani and Dr. Kelkar was very helpful with regards to my swelling and post-surgery jaw structure. It\u2019s now been 1 year since the surgery and I feel confident with my facial aesthetic as well as the ability to eat better. Thank you so much Dr. Amar for this cooperation and consistency. ",

After identifying cause he sat with me and my wife and explained problem and its solution. He patiently answered all our queries. \n\nI stay in USA so I am always in time crunch when I visit India. He is very flexible in terms of appointment schedule.

I first went through an orthodontic procedure to correct my teeth positioning which took quite some time. The positioning came right by 2022 when he referred me to Dr Chintamani Kelkar who would be handling my surgery (maxillary osteotomy). The two doctors had great cooperation and kept me engaged in the process descriptions. The post-surgery consultation with Dr. Ravijani and Dr. Kelkar was very helpful with regards to my swelling and post-surgery jaw structure. It\u2019s now been 1 year since the surgery and I feel confident with my facial aesthetic as well as the ability to eat better. Thank you so much Dr. Amar for this cooperation and consistency. ",

After identifying cause he sat with me and my wife and explained problem and its solution. He patiently answered all our queries. \n\nI stay in USA so I am always in time crunch when I visit India. He is very flexible in terms of appointment schedule.

Things like: Pain in my jaw, pain around my ear, difficulty in chewing, pain while chewing, difficulty in opening or closing my mouth, click sound while opening or closing my mouth and frequent headache, were common for me. Then an aunt of mine who's a dentist recommended Dr. Amar Ravjiani for my treatment. The way he understood my problems and explained me what I was going through, cleared my doubts on trusting somebody who would completely cure me of such a rare and unknown disorder. My treatment is currently ongoing, but have experienced a lot of difference in my jaw and its movement. Being a foodie, I can now chew my favourite delicacies without a thought. ;) \nFor now, waiting to have it cured completely and live life pain free.\nThank you soooo much Dr. Amar :) ",

During the course of the treatment there was a time when my teeth were not tracking, he worked with me to get new set of braces from Invisalign increasing the numbers of braces, to suit my requirement.\n\nI am really very happy with the outcome. Amar in my opinion is a great professional and I would highly recommend him.",

I felt almost instant pain relief after wearing the splint. The doctor made adjustments on my splint each month, and he was very attentive and thorough during this process, making sure it was adjusted perfectly. He is very confident of his method\u2019s ability to help his patients. I am very satisfied with the results. I also appreciate that the doctor took the time to explain in detail what the issue was and what steps we need to take to fix it.  It gave me some confidence moving forward about a situation I was confused about for so long. The doctor is very patient, thorough, and experienced.",

I can never imagine any other Doctor supporting a patient so much. Dr. Amar Ravjiani is an amazing human being and an absolute magician.

This is not so common in Mumbai and it was such a relief to find the expertise of Dr Ravjiani.\nOur daughter had pain when chewing and couldn\u2019t actually open her mouth fully. She also suffered from frequent headaches. Dr Ravjiani was very detailed and patient in explaining the splint treatment. Over time we could see very clear improvement. Her headaches and pain disappeared and she can now bite in an apple. The treatment was really efficient. We strongly recommend Dr Ravjiani for his professionalism and kindness. We appreciated that he never pushed to do unnecessary treatment. His clinic is extremely clean and we always felt re-assured by his competency\n",

He immediately suggested a CT scan, which corroborated his diagnosis of the TMJ issue, following which he made a detailed PowerPoint deck to present the issue with pictures and videos of my biting and side face. He then ordered a splint to be made urgently since I was leaving to go back to the US in a couple of days, which provided instant relief for the pain. Now, we are moving to the therapeutic part of it, correcting my bite. We will be getting a digital scan for Invisalign. Truly very happy with the help and have seen TMJ specialists in chicago, still come back to Dr. Ravijiani. ",
