After my late thirties, a huge gap developed between my central incisors and somehow it started impacting my public speaking activities as my lips could not cover the protruding upper incisor teeth.  \n\nFortunately, I met Dr. Soham Mallick to whom I showed my 25 years old picture and asked, \u201cCan my teeth become beautiful again like my teeth in this picture ?\u201d. Dr. Soham\u2019s emphatic and straight reply was \u201cYes\u201d and it eliminated all my doubts and made me determined to get my Orthodontics treatment with him.\n\nGetting my teeth re-aligned was certainly an arduous task to which Dr. Soham dealt very scientifically applying his previous experience understanding my teeth anatomy. One of his biggest feat is to complete my treatment without surgical interventions, which I initially presumed to be inevitable. Kudos to Dr. Soham\u2019s diligent and perseverance endeavor to make my teeth back as it was when I was in 20s. \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Soham to all as he possess deep Orthodontics acumen and integrity who circumvent patient\u2019s irrational medical expense making the treatment cost effective too.",

After my late thirties, a huge gap developed between my central incisors and somehow it started impacting my public speaking activities as my lips could not cover the protruding upper incisor teeth.  \n\nFortunately, I met Dr. Soham Mallick to whom I showed my 25 years old picture and asked, \u201cCan my teeth become beautiful again like my teeth in this picture ?\u201d. Dr. Soham\u2019s emphatic and straight reply was \u201cYes\u201d and it eliminated all my doubts and made me determined to get my Orthodontics treatment with him.\n\nGetting my teeth re-aligned was certainly an arduous task to which Dr. Soham dealt very scientifically applying his previous experience understanding my teeth anatomy. One of his biggest feat is to complete my treatment without surgical interventions, which I initially presumed to be inevitable. Kudos to Dr. Soham\u2019s diligent and perseverance endeavor to make my teeth back as it was when I was in 20s. \n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Soham to all as he possess deep Orthodontics acumen and integrity who circumvent patient\u2019s irrational medical expense making the treatment cost effective too.",
