"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Fillings,Painful Teething,",0,0,YES,"A month ago, I got my tooth fillings done in Delhi. I was not comfortable with the treatment, I felt sensitivity even after a couple of weeks, it then started paining and then lead to severely throbbing pain.

I had to travel to Mumbai for my exams and I was completely on painkillers  

I was in a lot of pain and that too in a city where I had no one. She indeed were a blessing to me. 

I found her clinic on practo and visited her, She analysed the whole situation and made me comfortable throughout the whole process.

While i was hopping clinics, Everyone suggested me to go for a immediate root canal, She on the other saw a possibility that the pain can be reduced even without root canal, She educated me with how and why the pain was occurring.     

I am off painkillers the day I came from the clinic.

My pain is gone! I can finally eat now, I cannot describe in words how blessed i am to have entered your clinic.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Ceramic Crowns and Bridges Fixing,",0,0,YES,"The ceramic crown which was refixed on 01.05.2022 at Delhi came out on 31.05.2022. Since I am new to city I approached her by searching net. After examining the cap she explained me the pros and cons of refixing same cap vis-a-vis putting a pors fiber and building up and fixing a new cap. Based on the advice we went for permanent solution to strengthen teeth. During procedure due to some complications the procedure has to be modified and she explained the reasons to undertake modified procedure. After taking all precautions finally the tooth has been restored functionally. This tooth has decayed abruptly and while doing RCT in May 2020 in Gurgaon I new that there is bone loss and it will be very difficult to restore it. 
But same could be achieved due to her experience, meticulous planning .
