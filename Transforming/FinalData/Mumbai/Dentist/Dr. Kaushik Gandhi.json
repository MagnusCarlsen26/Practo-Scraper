The pain was so much that I was taking pain killers everyday and my day to day routines were impacted. I kept pushing the treatment because I thought ' If the cavity itself is causing so much pain, the treatment of the same ( Root Canal Treatment) would be a nightmare'.\n\nHowever when the pain started getting out of hand, I came across Dr Kaushik on Practo. I believe I am very lucky that this happened.\n\nI spoke with Dr Kaushik for 10 minutes over the call and that was enough for me to book a consultation. He reassured me that I will not feel any pain whatsoever and the entire treatment will be hassle free. And all of that was 100% true. \n\nAcross my 3 sittings which included Consultation, Dental Cleaning, Root Canal, Temporary Cap & permanent cap fitting, these were the highlights:\n\n* No waiting time: I did not have to wait for even 5 minutes before Dr Kaushik began his treatment \n\n* Hygiene: Dr Kaushik's entire team was clad in PPE suits and utmost importance was given to hygiene \n\n* Behaviour & Attitude: Dr Kaushik patiently explained the medical nuisances of the treatment and constantly updated me about the next steps. His nature & attitude was very comforting. \n\n* Quality of Equipment/ Products: All the products and equipment that was used during the treatment was of the highest possible standards- right from the temporary cap to the cements used to the numbing gels.\n\n* No Pain: I will not be exaggerating when I say there was 'zero' pain throughout the treatment. After getting to know Dr Kaushik, I realized that he has spent years studying &Pain and methods to alleviate Discomfort'. \n\n* End Result: I now have a clean pair of teeth owing the deep cleaning done by Dr Kaushik. The persistent pain has gone. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. \n\nI have now made it a point to visit Dr Kaushik on a regular basis because I have complete faith in him today. \n\nTo anyone who is confused about where to go for dental problems, I will insist you spend only 5 minutes talking to him- I am sure you will not look anywhere else for dental treatments.\n\nTo conclude I want to mention one instance:\n\nI often asked the doctor after various phases of the treatment - ' Is the procedure really done?'. This is because I could not believe how I could not feel even a pinch.",

Dr. Kaushik Gandhi, once you see him at work, will not go to anyone else for any of your dental problems. He is not the one to recommend a root canal when one can save the tooth. He will give you the correct advise. He will give you ample time and will not hurry things up. The best way to assess a dentist is the way your teeth feel after the cleaning or extraction. After my tooth extraction and cleaning, I did not experience any sensitivity or any pain. I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for a trustworthy dentist. If you go to him, you teeth are in the right hands.  Staff of Dr. Gandhi is well trained and cordial. I found the clinic and the equipment used to be extremely clean and hygienic.",

His treatment was way advanced for the time then, and nothing has changed now! He keeps abreast with the research and upgrading his knowledge in the field of DENTAL CARE  and brings it to his patients with cutting edge technologies. \n\nI booked my appointment without a blink as for 25 years  I never had to revisit him or anyone else for the fillings in these years as the job was done perfectly!  This time too the experience was noting short of magical. A painless root canal! I was dreading it as i had heard stories about bitter experiences from friends on how painful it could be. \n\nThe best thing is there's no waiting time whatsoever as that's a policy he wouches by. He is highly experienced and skilled with a an awesome team of two assistants and his lovely wife who looked over my two kids which I was getting treated. The clinic is immaculately maintained, and he uses premium products.\n\n He explained the whole process with pros and cons to help me take an informed decision on which type of tooth cap I should choose. \n\nBeing a perfectionist at his job, he will do whatever it takes to ensure you get the best! My tooth being small was difficult to scan for an x- ray, but he wouldn't stop retaking x rays until he was convinced.  Moreover he measured my tooth digitally for precession. It was so quick and smooth \n Also he completed the procedure in just three sittings.\n\nI highly recommend him for all your dental care needs. Thank you doctor for this wonderful experience.\n\nPooja Pai ",

And I can only thank my stars for this!\n\nThere was a collective mess in most of my teeth and each tooth required a lot of work and had multiple complications. Dr Gandhi's approach is clinical, focused and very very patient friendly. He uses sophisticated and advanced equipments and very high quality consumables. He planned my treatment in advance and explained everything in detail. Each and every single one of my appointments were smooth, absolutely pain free and pleasant. There was no wait time. \n\nSpecial mention to Parul ma'am and Mahesh and Anant with Dr Gandhi. Collectively, I actually looked forward to come for my dental appointments! They all became friends!\n\nIt's liberating to eat and chew normally - something that I had forgotten in the last few years! Huge Thanks to Doc for bringing normalcy back to my life!!\n\nThank you Sir!",

His confidence is admirable and inspires the same in us patients. I can be a difficult patient but Dr Gandhi patiently went through my many questions and made sure I was always assured and satisfied. Dr Gandhi is a very skilled doctor with many years of experiance and expertise. I can confidently say that I am happy with the treatment and my new set of teeth and lovely smile. I will recommend Dr Kaushikbhai to all my near and dear ones as the dentist of choice in Mumbai.",

                "review_text": "It will be difficult to articulate how grateful I am to Dr. Kaushik Gandhi, but I will attempt to convey all the reasons why anyone can blindly trust his professional services. \n\nI had been suffering from persistent pain/ sensitivity due to formation of a cavity in one of my molars. The pain was so much that I was taking pain killers everyday and my day to day routines were impacted. I kept pushing the treatment because I thought ' If the cavity itself is causing so much pain, the treatment of the same ( Root Canal Treatment) would be a nightmare'.\n\nHowever when the pain started getting out of hand, I came across Dr Kaushik on Practo. I believe I am very lucky that this happened.\n\nI spoke with Dr Kaushik for 10 minutes over the call and that was enough for me to book a consultation. He reassured me that I will not feel any pain whatsoever and the entire treatment will be hassle free. And all of that was 100% true. \n\nAcross my 3 sittings which included Consultation, Dental Cleaning, Root Canal, Temporary Cap & permanent cap fitting, these were the highlights:\n\n* No waiting time: I did not have to wait for even 5 minutes before Dr Kaushik began his treatment \n\n* Hygiene: Dr Kaushik's entire team was clad in PPE suits and utmost importance was given to hygiene \n\n* Behaviour & Attitude: Dr Kaushik patiently explained the medical nuisances of the treatment and constantly updated me about the next steps. His nature & attitude was very comforting. \n\n* Quality of Equipment/ Products: All the products and equipment that was used during the treatment was of the highest possible standards- right from the temporary cap to the cements used to the numbing gels.\n\n* No Pain: I will not be exaggerating when I say there was 'zero' pain throughout the treatment. After getting to know Dr Kaushik, I realized that he has spent years studying &Pain and methods to alleviate Discomfort'. \n\n* End Result: I now have a clean pair of teeth owing the deep cleaning done by Dr Kaushik. The persistent pain has gone. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. \n\nI have now made it a point to visit Dr Kaushik on a regular basis because I have complete faith in him today. \n\nTo anyone who is confused about where to go for dental problems, I will insist you spend only 5 minutes talking to him- I am sure you will not look anywhere else for dental treatments.\n\nTo conclude I want to mention one instance:\n\nI often asked the doctor after various phases of the treatment - ' Is the procedure really done?'. This is because I could not believe how I could not feel even a pinch.",

Dr. Kaushik Gandhi, once you see him at work, will not go to anyone else for any of your dental problems. He is not the one to recommend a root canal when one can save the tooth. He will give you the correct advise. He will give you ample time and will not hurry things up. The best way to assess a dentist is the way your teeth feel after the cleaning or extraction. After my tooth extraction and cleaning, I did not experience any sensitivity or any pain. I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for a trustworthy dentist. If you go to him, you teeth are in the right hands.  Staff of Dr. Gandhi is well trained and cordial. I found the clinic and the equipment used to be extremely clean and hygienic.",

His treatment was way advanced for the time then, and nothing has changed now! He keeps abreast with the research and upgrading his knowledge in the field of DENTAL CARE  and brings it to his patients with cutting edge technologies. \n\nI booked my appointment without a blink as for 25 years  I never had to revisit him or anyone else for the fillings in these years as the job was done perfectly!  This time too the experience was noting short of magical. A painless root canal! I was dreading it as i had heard stories about bitter experiences from friends on how painful it could be. \n\nThe best thing is there's no waiting time whatsoever as that's a policy he wouches by. He is highly experienced and skilled with a an awesome team of two assistants and his lovely wife who looked over my two kids which I was getting treated. The clinic is immaculately maintained, and he uses premium products.\n\n He explained the whole process with pros and cons to help me take an informed decision on which type of tooth cap I should choose. \n\nBeing a perfectionist at his job, he will do whatever it takes to ensure you get the best! My tooth being small was difficult to scan for an x- ray, but he wouldn't stop retaking x rays until he was convinced.  Moreover he measured my tooth digitally for precession. It was so quick and smooth \n Also he completed the procedure in just three sittings.\n\nI highly recommend him for all your dental care needs. Thank you doctor for this wonderful experience.\n\nPooja Pai ",

And I can only thank my stars for this!\n\nThere was a collective mess in most of my teeth and each tooth required a lot of work and had multiple complications. Dr Gandhi's approach is clinical, focused and very very patient friendly. He uses sophisticated and advanced equipments and very high quality consumables. He planned my treatment in advance and explained everything in detail. Each and every single one of my appointments were smooth, absolutely pain free and pleasant. There was no wait time. \n\nSpecial mention to Parul ma'am and Mahesh and Anant with Dr Gandhi. Collectively, I actually looked forward to come for my dental appointments! They all became friends!\n\nIt's liberating to eat and chew normally - something that I had forgotten in the last few years! Huge Thanks to Doc for bringing normalcy back to my life!!\n\nThank you Sir!",

I must say I was very happy with Dr. Gandhi\u2019s diagnosis of the problems and his clear understanding and action plan to resolve all my issues in a set time frame.  His confidence is admirable and inspires the same in us patients. I can be a difficult patient but Dr Gandhi patiently went through my many questions and made sure I was always assured and satisfied. Dr Gandhi is a very skilled doctor with many years of experiance and expertise. I can confidently say that I am happy with the treatment and my new set of teeth and lovely smile. I will recommend Dr Kaushikbhai to all my near and dear ones as the dentist of choice in Mumbai.",
