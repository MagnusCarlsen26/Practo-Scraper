I don\u2019t know many people in the city to ask for doctor recommendations so I \u201cGoogled\u201d urgent care practices in the city. Immediately I phoned Dental Clinic and spoke with Dr Harsh. Dr Harsh was kind, considerate and automatically made me feel better. I walked in yesterday, without an appointment, after my medical issue continued to get worse and was treated as if I\u2019d been a patient of Dr. Harsh\u2019s for years. Dr. Harsh was amazing. My procedure lasted for 30 minutes . In 30 minutes I had a full exam, blood drawn for lab work and Dr. Harsh explained every thought he had concerning my issue. I will absolutely go back to Dr Harsh Dental CLinic. My entire experience from my first phone call to the moment I walked out the door was beyond positive. I am grateful to have found Dr. Harsh. I will highly recommend him to everyone.\r\n",

Dr. Harsh has taken all the measurements of my tooth to save it. He has cleaned all of my canals and completed it explaining each possible step that he is performing so that I remain informed. Sir is well aware of what are my pain points in and around the tooth, so while treating he informs me before hand. \nDoing Re-RCT took me 2 sessions (according to my convenience) due to my tooth complexity and it involved multiple X-rays. I get a reminder of my appointments so that I don't miss out the procedure. I would recommend doctors like Dr. Harsh to all of my friends and relatives just because of his communication and experience. These two things makes him stand out.\nAlso, behind operating my tooth, it's the entire team with the doctor I'd thank. ",

The doctor Suggested RCT and an amount of 5800 for the RCT treatment was told to us...After finishing the RCT they said some other doctor will do the filling and we choose not to go for any dental cap and asked them to fill the cavity for which they charged 1800 separately. This practice is not there anywhere else....The RCT cost always includes the filling cost...***** **** **** ***** *** ** ***** ***** *** *** ***** ** ******* ***** **** ****r....Clarity of cost of treatment is a big miss there....Not recommended for someone who is visitiNg a dentist for the first time....Because u will never be told about the clarity and steps of treatments and cost thereon...",

Else other dentists call you at a particular time and have you wait for an hour before treating you. \nThe cons were injections during the RC which I hated in my mouth but the doctor was kind enough to joke around it and lightened the mood. \nI also realised that once a year dental check up is a must since there were cavities which would have gone unnoticed and would turn into an RC. All cavities were detected and treated proactively. ",

I don\u2019t know many people in the city to ask for doctor recommendations so I \u201cGoogled\u201d urgent care practices in the city. Immediately I phoned Dental Clinic and spoke with Dr Harsh. Dr Harsh was kind, considerate and automatically made me feel better. I walked in yesterday, without an appointment, after my medical issue continued to get worse and was treated as if I\u2019d been a patient of Dr. Harsh\u2019s for years. Dr. Harsh was amazing. My procedure lasted for 30 minutes . In 30 minutes I had a full exam, blood drawn for lab work and Dr. Harsh explained every thought he had concerning my issue. I will absolutely go back to Dr Harsh Dental CLinic. My entire experience from my first phone call to the moment I walked out the door was beyond positive. I am grateful to have found Dr. Harsh. I will highly recommend him to everyone.\r\n",

Dr. Harsh has done my Re-RCT because I had a bad decay after an old RCT. It was so bad that other doctors would have removed my tooth and it wouldn't cost much. Dr. Harsh has taken all the measurements of my tooth to save it. He has cleaned all of my canals and completed it explaining each possible step that he is performing so that I remain informed. Sir is well aware of what are my pain points in and around the tooth, so while treating he informs me before hand. \nDoing Re-RCT took me 2 sessions (according to my convenience) due to my tooth complexity and it involved multiple X-rays. I get a reminder of my appointments so that I don't miss out the procedure. I would recommend doctors like Dr. Harsh to all of my friends and relatives just because of his communication and experience. These two things makes him stand out.\nAlso, behind operating my tooth, it's the entire team with the doctor I'd thank. ",

She did cleaning of my teeth very well and informed me to take care of it and precautions I need to follow in future to keep my teeth in good and healthy conditions.\nThey both make sure that their patient is aware of what treatment they have been given and what imapct its going to have which builds trust in patient and he feels that he is in safe hand.\nMy entire root canal treatment was very smooth.\nLast but not least their staff is very good and friendly too.\nI would say Crown and Root Canal clinics Doctor and their staff compliment each other very well which is very important.",

There are many option\u2019s available for teeth aesthetics. \nWhat I liked about the appointments were that I did not have to wait for my turn. Else other dentists call you at a particular time and have you wait for an hour before treating you. \nThe cons were injections during the RC which I hated in my mouth but the doctor was kind enough to joke around it and lightened the mood. \nI also realised that once a year dental check up is a must since there were cavities which would have gone unnoticed and would turn into an RC. All cavities were detected and treated proactively. ",
