,,0,0,YES,Had problems with the dental bridges. Consulted different doctors. But I was satisfied with doctor Abdul Haque Inamdar's explanation and confidence in treatment. I am very much satisfied and thankful that I landed in the hands of a very good professional doctor. The treatment and implantation of the teeth was not very painful due to his expertise. Waiting period is very short at the time of appointment. I would highly recommend him for the dental treatment and implantation of the teeth.,2024-08-02 10:50:01,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
