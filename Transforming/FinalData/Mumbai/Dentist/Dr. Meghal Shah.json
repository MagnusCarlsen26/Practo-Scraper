That is when my Friend Leena who herself is jis patient since 10 years recommended me Dr Meghal . \nWe did a consultation followed by scans and everything was explained in detail.  We did 6 implants in upper jaw and  6 implants in lower jaw. And i can assure you it was all seamless experience. With very little discomfort\n The best thing about him. Is he is very approachable. \nI am very satisfies with his work and would highly recommend him for anyone who wants to get implants done from him.  He truly restores smiles amd chewing with a personal touch ",
