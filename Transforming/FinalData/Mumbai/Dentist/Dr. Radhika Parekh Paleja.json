My treatment involved initial examination with Dr. Radhika,  CBCT at a nearby Facility and treatment planning followed by surgery and placing of four dental implants, two sets per day. The doctor explained the whole process to me before the treatment started. I found Dr. Radhika to be highly professional and meticulous in her clinical work. She has very polite and pleasing mannerism which gave me full confidence that I was in safe hands. Her clinic was very neat and clean which is a part of NM Medicals in Bandra West. The actual treatment sessions of surgeries and placing of implants were virtually painless and the whole experience was highly satisfying. I shall be happily and confidently recommending her name to all my friends, associates and relatives who need dental treatments involving implants and other prosthesis like, crown, bridge, dentures (partial or complete & removable or partial).

After looking at the scan she explained very thoroughly the procedure of extraction of the wisdom tooth as it was growing at an angle causing infection and cavity. I was very scared and worried and she allied my fears and was very warm and understanding. She is a thorough professional who did an excellent job and the extraction was done in no time. Throughout the procedure, Dr. Radhika was talking to me and calming me down. During the extraction, she was telling me what was happening at each moment. She even showed me the tooth removed. Her nurse is also very sweet and held my hand when the anesthesia was injected. Dr Radhika had promised a pain free experience and that is exactly what had happened. There was no swelling and the healing was very fast. Thank you so much for such an amazing experience for a person who got something done on her teeth for the first time.",

My treatment involved initial examination with Dr. Radhika,  CBCT at a nearby Facility and treatment planning followed by surgery and placing of four dental implants, two sets per day. The doctor explained the whole process to me before the treatment started. I found Dr. Radhika to be highly professional and meticulous in her clinical work. She has very polite and pleasing mannerism which gave me full confidence that I was in safe hands. Her clinic was very neat and clean which is a part of NM Medicals in Bandra West. The actual treatment sessions of surgeries and placing of implants were virtually painless and the whole experience was highly satisfying. I shall be happily and confidently recommending her name to all my friends, associates and relatives who need dental treatments involving implants and other prosthesis like, crown, bridge, dentures (partial or complete & removable or partial).

After looking at the scan she explained very thoroughly the procedure of extraction of the wisdom tooth as it was growing at an angle causing infection and cavity. I was very scared and worried and she allied my fears and was very warm and understanding. She is a thorough professional who did an excellent job and the extraction was done in no time. Throughout the procedure, Dr. Radhika was talking to me and calming me down. During the extraction, she was telling me what was happening at each moment. She even showed me the tooth removed. Her nurse is also very sweet and held my hand when the anesthesia was injected. Dr Radhika had promised a pain free experience and that is exactly what had happened. There was no swelling and the healing was very fast. Thank you so much for such an amazing experience for a person who got something done on her teeth for the first time.",
