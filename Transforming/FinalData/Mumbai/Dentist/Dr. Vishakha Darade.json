I also went for Zirconia crown after the Root Canal Treatment and I am able to easily eat ,crunch, grind without any discomfort whatsoever.\nI would surely recommend Dr.Vishakha because never did she influence me for any treatment and I went for the treatments wherever I was facing issues with. But she did explain me in detail on all my problem tooth.\nThe charges are also quite reasonable and the clinic is as it should be very neat clean and bright with all equipment's in place. \nA truly friendly and soft spoken polite Dentist Doctor whom I wish the very best of professional success and personal well being always.\nA word a thanks and appreciation to Dr. Disha Mehta associate dentist to Dr.Vishakha who was also excellent in her knowledge , information on the problems and the partial treatment performed.\nPlease keep up the good work Dr.Vishakha.\nBest Wishes.",

I recently got comprehensive dental treatment done at Dr Vishakhas dental clinic which included root canals, 2 crowns and cleaning and polishing.The whole ordeal was so smooth. The root canal was absolutely painless. Lasted Just 45 mins in the dental chair and I was up and walking. Pain free and happy! I neglected most of my dental problems and delayed it as I was scared of dentists but I can happily say I'm not scared anymore. If you too are lookin for dental treatment and are scared of dentist dr vishakhas dental clinic is the place for you! Shes a through professional calm and a true perfectionist. She explained me the entire procedure and only went ahead once I was convinced. The hygiene in the clinic is also top notch, something that made me comfortable to go and get treatment done especially during this pandemic. The staff is very courteous too. Thank you. 5 stars to you. Keep up the good work.",

I also went for Zirconia crown after the Root Canal Treatment and I am able to easily eat ,crunch, grind without any discomfort whatsoever.\nI would surely recommend Dr.Vishakha because never did she influence me for any treatment and I went for the treatments wherever I was facing issues with. But she did explain me in detail on all my problem tooth.\nThe charges are also quite reasonable and the clinic is as it should be very neat clean and bright with all equipment's in place. \nA truly friendly and soft spoken polite Dentist Doctor whom I wish the very best of professional success and personal well being always.\nA word a thanks and appreciation to Dr. Disha Mehta associate dentist to Dr.Vishakha who was also excellent in her knowledge , information on the problems and the partial treatment performed.\nPlease keep up the good work Dr.Vishakha.\nBest Wishes.",

I recently got comprehensive dental treatment done at Dr Vishakhas dental clinic which included root canals, 2 crowns and cleaning and polishing.The whole ordeal was so smooth. The root canal was absolutely painless. Lasted Just 45 mins in the dental chair and I was up and walking. Pain free and happy! I neglected most of my dental problems and delayed it as I was scared of dentists but I can happily say I'm not scared anymore. If you too are lookin for dental treatment and are scared of dentist dr vishakhas dental clinic is the place for you! Shes a through professional calm and a true perfectionist. She explained me the entire procedure and only went ahead once I was convinced. The hygiene in the clinic is also top notch, something that made me comfortable to go and get treatment done especially during this pandemic. The staff is very courteous too. Thank you. 5 stars to you. Keep up the good work.",
