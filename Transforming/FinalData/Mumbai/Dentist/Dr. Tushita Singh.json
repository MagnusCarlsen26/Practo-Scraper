She is such a cool as well as a disciplined person who take care of her patient with friendly gestures AND strictly warn them when they did something wrong or harmful to themselves during the treatment. For instance, I am a dancer and I have broken atleast 4-5 ceramic braces of my set till now because of different reasons every time. Accordingly she should have scolded me.. But she acted very calmy which I really didn't expected at any way. And latest, when I visited her with an unknowingly broken brace... She laughed and asked me that where you had fallen? ... Your two braces have broken. I was shocked.. Because I didn't felt their breaking..and then she told me to chill... As it is ok to happen with patients and I got relief! Such incidents are quite so little but means a lot for a doctor and her patient bond because these little things effect the treatment too i.e the most important part between them. One more thing, before my treatment got started, I was really very scared for having braces kind of thing... But she explained me the whole procedure so well that I got convinced to have them. I also visited 2-3 dentists before visiting her..,they infact didn't explained me in such a way that Dr. Tushita did to me. So, that's why I decided to hand over the responsibility of my smile to her. I have my teeth problems since childhood.. I am that kid who has visited dentist in every 2-3 months .. So for me.. I have had experiences with many dentists *** * *** *** **** *** ******* ***** ** *** **** ***** *** ** **** ******* I don't have to visit any other dentist after her and her fantastic treatment! ",

I opted for the Invisalign route for my treatment and the results achieved within just 6 months are phenomenal.\n\nThey were quick to respond to my queries and guided me through the nitty gritties of my treatment with the help of accurate simulations.\n\nTimings of my appointments were made very flexible which was especially important for me as my work kept me mostly out of station. They also kept monitoring my progress on phone and always reminded me of my upcoming sittings even if I forgot.(even after I had paid the treatment fees, which was also very nominal).\n\nIn addition to the above, seeing smiling warm faces who patiently hear out all your trivial queries is a departure from the stereotypical grumpy old impatient dentists with bad handwriting you may sometimes come across.\n\n\n",

She seems to be a very moral and ideal professional and I've heard my daughters mentioning her to their friends for treatment as well. We in dwarka sector 18 are very happy with her and suggest her to anyone looking for the best dentist in dwarka. We could say with confidence she's the most popular orthodontist in Delhi for sure.

She takes into account her patient\u2019s needs and wants in every decision and plans much ahead.\n\nI also had the pleasure of having a chipped tooth rebuilt by Dr. Mahima and couldn\u2019t believe the perfection of the end result.\n\nBottomline - you only get flawless execution and advise from Dr. Tushita and Dr. Mahima. Highly recommended for all sorts of dental procedures.",

I was worried about the cost factor, the doctor gave me all options from lowest to highest, gave me a lot of brochures and pamphlets and told me to read as much as possible before making a decision. After I visited few websites, I saw her as a Gold Invisalign provider in Dwarka mentioned on all Invisalign websites and other brands too, it made me very confident and I decided to start my treatment with her. I had financial restrictions so I could not pay big amounts, she broke it down into easy EMI payment options for Invisalign treatment. I\u2019m not midway through my treatment, seeing gap closure of teeth and even chewing has improved. I recommend Dr Tushita Singh for anyone seeking the best Orthodontist in Dwarka for braces or Invisalign treatment, I am completely satisfied with my experience.",

She is such a cool as well as a disciplined person who take care of her patient with friendly gestures AND strictly warn them when they did something wrong or harmful to themselves during the treatment. For instance, I am a dancer and I have broken atleast 4-5 ceramic braces of my set till now because of different reasons every time. Accordingly she should have scolded me.. But she acted very calmy which I really didn't expected at any way. And latest, when I visited her with an unknowingly broken brace... She laughed and asked me that where you had fallen? ... Your two braces have broken. I was shocked.. Because I didn't felt their breaking..and then she told me to chill... As it is ok to happen with patients and I got relief! Such incidents are quite so little but means a lot for a doctor and her patient bond because these little things effect the treatment too i.e the most important part between them. One more thing, before my treatment got started, I was really very scared for having braces kind of thing... But she explained me the whole procedure so well that I got convinced to have them. I also visited 2-3 dentists before visiting her..,they infact didn't explained me in such a way that Dr. Tushita did to me. So, that's why I decided to hand over the responsibility of my smile to her. I have my teeth problems since childhood.. I am that kid who has visited dentist in every 2-3 months .. So for me.. I have had experiences with many dentists *** * *** *** **** *** ******* ***** ** *** **** ***** *** ** **** ******* I don't have to visit any other dentist after her and her fantastic treatment! ",

I opted for the Invisalign route for my treatment and the results achieved within just 6 months are phenomenal.\n\nThey were quick to respond to my queries and guided me through the nitty gritties of my treatment with the help of accurate simulations.\n\nTimings of my appointments were made very flexible which was especially important for me as my work kept me mostly out of station. They also kept monitoring my progress on phone and always reminded me of my upcoming sittings even if I forgot.(even after I had paid the treatment fees, which was also very nominal).\n\nIn addition to the above, seeing smiling warm faces who patiently hear out all your trivial queries is a departure from the stereotypical grumpy old impatient dentists with bad handwriting you may sometimes come across.\n\n\n",

She seems to be a very moral and ideal professional and I've heard my daughters mentioning her to their friends for treatment as well. We in dwarka sector 18 are very happy with her and suggest her to anyone looking for the best dentist in dwarka. We could say with confidence she's the most popular orthodontist in Delhi for sure.

I was worried about the cost factor, the doctor gave me all options from lowest to highest, gave me a lot of brochures and pamphlets and told me to read as much as possible before making a decision. After I visited few websites, I saw her as a Gold Invisalign provider in Dwarka mentioned on all Invisalign websites and other brands too, it made me very confident and I decided to start my treatment with her. I had financial restrictions so I could not pay big amounts, she broke it down into easy EMI payment options for Invisalign treatment. I\u2019m not midway through my treatment, seeing gap closure of teeth and even chewing has improved. I recommend Dr Tushita Singh for anyone seeking the best Orthodontist in Dwarka for braces or Invisalign treatment, I am completely satisfied with my experience.",

Dr Tushita suggested Invisalign and fixed my teeth gaps first,i was surprised at how nicely they were aligned with just a few weeks of treatment. After that she did teeth whitening and gave me veneers for my front 2 broken teeth. I feel like a new person when i look in the mirror,my photos came out amazing and everyone complimented me and my bride equally. I really wish to thank Dr Tushita for her time, treatment planning and this outcome.

She understood it's an expensive treatment and told us to go home and read about it and think about it, we liked that she did not push us. Both of us have started our Invisalign treatment with Dr Tushita and we are extremely happy with our decision. We recommend her to anyone looking for this treatment in dwarka Or entire Delhi.

Dr Mahina is making his denture by replacing his missing teeth at a surprisingly affordable cost. Now Dr Tushita is starting metal braces treatment of my elder daughter all here in Dwarka. Both of them have filled the void of a good and dependable dental clinic in Dwarka and saved us the trouble of travelling to South Delhi",

But once we met her she presented such a clear picture of the procedure including duration of the treatment that we started the treatment of metallic self ligating braces. We were satisfied with the treatment as the doctor has great knowledge and is very professional. She is very cooperative with the patients and values their time. She provides the EMI option also if the treatment is costly and lengthy. I would recommend you this clinic if you are looking for a good orthodontist.",
