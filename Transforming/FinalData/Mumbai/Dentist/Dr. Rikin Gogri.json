The  clinic was impressive and  displayed certificates of Dr. Rikin Gogri, inside he had 'state of art' latest equipment in-house, and a 3d xray scan was done on the spot and Dr Gogri explained the implant process and he bagan the procedure, he had to remove a piece of tooth lodged inside my upper jaw and I thought it would be painful, but it wasn't and everything went smooth, implant was put immediately in the jaw. Next appointment was after 3 months because the bone and the implant needed to be fused together, then the tooth design was made, in 5 days flat the new tooth was fitted and now after being satisfied that I was right in selecting him. I am writing this review. I would highly recommend Dr Rikin Gogri and Aurous Dental in Goregaon west.",

The  clinic was impressive and  displayed certificates of Dr. Rikin Gogri, inside he had 'state of art' latest equipment in-house, and a 3d xray scan was done on the spot and Dr Gogri explained the implant process and he bagan the procedure, he had to remove a piece of tooth lodged inside my upper jaw and I thought it would be painful, but it wasn't and everything went smooth, implant was put immediately in the jaw. Next appointment was after 3 months because the bone and the implant needed to be fused together, then the tooth design was made, in 5 days flat the new tooth was fitted and now after being satisfied that I was right in selecting him. I am writing this review. I would highly recommend Dr Rikin Gogri and Aurous Dental in Goregaon west.",

Dr Rikin suggested to go for a single sitting root canal and we agreed for the same. The root canal specialist doctor was very gentle and she completed my mothers root canal in about one and half hour and same day measurements for cap was taken. The cap was fitted after one week. The whole treatment was painless and we had a very good experience so i would certainly recommend aurous dental as the best dentist in goregaon west.

As soon as I entered clinic, we were happy to see that clinic is so tidy and comforting. Adequate precautions were taken and Dr's and staff were in protective  gear and we saw that they were sanitising the clinic after every patient. My extraction was done same day by the surgeon available in the clinic. It was pain free and comfortable. I would highly recommend Aurous Dental and Dr Rikin Gogri",

I agreed and we started the treatment. Measurement was taken and he gave me temporary caps the next day and after a week the permanent ones were fit. It looked amazing and I couldn't believe my front teeth could look so perfect. I am very happy and satisfied and grateful to Dr Rikin and his team at his dental clinic for correcting my smile.",

Last month My neighbour referred me to Dr Rikin Gogri at AUROUS dental in goregaon West.\nHe examined and took a full mouth xray and suggested to go for the laser surgery for gums. We agreed to do it and the surgery was done next day. It was absolutely pain free, no stitches and no swelling or discomfort. It has been over a month now and my mother is absolutely fine and comfortable. Laser surgery done by Dr Rikin worked very well for my mother. The clinic is nice, neat and very clean. Decor is also very nice. I would highly recommend Dr Rikin Gogri.",

I contacted Dr Rikin Gogri and he gave me immediate appointments for treatment at Aurous dental clinic. The surgery to remove the wisdom tooth was done next day. It was fine and very comfortable. Thank you Dr's and specialist and even the polite staff at the clinic. I shall always go back to Aurous Dental for all my clinics. Highly recommended. One of the finest dental set up one would ever see. An amazing clinic and great ambience. Less waiting time and prompt treatment",

I booked my appointment at Dr Rikin Gogri 's Aurous Dental clinic in goregaon West.\nAfter a check up, the same day my treatment was started and the root canal was done in a single sitting. Within 2 hours I was absolutely pain free and I even got my caps done before the new year. It was very smooth, pain-free and hassle free experience.

I booked an appointment with the doctor over phone and whatsapp and visited this doctor on 9th May after asking his fee for cleaning the teeth. On visiting the doctor, the doctor told me I had a lot of tarter and on asking him if it would pain, he said he wasn't sure. He kept commenting about the amount of tartar which I was already aware about as that was the reason I needed a dentist. Procedure was completed painlessly but when the doctor said he would be charging the treatment fee but consultation fee too which is more than the amount shown here, I was taken aback as I belong to a middle class family. I contacted the doctor on whatsapp the next day asking about the same but he chose not to reply. He didn't offer any consultation with regards to any particular toothpaste I need to use or anything.",

Somehow I managed to visit Dr Rikin, at his goregaon clinic.\nHe examined me and explained me the treatment and started the treatment same day. He did a few cosmetic fillings, cleaning and a root canal. Everything was punctual, on time and very professional. The ambience and decor of clinic is soothing. Thank you for making my treatment comfortable. I would certainly recommend Dr Rikin and Aurous Dental",

Punctuality was best and there was only one patient at a given time in the clinic. I got my root canal done in 2 days and had a pleasant and pain free experience. \nThe clinic has an amazing ambience. And certainly I haven't seen any other clinic as good as this.\nThank you Dr Rikin and his staff and doctors for taking care of me.",

I wanted to get her complete treatment done in Mumbai itself and was reffered to Dr Rikin Gogri and Aurous Dental clinic by one of my friend.\nMy Mother in law had to undergo multiple tooth extractions and replacements. I thought it might a an enormous procedure, but Dr Rikin gave us a complete plan.\nWe got teeth removed and implants inserted in the mouth. He gave her temporary dentures and permanent would be done after 3 to 4 months. This all suited our usual plans.\nAll basic treatment including teeth removal, implant and temporary teeth was done in 4 sittings spread over 8 days. The specialist surgeon also was very helpful and made us at ease. Certainly I shall recommend Dr Rikin Gogri here at aurous dental in goregaon West for all dental treatments",

Her teeth were all in bad shape and we all were very negligent about it.\nOne day she got immense pain and developed swelling. We took her to 2 other dentists and she did not let them do her treatment.\nFinally when we came to aurous Dental clinic, Dr Rikin Gogri, set our appointment with a child specialist dentist.\nThey took xrays and her treatment was started same day. The first day was a little troublesome as she did not let the Dr do much, but second siting onwards, the child specialist managed to be friendly with my neice and then over the next 5 treatment sittings, she allowed all treatment to be done hasslefree. We are very happy to get her to Dr Rikin Gogri and Aurous Dental clinic. Certainly I would say the team of specialists is very impressive and they work with perfection and dedication. This wil always be my choice for dental treatment in goregaon west",

She was very good. And later Dr Rikin took our measurements for caps which were fixed after 3 days. Our entire treatment of 2 to 3 root canals and cap fixing Was completed in 3 appointments. Few things I would specifically mention is the doctors punctuality, the amazing cleanliness and good hygiene in clinic and the Dr's and staff are very very cooperative.
