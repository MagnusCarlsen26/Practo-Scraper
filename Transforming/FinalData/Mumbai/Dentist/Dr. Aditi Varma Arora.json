None of the medicines were giving her relief and as a Son; I used to feel very Bad after seeing her in such a bad Pain. Then after doing a research on Practo; i came to know about Dr Aditi and i decided to meet her and seek her opinion.\n\nOn the very first meeting itself; she explained us proper diagnosis and treatment; her explanation made us understand each and every topic clearly. We decided to go ahead with the Treatment which she prescribed us and today I am very Happy that my Mom can eat Food and she No Longer has the same terrible pain which she had earlier. \n\nWe would sincerely like to Thank Dr Aditi for helping us and definitely we as a complete family would be consulting her for any Dental problems in future as well. Along with the Dr; the support staff is excellent. \n\nMany Thanks Dr Once again for all your kind help; we sincerely appreciate it.",

None of the medicines were giving her relief and as a Son; I used to feel very Bad after seeing her in such a bad Pain. Then after doing a research on Practo; i came to know about Dr Aditi and i decided to meet her and seek her opinion.\n\nOn the very first meeting itself; she explained us proper diagnosis and treatment; her explanation made us understand each and every topic clearly. We decided to go ahead with the Treatment which she prescribed us and today I am very Happy that my Mom can eat Food and she No Longer has the same terrible pain which she had earlier. \n\nWe would sincerely like to Thank Dr Aditi for helping us and definitely we as a complete family would be consulting her for any Dental problems in future as well. Along with the Dr; the support staff is excellent. \n\nMany Thanks Dr Once again for all your kind help; we sincerely appreciate it.",

After examining the cap she explained me the pros and cons of refixing same cap vis-a-vis putting a pors fiber and building up and fixing a new cap. Based on the advice we went for permanent solution to strengthen teeth. During procedure due to some complications the procedure has to be modified and she explained the reasons to undertake modified procedure. After taking all precautions finally the tooth has been restored functionally. This tooth has decayed abruptly and while doing RCT in May 2020 in Gurgaon I new that there is bone loss and it will be very difficult to restore it. \nBut same could be achieved due to her experience, meticulous planning .\nDeepak Tandon ",

Doctor was friendly & professional during consultation - explained my problem in layman terms, didn't make me feel silly for not having gone to the dentist sooner, & shared all the alternative treatments while giving me the option to choose. Doctor took care to ensure Local Anaesthesia had set before starting surgery - didn't rush me. Was amazing during teeth extraction & abscess cleaning - gentle & firm. Accommodated my schedule for post operative followup. Dental assistant's support certainly enhanced the experience - friendly & kind.",
