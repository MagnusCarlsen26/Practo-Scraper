Not once did I feel any pain as he skillfully diverted my attention to another topic. \n\nDr. Adil gives us an appointment either on the same day or next day. We always get friendly and efficient service and the best advice. Thanks so much for going the extra mile, Dr. Adil.\n\nBest Regards,\nAditya Modi",

Not once did I feel any pain as he skillfully diverted my attention to another topic. \n\nDr. Adil gives us an appointment either on the same day or next day. We always get friendly and efficient service and the best advice. Thanks so much for going the extra mile, Dr. Adil.\n\nBest Regards,\nAditya Modi",
