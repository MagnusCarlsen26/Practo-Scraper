Dr.Akhil is very skilled with his craft and his team too is very caring and careful when it comes to your dental work. The entire process is seamless and there isn't any hidden charges or issues. The clinic is clean and caters to one's needs very well.  Watching Netflix while having your teeth worked on is a first for me and I must say was indeed a very memorable experience. I'd recommend everyone to give this experience a try atleast once, you and your teeth won't regret this decision one bit. ",
