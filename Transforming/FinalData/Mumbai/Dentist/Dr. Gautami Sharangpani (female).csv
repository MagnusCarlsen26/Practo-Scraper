"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Tooth Air Polishing,",0,0,YES,"Dr Gautami was super friendly. She made my child very comfortable  during the entire session, in fact he was really enjoying the air washing procedure as she had given him a few chances to try it out by himself under her supervision. She engaged him during the entire procedure by giving a small mirror to him so that he can see the procedure and give opinions on where actually he wanted the cleaning. It was really fun watching the scene actually. I felt so relieved watching him co-operating with the procedure, kudos to Dr.
I must say, the search of a good paediatric dentist ended at Tooth Story.
Thank you Dr Gautami for giving my son  a good dental experience.
In addition, thanks to both the supportive staffs who were very polite and well mannered and made the overall experience a magical one.
Definitely a highly recommended dental clinic.
