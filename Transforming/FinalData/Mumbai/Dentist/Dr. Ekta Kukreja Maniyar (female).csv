"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"Firstly, if you are in two minds about visiting the dentist given the covid issue, rest assured about this clinic - they have robust preventive safety measures in place to ensure that your visit is as safe as could ever be. Secondly, it is a misconception that a visit to the dentist is painful. Dr. Ekta has an friendly disposition which immediately puts you at ease while she patiently understands your problem and explains the treatment needed. The state of the art equipment and her professional expertise ensures that your treatment is complete and effective.

I would highly recommend Dr Ekta for any dental trouble.
