I don\u2019t know where to begin, but I\u2019ll start from my childhood friend Dr Sachin Mishra (BDS),he\u2019s the one took the responsibility in me and recommend to Dr Abhishek Chauhan (MDS - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, BDS) & His wife Dr. Ankita Chauhan (Implantologist) both have good experience in their relevant field and a  Good friend of Dr Sachin & now there mine too:). Absolutely wonderful people. They Run an hospital called SHARAN,name itself describe SHELTER correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Will start in 2 steps, Talking about my treatment I had to have an emergency (Plural Diastemata) this year as I was leaving for USA.And I don\u2019t want to do this Plural Diastemta in (USA) as the dental care stuff is more expensive then here so I thought to do here with the help of  Dr Sachin.The Frist step of my Diastemta is start with Frenectomy Which is to be operate by Dr Abhishek that took 2 hours for that procedure is a small fold of tissue attached to center of my upper lip gap between the upper front teeth it was done on Sunday so I haven\u2019t get the chance to see or interact with his staff as they have off on weekend. Dr.Abhishek he is very professional, yet personable and really care about my health and happiness. Working with Dr. Abhishek is always a pleasant experience with him END of Story Dr, Abhishek J.The Diastemata Second Step or  I can say The whole procedure apart from Frenectomy Which is done by Dr.Ankita. I still remember when they called me to visit there clinic to see me and click my tooth picture as part of dentistry. So I Went into their clinic and was greeted by a very friendly staff and felt comfortable through the entire process. Within my first visit I knew this office would be my primary dental office. From the receptionist, dental assistance, and the doctor- I felt like a valued patient. They both  knew I had a bad fear so  they talked me through the whole thing and made me laugh quite a bit to lighten the mood Not just for people who are very fearful of getting dental work done like myself, but also because they both is a Grade A professional at their craft.Dr.Ankita ** *** **** ** ********* *** has a great team of family and staff. They are all top of the line professionals, with superb workwomen ship, artistry and state of the art equipment. A lab on site, and TV/DVD for his/her patients to watch while waiting, or just to relax, if they wish. They have other Hi-Tech equipment, as well, to achieve a precision alignment, which goes hand in hand with that perfect smile. I Was having poor teeth for about 15 years. She has transformed all of my ugly teeth into a beautiful smile.my teeth look better now, than when I was 25. I thought there was no hope, unless I spent a fortune. Their fees are very reasonable, and affordable for all incomes, and She will work with you. She is very caring, compassionate, and patient with a desire to make her patients happy with their results. Dr. Ankita is also very good with children, and has a way of making them calm and relaxed. She will always be my dentist, and even though I will be living hundreds of miles away, I will fly or drive to SHARAN Smile Dental, for all of my dental needs. If you need quality work, at an affordable price, then you need to call Dr. Abhishek or Dr.Ankita to set up an appointment. You will thank God you did. I do every day....Thank you so much!\n\nThank you Dr. Ankita  for the great experience and quality work you have done on my teeth. I am usually apprehensive about needles and it was no sweat at all. In fact, I am ready for the next needle, thanks to your gentle touch. My family and I have been pleased with your professional, yet personable, service.\n\nSee you soon.",

I had visited  3-4 dentist earlier but i have never got permanent solution on my teeth problem. Now i'm satisfied with my treatment from Dr. Ankita chauhan.

                "review_text": "Well! I don\u2019t know where to begin, but I\u2019ll start from my childhood friend Dr Sachin Mishra (BDS),he\u2019s the one took the responsibility in me and recommend to Dr Abhishek Chauhan (MDS - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, BDS) & His wife Dr. Ankita Chauhan (Implantologist) both have good experience in their relevant field and a  Good friend of Dr Sachin & now there mine too:). Absolutely wonderful people. They Run an hospital called SHARAN,name itself describe SHELTER correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Will start in 2 steps, Talking about my treatment I had to have an emergency (Plural Diastemata) this year as I was leaving for USA.And I don\u2019t want to do this Plural Diastemta in (USA) as the dental care stuff is more expensive then here so I thought to do here with the help of  Dr Sachin.The Frist step of my Diastemta is start with Frenectomy Which is to be operate by Dr Abhishek that took 2 hours for that procedure is a small fold of tissue attached to center of my upper lip gap between the upper front teeth it was done on Sunday so I haven\u2019t get the chance to see or interact with his staff as they have off on weekend. Dr.Abhishek he is very professional, yet personable and really care about my health and happiness. Working with Dr. Abhishek is always a pleasant experience with him END of Story Dr, Abhishek J.The Diastemata Second Step or  I can say The whole procedure apart from Frenectomy Which is done by Dr.Ankita. I still remember when they called me to visit there clinic to see me and click my tooth picture as part of dentistry. So I Went into their clinic and was greeted by a very friendly staff and felt comfortable through the entire process. Within my first visit I knew this office would be my primary dental office. From the receptionist, dental assistance, and the doctor- I felt like a valued patient. They both  knew I had a bad fear so  they talked me through the whole thing and made me laugh quite a bit to lighten the mood Not just for people who are very fearful of getting dental work done like myself, but also because they both is a Grade A professional at their craft.Dr.Ankita ** *** **** ** ********* *** has a great team of family and staff. They are all top of the line professionals, with superb workwomen ship, artistry and state of the art equipment. A lab on site, and TV/DVD for his/her patients to watch while waiting, or just to relax, if they wish. They have other Hi-Tech equipment, as well, to achieve a precision alignment, which goes hand in hand with that perfect smile. I Was having poor teeth for about 15 years. She has transformed all of my ugly teeth into a beautiful smile.my teeth look better now, than when I was 25. I thought there was no hope, unless I spent a fortune. Their fees are very reasonable, and affordable for all incomes, and She will work with you. She is very caring, compassionate, and patient with a desire to make her patients happy with their results. Dr. Ankita is also very good with children, and has a way of making them calm and relaxed. She will always be my dentist, and even though I will be living hundreds of miles away, I will fly or drive to SHARAN Smile Dental, for all of my dental needs. If you need quality work, at an affordable price, then you need to call Dr. Abhishek or Dr.Ankita to set up an appointment. You will thank God you did. I do every day....Thank you so much!\n\nThank you Dr. Ankita  for the great experience and quality work you have done on my teeth. I am usually apprehensive about needles and it was no sweat at all. In fact, I am ready for the next needle, thanks to your gentle touch. My family and I have been pleased with your professional, yet personable, service.\n\nSee you soon.",

I had visited  3-4 dentist earlier but i have never got permanent solution on my teeth problem. Now i'm satisfied with my treatment from Dr. Ankita chauhan.  After a long experience ,I can say it with conviction that she's one of the finest dentist I met.\n",
