Also expensive for the quality provided.,2021-02-20 13:23:41,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hello. Thank you for visiting our clinic for teeth cleaning / Scaling.  We understand that you were expecting different results after teeth cleaning. Let us explain to you once again the procedure that you visited for. Teeth Cleaning is a procedure to remove plaque and tartar which helps to keep your gums and teeth healthy.  The scaling / teeth cleaning procedure was done properly and thoroughly.  In your case after scaling, your teeth were still yellowish because of the long-term stains from every day food like tea coffee, haldi, colas, etc which cannot be removed by scaling and a cosmetic procedure called Teeth Whitening can be availed.  Stains that cannot be removed by cleaning can be made lighter by a procedure called Teeth Whitening which is recommended for those who want whiter teeth. The Teeth Whitening procedure was explained to you in detail. While many desire whiter teeth, we have to understand that teeth cleaning and teeth whitening are both separate procedures. Teeth Cleaning by a dentist is an option when regular cleaning by an individual may not suffice to maintain good oral hygiene and is essential for good health reasons. Teeth Whitening is a cosmetic procedure which is optional only to make teeth whiter and provides no health benefits.

We hope we have been able to once again explain to you and be rest assured that your teeth cleaning has been done properly. However, in case if there are still some concerns you have, please feel free to take an appointment and we would love to see you again as our entire team at 32 Pearls strive 100% in providing everyone the best dental care.

Thanks.",2021-02-22T09:17:23+0000,Dr. Reshma Phulwar
