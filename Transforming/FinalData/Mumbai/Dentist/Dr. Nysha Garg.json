She took initiative herself to ask for feedback and was always available in case of any problem. If she is your Dentist you don't need anyone else !

She has a TV right above your head while the scaling process is going on. The equipment which she has is very modern and quite impressive.I would definitely visit the clinic twice a year for checkup and I feel everyone in India should have a dental check-up done once a year",

To answer each of your queries point by point. 1) We are a Multispeciality Practice, where like any other Advance Multispeciality Center each treatment is done by the Specialist(M.D.S.) in that field, for example Root Canal Therapy by M.D.S. Endodontist, Crown and bridge by M.D.S. Prosthodontist. This is done to ensure perfection in all our treatments. We had discussed the same with you during your first visit and thus scheduled an appointment later in the day for same with our M.D.S. Endodontist. 2) Your chief complaint was  \u201ccleaning of the lower right last tooth\u201d. On clinical and radiographical examination of the concerned wisdom tooth, it was found to be decayed with pulpal involvement. Ideal treatment for this is Root Canal Therapy followed by filling and cap, hence was suggested. 3) Pain is unavoidable part of root canal therapy which needs to be managed properly. We always give our patients 24 by 7 contact number to get back to us. In your case we saw you next day when you were fine and called you for a follow up appointment after a day which you could not come, since you were travelling. In our conversation a week later, again no discomfort was conveyed to us. We aim at helping our patients even after treatment is over when approached. 4) Practo sharing of files had some technical error, so we had sent you by a different means, and also raised the concern with Practo back office team and I believe it\u2019s taken care off since I received a confirmation email. 5) Our facility is open for full day so we can spread out our appointments for no waiting time and comfort of patients and doctors. \nPlease feel free to talk to us or visit us anytime, if you have any discomfort and/or any concerns  . Thanks & Regards, Team DentEase",

The absence of pain was another pleasant surprise. The treatment got done quickly and the results were amazing. I've now decided to trust Dr. Nysha Garg with all my dental treatments in the future.

The whole place felt very cozy, clean and hygienic. I have this phobia of hospitals but this one felt  like at home and the treatment was painless. The doctor and the staff were very cordial. She also took time to explain me how to maintain teeth after treatment in everyday routine as well how to help my toddler  do the same. I recommend Dr Nysha anytime.",

To answer each of your queries point by point. 1) We are a Multispeciality Practice, where like any other Advance Multispeciality Center each treatment is done by the Specialist(M.D.S.) in that field, for example Root Canal Therapy by M.D.S. Endodontist, Crown and bridge by M.D.S. Prosthodontist. This is done to ensure perfection in all our treatments. We had discussed the same with you during your first visit and thus scheduled an appointment later in the day for same with our M.D.S. Endodontist. 2) Your chief complaint was  \u201ccleaning of the lower right last tooth\u201d. On clinical and radiographical examination of the concerned wisdom tooth, it was found to be decayed with pulpal involvement. Ideal treatment for this is Root Canal Therapy followed by filling and cap, hence was suggested. 3) Pain is unavoidable part of root canal therapy which needs to be managed properly. We always give our patients 24 by 7 contact number to get back to us. In your case we saw you next day when you were fine and called you for a follow up appointment after a day which you could not come, since you were travelling. In our conversation a week later, again no discomfort was conveyed to us. We aim at helping our patients even after treatment is over when approached. 4) Practo sharing of files had some technical error, so we had sent you by a different means, and also raised the concern with Practo back office team and I believe it\u2019s taken care off since I received a confirmation email. 5) Our facility is open for full day so we can spread out our appointments for no waiting time and comfort of patients and doctors. \nPlease feel free to talk to us or visit us anytime, if you have any discomfort and/or any concerns  . Thanks & Regards, Team DentEase",

The absence of pain was another pleasant surprise. The treatment got done quickly and the results were amazing. I've now decided to trust Dr. Nysha Garg with all my dental treatments in the future.
