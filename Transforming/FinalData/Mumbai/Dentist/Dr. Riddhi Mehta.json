I was given an emergency tablet if in case my pain was not bearable but fortunately that did not take place .So over all this dentist has helped me a lot in my terrible situation and made my teeth\u2019s and gums all perfect in just few days. Yes the pain was gone !!!! And I was happy. All thanks to my dentist for giving me the best and quick treatment ",

Yes the pain was gone !!!! And I was happy. All thanks to my dentist for giving me the best and quick treatment ",
