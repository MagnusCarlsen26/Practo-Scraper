I first made the mistake of taking my 5 year child to a regular dentist. After couple treatments, visiting the doctor become a nightmare for my kid. He was terrified. Next experience was with a pediatric who was focused on forcefully recommending expensive treatments that were actually not required. Cosmetic dentistry such as Zirconia tooth implants for teeth that would fall off within couple years. I then started surfing the net to find a good dentist for my child. I discovered Dr Rachaytas profile on Practo and was impressed on reading the patient feedback.  We did multiple treatments and each visit has been smooth and happy for my child. The ambiance is exciting for kids my son insists going there again to play with the toys. Dr Rachayta easily connects with the kids and they completely co-operate with her during the entire procedure. *** ** ** ********* ********* ****** ****** *** **** *** I need to go to my child during the procedure. Not surprising, as Dr is a gold medalist. It seemed I had taken him to a play area and not a dentist. Treatment costs are less than market or at par. No over treatment or fancy treatment is recommended. Dr  Parikh Gala keeps sufficient gap between patients so we could spend considerable time discussing the issue and its treatment. I have to travel 35 kms to visit the doctor but believe me its worth it!! \n",

But Dr. Rachayta has a way with kids. In our first visit itself the Dr. formed a very good rapport with my daughter, she was cooperative, happy and at ease throughout the treatment.  The clinic and all the staff are extremely child friendly. Even our consecutive visits were very smooth, in fact my daughter looked forward to visiting the clinic. \nDr. Rachayta explained the issue at hand and all treatment options very clearly before we started on things. She was extremely patient and engaged my chatty 2 year old very well. She was also was very accommodative of last minute schedule changes considering a toddlers mood and sleep patterns.\n\nOverall it was an excellent experience and I would totally recommend Dr. Rachayta",

The clinic has a  collection of story books, balls, toys, etc., which keeps the child engrossed, till his / her appointment turns up.\n\nNow coming to the treatment: \nMy kid had a habit of lip biting. Owing to this, his lower jaw and upper jaw are misaligned. Via a known source, I hence approached Dr Rachayta for an opinion. I was very convinced with the way she approached towards the treatment of the same. She was very friendly with my child(and with other children as well) and that really made him comfortable during the treatment. \n\nHer follow - ups were (are) also regular and an history of the same is also being maintained to monitor the progress.\n\nVery attentive to what the parents and kids are saying and based on the same she takes the approach of the treatment. *** ********* ******* *** ********* ********* ** ******\n\nVery much happy with the way my kid has progressed in the treatment.",

The walls, decor have cartoon characters making it look like a play area more than a doctor's clinic. The bright yellow chair for kods to sit while being treated complete the ambience.\n\n2. The doctor seems to have lot of experience dealing with children, so first 5 or 10 minutes went in her talking to my son (about his age, school, favorite cartoon etc) thus making him comfortable.\n\n3. After having a look at his teeth, she explained tge situation and treatment in a very simple yet factual manner. The child is engaged on the screen at the patient's chair watching cartoons all the while.\n\n4. In a friendly way she told my son that she was going to extract his tooth and it would pain slightly. I appreciate this honesty rather than shocking him later. \n\n5. The actual extraction took less than 2 mins. It was effortless for my son and for us too! Finally my son got superhero stickers for being brave!\n\nI am glad his first experience with a dentist was so good, that helped hum create a positive association with dentists for future.",

I first made the mistake of taking my 5 year child to a regular dentist. After couple treatments, visiting the doctor become a nightmare for my kid. He was terrified. Next experience was with a pediatric who was focused on forcefully recommending expensive treatments that were actually not required. Cosmetic dentistry such as Zirconia tooth implants for teeth that would fall off within couple years. I then started surfing the net to find a good dentist for my child. I discovered Dr Rachaytas profile on Practo and was impressed on reading the patient feedback.  We did multiple treatments and each visit has been smooth and happy for my child. The ambiance is exciting for kids my son insists going there again to play with the toys. Dr Rachayta easily connects with the kids and they completely co-operate with her during the entire procedure. *** ** ** ********* ********* ****** ****** *** **** *** I need to go to my child during the procedure. Not surprising, as Dr is a gold medalist. It seemed I had taken him to a play area and not a dentist. Treatment costs are less than market or at par. No over treatment or fancy treatment is recommended. Dr  Parikh Gala keeps sufficient gap between patients so we could spend considerable time discussing the issue and its treatment. I have to travel 35 kms to visit the doctor but believe me its worth it!! \n",

The clinic and all the staff are extremely child friendly. Even our consecutive visits were very smooth, in fact my daughter looked forward to visiting the clinic. \nDr. Rachayta explained the issue at hand and all treatment options very clearly before we started on things. She was extremely patient and engaged my chatty 2 year old very well. She was also was very accommodative of last minute schedule changes considering a toddlers mood and sleep patterns.\n\nOverall it was an excellent experience and I would totally recommend Dr. Rachayta",

The clinic has a  collection of story books, balls, toys, etc., which keeps the child engrossed, till his / her appointment turns up.\n\nNow coming to the treatment: \nMy kid had a habit of lip biting. Owing to this, his lower jaw and upper jaw are misaligned. Via a known source, I hence approached Dr Rachayta for an opinion. I was very convinced with the way she approached towards the treatment of the same. She was very friendly with my child(and with other children as well) and that really made him comfortable during the treatment. \n\nHer follow - ups were (are) also regular and an history of the same is also being maintained to monitor the progress.\n\nVery attentive to what the parents and kids are saying and based on the same she takes the approach of the treatment. *** ********* ******* *** ********* ********* ** ******\n\nVery much happy with the way my kid has progressed in the treatment.",

The walls, decor have cartoon characters making it look like a play area more than a doctor's clinic. The bright yellow chair for kods to sit while being treated complete the ambience.\n\n2. The doctor seems to have lot of experience dealing with children, so first 5 or 10 minutes went in her talking to my son (about his age, school, favorite cartoon etc) thus making him comfortable.\n\n3. After having a look at his teeth, she explained tge situation and treatment in a very simple yet factual manner. The child is engaged on the screen at the patient's chair watching cartoons all the while.\n\n4. In a friendly way she told my son that she was going to extract his tooth and it would pain slightly. I appreciate this honesty rather than shocking him later. \n\n5. The actual extraction took less than 2 mins. It was effortless for my son and for us too! Finally my son got superhero stickers for being brave!\n\nI am glad his first experience with a dentist was so good, that helped hum create a positive association with dentists for future.",

So much so that my other child who is almost 3 year old actually insisted on being examined by her!  Highly recommend this clinic!",

He felt like it was more of a friend talking about it rather than an adult advising him. He already seems to be making an effort in the right direction. I am hoping with the appliance, the habit will  fade away soon without any long term consequences.",
