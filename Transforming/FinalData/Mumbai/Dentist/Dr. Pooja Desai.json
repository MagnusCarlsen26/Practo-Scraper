Finally decided to visit Dr Pooja after a friend's recommendation. Starting with the way she spoke on the call ( very friendly) to accomodating me amidst all her appointments because I was in pain. She even made me completely stress free about the covid situation as she ensured that the clinic is not cramped up. She guided me to the clinic very patiently even though it's pretty easy to locate. Then comes the real part. She put me at complete ease explained me the situation so well and made me aware of why it's important to do certain things right in a root canal treatment. She convinced me to start with the procedure because the situation was bad and immediate attention needs to be given. First she put me at complete ease and ensured that nothing will go further if I am uncomfortable or in pain. Then she started with the real magic. She patiently did the procedure ensuring at no given point I was in pain, if I was then she immediately stopped and made sure I am not. I cannot believe I am saying this but I cannot wait to go back to her and complete my treatment. She was like a family member and looked after me just like my elder sister. She is a very warm and honest medical practitioner. I can only say that I have gained my dentist for life and I am at complete ease if at all I need any attention for my oral hygiene. Thank you Dr Pooja for converting a complete anti dental person to someone who wants to ensure that regular visits will be done. Thank you for everything. Thank you for making this procedure completely painless and easy.\nAnyone reading this, don't even think once before visiting Dr Pooja because she is indeed the best dentist in town ",

Secondly the root canal treatment not being felt is only taken as a compliment as we try our best to offer painless root canal treatments and take quite a few xrays before the process is started during the treatment and once completed which are enough proofs of the treatment being done and done correctly . \nThirdly if we are ready to offer a patient any kind of warranty commitment we stick to it as promised and ready to repair damages if any within the time frame mentioned only if the patient is ready to revisit the clinic . \nRequest you to take time off from your busy schedule come over for a verbal discussion or clarification if any rather than being harsh on social media . Every negative feedback received if always our top priority as our motto has always been to attain a happy satisfied patient .",

Inspite of not creating a scene there n clearing the full payment on time I was told m rude n accusing them. I told them that they shouldve told me before on that they said they did .They offered me the money back but I didnt take as I dont take favours.

Finally decided to visit Dr Pooja after a friend's recommendation. Starting with the way she spoke on the call ( very friendly) to accomodating me amidst all her appointments because I was in pain. She even made me completely stress free about the covid situation as she ensured that the clinic is not cramped up. She guided me to the clinic very patiently even though it's pretty easy to locate. Then comes the real part. She put me at complete ease explained me the situation so well and made me aware of why it's important to do certain things right in a root canal treatment. She convinced me to start with the procedure because the situation was bad and immediate attention needs to be given. First she put me at complete ease and ensured that nothing will go further if I am uncomfortable or in pain. Then she started with the real magic. She patiently did the procedure ensuring at no given point I was in pain, if I was then she immediately stopped and made sure I am not. I cannot believe I am saying this but I cannot wait to go back to her and complete my treatment. She was like a family member and looked after me just like my elder sister. She is a very warm and honest medical practitioner. I can only say that I have gained my dentist for life and I am at complete ease if at all I need any attention for my oral hygiene. Thank you Dr Pooja for converting a complete anti dental person to someone who wants to ensure that regular visits will be done. Thank you for everything. Thank you for making this procedure completely painless and easy.\nAnyone reading this, don't even think once before visiting Dr Pooja because she is indeed the best dentist in town ",

Secondly the root canal treatment not being felt is only taken as a compliment as we try our best to offer painless root canal treatments and take quite a few xrays before the process is started during the treatment and once completed which are enough proofs of the treatment being done and done correctly . \nThirdly if we are ready to offer a patient any kind of warranty commitment we stick to it as promised and ready to repair damages if any within the time frame mentioned only if the patient is ready to revisit the clinic . \nRequest you to take time off from your busy schedule come over for a verbal discussion or clarification if any rather than being harsh on social media . Every negative feedback received if always our top priority as our motto has always been to attain a happy satisfied patient .",

Inspite of not creating a scene there n clearing the full payment on time I was told m rude n accusing them. I told them that they shouldve told me before on that they said they did .They offered me the money back but I didnt take as I dont take favours.
