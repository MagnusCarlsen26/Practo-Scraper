,,0,0,YES,"I had encountered a fatal bike accident few weeks back and had a broken jaw line.
My entire family visits Belle32 Dental care at Andheri West clinic since last few years and so we immediately called Dr.Kruti as soon as we reached the hospital. After my treatment in the OT, she helped me get the jaw line restored along with getting my teeth aligned for the next few days. Now my smile looks much much better. She did my full mouth restoration job so well that it doesn't seem I had a broken jaw ever!

Her approach towards the treatment is really good as she tries to keep the natural tooth than getting all tooth implants done and that's what is her USP which they call Preventive Dentistry which is so beneficial for a patient.

I wish Dr.Kruti at Belle32 Dental care great success. I will always be indebted to her help at every stage of the treatment.
