I have 15 years of experience and over 1000 satisfied patients and I would not like to even have a single unhappy patient, I am still open to welcome  her to my clinic and explain the treatment!",

I have 15 years of experience and over 1000 satisfied patients and I would not like to even have a single unhappy patient, I am still open to welcome  her to my clinic and explain the treatment!",

She diagnosed the problem properly and explained all the options before proceeding with the treatment. She was very professional and confident throughout this treatment which was really reassuring for me. One of the virtues I must point out is her patience, particularly during complicated procedures. I never found her in hurry during this treatment and did not bother about number of sessions she needed for this RCT.This is the second time I took treatment from her and the experience has been splendid on both the occasions. I highly recommend her.",
