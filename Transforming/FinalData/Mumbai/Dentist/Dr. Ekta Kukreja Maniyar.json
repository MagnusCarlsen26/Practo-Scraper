Secondly, it is a misconception that a visit to the dentist is painful. Dr. Ekta has an friendly disposition which immediately puts you at ease while she patiently understands your problem and explains the treatment needed. The state of the art equipment and her professional expertise ensures that your treatment is complete and effective. I must add that this is the first doctor I've met who herself follows up with the patient to enquire about his recovery and condition after treatment and schedules followup visits till she's satisfied with the totality of the treatment. I would highly recommend Dr Ekta for any dental trouble. ",

Secondly, it is a misconception that a visit to the dentist is painful. Dr. Ekta has an friendly disposition which immediately puts you at ease while she patiently understands your problem and explains the treatment needed. The state of the art equipment and her professional expertise ensures that your treatment is complete and effective. I must add that this is the first doctor I've met who herself follows up with the patient to enquire about his recovery and condition after treatment and schedules followup visits till she's satisfied with the totality of the treatment. I would highly recommend Dr Ekta for any dental trouble. ",
