After my treatment in the OT, she helped me get the jaw line restored along with getting my teeth aligned for the next few days. Now my smile looks much much better. She did my full mouth restoration job so well that it doesn't seem I had a broken jaw ever!\n\nHer approach towards the treatment is really good as she tries to keep the natural tooth than getting all tooth implants done and that's what is her USP which they call Preventive Dentistry which is so beneficial for a patient.\n\nI wish Dr.Kruti at Belle32 Dental care great success. I will always be indebted to her help at every stage of the treatment.\nCheers!",

After my treatment in the OT, she helped me get the jaw line restored along with getting my teeth aligned for the next few days. Now my smile looks much much better. She did my full mouth restoration job so well that it doesn't seem I had a broken jaw ever!\n\nHer approach towards the treatment is really good as she tries to keep the natural tooth than getting all tooth implants done and that's what is her USP which they call Preventive Dentistry which is so beneficial for a patient.\n\nI wish Dr.Kruti at Belle32 Dental care great success. I will always be indebted to her help at every stage of the treatment.\nCheers!",
