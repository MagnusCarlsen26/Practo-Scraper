Many doctors seem to assume that you know what to pay and will be ok with paying for subsequent sessions etc. Dr. Malik is very transparent and makes you aware of this right at the beginning. She quotes a fee for the treatment, inclusive of all multiple sessions that may be required for completion of the treatment. \n3. Doesn't recommend further action until she is sure what is required (in my case, wait for all sessions of cleaning+polishing, before evaluating for cavities and further course of action)\n4. Of course my experience with the actual treatment has also been good. \nI think with Meeta I have found a dentist who I can visit regularly. I would recommend her to everyone.",

She is qualified and honest.not into the business of minting money. She would recommend you the right solution irrespective of cost. Most of all she is considerate and patient while handling case.

Many doctors seem to assume that you know what to pay and will be ok with paying for subsequent sessions etc. Dr. Malik is very transparent and makes you aware of this right at the beginning. She quotes a fee for the treatment, inclusive of all multiple sessions that may be required for completion of the treatment. \n3. Doesn't recommend further action until she is sure what is required (in my case, wait for all sessions of cleaning+polishing, before evaluating for cavities and further course of action)\n4. Of course my experience with the actual treatment has also been good. \nI think with Meeta I have found a dentist who I can visit regularly. I would recommend her to everyone.",

Switching dentist to find one who is honest, tells you the tal problem, takes ownership of patient and the treatment. Does not shrugs responsibility after treatment.  The search ended at Dr. meeta. She is qualified and honest.not into the business of minting money. She would recommend you the right solution irrespective of cost. Most of all she is considerate and patient while handling case. I was a tough one everytime but she was so gentle that I never hesitated to go to dentist after I met her. ",

As we had discussed in your first consultation, the best course of action at the time was deep cleaning as your symptoms involved pain across multiple teeth and gum bleeding. And in case the same did not work, then only to do root canal treatment( RCT). Our intention is always to try to save the tooth without conducting an invasive procedure like a RCT. Sorry if you felt dissatisfied with the recommended course but we had your best interest in mind. Happy to know you are pain free now and please do feel free to let us know if we can help in any way.
