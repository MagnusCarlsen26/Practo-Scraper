Upon initial screening, doctor advised me that cavities are developing in about 7-8 number of teeth overall. After the cleaning was completed, she asked me for fillings. Again it was my mistake to not understand the expenses. Upon further enquiry she gave me a estimate per teeth basis. After starting, her estimate suddenly changed from total of 7-8 cavities in all to 9 cavities on each side (total 18). * *** * ***** ************* **** * ** ***** ******** Anyways I completed 1 side. The bill came out to be exorbitant. I asked for receipt and diagnosis. It was not provided and was told that it will be emailed. I waited for 1 week, but did not get any email. Visited the clinic again. The doctor said some issues with the computer system. Then reluctantly provided me with the bill but again no diagnosis. On further asking, a general diagnosis was provided. I was taken aback by the ethics or opaque nature of information provided along with inflated bills. Disappointed by the whole experience.",

I was shown on screen via cam the affected areas of concern - a first for me. I have visited dentists in Singapore, Germany and China and none utilized such technology. It was very useful and informative.\n\nThe clinic kept to the appointed times, with minimal waiting. Very efficient and well organised, with SMS follow up and confirmations.\n\nAll in all, I was very impressed with the high standards of Dr Rajendra and his clinic.",

Upon initial screening, doctor advised me that cavities are developing in about 7-8 number of teeth overall. After the cleaning was completed, she asked me for fillings. Again it was my mistake to not understand the expenses. Upon further enquiry she gave me a estimate per teeth basis. After starting, her estimate suddenly changed from total of 7-8 cavities in all to 9 cavities on each side (total 18). * *** * ***** ************* **** * ** ***** ******** Anyways I completed 1 side. The bill came out to be exorbitant. I asked for receipt and diagnosis. It was not provided and was told that it will be emailed. I waited for 1 week, but did not get any email. Visited the clinic again. The doctor said some issues with the computer system. Then reluctantly provided me with the bill but again no diagnosis. On further asking, a general diagnosis was provided. I was taken aback by the ethics or opaque nature of information provided along with inflated bills. Disappointed by the whole experience.",
