The fact that she explains the issue and the solution she's going to apply makes the treatment easier for a patient. She's one of those handful doctors who educate and want their patients to know their case firsthand. Not only do I trust her more because of that, but I am also more comfortable with getting my treatment done from her. \n\nI recently visited her to get my wisdom tooth extracted. At one instance, she told me that it may hurt. Interestingly, I was expecting pain, but the treatment completed and I didn't even realize!",

Truly speaking the thought of visiting a dentist sent fear and shock waves through my mind as I had very bitter experiences in the past. I used to avoid seeing them.. But as per recommendation I visited Dr.Vandita and she was very gentle at checking and telling me about my tooth issues. I got a root canal and a tooth extraction treatment done from her after that. And she has given the best treatment to me. She is surely the best dentist in Bombay. I have developed trust and confidence that Dr.Vandita will give the best treatment. Thank you Dr.Vandita, with you around I am not afraid of getting any teeth treatment done.. ",

But as per recommendation I visited Dr.Vandita and she was very gentle at checking and telling me about my tooth issues. I got a root canal and a tooth extraction treatment done from her after that. And she has given the best treatment to me. She is surely the best dentist in Bombay. I have developed trust and confidence that Dr.Vandita will give the best treatment.
