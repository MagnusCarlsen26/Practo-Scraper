Also we have maintained all pre op and post op pics, we request you and your monther please visit us as per your convenience. We would like to again personally explain to your mother your treatment plan for her satisfaction.\n\nIf you want, we would like to also discuss your treatment plan and pictures of your teeth with another dentist of your choice so that you can have a second opinion.\n\nRequest you to understand that at all points before starting any treatment we reconfirmed our prices with you. You also confirmed the prices with your mother. We assure you that we maintain full transparency in our prices and we are extremely sorry you feel this way.
