There were many complication and I was definitely very worried about the dental issues. I found Doctor Rinal very calm, composed and she will always try to accommodate me in terms of my specific issues regarding dental. She made me so comfortable and best part is every time I visited she would remember my specific issues with out mentioning as well. My comfort was her priority, every time I went and she has instructed that to her staff as well. She used different methods to keep me at ease and always had hygiene and safety too priority. Her clinic is neat and clean with all modern infrastructure. Disposable items were used wherever possible and every time, there was no compromise in any of the hygiene issues. She has a very good team of doctors and staff.\nThe best thing I liked about her is that she makes her patients comfortable to the treatment first and then gradually goes about her activity regarding any issues for Dental Care. Wonderful experience and best doctor to work with for sure",

The minute I walked in the surgery i was impressed with the ambience and the quality of the chair and the modern facilities\nDay one:  Rinal greeted me and sited me in the chair She explained that she would have to see what is apparent by examination an she asked me about the issues and pain I was having and my compliant about food getting lodged into the right upper teeth .She then asked me to go for an X ray to determine what she would recommend to be done. The X-ray unit is external and I am surprised why Apollo does not have an inhouse unit for this circular XRAY?.\nDay Two Rinal called me to say that X rays have been checked and considerable amount of work needs to be done so for root canal had arranged for specialist next day ..This was impressive as I was not aware I had a root canal issue .any how she advised the damage and the price for each route canal treatment since time was short for me I asked her to go ahead and  confirm the time for next appointment\nDay three Rinal introduced me to Dr.Siddhu who explained the root canal treatment plan which I consented to the whole process went very smooth well performed y Dr.Siddhu and well co ordinated by Rinal and dental assistant! Of course advise was given on pain and when the anaesthetic wears off !Two root canals were completed in 2 hours ! Great job well done\nDay Four Dr,Rinal took all the measurements for the crown preparation and was quite meticulous with the approach and prepared the tooth for getting the crown done after  three days\nDay 5 Dental assistant called me how I was feeling and if was in pain but said managed with the Pain killer pescried an soft food!\nDay 6.Rinal was ready to test and take further measurements for the crown and cco on the root canal treatment done >all very well done and was assured of the best service for the crown preparation by external lab ad for fitting next day fitting\nDay 8. wisdom tooth extraction was well done by Dr.Punit Shah dental l surgeon after having explained the process First class Extraction and Was very relived as tooth was decaying and had a huge hole in it! Job well done !\n\nDay 9 The crowns were ready and fitted and Rinal did further adjustments as my bite ! which had changed as I was eating from right side only following extraction of Left wisdom tooth. She checked it and cleaned a bit a as healing was a bit slow on the tooth! Thanks good advice and guidance again from Rinal \nDay 10 The crown a bit uncomfortable as it was set too high and in the process one of my old  filling was noticed to have broken. Any how Rinal reset the crown feels better after adjustment and also  did the filling of the tooth ..great jo all done said  Adios to both senioritas'\nGuys an dolls sorry this is a t long winded and boring but I always fear dental treatment but Rinal did it like a Bolly wood movie with a good ending \nThe entire process was so wonderfully executed by Rinal and her specialist team I am suitable impressed wit the quality of the treatment and plan as well as execution and would not hesitate recommending her in future to anyone! \nHappy New Year 2089",

I had lost all my molars and premolars and continued with this condition, since 2 decades. I was very scared to go to a dentist, specially after being a diabetic. \nI approached Dr. Rinal through a reference. She is very structured, organised, skilled lovely person. I took the decision of continuing the treatement with her in my first consultancy.\nFollowing was the procedure:\nConsultancy\nAfter a preliminary thorough oral inspection, she asked me to get a scan dent X ray. She with her team identified the problem and treatement. Then she explained me the entire process and expenses to restore my lost teeth, very patiently answering all my queries and initiated my courage to go forward.\nTreatement\nStep 1.\nFirst she got all my rudimentary molar fragments extracted painlessly, and waited for the gums to heal properly before next step.\nStep 2.\nShe did the fillings and cleaning required.after a week\nStep 3\nThen one by one they got totally 7 implants fixed in my mouth in the order\n2 lower right, 2 lower left, 2 upper left and 1 upper right, in about three to four sittings. Giving a break of one week or two weeks as the demand of healing.\nAfter all implants were installed, they checked the position by taking xrays, till they were satisfied thoroughly.\nStep 4 \nThey waited for about 6 months.\nThen they did the fixing of abutments followed by crowns. The measurements for crowns were taken accurately till they were perfect. Then they fixed the crowns matching the colour shade with my original teeth colour.\nThe whole process took a year, since i had gone to USA for family visit for about six months, before step 4.\nResult\nI got my complete set of teeth for healthy living at the age of 60. I got my confidence and smile back. No one thinks they are false teeth. They look so real. I am very comfortable and dont look my age of 60.\nAll thanks to Dr. Rinal Modi, she is an Angel and her team of Apollo dentists.\nGod Bless Her and All.\nHad it not been for Rinal, i would not have got my teeth back. I was very skeptic and nervous about the whole issue, but her reassuring and comforting methods propelled and energised me to take this final decision. And look how I am so happy now. All hugs to Dr. RINAL\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude43",

She made me so comfortable and best part is every time I visited she would remember my specific issues with out mentioning as well. My comfort was her priority, every time I went and she has instructed that to her staff as well. She used different methods to keep me at ease and always had hygiene and safety too priority. Her clinic is neat and clean with all modern infrastructure. Disposable items were used wherever possible and every time, there was no compromise in any of the hygiene issues. She has a very good team of doctors and staff.\nThe best thing I liked about her is that she makes her patients comfortable to the treatment first and then gradually goes about her activity regarding any issues for Dental Care.

The minute I walked in the surgery i was impressed with the ambience and the quality of the chair and the modern facilities\nDay one:  Rinal greeted me and sited me in the chair She explained that she would have to see what is apparent by examination an she asked me about the issues and pain I was having and my compliant about food getting lodged into the right upper teeth .She then asked me to go for an X ray to determine what she would recommend to be done. The X-ray unit is external and I am surprised why Apollo does not have an inhouse unit for this circular XRAY?.\nDay Two Rinal called me to say that X rays have been checked and considerable amount of work needs to be done so for root canal had arranged for specialist next day ..This was impressive as I was not aware I had a root canal issue .any how she advised the damage and the price for each route canal treatment since time was short for me I asked her to go ahead and  confirm the time for next appointment\nDay three Rinal introduced me to Dr.Siddhu who explained the root canal treatment plan which I consented to the whole process went very smooth well performed y Dr.Siddhu and well co ordinated by Rinal and dental assistant! Of course advise was given on pain and when the anaesthetic wears off !Two root canals were completed in 2 hours ! Great job well done\nDay Four Dr,Rinal took all the measurements for the crown preparation and was quite meticulous with the approach and prepared the tooth for getting the crown done after  three days\nDay 5 Dental assistant called me how I was feeling and if was in pain but said managed with the Pain killer pescried an soft food!\nDay 6.Rinal was ready to test and take further measurements for the crown and cco on the root canal treatment done >all very well done and was assured of the best service for the crown preparation by external lab ad for fitting next day fitting\nDay 8. wisdom tooth extraction was well done by Dr.Punit Shah dental l surgeon after having explained the process First class Extraction and Was very relived as tooth was decaying and had a huge hole in it! Job well done !\n\nDay 9 The crowns were ready and fitted and Rinal did further adjustments as my bite ! which had changed as I was eating from right side only following extraction of Left wisdom tooth. She checked it and cleaned a bit a as healing was a bit slow on the tooth! Thanks good advice and guidance again from Rinal \nDay 10 The crown a bit uncomfortable as it was set too high and in the process one of my old  filling was noticed to have broken. Any how Rinal reset the crown feels better after adjustment and also  did the filling of the tooth ..great jo all done said  Adios to both senioritas'\nGuys an dolls sorry this is a t long winded and boring but I always fear dental treatment but Rinal did it like a Bolly wood movie with a good ending \nThe entire process was so wonderfully executed by Rinal and her specialist team I am suitable impressed wit the quality of the treatment and plan as well as execution and would not hesitate recommending her in future to anyone! \nHappy New Year 2089",

I had lost all my molars and premolars and continued with this condition, since 2 decades. I was very scared to go to a dentist, specially after being a diabetic. \nI approached Dr. Rinal through a reference. She is very structured, organised, skilled lovely person. I took the decision of continuing the treatement with her in my first consultancy.\nFollowing was the procedure:\nConsultancy\nAfter a preliminary thorough oral inspection, she asked me to get a scan dent X ray. She with her team identified the problem and treatement. Then she explained me the entire process and expenses to restore my lost teeth, very patiently answering all my queries and initiated my courage to go forward.\nTreatement\nStep 1.\nFirst she got all my rudimentary molar fragments extracted painlessly, and waited for the gums to heal properly before next step.\nStep 2.\nShe did the fillings and cleaning required.after a week\nStep 3\nThen one by one they got totally 7 implants fixed in my mouth in the order\n2 lower right, 2 lower left, 2 upper left and 1 upper right, in about three to four sittings. Giving a break of one week or two weeks as the demand of healing.\nAfter all implants were installed, they checked the position by taking xrays, till they were satisfied thoroughly.\nStep 4 \nThey waited for about 6 months.\nThen they did the fixing of abutments followed by crowns. The measurements for crowns were taken accurately till they were perfect. Then they fixed the crowns matching the colour shade with my original teeth colour.\nThe whole process took a year, since i had gone to USA for family visit for about six months, before step 4.\nResult\nI got my complete set of teeth for healthy living at the age of 60. I got my confidence and smile back. No one thinks they are false teeth. They look so real. I am very comfortable and dont look my age of 60.\nAll thanks to Dr. Rinal Modi, she is an Angel and her team of Apollo dentists.\nGod Bless Her and All.\nHad it not been for Rinal, i would not have got my teeth back. I was very skeptic and nervous about the whole issue, but her reassuring and comforting methods propelled and energised me to take this final decision. And look how I am so happy now. All hugs to Dr. RINAL\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude43",
