He was able to remove even the most difficult stains and handled the entire process of cleaning and filling my teeth very gently so that the experience was almost pain free. I am extremely happy with the results and can now smile confidently. I will definitely recommend Dr. Sonawane to family and friends. Thank you Dr. Sonawane for giving me my smile back.

Moreover his approach is consultative not like other dentists which state a one way solution.secondly he ensures that one understands the problem in detail and goes that extra mile to explain the issue in depth before operating. Thirdly he is extremely co-operative and adjusting. Lastly, due to his knowledge and experience he knows how to go about the entire procedure by ensuring there is minimum / zero pain to the client & he is always available for after service as well. All of the above demonstrate that his intention is to handhold the client to give the best possible permanent solution. I would definitely recommend him for all dental surgery / cosmetic enhancement procedures.",

He was able to remove even the most difficult stains and handled the entire process of cleaning and filling my teeth very gently so that the experience was almost pain free. I am extremely happy with the results and can now smile confidently. I will definitely recommend Dr. Sonawane to family and friends. Thank you Dr. Sonawane for giving me my smile back.

Thirdly he is extremely co-operative and adjusting. Lastly, due to his knowledge and experience he knows how to go about the entire procedure by ensuring there is minimum / zero pain to the client & he is always available for after service as well. All of the above demonstrate that his intention is to handhold the client to give the best possible permanent solution. I would definitely recommend him for all dental surgery / cosmetic enhancement procedures.",
