I had severe pain and thought it's ulcers when my Dr refered me to Dr Husain (I had gum damage). He and his team identified the details and very confidently prepared me for the wisdom tooth extraction. Dentists have always been a scare for me and I am so relieved and confident with this extraction. I didn't feel a bit of pain and just pressure as the Dr had promised. He and his team did such a smooth and painless extraction of such a complicated tooth and treated my gum damage too. I just felt all my pain go away so soon instantly as soon as the extraction was done. Though I had heard about the pain after the anasthesia is gone, I didn't feel any pain the same day and throughout the entire 12 days. Just little swelling for a day which is normal and it went away with ice packs. I also flew on the 5th day and returned too. I didn't face any pain, no bleeding, no dry socket throughout.\nHe designed my medicines schedule according to my schedule.\nHe explained the after care so well.\nHe and his entire team were so careful, pleasant and responsible. Advanced instruments for imaging and treatment...\nHis cartoons on TV were an added pleasure.\nEven the stitches removal that I dreaded but I was confident that it's him so I won't feel it and the same happened. No pain at all even after the numbness is gone. It feels like nothing ever happened.\nOverall, I'm very happy with the treatment. Though it may seem expensive comparatively but I find Dr Husain and his team's work worth. I would recommend him. I am looking forward for my further treatment too.\n\nThank you Dr for the painless experience and taking my pain away and also my fear. :)\nGod bless....",

My condition was more then serious and needed immediate treatment. Finally got in touch with Dr Husain Harianawala and guess what? I am now a person with totally healthy mouth and I feel very confident about myself. And what needed was a doctor who could see us with a lot of patience, care, understanding and council in the best way since my mental state required that and doctor Husain is just perfect in handling all of that. Not to forget that the entire team is so cordial and caring with every patient. My surgeries were painless. I am overwhelmed. Would highly recommend The Dental Bond.",

I had severe pain and thought it's ulcers when my Dr refered me to Dr Husain (I had gum damage). He and his team identified the details and very confidently prepared me for the wisdom tooth extraction. Dentists have always been a scare for me and I am so relieved and confident with this extraction. I didn't feel a bit of pain and just pressure as the Dr had promised. He and his team did such a smooth and painless extraction of such a complicated tooth and treated my gum damage too. I just felt all my pain go away so soon instantly as soon as the extraction was done. Though I had heard about the pain after the anasthesia is gone, I didn't feel any pain the same day and throughout the entire 12 days. Just little swelling for a day which is normal and it went away with ice packs. I also flew on the 5th day and returned too. I didn't face any pain, no bleeding, no dry socket throughout.\nHe designed my medicines schedule according to my schedule.\nHe explained the after care so well.\nHe and his entire team were so careful, pleasant and responsible. Advanced instruments for imaging and treatment...\nHis cartoons on TV were an added pleasure.\nEven the stitches removal that I dreaded but I was confident that it's him so I won't feel it and the same happened. No pain at all even after the numbness is gone. It feels like nothing ever happened.\nOverall, I'm very happy with the treatment. Though it may seem expensive comparatively but I find Dr Husain and his team's work worth. I would recommend him. I am looking forward for my further treatment too.\n\nThank you Dr for the painless experience and taking my pain away and also my fear. :)\nGod bless....",

                "review_text": "Went around visiting like a dozen dentists but wasn\u2019t feeling right to start the procedures with any of them. My condition was more then serious and needed immediate treatment. Finally got in touch with Dr Husain Harianawala and guess what? I am now a person with totally healthy mouth and I feel very confident about myself. And what needed was a doctor who could see us with a lot of patience, care, understanding and council in the best way since my mental state required that and doctor Husain is just perfect in handling all of that. Not to forget that the entire team is so cordial and caring with every patient. My surgeries were painless. I am overwhelmed. Would highly recommend The Dental Bond.",
