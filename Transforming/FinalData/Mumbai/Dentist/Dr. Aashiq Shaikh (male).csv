"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,Dental Fillings,Dental Cavities,",0,0,YES,"Excellent service, quality and professionalism displayed by Dr Shaikh across multiple procedures and check ups.

I went to him Initially for a wisdom tooth removal, and then later for cavities.

I had cavaties which were almost going to be two root canals, other dentists were insisting on root canals even though i wasn't in pain, but Dr Aashiq explained the situation very well, spent lots of time in diagnosis and explanations and then saved me from a root canal, and instead very skillfully removed the cavity which was touching the tooth nerve. The process of filling and cosmetically re-shaping filling was done in such a way that no one can make out that anything was ever wrong with that area. 

Cavity removal and filling on two back teeth was painless and done within an hour in one single sitting.

Root canal was a difficult one, it took 3+ hours, and my case had a high risk of nerve damage, he explained the entire thing before hand along with where and how I would feel pain,  the procedure was mostly painless, with the unavoidable exception of  a few of the times that the nerve was pinched as the tooth was slowly taken out.

"Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,NO,Absolutely terrible experience. I wouldn’t recommend anyone going to Dr. Aashiq at all after the experience I’ve had. I went to him because i had severe toothache due to an unfinished root canal done by my previous dentist. I was given 2 options of either extracting the tooth or attempting a re-root canal by the dr after looking at an x-ray that he took on the spot. I asked him what he recommended and he said that he would want me to give him a chance to save the tooth and so i did and we started the procedure immediately. I was prescribed anti inflammatorys and a painkiller ******* *** to be taken 3 times a day for 5 days. These 5 days were the most painful days of my life. After this when i went back to him i had a huge hard and painful swelling on my jaw which showed that i did have infection and that I should have been prescribed antibiotics for the same. ******* ** ******** *** ********** i was recommended to do an extraction and place an implant as soon as we extract the tooth to save time. Since I didn’t want to lose my tooth i called up my family dr right after getting out of that clinic and told him the entire scenario* * *** **** **** **** ** ***** **** *** ********** **** ************* *** ****** *** **** ** ** **** ********* ****** *** ****** *********** *** * **** *** **** ** * ****** **** ** ************ It took me 3 days to recover from the pain but i still have a huge swelling filled with puss and infection. This was my experience with Dr. Aashiq and i feel the readers are smart enough to know what is best for them.,2022-11-20 00:13:37,False,False,Vedika Thadhani,"Thanks a lot for blaming us and negatively recommending us for wrong things done by your previous dentist.
Your previous doctor had broken an root canal cleaning instrument right at the apex of your tooth root while doing root canal procedure which definitely will cause you pain whether we prescribe antibiotics or not. 
We clarified this right at the time of consultation itself and gave you two options whether to extract or to give it a chance and save it. We mutually agreed to at least try and save it thinking it might work with your consent of course and explained you the possible pros and cons clearly.
What does informed consent mean?
Unfortunately your pain didn’t subside as we had expected. So as discussed at the consultation appointment the other option was the only thing left to be implemented i.e extracting the tooth.
And this is what informed consent means.
But this option didn’t go down your throat when the time arrived for it. You shouldn’t have agreed upon for it at the first appointment itself and denied any sort of treatment at our clinic if you were not ready to get the tooth removed if the first option doesn’t work.
You being a smart clever and well educated girl such a puerile behaviour was not expected at all especially after discussing each and every detail before hand.
As far as medications are concerned the doctor had cleared his stand on that day itself that until and and unless the source of infection (i.e the broken instrument) is either removed or bypassed completely or disinfected effectively the infection will recur again and again periodically ultimately transforming into a big abscess which might hurt you even more may be not today but surely some day later. This is what more than 13 years of experience of our expert doctor concludes.
Instead of thanking the doctor that he tried to save your tooth that too without even charging his fees for it, you are inappropriately recommending others not to go to him? He himself even personally messaged you the following day when the procedure was performed to know about your wellbeing. But you and your father didn’t even show any respect for the doctor. That proves your immaturity and arrogance anyhow.
We are practising in this city since 13 years and encounter a lot of good calibre and high profile cases daily so performing treatments without prior consent is not at all our preference no matter whatever the situation would be. We never ever compromise on the standards and quality for that matter and we even charge for it extra if needed. 
We have tons of patients walking in and out but None of them have ever complained such a thing in past except you in these years.


Having said that we still hope the best for you in future and pray to Almighty for your complete recovery soon 😊
