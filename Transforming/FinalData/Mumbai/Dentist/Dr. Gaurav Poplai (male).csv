"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,I am very scared from needles but at first the needle didnâ€™t hurt me at all. Due to hypo sensitivity in my teeth the root canal was feeling difficult to me until Dr Gaurav made me feel very comfortable and he was very quick at doing two rct under 1.5 hours. I would love to share his friendliness towards us & understanding the pain we can go through by making it completely painless. ,2020-09-13 13:56:18,False,True,Farheen Ali,,,
