I remembered the opening date and decided to go after its fully functioning.\n\nI just took appointment and went ahead. On the day of appointment there was call from dental clinic reminding the appointment. First good thing.\n\nSecondly when I reached there, one assistant was ready with paper pen to fill in formalities form where you write your problems and medical history.\n\nThird best thing,doctor was ready and I didn't have to wait for even a minute.\n\nOverall treatment was satisfactory as\nShe explained everything in detail\nAsked for opinions about which treatment should patient would like to go after proper explanation.\nI was impressed **** *** ********* *** ****\n\nI have changed my dental clinic.
