Ofcourse, she had a mask on, but was laughing quite often, which created a friendly and happy environment.  \nShe explained the existing dental condition, after a thorough examination. Offered alternatives for areas where applicable (eg. Use of numbing gel or local anaesthesia). Suggested alternate treatment options and explained pros and cons. Gave her decision and asked if I was ok with it, before proceeding. \nDoctor's assistant was also friendly and appeared well trained and skilled. \nTreatment was carried out very well, with well-timed 10 sec breaks to catch a breath. So the doctor seems very perceptive to patient's condition and needs. 24 hours post treatment, everything still normal - no post treatment issues.\nOverall, great value. In any case, the doctors are professionals who deserve their worth. ",

I went to the clinic only when  lockdown was partially lifted. I was having severe pain and swelling from cheek to throat. Couldn\u2019t even swallow water due to swelling.  In this condition i called Dr. Gwalani and she  prescribed medicines to let the swelling subside as I couldn\u2019t open my mouth for her to work. \n\nI will share my experience with the clinic here- \nI was skeptical in going to the clinic. But the moment you go in, they check your temperature, you have to sanitise your hands, they give you the PPE kit which includes disposable feet covers and head cap. You are supposed to wear your mask till you are on the patient seat. The staff also wears their masks and keeps the clinic disinfected. Doctors also wear their masks, gloves &  gowns.  \nAppointments are well managed so that you don\u2019t have to wait for your turn. \nDoctors are extremely polite and will explain the procedure before treating. They use state-of-art technologies to get that smile back on your face. \nDr. Gvalani is quite experienced and she knows her job well.",

Ofcourse, she had a mask on, but was laughing quite often, which created a friendly and happy environment.  \nShe explained the existing dental condition, after a thorough examination. Offered alternatives for areas where applicable (eg. Use of numbing gel or local anaesthesia). Suggested alternate treatment options and explained pros and cons. Gave her decision and asked if I was ok with it, before proceeding. \nDoctor's assistant was also friendly and appeared well trained and skilled. \nTreatment was carried out very well, with well-timed 10 sec breaks to catch a breath. So the doctor seems very perceptive to patient's condition and needs. 24 hours post treatment, everything still normal - no post treatment issues.\nOverall, great value. In any case, the doctors are professionals who deserve their worth. ",

I went to the clinic only when  lockdown was partially lifted. I was having severe pain and swelling from cheek to throat. Couldn\u2019t even swallow water due to swelling.  In this condition i called Dr. Gwalani and she  prescribed medicines to let the swelling subside as I couldn\u2019t open my mouth for her to work. \n\nI will share my experience with the clinic here- \nI was skeptical in going to the clinic. But the moment you go in, they check your temperature, you have to sanitise your hands, they give you the PPE kit which includes disposable feet covers and head cap. You are supposed to wear your mask till you are on the patient seat. The staff also wears their masks and keeps the clinic disinfected. Doctors also wear their masks, gloves &  gowns.  \nAppointments are well managed so that you don\u2019t have to wait for your turn. \nDoctors are extremely polite and will explain the procedure before treating. They use state-of-art technologies to get that smile back on your face. \nDr. Gvalani is quite experienced and she knows her job well.",
