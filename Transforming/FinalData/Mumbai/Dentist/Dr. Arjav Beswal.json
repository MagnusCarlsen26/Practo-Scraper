I'd been experiencing some sensitivity so I thought I'd get that looked at.\n\nI had no trouble getting an appointment at my preferred time. When I got to the clinic, I didn't have to wait for more than 2 mins till I was called in.\n\nThe clinic was neat and tidy and seemed very kid friendly with a few toys around for kids to play with and cartoons running on the tv, perhaps to put children at ease and in a light mood.\n\nI met Dr.Arjav and explained my problems while he listened very carefully. He inspected my teeth and agreed that it's best to get some cleaning done immediately to relieve the sensitivity. He explained the root cause of tooth sensitivity very thoroughly and patiently to me. \n\nI was expecting to get some cleaning done so I was comfortable proceeding with it. I felt that the whole process went quite smoothly and with the help of his assistant, who seemed like a young, able and hardworking dental student, ensured that I felt minimal discomfort. I must say that watching Top Gear on the tv while all this was happening certainly helped too.\n\nAt then end of it, the doctor told me about the dental hygiene routine to maintain and recommended that I get my teeth checked again a couple of months later.\n\nOverall, I was more than happy with the service and at a very affordable price point too. I'd gladly book a second appointment with Dr.Arjav Beswal. After all, that episode of Top Gear is still pending!",

I'd been experiencing some sensitivity so I thought I'd get that looked at.\n\nI had no trouble getting an appointment at my preferred time. When I got to the clinic, I didn't have to wait for more than 2 mins till I was called in.\n\nThe clinic was neat and tidy and seemed very kid friendly with a few toys around for kids to play with and cartoons running on the tv, perhaps to put children at ease and in a light mood.\n\nI met Dr.Arjav and explained my problems while he listened very carefully. He inspected my teeth and agreed that it's best to get some cleaning done immediately to relieve the sensitivity. He explained the root cause of tooth sensitivity very thoroughly and patiently to me. \n\nI was expecting to get some cleaning done so I was comfortable proceeding with it. I felt that the whole process went quite smoothly and with the help of his assistant, who seemed like a young, able and hardworking dental student, ensured that I felt minimal discomfort. I must say that watching Top Gear on the tv while all this was happening certainly helped too.\n\nAt then end of it, the doctor told me about the dental hygiene routine to maintain and recommended that I get my teeth checked again a couple of months later.\n\nOverall, I was more than happy with the service and at a very affordable price point too. I'd gladly book a second appointment with Dr.Arjav Beswal. After all, that episode of Top Gear is still pending!",
