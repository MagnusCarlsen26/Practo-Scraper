"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Teeth Whitening, Teeth cleaning & polishing,Teeth Bleaching Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Rating:- 6.5/10
Went for teeth cleaning, whitening, polishing and buffing.
Dr. Nikita is one of the best dentists i've ever visited.

She explained the entire procedure and calmed me down.
Overall vibe of the place is also good. Read a lot of reviews before going and the doctors did not disappoint when it comes to making you feel comfortable and in a safe space.
5/5 for services rendered by Dr. Nikita

However, I am not very satisfied with the end result.
Writing this review around 12 days after the procedure has been done.
Cleaning part was good. But whitening and bleaching hasn't been effective.
On a shade card, i may have gone 2-3 shades lighter. That's it. Not even close to white.

Even have some rough feeling on 2 of my teeth - including 1 pre-molar. 

Expected a better end result from the process. Not satisfied. I don't even know the next steps now.
1.5/5 for the result.

Would appreciate if someone can call me up from the clinic and advice on what can be done to make the situation better.
