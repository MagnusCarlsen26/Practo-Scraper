He gave me medicines for 3 days but I was feeling good after 2 days only. He would not rush even if other patients are waiting. He gives all the time required for the patient to feel comfortable. His treatment is the best as compared to all the dentists I have met till date. After this, I also did my teeth cleaning from him which was again a very good experience. 

My mother got her dentures done from him. He explained the process in detail initially which not all doctors do in so much of detail. He then successfully completed the treatment as per the plan given by him. The dentures are fitted very nicely and my mother has no pain. He does regular follow up to ask about any other pain / skin issues that happens due to the dentures. He tells us to visit him and not bear any pain. His patients don't have to wait because he always reaches his clinic before the appointment time. 

Seeing this, even my bua went to her for her dentures which were not fixing properly (given and prepared by other dentist). And even she is happy with his treatment and with the way he treats his patients.
