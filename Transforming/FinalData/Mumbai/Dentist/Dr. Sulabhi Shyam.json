She will have to do an uproot in one tooth and the adjacent tooth can be saved through a single sitting root canal therapy and then she will insert an bridge prosthetic. In the first appointment she did an uproot and i didn't feel any kind of pain or discomfort. She has given me the next appointment after 15 days.
