She looked at my teeth carefully and explained everything very clearly. She said we didn't need to do the second root canal, which was a relief. Instead, she filled the tooth, which was a simpler option. She cared about what was best for me, and I'm glad I chose her for my treatment. Her genuine concern for my well-being and her honesty truly impressed me.",

Instead, she filled the tooth, which was a simpler option. She cared about what was best for me, and I'm glad I chose her for my treatment. Her genuine concern for my well-being and her honesty truly impressed me.",
