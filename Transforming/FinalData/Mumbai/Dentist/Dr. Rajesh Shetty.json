My surgery was absolutely painless and felt like it was completed just in a blink. I no longer fear any dental treatments and never thought a surgery could be this painless, not even the anesthesia needle prick gave me any pain. The team of doctors are very helpful even for the care needed post the treatment, i\u2019m very satisfied and happy. I could forever rely on Dazzle for all my dental worries, and would absolutely recommend anyone who wants to get the best painless dental treatments done. In my experience so far,  this is the best dental clinic you will see in our country.",

The best part was that he addressed the problems which I was facing and did not try to add on anything extra into the treatment.\nAll the scans and x-rays were done on the same day for the Doctor's perusal.\nWithin a day I received a call from the Doctor wherein he gave a detailed insight about how they were planning on going ahead with the procedure and the estimate on the cost involved.\nSince it was a surgical procedure, involving extraction of all 4 wisdom teeth and previously affixed titanium plates (i had undergone an orthognathic surgery a few years ago) i was given a detailed overview of the same. \nIn fact the Doctor was kind enough to let me choose between General Anaesthesia or Local Anesthesia depending on my preference.\nOnce the day of the surgery was decided, i received  confirmatory calls/messages from the clinic.\nOn the day of the surgery, the Doctor was very reassuring and ensured that I was comfortable, especially since I had opted for the procedure to carried out under LA.\nDuring the entire surgery the Dr. checked on me to ensure that there was no pain and that I was at ease throughout.\nAfter the surgery all the post-surgical precautionary instructions and necessary prescriptions were given. \nI received messages/calls immediately the next day from the clinic inquiring about my well being.\nThe Doctor also called me for a follow up to check on how the healing and recovery was happening.\nThe reason I have been so descriptive is because of the extremely positive and professional experience that I have had throughout my treatment.\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Shetty and Dazzle Dental and i am happy to have a dentist who really cares and ensures that dental treatment is not all that scary that it seems to be.\nKeep up the amazing work Dazzle Dental!\nCheers!\n",

Right from consultation - identification of problems - possible solutions - and the execution, he takes enough time to explain what steps he is taking, and is very diligent at his craft. If you\u2019re looking for someone who can be trusted blindly for their skill as well as aesthetic vision, he is the man! I was very impressed on a few occasions where he refused to rush the procedure due to paucity of time, and suggested I come back again so that he can do justice to his work. I\u2019d happily oblige ! \nI had a bad experience with a tooth extraction as a kid, and I vowed to never go back to any dentist ever again. Dr Shetty was the first doctor I saw after all these years - and it is safe to say my fear is gone. My experience was never uncomfortable- am happy with my results as well. It only adds to the package that the doctor and staff are very polite and pleasant to interact with, the clinic is super clean, and one immediately feels at ease. Also, a special thanks to the doctor for making adjustments as I\u2019d frequently run late - and always make room for me in his schedule. Highly recommended! ",

Dr. Rajesh Shetty gave me a comprehensive  diagnostic evaluation of my molar  with X-rays and CT scans which I was thankful for as CT scans are usually not done in LA  due to insurance limitations. His expertise and communication skills are truly remarkable. In addition ,his whole team is well trained and  comply with U.S dental protocols and do not pressure patients to get unnecessary treatments. Thank you for your all-around caring, and compassionate care. ",

Due to it being an urgent issue he was kind enough to take my case immediately and fixed my chipped tooth in a couple of hours. It literally looks like  nothing ever happened! He was phenomenally patient, kind and considerate. He explained every aspect of the procedure before we undertook it and during the procedure he would explain what he was doing as well. He was calm and constantly checked with me as to whether I was alright. He clearly wanted the experience to be painless and comfortable. I was truly in safe hands and he definitely brought a dazzle to my smile!",

My surgery was absolutely painless and felt like it was completed just in a blink. I no longer fear any dental treatments and never thought a surgery could be this painless, not even the anesthesia needle prick gave me any pain. The team of doctors are very helpful even for the care needed post the treatment, i\u2019m very satisfied and happy. I could forever rely on Dazzle for all my dental worries, and would absolutely recommend anyone who wants to get the best painless dental treatments done. In my experience so far,  this is the best dental clinic you will see in our country.",

The best part was that he addressed the problems which I was facing and did not try to add on anything extra into the treatment.\nAll the scans and x-rays were done on the same day for the Doctor's perusal.\nWithin a day I received a call from the Doctor wherein he gave a detailed insight about how they were planning on going ahead with the procedure and the estimate on the cost involved.\nSince it was a surgical procedure, involving extraction of all 4 wisdom teeth and previously affixed titanium plates (i had undergone an orthognathic surgery a few years ago) i was given a detailed overview of the same. \nIn fact the Doctor was kind enough to let me choose between General Anaesthesia or Local Anesthesia depending on my preference.\nOnce the day of the surgery was decided, i received  confirmatory calls/messages from the clinic.\nOn the day of the surgery, the Doctor was very reassuring and ensured that I was comfortable, especially since I had opted for the procedure to carried out under LA.\nDuring the entire surgery the Dr. checked on me to ensure that there was no pain and that I was at ease throughout.\nAfter the surgery all the post-surgical precautionary instructions and necessary prescriptions were given. \nI received messages/calls immediately the next day from the clinic inquiring about my well being.\nThe Doctor also called me for a follow up to check on how the healing and recovery was happening.\nThe reason I have been so descriptive is because of the extremely positive and professional experience that I have had throughout my treatment.\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Shetty and Dazzle Dental and i am happy to have a dentist who really cares and ensures that dental treatment is not all that scary that it seems to be.\nKeep up the amazing work Dazzle Dental!\nCheers!\n",

Right from consultation - identification of problems - possible solutions - and the execution, he takes enough time to explain what steps he is taking, and is very diligent at his craft. If you\u2019re looking for someone who can be trusted blindly for their skill as well as aesthetic vision, he is the man! I was very impressed on a few occasions where he refused to rush the procedure due to paucity of time, and suggested I come back again so that he can do justice to his work. I\u2019d happily oblige ! \nI had a bad experience with a tooth extraction as a kid, and I vowed to never go back to any dentist ever again. Dr Shetty was the first doctor I saw after all these years - and it is safe to say my fear is gone. My experience was never uncomfortable- am happy with my results as well. It only adds to the package that the doctor and staff are very polite and pleasant to interact with, the clinic is super clean, and one immediately feels at ease. Also, a special thanks to the doctor for making adjustments as I\u2019d frequently run late - and always make room for me in his schedule. Highly recommended! ",

Dr. Rajesh Shetty gave me a comprehensive  diagnostic evaluation of my molar  with X-rays and CT scans which I was thankful for as CT scans are usually not done in LA  due to insurance limitations. His expertise and communication skills are truly remarkable. In addition ,his whole team is well trained and  comply with U.S dental protocols and do not pressure patients to get unnecessary treatments. Thank you for your all-around caring, and compassionate care. ",

He was phenomenally patient, kind and considerate. He explained every aspect of the procedure before we undertook it and during the procedure he would explain what he was doing as well. He was calm and constantly checked with me as to whether I was alright. He clearly wanted the experience to be painless and comfortable. I was truly in safe hands and he definitely brought a dazzle to my smile!",

Additionally, it was such a pleasure to deal with Dr Rajesh and his staff and I would recommend this dental practice to anyone.

He and his team were extremely good, warm, patient and calm. He promptly studied and discussed the issue with us and explained everything in detail before every procedure. He gave expert post surgery tips which were very helpful for recovery and also followed up to check if everythings fine. The clinic is so clean, hygenic and up to date wid the facilities.

Dr. Rajesh Shetty is humble, kind, took great care throughout all the procedures that were done in multiple sittings. Not only did he explain what was being done during the course of the sittings but also gave a clear picture of all the possibilities available for the dental issues that I consulted him for. What I like is the transparency and the unbiased solution/pathway options. He laid it all out and gave me the choice to pick how I would like to go about things. Dr. also answered all questions I had to be able to make the choice. There was transparency even with the costing.\n\nThe clinic is top-notch, well maintained and clean. Staff is cordial. All in all very impressed. Thank You so much Dr. Rajesh and team!!",

With a wisdom tooth extraction, my friends have had 10-15 days of pain and my healing process was done in 3-4 days! He also checked in on me a couple of times to make sure my after care was going as planned and was very responsive to all my concerns. Thanks for a great experience! ",

The hygiene and cleanliness levels are second to none and can be compared to European or American standards. All in all an extremely pleasant experience and I will not hesitate to go back to Dazzle for any dental issues that I may face in the future.  \nDr. Shetty is always there on watsapp for any support or assistance in case of any discomfort faced during the day or night.

I got regular follow up messages to check how I was doing, and Dr. Shetty patiently explained and discussed every step of the process and guided me through a sequence of visits and procedures that spanned several months. He and his team have done an excellent job. I would highly recommend them for your dental treatment needs. Thank you Doc Shetty and Team Dazzle for an outstanding job and great customer engagement!",

In my case one of the teeth was constantly bothering me for quite sometime and was in a fairly complex \ncondition which is why I was reluctant to get it done under local anaesthesia so I consulted Dr. Shetty and  postulated all my pre surgery concerns, not only he explained the procedure patiently to me but he also resolved my nervousness about this newly introduced I V Sedation procedure which I guess is relatively unheard & uncommon in India. After comprehending everything I went ahead for the surgery which was absolutely painless & stress free. The procedure went smooth without giving any discomfort to me.  I am relieved from the constant botheration I had in my tooth and really happy  with Dr. Shetty\u2019s expertise. Grateful to you Dr. Shetty for giving me an anxiety free & a relaxed procedure. Thank you. God bless!!",

After years of over- brushing and other mistakes my teeth and gums were in utter disarray.  The entire Dazzle staff is sweetly professional and the calmingly-gorgeous office was a wonderful place to be whilst undergoing such delicate and precise procedures.  Step-by-step I was well informed and always comfortable.  Being cared for as comprehensively and attentively as I was is unusual these days and I couldn't be happier with the results.   With profound gratitude I very much look forward to returning in a few months to continue my program.",

They use advanced technology and coupled with the expertise,  you just know that your problem is being taken care if and for good! \n\nThe experience makes you feel extremely comfortable with treatment, and the clinic has french windows beautifully surrounded by trees. So anytime in the midst of the treatment u open ur eyes or if u have to sit through the treatment, you feel as if u r at a holiday home gazing out lazily at the woods. \n\nIt is the most perfect combination of skills, expertise, technology, awesome service delivery - i have ever come across.
