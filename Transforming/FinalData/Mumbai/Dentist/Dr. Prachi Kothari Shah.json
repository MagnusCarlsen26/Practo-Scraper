I couldn't have imagined such a set up in Mumbai. \n\nThe spaciousness, hygiene, and privacy, and the state of the art tools all readily available in house, made a big difference to my experience, even compared to clinics in the US. \n\nHaving parking for patients in the vast compound itself is a big plus. \n\nThe procedure was quite reasonably priced compared to some other options in Mumbai. The doctor did only what was absolutely necessary, and left me with good advice to keep my teeth naturally healthy.  \n\nMost of all, the doctor's skill and communication kept me completely at ease throughout the procedure. It was a surprisingly painless experience! \n\nThe doctor is approachable and kind. I highly recommend!",

I couldn't have imagined such a set up in Mumbai. \n\nThe spaciousness, hygiene, and privacy, and the state of the art tools all readily available in house, made a big difference to my experience, even compared to clinics in the US. \n\nHaving parking for patients in the vast compound itself is a big plus. \n\nThe procedure was quite reasonably priced compared to some other options in Mumbai. The doctor did only what was absolutely necessary, and left me with good advice to keep my teeth naturally healthy.  \n\nMost of all, the doctor's skill and communication kept me completely at ease throughout the procedure. It was a surprisingly painless experience! \n\nThe doctor is approachable and kind. I highly recommend!",
