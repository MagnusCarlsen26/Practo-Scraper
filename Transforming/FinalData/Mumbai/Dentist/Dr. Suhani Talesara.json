I was lookng for somebody who can b good at showing results as against jus speakin and consulting and somebody who can provide me with complete oral care treatments. That\\u2019s how I came across an advert on facebook abt Dr. Dentist Multispeciality Dental Clinic. The highlight of it seemed convenient and closr to our place. I wanted to repair my crown which the last dentist had ruined. They did not fix the crown properly it also lookd very artificial as compard to other teeth. The dentist here assured me a fixture to dis and I felt lik believing in them. My desperation made me say yes and the dentists took complete charge of my problem. They not only guided me thru the treatment bt also explained every step involved. The dentist also showed some animated videos of the procedures involvd in the treatment. In approx. two seating\\u2019s my treatment was completed. The crowned teeth look quite real now. Post treatment the dentist also advised steps on how to maintain complete oral health by effective brushing and flossing. Its almst 6 months post the treatment and the tooth feels happy. Thanks. \\",

But just for you to note , as per what you told us, the Crown came out once which ideally you should have come and shown us once but you didn\u2019t and you rather chose to wear the loose crown on the tooth which is an incorrect practice. Crown usually comes off only if there is a slight high point on it which a patient realises only once he starts biting from that side, on examination if we find the high point, we reduce it and re fix  the same. It\u2019s not the treatment that went wrong, it\u2019s your perception that is making you feel so. As far as the fee is concerned, we haven\u2019t charged you any repeat fee yet. Still suggest you come and show it once if possible. We will re fix it.",

But before the implants procedure they mentioned firstly to get minor bone grafting done as my jawbone wasn\u2019t thick enough to support the implants. He further explained to me that bone grafting was very important to control the pressure exerted while I\u2019ll chew my food, hence, if the bone is not strong enough to hold on the support of the implants the whole procedure will completely fail worsening my oral condition even more. I agreed to get the bone grafting done only after the assurance from my dentist to give absolute painless as I was already undergoing dental anxiety. And as assured the grafting procedure was very comfortable and painless and the dentists has asked me come back to the clinic after 4-5 months once the grafting is adjusted properly in the mouth and are ready to hold implants. The dentists had prescribed with pain relief medicines and some antibiotics to avoid infections. Now I m very much looking forward towards getting my dental implants as well.",

She was friendly and after examining my tooth, she said tht I have to undergo a root canal and she even gave me time to think about it. I was sceptical since my husband had not so pleasant experiences with 3 dentists here. I had no other choice than listening to her since my pain was getting worsened. I was totally nervous and she could see that from my face. But the way she counseled me had such an impact on me that I totally trusted her and surrounded myself to her. My threshold to pain is minimal, but she handled me with great patience and even consoled me. She followed up about my tooth after each sitting (even when she was on vacation). She even gave proper guidance as to how to take care of my tooth post root canal. She is available anytime of the day or night and gives quick response to patients' query. She is honest and gives proper calculations about her charges without any hidden costs. I never got any family dentist here in Mumbai, but now I have her as one. Even my husband is planning to visit her for his wisdom tooth case (it's been months together that he found out the problem but never got a trusted dentist to operate it). We are glad that we found her.",

I was lookng for somebody who can b good at showing results as against jus speakin and consulting and somebody who can provide me with complete oral care treatments. That\\u2019s how I came across an advert on facebook abt Dr. Dentist Multispeciality Dental Clinic. The highlight of it seemed convenient and closr to our place. I wanted to repair my crown which the last dentist had ruined. They did not fix the crown properly it also lookd very artificial as compard to other teeth. The dentist here assured me a fixture to dis and I felt lik believing in them. My desperation made me say yes and the dentists took complete charge of my problem. They not only guided me thru the treatment bt also explained every step involved. The dentist also showed some animated videos of the procedures involvd in the treatment. In approx. two seating\\u2019s my treatment was completed. The crowned teeth look quite real now. Post treatment the dentist also advised steps on how to maintain complete oral health by effective brushing and flossing. Its almst 6 months post the treatment and the tooth feels happy. Thanks. \\",

But just for you to note , as per what you told us, the Crown came out once which ideally you should have come and shown us once but you didn\u2019t and you rather chose to wear the loose crown on the tooth which is an incorrect practice. Crown usually comes off only if there is a slight high point on it which a patient realises only once he starts biting from that side, on examination if we find the high point, we reduce it and re fix  the same. It\u2019s not the treatment that went wrong, it\u2019s your perception that is making you feel so. As far as the fee is concerned, we haven\u2019t charged you any repeat fee yet. Still suggest you come and show it once if possible. We will re fix it.",

He further explained to me that bone grafting was very important to control the pressure exerted while I\u2019ll chew my food, hence, if the bone is not strong enough to hold on the support of the implants the whole procedure will completely fail worsening my oral condition even more. I agreed to get the bone grafting done only after the assurance from my dentist to give absolute painless as I was already undergoing dental anxiety. And as assured the grafting procedure was very comfortable and painless and the dentists has asked me come back to the clinic after 4-5 months once the grafting is adjusted properly in the mouth and are ready to hold implants. The dentists had prescribed with pain relief medicines and some antibiotics to avoid infections. Now I m very much looking forward towards getting my dental implants as well.",

She was friendly and after examining my tooth, she said tht I have to undergo a root canal and she even gave me time to think about it. I was sceptical since my husband had not so pleasant experiences with 3 dentists here. I had no other choice than listening to her since my pain was getting worsened. I was totally nervous and she could see that from my face. But the way she counseled me had such an impact on me that I totally trusted her and surrounded myself to her. My threshold to pain is minimal, but she handled me with great patience and even consoled me. She followed up about my tooth after each sitting (even when she was on vacation). She even gave proper guidance as to how to take care of my tooth post root canal. She is available anytime of the day or night and gives quick response to patients' query. She is honest and gives proper calculations about her charges without any hidden costs. I never got any family dentist here in Mumbai, but now I have her as one. Even my husband is planning to visit her for his wisdom tooth case (it's been months together that he found out the problem but never got a trusted dentist to operate it). We are glad that we found her.",

When we visited again after a year with this issue, Dr. Suhani promptly agreed to re-do both the root canals free of cost. Had we gone to any other dentist they would have charged us a hefty amount for both the root canals. \n\nBoth the root canals were successful and my mom is free from any pain. Dr. Suhani was very welcoming and it showed that patient satisfaction was her top priority.\n\nOh and she's got a great playlist that she puts on during procedure! \nHighly recommended !!!",

Its very difficult to get kids agree to any tooth job,  keep sitting stable with their mouths open,  but doctor Suhani could get my kids to do so with so much ease.  What started as a trial visit  has turned into family dental doctor.  As kids love chocolates, visits to dr are multiple times in a year,  but i m not complaining...  Keep up the good work... ",

She made me realise how not to depend on Google but consult with the doctor first. 2) She explained me in detail about the pre and post session  procedure about the extraction. 3)  Extraction done without any pain. 4) Dr. Suhani is very nice and informative. 5) Thank you so much for the excellent dental care and I will be coming here for all my future dental problems \ud83d\ude01",

She even played some light music to calm down my mother who was afraid of pain! \n\n2. Covid norms were duly followed. Both the doctor and her assistant were wearing masks, gloves and PPE kits. \n\n3. The clinic was clean and well maintained. \n\nThe RCT was successful and both my parents are now free of tooth pain. Treatment cost was very reasonable.\n\n We would highly recommend Dr. Suhani to anyone who is facing any dental issues. ",
