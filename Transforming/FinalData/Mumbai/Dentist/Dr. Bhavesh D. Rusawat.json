The clinic was state-of-the-art and had vibrant colored rooms. It has separate rooms for different functionalities. In short it had all the facilities in one clinic. I need not wait at the reception and was taken into treatment at the same time as I had appointment. The treatment was painless. I had filling done in my teeth. Now after few days I can eat anything hot and cold without any pain in my tooth. I would surely recommend Vibgyor dental clinic to my family members,peers and friends.",

And very reasonable price.  Thank you practo and I would like to thank the doc too for a wonderful job.  Even the prescription he wrote the tablets wasn't so bitter as expected.  One them painkiller tasted like candy. Blessed be doc bhavesh. Wish to have more docs like him.  Awesome person to be too good as a doc. Bless up bhavesh",

Before visiting the clinic I had word with Dr. Bhavesh Rusawat on phone. He was very cordial in his approach. When I visited the clinic I was awestruck by the look of it. The clinic was state-of-the-art and had vibrant colored rooms. It has separate rooms for different functionalities. In short it had all the facilities in one clinic. I need not wait at the reception and was taken into treatment at the same time as I had appointment. The treatment was painless. I had filling done in my teeth. Now after few days I can eat anything hot and cold without any pain in my tooth. I would surely recommend Vibgyor dental clinic to my family members,peers and friends.",

Everything wentso smooth . Even before I opened my eyes I got rid of my rotten wisdom tooth. I recommend him to everyone who is reading this comment.  I also suggest your kids would love him too and the doc bhavesh loves kids , he is very gentle and very gentle during the surgery.  I was in paradise during the treatment lol.  And very reasonable price.  Thank you practo and I would like to thank the doc too for a wonderful job.  Even the prescription he wrote the tablets wasn't so bitter as expected.  One them painkiller tasted like candy. Blessed be doc bhavesh. Wish to have more docs like him.  Awesome person to be too good as a doc. Bless up bhavesh",
