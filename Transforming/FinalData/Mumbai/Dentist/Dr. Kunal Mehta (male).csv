Is very rude and arrogant with patients. ",2022-04-29 14:02:35,False,False,Verified Patient,"We Appreciate All Feedback As it Helps Us Improve.

But Certain Facts In the above feedback are misrepresented hence would like to clarify.

We do give a fixed quotation however in this particular case the patients canals were blocked with pulp stones which are not visible on the x-ray and can only be recognised once we start treatment. 

So A two session treatment went for six session along with super specialist intervention for which an additional cost of 1000 was told in the second last session to the patient.

The Patients Spouse instead of understanding the case and rather that such complicated was treated successfully started arguing with the drs . On hearing the patient side the additional charge was waived off and the exact amount quoted was charged .

Hence instead of appreciation of managing such a complicated case we have been given such feedback that too over charges which weren't even paid.
