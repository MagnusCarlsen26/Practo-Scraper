But Dr did not have time becoz of his other booking, some how the small filling was pushed to last 4 days of me in Mumbai.\n \nOn the day on small filing Dr. Bajaj removed the old filling and put temporary filling and ask me come back after 2 days for final filling, on the final filling day which was my second last day in Mumbai he inspected the tooth and asked his assistant to complete the filling.\n \nAnd now the trouble started, she I think is not trained and did not knew what she was doing and could not remove the temporary filling and two times she did something that caused lot of pain to me.  At the end Dr. bajaj had to come back to finish the teeth, but damage was done.\n \nThe tooth had started paining after treatment which was not happening before, I went to the clinic next day as I was flying aboard the day after, the assistant and all the helper where relaxing in the clinic and atmosphere was not at all professional as Dr. Bajaj was not in the clinic, she said let me take the Xray and then said Oh! this is root canal, so I am thinking why did you not take this Xray yesterday and check what you have done.  utterly unprofessional. Till date the tooth is hurting me and I cannot get the treatment done as I am aboard for next 5 months.\n \nNow I am back to square one where I was in July, this is after spending 25000 rupees and 7 visits.\n \nCons: 1) donu2019t get any treatment done by the assistantu2019s.\n2) Slow treatment plan\n3) very expensive\n     \nPros: Dr. Bajaj is very good in what he is doing\n2) material used are of good quality\n \n\nI should be entitle for some refund for messing up the tooth.",

After joining the course I developed a sporadic pain in tooth. I did not pay much attention to it. During a short vacation I went back to my home in Kolkata and gave a send thought to it and visited a dentist. He advised me to go for root canal. He said it will take 2 appointments but a duration of 1 week in between. Then I searched in internet for a dentist in around West Andheri. Practo topped the search mainly because it was the most searched or visited portal in this space. However, I went through couple of reviews and got convinced that this was exactly the dental clinic that I was looking for. Mostly it was because of the reviews about Dr. Ajay Bajaj. His vast  experience in this domain,various patient's experience (through reviews in the site) in undergoing painless RC treatment and other major treatments in dental space carried by him made me believe that I should take the appointment right away. My main intention was not only to have a painless experience while undergoing RC but to have a effective solution to my problems. I booked my dates and visited the clinic. I was warmly greeted by Dr. Ajaj Bajaj. Dr. Nishi Bajaj initially inspected my tooth and they both consulted and told me to got for RC. I explained my constraints (as I was suppose to travel within 2 weeks to US for a exchange program), so they to start RC proceedings immediately that evening itself. I did not expect the proceedings to happen so fast. Dr. Ajay did the RC flawlessly and truly speaking never had pain during or after the RC. Post RC, I went through couple of filling in other tooth as well. I felt both of the doctors were very experienced in their profession. They took utmost care in whatever big or small treatments they did and with perfection. Surprising to see their consulting charges was so nominal. But there were no dearth of quality services.\r\n   ",

I was referred to him when no dentists could handle my case. I had undergone a root canal but the tooth ache wouldn't subside. Dr. Bajaj evaluated my case patiently and tried to figure the issue. After several x-rays he found the root cause of my misery. My wisdom tooth was the problem, it required root canal with decay on three places. \nDr. Bajaj conducted a root canal in single sitting. It was a twisted surgery, not an easy one to handle, gladly it was successful and me had my bridge too. Before I met Dr. Bajaj I was mentally drained about my dental issue. Today after his treatment I got my Smile back. Thanks to Smilez Unlimited, they truly live up to their name. \nI would thoroughly recommend Dr. Bajaj to everyone with dental issues. He is highly professional, meticulous, well informed, well experienced and phenomenal at his work. \n ",

But Dr did not have time becoz of his other booking, some how the small filling was pushed to last 4 days of me in Mumbai.\n \nOn the day on small filing Dr. Bajaj removed the old filling and put temporary filling and ask me come back after 2 days for final filling, on the final filling day which was my second last day in Mumbai he inspected the tooth and asked his assistant to complete the filling.\n \nAnd now the trouble started, she I think is not trained and did not knew what she was doing and could not remove the temporary filling and two times she did something that caused lot of pain to me.  At the end Dr. bajaj had to come back to finish the teeth, but damage was done.\n \nThe tooth had started paining after treatment which was not happening before, I went to the clinic next day as I was flying aboard the day after, the assistant and all the helper where relaxing in the clinic and atmosphere was not at all professional as Dr. Bajaj was not in the clinic, she said let me take the Xray and then said Oh! this is root canal, so I am thinking why did you not take this Xray yesterday and check what you have done.  utterly unprofessional. Till date the tooth is hurting me and I cannot get the treatment done as I am aboard for next 5 months.\n \nNow I am back to square one where I was in July, this is after spending 25000 rupees and 7 visits.\n \nCons: 1) donu2019t get any treatment done by the assistantu2019s.\n2) Slow treatment plan\n3) very expensive\n     \nPros: Dr. Bajaj is very good in what he is doing\n2) material used are of good quality\n \n\nI should be entitle for some refund for messing up the tooth.",

After joining the course I developed a sporadic pain in tooth. I did not pay much attention to it. During a short vacation I went back to my home in Kolkata and gave a send thought to it and visited a dentist. He advised me to go for root canal. He said it will take 2 appointments but a duration of 1 week in between. Then I searched in internet for a dentist in around West Andheri. Practo topped the search mainly because it was the most searched or visited portal in this space. However, I went through couple of reviews and got convinced that this was exactly the dental clinic that I was looking for. Mostly it was because of the reviews about Dr. Ajay Bajaj. His vast  experience in this domain,various patient's experience (through reviews in the site) in undergoing painless RC treatment and other major treatments in dental space carried by him made me believe that I should take the appointment right away. My main intention was not only to have a painless experience while undergoing RC but to have a effective solution to my problems. I booked my dates and visited the clinic. I was warmly greeted by Dr. Ajaj Bajaj. Dr. Nishi Bajaj initially inspected my tooth and they both consulted and told me to got for RC. I explained my constraints (as I was suppose to travel within 2 weeks to US for a exchange program), so they to start RC proceedings immediately that evening itself. I did not expect the proceedings to happen so fast. Dr. Ajay did the RC flawlessly and truly speaking never had pain during or after the RC. Post RC, I went through couple of filling in other tooth as well. I felt both of the doctors were very experienced in their profession. They took utmost care in whatever big or small treatments they did and with perfection. Surprising to see their consulting charges was so nominal. But there were no dearth of quality services.\r\n   ",

I was referred to him when no dentists could handle my case. I had undergone a root canal but the tooth ache wouldn't subside. Dr. Bajaj evaluated my case patiently and tried to figure the issue. After several x-rays he found the root cause of my misery. My wisdom tooth was the problem, it required root canal with decay on three places. \nDr. Bajaj conducted a root canal in single sitting. It was a twisted surgery, not an easy one to handle, gladly it was successful and me had my bridge too. Before I met Dr. Bajaj I was mentally drained about my dental issue. Today after his treatment I got my Smile back. Thanks to Smilez Unlimited, they truly live up to their name. \nI would thoroughly recommend Dr. Bajaj to everyone with dental issues. He is highly professional, meticulous, well informed, well experienced and phenomenal at his work. \n ",

I owe this tooth to him.\nDr. Bajaj has a very fine and experienced hand and can handle complicated cases very confidently.

He did a thorough check and advised me to go forna root canal. Next he asked me to do a full mouth X-ray as he could see some more cavities in other teeth as well. Finally we had to do 2 root canal and 9 permanent fillings. So basically all my molars had to be treated. He explained me the procedure very well and also took a special care as I was an outstation patient and had to leave soon. Finally my all RCT and filings were done. I won't say that it didn't pain in RCT. It did pain. But it was very very very small pain. Kind of momentary pains. \nThe staff is also very friendly and helpful. So if u r a dentist phobic pay him a visit. The fear might just go away!",

You can say bye bye to your pain the moment you step into their clinic. \r\nMy husband has a rather weak dental constitution - he is 43 however his dental age can be described as that of a 70 year old. His gums were so weak that we had given up all hopes of saving his teeth - until we started treatment here. He has got a new lease of life - thanks to Dr Nishi Bajaj's advanced gum treatment which was also painless clean and non-invasive at best. With our dental care here we are both happy and SMILING :) Thank you ever so much Dr Nishi & Dr Ajay!  \r\nRegards \r\nArchana & Pratip Banerjee",

Along with him, Dr. Nishi and Dr. Mansi are also very good dentist. All of them work together as a team, for instance - Dr. Ajay would do the root canal and then Dr. Nishi would do the filling and crown measurement, throughout the process Dr. Ajay is present and they discuss the issue, if needed.  In short, a very helpful and proficient dentist. I would wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone facing any sort of dental problem.",

For medical treatment one can not say that it is an awesome experience as ultimately it takes a toll on one's health but all I could say is that both, Dr Ajay and Dr Nishi Bajaj,  are wonderful dentists. I was and still am a nervous patient hence before meeting Dr Ajay Bajaj, I used to avoid dental treatments but that is not the case now.  The Staff is good, dentists are extremely co-operative and thorough professionals.  The experience of getting dental treatments done at Smilez Clinic has always been great.  \r\nToday's patients are qualified  and they expect the doctors to explain their problems to them before planning the line of treatment.  Doctors at Smilez Clinic not only discuss the problems with patients but they also live up to patients' expectations. Thanks to all of you for all the help.  Thanks to my cousin, Dr Ajit Gandhi,  for introducing me to Dr Ajay Bajaj. ",

His advice on treatment encompasses not only the short term benefits but the long term advantages that the patient stands to gain over a period of time. I am very pleased with the treatment I have received at Smilez Unlimited and would recommend other members of my family. I strongly encourage the younger doctors who have graduated from the universities to adapt similar professional approach as Dr Bajaj and continue to serve the society with the same enthusiasm. ",
