I\u2019m a root canal specialist and believe in saving teeth but not just for the sake of it.. specially when I forsee you spending more time, energy and money in future on the same teeth and ultimately extracting them anyway. For me, that would be cheating. \nAnyway, you know what\u2019s best for you and we wish you all the best.",

With doctors, at least for me, a good vibe is very important. I visited her for a shaky tooth. She took a look at my teeth and told me that at least 5 extractions need to be done. She said that she will further discuss my prognosis after an X-ray. I got back to her with an X-ray and she sticks to her prognosis, which are 6 extractions, 3-4 fillings and a re-root canal which has already been root canal treated before. After all the extractions, I would need dental implants, which she said would cost me 30-35 k per tooth. So basically, I would be visiting Dr Bhumika for the next 6 months - 1 year. Agreed, perhaps my dental health isn\u2019t the greatest. But I got the feeling that her approach was quite radical. Money is one part, but the main concern here was if I really wanted to part with so many teeth, which weren\u2019t really troubling me, except for the one that was shaking. So I discussed at home with my husband and we thought I should take a second opinion. I went to another dentist and told him the situation. He, unlike Dr Bhumika, examined each and every single tooth, poked and prodded them, asked me if I am experiencing some sort of pain, took an X-ray again. He told me that he would extract that shaky tooth superficially with just an anesthetic spray. He said that there is no need to surgically remove that tooth for now as it is deeply lodged in and when it comes out and troubles me, we can think of a course of action. As far as the remaining teeth - he said I need two more extractions maximum and he will try and save one, if he can but he won\u2019t know unless he goes in. Lastly, he said I need only one filling and the tooth that has been treated with root canal only needs a crown and not a root canal again as it has been done perfectly well previously.  I am not from Bombay and I don\u2019t have a family dentist here. I rely on a platform like Practo to choose someone and I completely went with all the lovely reviews she had here. I am still not saying she\u2019s not an able dentist - just that you usually go to a dentist because your teeth is in bad shape and you want them to do everything they can to save them. For me personally, suggesting extractions straight away was extremely radical. Like the other dentist said, \u201ceven if the tooth was going to go bad in the future again, if I can save it for the next 10 years I will because you are relatively young.\u201d Yes I am 33 years old *** ** * *** **** **** ********** * ***** ** ** ***** * ***** **** * *** *** ***** ",

Given my last wisdom tooth extraction experience which was quite painful (and with a long recovery time), I was extremely scared and hesitant to get another extraction. Dr. Bhumija logically explained why the extraction was needed immediately and assured me that my experience will be painless - her confidence and calm/friendly demeanor really helped me to go ahead with the extraction. I was pleasantly surprised (read shocked) when she said that the last anesthesia shot might give me slight discomfort (it didn't) because I did not realize that I already had got the first few shots - they were painless! I remember my last experience was harrowing where I was screaming during those shots. \n\nThe overall procedure was fast and absolutely painless, unlike my prior experience in India and Spain. My recovery was super quick and I could resume work immediately. I was highly impressed by Dr. Bhumija's skillset, friendliness, warmth, and the fact she delivered on her promise of a painless experience.  Her clinic was aesthetically pleasing and her staff was super friendly.  I will not only fly down again but I will not hesitate to fly my family to Mumbai to get dental treatment from her :). Thank you so much,  savior! 100/10 experience.",

The cleaniness at the clinic is still as impeccable and support staff is warm and friendly.I visited her for an extraction and Root Canal treatment and she assured me that it would be painless, and lived upto it. The entire 90 odd min procedure was completely painfree.What I liked about the process was that she explained the issues clearly, tried her best to avoid any unnecessary procedures, asked me to not bear any pain and call it out, if I felt something and acted like a thorough professional throughout the entire process.I was a little concerned going into the procedure for the first time, but her professionalism and skillset ensured calmness and made it a wonderful experience. She also makes her available to clarify any doubts after any procedure which is much appreciated.I was happy about my decision to revisit her and would strongly recommend visiting her for any dental issues.",

Our attempt here is always to do the best for our patients and treat your teeth to the best of our abilities . After reading your feedback, I again looked at your X-ray and still cannot understand why anyone would recommend capping diseased teeth with hopeless prognosis. I\u2019m a root canal specialist and believe in saving teeth but not just for the sake of it.. specially when I forsee you spending more time, energy and money in future on the same teeth and ultimately extracting them anyway. For me, that would be cheating. \nAnyway, you know what\u2019s best for you and we wish you all the best.",

                "review_text": "Dr Bhumika is extremely kind and well spoken. Her clinic is extremely pleasant and clean. She makes a really good first impression and I got a very nice vibe from her. With doctors, at least for me, a good vibe is very important. I visited her for a shaky tooth. She took a look at my teeth and told me that at least 5 extractions need to be done. She said that she will further discuss my prognosis after an X-ray. I got back to her with an X-ray and she sticks to her prognosis, which are 6 extractions, 3-4 fillings and a re-root canal which has already been root canal treated before. After all the extractions, I would need dental implants, which she said would cost me 30-35 k per tooth. So basically, I would be visiting Dr Bhumika for the next 6 months - 1 year. Agreed, perhaps my dental health isn\u2019t the greatest. But I got the feeling that her approach was quite radical. Money is one part, but the main concern here was if I really wanted to part with so many teeth, which weren\u2019t really troubling me, except for the one that was shaking. So I discussed at home with my husband and we thought I should take a second opinion. I went to another dentist and told him the situation. He, unlike Dr Bhumika, examined each and every single tooth, poked and prodded them, asked me if I am experiencing some sort of pain, took an X-ray again. He told me that he would extract that shaky tooth superficially with just an anesthetic spray. He said that there is no need to surgically remove that tooth for now as it is deeply lodged in and when it comes out and troubles me, we can think of a course of action. As far as the remaining teeth - he said I need two more extractions maximum and he will try and save one, if he can but he won\u2019t know unless he goes in. Lastly, he said I need only one filling and the tooth that has been treated with root canal only needs a crown and not a root canal again as it has been done perfectly well previously.  I am not from Bombay and I don\u2019t have a family dentist here. I rely on a platform like Practo to choose someone and I completely went with all the lovely reviews she had here. I am still not saying she\u2019s not an able dentist - just that you usually go to a dentist because your teeth is in bad shape and you want them to do everything they can to save them. For me personally, suggesting extractions straight away was extremely radical. Like the other dentist said, \u201ceven if the tooth was going to go bad in the future again, if I can save it for the next 10 years I will because you are relatively young.\u201d Yes I am 33 years old *** ** * *** **** **** ********** * ***** ** ** ***** * ***** **** * *** *** ***** ",

Given my last wisdom tooth extraction experience which was quite painful (and with a long recovery time), I was extremely scared and hesitant to get another extraction. Dr. Bhumija logically explained why the extraction was needed immediately and assured me that my experience will be painless - her confidence and calm/friendly demeanor really helped me to go ahead with the extraction. I was pleasantly surprised (read shocked) when she said that the last anesthesia shot might give me slight discomfort (it didn't) because I did not realize that I already had got the first few shots - they were painless! I remember my last experience was harrowing where I was screaming during those shots. \n\nThe overall procedure was fast and absolutely painless, unlike my prior experience in India and Spain. My recovery was super quick and I could resume work immediately. I was highly impressed by Dr. Bhumija's skillset, friendliness, warmth, and the fact she delivered on her promise of a painless experience.  Her clinic was aesthetically pleasing and her staff was super friendly.  I will not only fly down again but I will not hesitate to fly my family to Mumbai to get dental treatment from her :). Thank you so much,  savior! 100/10 experience.",

The cleaniness at the clinic is still as impeccable and support staff is warm and friendly.I visited her for an extraction and Root Canal treatment and she assured me that it would be painless, and lived upto it. The entire 90 odd min procedure was completely painfree.What I liked about the process was that she explained the issues clearly, tried her best to avoid any unnecessary procedures, asked me to not bear any pain and call it out, if I felt something and acted like a thorough professional throughout the entire process.I was a little concerned going into the procedure for the first time, but her professionalism and skillset ensured calmness and made it a wonderful experience. She also makes her available to clarify any doubts after any procedure which is much appreciated.I was happy about my decision to revisit her and would strongly recommend visiting her for any dental issues.",

It was frustrating to keep going from door to door. But after my first visit at Dr. Nair's Clinic, I felt her consultation and diagnosis was far more thorough *** ******** compared to what I had previously received. \nThe RCT on a broken and complex tooth condition required several visits including a gum surgery and to Dr. Bhumija's credit, she has been as thorough, sincere and consistent with her brilliance through the month and a half long treatment which is now complete. She was so patient through the whole process, never once rushing to complete the treatment. Further, to top it all, both the temporary and permanent crowns fit perfectly in the first try itself! I don't think you will come across anyone more sincere out there. Dr. Nair proceeds with a one pointed focus, and that is to make sure you get what is absolutely the very best for you. So if you don't need an extraction, be rest assured she will save your tooth! And if your tooth and gums need time to heal before the next stage of your treatment Dr. Bhumija will ensure that everyone sits back so the healing can take place. Cheers to you Doc! You are a Diamond in the haystack! Thankyou for everything:)",

However, the image and fear which I have for a Dentist in my mind (coz of my past experience) was the main reason coz of which I haven't visited any dentist to get rid of the paid. But when the pain became unbearable I had no other option but to search for one via of course internet. I must say that I was lucky enough to get her number on google. \r\nThey understood the urgency and gave me immediate appointment. In one appointment within 10 minutes exact problem was explained to me in a layman language so that a patient can understand the same quickly. Second appointment was for removal of wisdom too affected with cavity and everything went well. Next appointment's were for cleaning and polishing teeth. I must say one thing, these guys are very punctual which is the main thing for a working professional like us. All the time I visited her clinic between office timing and the process was completed within due period of time. The staff is also very polite and ask for water the moment you enter the clinic.\r\nI'll recommend Dr Bhumija to everyone if you need a doctor with proper solution and polite personality that too with punctuality. \r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n",

She understands the fear and anxiety that people come to dentist with and starts her treatment there. She makes you comfortable enough and informs you of all procedures very systematically. She encourages questions and answers till you understand them. I have had a lot of dental issues and I have met dentists who looked at me like I'm a gold mine or are least bothered to address my fears about the procedures. But Dr. Bhumija is amazing. She genuinely cares about you. I have done everything from cleaning to fillings to root canals to re root canal to gum surgery to extraction. And every procedure was almost painless and comfortable. She is also very open to feedback. \n\nMoreover I had a time frame to work with as I was moving to the US. She finished my treatments on time, structured my appointments well. She values your time and is very accommodating. \n\nHer clinic is clean and nice. What more? She has a fantastic taste in music. She puts up instrumentals of rock song and pop songs and I once heard a cello cover of the Game of Thrones. Brownie points because she likes Lana Del Rey who is my absolute favorite. She played it once on request when we were doing a difficult procedure to help me relax. Guessing which song is playing is a great past time while treatment is in progress. There also some cute and pun-ny comic to keep fear at bay.\n\nOverall, wonderful service and great treatment provided which is on par with the new technological advances. I will totally recommend going to her!",

I found her on Practo and I am very happy that I chose her.\r\n\r\nI visited her for Root Canal Treatment of 2nd molar, Wisdom tooth extraction, Crown fixing and teeth cleaning. She explained every treatment process to me in detail and answered all my queries. *** ** ** ****** *** *** ********** **** ** **** ******* In the starting, I was afraid that whole treatment would be very painful but she took great care of me. Throughout the whole treatment process, she always ensured that I am not feeling any pain.\r\n\r\nI was a difficult patient to handle as I have a bad gag reflex. Sometimes she had to start the treatment process again, but she never lost her calm and made sure that I am feeling comfortable. This quality of her is what I liked the most.\r\n\r\nShe is very punctual and this is very important to me as I am working professional and had to leave for office just after treatment. Her staff is also very polite.\r\n\r\nHer clinic is very clean and good looking. Moreover, I liked the music she plays during treatment. It helps keeping your mind off of the drilling going on in your tooth.\r**** ** *** **** * ***** ****** *** * ***** ***** ***** **** She is very cool and professional. I definitely recommend her to everyone.\r\n\r\nP.S.- Don\u2019t miss the lovely painting at reception when you visit her :).",

So far during the treatment, not once have I felt any pain and discomfort. At first I found the treatment expensive but the kind of expertise Dr. Bhumija has and the way she treats her patients, it's all worth it. Throughout the treatment she played calm music and kept giving me breaks in between the treatment as I had a difficult treatment to be done. Today I'm filled with immense gratitude for the painless treatment, kindness and the patience Dr. Bhoomija has shown. I hope to visit her for further treatments. I highly recommend Dr. Bhoomija for all kinds of dental treatments and assure you that there would be no pain in any treatment an individual would go through at her clinic. ",

She talked to me throughout the treatment making sure I didn't feel uncomfortable even for a second.  No pain or discomfort btw...\n\nHer suggestions post the treatment further eased my nerves as I felt I was being looked after. \nConsider following her Instagram account dedicated to oral health - dentistry_by_dr.bhumija\n\nExtremely pleasant experience at her clinic. Highly recommended!",

At the right time she felt that the treatment was causing some pain so she recommended local anesthesia. That helped a lot. Post the treatment she took an XRay to confirm the exactness of the procedure. The treatment took nearly an hour and she kept checking if I am comfortable and can she go on. I would definitely go to her again given her high degree of skill, professionalism and empathy. ",

But then I came across Dr. Nair's Clinic through Practo, just opposite my residence. There I met the dentist Dr. Bhumija Nair. She took the time to explain the issues I had and then she explained me the procedure she is going to do. Everything went very well, post which I was at little ease and less worried. Not only that, she goes above and beyond the call of duty, she did keep a check if I'm having any issues post surgery. I found her to be excellent, very Professional as well as truly caring. Thank you Dr. Bhumija Nair for the great experience and quality work you have done. Now I'm pretty sure about getting my other treatments done at Dr. Nair's clinic only. ",

While other dentists told me that 2 RCTs would be required, she managed to complete the treatment with just 1 RCT which was painless. She gave a lot of tips on dental care and maintenance. The cost was also very reasonable.The wait time is also very less as she manages her calendar and appointments very well unlike a lot of doctors. \n\nA really focused doc and she clearly loves her profession.

Dr. Bhumija Nair explained what exactly was wrong with my teeth and how she intended to treat it. She explained the course of action and asked me whether I was okay with it. She was quick, kept her time, and managed to maintain a balance between being friendly and a thorough professional. Apart from that, she also explained what each prescribed medicine does. Interacting with dentists is not a very pleasant thing to begin with but Dr. Nair somehow managed to relax me to the point that I am not nervous about the treatment anymore.

She\u2019s  like an artist performing the procedures effortlessly . I cannot thank her enough for fixing my numerous dental issues.

Went to her with excruciating pain in one of my teeth. She did an X-Ray and explained that I would need a RCT. Since, I had an infection, she generously did it over two seatings, so that the process is painless. In the beginning, I was a little wary of the process, but Dr. Bhumija made sure I was comfortable and relaxed with her step by step explanation, conversations and of course the music. Overall, the  treatment was smooth and painless. But what made the experience better is her politeness and humour. Special mention, all the memes. ",

As painful as it sounds, I was surprised to undergo the whole treatment without any pain. ( just mild discomfort which is natural)I really appreciate that the clinic is so well equipped with latest technology, there's always a follow up call before the appointments, and recently when I visited the clinic during the pandemic, proper safety measures were taken to ensure my safety as well as the safety of the other patients and the staff.Being scared of going to the dentist since childhood, I'm happy and thankful that I found someone like Dr. Bhumija Nair.

But Dr Bhumija made the whole procedure so comfortable.\nShe talked me through the whole process in advance and didnt over prescribe anything.\nI also got a complementary teeth cleaning \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\nThe clinic is neat and clean and the equipment is new.

But after suffering from a lot of pain and infection, I finally decided to find a good dentist in Mumbai, which I hadn't found till I met Dr.Bhumija Nair. She deserves every praise that's written for her and more. She gave honest suggestions on the treatment procedure & ensured that I don't need extractions as any other dentist would suggest. I was surprised to know my wisdom teeth have erupted & with a little procedure the infection can be cured forever. She also answered all my queries patienly and honestly. She is excellent & I totally recommend her. Thanks Doctor \ud83d\ude42  ",

As a doctor, she is greatly invested in her work and actually cares about her patients. She knows her skill and you will get the best results. \n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Bhumija. ",

I too enjoyed the talks they both were having.\r\nWithout any pain Dr. cleaned the cavity with bit of scrapping and drilling....while my daughter watched Mickey Mouse.\r\nI really liked the way Dr. Bhumija took care of my daughter during the process.

Finally I and my husband checked online and read good reviews about Dr Nair. The best part was I was particularly looking for lady Dr only for my treatment. And I was happy to hear that surgeon too was lady. I got the solution to my problem at this clinic. Dr was very humble and helpful. It was very easy to contact  her at any time of treatment for any petty problems. After tooth extraction also they showed extra concern towards my health. Don't had wait for too long for any appointment.. I could easily leave my baby with neighbours and return home in an hour or so.  My recovery is also going well. Thanks a lot ",

Dr. Nair slowly worked on the problem area and today, I'm happy to say that my gums have never felt better. She has changed the way I saw dentistry by carefully explaining all my problems and their solution in a way I could understand, and then helping me get my dental health in order. I strongly recommend her. ",

By chance I got Dr. Bhumija\u2019s profile on Practo. After examining my teeth she explained what was the issue and what procedure had to be done. She didn\u2019t want to finish the procedure just for the sake of completing it. She split the sessions into 3 giving me time to cure some inflammation that had occurred before. She also gave a lot of helpful tips for me to do post completion of the sessions. She made sure that I was comfortable and the procedure was painless. She has an amazing sense of humour and is very nice with all patients which makes the visit to the clinic a smooth experience. I can\u2019t forget the memes that runs on the display near the work station which she had put together(worth your time). Overall, she is an amazing doctor and I guess the streak of having a bad dentist has finally come to an end. Thank you Dr. ",
