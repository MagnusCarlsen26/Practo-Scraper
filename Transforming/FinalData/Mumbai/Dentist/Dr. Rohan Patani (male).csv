I must confess that I was totally nervous but I had to get the implant done so I booked  an appointment  but was hesitant /reluctant about showing up. When I sat on the chair I was literally shivering but in no time your patience n tolerance made me feel comfortable and relaxed. The whole experience before and after the procedure was  very smooth n positive. It was painless no swelling or heavy bleeding n it healed fast. I am lucky to be one of your patient.
