My son was nervous and scared as he met that Dr. That Dr quickly examined and gave a treatment plan which I felt was too much for such a small kid. I was worried the way that Dr scared us if we didn't take quick action. I felt something is wrong.\nThen I visited Dr Sheena - She made my son so comfortable that his fear disappeared. The best thing about Dr. Sheena is she gave good amount of time to be friendly and then explained my son so well. Later gave us a frank opinion. She treated him well. Now my son is much better.\u00a0\u00a0My son has found a friend in her. I am glad I went to Dr. Sheena! thanks!!",

I was worried the way that Dr scared us if we didn't take quick action. I felt something is wrong.\nThen I visited Dr Sheena - She made my son so comfortable that his fear disappeared. The best thing about Dr. Sheena is she gave good amount of time to be friendly and then explained my son so well. Later gave us a frank opinion. She treated him well. Now my son is much better.\u00a0\u00a0My son has found a friend in her. I am glad I went to Dr. Sheena! thanks!!",
