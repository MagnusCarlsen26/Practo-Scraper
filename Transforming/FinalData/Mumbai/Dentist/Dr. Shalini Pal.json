I reached out to Dr. Pal because she came highly recommended. My subsequent experience with her work supports this feedback. She help me fixed an existing crown that had come off and with a couple of dental fillings. I felt that Dr. Pal was up-to-date on recent advances in the field of dental medicine and was able to give me several alternatives - including the most economical one, which was to try to fix my existing crown rather than going for a new expensive one. I was happy that she took the time to evaluate all my options and offer me the choices.  It has been about four months since my last visit to her office and I have been satisfied with all the dental work that she did. I will definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a good dentist. It also helps that her office is conveniently located very close to the Metro Stations at Marol Naka. ",

She adhered to the appointment time and didnt have me waiting. I have had my bad share of experiences with chain dental clinics, so Dr Pal's treatment truly came as a relief. Also she took great effort to minimize pain and discomfort and surprisingly even after 2 weeks, there is no pain. I would highly recommend her to anyone I know.",

I reached out to Dr. Pal because she came highly recommended. My subsequent experience with her work supports this feedback. She help me fixed an existing crown that had come off and with a couple of dental fillings. I felt that Dr. Pal was up-to-date on recent advances in the field of dental medicine and was able to give me several alternatives - including the most economical one, which was to try to fix my existing crown rather than going for a new expensive one. I was happy that she took the time to evaluate all my options and offer me the choices.  It has been about four months since my last visit to her office and I have been satisfied with all the dental work that she did. I will definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a good dentist. It also helps that her office is conveniently located very close to the Metro Stations at Marol Naka. ",
