From the outset, our experience with Dr. Sonal was nothing short of extraordinary, and I am thrilled to share our heartfelt appreciation.\nOur unique challenge of needing extensive dental work for my young daughter in two weeks seemed insurmountable until we found Dr. Sonal. She provided top-tier professionalism, expertise and compassion from the start, while coordinating the entire treatment plan remotely. She explained the procedure, timeline and what to expect thoroughly and patiently, leaving us feeling well-informed. Dr. organized appointments and treatment efficiently without compromising care quality. Meeting her in person, her warmth and genuine concern for my daughter's well-being, put us at ease. Her interaction with my daughter was heart-warming, creating a comfortable and trusting environment. Her skills, precision and ability to adapt to my daughter's temperament showcased her exceptional professionalism. The full mouth rehabilitation was a success thanks to her expertise and dedication. I cannot recommend her enough to parents seeking top-tier dental care for their children. Dr. Sonal thank you for making our visit to India both memorable and transformative. Your outstanding care and commitment to your patients has left a lasting impression on us, and we are immensely grateful for the positive impact on our daughter's dental health and overall well-being.",

A very calm and composed doctor, She explained the diagnosis so well that it\u2019s easy even for an uneducated person to understand the problem.\n\nThe clinic is maintained very well. Clean and hygienic.  \nShe has toys to engage kids and she engages the kid very well in the language you are comfortable with. \nShe gave star badge and toothpaste as a goodie to make kid feel happy to behave well which my son slept with whole night remembering her and waiting to visit her.\n\nShe is a amazing in handling kids and she herself is a mother so its easier for parents to relate too. My 3year old needed some cavity fillings and we were a little worried about his as he is quite anxious and hyper. But Dr. Shah took care of him very well.\nHer fees are also reasonable and goes by the basics of dental hygiene.\n\nSince we visited her during Covid-19 pandemic, she had ensured highest precautions for our visit and we were more than happy to comply with her guidelines.\n\nDr. Sonal practices from 2 clinics - Andheri (east) and Andheri (west) and she sees to it that she is available as per your convenience at any of the clinics.\n\nDr. Sonal Shah is highly recommendable for kids with dental issues. Her simplicity and genuineness stands out. \n\nGreat to know you Dr. Wish you Goodluck. \nMust say..if you get a chance do do visit her and there won't be a look back and disappointment.  Our kid would come out with a smile and a happy experience. \n\n",

My son is no more making fuss about visiting dentist clinic which was not the case earlier. \nMaking her patients quite comfortable is one of the good things we observed. \nThe hygiene is up to the mark given the current situation especially for young kids. \nWould certainly recommend all the parents who are still in doubt and delaying the visit to Dentist for their children. In my experience timely treatment and regular checks will keep the big problems away. ",

But Dr. Shah took care of him so well that we didn\u2019t even realise when the treatment was completed. Her fees are also reasonable and goes by the basics of dental hygiene. \n\nSince we visited her during Covid-19 pandemic, she had ensured highest precautions for our visit and we were more than happy to comply with her guidelines.\n\nDr. Shah practices from 2 clinics - Andheri (east) and Andheri (west).\n\nAll in all, Dr. Sonal Shah is highly recommendable for kids with dental issues.

From the outset, our experience with Dr. Sonal was nothing short of extraordinary, and I am thrilled to share our heartfelt appreciation.\nOur unique challenge of needing extensive dental work for my young daughter in two weeks seemed insurmountable until we found Dr. Sonal. She provided top-tier professionalism, expertise and compassion from the start, while coordinating the entire treatment plan remotely. She explained the procedure, timeline and what to expect thoroughly and patiently, leaving us feeling well-informed. Dr. organized appointments and treatment efficiently without compromising care quality. Meeting her in person, her warmth and genuine concern for my daughter's well-being, put us at ease. Her interaction with my daughter was heart-warming, creating a comfortable and trusting environment. Her skills, precision and ability to adapt to my daughter's temperament showcased her exceptional professionalism. The full mouth rehabilitation was a success thanks to her expertise and dedication. I cannot recommend her enough to parents seeking top-tier dental care for their children. Dr. Sonal thank you for making our visit to India both memorable and transformative. Your outstanding care and commitment to your patients has left a lasting impression on us, and we are immensely grateful for the positive impact on our daughter's dental health and overall well-being.",

A very calm and composed doctor, She explained the diagnosis so well that it\u2019s easy even for an uneducated person to understand the problem.\n\nThe clinic is maintained very well. Clean and hygienic.  \nShe has toys to engage kids and she engages the kid very well in the language you are comfortable with. \nShe gave star badge and toothpaste as a goodie to make kid feel happy to behave well which my son slept with whole night remembering her and waiting to visit her.\n\nShe is a amazing in handling kids and she herself is a mother so its easier for parents to relate too. My 3year old needed some cavity fillings and we were a little worried about his as he is quite anxious and hyper. But Dr. Shah took care of him very well.\nHer fees are also reasonable and goes by the basics of dental hygiene.\n\nSince we visited her during Covid-19 pandemic, she had ensured highest precautions for our visit and we were more than happy to comply with her guidelines.\n\nDr. Sonal practices from 2 clinics - Andheri (east) and Andheri (west) and she sees to it that she is available as per your convenience at any of the clinics.\n\nDr. Sonal Shah is highly recommendable for kids with dental issues. Her simplicity and genuineness stands out. \n\nGreat to know you Dr. Wish you Goodluck. \nMust say..if you get a chance do do visit her and there won't be a look back and disappointment.  Our kid would come out with a smile and a happy experience. \n\n",

Her fees are also reasonable and goes by the basics of dental hygiene. \n\nSince we visited her during Covid-19 pandemic, she had ensured highest precautions for our visit and we were more than happy to comply with her guidelines.\n\nDr. Shah practices from 2 clinics - Andheri (east) and Andheri (west).\n\nAll in all, Dr. Sonal Shah is highly recommendable for kids with dental issues. Her simplicity stands out. *** ** *** **** **** ** **** **** **** ****** ***",

Changes in my availability were also promptly and conviniently accommodated(we were in Mumbai for a short visit).

And since he was in terrible pain for months, we were told that general anaesthesia is the only option - and this had been causing us a great deal of stress.)\n\nHowever, within minutes of being with Dr. Sonal, my son took to her instantly - and miraculously, after a couple of brief interactions - sat for treatment willingly and with a smile on his face. My son also loved the talks they would have and really looked forward to his visits.\n\nI would rate Dr. Sonal as EXCELLENT on every parameter - be it friendliness, service, professionalism, and most importantly, patience.\n\nThank You, Dr. Sonal!",

Though it's on the expensive side, but it's really worthy. Following things I would like to share about her:1. In the first session, she checked her and described the problem in details.2. She was also available on phone, very few doctors share there number and are available on phone also. 3.She did 2root canals and despite of we being scared that how our daughter will make it, Dr sonal handled it perfectly well. Mishika (my daughter) even didn't realize when was the injection injected.  So I am happy with her treatment, and would recommend Dr. Sonal. ",
