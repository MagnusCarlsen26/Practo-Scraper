"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,NO,"Went there to get replaced one of the cap which I already had for more than 7 years and got cracked 
They suggested me a cap that had guarantee of 10 years and also mentioned that I will be getting the card for its validity which I never received even after asking them multiple times 
Had the cap replacement and within one week I had to go back because the fit was not proper and had gap between 2 teeths 
They did some temporary filling but within one week it washed off 
Whenever I try asking for an appointment they are never available on weekends , the lady on reception says she wil confirm when the doctors will be available but never got any response from them after repeated calls
Would not recommend them at all 
They will just speak good but that's what you will get.",2022-08-30 19:43:11,False,False,Kishori kadve,,,
