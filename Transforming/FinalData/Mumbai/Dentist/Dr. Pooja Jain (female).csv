I consulted her for puling my wisdom tooth.
I was told by other doctors that it would be a complex surgery since it can not be pulled straight. I also have fobia about blood and medical equipments.
Doctor Pooja handled me so well and did the job very very skillfully without any issues.

Thank you so much doctor
