Proper treatment  planning was done only after X-rays and teeth measurements which gave me precise judgement. All my questions were answered satisfactorily. He is very professional in his work and polite by his nature. The entire Dental team managed my monthly appointments and reminders were given on time. \n\nI opted for Ceramic braces. \nEMI option for the treatment gave me ease for payment. \n\nAfter the treatment was completed, the look of my face was entirely changed and gave me a beautiful smile. Now I am confident to smile and show my teeth unlike before. \n\nThank you so very much Dr Kavin for helping me to increase my confidence level. \nI would highly recommend Dr Kavin for Braces treatment.",
