They performed the surgery of implants in place of missing teeth. The procedure was totally painless thanks to good anaesthesia. One thing i had noticed that Dr Dhwani has a very light hand which gave me the satisfaction of being in safe hands. With a  few follow-up appointments Dr Dhwani was working patiently on me to help me replace the lost teeth as well as my smile and make me comfortable whenever i needed to.  Thank you to her patiance & ability to handal the patients well. I would recommend. ",
