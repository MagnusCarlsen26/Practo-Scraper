Made me comfortable at the dentist's chair as much I would be at home. She'd also check back in between my sessions to ensure everything was on track.\n\nAll in all, if you're in town looking for a professional, tailored, and reliable dentistry solution, look no further than Dr. Shruti at ToothWorks. She and her team of specialists are skilled in their trade to get you through even the complex of situations. \n\nThey also use some of the best medical-grade equipment for their treatment so you're left with the best results money can get.\n\nHighly recommended!",

Also provides flexibility to reschedule if her calender permits incase something urgent comes up.\n\nI would highly recommend her as a dentist for the family as my little daughter also didn\u2019t have too much of an issue sitting on the dreaded patient\u2019s chair.\ud83d\ude0aShruti has a way with kids and elders alike.\n\nKeep shining !

Having time constraints, I also needed to get it done promptly without further ado.\n\nNot only was Dr. Shruti and her team did a great job on the root canals, crowns, and teeth cleaning but made sure everything was taken care of in flexible time slots.\n\nHer patient-centric educative approach to dentistry helped a lot in making the right choices and alleviated any known fears I had with dentists. Made me comfortable at the dentist's chair as much I would be at home. She'd also check back in between my sessions to ensure everything was on track.\n\nAll in all, if you're in town looking for a professional, tailored, and reliable dentistry solution, look no further than Dr. Shruti at ToothWorks. She and her team of specialists are skilled in their trade to get you through even the complex of situations. \n\nThey also use some of the best medical-grade equipment for their treatment so you're left with the best results money can get.\n\nHighly recommended!",
