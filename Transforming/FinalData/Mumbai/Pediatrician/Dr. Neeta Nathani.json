In fact, we pride ourselves that we spend a lot of time and attention on each and every patient. \nContinuing the same medications just means that one has to be patient and wait. While we all would like to get our children cured in a jiffy, the fact remains that there are no magic bullets! Every medicine that is given has effects and has SIDE EFFECTS. Stronger the medication, more the side-effects.\nAs far as workshops are concerned, each is a different workshop and lasts for an hour each. A lot of time and effort has gone into each Powerpoint presentation. We make sure that they are useful to the parents and arrange to get aids (this time around much to your surprise the people who supplied us the kits for demonstration purposes were Ardo and not Medela, though we have asked them to show the kits earlier for demonstration and hands on experience. Unfortunately, we don't manufacture generic kits at home!!! You have chosen to be critical rather than appreciate the efforts put in to make the experience worthwhile to the attendees. Most people have been grateful and appreciative.\nBut we wish you all the very best in your search for a pediatrician that will suit your child.",

We reviewed your visit which was yesterday; you had come in asking for only vaccine administration. You then proceeded to spend half an hour in the consulting room discussing the feeding schedule, the vaccines that were to be administered, the bathing of the child, and in general the rearing of the child. This is what constitutes a consultation for your baby from a pediatrician.\nIf you wanted only vaccinations, you should have brought in a list of vaccines that you wanted to be administered and say, please administer these vaccines. You cannot ask for vaccines that are due at eight weeks of age. The knowledge and expertise required to determine which vaccines are needed at a particular age are what you pay for in a consultation.\nI understand that you would like to reduce the cost and who wouldn't? I suggest the following ways:\nYou could buy the vaccines from a friendly neighborhood chemist and get It administered by any doctor who is willing to. We do not administer vaccines brought in from outside, because we want to ensure that the vaccine is stored in perfect circumstances and we go to great lengths to maintain the cold chain that vaccines require. We even have a dial thermometer that checks the temperature inside the refrigerator where we keep the vaccines. We maintain electronic medical records and send out reminders to our patients for vaccinations due. Almost all our patients genuinely appreciate it.\nA better option is to take it from the municipal hospitals. You chose to interpret it as sarcasm, but it was in good faith. Here, the cold chain is assured, and on the cold chain, depends the effectiveness of the vaccine. This is a far better option than the previous one.\nWe realize that it is not possible to please everybody. We wish you all the best in your search for a cheap and effective vaccine and hope that your child a healthy future",

In fact, we pride ourselves that we spend a lot of time and attention on each and every patient. \nContinuing the same medications just means that one has to be patient and wait. While we all would like to get our children cured in a jiffy, the fact remains that there are no magic bullets! Every medicine that is given has effects and has SIDE EFFECTS. Stronger the medication, more the side-effects.\nAs far as workshops are concerned, each is a different workshop and lasts for an hour each. A lot of time and effort has gone into each Powerpoint presentation. We make sure that they are useful to the parents and arrange to get aids (this time around much to your surprise the people who supplied us the kits for demonstration purposes were Ardo and not Medela, though we have asked them to show the kits earlier for demonstration and hands on experience. Unfortunately, we don't manufacture generic kits at home!!! You have chosen to be critical rather than appreciate the efforts put in to make the experience worthwhile to the attendees. Most people have been grateful and appreciative.\nBut we wish you all the very best in your search for a pediatrician that will suit your child.",

We reviewed your visit which was yesterday; you had come in asking for only vaccine administration. You then proceeded to spend half an hour in the consulting room discussing the feeding schedule, the vaccines that were to be administered, the bathing of the child, and in general the rearing of the child. This is what constitutes a consultation for your baby from a pediatrician.\nIf you wanted only vaccinations, you should have brought in a list of vaccines that you wanted to be administered and say, please administer these vaccines. You cannot ask for vaccines that are due at eight weeks of age. The knowledge and expertise required to determine which vaccines are needed at a particular age are what you pay for in a consultation.\nI understand that you would like to reduce the cost and who wouldn't? I suggest the following ways:\nYou could buy the vaccines from a friendly neighborhood chemist and get It administered by any doctor who is willing to. We do not administer vaccines brought in from outside, because we want to ensure that the vaccine is stored in perfect circumstances and we go to great lengths to maintain the cold chain that vaccines require. We even have a dial thermometer that checks the temperature inside the refrigerator where we keep the vaccines. We maintain electronic medical records and send out reminders to our patients for vaccinations due. Almost all our patients genuinely appreciate it.\nA better option is to take it from the municipal hospitals. You chose to interpret it as sarcasm, but it was in good faith. Here, the cold chain is assured, and on the cold chain, depends the effectiveness of the vaccine. This is a far better option than the previous one.\nWe realize that it is not possible to please everybody. We wish you all the best in your search for a cheap and effective vaccine and hope that your child a healthy future",

But all my worries were put to rest by Dr. Neeta Nathani and team. The entire process was very well managed. Only one child and accompanying parent are allowed at one time. Masks and sanitizers are giving to every person walking in. Contact less process is maintained as far as possible. The best part about the whole experience was the preparedness on the part of the doctor and team. A stress free process for the parent and safe environment for the child. I highly recommend Dr. Neeta Nathani !!! ",

So Dr. Nathani asked me not to feed her milk from a bottle at night as it aggravates it and makes her vomit. I had tried but my daughter used to cry a lot and eventually I had to give her the bottle. \n\nDuring her last visit to clinic, Dr. Nathani told my daughter a very nice story about how the kitten toy in her clinic wanted a bottle to drink milk as kitten's mom was not with her and she was all alone.. so Dr. Nathani asked my daughter if she will help her and then my daughter agreed to give away the bottle to the kitten..that's it!!\n\nBelieve me guys, after that day not even once did she mention the bottle\ud83c\udf7c it was a miracle for me.. Dr. Nathani - thank you so much for this and I am forever grateful to you\ud83d\ude07 you are awesome!",

Fortunately I had Dr. Nathani yo guide me that my daughter must have gone through emotional stress. She advised me to encourage my daughter with rewards likes stars and other things.

She reaches teenage children in a gentle , empowering way . She  could explain to him about the necessity to eat different food values and jointly worked out  diet suggestions for him.

We are extremely proud that in a patriarchal society you have taken equal and more than equal responsibility in the care of your child. And it shows. You have a wonderful child! No, Dr. is no misandrist, though she is a feminist! It is entirely possible that she may have directed her attention to the grandmother. You will agree, that grandmothers have the greater experience and the love that they have for their grandchildren is unparalleled!\nBut, we appreciate your sentiments. Next time, if such a thing were to happen (we will do our best to avoid a repeat of this), please gently indicate it during the consult itself. Keeping it to yourself unnecessarily allows it to simmer and troubles oneself.\nThanks again for your kind comments and also bringing this out. This is how we improve our services.",

There was an instance though, when I visited her with my child along with my mother as my child was having a cold and fever. I'm a hands-on father and equal parent, and especially as my wife was traveling on work, was pretty much the primary care-taker and parent. However, it was disappointing that doctor barely made eye contact with me and refused to speak to me and stuck to only addressing her questions and comments to my mother, who had happened to accompany us. We hugely respect Dr's abilities and opinions but would request her to be mindful of not addressing or talking to to father.",

You have visited us last year at which time a list of age-appropriate recommended vaccines were given to you and a discussion about why they were necessary took place. You elected to take only influenza vaccine for your child, which is to be taken every year. This year you came back for the annual flu vaccine visit and inquired about which other vaccines have to be given.\nWe reviewed your file and said that the same vaccines that were advised earlier were recommended even now. It is unfortunate that you interpreted our recommendations as an attempt to scare you. Our job as a pediatrician is to make recommendations for vaccinations and treatment as per standard worldwide guidelines. Most of our patients take this advice in good faith and act upon it. They remain reasonably healthy. We are all different, some of us interpret recommendation as an attempt to scare someone. And that is OK too. Finally, the onus of accepting well-meaning advice that is given in good faith rests with the parent.\nWe do hope that your child remains protected from all the diseases despite not being vaccinated.",

Firstly there is PRINTED and LAMINATED list of immunization charges that is available to all patients at any time during their visit.\nThe charges include consultation for the immunization visit, the administration charges and the charges of the consumables required to inject the vaccine. Vaccination does not involve just administration of the said vaccine. In any case, the vaccine is in the vial, needs to be drawn with needle and syringe, and then injected using aseptic and correct technique in the correct location.\nEven nurses can inject vaccines and I am sure, it will be much cheaper to get it injected by them.",

We have to rely on a lot of other factors like the history given by parents (many times this is naturally altered by anxieties and concern), by our examination findings, by our intuitive perceptions gained through years of experience.\nThere are other pediatricians who charge more and some who charge less.
