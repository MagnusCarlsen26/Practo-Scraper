"Treatment satisfaction,","Children's Health,",0,0,YES,"I know Dr Piyush since last 3 years and since I met him for the first time after delivery of my third child, now all my kids are treated by him only. This is the level of trust and satisfaction I got from Dr Piyush. He has expertise in child health and he is one of the doctor who doesn‚Äôt prescribe too much medicine for kids. He believes in treating with ease and not with aggression.

If you guys have questions regarding your kid then definitely be ready for some arrogance coming from his side..

I would not recommend any other. Dr Shah is fantastic with the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. In most cases, he would not recommend a medicine unless absolutely needed.

When we moved to Mumbai from Chicago, it was a task to find a doctor who we were used to back then; someone who could treat with minimal drug intervention. Luckily we found Dr Shah.
