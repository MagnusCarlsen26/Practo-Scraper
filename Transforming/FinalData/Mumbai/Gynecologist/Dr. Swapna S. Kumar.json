We got to know about Dr. Swapna through a family friend & we are so glad that we made a decision to choose her for my entire pregnancy journey. I\u2019ve always told Dr. Swapna you have absolutely done justice to the name Mothercare & that you are the 1st mother to my child for taking such good care, making sure my baby is fine and for the safe healthy delivery. \nWe welcomed our first baby boy at Dr. Swapna\u2019s Mothercare Maternity Hospital Bhandup. Dr. Swapna is very humble, down to earth, understanding, patient above all a very good human being. She\u2019s always polite & pays a good listening ear, she gives you time & never rushes. You can ask her questions & she will always clarify them. With her you definitely get a feeling you are being heard & comforted. Even when you send her a text she responds very quickly which puts you at ease without making you feel any discomfort or worry. It was a great experience throughout my pregnancy journey & we\u2019ve taken back all good memories with us. \nMe, my husband and my family are ever grateful to Dr. Swapna and her entire staff for the smooth pregnancy sailing. The hospital is well maintained, clean & has a very good staff, the nurses & the maushis are really very cooperative, caring and supportive. \nI would strongly recommend Dr. Swapna to all who are looking for a good safe pregnancy journey. My personal experience.. genuinely ***** *** **** ******* a blessing!\nA BIG HUG & THANK YOU to our beautiful Dr. Swapna & her team! Loads of love & Blessings. ",

The staff was incredibly attentive, kind, and knowledgeable.\nThe operation went smoothly, and the aftercare was outstanding. Every aspect of our experience, from the initial consultation to the post-operative care, was handled with professionalism and compassion.\nThroughout the entire process, we felt like we were in good hands. The hospital was clean and well-maintained, and the staff were all so professional and caring. I can't thank them enough for the excellent service they provided. I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone in need of medical care. Special thanks toto Dr. Swapna mam, she is very calm, humble & down to earth person. Thank you for everything!",

Will be forever grateful to dear Mawshi's and Aai.\nDr Swapna's Husband for Spl care and counseling given\nReview: \nI Kriti Lall and Saurabh Deb (husband) visited Swapna mam' for UTI last year after finding her via Google and seeing her 5 star reviews. When we met her we loved her kind demeanor and bedside manner. She treated me for UTI and that time I didn't have any Gyneac dr so I started showing her for all ailments listed above. She treated me for Infertility and with first cycle I conceived. From Jan 2023 she gave me pregnancy care (Antenatal) and throughout pregnancy she also treated me for UTI, allergic rhinitis, cough and high fever etc.\nI received emergency care at 20 weeks and she  had seen me through numerous scares  which coincidentally happened mostly on Sunday nights \ud83d\ude00 with immediate care and dedication. She has wide network of Doctor's that have treated me even on Sundays. Swapana mam' was always available on whatsapp and call for all my queries and at times of emergencies.\nShe delivered my premature son at 3rd aug 2023 after trying to stop preterm contractions for 1 week via medicine and then I had to be admitted at 2nd aug night as I was in preterm labour which she tried to manage and gave IV medicine to stop labour and steroid injections for lung maturity of fetus. Baby was monitored continuously via NST throught night and till delivery. I was induced next day as I was in preterm labour and we tried for normal delivery.  But baby was in distress and heartbeat was dropping after 7-8 hours of labour we decided to have emergency c section and my son was born. I didn't had to wait a lot for surgery, the surgical team of anesthesiologist and assisting dr all arrived within 30mins which is commendable.  I was given spinal anesthesia and it went so smooth. Dr Swapana delivered my son and also had to remove fibroid 2.5 by2.5 by 3 cm that was at the c-section incision area. I had painless surgery and was coherent throughout delivery and post delivery I was sedated. Now m recovering fine.\nPost delivery I got admitted for chronic hypertension and postpartum depression and Mam' and entire staff and refferal dr's took good care of me and my BP is normal now. And I am recovering well from postpartum depression. I would 100% recommend Dr Swapna and her staff for all women health care.\nReview for Neonatal care: Dr Virat attended my son immediately post birth and gave necessary care to him. He is currently my son's treating dr and we are satisfied with his care. He too is available on whatsapp and answers any parenting queries that you may have at any point of day. \nReview for Counselling on Depression:\nSince my health deteriorated due to High BP posy delivery which I have since 2018 and I also had postpartum depression.  I reached out to Dr Swapna and she and her husband gave counseling to my husband and helped us to tackle this unknown territory. I got care from Reffered psychiatrist at her hospital and we also showed to Cardiologist at her referral. M really thankful for her kind support and kindness shown by her staff because I wasn't the ideal patient because of my postpartum depression. And they took care of me, my husband and baby. And was discharged once BP was stable. My son received phototherapy for his jaundice at Dr Swapna 's hospital too.\n\nPayment mode was gpay.",

But looking at low response rate, me and my husband decided to change the gynac. We were urgently looking for a gynac and within 15 mins of our first call, we got the appointment. She immediately consulted us and since then 9 months she has been an amazing doctor to me. I had less amniotic fluid and along with my breathing issues, the journey was difficult. However, she ensured nothing goes wrong and today we have a healthy baby boy with us. Thanks to Dr Swapna and her entire team. Right from ambience of her hospital to hospitality from her staff, everything is to the T. I got my child through Csection. The doctor first tried for normal delivery. However, In my case, my baby was healthy and his head was not able to make way through the birth canal and hence after 12 hours of labour Dr Swapna suggested c-section. She had mentally prepared me and my husband for this scenario 2 days ago of my delivery helping us understand all good-bad consequences. We must say her suggested Plan A (trying normal delivery) and plan B (csection on failure of Plan A) was well executed. She and her entire team ensured all goes well. She has the best of expertise and her advise does not limit to doctor-patient relationship. You feel family around her. Me and my husband strongly suggest Dr Swapna.",

She always made us feel comfortable and was very open to any doubts any time. During our correspondence, She was always precise in her consultation with no unwanted tests and meds.\nFinally with her guidance and medication, my wife conceived last year naturally and now we are blessed with a little princess. It was a C-section and the surgery was handled professionally without any hassle.\nWe thank Dr. Swapna for her expertise and are always grateful to you...\nHighly Recommended.",

Despite the limitations of covid scenario,  she understood  the problems of the patient, quickly and resolved the same with ease. She dedicates herself in curing/treating the patient.  She responded everytime,  even during nights,  in addressing the issues of patient.  We are lucky to get such a good gynaecologist in mulund area. She is soft spoken,  self motivated and proactive. Thank u madam. ",
