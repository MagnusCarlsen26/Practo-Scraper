Usually doctors are in a hurry to get done with the consultation, do not listen to the patient\u2019s issue at hand, not patient enough to understand what\u2019s happening on the other end. Once I took a consultation via Practo and was suggested to take scans for a normal diarrhoea and was given tons of tabs which was of no help. I had contacted Dr. Renubala to seek assistance with termination of my pregnancy and she was very patient to hear me out and assist. We connected on video call earlier which kept disconnecting and she tried multiple times to connect via audio and video and since that could not be established she sat with me through chat till all my queries were resolved. She was very patient in listening, chat was not terminated till all my queries were answerer and until she was sure I\u2019ve got answers for what I wanted. Even with in person consultation I\u2019ve had experience where doctors don\u2019t want to listen and are always in a hurry to get done. Would definitely recommend people to opt her as she is a value addition to the doctor\u2019s profession, very importantly listens and answers and gives assurance that she is there to help us during our difficult times.",

She just doesn't listen to your concerns but gives practical and empathetic suggestions followed by right treatment. She is currently helping me with my Pcos, Thyroid and Irregular menstrual cycle. Right from giving an overview about importance of better lifestyle to my other hygiene I am totally satisfied and happy with her consultation and the help that I am receiving from her as a doctor. She made me feel hopeful about my future and right guidance about things that can work better. I would definitely suggest her to people. Thank you so much Dr. Renubala Raut. ",

Usually doctors are in a hurry to get done with the consultation, do not listen to the patient\u2019s issue at hand, not patient enough to understand what\u2019s happening on the other end. Once I took a consultation via Practo and was suggested to take scans for a normal diarrhoea and was given tons of tabs which was of no help. I had contacted Dr. Renubala to seek assistance with termination of my pregnancy and she was very patient to hear me out and assist. We connected on video call earlier which kept disconnecting and she tried multiple times to connect via audio and video and since that could not be established she sat with me through chat till all my queries were resolved. She was very patient in listening, chat was not terminated till all my queries were answerer and until she was sure I\u2019ve got answers for what I wanted. Even with in person consultation I\u2019ve had experience where doctors don\u2019t want to listen and are always in a hurry to get done. Would definitely recommend people to opt her as she is a value addition to the doctor\u2019s profession, very importantly listens and answers and gives assurance that she is there to help us during our difficult times.",

She just doesn't listen to your concerns but gives practical and empathetic suggestions followed by right treatment. She is currently helping me with my Pcos, Thyroid and Irregular menstrual cycle. Right from giving an overview about importance of better lifestyle to my other hygiene I am totally satisfied and happy with her consultation and the help that I am receiving from her as a doctor. She made me feel hopeful about my future and right guidance about things that can work better. I would definitely suggest her to people. Thank you so much Dr. Renubala Raut. ",
