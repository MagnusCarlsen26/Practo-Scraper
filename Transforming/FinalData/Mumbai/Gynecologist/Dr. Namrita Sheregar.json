Her excellent patient relations, knowledge, and professionalism made my pregnancy experience delightful.\n\nFrom my very first visit, Dr. Namrita made me feel welcomed and answered all my queries. As an anxious person, she could sense my apprehensions and always calmed me down. She is a true professional and a non-judgmental gynecologist. I could openly discuss all my fears and concerns with her, and she not only consulted me but also provided counseling and put me at ease.\n\nDr. Namrita\u2019s special interest in high-risk obstetrics was evident in her approach. She was available for calls even at 1 AM, ensuring that I felt supported throughout. Her guidance during my delivery was invaluable, and I delivered my baby boy under her care.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Namrita Sheregar to anyone seeking compassionate and expert gynecological and obstetric care. Thank you, Dr. Namrita, for making my pregnancy journey memorable and reassuring!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a gynecologist who truly cares about her patients, Dr. Namrita Sheregar is an excellent choice",

As an anxious person, she could sense my apprehensions and always calmed me down. She is a true professional and a non-judgmental gynecologist. I could openly discuss all my fears and concerns with her, and she not only consulted me but also provided counseling and put me at ease.\n\nDr. Namrita\u2019s special interest in high-risk obstetrics was evident in her approach. She was available for calls even at 1 AM, ensuring that I felt supported throughout. Her guidance during my delivery was invaluable, and I delivered my baby boy under her care.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Namrita Sheregar to anyone seeking compassionate and expert gynecological and obstetric care. Thank you, Dr. Namrita, for making my pregnancy journey memorable and reassuring!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a gynecologist who truly cares about her patients, Dr. Namrita Sheregar is an excellent choice",

She patiently addressed all of my queries and concerns, ensuring I was well-informed every step of the way. Her ability to explain complex medical concepts in a clear and compassionate manner made me feel empowered and confident in my decisions.When it came time for my C-section delivery, Dr. Namita's skill and professionalism truly shone. She and her team ensured that the entire process was smooth and as stress-free as possible. Her dedication to my well-being and that of my baby was evident throughout, and I couldn't have asked for a better advocate during this crucial time.What sets Dr. Namita apart is not only her medical competence but also her genuine care and empathy. She goes above and beyond to make her patients feel valued and supported. Her post-delivery care was exceptional, and I always felt like I had a trusted partner on this incredible journey into motherhood.I cannot thank Dr. Namita enough for the incredible care she provided during my pregnancy and delivery. She is a true gem and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking compassionate, expert, and personalized care. Thank you, Dr. Namita, for helping make my pregnancy and delivery experience so positive and memorable.",

For instance, doctor-patient communication during pregnancy is especially delicate because of the frequent and intimate interactions patients have with their doctors \u2013 not to mention the prenatal emotions and health behaviors that have significant effects on birth outcomes. This is further complicated by the nature of prenatal care, where patients may see multiple doctors within the same practice, or see one doctor during pregnancy but another during delivery, because doctors and patients may not have as much time to get to know each other. e internet for advice. It is simply too easy to assume a certain diagnosis based off of the internet that may not actually be the case.\n\n",

I delivered my baby girl in November under her guidance and the experience has been just amazing. Being new to Mumbai, when I came to know about my pregnancy, my first job was to find a gynaecologist and luckily I decided to visit Dr. Namrita. On my first visit itself she made me feel so welcomed and answered all my queries. I am an anxious person; without even telling her, she could feel it from my voice and calmed me down whenever required. She is knowledgeable, a true professional and a non judgemental Gynecologist. I could discuss all my fears and apprehensions with her openly. She not only consulted me but also counseled me and put me at ease. Always available on calls even at 1 AM at night. I will 100% recommend her.",

She will be straight forward in her approach and not recommend any unnecessary tests or checkups. She\u2019s the one who will even pick up your call in the middle of the night during any kind of emergency and she will answer to all the thousand silly questions which first time moms have (saying from my own experience). Anyone who resides in Andheri Or close to Andheri, I strongly recommend dr Namrita. She\u2019s a angel. ",
